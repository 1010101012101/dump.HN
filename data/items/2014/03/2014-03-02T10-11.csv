Your 2000 member national legislature will still be mostly made up of <i>professional</i> politicians.  A given politician will still be way closer to another politician (even from an opposing party), than the people.  A bit like 2 NBA players are closer to each other than they are to their respective fans.<p>Referendums are not elections.  Citizens will do better on laws than they do on people, <i>if</i> the laws affect them directly.  And it&#x27;s not only laws.  Some things are way more important than laws: budget policies, whether to build a hospital there, destroy a school here…  More generally, if you need >110 IQ to understand a law, then there is a problem with the law itself.  Like computer code, laws should be readable.<p>Some roles do need individuals in charge.  How to select them?  By random trial of course.  Also make sure they are double and triple checked before, during, and after their mandate.  The Athenians had such mechanisms that we can emulate.  Here is an example: if the sheriff, randomly selected for a year, is mean to people, someone he has been mean to may well be sheriff later.  That&#x27;s a rather weak control mechanism, but you get the idea.<p>-----<p>Anyway, my central point isn&#x27;t about elections.  My central point is that people who are used to rule wrote the constitution themselves.  People of power wrote the rules of power.  Such a conflict of interest is unacceptable and can only lead to a broken system.  The constitution therefore needs a complete rewrite, which probably means gathering a constituent assembly.<p>But.<p>Who do you think should be in this assembly?  Certainly not people of power, or we will have the conflict of interest all over again.  I&#x27;m not against elections as a mechanism, but do you see a way to have elections which does <i>not</i> select people who are used to rule?",1393757965
7328678,comment,7327933,7328353,3,0,tempestn,,,"I&#x27;m both a father and a startup founder, and I fully agree with his comment and don&#x27;t think it sounds bad at all.  Being a parent takes a good chunk of your time and energy, at least if you want to do a good job of it.  That leaves less time and energy for other things, making it more difficult to do things that require a ton of both, like start a company.  As gizmo686 says above, these challenges can of course be overcome, and obviously I feel it was worth doing so.  But the statements are still true, and I don&#x27;t see how acknowledging them makes one a bad person.<p>This <i>is</i> a tricky area of ethics though.  Ideally everyone would have equal opportunity to do anything they want to do, including start a company and/or have a family.  It is generally culturally accepted that it would be unfair for one&#x27;s marital or parental status to have an effect on their career prospects.  And I agree that that&#x27;s a noble ideal.  But imagine you&#x27;re an investor with two hypothetical identical investments to choose from.  They are identical in every way except that you know one of the founders is single and plans to remain so at least while getting the company off the ground, and the other is a parent with six children (to use an extreme example).  It seems reasonable to expect that the former would be more likely to succeed, all else being equal.  As much as you would like both to have equal opportunities, is it fair to force you to ignore this piece of evidence when making your choice?  (What if you&#x27;re investing others&#x27; money and have a fiduciary responsibility?)<p>There are two conflicting ideals here as I see it, and no perfect way to reconcile them fairly.<p>At least with my hypothetical above, you could say that the &quot;family founder&quot; chose to make family a priority, so in some way it is fair that they sacrifice some potential to receive investment in their startup.  Even if we accept that though, it gets trickier if you instead consider male and female founders, both planning to have families.  For simple biological reasons, even aside from cultural ones, the female time will probably have less time to focus on the startup, to <i>some</i> extent at least, but obviously she didn&#x27;t choose to be female.  So again you have this conflict, where we would certainly like to treat everyone equally, especially in areas they have no control over, but at the same time it is unfair to force people to make less optimal investments <i>all else being equal</i>.<p>You could draw parallels to favoring more attractive applicants to hospitality jobs, or even more intelligent applicants to programming jobs say.  You don&#x27;t control your intelligence, so it&#x27;s not really <i>fair</i> that it affects your prospects.  On the other hand, it&#x27;s certainly not fair to force an employer to hire a less intelligent applicant.  It seems like the general rule in cases like this is that if the difference materially affects a one&#x27;s ability to do the job, generally it is ok to &#x27;discriminate&#x27; based on it.  So it&#x27;s ok to discriminate based on weight or skin colour for an actor, but obviously not for a programmer.  The contentious areas seem to be ones where the (potential) impact on performance is less direct.  The parenthood debate would seem to fall under that category.  A more obvious one would be something like physical appearance of waiters and waitresses.  It&#x27;s not as clear cut as an actor, where it&#x27;s obvious that matching the part matters, but at the same time it&#x27;s fairly obvious that having attractive waitstaff could be beneficial for a restaurant.<p>It seems to me that the average societal reaction in these grey areas is a sort of subconscious group decision that the benefits to one side outweigh the detriments to the other.  So if we say it&#x27;s <i>wrong</i> to discriminate based on parental status, what we&#x27;re really saying is that we as a society value parenthood sufficiently that it takes precedence to some extent over other rights.  These kinds of tradeoffs are made all the time; for example, we value free speech sufficiently that in many cases we allow it to override people&#x27;s right not to be subjected to material they find objectionable.  We value a basic standard of living such that we &#x27;forcibly&#x27; deprive wealthier members of society of their property (via taxes) in order to redistribute a portion of it to the less fortunate.  (In fact, we force people to contribute to many things that they may not personally support via taxes.)<p>Anyway, this ended up being far more than I had planned to write, but I guess my basic point is that few things are black and white.  Usually some sort of compromise is necessary, and the goal is to find the one that best matches our societal values.  Often our instinctive reactions to these grey areas are representative of a personal or societal value that we haven&#x27;t fully consciously expressed.",1393757954

(and don&#x27;t get me wrong here, I&#x27;m not stuck in the Flash age, but it really was poetry and really amazing UI)<p>that&#x27;s about the time I started writing ActionScript and learning how to use (Macromedia) Flash to do some basic animations. I got as far as teaching myself the Flex Framework, almost had a paying customer for a Flex project, but it actually never went beyond the hobby phase. the Flash picture portfolio I wrote for myself is still out there and I love it. it&#x27;s ActionScript 8.0 but I never had any compatibility issues with any browser or Flash version. I looks the same everywhere. and I bet the compiled swf file, which is still online, dates back to 2003 or something.\nnowadays thefwa.com has been rebranded to &quot;the Favourite Website Award&quot; - it used to stand for &quot;the Flash Website Award&quot;. that&#x27;s where I discovered group94.com a Belgium-based advertising agency who were writing some crazy ActionScript back then. nowadays their website has gone HTML. it looks boring. and basic. it looks just like all the other agency portfolio websites out there. it used to be funny and clever and poetic. it used to be well... flashy. take a look at the Flash scene 10 years ago and take a look at how web interaction has evolved: nowadays you want something cool, you get it parallaxed... millions of websites all taking on the <i></i>same<i></i> design element. the Flash websites I saw were all different in many ways. the Flash world was a place of inspiration.<p>I don&#x27;t really remember when I stopped reading thefwa.com (which I used to do on a daily basis). I didn&#x27;t really notice when Flash got replaced almost everywhere by HTML(5). I just did now. and I feel sorry for it, because Flash used to be (and still is) a great tool and a great concept.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not talking here about the mediocre Flash world. there&#x27;s plenty of bad Flash websites out there. I&#x27;m talking about the glamorous one. and in my opinion the glamorous Flash world from 5-10 years ago is still more artsy than the glamorous HTML5 world nowadays.",1393757379

Perhaps it was the financial crisis and the feeling that the moment of leapfrogging over a peaked and declining West was finally on the horizon.  Perhaps it was an internal squabble amongst political elites or wealthy families.

There is no way a Russian government will ever leave Crimea to NATO or the EU, end of; as I said elsewhere, it would be like Panama being left to the Chinese or the Russians.<p>A sane US/EU strategy would have worked to peacefully de-federate Crimea from West Ukraine first, before bidding for Kiev. That&#x27;s the realistic, win-win approach. Trying to get that peninsula out of Russian control is an overreach that Putin will not accept.

It&#x27;s seems bizarre now but I took a lot of ridicule from people when I tried to insist on building things the standard compliant way back in 2004. I remember being told that things I had personally designed specifically to be built in HTML couldn&#x27;t be done. The situation was bananas, flash had turned everyone into zombies. And while you wouldn&#x27;t be fired for mentioning JavaScript, you would jump to the top of the naughty list. Advocating JavaScript back then was like advocating kiddie fiddling.<p>And so web standards were kept back. So browsers were held back. (Why should Microsoft make a better browser? Nobody uses HTML or CSS anyway?) and so the whole web was held back. I look at a lot of the stuff we do today, and I see no reason we couldn&#x27;t have been doing it back in 2004 other than the fact that flash was easy. It&#x27;s was the crack that turned the web into a digital ghetto with developers high on their own success, site owners tripping off the rich, colourful and &quot;fully immersive experiences&quot; (there&#x27;s a phrase you don&#x27;t hear anymore) of their own all singing, all dancing and utterly unusable websites. Meanwhile, users were left to scrounge around in all that dirt looking for scraps of anything barely edible.<p>If IE was Hitler, Flash would be Stalin. Sure Hitler was a bad guy and he shoulders all the blame, but he was rank a rank amateur compared to our friend and ally Joseph &quot;evil personified&quot; Stalin.<p>On top of all that, the flash player is a piece of junk. Always has been, always will be and I make no apologies for feeling smug when they started scrambling to get it working on mobile. &quot;Oh no!&quot; I would say, &quot;have all those years of showing nothing but contempt for the people who have to run you&#x27;re buggy, resource hungry piece of shit plugin left you up shit creek without a paddle?&quot; Good riddance I say.",1393756261

However, the temperature of the GPU increases noticeably while watching videos (i.e. it is doing more work) and the speed of the fan increases, too. It&#x27;s like this with every <video> element I put to play. With Flash, any increase in resource consumption is unnoticeable.<p>Some days ago I booted my old (5-6 years old) desktop, which only has Intel integrated graphics, with Chrome. In HTML5 YouTube, playback skipped a lot of video frames, and often sound would have interruptions too (especially if I switched tabs or windows and went to do something else). The CPU became much busier. This would happen on both Windows and Linux. With Flash, videos play just fine, and the CPU definitely doesn&#x27;t get as busy. The version of Chrome is the same on all four OS installs.<p>Conclusion: while I like HTML5 video much more than Flash video (if not for anything else, because I don&#x27;t need plugins, even if they are bundled with the browser), it still has a long way to go, as currently it uses much more resources than Flash to achieve the same goal.

I don&#x27;t think the case has been sufficiently made that DRM is bad in and of itself. I am all in favour of open standards, no vendor lock in, I&#x27;m in favour of open source and free software. Let me reiterate just so there&#x27;s no confusion, I use Ubuntu on the desktop, I use Gentoo on the server, I have an Nexus phone and tablet. However, I fail to see how DRM is bad in and of itself. I would prefer if all software was done in the open but I don&#x27;t think proprietary software is evil or morally bad. I think it increases the likelihood of harm to the user somewhere down the line but I don&#x27;t think the harm is inevitable. In the case of DRM I think the harm is even more remote, what do you think?<p>Side note: what irks me is multiple formats ...

To women is says; all you lack are role models and community support. Which has a 1950s, &quot;even a woman can do it!&quot; Ring to it.<p>To men, it reinforces the idea that women are being kept down by men. Maybe that&#x27;s true and I&#x27;m simply not getting invited to the meetings where men gather to conspire to keep women down and out of the board room. Or maybe that doesn&#x27;t happen and the real reason there are fewer women in the very high positions is a result of something else.<p>There is a vocal minority of dick heads out there who hate women and happen to be in tech. My guess is that they hate women for the very reason you would expect a &quot;geek/nerd&quot; to hate women; because girls ignored them, and were probably mean to them. The power balance in school between boys and girls goes a long way to explaining the animosity between some men and women in my opinion.<p>If I were asked to organise a talk to encourage women to become founders, I would ask an expert in risk assessment to speak, because we know it to be true that women are more risk averse than men.

While you can use ISM/UNII bands (&quot;free&quot;/open) spectrum (and there are GSM base stations that run in 900Mhz), you have to deal with interference from every other device in the band.  Cell systems are designed to generally not interfere with each other through RF planning and synchronization of TX/RX timeslots. They don&#x27;t work well in the face of outside noise.<p>Now, in areas where cell providers don&#x27;t see ROI on a physical build they will sublease spectrum to a local operator in exchange for roaming rights (sometimes transparently--you might not see &quot;roaming&quot; on your phone).

And I find myself wishing all the time for a phone that simply runs Debian Stable.<p>Tight security?  Well, how about Stagefright?  Cyanogen no longer supports my phone.  Even when they did, it wasn&#x27;t well-supported: each new release had a high chance of breaking something fundamental.  Right now I&#x27;m stuck on a &quot;milestone&quot; release that isn&#x27;t even the newest one (it&#x27;s over a year old now!), because later ones all have some unacceptable problem, like GPS not working or cell data not working.  I can&#x27;t just install an updated browser component package, because Android is <i>monolithic</i>.  On Debian it&#x27;d be in a package like libwebkit, and it&#x27;d be a simple &quot;apt-get upgrade&quot; away.<p>So I&#x27;m stuck with a vulnerable Android version.  If I try to upgrade to fix it, I&#x27;ll lose GPS or cellular data.  The only way to get a fix is to <i>buy a new phone.</i><p>Now Google is trying to push more of the components into its Google Play Service app/framework.  So, great: more parts can be upgraded independently of the monolithic core.  But that also means that Google can push out updates to more components <i>without my knowledge or consent</i>: <i></i>not<i></i> great.  That means more instances of feeling something warm in my pocket, pulling out my phone, and finding that Google Play Services has kept my phone awake for 10 hours and my battery is at 12%.<p>This has happened to me on multiple occasions: one day my phone works fine.  The next day it eats the battery like candy.  I didn&#x27;t change any settings or install any updates--Google merely decided to push out an automatic update to its APKs without my knowledge or consent, and Google Play Services constantly crashes every 5 seconds, popping up a dialog box that I have to manually dismiss.  I can&#x27;t even do a simple task like send an SMS or check my email, because every 5 seconds it pops up another &quot;Unfortunately...&quot; box.  There&#x27;s no practical way to roll it back, nor even to report the problem.  The best I can do is find people reporting the same problem on Reddit and hope that Google gets its act together so I can actually have a usable phone again; maybe one morning I&#x27;ll wake up and my phone will not be &quot;sick&quot; anymore.  In the meantime I have a really dumb &quot;smartphone&quot; that keeps my leg warm.<p>I have had high hopes for Android, but I now consider it to be a mess, and consider Google to be a highly irresponsible steward.  I don&#x27;t want an iPhone, but if someone wants a reliable smartphone without nasty surprises, they are probably better served with one.",1444373552

One of the first questions in the Q&A that followed my talk was:<p>> “In the presentation you just gave, you were showing documents that were TS/SCI [top secret, sensitive compartmented information] and things like that. Since documents started to become published, has the NSA issued a declass order for that?”<p>> I took the opportunity to explain the government’s dilemmas when classified information becomes available to anyone with an Internet connection. “These documents, by and large, are still classified,&quot; I said. &quot;And in many cases, if you work for the government and you have clearance, you’re not allowed to go look at them… Now, it’s perfectly rational for them to say, we’re not going to declassify everything that gets leaked because otherwise we’re letting someone else decide what’s classified and what’s not. But it gets them wound up in pretty bad knots.”<p>> My remarks did not answer the question precisely enough for one post-doctoral research engineer. He stood, politely, to nail the matter down.<p>> “Were the documents you showed tonight unclassified?” he asked.<p>> “No. They’re classified still,” I replied.<p>> “Thank you,” he said and resumed his seat.<p>> Eugene Spafford, a Purdue professor of computer science who has held high clearances himself, wrote to me afterward. “We have a number of ‘junior security rangers’ on faculty and staff who tend to be ‘by the book.’ Unfortunately, once noted, that is something that cannot be unnoted.”<p>> Sure enough, someone filed a report with the above-mentioned Information Assurance Officer, who reported in turn to Purdue’s representative at the Defense Security Service. By the terms of its Pentagon agreement, Purdue was officially obliged to be <i>shocked to find that spillage is going on</i> at a talk about Snowden and the NSA. Three secret slides, covering perhaps five of my 90 minutes on stage, required that video be wiped in its entirety.<p>> This was, I think, a rather devout reading of the rules.

10358501,comment,10347063,10356312,0,0,pron,,,"> I do remember being impressed by the logical consistency<p>While I&#x27;m very fond of anarchism (<i>not</i> its libertarian interpretations), I&#x27;ve always find its libertarian forms completely <i>in</i>consistent (and very, very restrictive and far from free) under a guise of consistency (and freedom). The key is that everything can look consistent if you ignore the facts. It&#x27;s ethics for spherical cows, and it&#x27;s not simple but simplistic. <i>Every</i> ethics begins that way, but then there are lots of complications that stem from how the world works. Libertarian anarchism stops there, at the logic stage. It describes a consistent model -- for spherical cows -- and chooses not to examine whether the model fits the real world.<p>The main issue is what constitutes aggression. A clever teenager could say, &quot;let&#x27;s draw the line at physical harm!&quot; but an educated scientist <i>knows</i> that physical aggression is rare, and is only used in those circumstances where common aggression fails. Common aggression works by intimidation (as I&#x27;ve shown -- even in the animal kingdom) and emergent social forces (like economics). You can only draw those arbitrary lines if you <i>choose not to study aggression</i>. If you choose not to learn something, then everything seems simple and consistent because it remains a Platonic ideal. Once you study aggression and see how it really works you realize that preventing aggression requires a very intricate ethics.<p>Which is why I&#x27;m for anarchism <i>without</i> false and arbitrary restrictions on aggression (which only serve to increase it in its common forms), <i>or</i> an intricate system of ethics and law that serves to really reduce aggression, but is a far cry from anarchy.<p>Just to very quickly explain the difference, in a real anarchy, the threat of physical harm must always be present to offset other forms of aggression. If it isn&#x27;t, there&#x27;s no balance in the system. The rich can inflict economic aggression without fear of reprecussion. Once you add &quot;no-agression&quot; to anarchy, you&#x27;ve basically created a very lopsided, very non-free, and a very inconsistent system.<p>> Yes. I don&#x27;t understand how you view that as a restriction on free speech, maybe the point of confusion is around your use of the word &quot;allowed&quot; - because there is no central authority to grant permission in a state of anarchy.<p>I used the word &quot;allowed&quot; loosely in this case, to mean a combination of ethics and a possible enforcement structure. The belief that only a central authority grants permission is a common mistake among libertarians, that, as I said, stop at the logical reasoning stage and don&#x27;t examine the facts. Centralized government is a recent invention, at least in the Western world -- 400 years or so (that the Roman Empire appears to us like a central authority is an anachronism based on extrapolation from what we know). Yet enforcement has existed throughout human history in much more diffuse ways.<p>Now, back to the example. So you say it&#x27;s OK to say, &quot;if you deny evolution, I will stab you&quot;. Fine. Now what happens when I deny evolution? If I know you&#x27;ll never stab me then there must be some enforcement at play. But that means that I know your threat to be empty to begin with, and so no intimidation took place. In the real world, that&#x27;s not the case. The possibility that you will stab me is always on the table. If so, stabbing me for denying evolution is most certainly a restriction of my free speech. And if that option exists, intimidating me with the threat also restricts my free speech.<p>> It leads to a highly distributed system of justice, where each individual relies upon their own system of ethics to mete out justice<p>Because that&#x27;s how human society existed until not too long ago, it isn&#x27;t some thought exercise, and we know how that looks in practice. That <i>is</i> a form of governance, but without a central authority.<p>>  your first two paragraphs are totally wrong<p>No, they are not. Your confusion stems from the anachronistic conflation of laws with a central state. Laws are rules based on ethics with some enforcement mechanism. That enforcement can be excommunication. In fact, that <i>was</i> the primary form of enforcement until not long ago. A highly distributed system of justice was the norm (again, at least in the West; I haven&#x27;t studied the history of Asia).",1444372633

So:<p>The thinking behind the file system layout had nothing to do with the available disk space or having a read-only file system. It was, originally, entirely a hedge against <i>corruption</i>; before journaling file systems and all that jazz, if your system was hit by a power outage and it was in the middle of some operation or another it might corrupt whatever file system it was working in.<p>So, you would create multiple partitions and have different directories as the mount point for each partition. Say for instance that, as a cautious sysadmin, you put /sbin on its own partition. Excellent! Since /sbin rarely gets touched, if everything goes pear-shaped, the system will still boot into single user mode and you can use tools like fsck and mount, which are under the uncorrupted /sbin partition and are statically linked. If you couldn&#x27;t for some reason recover the file system on a particular partition, then you might be looking at having to load, say, /etc from backups, instead of everything under /.<p>Over time, other software started to take advantage of multiple partition layouts to protect you from getting hurt. You could mark some partitions noexec, nosuid, or restrict operations like rm or rsync to specific partitions without having to worry about whether or not they&#x27;ll crawl out of that partition and eat the world.<p>But that&#x27;s pretty old-school now. As file systems improved and corruption was less of a problem and everybody sort of gave up caring about what options rm accepted, more and more systems just mounted everything under / so that you would be maximally boned if ever there was a filesystem problem. Progress!<p>OpenBSD is one of few operating systems left that has a set of recommendations for how to partition your system: <a href=""http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Partitioning"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html#Partitioning</a><p>So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m not a fan of &quot;novel file system layouts&quot;; the previous layout was designed and existed for some good reasons and I have a hunch that the people that are happy about novel file system layouts don&#x27;t know about those reasons.",1444371435

This is the real reason why systemd uses key=value stores for units; merging them is trivial while merging shell scripts is decidedly not.<p>You should look at how OpenRC handles service dependency specification. It&#x27;s at <i>least</i> as flexible as the system you describe in systemd. :)<p>> Putting the overrides in a separate directory is a pretty nice decision...<p>Yep. At dependency graph generation time, OpenRC examines its master config file at /etc/rc.conf as well as config files in /etc/conf.d/ for -among other things- additions to the need, use, before, &etc declarations in the depends section of a given service&#x27;s init script. To augment -say- the &quot;use&quot; list in the openvpn service, either add the line<p><pre><code>  rc_use=&quot;my_custom_service&quot;\n</code></pre>\nto /etc/conf.d/openvpn , <i>or</i> add the line<p><pre><code>  openvpn_rc_use=&quot;my_custom_service&quot;\n</code></pre>\nto the OpenRC master config file at /etc/rc.conf . If I -say- wanted to override OpenVPN&#x27;s default dependency on the &quot;net&quot; virtual service, I would add<p><pre><code>  rc_need=&quot;!net&quot;\n</code></pre>\nto /etc/conf.d/openvpn (or perform a similar transformation as before and store in /etc/rc.conf).<p>> I can make that symlink manually, if I want, or I can call...<p>To add the openvpn service to the &quot;custom_init&quot; and &quot;default&quot; runlevels, I would simply do<p><pre><code>  rc-update add openvpn custom_init default\n</code></pre>\nIf I omit the runlevel, the service is added to the current runlevel. I <i>could</i> screw around with symlinks if I cared to, but why would I? :)<p>The OpenRC configuration processing system is <i>substantially</i> more powerful than I describe, handles the processing of OpenRC-standard config files [0] automatically, and lets you shift the complexity of a configurable init script that <i>should</i> be in a config file into a config file.<p>Because my overrides and augmentations to the distro-supplied init scripts are in text files stored in standard places, I -too- can easily put them in version control and track their changes over time.<p>[0] Which -shockingly enough- look exactly like what any Linux programmer would expect a non-XML non-JSON text config file to look like. ;)",1444371355

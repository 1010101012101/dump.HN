141359,comment,140841,140841,0,0,xekonic,,,"Like the design simplicity. A possible idea on how to differentiate it from reddit. Consider having an option that makes it almost like a media producer.<p>What I mean is, while the post link is interesting, when it comes to something like Hacker News I always click through for the comments, because they're usually great. What about combining this idea with almost a kind of private access and putting the point system to more use?<p>For example: You have the link (or topic) that is submitted as they are now, and then the discussion that occurs from the link (or topic). As people like it, they vote it up or down (giving it points). However, all this discussion is taking place not in public view (recalling the invite only). But each day a submission goes public (also opening up comments) based on which one has the most points. This essentially creates 1 piece of interesting material a day (similar to that of a blog) based on dynamic discussion.<p>Just a thought.",1205981832

For some of us it is, for some of us it is not, and it isn't universal. I don't think it's safe to assume that it's what is is best for everyone and try to encourage them to do it. It clearly is not the best course through life for most people.<p>It's incredibly selfish to try to convince others to sacrifice their own happiness to make the world a better place for you and to do what you think is important. If someone is happier working at Wal-Mart, and it means they won't author the next web-based [insert MS Office product here] why try to convince them otherwise?

Phun (no pun intended) isn't really a ""game"" to me, it's more of a software toy.<p>I think it might be because realistic rigid-body physics are still fairly novel in games, and seeing realistic reactions in-game is inherently satisfying for some reason.

141327,comment,140602,140602,0,0,cmos,,,"It is good to see a contradicting post here from time to time, as there are a lot of downsides to starting a company.<p>I found myself at the age of 30 many years into a company I started at 23, and it consumed my entire 20's.  Every aspect of my life suffered.<p>Are people aware of the strange things stress can do to one's body?  Look up 'IBS' in google.  Try not eating for a year.  That's just the stuff I can post.<p>I missed weddings and funerals.  I did things I'm so extremely proud of, and things I'm ashamed of.<p>Here is the real rub:  Once you hire employees, you have an obligation to give them a consistent paycheck.  It just happens.  This increases 10x when the employees aren't kids in their early twenties working for stock options making peanuts who get 10 job offers a week.<p>When you have employees who have families that depend on your company, depend on your health plan, your dental plan, your 401k matching funds, the pressure to maintain even when times are tough is huge.<p>The game can change quickly.  Having employees will make it harder to throw up your arms when things get tough and say 'perhaps I don't have a winner here'.  You will dig in, and continue the battle, and you are committed until it can survive on it's own.  And sometimes that takes a couple years.<p>Or five.<p>Or ten.<p>So a word of caution.  Keeping a company alive is tough.  Closing down a company is tougher.  A fairy tale ending is a pipe dream.  Last time I checked, there are a very small number of Mark Cuban's, and this sure ain't 1998.  And guess what Jerry Yang is doing: working his ass off to save the soul of his baby.  His hugely successful baby.<p>He doesn't have to be there.<p>He made his billions.  But things aren't right, and he can't sleep at night.<p>Success is  hitting payroll every month.  Never ever miss payroll.  Any goodness above that is gravy.  Anything worse than that is hell.<p>Would I change it all, and to have just gotten a job out of college, reporting to someone every day of my life?  Hell no!!  I love it.  I could think of no better way to live my life. :)",1205978538

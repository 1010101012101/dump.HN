At the time, this was thought of as a way to ""correct"" the issue just as various drugs we force on kids is now.  Personally I find it at least as bad that these drugs are forced on kids who have no way to defend themselves or even know what's being done to them.<p>The last time I was in the US I ended up having lunch with a friend and that friend's grown up daughter.  The daughter, sadly, had a 4 year old son.  During the coarse of lunch the loud, obnoxious daughter explained about all the disorders her kid had (ADD, OCD, etc.) and all the <i>drugs</i> she gave him to deal with it.  My wife asked what would happen if she just skipped giving him all this medication.  ""Oh, you just can't deal with him if he's not on it."".<p>She then went on to talk about her life.  It was pretty clear that she had no time for the kid; he had to either be with baby sitters or sitting in front of the TV nearly 24/7.  I can't help but think/hope that in 50 years this kind of lazy, inconsiderate behavior will be considered criminal (since it's the child who bears the long term affects of it, not the decision maker).  That kid sounded like a normal 4 year old boy to me but he's being drugged into shape so he can serve a role closer to that of a cat than of a child.<p>It's been speculated that if Mozart, Beethoven, etc. were born in the US today they would probably never amount to anything because their parents would probably drug away their creativity.",1301992976

2410176,comment,2406920,2408427,2,0,mattbillenstein,,,"Threads for python webapps are fine, but they break down when doing things like chat (using long polling or websockets) where you have a lot of open mostly idle connections.  Coroutines and libraries like gevent and eventlet let you elegantly use greenlets without contorting your code -- ie, you get async without callbacks or deferreds -- and you have the benefit of being able to handle thousands of connections in a single python process.  Of course you don't get processor concurrency, but you don't really get that with straight CPython because of the GIL anyway -- and if you're deploying a largish web app, you're going to have a load balancer (haproxy ftw) and you can just run one process per core anyway.  This also mostly transparently lets you scale out to N boxes with M cores per box with very little architecture changes at the inbound request to web-server level.<p>Which brings me to the microprocess / shared module ideas -- RAM is pretty cheap -- 1GB or 2GB per core isn't anything fancy, and if you're using more than a couple gig in a python webapp process, something is probably wrong.  As far as sharing state between microprocesses, I don't see how that really solves anything -- you're going to have processes on different boxes if you have any sort of traffic or fault tolerance and you're going to be putting that shared state into a cache or database somewhere anyway.<p>Raw compute speed is important to the scipy/numpy crowds, so I think things like Cython and PyPy make a lot of sense there -- webapps are I/O bound, so you spend 90% or more of the time it takes to service a request waiting, which async is really good at. PyPy isn't going to beat CPython by 20x on some django benchmark, but they will on some compute-intensive ones.<p>So anyway, I think my point is, you can have your cake and eat it too -- coroutines without pain (gevent) and processor-level concurrency (load balancer) for web applications using off the shelf production-ready technology on commodity hardware...",1301992800

I'm currently a senior at a liberal arts school, majoring in CS. Of the 10 or so CS majors in my class, I'd say half are also ""hackers"" in that they spend significant free time programming outside of class, for work and for fun. All of these people know at least one of {Ruby,Javascript} (Ruby happens to be less popular around here than Python since the latter is taught in intro classes). Not coincidentally, these people are also at the top of the department and are having the most success  applying to grad school AND jobs.<p>I guess my point is that the hacker/academic distinction is not necessarily as broad as one would think reading some of these comments, and that many of us CS types think of ourselves as hackers as well as academics.",1301991711

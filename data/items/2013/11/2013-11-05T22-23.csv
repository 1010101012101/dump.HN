I think it&#x27;s largely PR parroting, and a way to seem marginally &#x27;with it&#x27; re: linux.  &quot;hey yeah, I know ubuntu had some issues in the past, but you should really try it now - it&#x27;s a lot better!&quot; - just got 2 emails from people in the last week or so asking why I use OSX.<p>I was a desktop/laptop linux user from 2000-2008.  That&#x27;s about 9 years of &quot;oh hey - things are so much better this year&quot;.  And yet... in 2008 I still had issues trying to have multiple apps access audio at the same time.  I still had issues plugging in an external monitor on a laptop (or 2 monitors on a desktop).  I grew tired of rickety perlgtk scripts that were marginal wrappers around Xorg config files that never quite ever worked the way I could interpret the man page info.  I&#x27;ve used desktop ubuntu distros virtualbox and vmware over the past couple years - things don&#x27;t seem to have gotten that much better, mostly because the majority of the developers in those ecosystems don&#x27;t see these things as massive problems to be solved in the first place (indeed, with some, it&#x27;s a badge of honor that things are still hard to configure).<p>Again, the point is &quot;hey, linux is better on the desktop now&quot;, in my experience, comes from people who&#x27;ve never really used it for a long time and had moderate expectations not met.  Many people I know that use desktop linux <i>expect</i> it to be subpar for many things, and when it&#x27;s just &#x27;par&#x27; they herald this as a big improvement.<p>That said, I really miss fish from KDE.",1383692246

I&#x27;m basically just dumping gut feelings here--don&#x27;t expect a lot of well-written explanations.<p><i>There is not a lot worth buying that is long-lasting.</i> Most everything feels mass-produced and cheap, and the things that aren&#x27;t are pretty obviously marketed at people trying to buck that trend. I don&#x27;t want to pay 10x more for something without getting that increase in quality, and the fact is that I won&#x27;t get it.<p><i>There is no reason to trust the banks.</i> They&#x27;re a bunch of fucking crooks, and the smaller the bank (or credit union) the less room they have to be crooks.<p><i>Credit rating is bogeyman.</i> Ever since I was old enough to spend money I was told to worry about my credit rating, and to take out credit cards, and do all that other stuff. These messages occurred at about the same time we saw everyone getting hammered over credit-card debt, and heard the Republicans chest-beating over sound fiscal policy. It&#x27;s plainly obvious that you aren&#x27;t expected to actually be fiscally sound--otherwise why would they keep flooding you with credit invitations?<p><i>Cars are expensive and limited in utility.</i> Insurance rates are high despite companies never actually helping you when you need it, gas is expensive as hell and is clearly being gamed in the commodities market, and commuting is bullshit as white-collar work becomes either redundant or distributed.<p><i>Our parents set our city planning up for failure.</i> I live in the fourth-largest and sprawliest metropolitan area in North America (Houston). Every decent improvement is blocked by some greedy Boomer sonovabitch whose business or view would be mildly inconvenienced by the impact of construction. We have food deserts, and suburbs actively designed to discourage walking.<p><i>Our government doesn&#x27;t care about us.</i> Nobody in my generation believes that Social Security or Mediwhatever will still be around to support us in our old age. Nobody believes that our vote matters, that the politicians sitting in office will kowtow to anybody who won&#x27;t pay for a fucking dinner or make a fucking donation.<p><i>Our government not only doesn&#x27;t care about us, it schemes to make things worse.</i> Because the Boomers and Generation X are still considered important, their views and more importantly fears are turned into policy. This gives us the TSA, crazy FDA regs, patent trolling, and all sorts of barriers to progress.<p><i>Our companies don&#x27;t care about us.</i> Congratulations, we&#x27;re all contract workers now. Pensions? Hah. Healthcare? Cheapest we can justify. Vacation? Go fuck yourself you needy snowflake. No loyalty, nada, and they expect that they can reach you on the phone or email at all times.<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in advertising.</i> We&#x27;ve had so much marketed to us for so long so pervasively that we genuinely do not respond to advertising. It&#x27;s a developed blind spot, and with the social tools we have available we see no need to be advertised to--we know what we want, and can just search for it.<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in the police.</i> Police are pretty obviously not policing neighborhoods and aren&#x27;t on the beat--they&#x27;re chaotic actors who get involved and always always always make things worse. The news is filled with stories of DAs fucking over little guys, of state troopers harassing innocent drivers to raise a buck, of SWAT teams kicking in homes and shooting dogs.<p><i>We don&#x27;t believe in the news.</i> It&#x27;s become easier than ever to find different coverage on the same stories, and to spot patterns in news-speak. Every talking head sounds the same, and the news is always obviously slanted to one side or the other. There is no journalistic integrity anymore, there is nothing in the mainstream news we can trust.<p><i>We believe in each other.</i> The sheer amount of fakeness delivered through ads and bullshit mass media has made us very interested in &quot;real&quot; things, in hanging out with our friends, in starting families.

For single teams based on small projects the ability to up and move all your tools (IDEs, build train, library dependencies) really isn&#x27;t a problem; but if you&#x27;re dealing with hundreds or thousands of users and tens of thousands of libraries, you simply can&#x27;t do an all-in-one upgrade.<p>And no, 2.10.x and 2.10.y being compatible isn&#x27;t something to crow about; it should have been the default. The fact that you can&#x27;t compile or test code in Eclipse with the Typesafe developed Scala IDE plugin for anything other than that exact version is one reason why developers are moving to IntelliJ&#x27;s Scala development tools.<p>Ironically the problem is that the Scala IDE is written in Scala, whereas the IntelliJ tool is written in Kotlin, and Kotlin doesn&#x27;t have compatibility problems (plus, it shells out to the specific compiler instead of Eclipse&#x27;s Scala tools which embed their own).<p>Yes, teams at the Guardian are using Scala - but only in teams of less than ten people, and where they don&#x27;t need to share libraries across multiple users and clients. That still doesn&#x27;t make it enterprise ready.<p>Sadly I feel that Rod Johnson&#x27;s keynote presentation at ScalaDays - which pointed out the same things as this post, and was the trigger - is being ignored. Unfortunately Typesafe are also ignoring this advice, and until that changes we won&#x27;t see Scala being adopted in large enterprises.<p>Scala had a chance back in the late 2000s to be the next Java.

A lot of what we do starts as grassroots efforts. Honestly, getting 10,000 engineers to act in a coordinated fashion is probably like trying to herd 10,000 cats.<p>AngularJS started as a side project that became Google-sponsored and it grew organically. Being Google-sponsored simply means some team somewhere has dedicated some engineers to working on it. That&#x27;s it.<p>Likewise a group of engineers separately started Dart due to  dissatisfaction with JavaScript being the lingua franca of the Web. The idea was that Dart can be implemented as a VM within a browser and get faster performance that way. Likewise, it should compile to JavaScript for browsers that don&#x27;t support Dart in the browser (which is all of them except Chrome). Also, Dart shares a lot of the philosophies of GWT in sharing code between client and server.<p>Now my personal view is that I honestly don&#x27;t see the point of Dart. I mean no disrespect to the team or their efforts but I don&#x27;t agree with the premise or the design philosophy of Dart.<p>Optional typing seems to me to combine the worst of both worlds. If typing is useful (as the static typers will argue) then be statically typed. If it&#x27;s not be dynamically typed. Dart&#x27;s type system is basically just the Closure JsDoc system used by the Closure compiler. That&#x27;s it. To me, there&#x27;s no real innovation there.<p>Dart is really just another Coffeescript and I don&#x27;t see the point of Coffeescript either.<p>One of the benefits of development in JavaScript is you can simply refresh your browser and it just works. I&#x27;m a huge fan of this fast iteration cycle in development. It&#x27;s the same reason I&#x27;m a fan of Python, Ruby and even PHP.<p>Additionally, as soon as you add a translation step from something to JavaScript, you introduce potential bugs in that translation (eg I&#x27;ve seen bugs with the Closure compiler incorrectly removed code it thought was dead and that was JS to JS let alone the issues with, say, GWT&#x27;s Java to JS). Even if there aren&#x27;t bugs, tracing issues back to the source becomes more difficult.<p>Rob Pike through Go seems to believe this too (not that I claim to speak for him) because he&#x27;s repeatedly mentioned that the simple syntax of Go and fast compilation is a deliberate feature, a philosophy I agree with 100%. It&#x27;s also one reason I detest C++: slow compilation kills productivity (IMHO).<p>So AngularDart is nothing more than another group of engineers (perhaps there&#x27;s a crossover with the Dart folks) wants a modern Web framework for client-side Dart so they created one.<p>The idea that this is part of some grand strategy is quite frankly ludicrous.<p>Google puts their effort behind a lot of experimental projects. Some work out, many don&#x27;t. Will Dart succeed? I don&#x27;t presume to know. But while I don&#x27;t agree with the premise/philosophy it makes me happy that the company I work for is still prepared to experiment with such efforts and devote resources to them.<p>If you work at Google you&#x27;ll often see three teams working on roughly the same thing, typically without knowing about the existence of the others. They may consolidate or compete (if they have incompatible philosophies that the teams feel strongly about) or something in between.<p>This happens because so many efforts just start out as a single engineer or a small group of engineers just trying something out or they want to solve a problem they see (and in an organization this large it&#x27;s rare you&#x27;re the only one who sees a particular problem and wants to do something about it).<p>So, please, can we discuss this on its merits rather than the new norm of seeing vast conspiracies or simply seeing things as some collusion with the NSA. It&#x27;s really tiresome.<p>EDIT: added a paragraph about the issues of bugs and translating something to javaScript.",1383691118

There, there are both national competitions where consistently beating weaker teams is the way to win and national knock out tournaments where one has to beat the best team to win.<p>And yes, knock out tournaments are more likely to have the weaker team win, but that can make them more attractive, as determining the strongest player may take a long time (for an example, see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1984"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Chess_Championship_1984</a>)<p>IMO, the &#x27;only&#x27; problem with the chess world championship is that the organization is a shambles.

While many companies set absolute caps on maximum value that a given position can bring, a person filling that position will likely be tens of thousands of dollars below that cap when they&#x27;re hired. What that means is that there&#x27;s a ton of wiggle room for both the applicant and the company to negotiate salary.<p>When you list out a salary without giving any thought as to the applicant, I would imagine that you&#x27;d a lot of resumes from people who treat job searches like college applications (reach, backup, safety), while also weeding out potential winners with an arbitrary value on the job listing that could easily fluctuate to accommodate people who fit great with the company but need more than market compensation to sign on.<p>That said, I think that a company should be up front about how much they were looking to spend on a new hire when asked.

The JVM has very well defined entry and exit points to deal with this. The problem seems to stem more with the libraries. As long as the libraries keep changing at a fast rate, the scala cmomunity will never achieve backwards compatibility at the level this author wants to achieve.

I disagree that &quot;nothing&quot; has happened since 2.8 to improve Scala&#x27;s enterprise readiness (the Scala team at Typesafe does just that).<p>Binary compatibility is one (desirable) way of making upgrades smoother (but certainly no panacea).
We haven&#x27;t reached the point yet where we&#x27;re willing to freeze the whole library across major releases, but we&#x27;re working towards this.
In Scala 2.11.x, we&#x27;ve slimmed down the library (by deprecating more aggressively and modularizing),
so as to reduce the core to something that we&#x27;re comfortable enforcing binary compatibility for.<p>In the mean time, we&#x27;re working on mitigating the upgrade pain with tooling and &quot;community outreach&quot;.
We&#x27;re working with the developers of core Scala projects to assist them in cross-building their projects,
and we&#x27;re investing in tooling to automate this. With every 2.11 milestone we&#x27;re working to get the eco-system
in shape for the final 2.11.0 release, so that your dependencies will be available when you upgrade.<p>We&#x27;re also working on gaining engineering experience in enforcing full backwards and forwards binary compatible,
albeit only between minor releases of Scala 2.10.x (enforced with <a href=""https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/typesafehub/migration-manager</a>).
This means code compiled against Scala 2.10.x is guaranteed to run on a Scala 2.10.y run time

Maybe it is time to check out xcfe again, or more likely, tweak my gnome config further to disable that menu placement as well.  I&#x27;m attached to gnome, I think, because it does things like powering down external drives via the &quot;file manager&quot;, (whatever thats called now), which xcfe didn&#x27;t do when I tried it last year.",1383689818

Large IT departments working on multi-MLOC codebases need a solid, clear language. Scala was promising back when it was meant to be &quot;a better Java&quot;. And you know why people liked it? Mostly because it had lambdas and traits - two features that are in Java 8.<p>Since then, Scala has become a sort of a testbed for new ideas in compiler technology. Consider this  it&#x27;s basically got three complete type systems: an OO, inheritance based type system, a Haskell-like algebraic type system (sealed traits and case classes), and a duck-typed type system (structural types). Each of these type systems has been enough to write good, complex software, on each own. Scala&#x27;s got all three, while at the same time missing on all of their advantages. It doesn&#x27;t have Haskell&#x27;s type safety and purity (or type inference). It doesn&#x27;t have OO&#x27;s simple, highly extensible, and just-powerful-enough type system, because it&#x27;s so big and complicated, and it doesn&#x27;t have duck-typing&#x27;s care-freedom, because it&#x27;s so heavy. Oh, and it&#x27;s got macros, too, just for the heck of it.<p>I know some people like it because they have fun writing lisp, Haskell, Java and JavaScript in the same file and have it compiled by just one compiler. Yeah, it&#x27;s a cool compiler. But seriously, it doesn&#x27;t offer anything enterprise would want. It doesn&#x27;t offer safety; it doesn&#x27;t offer simplicity; it doesn&#x27;t offer familiarity. It doesn&#x27;t even offer much compatibility: it&#x27;s much harder to integrate Java with Scala than with Clojure or Groovy, let alone Kotlin.<p>And I&#x27;m willing to bet that almost all large companies that currently employ Scala, do it because of its original promise of being a better Java. But if you&#x27;re a superset of about 4 language families, than you clearly can&#x27;t a better Java.<p>For those who want that productivity boost while maintaining familiarity and compatibility, there&#x27;s Kotlin. And Java 8, of course.",1383689158

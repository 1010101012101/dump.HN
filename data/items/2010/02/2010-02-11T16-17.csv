In the US the concept of an educated citizenry was a core principle of the founders -- when you divest power to the masses you want them to be relatively smart about what they do with it.  Public education predates the industrial revolution and while industrialists may have wanted a better-educated workforce that was not why public education was established.  If a ""pliable"" workforce was desired then simple apprenticeship after basic literacy would have worked fine.  Mass education gives a country more engineers, but is not required for simple factory work.

1117949,comment,1117668,1117899,0,0,apsec112,,,"Actually, I pretty strongly think that there is a limit on the number of startups, if by ""startup"" you mean ""small company in which people create wealth largely through computer programming"".<p>According to the BLS, there are 1.3 million ""software engineers"" and programmers in the United States (cite: <a href=""http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos303.htm</a>). This number will go up over the next fifty years, but not by that much; projected growth is 2% annually. One could see this number increasing more rapidly if programmers are in so much demand that their salaries (either in the form of cash or startup equity) go up very fast, but we don't see that happening; programmers nowadays don't get paid that much more, in either dollars or equity, than programmers five or ten years ago.<p>Now, how many of these programmers have the skills needed to start a successful company? Let's be optimistic and say 10%, which is probably above your estimate (""The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software"", cite: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>).<p>Now, out of those, how many have the personality and determination needed to start a successful company? In the overall population this number is probably less than 5%, but the traits needed to become a good programmer (high energy, determination, ability to think well) probably correlate significantly with the traits needed to start a successful company, so I'll be optimistic again and say 25%.<p>Now, what's the viable window for programmers to start companies? At a guess, I'd say probably around age 22-37, so 15 years. I'm going to be optimistic again and assume that all working programmers are within this age range.<p>Now, how many founder-class programmers do you need to start a successful company? This number could probably range from one to five, but I'm going to be optimistic again and say one.<p>So, dividing it out, the number of successful startups every year is bounded above by 1,300,000 * 0.1 * 0.25 / 15 = ~2,200, and this is almost certainly an overestimate.",1265905973

1117891,comment,1117691,1117808,0,0,bbb,,,"This is not a ""black and white"" issue with one true answer.  You have to see this in the historic context.<p>One of the reasons why the first German democracy (1918-1933) failed (and gave rise to Hitler) is because the German society was very much compartmentalized and split into ""subcultures"" at the time. In fact, large parts of the military chose to continue as ""para-military"" units after the end of WWI. These violent groups that saw themselves as above the law played a significant part in Hitler's ascent to power.<p>When the current Germany was designed after WWII, many safeguards were built into the system to ensure that there would be no more ""parallel"" societies. Two obvious examples are 1) the universal draft (flow all parts of society through the military to prevent the military from isolating itself) and 2) no home schooling (the public schools serve to promote democracy and western values; the public school system is designed to be the ""melting pot"" that integrates immigrants and fringe groups).<p>How would you feel about this case if the home schooling did not involve Christians (Note: I'm not religious myself.), but radical Moslems? What if it were about Nazis indoctrinating their kids with hate? What if it were about a sect that raises their kids to prepare for a collective suicide?<p>The German (mainstream) belief is that the government has to step in in these cases. It has to protect the kids from their own parents.<p>The family that was granted asylum may very well be fine parents and teachers (I don't know them), but for obvious reasons you can't have an effective law that says ""you may only homeschool kids for Christian reasons, but other choices are not ok"".<p>So, the German society, under consideration of its history, chooses to err on the safe side: no homeschooling. Period.<p>Of course, the particular circumstances may very much differ for other societies, so that other societies may reasonably come up with different rules (e.g., the US). But that does not invalidate the reasoning behind the German laws.",1265904479

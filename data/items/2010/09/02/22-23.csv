1658032,comment,1657399,1657766,0,0,NateLawson,,,"There are a number of things you can do:<p>1. Legal: pursue copyright violators, possible DMCA claims against those who circumvent your protection scheme (if you have one)<p>2. Technical: build in DRM. If not, at least add forensic marking to allow you to track the source of your piracy to know if it's hurting actual sales or not<p>3. Social: stop propagating the meme that copying commercial data is ok because you are knowledgable enough to do so and it doesn't hurt anyone.<p>The RIAA has an uphill battle because of no option #2. (CDs have no DRM, despite efforts to retrofit it). They are trying #1 and #3.<p>Also, I have a counter-example to Felten's claims that DRM never prevented piracy. With BD+ (Blu-ray), we have had some discs survive 60 days before they were cracked. In that time period, there were no high-def rips available on Bittorrent of those movies.<p>While there are still no large studies showing how many potential pirates purchased a disc due to the delay in availability, I wholeheartedly disagree with ""There's nothing I can do about piracy"".",1283468306

It doesn't make your bank worth less than Juanito the beet farmer in Brazil.<p>Thank you for proving my point.  Without Juanito the beet farmer, and the stereotypical mid-western farmer or Texan oil-man being efficient and extracting a profit from their activities, there is no surplus.  Without the beets (and wheat,and beef, etc) none of us get fed.  Without piles of invested long-term capital from capital markets you don't have trans-ocean cables, and without that you don't have any way of talking from Bangalore to Idaho. Without the mines to dig up the minerals you don't have planes, and without oil wells you don't have fuel, without pilots and baggage handlers you don't get to go to Bangalore.  So you wouldn't need your bankcard.<p>The whole reason we can actually get to Bangalore to use our bank card is because those in primary production do it efficiently enough that not all of us are involved in doing it.  That's the surplus production (and thus, wealth) that allows us to do these things.<p>Look, I'm not anti-tech in the slightest - this is how I make my living.  I'm just imploring tech people not to lose touch with that the industry really is, not to let your fee lose touch with the ground and the real economy that we're all here to support and improve.",1283468290

As far as I know, God ceased to mess with our world a long, long time ago. And if God created the universe, what created God?<p>So we're left with either the universe that explain itself (it just is), or a God that explain itself, and created the universe (and then left it alone). God is a bit like the Dragon in my Garage: everything happens as if it wasn't there.<p>So, my preference simply goes to the simplest explanation: that there is no God.  I don't expect you to have the same preference.  But I do expect you to either acknowledge that there is no difference, or to eventually identify those differences.<p>So, do you think there is a difference between ""God exists"" and ""God does not exist""?  Do you think his (non) existence would change your life?  Do you think  you would observe different things in either case? <i>This</i> is the question I think everyone on this planet should think about for 5 minutes.  Once you answered it, you basically have defined your God, whose existence is now either refutable or unimportant.  In one case, science will likely find out (eventually), and on the other, well, I don't care what one believes.",1283468156

1658013,comment,1657574,1657574,0,0,jamwt,,,"My answer, as someone who recently switched an AMQP backend to using redis for queues and pub/sub broadcast: AMQP is wrong the same way RDBMSes or Java are ""wrong.""  It's too heavy, too slow, or too complex for a great-many use cases.<p>There's a long tradition that seems to be (mercifully) fading of ornately engineered solutions being developed for the most demanding of problem domains, and then subsequently being universally adopted for projects large and small because if ""it's good enough for the enterprise, it's good enough for me"".  It's a variation of the ""nobody ever got fired..."" mentality.<p>The truth is that something with a radically reduced feature set, that's simpler to use and understand, is really all that's needed to meet a whole lot of ""real world"" use cases.<p>Read the AMQP-0.8 spec sometime.  It's rather complex given that a _huge_ percentage of users just want a set of features something like:<p>1. A namespace to name queues\n 2. The ability to put things on and pull things off in FIFO order\n 3. The ability to persist those things on daemon start/stop (maybe)\n 4. Pub/sub style broadcast behavior with lossy messaging (maybe)<p>So redis, as an example: antirez (half-accidentally) got a lot of attention from weary queueing-system wanderers by implementing a majority of these capabilities with just a few redis commands--(l,r)push and (l,r)pop.  Redis was so close to a simple, but full replacement for what they actually do with ActiveMQ, Rabbit, etc, that they begged for B(L,R)POP on many keys and PUB/SUB.  And that pretty much covers it.<p>Of course, redis is just one of a number of other project/protocols are stealing attention from AMQP systems, like ZeroMQ, beanstalkd, etc.<p>But the larger trend is like Linux::""UNIX"", Ruby::Java, MongoDB::Postgres, etc.  Despite the hell-and-damnation warnings often bandied about by the enterprisey experts, you really can build a wide array of very useful things using these ""toy"" tools.",1283467956

1657944,comment,1657740,1657740,0,0,tumult,,,"The author of this article makes some naïve assumptions about modern auto-tune systems, including but not limited to Antares Auto-Tune. His primary mistaken assumption is that an auto-tune system will snap a note perfectly into alignment with an ideal pitch. This is not true. A sophisticated automated system (like Antares Auto-Tune, in typical usage, not for the Cher effect) uses heuristics to find a more natural, imperfect pitch to use as an alignment.<p>And this is just for ""fire and forget"" auto-tune. If you work an auto-tune by hand – and most skilled engineers will do this, when it's called for – you can use your own judgment as a musician to figure out what to do. Antares Auto-Tune lets you do this by presenting a sort of X-Y plot of pitch over time which you can manipulate. Melodyne does something similar, with a little more sophistication (it actually pioneered this technique.)<p>Another one of his incorrect assumptions is that auto-tune still behaves like that patent from 1998. While some of the algorithms involved are the same, the systems of today [1] use lookahead on the audio source, so that the pitch correction isn't constantly playing 'catchup' (it takes at least a coupe of cycles of an oscillating wave to determine its pitch with reasonable accuracy.) So you would not see something start wrong and then deviate towards its ideal pitch – in fact, you might see it start <i>too</i> accurately.<p>The primary destruction auto-tune wreaks on vocal performances isn't just too-perfect pitch: it destroys the subtly and intonation that good performers can impart. A real vocalist doesn't hit the ideal pitch at the start of each note, because it's hard to make the human voice do that. They use the imperfection to their advantage. There's a lot of subtle complexity that auto-tune can just wipe out when you use it.<p>Of course, if the vocalist isn't that good, then there's not any real loss.<p>As for his article, even assuming the methods he used to analyze the songs were not based on a misconception, the resolution is too low. Perhaps surprisingly, the human ear is capable of distinguishing pitch much more finely than the graphs he plotted.<p>Edited addendum: here are a couple of screenshots of the actual Antares Auto-Tune software that will illustrate what I'm talking about.<p>Here is a picture of the Auto-Tune software set in fire-and-forget 'auto' mode. <a href=""http://www.antarestech.com/images/ATEvo_Auto_mode.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.antarestech.com/images/ATEvo_Auto_mode.jpg</a><p>Notice the prominent 'Retune Speed' adjustment knob.

I am happy to engage in fair discussions of the tradeoffs between real schools and real homeschooling.

In a blog post last month, they noted: ""before being posted each individual ad is reviewed by an attorney licensed to practice law in the US, trained to enforce craigslist’s posting guidelines, which are stricter than those typically used by yellow pages, newspapers, or any other company that we are aware of. More than 700,000 ads were rejected by those attorneys in the year following implementation of manual screening, for falling short of our guidelines.""<p><a href=""http://blog.craigslist.org/2010/08/manual-screening-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.craigslist.org/2010/08/manual-screening-matters/</a><p>Craigslist also does other stuff, including phone verification for every adult services ad: <a href=""http://blog.craigslist.org/2010/05/an-open-invitation-to-rachel-lloyd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.craigslist.org/2010/05/an-open-invitation-to-rac...</a><p>As Craigslist notes, this is a lot more screening than any other services does, including classifieds or the Yellow Pages.",1283464820

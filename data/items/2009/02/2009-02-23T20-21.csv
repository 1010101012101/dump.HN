Checking on the twitter stream shows that there's a lot of RT of this headline - which will only serve to spread TC's name around. It may be bad in the long run, but they may be able to issue some muted apology, patch things up, and restore their standing. More coverage, etc.<p>Of course, with MA's combative personality, it may go slightly differently, but it's probably a net positive for TC. Sadly enough.",1235422726

492204,comment,490173,490620,0,0,ewiethoff,,,"Speaking of skill level, it occurred to me last year to offer to be ""roving guru"" (sounds haughty) or ""roving consultant"" or simply ""Rover"" (woof!) when we have an odd number of developers. This works out nicely for <i>me</i> anyway, and the others are fine with it. I have no idea what this does to our velocity because we are, unfortunately, very disorganized and don't keep track. (I shan't bother to explicate.) I do enjoy teaching and mentoring people, as long as that's the real plan. And the roving helps me tolerate the noise level in an open workspace. Maybe because I have to <i>pay attention</i> to all the vocal noise. I have to keep alert to the sound of people calling for assistance or sounding lost and confused.<p>OMG, I just got an insight. I'm an effective Rover or mentoring ""navigator"" <i>as long as no one expects me to read</i>. I need to <i>not</i> look at the monitor, <i>not</i> try to read the code or docs or whatever. As long as all I do in the presence of talking people is do my own listening and talking, my brain doesn't turn to complete mush. I noticed long ago that I have almost zero reading comprehension when I read English (native language) aloud. I also remember covering my ears while reading silently when someone else reads or the teacher is talking. Etc. So the big insight is, my reading incomprehension in the presence of speech extends to reading computer code! I have a reading problem (or attention problem, or whatever it boils down to) which frustrates my ability to pair.<p>That explains why I have such a hard time understanding even a single line of code in most pairing sessions. That explains why, when I'm the ""extra set of eyes,"" all I'm good for is syntax and spelling check (which really should be done by software, not me). Writing code happens to be a lot more of reading what's on the monitor than head's down typing. So, the question is, how am I able to drive okay with insightful and not-so-obtrusive Apoorva? Well, it often doesn't work. But I notice it does work when there's only one other pair in the room and I haul Apoorva and me to the far end. That cuts the other voices down significantly.<p>Thank you, thank you for prompting me to think this through.",1235422306

Your first paragraph is entirely about you, that's patently obvious, so my question is why are you so fundamentally afraid of getting married and failing? You're on a site about start ups, hello more businesses than marriages fail and you can lose a lot more through bankruptcy than you can through alimony. Oh and guess what, there's prenups.<p>I'm married and I've never been happier. Since getting married I go out more, spend more time with friends and in fact have a lot more sex than I ever did before I met my wife. Do you even know if your married friends are actually miserable, or is that your assumption from the outside? Do you even <i>know</i> their spouse? Have you ever even spent time out with them when they're out with other married couples? You simply state they're miserable, with quite dramatic emphasis but not even a single piece of anecdotal evidence to back it up. Your comments are entirely clichéd and stereotyped.<p>Honestly, when I see a bitchy wife I <i>also</i> see a very spineless, ball-less husband. Also for the few wives that gain 'mega' weight, I also see far more husbands who are fat lazy pigs.<p>Oh and I am from Europe, if American males have problems with American females, they're going to be fucking dominated by European women. The divorce rate is lower in europe, only because it's socially unacceptable and in Italy your wife has the legal right to lie to police to protect an affair! I mean sure, marry a nice Italian girl, they're basically raised that if they're not getting it at home it's okay to get it somewhere else, so yeah don't worry you wont get divorced, but <i>you</i> certainly won't be the one having sex in that marriage either!<p><i>Please</i> don't spout BS about Europe unless you actually know the cultures. Every European country has either a near 50% divorce rate, or you simply will not get divorced because your family and friends would cast you out. Losing 'everything' isn't the risk of losing 50% of your monetary value or income, losing everything is when you lose 50% of your money, your family, your friends and every person hence forth who you meet will judge you because you're divorced.",1235421671

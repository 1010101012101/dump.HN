The Internet has a history of overreactive paranoia when it comes to change.<p>Example #1: I remember a huge privacy backlash when the first social networking site opened.  It was a combination of Facebook and Linkedin, yet it was <i>more</i> private than either of them. People were absolutely livid about the privacy implications.  This site, Six Degrees, opened in 1998-fifteen years ago, and shutdown soon thereafter.  However, over time, the boogeyman many feared never materialized, and people became more open about sharing online.<p>Example #2: Later, when the DMCA was proposed, it was claimed that it would be the death of the Internet.  The DMCA has been law for more than a decade, and the Internet still lives.<p>So, based on past examples, I predict that people will stop caring about NSA-type programs when no harm ends up coming to them from wholesale data screening on the part of the government.

Sperm counts aren&#x27;t the only factors in reproduction but rather environment variables also play an important part in the process.

(One could actually turn this into an untaxed wage increase by buying the 6 month pass at the standard discount, rather than six 1 month passes, and pocketing the 6th month&#x27;s subsidy.  Eventually HR realized this, cut the subsidy, and directed everyone to buy the 6 month pass.  HR was surprised that this decision was unpopular.)<p>One of the reasons for subsidizing commute expenses in Japan is that they&#x27;re typically both high relative to employee salaries and the benefits are not taxable as earned income, whereas giving equivalent sums of money for other purposes does make that money taxable.

Other then an email service, for the life of me, I can&#x27;t put my finger on what they do. Crawl around the web and put a yahoo sticker on anything they think is cool?<p>Now however, maybe their brand can start to represent something I care about, but they&#x27;ll have to actually do some useful things too.<p>And then there&#x27;s this: <a href=""http://theoatmeal.com/comics/email_address"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/email_address</a>",1374037526

They do a lot of intelligence collection.<p>I&#x27;m disturbed by Snowden&#x27;s grandiosity in those statements. He fits the personality type interrogators would call a &quot;grand egoist.&quot; He exaggerates his individual importance and skills to the point of self-delusion.<p>Ironically, this package of traits is often found in people of extraordinary skill. He has managed to abscond from the country with thousands of our deepest secrets, and prevent his own capture amidst the biggest manhunt in the history of the world.<p>But at the same time, he seems to be losing his grip under the pressure. There simply is no way that an individual can guarantee he or she won&#x27;t give away information under threat of torture or under the manipulation of interrogation. The secrets live in his head, and the operating system that runs on our grey matter is eminently hackable.<p>Deeply, deeply disturbing rhetoric.",1374037463

The way I write code i typically simply do opening parens and at the end just jam parens until the rainbow-delimiters start to show up unbalanced (red in my case). If I need to pay attention because I&#x27;m not at the end of a top level form, I quickly glance to see which matched parens are flashing as I add each delimiter.",1374037441

Up to 50% worse in fact on Windows Chrome 28.<p>Interestingly, just defining initializeSomethingElse within Cell only results in ~10% slowdown, and that yields a truly private method.  E.g.<p><pre><code>    function Cell(x, y) {
      var self = this;
      self.x = x;
      self.y = y;
      self.things = [1, 2, 3];

      // private -unreachable- method
      initializeSomethingElse();

      // Private methods here
      function initializeSomethingElse() {
        self.dir = Math.atan2(self.y, self.x);
        self.total = 0;
        self.things.forEach(function(thing) {
          self.total += thing;

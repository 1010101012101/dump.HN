There&#x27;s a bunch of books that seem to be of that tone (Learn you a Haskell, Land of Lisp, Realm of Racket, Learn You Some Erlang), and I found myself instinctively recoiling from all of them (I haven&#x27;t read the Erlang book, but it seems very much in that style).<p>I think it&#x27;s important to have lots of different styles of books for learning a language, because I think different people respond better to different approaches, but selfishly, I wish every language had an equivalent to &quot;ANSI Common Lisp&quot; (by this site&#x27;s benefactor emeritus) and Real World Haskell.

I won&#x27;t spend any time on it in this comment since there are plenty of resources on the web for that, but that&#x27;s really been the important thing about REST for me. It really is a wonderful thing that clients cannot even attempt invalid state transitions, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve seen it done in any other even moderately popular RPC/IPC framework. In other frameworks/architectures for RPC/IPC all operations are just &quot;available&quot; all the time, but if you were to actually attempt to invoke them you&#x27;d get &quot;operation not supported&quot; (or the like).<p>Strangely, very few people (at least that I&#x27;ve spoken to) who are fans of REST seem to have even picked up on the HATEOAS principles. I&#x27;m guessing that their fandom is more predicated on a hatred of SOAP/XML and love of the simplicity of JSON -- which is kind of strange since HATEOAS also works beautifully for Content-type=XML over HTTP.<p>EDIT: An attempt to formalize the Richardson Maturity Model (L3) for REST+JSON/HTTP can be found at: <a href=""http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html</a> (I&#x27;m not affiliated with it in any way, just thought it was interesting.)",1405055059

Tech companies are dropping windows for the opposing systems because of speed, reliability, and the current trend in design.

Command-line tools generally have an option to control whether they dereference symlinks (cp -L, find -L, etc) rather than having a separate. parallel tool that does the same thing.

However so was Hal Finney (inventor of RPOW). They refer to it as the founder&#x27;s wallet, but I think it would be more appropriate to think of it as the wallet of an early miner.<p>* This early miner&#x27;s accumulated into it over 77,600 BTCs (mostly from mining operations)<p>* During June 2011 (4/6/2011 - 28/6/2011) almost all of these bitcoins were moved into a second account<p>* On the transaction graph, on one path, 45% of these bitcoins are are transferred to another wallet over the course of <i>late</i> 2012 to new year 2013. On the other path, the remaining 55% is sent to another wallet over the course of <i>early</i> 2012 to the same day new year 2013.<p>* The 45% wallet has a little of its funds sent to the 55% wallet, and then has laid dormant since a month back. In the 45% wallet in March&#x27;13, a fifth of the wallet is sent to the 55% wallet. Again, from the 14/9/13 to 23/10/13, another 15% is sent to the 55% wallet.<p>* However, if we look at the 55% wallet, we can see a clear link to DPR&#x27;s wallet. In March&#x27;13, the 55% wallet sends 6 transfers totalling 2.5% of its balance ($1000) to another wallet, which sends this to DPR&#x27;s account (as we know from the FBI&#x27;s discovery of the wallet).<p>The authors suggest that all of these accounts belonged to the same person, this same early miner they call the founder. This is a possible flaw in their argument, as there were multiple early miners, Hal Finney being one of them.<p>The transactions that divided this wallet into the 45% and 55% wallets could have also split the ownership.<p>Lastly, <i></i>it&#x27;s very important to understand<i></i> that while it may not be publicly recorded in the blockchain, these accounts could&#x27;ve changed hands by manually exchanging the private keys, and thus could bring into question the basis of this speculation.",1385372767

That sounds different than the Amazon one, but you cannot really do that in NL ; you can set a &#x27;realistic, sustainable minimum&#x27; amount of work they have to do, but that differs per person; you cannot fire or reprimand someone for not &#x27;making the beep&#x27; if that means you have to walk faster than normal or even run for it.

It&#x27;s particularly worth pointing out that this was/is an experiment even by Norwegian standard.<p>Norway&#x27;s prisons used to be horrible 100-150 years ago - we used to have prisons where people would be kept in iron and used for forced heavy manual labour, and kept in dark miserable cells. But it was clear that it didn&#x27;t really work. The system was getting miserable results whether you cared about reoffending rates, cost, human rights or whatever measure you might care about other than pure vengeance.<p>Rather than trying more of the same, which seems to be the common reaction, the criminal justice system has continuously been subject to experiments that has been focused on outcomes, and nearly every time, the experiments ends up evidence supporting a more and more lenient system whether you are looking at costs to society, reoffending rates or other factors.<p>Even satisfaction for victims is better served by reforms that focus on reconciliation than harsh punishment (people who consent to meet with victims or relatives of victims to explain themselves can in certain circumstances receive substantially reduced sentences).",1385372362

In particular, pilots are something that intuitively I feel like Netflix is going to have trouble speculating on at their size, whereas the networks and cable providers generally green-light a number of pilots per year. Netflix will need to hit on their productions (and have so far, to be sure, but they&#x27;re betting on the surest of things) and I have a feeling that in the short- and medium-term that&#x27;s going to result in what they&#x27;ve fielded so far: well-produced but not particularly innovative content with mostly established actors.

I was also on the Ripple mailing list back in the pre-OpenCoin days.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://freico.in/docs/freimarkets.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://freico.in/docs/freimarkets.pdf</a><p>>  To me, the main thing XRP adds to the concept is a way of bootstrapping the network by providing a way to bridge the gap between islands of nodes with no trust pathway for monetary value to flow between them<p>XRP adds nothing new to the bridging problem. Any other common currency could have been used, such as USD-backed assets or bitcoin. XRP was Jeb McCaleb&#x27;s stab at Bitcoin 2.0, and the bridging issue simply a post-facto rationalization. In a world where there is already existing decentralized currencies, or multiple legacy options for a common currency, there is no need for yet another centrally issued scarce-money... except that OpenCoin stands to materially benefit from forcing XRP down our throats.<p>> XRP also provides anti-DDOS...<p>It does so by economically limiting its own usefulness. Accounts and assets cost real money to create and maintain - more so than the fees involved with bitcoin. That brings us back to the traditional banking model of institutional asset issuers and heavyweight accounts, and rules out a number of protocols involving ephemeral asset issuance or privacy-enhancing one-time-use accounts.<p>I don&#x27;t consider the problem solved if the &quot;solution&quot; involves restrictions that unnecessarily limit the capability of the system.<p>> as well as a brilliant way to finance the creation, development, and maintenance of the network.<p>On this I could not disagree more. XRP is an unnatural, ill-fit hack on top of Ripple which provides no tangible benefit that could not be achieved by other less restrictive, and less obviously self-serving means. It therefore ads risk to anyone investing time or resources into using Ripple, as it may be surpassed by a superior fork which removes XRP.<p>Financing the creation of a new, distributed, peer-to-peer network is not easy, I know - it&#x27;s been hard trying to get funds for Freimarkets. But the OpenCoin / Mastercoin / Bitshares model is <i>not</i> the way to do it, in my opinion. Rather the bitcoin model is: distributed issuance and make your money from the economy that develops, not an underhanded wealth transfer written into the protocol.",1385370126

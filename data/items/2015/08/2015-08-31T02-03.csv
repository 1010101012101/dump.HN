Be warned that some psychiatrists are all too eager to write a prescription and send you on your way, when successful treatment hinges on a deeper understanding of the condition and the development of successful coping strategies once you&#x27;ve identified the negative behaviors.<p>Moreover, it&#x27;s worth noting that the author&#x27;s definition of ADHD and hyperfocus doesn&#x27;t actually match the medical definition of ADHD. Also, many of the ADHD websites list overly-broad ADHD criteria, such than almost any warm-blooded human could feasibly self-diagnose as having ADHD given the vagueness of the symptoms.<p>ADHD is, first and foremost, a deficit of attention abilities. It isn&#x27;t quite as selective as the author makes it out to be, in that someone with the traditional medical definition of ADHD would not be able to focus on anything for 16 hours straight as you are able to. In fact, being able to focus for such a long period of time is a truly enviable ability, and I doubt you&#x27;d find any competent medical professional who would suggest that you have ADHD if you are able to focus on your work for <i>twice</i> as long as the 8-hour workday that most people struggle through.<p>It&#x27;s important to note that we all miss appointments, we all prefer to do activities that interest us, we all occasionally stop listening to people mid-way through a conversation, and we all struggle to pay attention to boring jobs.

Since they are both run by the same web server instance, the slightest error in programming the user side will give the attacker admin privileges. Coding errors are inevitable. Therefore, on the long run, privilege escalation is inevitable as well.<p>The web server instance running the user application should never be in a position that it could acquire admin privileges. Therefore, you always need two web server instances. At the very least, the admin console should run on another port using another system user.<p>But even then, the user side code should not have unfettered access to the database. It must be locked down to the operations that are permissible to it. The database permission system is generally not capable of enforcing that kind of lockdown. Therefore, it is necessary to funnel its requests through a network API or else (unusual) a setuid program, which are capable of enforcing the lockdown.<p>A single-machine server is inherently insecure.

10145197,comment,10144905,10144905,0,0,throwaway90135,,,"ADHD can be quite debilitating at the extremes. Understanding what it is and how to cope with it is extremely helpful for those who are afflicted.<p>That said, it&#x27;s important to point out that the author of this post is defining ADD differently than the medical definition of ADD. The idea of hyperfocus is very popular among the self-diagnosed and on internet forums dedicated to ADD, but the term &quot;hyperfocus&quot; doesn&#x27;t actually appear in any of the medical literature I can find, with the exception of a few books that seem to suggest that &quot;hyperfocus&quot; is more likely related to the idea of perseveration, which is a deficit in set shifting ability. However, perseveration isn&#x27;t as selective as the concept of &quot;hyperfocus,&quot; which seems selective for enjoyable tasks.<p>The idea of hyperfocus as a component of ADD is part of a bigger problem: The modern pop-psychology definition of ADD has been watered down and expanded so much that it is beginning to feel more like a horoscope than a medical diagnosis. Even official medical diagnostic criteria can&#x27;t seem to agree on how strict the definition of ADHD is. For example, ICD-10 ADHD diagnostic criteria will yield a rate of roughly 1-2% ADHD in the general population of children. Using the DSM-IV criteria, that number rises to roughly 6-7% of children.<p>However, if you have the average person read an internet definition of ADHD or follow one of the first results for &quot;ADHD test&quot; in Google, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find an average college student or tech worker who <i>wouldn&#x27;t</i> identify as at least mildly ADHD per the pop-psychology definitions. Take a look at one of first results in Google for &quot;adhd test&quot;: <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/addquiz.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psychcentral.com/quizzes/addquiz.htm</a><p>Questions such as &quot;How often are you easily distracted by external stimuli, like something in your environment&quot; are so vague as to be applicable to everyone who has ever been distracted by a notification on their phone. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve known anyone who wouldn&#x27;t agree with questions like &quot;How often do you have difficulty sustaining your attention while doing something for work, school, a hobby, or fun activity&quot; when we&#x27;re expected to sit through 8+ hour desk jobs doing things that frequently aren&#x27;t tasks we would have chosen to willingly pursue.<p>The growing misconception seems to be that for a non-ADHD person, it should be <i>easy</i> or somehow <i>enjoyable</i> to focus on the things that we don&#x27;t necessarily enjoy doing. That&#x27;s obviously not the case, but these casual redefinitions of ADHD as a disorder that is accompanied by an increased ability to focus on enjoyable tasks are really stretching the definition of what it means to have AD[H]D.",1440989249

Of course my CS degree didn&#x27;t teach me these things, but nor should it have. It was partly a foundation in the principles behind programming, partly an education in how to think about problem solving on a fundamental, quite abstract level.<p>The things I gained from it provided a great base from which to learn how to write software in industry, and whether I realise it consciously or not, everything I have learned and continue to learn is augmented with the knowledge of the fundamentals behind it, which is really, really valuable.<p>My opinion, and I&#x27;m more than willing to be challenged on this by anyone with counter-examples, is that learning to write software in industry, with teams, huge-scale systems, bosses, and deadlines, can only be done on the job. It&#x27;s not something that can be simulated in a university, and indeed one actually never stops learning even once in industry.<p>Things that are helpful on the job can only really be learned the hard way, by doing the job, failing, and seeing that a better way exists for next time, in a similar situation. There&#x27;s never such a thing as &#x27;the right way&#x27;, only &#x27;the right way for this situation&#x27; - and there are too many permutations and edge cases on what that could mean to be taught in a structured way in a degree. Therefore I don&#x27;t think universities should be in the business of even trying to accomplish this. They <i>should</i> be in the business of producing graduates who are able to learn professional programming with a broad and deep knowledge of the fundamentals as a base, which is a very valuable thing.<p>I think what the GP is describing is more like an apprenticeship than a degree, and who knows, maybe that (combined with at least some study of the most directly-related fundamentals) could be one future path for learning programming as a young school-leaver, in lieu of going to university. Perhaps a four-year apprentice would be quicker out of the blocks in their first &#x27;real job&#x27; than a 4-year CS degree grad, and perhaps that&#x27;s a much better, more economically viable way to train new programmers for standard, forms over data style web development or application development work.<p>My point is teaching to the job is a completely separate thing from learning the mathematical and logical underpinnings of CS from nearly first-principles, and should be approached as such. Let a CS degree be a CS degree, don&#x27;t try to morph it into a programming apprenticeship.",1440988918

Psychiatrists generally just prescribe medications and help to ensure they&#x27;re working as designed.

One interpretation of ADD is that certain brains are tuned to have higher thresholds for driving bottom up attention. The result of this is that in a &#x27;normal&#x27; educational environment all stimuli fall well below the threshold for engagement so attention jumps all over the place because there is no signal strong enough to hold it. Now, take that same brain out into the woods and let it wander around and look at things and explore and where the &#x27;normal&#x27; brain is overwhelmed by the sound of the wind in the leaves and the patterns of light on the forest floor the ADD mind sees the footprints of the deer and the outline of a grouse.",1440988716

Unless you&#x27;ve been programming since you were 12, the programming you&#x27;ve done for your CS degree has not prepared you to write code in the industry and, in fact, has probably given you a ton of bad habits that will need to be broken when you get your first job. Just an example, but I find that fresh college grads don&#x27;t commit/push their work nearly as often as they need to. I find that school encourages a mentality of spending all the time you have making it as good as you can make it when it&#x27;s far more valuable in the industry to share your work with coworkers as early in the process as possible. I have to watch our new-grad hires like a hawk or they&#x27;ll hold their story until code freeze and commit at the last minute and make QA&#x27;s job harder.<p>The good news is that you&#x27;ve been taught a framework for thinking about how computer programs perform as the size of data gets huge. The bad news is that jobs where you&#x27;re writing the kind of code that deals with huge data are few and far between. Sure, we&#x27;ve got more data than ever these days, but we&#x27;re using libraries and products that have already handled much of the CS work.<p>To echo another poster, between a CS grad, a bootcamp grad and someone with a year of professional experience, I&#x27;ll take the professional experience every time.<p>The bootcamp grad has gaping holes in his skill set...I interviewed 8 of these at a hiring event and while each of them could talk intelligently about the 4 technologies they&#x27;d been taught, not one of them had even heard the term &quot;load balancer&quot; or could even guess what it might be used for.<p>The CS grad has useful knowledge, but I can teach the small portion of a CS curriculum that&#x27;s applicable to the jobs I hire for. Big-O notation is a pretty simple concept and it takes two seconds to look it up for the data structures we use. And has been said elsewhere, in the real world, n is usually pretty small and the constants matter. And yes, I realize the irony of saying that because of Google, a product that required a ton of CS knowledge to create, a formal CS background is less important.<p>Only the one with experience isn&#x27;t starting from near-zero. And that&#x27;s alright...I&#x27;m firmly in the camp that believes that college shouldn&#x27;t be a trade school. It has value in and of itself and shouldn&#x27;t be expected to teach the skills that are needed on the job. But that also means that it doesn&#x27;t give you that leg up that you seem to be expecting it to. Your degree will get you in the door, but mostly because our industry is starved for talent right now, but you&#x27;ll only be valuable once you&#x27;ve gotten real-world experience.",1440987121

Yes! There is a school of thought that says ADD is more of a &quot;personality type&quot; than a &quot;disability.&quot;<p>Generally I view it that way as well.

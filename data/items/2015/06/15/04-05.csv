9717587,comment,9711367,9715575,0,0,pron,,,"> I would think that all of your so called &quot;escape hatches&quot; are just as brittle<p>Why are they brittle? They&#x27;re not brittle at all, they just have looser semantics than the core language. They have their own semantics, which the runtime guarantees to uphold.<p>> that binary will always run the same... If you aren&#x27;t testing your code before deployment, that&#x27;s your fault.<p>Why work in such a primitive way? We&#x27;re very familiar with what happens when source-code is overly dependent on a specific compiler version. Besides, dropping to C/assembly in a language with such a high-level runtime (not only a GC but its own global scheduler) is not an escape hatch; it&#x27;s just using power tools to break through a hatch-free thick wall, which might work if you&#x27;re careful not to break the foundations by mistake. You could do the same in all languages that do provide an escape hatch, too (if you&#x27;d rather break through the wall instead of using the hatch).<p>> Too much &quot;clever&quot; is bad when programming.<p>Absolutely, but sometimes just the right amount of clever can let you do truly powerful things that would otherwise be beyond the reach of the language. It&#x27;s there just for those moments when you&#x27;re stumped[1].<p>Experience (and I&#x27;ve been doing this for twenty years) shows that this point where some cleverness is necessary, always arrives at some point in the project&#x27;s lifetime, and that cleverness often saves you a whole ton of work. Remember, the average codebase lifetime is about 10 years.<p>[1]: Plus some truly powerful stuff, like the ability to inject tracing code into a running application and then take it out.",1434344358

9717572,comment,9714805,9715180,0,0,crdb,,,"Different line of argument: think of that which is not seen [1]. Most of the arguments presented here take only the current residential population, and current time into account, but cities evolve over time and see large in- and outflows of residents (how many people on HN have lived in New York at some point in their life? how many New York residents aren&#x27;t from New York?). Even the most solidly conservative areas of the world change - I grew up in London&#x27;s South Kensington in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and recently visited again to find it had turned into a sparkling clean pedestrian area with hipster smoothie bars and back-to-back Ferraris...<p>Rent control coupled with NIMBY planning restrictions benefit connected locals who are able to secure the resulting limited spots and hinder the ability of non-residents to move in. In the short term, this freezes the existing situation - you keep your historical streets, you avoid SF turning into Hong Kong or Singapore ([2]). In the long term, (relatively asset-) poor entrepreneurial people move elsewhere (New York, Chicago, Austin... even Houston). Of course, it takes a LOT to move a global hub. We might not see it in our lifetime (how long did it take for New York to dethrone London as the global financial HQ).<p>The only way I&#x27;d move to SF would be if a company paid me a significantly larger amount of money, or once I retire to take advantage of the weather and food. So, do you as an SF resident see the city as a beautiful museum to be preserved, like Venice or EC2 in London, or is SF really about frontier spirit, which today looks more like Hong Kong than suburbia?<p>A better way to deal with bubbles is to tax them, as many nations such as Norway do with natural resources. If there is an enormous inflow of Chinese money, who are taking advantage of the great rule of law and property rights afforded by the American taxpayer to anybody willing to pay for said property, tax the property holder for the privilege. The bases at Guam and Okinawa aren&#x27;t paying for themselves... how about 5% of the assessed property value a year, if you aren&#x27;t a citizen or tax resident. The foreign money will STILL come because they still derive value from owning foreign property in attractive places, the probability of it being politically seized being virtually zero (I guess property taxes on foreigners are a form of seizure, though). The people who made the neighbourhood what it is benefit from the increased tax revenue (e.g. in decreased taxes or better services).<p>Singapore has a form of this - citizen can purchase HDB fresh builds (~80% of the market) at up to a 40% discount and without foreigners bidding for the first 4 years of the building&#x27;s existence. (France also does, the ISF [3], but it applies to citizen and, due to rising property values, is chasing retired working class folks from their own homes as they do not have the liquidity to afford the tax.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bastiat.org/en/twisatwins.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://scifanatic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/stid-t3-08.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scifanatic.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_tax_on_wealth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_tax_on_wealth</a>",1434343955

I must have hallucinated having that ability last night.)<p>> I would argue that objects are nothing more than a uniquely identified run-time entity. With that identity, they can easily have their own encapsulated state (since their identity can be used as an address or key into a global map), and can be associated with behavior that is selected dynamically.<p>I largely agree and believe this is pretty consistent with the commonly accepted definition of an object in the Comp Sci sense.  There are a couple examples which immediately come to mind (Smalltalk, Objective-C) along with other languages (Ruby, Perl, Python) having the ability to selectively provide equivalent behaviour.<p>Where I previously said &quot;largely agree&quot;, the point where I disagree is when you state &quot;objects are nothing more than a uniquely identified run-time entity.&quot;  Objects also have associated with them a set of messages which are either intrinsic to the environment&#x27;s definition of what minimally constitutes any object&#x27;s behavioural contract, identified by the definition of the object&#x27;s type, or some mixture of the previous two along with a mechanism to resolve message dispatching.<p>> Compare this with the dual of an object, the value, whose identity is determined by its structure alone (e.g. 1 and 1 are the same values), and so does not allow for state, nor does it allow for dynamic behavior selection without first turning them into objects (aka boxing).<p>Here, I think we disagree as not all languages treat values as being disjoint from objects.  I realize you mention boxing, which languages such as C# and Java perform for _their_ definition of &quot;plain old data&quot; types, but this is not the same as languages such as Ruby, which represents all values as objects intrinsically.<p>> The only fallacy, I think, is ascribing a notion of objects based on a couple of mainstream data points.<p>The fallacy which I mentioned is in thinking that a person has the same checks in JavaScript applied to collaborations as is expected in other OO languages/environments.  I view this as a direct consequence of JavaScript objects being hash maps.  Supporting this view is:<p>> A JavaScript object is an unordered collection of variables called named values.\n(source: <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_definition.asp</a>)",1434343391

Go&#x27;s solution is to make the 3 critical members private so that someone using this struct will probably figure out they should use a construction function.

With all this friction, people aren&#x27;t likely to do the right thing.<p>At least in C++ with public members I can initialize appropriately in the constructor.

No surprise, I have never been in a relationship.<p>I have been trying to find a girl to date in SF ( or bay area ) but so far I have had no luck. I am not very blessed in terms of looks. Due to premature baldness I now shave my head.  I go to gym regularly, take care of personal hygiene, smell good.<p>I have very low social confidence though.

What can I do to improve my social circle. I want to meet as many people as possible and improve my social presence.  I am planning Salsa class, joining tennis club.<p>2. A few times I have had experience that in SF people judge immediately based on looks.

I think Harry&#x27;s strategy plays well into both what you&#x27;re describing, though targeting the profitable, high-end sector of the market (as opposed to the ultra-cheap commodity razor market).<p>They recognized that the existing players on the high end were reaping above-average profits from their brand + distribution, but without strong product differentiation. If they could (and it seems they are) launch a strong brand with good quality products at substantially lower prices, they could earn a sizable chunk of the market. Cutting out retail margins and owning their factory should let them keep pretty strong margins even on the reduced price.

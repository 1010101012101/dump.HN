31178,comment,31059,31128,0,0,tx,,,"I'd argue that there are at least two other <i>MORE</i> important factors: JS (IMHO) is somewhat closer to Ruby, compared to Python. In fact I suspect that his ""secret 20% project"" is Ruby to JS compiler (or vice versa)<p>Also, (most importantly) using the same language for server <i>AND</i> client development is big-big win. He's been dreaming of a universal ""web platform"" which allows you to have real development process: pieces of you app here and there, and you freely move them around, executing server or client side, whatever works best for you at the moment. Because right now you have this huge stack of things to keep bookeeping for: HTML/CSS/JS/Ruby/SQL, all sitting in their own little files with their own little syntax. At least he got last 3 merged into one solid JS framework.<p>",1182966937
31177,comment,30922,30935,0,0,Goladus,,,"I like this reply:<p><i>I don't know what I should and shouldn't say because of the NDA, but it's probably okay to say I'm married to a Googler. He hasn't been there too long, but the only problem we've had so far is that he never seems to want to come home!<p>Seriously, though, I've seen a lot of articles that might be labeled ""sour grapes"" about Google lately. (Not to imply that yours is one of them - you made an effort to support your conclusions and it does sound as though you know some unhappy people, which is unfortunate.) The thing is, I've seen my husband go through jobs at other corporations. I've waited up for him on the nights when he was forced to work overtime on a doomed project. I've been there for him while he struggled under the tyranny of dangerously ignorant management. I've seen him waste weeks of his time because of thoughtless and fruitless penny-pinching. He started out so bright, so full of energy and zest for what he does, and over time I watched that energy and passion wilt under buzzing florescent lights in suffocating cubicles.<p>Corporate life in general is terribly depressing. I personally hate it and work independently. I love what I do and at least this way no one can take my enthusiasm away from me.<p>But that's exactly why I think what Google is doing is terribly important. More companies need to be that way. They need to be families who treat their employees like children - they take care of them. They reward them for their hard work. They encourage them to be creative, because they know (and you know, too) that it only takes one good idea to make a million dollars. Or a billion. Or an empire.<p>I'll say this: my husband has never been happier. For that, I'm exceedingly grateful to Google. They've given him something that he deserves, that everyone deserves. I wish it were more widely available. I wish we all could be free to be children, to feel like it's okay to laugh, to look forward to waking up, to nurture the bright and crazy ideas that wander through your head. That really doesn't sound like a bad world to me.</i>",1182966647
31176,comment,31059,31059,0,0,tx,,,"Fine effort indeed. But do not forget, he had to do all that heavy lifting just to fit into google's corporate policies. To me JavaScript makes very little sense because I like RoR mostly for the <i>first</i> 'R'. <p>Putting Ruby aside, I don't see much of ""rapid"" or ""pragmatic"" (most hyped words) in Rails. I am coming from ASP.NET and I don't see ""Rails"" part as a major step forward. The need to manually implement most of user logins/accounts/sessions in Rails alone killed all the time savings I had provided by ActiveRecord.<p>Frankly, I don't see why everybody is so hyper on MVC. I has been around for ages, old&stinky MFC in 1991 had doc/views but nobody calls MFC cool :-) Is that because more and more of web development is done by people without CS degrees who had never heard of MVC before? <p>",1182966632
31175,comment,30853,30873,0,0,bls,,,"How are you going to deal with piracy? I have been in Thailand for about half a year. While I was here I had a lot of software ideas to help Thai kids learn English. But, the licensing of high-quality language materials to embed into the software is expensive, so I cannot give it away for free.  Yet, most of the Thai people I know think the idea of paying for software is laughable (literally).<p>Also, from what I know, most people in Asia only have access to computers in internet cafes. Isn't that problematic for you?",1182966406
31174,comment,31137,31172,0,0,Readmore,,,"Fair enough, but I've been using RoR for 2 years and it is amazingly useful. It's a far better web programming environment than php or django. If you didn't like it that's cool, I really don't care, but don't submit your language bashing blog post to newsy. Also, it doesn't really matter if you're a rip off of hot or not as a user that's the first thing I thought as I clicked the back button away from your site.",1182966241

31171,comment,30922,31015,0,0,Goladus,,,"I understood ""google doesn't offer a career path"" to mean that there's no structure in place to help you advance to more valuable positions, not necessarily from coder to management.  ""Developer to Technical Architect"" is one example given.  <p>The problem with the traditional corporate structure isn't that advancement is bad, it's that there's often a mistaken assumption that the only thing more valuable than an individual contributor is a manager of individual contributors.<p>In the end I think this one is a wash.  It's hard to see how you could do it both ways, and there are advantages to each.  Google's ad hoc style seems to allow freedom to grow in whatever direction you want, and Google will decide later on if it's worth a promotion (to SDE II etc).  The author seems to envision a system where the company has specific needs, and will support an employee with training and mentoring until he fits those needs.",1182965586

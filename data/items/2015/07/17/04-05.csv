This is more relevant if you are in a position where you do not have much opportunity or power, or if you care about those people in such a position:<p>> Millions of workers have become organized into rural unions which are very rarely discussed. One of the slogans that they use which is relevant here, is that we should &quot;expand the floor of the cage.&quot; We know we’re in a cage. We know we’re trapped. We’re going to expand the floor, meaning we will extend to the limits what the cage will allow. And we intend to destroy the cage. But not by attacking the cage when we’re vulnerable, so they’ll murder us.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/199704--.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chomsky.info/interviews/199704--.htm</a><p>edit: it is perhaps useless to think about money without thinking much more broadly about the system that money forms a part of. which human activities are encouraged and discouraged by the system? which individuals benefit? which individuals suffer? is the human economy separate from the physical/natural environment?",1437109069

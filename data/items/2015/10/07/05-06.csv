10344393,comment,10340262,10343262,0,0,bcg1,,,"You make excellent points.  I guess what I meant was that Zillow&#x27;s model _should be_ to improve the process and to make it cheaper.  Maybe 6%-7% commission is still appropriate for high-end properties that only have a limited pool of potential buyers (that&#x27;s not my world, I don&#x27;t really know) but for average homes in 2015, it is an anachronism left over from a time when buyers and sellers couldn&#x27;t do a lot of the legwork themselves online.  Its not hard to see that there is a ton of money to be made closing that gap.<p>Just perused your website and from what I read your company certainly seems to have the right idea.  As it happens our buyer did end up having an agent and we paid that agent a 3% commission, so from what I read your system definitely could have worked in our transaction and saved our buyer some dough.  The $300 we paid the agent to get us into the MLS truly paid off though... we saved literally thousands.  Looking back I could pay triple that and it would be a no-brainer.  Just something to consider - toss in some boilerplate forms or instruction guides or whatever and it could be a great product with excellent margins.  I bet theres a bunch of tech savvy go getter millenials that would get licensed to do the local work necessary.  Anyhow, I&#x27;m really glad to see someone doing what you&#x27;re doing, best of luck to you... I truly hope you win",1444197556

You&#x27;ve probably heard of him (rcc9la26d7534400a6a03514c34f9200@reply.craigslist.org). He&#x27;s got a sure thing in the content discovery business, it&#x27;s sort of like Mosaic for Google Chrome, but we use the Tinder layout. We launched the MVP in Aberdeen, Saskatchewan Province in Canada[0] and have market penetration of ~5 which is a total and a percentage. We already have more users than there were fatal cougar attacks in North America the previous decade[1] which is the top metric VCs look for.<p>Thanks though does mean a lot, and we are scaling globally so I can probably hook you with up a DBA position. We&#x27;re full stack so just basic stuff e.g 5+ Years of Swift, and obviously experience with a robust database framework like Microsoft Access with a google drive caching layer, adobe dreamweaver a big plus.<p>I couldn&#x27;t work the joke in about our computatiom engine using godaddy and a ti-83 plus silver edition, so I&#x27;ll just come out and say it so you know we&#x27;re serious.

The US got out of its last major debt (ie: World War 2) by raising taxes on the highest bracket to 91%, and holding it there from 1940s through 1964.<p>This is misleading.  The effective tax rates were roughly the same then as now - very, very few people paid those high rates.  Instead a lot of effort went into hiding income, getting tax deductions made into law, getting compensation in forms other than taxable income, etc .  (For example, this is why employer paid for health insurance came about.)  There were people who weren&#x27;t able to avoid the high rates, but it was a tiny percentage of revenue.  These high rates distorted economic activity (and surely stopped some economic activity that would have happened).<p>The reason the US got out of WW II debt is that federal spending dropped dramatically after WW II and the US had the advantage of being the major industrialized country that wasn&#x27;t attacked in WW II.<p>An intro to the topic:\n<a href=""http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ib_19.htm#.VhShIIShbVr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/ib_19.htm#.VhShIIShb...</a>",1444194158

The only time I require getters and setters for primitive types (for example, name) is if I were to read in data from a user generated form that needed to be sanitized.</i><p>It's funny, too - though this type of thing goes against best practices, the primary argument for always using getters/setters (some day you might need to validate input or do other sorts of logic, and it's a pain in the ass to put that in after the fact) is pretty much 100% shattered these days, because any IDE worth a damn makes it possible to switch from public field access to getters/setters in a couple of keystrokes (""Encapsulate field"" and ""Inline method"" are typically all you need).<p>Though it's worth keeping in mind, most of the Java best practices tend to assume that you're writing code that other people will have to use, people whose codebases you won't have access to after you release your code, and that's a much more difficult context to program in.

So far there hasn't been too much success in self-serve ad platforms (aside from Ad Sense / Ad Words / Facebook ads), but I don't know why exactly.

Maybe once they reach that level then having a template builder isn't really a big deal - they can make their own creatives too.<p>There is so much money in online ads that you are just a pivot away from major success.

So boiling it down to three steps might be:<p>(1) Create a banner using our templates (and show examples here so I have some idea what you are talking about)<p>(2) Set your daily budget, ad networks, and demographics. We'll handle the details<p>(3) Track your progress using our custom campaign monitor<p>This information would ideally replace your ""Free"" banner and copy that is the focal point of your design.",1277597638

""Create compelling ads at an affordable price..."" is way too pale, almost invisible on my laptop screen<p>2. Clicking on ""Business Users"" shows ""Free!..."". This should have a ""how it works"" or ""why it's free"" link <i>right there</i>, because that's the definitive question I have after reading the testimonial (which is also set in a way too pale color by the way)<p>3. I haven't even noticed the Free banner wrapped around the cow, because frankly the cow illustration looks out of place and I just skipped over it altogether. The illy is more fit for a Kinder Surprise ad rather than for your type of service.<p>4. The service being ""free"" does not correlate well with ""set your budget"" step on the right hand side. Also the width of ""Start now"" button is not the same as the width of the panes on that list.<p>5. IMO the name is awful. The ""yo"" part specifically. In fact the ""yo"" coupled with a winking cow implies ""yogurt"".<p>6. The way I understand it, your major proposition is an ability to easily post to multiple ad networks. THAT should be highlighted on the page, and the list of the networks should be readily available for inspection.<p>7. The availability of the templates is not important. Perhaps I am wrong here and capitalizing on the lack of rudimentary Photoshop skills <i>is</i> the next big thing, but consider the following. The fact that ""Start now"" leads to the page full of templates (none of which I like) made me not want to proceed to the next step even for the evaluation purposes. This in turn means that I didn't get to see the list of your ad networks and geo targeting goodness.<p>8. In the light of #7 it'd be great to have a Tour section for those who are curious but not quite ready to ""Start now"".",1277597617

They surely aren't assuming that iPads and regular Macbooks are being used in perfect lighting conditions, which is an unreasonable assumption to make for any portable device.<p>I would actually argue that glossy displays are not ideal in any lit environment, for the simple reason that blacks just turn the display into a mirror. This is also a problem if you've turned down the brightness in order to save power.<p>Matte really needs to be the default for any display, with glossy as an option.",1277597435

Because it's fashionable?<p>Working at a startup is a good goal-- it's a fun work environment with a small tight-knit team.<p>STARTING a startup should be fueled by either a missionary zeal or a desire to gamble with 2+ years of your life to make a big pile of money (the average time to liquidity for VC backed startups is ~7 years).  If you don't have one of those two, I can all but promise you'll burn out and/or get bored.<p>My advice: wait for an idea/market that you love to pop into your head that you can't ignore.  In the meantime, work at a startup for a decent salary (don't sacrifice much salary for options-- it's a sucker's bet).",1277597434

Some of the gray areas look a bit light/hard to see on my screen, but that's nitpicking, nothing to worry about at this early stage. Nice branding, and the layout is great. I'd change the ""edit"" to ""customize this ad"" or just ""customize"" because I clicked on the ad graphic to customize, but that launched a preview. The word ""edit"" didn't get my attention. Next, I'd put the ""update"" button down at the bottom next to ""clear | download"" because I had to look for how to update my ad changes, and intuitively it should be under the editing boxes (""update ad"" for the text). I can't find anything else to critique/improve. Nice.",1277597352

Besides thats the only managed dedicated service I had experience with.<p>True story (a bit off-topic). Couple of years ago when I had HG Dedicated Elite Account with them for about 1 year. I think they charged me for one month or so after that there was a bug on the system and they didn't auto charge me every month (and I didn't check, I assumed they charged). After about 1 year, they found out the problem and they contacted me and explained the situation (I checked my bank account and verified). They gave me an option and told me that I don't have to pay for their mistake (~3k I owed them), but if I continue to use their service I will have to pay. I decided to leave. I was particularly going through a hard time financially during that time and I thought it was unfair situation for me to be put in a place where I have to pay a lumpsum amount to keep using their service when it wasn't my fault. Anyways, I wasn't necessarily proud of myself for not paying them. However I would highly recommend them simply because of their excellent customer service and their reputation.",1277597280

I'm going to guess the main reason for the speed issues is bad queries (m*n joins, no/few indexes etc). The best solution is often a rewrite in these cases.<p>What I meant by (b) was to put the entire database in RAM and let users access it by logging on to the server directly. You can put the MDB files on a file-server network share (like P:\Database\Company.mdb) and 10 people can use it at the same time as long as they all have Access 97 on their local machines and have read/write access to the P:\Database folder. Instead of doing it this way, try this for super speed: setup a fast Windows server with tons of RAM, create/format a 2GB-16GB partition as drive D:, install SuperVolume to load that entire drive D: to RAM. Move the MDB files here.<p>Don't make users open the MDB files from their PCs directly. Let them log on to a Windows Server as Terminal Server (TS) users and access it from the D: drive. If you have some money, install Citrix so logging on to the TS could be done by just visiting a website and logging in. This would let people from all over the world use the Access MDB at exactly the same speed as anyone physically logged into the server. With Citrix, you'll only need 20-32kb of bandwidth for most users.",1277596923

Keep in mind that ""looks"" doesn't necessarily mean ""good looking,"" it just means an assessment of competence based upon physical appearance.<p>I think our knee-jerk reaction these days is to assume that looks don't matter categorically, and that any time we observe humans judging others based on looks some primitive bias is at work.<p>Two things come to mind that might challenge that assumption:<p>1. If outward appearance were such a poor determiner of attributes like competence, humankind's use of appearance to formulate snap judgments about others would be an exceptionally poor survival strategy from an evolutionary perspective.<p>2. The fact that we are duped from time to time by the Warran Harding's of the world could in fact be the exception that proves the rule. That is, because the rule proves true so frequently in our experience, it leaves an opening for the occasional impostor who looks the part to take advantage of our otherwise frequently accurate intuitive judgements.<p>Like the commenter above you said, I'd be interested in seeing someone test these theories more thoroughly, perhaps against a profession where competence can be more objectively measured.",1221393567

Correspondent #2 criticizes Java as it was (and mostly still is)... which doesn't necessarily clash with Broomfield's estimation that Sun/Java didn't nail the client issues as it should have.",1221393348

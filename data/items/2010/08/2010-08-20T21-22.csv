The interesting thing is though, in retrospect, the 'ill advised platform' brought out the best in me in many ways, and I wonder if I had learned as much as I did had the platform been more powerful. There's nothing more satisfying than taking something that any sane person would say can not be done and then doing it anyway simply because nobody told you it couldn't be done.<p>I think of the whole thing as a character building exercise ;)<p>And I have learned to have great respect for the people that make industry work, the guys behind the lathes and the mills, the 'operators' that have more knowledge in their pinky about metal and metal working than most people will acquire in a life time of book knowledge.<p>They taught me more about feeds and speeds and materials than I ever wanted to know. And they also taught me that I'll never be a good machinist, even though I'm safe and can make what I want I just can't spend the lifetime on gaining all that knowledge.<p>One nice anecdote about that. One guy was complaining about the precision, this was in a factory of gears called 'Mak aandrijvingen', the guy told me while listening to the machine (in a factory full of noise at that) that it was running about 1/100th wide close to the chuck.<p>I thought he was pulling my leg, brought out the micrometer, sure enough 1/100th wide. We adjusted the table a tiny bit with to reduce the offset but overcompensated, during the next trial run he told me it had gotten worse, probably around 0.05 mm. Sure enough, the exact amount was very close to that. After that I started to slowly believe that this guy was so attuned to his machine that he could hear how much material it was taking off and as a consequence knew how much was left.

I'm lower middle class/upper lower class born actually, so would it be even more remarkable if I did it?

Patio11 makes a good point about the truism 'Startups take over your life' being a somewhat artificial construction.<p>I will play contrarian and argue the opposite side of it.<p>No matter how well some people manage to integrate their work life with their family life, they would still be more free to compete if they had no family.<p>Maybe you have created enterprise software and a large company in Texas, USA, calls you and asks to come pitch to the CEO tomorrow. How free are you to get out of any personal obligations so you can be there in Texas tomorrow?<p>Maybe you are selling support for open source software, are you free to work 80 hours a week for the first 2 years, just to get things going?<p>Maybe you are focused on electronics in Asia and you are trying to learn about the various laws and electrical infrastructure requirements in each country. It would also be nice to know something about the culture of these countries, their customs and history - each week, do you put an extra 5 hours toward learning background information about these countries, or do you put that extra 5 hours toward your personal relationship?<p>My overall feeling is that you can start a personal relationship at any point between the age of 14 and 84, but the first 2 years you are trying to get a startup off the ground is unique, and I think during those 2 years, much of the rest of your life should be put on hold.<p>If you end up competing against my startup, and I'm putting in 10% more than time than you, then you better be 10% smarter than me to balance things out. In my case, that is not very difficult, I am fairly stupid so you might well be 10% smarter than me, but you might eventually face competition that is, in fact, smarter than you, and willing to put in a lot more time than you. What then?<p>At the risk of sounding like some kind of Zen guru, I do think you need to ask yourself what you truly want. While we are all subject to random chance, there is a large extent to which we can control our lives, and to that extent you will create the life that you strive for. What you think you want may be different from what you actually want, and you'd do well to think carefully about any discrepancy between your stated goals and your actual actions.<p>Possibly one way to figure out what you would be comfortable with would be to think about losing. If you end up competing in a particular niche, against someone just as smart as you, and your competitor wins because they work 100 hours a week, whereas you decide that your  personal relationship, and mental health, are important, so you only work 40 hours a week, then will you be okay with losing? Will you go on to have a happy life, or will you look back later and have regrets? In the book The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People the author Stephen Covey suggests ""Begin with the end in mind."" That's applicable here. Think about what outcomes you'd be comfortable with, and let that shape your actions.<p>Since I'm playing the contrarian here, I will try to end on a negative note: you will have more chance of success the less energy you invest in your relationship. You might be much happier if you focus on your relationship, but we are not talking about happiness here, only the success of your startup. Being able to devote 100% of your energy to your startup might only give you a very slight edge compared to other startup entrepreneurs, but every little bit of an edge helps.",1282340868

Automatic computers have now been with us for a quarter of a century. They have had a great impact on our society in their capacity of tools, but in that capacity their influence will be but a ripple on the surface of our culture, compared with the much more profound influence they will have in their capacity of intellectual challenge without precedent in the cultural history of mankind. Hierarchical systems seem to have the property that something considered as an undivided entity on one level, is considered as a composite object on the next lower level of greater detail; as a result the natural grain of space or time that is applicable at each level decreases by an order of magnitude when we shift our attention from one level to the next lower one. We understand walls in terms of bricks, bricks in terms of crystals, crystals in terms of molecules etc. As a result the number of levels that can be distinguished meaningfully in a hierarchical system is kind of proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the smallest grain, and therefore, unless this ratio is very large, we cannot expect many levels. In computer programming our basic building block has an associated time grain of less than a microsecond, but our program may take hours of computation time. I do not know of any other technology covering a ratio of 1010 or more: the computer, by virtue of its fantastic speed, seems to be the first to provide us with an environment where highly hierarchical artefacts are both possible and necessary. This challenge, viz. the confrontation with the programming task, is so unique that this novel experience can teach us a lot about ourselves. It should deepen our understanding of the processes of design and creation, it should give us better control over the task of organizing our thoughts. If it did not do so, to my taste we should not deserve the computer at all!""<p>Edit: <a href=""http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userweb.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD...</a>",1282339896

Our thoughts are that when a patient walks in they can check themselves in, and their check in can easily be integrated into the clinics scheduling software via the API. Furthermore, new patients can automatically fill out the (insurance/patient info) form and submit it electronically on their phone. This would reduce paperwork burden on the office manager and result in higher efficiencies. The clinic can schedule appointments and personalize the users page with their next appointment data, history and doctors notes, again seamlessly via integration with their practice management software. We have not yet integrated push notifications, but it is in the pipeline and I am sure you can see the implications. We transmit everything over SSL and do not store this kind of data on our servers so I would presume it would be HIPAA compliant. The larger vision is that these types of applications become developed for a wide array of verticals, and perhaps even monetized by their developers.<p>Based on feedback from a large minority of beta users we feel that the software needs some tweaking to make it easier to leverage beyond posting comments to your Presence.

Some equivalent of Caruana's grand comparison, from the supervised ML world, could also do much good.<p>In any case, it's an interesting topic, but we could go back and forth on it forever. GAs and their progeny (including ACO and NEAT) are fun to consider and lend themselves to accessible explanations, so they get a fair amount of press. Whether or not that's justified is something we'll likely disagree on---but I wanted to push back a bit against the implication, intended or not, that they're where the action is in AI today.",1282338868

Agriculturally, we are living in a post-scarcity world, unless the population triples again, and we have been for forty years.  What we need in agriculture today is not more efficiency, but more resilience and more justice in the distribution of the results.<p>It is inexcusable that today, forty years since the end of food scarcity, poor people starve to death every day while steers are fatted on corn and soybeans for the rich.  Through efficiency, we've achieved a post-scarcity world. Now we need to achieve a post-poverty world.  Efficiency is not going to get us there.<p>Locavorism might promote greater resiliency; but does it?  Does the long-distance and international food trade ameliorate or exacerbate the privation of crop failures?  Do small, local farms produce less fertilizer runoff per acre than big agribusiness operations?  (Historically, in first place, with the most agrochemicals applied per acre, has been the suburban lawn.)  Is locavorism an effective hedge against new pests devastating monoculture crops?  Does it effectively break down hierarchies of richer and poorer regions by reducing long-distance exploitation, or does it reinforce them by keeping the money of the rich close to home?<p>I don't know. But when you're sitting in a fancy restaurant, pondering whether the lamb on the menu, priced the same as 100 kilos of soybeans, comes from Niman Ranch down the road or from a giant ranch in New Zealand — don't delude yourself into thinking that that's a serious food policy issue.",1282338538

Ten years prior, humans will explore an asteroid, venturing into deep space for the first time in human history. Today’s same college sophomores will be 34 at that time, about a third of the way into their professional careers. For the engineering and science students in our nation’s universities today, these are not distant timelines; instead, cutting-edge technologies and innovations developed by this generation in the early phases of their careers will form the foundation for humanity’s next great leap.""<p>This guy talks about getting to Mars and the asteroids as if they were some kind of inevitable end result; as if the only choice is in whether we get there faster or slower.  I think this is a fundamental mistake.  Space travel (or even having an agency like NASA) is fundamentally a political decision.  In that light, Robert Braun is not predicting technology thirty years out (though that's hard enough).  He is predicting politics over that timeframe, which far far more difficult than the former effort.<p>Given that the original space program was created during the course of a great rivalry between superpowers, I say that aspiring space scientists would be better off applying for positions of the two next superpowers: India and China.  These two countries are in a position where they still have the need to demonstrate parity (if not superiority) in the field of technology.  An active space program is a good way for them to do that.",1282338276

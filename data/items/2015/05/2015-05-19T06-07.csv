But let me play the devil&#x27;s advocate here: When the telecoms have paid for the spectrum (there was an auction for the spectrum), how can you dictate what services they should charge for and what services they shouldn&#x27;t charge for ? The spectrum is a public resource, but when the telecoms have paid for it, aren&#x27;t they entitled to charge for the services they provide ?",1432018720

I agree with him and also will emphasize that it is a wide spectrum.<p>Very few &quot;senior folks&quot; are never interested in the &quot;how&quot; and &quot;what&quot;. It is just that you go through a cycle where initially someone else drives a lot of your projects; then you find yourself working independently on many projects. As you pick up more and more projects, you start delegating/helping other people pick up more work. Enabling you to do more things. Now what title you have is a function of your companies internal procedures. If you are new, I would worry more on aggressively just doing more and more projects. Till you feel comfortable going beyond the nitty gritty of programming to the why we take up one project vs the other; technical tradeoffs, business risks etc.",1432018436

</code></pre>
If ntpd gets notified of an impeding leap second via its peers (or the connected radio clock, GPS receiver, ...) it will set (struct timex*)->status |= STA_INS via the timex syscall (which it also uses to steer/speed-up/slow-down the clock).<p><a href=""http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/adjtimex.2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/adjtimex.2.html</a><p>The stock linux kernel works such that if ntpd will have set the STA_INS flag via adjtimex some time before, the kernel will do the leap-second insertion at the end of the UTC day.<p>If you disable ntpd and it doesn&#x27;t reset this flag (which I doubt it does, but you&#x27;d have to check), the kernel will insert the leap second on its own, even if ntpd is not running.<p>If you disable ntpd, and either ntpd on termination (which I doubt), or you via the adjtimex syscall, clear the STA_INS flag, then the kernel will not insert the leap second. After UTC midnight, the clock will then be one second off, and a restart of ntpd will slowly steer the clock back to correct time.<p>For playing with all of this, there&#x27;s a adjtimex tool which can display and even change the timex values:<p><pre><code>    ➜  sbin  ./adjtimex -pV | sed &#x27;s/^/    /&#x27;

9568447,comment,9567715,9567715,0,0,freedevbootcamp,,,"I think everyone has the capacity to be a quick thinker.<p>The two main components to being a quick thinker are not what you think.<p>The first one is a competitive spirit. If you have ever played any sports and you 
have felt the desire to win, this will get you half way to thinking quickly. Train yourself
to be able to look at the problem and give up many different possibilities rather than just the smoking gun fix.
Sometimes in a enterprise environment fixing the smoking gun is the most inconvenient. Being under pressure and
using the competitive spirit can be one of the most satisfying jobs.<p>The second one is know your environment. You have to know your environment from 
top to bottom and everything in between. You have to be able to visualize the problem
from inside and out in order to narrow the problem down to its core. The first thing you do 
at a new job is to find the documentation for everything and study it.<p>This vision of the environment could come from many different crafts whether it is a Network Engineer,
Software Developer, DBA, or Systems Engineer. But you have to be in a position of knowledge about the entire infrastructure.<p>In order to recall knowledge/experiences from memory quickly you have to be an expert pattern matcher. Sometimes its a new
problem that has never been discovered or documented but very rarely. Search google for the main topic and if you find a gazillion answers
you know its a common problem. If you cant find anything you know someone has changed something or broke something and is more than likely
a misconfiguration. How do you gain the knowledge in the first place? Reading. Reading books and blogs and stack overflow and everything you can get your hands on.
You wont retain all the knowledge but you will remember that you found a fix for it at one time or another and can search for it again quickly.",1432017795

Application Engineers at Rescale perform several important duties relating to customers as well as maintaining our extensive library of supported simulation software applications.<p>They fulfill a very general role in which problem solving will be one of their greatest assets. Application Engineers will be challenged on a day-to-day basis in dealing with the wide range of disciplines Rescale&#x27;s software library provides to its users.<p>Some of the day-to-day duties of an Application Engineer at Rescale are:
- Provide technical support to our customers. Help them solve various problems related to the software they are running on Rescale. This requires both a high level understanding of the software and an in-depth understanding of the environment the software runs in.
- Maintain the software available on Rescale. This includes installing and benchmarking the software. Optimizing the software&#x27;s performance for the environment it runs in may also be necessary.
- Build tools for automating the various technical tasks Applications Engineers perform on a day-to-day basis. Some tools that have been built by our application engineers are: an integration testing framework, an automated software installation framework, an asset management framework.<p>Rescale is looking for Application Engineers who possess most of the following skills:
- In depth knowledge of at least one HPC discipline (CFD, FEA, Molecular Dynamics, Weather Forecasting, Computational Chemistry, Reservoir (Seismic) Simulation, Rendering, etc)
- Good understanding of the Linux environment
- Good understanding of HPC, schedulers, MPI
- Good understanding of shell scripting

2.

On the other hand, mobile operators mention that any traffic other than internet.org supported sites will be charged at usual price.

Would sound corny but the best way to describe the experience is like what was shown in the movie &#x27;Limitless&#x27; - it was of course not to that extent, but after doing Yoga for few weeks I felt as if some fog was lifted from my brain (which prior to that I didn&#x27;t even realize was there), I was able to connect things much more efficiently, do pattern matching and all at subconscious level. Also, I realized I could remember long numbers (ex. ph no.) much more easily - I was never partial to mathematics right from childhood.
If I have to rationalize it then I would think its not only because of exercises, inverted postures (which allows more blood flow to your upper regions of the body) etc. but also due to breathing exercises - which not only helps your lungs but brain as well.<p>There are scientific work around Yoga and improvement on cognitive abilities, one that I could find easily:

Where you left off (prior to deferred ... shading I&#x27;m assuming and PBR) is still a bit a ways from where things get a bit more interesting. Physically correct rendering changes the game a good deal. We can&#x27;t haphazardly blur textures and add things and lerp like we used to.",1432015467

I can only imagine the thrill of discovering the right tones to play into the receiver to make Ma Bell do your bidding. Slowly mapping the network and figuring out what trunks connect where, finding the secret phone numbers that only telephone repair people are supposed to use, etc.<p>It just seems kind of lame to set up a SIP gateway and (ab)use the naive ANI/CLID facilities.

Getting to the point where it does something useful has higher priority than writing long messages nobody will read.

The little pin would probably be better served if it were below the short description next to the 'Book Profile' and 'Book Website' links on the browse page. Though since adding a book is really the primary action you want your user to take I'd say make it a really obvious button that goes underneath the image of the book cover.<p>Also once I've clicked on a book to learn more about it, there's no little pin icon on the in-depth description page. Again I'd suggest making it really prominent and obvious. I went back and forth between browse and the description page several times looking for it. I need the brain dead 'Add this thing' button. Your pages are minimal, which is great, because it means that you can make that button obvious very easily. I think there was a good HN article a while back about making the most important item on the page obvious. IMO adding something to my shelf is the most important user action because after I've added just one book I now feel like I have a bit of a virtual stake in that profile I just created and I will definitely come back to build my collection :)<p>Great idea! Thanks for creating it<p>P.S. Also just noticed that the hacker shelf logo and title text does not link anywhere. I'd suggest that take the user home.",1329235199

Insurance changes could make it extremely expensive in the space of a single year if they're on annual policies. If school boards are given the sudden option of running football at a substantial loss, pulling athletics programmes altogether and losing their value while mothballing their assets or trying to switch code, I'd bet on the latter.<p>Instinctively the elephant in the room is the different college conferences. Varied enough to go in different ways if push came to shove, big enough that they could impose a code change on their feeder systems. Plus, a big enough bottom-line contributor that if the numbers turned around fast enough I suspect administrators would try a roll of the dice rather than a mothballing.<p>(And I still want to see a greater uptake of cricket! :-))",1329235140

My brother, who is five years old, has used Google since he was three or four.<p>My entire life, I have been able to investigate my interests and other bits of information, with individual independence. If a news story interests me, I have been wired, by habit and what-have-you, to seek out the info when and from whom I want it.<p>A local news program once teased a fluff piece about some record-breaking octopus. They were hoping it would entice viewers enough to sit through the commercials and watch it when the program returned. In the past, this would have been the case.<p>But instead, because that subject piqued my interest, I went ahead and looked it up very quickly online. Immediately, through Google News, I had access to dozens of articles to whet my appetite. I got the jist of the subject, and then I moved on. All of this before the commercials on TV were over.<p>When the program returned, they dedicated seconds to the subject, and moved on. There was a huge difference between what I knew about the subject from what I learned online, and the very little I would have known if I had only relied upon the TV news segment. Entire generations are wired to rely on the latter, the youngest ones are wired to Google.<p>My parents, who are still rather young--they are both 41--are more likely to just wait for the news program to return.<p>These cultural differences blow my mind. They remind me how dynamic culture is, and how much it has changed even throughout the course of my short life.<p>I told my five-year-old brother a couple weeks ago, that the internet is not very old, and there was a long time when people did not have it. It was hard for him to grasp a time when people did not have Google. I have to admit, I ask myself that very same question all of the time.<p>(Head Explodes)",1329234531

More, the charger is largely optional, I could just plug them into into my computer -- often connecting to put podcasts on is enough to charge the mp3 player.<p>Only my laptop really requires a separate, dedicated power supply.

Eventually, though, they'll realize just how much time and energy they save with short, focused meetings.<p>Let's say that you're chairing a meeting, and it's going off-track in a non-productive direction. I've found that a pretty effective cure for meeting chatter and tangential discussion is raising the specter of wasted time. This could be as simple as: ""Guys, we have a lot to cover, and I want us to get out of here on time.""<p>A statement like that does two things. First, it places the burden on the side-trackers to get back on topic by making <i>them</i> look like the bad guys (and not you, who might otherwise be seen as too rigid). Second, it reminds everybody that the meeting isn't happening in a magical bubble of parallel spacetime. It's ticking away very real minutes from the workday -- minutes that nobody's getting back at the end of the meeting. (For some reason, people seem to lose conscious track of time in meetings, and later wonder where the day went).<p>Finally, we should note that time-wasting meetings usually stem from the behavior of the meeting chair. If you demonstrate that you're willing to cave on the agenda -- or that your agenda is improperly long, vague, scattershot, improperly socialized beforehand, etc. -- then you're going to lose the room. Likewise, if you kick off your meeting with idle chatter, you're going to get idle chatter in return. (Don't open with ""So, did you guys do anything fun this weekend?"" and then expect anything <i>but</i> a 20-minute digression). It may seem unnatural to start the meeting right on topic, absent the social lubrication of small talk. But a meeting isn't the time or place for small talk, as you've pointed out.",1329232296

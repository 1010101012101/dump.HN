3139737,comment,3136796,3138543,1,0,drallison,,,"What passes today as economic analysis is, in truth, modeling in which the assumptions and the data are implicit and only the conclusions are expressed.  Moreover, projections are frequently based upon simple extrapolation of a constructed macroeconomic indicator and rather than exploring the underlying structure.  It seems to me that ""politics and power and sex and violence"" and resource depletion,innovation, FUD, and all the rest is amenable to modeling and that a composite economic model based on systematic analysis is likely to better reflect reality than the process used now.<p>Asimov's Foundation Series books are enlightened works of science fiction, but they are fiction, not fact.

3139672,story,,,1,0,kunle,"The meaning of ""Social"" and Success in consumer internet",,"1. Social = adding structure to data<p>If you look at the internet as a repository of data of all kinds that is constantly being generated, the ""meta"" meaning of what ""social"" networks really do, is add structure to it, Basically by allowing people do things with that data (view it, create it, tell their friends about it, tell the world about it etc) you create a sort of ""tag"" that says; ""this is how important this data is"" eg. a facebook share is more valuable than a twitter share, because there are fewer shares and they are directly to people you know. A twitter share > google +1 share, because the receivers are opt-in vs. just anyone etc, and if you look at it that way, what social has basically done is reduce an infinitely expanding world of data with static tags (defined by the creators or by the content itself) to a smaller, more slowly expansive world of data with dynamic tags (defined by the people who look at it).<p>Dont know how to monetize this but its just arisen as a thought: Google won because search was primary way people found things, and the internet was small enough and their algorithms were good enough that they were able to filter out the noise. The real threat to google (of fb etc) is that the internet is so large and growing so fast, and their algorithms find it so hard to keep up, that at some point people always find noise in their google search, and structured data becomes the dominant way people find things in the majority of use cases. The second order threat (this will become more apparent in the coming years) is that the layers of social and all the public stuff that people do on the web, as well as improved AI, make it easier for other companies/ideas to dominate certain verticals of discovery (the easiest example I can think of this for is Quora - it's early but you could argue they have found a better method than search for mapping and discovering ""knowledge"" - particularly the subjective kind)<p>2. Success on the web = finding the broadest single use case, and nailing the process of getting that. The path is usually by finding a series of progressively broader use cases; this is called ""iterating""<p>This isnt really all that groundbreaking; continuing with the idea of applying web metrics to the real world to see if they pass muster (eg DAU/MAU for fridges, toilets and beds = 100%, which validates those metrics), you can argue that consumer internet success = ubiquity, and ubiquity is derived from finding a single use case that has the broadest reach (ie something that most people do every day, often a day) and nailing the way to do it on your platform (web or mobile or whatever else). So the easiest example is google; search was the primary way people discovered things 10 years ago, and google created a better way to search things than anyone else.<p>If you're looking for consumer internet success - perhaps you first find an activity that people do frequently, then create a better/easier/more valuable along one dimension (Eg instrumenting for better decision making or taking out a pain point) to do that activity. What this means is; if someone comes to you with an idea that sounds like 4 things, that is bad, even if the 4 things cover a lot of people/activity. If someone comes to you with an idea that sounds like 1 thing, and the one thing is highly repeatable, then the only question is; what are they paying to do that one thing today (and if they arent paying to do it, who will pay).",1319204745

He comes to Chicago often and spends a lot of time with us because we were his only investment here until last month), VP from Motorola Mobility (architecture tour), State Senator from Ohio (bar), A Macarthur Fellow Architect (female, met at bar), Vice Chairman for Goldman Sachs Investment Banking (happy hour),  etc etc etc.<p>Furthermore, just by chance (ie we didn't know this going in and it is NOT the startup hub area within Chicago), within 3 blocks of FeeFighters office are: 37signals, SproutSocial, Threadless, Crowdspring, and several other startups. I don't see how it helps us significantly to bump into them (though we have helped our neighbors when they've had merchant account issues). Many people think it is a wasteland anywhere not the valley but I have seen that not to be the case here, in New York, and even in Pittsburgh.<p>So what is the difference between here and there? The largest differentiator I've noticed between the valley and elsewhere is funding. We raised most of our money in Chicago from VC's we really like, but could have raised easier on the west coast. A lot of top VC's prefer to have you close and told us flat out they would fund us if we moved there. We had term sheets dependent on us being in Austin, SF, and LA. I don't think it has had an effect one way or another on our business thus far.<p>Startups need money, and often flock to where it is. Things are changing all over the place though (Rich people in Chicago all of a sudden want to fund startups, will be interesting to see if that continues post-Groupon IPO)
It also depends on your type of business. If you sell mainly to startups, you should probably be in the valley.<p>BTW in case you missed the discussion re: PG's original article, it is here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3077165"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3077165</a>",1319204743

We wrote our own COM binding which is much simpler and faster than something like LuaCOM because we don't use all of the features of COM (no installed classes / CoCreateInstance). It sounds simple on its face, but once you have a rich binding it can become complicated quickly as more and more code is written in the system and parts of code do things that you wouldn't expect or can't easily detect. We wound up writing our own debugger built into the embedding so that at any time we could pull up a console and interact with the engine and trace what was going on. Tools like that should be considered a necessity whenever you're creating an embedded script system inside a native code app.<p>When you're wrapping any ref-counted system into a GC system (e.g. Javascript wrapping gobject) there is the potential for great disaster, either ref loops or mem corruption as discussed in other posts here. It just takes training and discipline to make sure something you're working on is built correctly according to the rules of the system.<p>GC time has come up a bit as an issue, but it is mostly because our system is not linear in the sense that a game is. There are distinct states and times when the user is waiting and when they are not and it is an inopportune time to GC while in some specific states because it is perceived more by the end user. It is a balancing act to determine whether running the GC manually in the desired states provides a perceived or real difference than letting the engine run it whenever.",1319203345

</code></pre>
I'm reading this to say that memory usage wouldn't be as good if the second level was stored as a hash instead of a JSON blob.<p>My specific question was: why store the comment as a JSON blob as opposed to a hash?  I think Antirez answer was, in a nutshell: because a hash of hashes can't be stored as an array.  For news items it doesn't matter because the hash couldn't be stored as an array anyway due to the (anticipated) large number of news items.<p>Are you saying this interpretation is wrong?",1319202330

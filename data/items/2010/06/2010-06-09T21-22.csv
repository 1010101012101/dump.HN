1418437,comment,1417822,1418390,0,0,riffer,,,"I may not be the best example, because I am ridiculously frugal. There are very few things I pay for beyond food, rent and travel, which is another way of saying I pretty much exclusively use free tools. Incidentally, when my 30 day trial of Textmate ended, for some reason the software kept working and rather than pay for it, or stealing it by continuing to use it, I just switched to another editor.<p>That said, if I really wanted to spend money on Textmate, yes, I would prefer to pay 50 bucks rather than either $4 or $8 monthly. At a $1 or $2 a month, I would probably be indifferent. To some element there's an issue of how long the purchaser will actually use the tool vs. how long they estimate they'll use it.<p>I agree with you 100% that we develop countermeasures because we know that these recurring monthly plans are dangerous. My sense is that we develop the countermeasures exactly because the monthly plans are so effective at separating us from our money, and that the countermeasures only partly offset the tendency. Of course, for you may have an outright aversion to the monthly plans, just as I have excessive frugality, but overall my sense is that for most people monthly plans go over better than upfront charges in most situations.",1276120766

1418422,comment,1417442,1417442,0,0,tansey,,,"This article is using some anecdotes, a few outdated statistics, and poor mathematical analogies. The reason CS majors declined from 2004-2007 is because the stigma of outsourcing and failed dot-coms were still in people's minds. I know because I was helping recruit new CS majors at my school during that time, and jobs were the big thing we had to stress because parents were worried about that. According to people in my university, enrollments are back up in the last couple years because the tech market is still healthy.<p>Also, saying that you get 50 MBAs and 18 lawyers for every science/engineering PhD graduate is misleading. An MBA is a 2 year degree consisting of class work, a JD is typically a 3 year degree with some mock trial work and lots of book knowledge, and a PhD is typically a 6-year degree but that requires you to have successfully developed something novel enough to publish in peer-reviewed journals and/or conferences. Most people never finish a PhD, but that has little to do with them not liking science; it's about them not being able to take living in poverty any longer, when there are high-paying jobs in the real world they can jump to at any point. It'd be more interesting to see how many masters in STEM areas are given out relative to MBAs and JDs.",1276120279

These risks you point out exist today in one flavor or the other for AES as well; exploits loom around them, too (and to be fair, AES, too, has its fair share of dangers that Blowfish is immune to), but you seem inclined to ignore AES' case seemingly only because of its young age. Mind you, Blowfish has had its share of prying eyes, too, but I don't think that the amount of scrutiny involved in these two ciphers weighs particularly much at this point when both ciphers are still unbroken. What you're laying forth in AES' favor is really the exact same tune people sang in favor of DES 20 years ago. I find it ironic that, given Blowfish's strengths, you pass all of its use in modern software off as plain, simple vanity. Is OpenBSD's use of Blowfish vain in any way what so ever? Is interest in, or a requirement of, high performance or a compact codebase vanity?<p>And, just to end your weird assumption, let's <i>also</i> be clear that I threw out examples of cryptography libraries for the surplus value of having additional choices at hand, not in any was as passing out advices on what ciphers to use for what purpose.

I've cringed my whole life when people say ""I'm not good with computers..."" or display fundamental misunderstandings. However, that made more sense when the average person didn't use a computer as part of daily life. Now that they do, I thought this would subside... instead, it's gotten worse, and we have legislators who are barely at the ""You've Got Mail"" stage making critically important decisions about the internet, software patents, and so on. Every day I deal with people who have businesses based on the internet, but don't understand what an IP address, a pixel, or a server is.",1276117537

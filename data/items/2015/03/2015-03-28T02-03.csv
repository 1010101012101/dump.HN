Do you have some kind of data backing that up or is it just one of the Good Things that people like to say? For example, this article[1] discusses civic involvement, but it&#x27;s conceivable that diversity in a business environment could have a similar effect. Before the downvote brigade steps in, let me mention that I don&#x27;t think diversity is a bad thing, just that it might not be inherently positive. I think diversity needs to be coupled with some sort of unity (whether it&#x27;s a corporate motto like &quot;THINK&quot; at IBM, or a common religion, etc.) in order for it not to negatively impact a group.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/04/the_downside_of_diversity/?page=full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2007/08/04/t...</a>",1427511017

I never saw a transmitter, but I did find a number of tattoo guns which were usually manufactured from the impedance matching transformers that were used to get radio reception inside the units. There are some very inventive people incarcerated and they obviously had a lot of time on their hands. The bit about the guards being clueless is largely true as well. Even though the radios were in a translucent housing so that they could not be used to conceal contraband, most officers were not trained or otherwise able to identify a radio that had been modified, especially if carefully done. Officers were instructed to confiscate any radio that was modified, but this policy was often ignored. Supervising inmate housing is one of the least desirable assignments. It&#x27;s also often the case that if a housing unit isn&#x27;t causing too much trouble that enforcement might be relaxed as it can be more disruptive than just letting some of it go. The design of many Texas prisons requires officers to walk down a long corridor ~24 to 34 cells per tier, allowing ample time for inmates at the ends to stow contraband.<p>A point of trivia here that isn&#x27;t related to making AM transmitters but still interesting is that the type of radios that were really coveted by inmates were the ones that had a particular Sony PLL IC, I can&#x27;t recall the part number but it is fairly famous for being a very good receiver with high sensitivity.",1427509552

I watched it happen.<p>No, you <i>thought</i> you saw it happen. &quot;git push&quot; does not remove data, it can only add new commits (and their contents) and update refs (branch names and tags) so you were mistaken in what you saw.<p>> Sure, maybe the data was actually there<p>Yup, exactly. No data was lost. It was actually there.<p>> and a git god could have unwound whatever brain damaged state &quot;git push&quot; stuck the repo in<p>I like the &quot;git god&quot; moniker. Thanks! But it&#x27;s not really that complicated. What probably happened was that &quot;git push&quot; added a new line of commits, and updated your branch name (let&#x27;s say it was &quot;master&quot;) to point at these new ones. The old ones were still there though, they just weren&#x27;t an ancestor of your current &quot;master&quot; so you couldn&#x27;t see them immediately with &quot;git log&quot;.<p>If you wanted to get your repository back to its previous state, you just needed to look with &quot;git reflog&quot; and see what commit master used to point to, and then set it back to that. That&#x27;s the only change you needed to make. The repository wasn&#x27;t broken in any way, it just had a few more commits in it.<p>Now, you might say that &quot;git push&quot; shouldn&#x27;t make it so easy to do this: and you&#x27;d be right, so it doesn&#x27;t. You need to have used &quot;--force&quot; to get it to behave in this way. Really, if this is a happening regularly, you clearly have a broken workflow. Perhaps introducing some Code Review in there would help? Gerrit maybe?",1427508933

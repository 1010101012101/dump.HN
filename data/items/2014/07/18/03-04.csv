I realize the author(s) might think they are liberals, but they&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re reactionaries.<p>I can&#x27;t be a conservative. I have eyes. I can&#x27;t be a reactionary either because I&#x27;ve studied history, and I don&#x27;t buy the sugar coated version of it. There is nothing worth going back to, and there is little worth conserving except insofar as it serves as a platform and scaffolding to build something else.<p>I just can&#x27;t for the life of me understand how someone could be <i>truly</i> satisfied with this existence enough to want to conserve it... to protect it from change. Sure, some people are randomly selected by the genetic lottery to be handsome, intelligent, or born to wealthy parents or in a wealthy nation. I guess if you were one of those people <i>and</i> never bothered to contemplate beyond these immediate realities, nor to ponder the fundamental and utter brutality of that lottery itself, you might be satisfied.<p>Meanwhile the rest of us are trying to find some way -- be it through spirituality, technology, art, science, or religion -- to build a ladder tall enough to climb out of the hell that is the Darwinian process that gave birth to us.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I hate my life. I actually lead a pretty good one. I have people I really love, a good job, a great looking future. I guess I got a decent lotto ticket. But when I open my eyes and step outside myself and look objectively at the whole reality of my circumstance and those of the people around me, I can&#x27;t help but remember that I&#x27;m in hell.<p>So yes I sympathize with &quot;disrupt everything,&quot; even though it&#x27;s reckless and sometimes amounts to little in the end. At least it&#x27;s trying to do something. I even find myself sympathizing on some level with religious fanatics. I don&#x27;t share their metaphysics but I understand what could lead a person to that place. The thing that could make a person fast until near death, blow themselves up to achieve martyrdom, or drive nails into their own hands in imitation of Christ... that&#x27;s the same fundamental dissatisfaction with our position in the universe that makes us spend years trying to solve hard technical problems and build rockets to the moon.

It would be difficult or impossible to codify all the permissible extenuating circumstances, and leaving the question open-ended and letting it be decided in court would be a disaster, much worse than existing carve-outs like self defense as an excuse for homicide (which is itself kind of a mess, legally).<p>Certain dour strains of penal theory would argue that the &#x27;virtuous criminal&#x27; still requires equal punishment (Chinese legalism, for example), but I think the more popular stance in the modern day is that judges and state executives (governors, presidents) should have the option of leniency.

About the only way you get &quot;cohesion&quot; on the web today is by limiting yourself entirely to services from one company (Apple; Google), and even then it&#x27;s far from seamless. Yet, somehow we make progress.<p>So our goal is not to solve these problems, but to incrementally improve the state of the world. Clearly, the first thing that needs to happen in order for open source and decentralized web apps to be viable is there has to be a way that common, non-technical users can actually <i>use</i> them. Sandstorm is trying to offer a solution for that, and we think we&#x27;re pretty close. As much as possible, we actually try to stay out of the question of UI or API standards.

Five years of working with someone will do that to you.”<p>Who is “we” and what is the evidence for the conclusion? How is it true that 1) In 5 years all coworkers think exactly the same way; and 2) Some purported truth about human behavior relates to the general usage of a programming language within an opinionated and free community? This seems like some random statement without any (provable) basis in reality.<p>“It has always bothered me that people would advocate such broken systems (streams etc) when real-world alternatives were better even before now”<p>You’ve started companies, joined companies, and encouraged Node technology at companies. You’ve advocated for others to use the systems that you’ve built. These companies have investors and other who trust your judgement. Why did you advocate a broken system, for so many years? Or did you come to this conclusion just a few weeks ago? What led you to that conclusion?<p>“I&#x27;m definitely not the only one writing large systems, but I think the tolerance level varies per developer.”<p>I’m not sure that anyone I know who builds massive enterprise systems ignores the “bad parts” of a system. None of them are tolerant of bad ideas. You really can’t be if you’re a professional with responsibilities to your team, your company, and shareholders. To suggest that Node is popular because Node developers are more tolerant of bad systems is, well, a weak theory that I think doesn’t stand up to reason.<p>“Also plenty of people make a living/name from Node, of course they&#x27;re more likely to praise it than to be honest about its faults, I&#x27;m definitely a minority in that respect…Many of these same people make money from consultation, where it&#x27;s advantageous to have a broken system. I&#x27;m not trying to screw them over but someone has to be honest.”<p>It’s not controversial to point out that you have advocated for (praised) a system that you believed was full of faults, for years, for great profit, in many senses. So you’re indeed a minority, but not in the way that you think you are. All of this sounds, to me, a little screwy.<p>“This lack of insight is all over Node as a community.”<p>I’ve re-read the paragraph preceding the above conclusion, but have failed to find a cogent argument. Something about #addHeader, and Isaacs is rad, and something else about “building tiny little things and stitching them all together” is a fools errand — this seems to be an “insight”. From Eric Raymond’s Unix rules:  “Rule of Composition: Developers should write programs that can communicate easily with other programs. This rule aims to allow developers to break down projects into small, simple programs rather than overly complex monolithic programs.”. Unix has scaled pretty nicely.<p>Now, you may be right. Also, Raymond might be right. Also, the entirety of the thousands of developers who build serious, professional software by following this credo might be right. Or some may be wrong. Or all may be wrong. But the point is… I still don’t see you producing an irrefutable argument, especially since you want to conclude that Node is fundamentally broken, isn’t “ready for prime time”, and so forth. I mean, you’re the most prolific contributor to the Node project, and you have advocated on several occasions for exactly this sort of methodology. It’s confusing.<p>“It&#x27;s very easy to pass off problems with node as problems you&#x27;d have with any platform, but that&#x27;s unfortunately just not reality.”<p>Not sure what you’re saying here. I could link a few hundred articles covering every language, including Go, that say the same thing you’re saying about Node — but I don’t know what they’re getting at either. No programming language solves all problems, and is easier than all others, and has no mistakes in it, and etc. Do you dispute that? If not…why exactly is the fact that Node has some problems, and some imperfections, and some mistakes, a reason to dismiss it outright? From your earlier post: “my claims of node not being production ready are 100% legit, and based on real-world applications.”. 100% legit? That’s pretty legit! But howzit legit?<p>I’ve been a little hard here, but I feel I had to be. Again, you’ve been a great contributor to the project, and I hope you do some more great things.",1405652845

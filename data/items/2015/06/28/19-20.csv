Everything must be well thought out before you start to write a line (and yes, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s supposed to be but sometimes it&#x27;s easier to just hack something together to see what issues might arise, and then make it beautiful). On the other hand, the beauty of Haskell is that the code is much cleaner and modular. Don&#x27;t be fooled, though: Even in Haskell you can write very ugly code.",1435521472

A currency is just a measure of account, a medium of exchange and a store of wealth.  We&#x27;ve had centuries of common currency in the form of gold equivalence (i.e. a hard gold standard).  The moments we got into trouble with gold currencies are not inherent in the gold standard itself, but in the attempts by sovereigns to jiggle around with it (seigneurage, mixing gold with other metals, creating pretend gold-standards that allow them to create more paper currency than there is gold backing it up, etc.)",1435521448

If we assume that 1/18 SpaceX launches fail, then in the long run SpaceX wins as long as your typical payload cost is less than $46.5 * 18 = $837 million.<p>If we assume that the cost to replace the payload for a failed launch is less than the original payload (R&D costs are amortized, so it&#x27;s likely that building a second payload is much cheaper than designing and building the first payload), then the break-even payload cost can be even higher.",1435521443
9794834,comment,9794166,9794725,0,0,elorant,,,"<i>This is wishful thinking. It won&#x27;t happen anytime soon, if ever. For example, German politicians are scared of their voters who are completely unwilling to go along with this, which is exactly the reason why they have rejected such proposals for five years now.</i><p>It’s already happening. ECB issued a QE program in January for buying out national bonds for one trillion Euros.<p><i>Indeed the problem is not the debt, but for now it is also not structural reforms. Structural reforms are required in the long term, but they won&#x27;t fix anything now and in any case, you can&#x27;t change a country in a few years. This will take a long time.<p>The main issue is simply that the economy has tanked, unemployment is high, etc. and this won&#x27;t change by imposing more austerity. The last five years have proven this beyond a shred of doubt.</i><p>Sure, the economy has tanked but the main reason that happened is that pretty much all the economy was state funded. Once the state run out of money businesses started collapsing. That’s why we had a 30% drop in GDP while other EU countries that issued similar austerity programs faced far less GDP drop.<p>If you take a look at the top 10 biggest companies in Greece for example, most are either state owned or subsidiaries of multinational corporations. There isn’t a single privately owned company in Greece that makes more than a billion in sales annually.<p>I’m not a great fan of the austerity measures but I won’t argue that it’s the root of all our problems. The root of our problems is the model of our economy and there’s better chances we solve it inside EU than on our own.",1435521438

Which is to say, crazy religious zealots are a large fraction of the homeschoolers, but not representative of the homeschooled people you and I meet.<p>Incidentally, I was briefly homeschooled with no impact on my academic career.",1435521432

The ECB/IMF did it because Greece was part of the Eurozone so they were obligated to in order to preserve the strength of the coalition. I believe most investors would be extremely wary of placing any money into Greece post-default. And huge investments are exactly what the country needs to enact structural reform.<p>Also, The problem with creating a new currency is that no one will have any reason to trust that the government will be able to back it with real economic value. If Greece were to come out with a new brand of money, say the &quot;Greco&quot;, I would be extremely suspicious of holding any for fear of hyperinflation/a new currency coming out in 3 years to replace the debts taken on in Greco.",1435521140

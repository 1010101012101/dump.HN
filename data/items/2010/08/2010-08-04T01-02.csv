They passed up on running their own online store -- outsourcing it to Amazon, but worse they bet big on selling media merchandise at their stores (DVDs, CDs, Games). I am sure originally the media decision worked, but as CDs died out (and DVD sales are dropping off), they were screwed.<p>Barnes & Noble on the other hand went with their own online store and bet bigger on having their own publishing arm (plus a college textbooks biz). Obviously in the longer run this has worked out but they are still facing extinction. I imagine that bookstores will still continue to exist going forward, but they will be far fewer in numbers akin to record stores. My guess is that Ron Burkle was going to make a play for the whole company so Riggio had to quickly react with his own potential offer (note the language he used in the press release).<p>Some people will try to play up the store real estate value aspect of these companies but I think that is not a good angle. Borders / B&N have -huge- stores on a sqft basis. That presents a big problem for potential businesses looking to purchase a location. I think the stores are most appropriate for maybe furniture stores but those are still recovering from tough times during the crisis. I don't expect them to start investing any time soon.",1280884972

Plugging known holes is the minimum standard;  otherwise you will be compromised in days if not hours.<p>the vast majority of malicious activity is completely automated, each compromised system being used to compromise other systems.   This means that there is a truly staggering number of attackers, and that you will be attacked even if you have nothing of value to take.<p>this is why watching the security mailing lists for your software is important; even a weekly upgrade schedule may not be enough.<p>The rest of the sysadmin jazz, eliminating unused programs and stuff like that are really shortcuts to reducing the number of programs who's security problems are your problems.   There are holes we don't know about in everything, so the fewer programs you depend on not having holes, the better off you are.<p>It's good practice to sit there with 'ps' and google and figure out what every process  does and how the system responds when a process is killed  (especially important if you are on a linux box with an aggressive overcommit and not enough swap, and thus oom-killer issues.)",1280884947

So far I'm loving it and it only took a total of 4 days (including Sat and Sun) from setup of the business checking to first dollar processed. And the monthly cost isn't much at all (covered by 1 or 2 subscriptions).<p>Here are some points I learned along the way:

There are many hoops to jump through, and they help speed the process.<p>-You'll probably need to include the CIM (customer information manager) feature of Authorize.net  to support recurring payments. It is an additional $20/mo, but it eliminates the need to store data (read: no PCI headaches).<p>-It is a lot easier if you already have a site up and running, because they are going to verify things like cancellation and refund policies, terms of service and contact info.<p>I'll be selling mostly to corporate buyers, so Paypal Payments Standard wasn't an option. Payments Pro may have worked, but I had heard some horror stories about funds being frozen, etc. So, I decided to go the ""difficult"" route and setup a real merchant account.

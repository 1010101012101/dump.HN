263992,comment,263891,263891,0,0,softwarejim,,,"The assumption that your choice is a binary one is silly.  Its never either/or.  Its always both.<p>The first product you build are in a client driven business structure where they are telling you what and how to build it.  Then if you do that well enough, you can transform yourself into a product business.",1217599043
263991,comment,263648,263648,0,0,shimon,,,"The desire to store generated energy for use at a different time isn't limited to solar cells or other day-only sources.  A similar problem is posed by the fact that conventional power stations have a fixed maximum throughput, but demand is much higher during the day.<p>To balance the load and maximize revenue, a number of power producers employ a decidedly low-tech way to store energy: every night, they pump a lake of water up a mountain, and during the day they drain it through hydroelectric generators.<p>Really!  I shit you not:

Our happiness doesn't have much relationship to our financial status.<p>So perhaps it would have cheered her up to donate half of it to a charity operating in the third world. $500,000 will buy a whole lot of anti-malarial medication, mosquito netting, goats, and microloans.",1217597458

It's on her site SmartNow, which in the bio says: ""She founded SmartNow.com last year to help women help themselves.""

263977,comment,263443,263594,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Funny that with all that (decades of success and one public fiasco), she still wasn't happy.  That's a great lesson that all the success in the world made her overweight and with a crumbling marriage, but a humiliating public crash caused her to find herself and joy in life.  I wish her the best, and it sounds like she's going to get it.",1217597144

It's interesting, that similarly how Western media painted a distorted picture of Soviet communist regime, they now paint a distorted picture of China communist regime.

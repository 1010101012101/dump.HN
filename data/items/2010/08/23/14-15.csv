If you do need that so much, maybe a different language would be better: Scala maybe, or C/C++ or Java. (can't speak for Clojure and the others).<p>A good programmer needs a good set of tools. Matz (Ruby's creator) tried to make Ruby as nice to code in as possible, and personally it's great for that. I keep going back to Ruby whenever I need to write glue code for my main number crunching stuff (which is in Fortran normally).<p>I think that's Ruby's niche to be honest. RoR was a fortuitous event, but if the Ruby community would one day put speed before convenience, that will be the day Ruby's raison d'etre would be lost. As for the RoR community I think RoR open the eyes to a lot of people, but if you are a web programmer, and you need speed so badly, there's now (or so I hear) similar frameworks on other systems.

I need some of that!"" Similar arguments have also been made for trying Meth and the like, that you just <i>have</i> to experience it! No thanks. I also don't buy the whole ""You need pain to experience happiness"", but I haven't formulated an eloquent knockdown argument against that yet. While it's true pain and pleasure are related through endorphins, my idea of happiness isn't constant orgasm. I've wondered if these arguments for pain could simply be using an overly broad definition of pain that includes any struggle or conflict, any challenge or exercise... Being for death, especially if you're an atheist, is just ludicrous.<p>Anyway, I can also imagine being very not-bored in such a different world that knows no pain nor death for very many years, longer than any lifetime any human has yet had. I can imagine that in that world where life is valued oh-so-high, that people are constantly at work to increase it, to let people live even just one more day. I can imagine learning for the sake of learning and creating for the sake of creating, I can imagine doing those things for other ends as well, some selfish, some not.<p>The brain pattern making up ""you"" is fairly unique, and it's such a sad shame, a true shame, that so many patterns have already been annihilated even before a mere 75 years have passed. There may be nothing <i>out there</i> that says your matter's state is worth preserving, but there is definitely something <i>in here</i>. In human brains. Unfortunately our brains were built by the ancestral environment, not by any benevolent being, and thus we have certain problems such as this contradiction of sometimes believing death and pain are things acceptable, even good, yet nonetheless having a very strong aversion to death and pain. I think the aversion is the saner part of our minds.",1282574995

Those drivers cause all of the traffic problems I see.  They likely contribute to many of the accidents as well.  They will end up leaving huge gaps in front of them at the expense of traffic behind them even when traffic ahead of them is moving smoothly and quickly.<p>The cost of letting cell phone drivers in front of you can be many minutes to your commute per each driver.  Add a few minutes for each traffic light or merge lane that you will spend behind the inattentive drivers.<p>In a 5 mile commute, following the flow of inattentive drivers can add 45 minutes to my drive.  Attentive driving and following the flow of other ""aggressive"" drivers can make it a 10 minute drive total.<p>So what I have actually found helps, in a real world scenario, not a fictional one where all drivers are equal, is trying to identify and cooperate with other ""aggressive"" drivers helps the group of aggressive drivers get through traffic efficiently and gives the cell-phone drivers plenty of time to concentrate on their conversations.",1282574823

It either rains or it doesn't and I want to know exactly which and nobody will figure out how to do so anytime soon. While I'm at it I will throw the human genome at you as well. Big pharma was promising untold breakthroughs once we figured out the stuff people are made from but the results have been unspectacular since cancer incidence and whatever other incidence you can think of has been steady and even increasing. The only time big pharmacy companies made any breakthroughs were when they were trying to figure out something and accidentally figured out something else or invented some condition, ADHD anyone?

I can't tell what city you're servicing right away, I had to search for the tiny address at the bottom of your homepage (NY I take it).  You should make it very obvious where you're targeting right now. Maybe put the address in the hero section where you have the other event details, and perhaps provide an embedded google map too.<p>2. This is a minor design issue, but your main logo pushes your hero section down almost 200px.  I would tighten things up a bit, but that's just me.<p>3. Design again: get a good designer to help you with your typography. If you're DIYing your design, look into grid systems, your alignments are headache inducing.<p>Where is your revenue coming from?  Are the venues paying a fee for the potential of foot traffic?<p>Also, what would stop me from creating a similar service which simply queried Foursqure, Twitter, Facebook, Gowalla, etc. for location info and providing deals based on how many people checked in? It would essentially just be a deals site that functions on check-in services: you advertise a deal, you negotiate with the venue, and all people need to do is show that they checked in with one of those services.<p>Good work so far, though!",1282574387

My experiences don't line up with a lot of the speculation I see in this thread.<p>* Most speed gains come from hunt-and-peck QWERTY typists learning true touch typing for the first time.

(On typists who were trained correctly from day one, QWERTY has always been just as fast as alternative layouts, hence its market success.)<p>* I find Dvorak really is vastly more comfortable.  I have RSI problems.  The working day is a constant battle against pain and fatigue.  I can type longer without fatigue using Dvorak than QWERTY.<p>* The ""switching"" problem is real.  It only took me about three days to learn Dvorak well enough to regain my original QWERTY typing speed.  It took almost two years to be able to switch between Dvorak and QWERTY at will, without resorting to hunt and peck.  These days, I can could easily switch mid-sentence.<p>* The keyboard shortcuts problem is pretty much bullshit.  I found that my muscle memory moved with the letters.  One-handed ctrl X/C/V only mattered when I was typing with the wrong hand.  (e.g. typing on the left side of the keyboard with my right hand.)

During that period, I switched between QWERTY and DVORAK a lot. The program DVAssist made it easy to switch it using a simple function key<p>3) For those who have problems using Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V, you can use Ctrl-Ins and Shift-Ins respectively. I find it much easier<p>4) If you need to use Dvorak on another computer, I have created an on the fly javascript program to do that on <a href=""http://www.electronizer.com/dvorak.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.electronizer.com/dvorak.html</a> (Note : It only works on IE)<p>I personally find the Dvorak keyboard more comfortable to type with. I have an RSI problem which I thought was due to the QWERTY, however, after getting to my peak speed in Dvorak, the problem started coming back, thus I am actually trying to slow my speed (I am contemplating being a 2 finger typist instead).<p>I reckon the problem with RSI and keyboard is not due to the keyboard layout, but more in the positioning of the keyboard when typing. To elaborate, I noticed people tend to centre their keyboards and align it to their body, this has the problem where the right hand has to over extend to type because of the numeric keypad placed on the right side of the keyboard. Couple this with the fact that the mouse is on the right hand side on most people's keyboard, this makes the right hand move more. An observation I noted was that people tend to move the wrist and not the entire hand.<p>To combat RSI, I have adopted the following<p>1) Align the keyboard ""G"" to align with the centre of my body (or the centreline as Wing Chun practitioner calls it). This enables both hands to extend to the same length.<p>2) Move the elbow and less of the wrist (whole forearm movement, another of Wing Chun's principle of using the whole arm)<p>3) Use the mouse with the left hand (easier done for me as I am a left hander) and the number pad with the right hand<p>My motivation for switching to Dvorak was to combat RSI and to prove that I can change a habit of 20 years.<p>If you are a 2 finger typist, I don't recommend switching to Dvorak. If you are switching for RSI, my experience is that it doesn't work. If you switch to Dvorak, you might miss out on a cool technology for mobile phones called Swype.

If you take Haskell, Ocaml, Go, Java, C#, Common Lisp, Factor and so forth, the speed increase is much lower since these languages <i>are</i> fast by themselves. Thus, the barrier of having to rewrite and <i>maintain</i> a C-implementation at the side is as high, and there is no fruit-tree on the other side of the barrier you can reap.<p>Languages in which CPU-intensive work is fairly expensive are the ones which benefits the most from a C-rewrite. Ruby is <i>notoriously</i> slow in that regard, which makes it a prime candidate for such a rewrite. And before people scold me: Synthetic benchmarks, like the alioth shootout:<p><a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/which-programming-languages-are-fastest.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/which-programming-lang...</a><p>is a good indicator of exactly the CPU-intensive power of a given language.

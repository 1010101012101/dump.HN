10070549,comment,10069748,10069748,0,0,EliRivers,,,"My previous employer (a subdivision of a global top ten defence company) used literate programming.<p>The project I worked on was a decade-long piece for a consortium of defence departments from various countries. We wrote in objective-C, targeting Windows and Linux. All code was written in a noweb-style markup, such that a top level of a code section would look something like this:<p><pre><code>    <<Initialise hardware>>
    <<Establish networking>>
</code></pre>
and so on, and each of those variously break out into smaller chunks<p><pre><code>    <<Fetch next data packet>>
    <<Decode data packet>>
    <<Store information from data packet>>
    <<Create new message based on new information>>
</code></pre>
The layout of the chunks often ended up matching functions in the source code and other such code constructs, but that wasn&#x27;t by design; the intention of the chunks was to tell a sensible story of design for the human to understand. Some groups of chunks would get commentary, discussing at a high level the design that they were meeting.<p>Ultimately, the actual code of a bottom-level chunk would be written with accompanying text commentary. Commentary, though, not like the kind of comments you put <i>inside</i> the code. These were sections of proper prose going above each chunk (at the bottom level, chunks were pretty small and modular). They would be more a discussion of the purpose of this section of the code, with some design (and sometimes diagrams) bundled with it. When the text was munged, a beautiful pdf document containing all the code and all the commentary laid out in a sensible order was created for humans to read, and the source code was also created for the compiler to eat. The only time anyone looked directly at the source code was to check that the munging was working properly, and when debugging; there was no point working directly on a source code file, of course, because the next time you munged the literate text the source code would be newly written from that.<p>It worked. It worked well. But it demanded discipline. Code reviews were essential (and mandatory), but every code review was thus as much a design review as a code review, and the text and diagrams were being reviewed as much as the design; it wasn&#x27;t enough to just write good code - the text had to make it easy for someone fresh to it to understand the design and layout of the code.<p>The chunks helped a lot. If you had a chunk you&#x27;d called <<Initialise hardware>>, that&#x27;s all you&#x27;d put in it. There was no sneaking not-quite-relevant code in. The top-level design was easy to see in how the chunks were laid out. If you found that you couldn&#x27;t quite fit what was needed into something, the design needed revisiting.<p>It forced us to keep things clean, modular and simple. It meant doing everything took longer the first time, but at the point of actually writing the code, the coder had a really good picture of exactly what it had to do and exactly where it fitted in to the grander scheme. There was little revisiting or rewriting, and usually the first version written was the last version written. It also made debugging a lot easier.<p>Over the four years I was working there, we made a number of deliveries to the customers for testing and integration, and as I recall they never found a single bug (which is not to say it was bug free, but they never did anything with it that we hadn&#x27;t planned for and tested). The testing was likewise very solid and very thorough (tests were rightly based on the requirements and the interfaces as designed), but I like to think that the literate programming style enforced a high quality of code (and it certainly meant that the code did meet the design, which did meet the requirements).<p>Of course, we did have the massive advantage that the requirements were set clearly, in advance, and if they changed it was slowly and with plenty of warning. If you&#x27;ve not worked with requirements like that, you might be surprised just how solid you can make the code when you know before touching the keyboard for the first time exactly what the finished product is meant to do.<p>Why don&#x27;t I see it elsewhere? I suspect lots of people have simply never considered coding in a literate style - never knew it existed.<p>If forces a change to how a lot of people code. Big design, up front. Many projects, especially small projects (by which I mean less than a year from initial ideas to having something in the hands of customers) in which the final product simply isn&#x27;t known in advance (and thus any design is expected to change, a lot, quickly) are probably not suited - the extra drag literate programming would put on it would lengthen the time of iterative periods.<p>It required a lot of discipline, at lots of levels. It goes against the still popular narrative of some genius coder banging out something as fast as he can think it. Every change beyond the trivial has to be reviewed, and reviewed properly. All our reviews were done on the printed PDFs, marked up with pen. Front sheets stapled to them, listing code comments which the coder either dealt with or, in discussion, they agreed with the reviewer that the comment would be withdrawn. A really good days&#x27; work might be a half-dozen code reviews for some other coders, and touching your own keyboard only to print out the PDFs. Programmers who gathered a reputation for doing really good thorough reviews with good comments and the ability to critique people&#x27;s code without offending anyone&#x27;s precious sensibilities (we&#x27;ve all met them; people who seem to lose their sense of objectivity completely when it comes to their own code) were in demand, and it was a valued and recognised skill (being an ace at code reviews should be something we all want to put on our CVs, but I suspect a lot of employers basically never see it there)  - I have definitely worked in some places in which, if a coder isn&#x27;t typing, they&#x27;re seen as not working, so management would have to be properly on board. I don&#x27;t think literate programming is incompatible with the original agile manifesto, but I think it wouldn&#x27;t survive in what that seems to have turned into.",1439765249

My experiences have told me that the world of traveling is restricted to those with the right passports, i.e., North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and a few other countries considered privileged. If your passport is from the wrong country, like mine, throughout your travels, you&#x27;ll come across incredible barriers irrespective of how much money you have.  You&#x27;ll constantly be reminded that you don&#x27;t &quot;belong&quot; in the club of travelers.<p>If you have travelled to enough different countries, (60 for me and counting), you will have several instances of being detained by immigration, yelled at by consular officers, beaten up by border guards, have your passport flung at your face by police, and several such adventures. The fact that you went to great lengths to get the right visa papers (which could involve filling lengthy forms divulging every aspect of your finances and your life till date and wait months for a decision granting you permission to visit a country for a week) doesn&#x27;t count. The fact that you have a PhD from a US university doesn&#x27;t count. The fact that you have a great job at a fortune 5 firm in silicon valley doesn&#x27;t count. The fact that you make a high income and have a lot of savings doesn&#x27;t count.<p>In fact these could count against you, because immigration / consular officers will think someone with your passport is obviously making it up.

Writing the story after it&#x27;s done is too late - the business value is in the product&#x27;s shipped functionality, not in the development artifacts.<p>We have an alternate method of understanding how software developed, which is to look at revision control commits. This method falls more in line with the techniques of development and the genuine evolution of the codebase. Recall that revision control methods were still being improved well after Knuth wrote about literate programming, and the available systems, where people used them(and a lot of shops didn&#x27;t), weren&#x27;t nearly as fine-grained back in the 1980&#x27;s.<p>Personal experience: I tried using &quot;Leo&quot;, an outlining and literate programming text editor, for a project.

The time I spent on the documentation could have gone - from my current perspective - into making the code smaller and simpler.

And I only aimed to critique that post&#x27;s reasoning, not the conclusions it made.<p>As for imperfect competition (which I&#x27;m also familiar with, I have a PhD in economics), I see you mentioned it above but I still don&#x27;t know why.  Even if not sellers were a monopoly or oligopoly, everything I said above would apply, at least in very broad terms.  You could probably come up with some demand function such that increasing input costs of a monopolistic producer resulted in an increase in production, but I don&#x27;t see why you would think that actually applied here.",1439762775

Even <i>before</i> yesterday&#x27;s article about Amazon being a &quot;bruising workplace&quot;, they ran numerous articles about Amazon and book publishers renegotiating their contracts and the stories were always biased towards the publishers.<p>-- articles from Wall Street Journal and Harvard Business Review are not as negative.  Unfortunately, they have smaller circulation numbers, and their articles are more heavily blocked behind paywalls.  Their articles are not as widely accessible and therefore not as easy to share.  As far as &quot;dictating the narrative&quot; and &quot;shaping public perception&quot; about Amazon employees, NYT drowns out WSJ & HBR.<p>-- the readership for NYT (more workers) is different from WSJ & HBR (more managers).  Therefore, articles about sweatshop pressure at warehouses and white-collar burnout in the corporate offices will resonate with NYT readers.  Even if the senior editors at NYT privately don&#x27;t favor bashing Amazon repeatedly, one can&#x27;t blame them for always running the stories because they know what their readers like.  In the comments section, NYT readers continue the pile on of scorn.  It&#x27;s the same situation with NYT running negative articles about Marissa Mayer at Yahoo and her &quot;unfair&quot; personal baby daycare, eliminating remote workers, etc.<p>The negative effects at Amazon mentioned by NYT <i>can be true</i> while simultaneously, employees like Tim Bray don&#x27;t experience it.  However, NYT is not interested in running a story that interviews a bunch of &quot;Tim Brays&quot;.",1439762730

I showed that the number of votes a Hacker News story gets is correlated with the time it is submitted. Then, I told you that submitting your story at a particular time will cause it to have a higher chance of success. Correlation does not imply causation, however, so this is unproven. It is entirely possible that stories submitted on the weekend have simply been better than those submitted on weekdays, or that weekend readers are “vote-happy”. However, my intuition suggests to me that it is most likely that there is true causation here.</i><p>You probably should have <i>led</i> with that caveat.

Certainly there is something physical going on which we call a &quot;discovery&quot; or an &quot;invention&quot;, but it gets fuzzier the more you look at it.<p>We can objectively say that 1492 was an important year of first contact and we should talk about what happened. But it wasn&#x27;t &quot;discovering the New World&quot; from the Native Americans&#x27; point of view.<p>Both in science and math, publishing a paper can be an important event and it&#x27;s a physical process. But the first math paper published may not correspond to the first time someone had an idea or made an observation.

The article is a little bit overboard, didn&#x27;t see anyone cry at AWS for instance. But overall the general impression is accurate. There&#x27;s many ways to compare and contrast between the two. Amazon really cares about the customer to an extent I haven&#x27;t seen at other places. And Google really cares about their employees. Google prides itself on being deliberate to a fault when it comes to hiring while Amazon is a hiring machine, but both have equally high standards. Both pay well, I would say Google is better than Amazon primarily because they don&#x27;t try to cap your stock grants to a total comp number, but you&#x27;re not going to get rich in either place if you join now.",1439762468

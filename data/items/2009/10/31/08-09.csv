In the relatively unlikely case a court held the contract valid, I could shed it in bankruptcy.<p>The downside case is much better with the ""3% equity in a person"" investment than a student loan.",1256979213

That is, I didn't expect this to be related to telecomms in any way.<p>... and now that we're on the topic of strange subjects involving telecommunications, I've managed to distract myself by listening to recordings of numbers stations again.",1256979088

913389,comment,913374,913374,0,0,DarkShikari,,,"This sounds similar to the basic idea behind the psy optimizations used in the Vorbis encoder: the ear expects to hear something rather than nothing in a given frequency band, so it's better to play back noise in that band instead of playing nothing at all.  In other words, energy preservation is more important than mere accuracy.<p>Of course, in this case, the logic is being applied to the audio stream as a whole, not just individual frequency bands.  Since the voice activity detection is removing background noise, the lack of energy in the audio stream seems odd to the brain, so the noise has to be added to compensate.<p>The same seems to apply in dealing with images and video: the eye notices a <i>lack of detail</i> (blurring) more than it notices <i>inaccurate</i> detail.",1256978901

Well since you are mentioning Tango, it's unfair because he writes code for a _standard_library_. And he is writing a good code.",1256978490

If you ask a C++ user, he wouldn't drop C++ and a damn lots of libraries, IDE's, debuggers and industry support for it. I recently talked to my C++ friend writing scientific multithreaded stuff, and he was only convinced by D2.<p>Templates are the killer feature of D. There is nothing wrong in the emphasis on them.<p>Yes I agree that there are problems in D2. But there are much more problems in D1.<p>If I were you, I wouldn't do such an anti-advertisement campaign here. Instead you could have pointed at what you think are the problems with D2. That would be more constructive.",1256977793

That might not be your cup of tea, but it's far from hard.</i><p>In addition to privacy issues (many individuals don't approve of logging of what they perceive to be ephemeral 'hallway' conversations), there's the simple fact that these types of conversation don't lend themselves to well thought out messages -- as you noted with: ""you can't really 'write up' something in IRC the way that you can compose an email.""<p><i>Why not create a web forum/usenet/mailinglist gateway?</i><p>I'm sure nobody would object if you did -- Jive Forums (when the product still existed[1]) used to support both web-based and NNTP-based access.<p>[1] Jive Software was profitable[2] and engineering focused, and Jive Forums was a great product. They had both large and small customers, ranging from Amazon,  Apple, and EA to numerous small businesses that required quality collaboration software -- jabber, forums, etc.<p>Then they took a massive, unnecessary $15 million investment from Sequoia Capital in 2007, hired a Chief Marketing Officer, completely fouled up their product line in ""simplifying"" it, and wound up having to raise another $12 million in series B funding in 2009 to keep the now-bloated machine running. They had to lay off a (reported) third of their staff in 2008 (but kept the 'CMO' position).<p>Waste of a good company with a solid set of collaboration products and a solid engineering team. Trimming down their product lines and raising their prices has left them out of reach of SMBs, and the ""one size fits all"" product completely ignores this straight-forward e-mail/forums/web problem space.<p>It also leaves a large market opportunity for someone to write a forums system that doesn't suck -- a surprising number of large corporations are still slaved to Jive Software's increasingly hefty licensing fees.<p>[2] <a href=""http://www.jivesoftware.com/jivespace/community/jivetalks/blog/2007/08/22/more-on-our-15m-funding-round-with-sequoia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jivesoftware.com/jivespace/community/jivetalks/bl...</a><p><i>Why did we raise the money?</i><p><i>Since the beginning, we have had a vision of open collaboration and how it can fundamentally transform the way a company works. Now the market is starting to agree with that vision and is seeing the benefits. We're proud of how we have grown this business over the last six years. We've been profitable since inception and have put good money in the bank. We have made our share of mistakes and missteps, but we haven't sacrificed our values and ultimately those mistakes made us stronger and smarter. This year we struck a mighty vein with Clearspace when we launched in February. Now the growth is in high gear and bringing on a funding partner is a step towards becoming the provider of choice in the market.</i>",1256976361

What I'm having a hard time with is understanding precisely where it fits after having read through all the public docs.  Despite the comparisons drawn on the intro page, Traffic Server seems close to squid and varnish functionally, but really only close to squid in actual implementation: a highly configurable split ram/disk caching proxy.  Varnish is quite a departure from this approach (<a href=""http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/ArchitectNotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://varnish.projects.linpro.no/wiki/ArchitectNotes</a>), and nginx at its core is not a caching proxy at all.  This doesn't diminish its value as a system that's served tremendous traffic volumes over the last decade, but I'd love a more complete description of why I should choose TS over the alternatives in caching and reverse proxy roles.",1256976139

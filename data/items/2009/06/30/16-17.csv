Humans are waiting 2-3 years for a hip replacement; dogs are waiting <i>one week</i>. We're way past ""experimentation"".<p>I really don't know what you're imagining with all this talk of ""human guinea pigs"" etc. We're not talking about some crazy experimentation with live subjects, companies with <i>carte blanche</i> to do what they will. We're talking about new remedies, with high success rates in (genetically very similar) animals, which really need to be investigated.<p><i>""Am I correctly understanding your system of ethics where you are saying that choosing to do nothing = doing harm?""</i><p>Your examples are all biased. If you really do have the ability to apprehend an armed robber with no risk to yourself, then of course you should. The Africa situation is complex and it's not a matter of money but if you could really press a button and just fix it all, of course you'd be derelict in your duty if you didn't press that button.<p>The problem is the government isn't doing ""nothing"", it's actively retarding progress. I wish they <i>would</i> do nothing.<p>You seem to have this image in your head of some kind of large scale Nazi medical experimentation or something. I assure you that is not the case, and not what I am talking about. It is illegal to even <i>research</i> this shit, even if it works fine in animals, even if the patient is desperate and willing to take the risk.<p>The government is actively impeding this research and, by extension, medical progress. This is abhorrent and needs to change. Luckily, other countries are picking up the torch and soon you may indeed see sick Americans heading overseas for the treatment they need as America slides further into a complacent abyss of risk-averse stagnation.",1246381146

Ten years ago a lot of people would have told you that you <i>need</i> central control of code and full-time work from paid developers in a central office with careful managerial oversight to build powerful software. And all those people, many of them ""experts,"" were laughably wrong.<p>I think the concept of designing for usability has just been slower to enter the FOSS world. Only now are open source projects starting to grapple with how you do interaction design on a open source project. But throwing up our hands and assuming it will never happen just because it doesn't always happen right now is silly. How about we start recruiting non-developers to open source projects to run simple usability tests and report on their findings? It's not that developers will never work on usability, it's just that it's a difficult and foreign field to most of us, so we avoid the issue altogether.",1246380307

CDS = Credit Default Swaps, not Credit Derivative Swaps. All it takes is putting CDS into Google, five seconds tops.<p>I also take issue with the fact that the unconcern for subprime risk was the insurance--that ignores the risk model they had that showed real estate value going up. They didn't care if subprime defaulted because they'd get the property which would be worth more than the note and they'd make even more money. They knew the gig would be up if the CDS had to be executed en masse, they just didn't think that would ever need to happen.

681048,comment,680869,680869,0,0,frodwith,,,"At least for me, usability isn't the point of free software.  I want my free software to be usable, yes, and usability should be a goal for the development teams, but the overriding benefit of free software is that it is free.  It puts the power back in my hands as an end user.  Even if I don't have the technical skills to make use of that freedom, the freedom is important.  This is something that ""closed-source"" applications don't have.  If Microsoft made Office free tomorrow and it were easier to use than OpenOffice (it is, though that isn't saying much), I'd use it.  But Microsoft Office has vendor lock-in problems and platform compatibility issues, and I'm not free to make it better.  If people value usability over freedom, that is their choice.

Tech savvy ones would be more likely to join, and as it becomes more and more inviting I think the less savvy will join as well.

The gin part is interesting, but more interesting is that use of programming techniques based on knowing the type of memory in use to time instructions correctly.<p>&quot;In ultrasonic memories, it was customary to store up to 32 words end to end in the same delay line. The pulse rate was fairly high, but people were much worried about the time spent in waiting for the right word to come around. Most delay line computers were, therefore, designed so that, with the exercise of cunning, the programmer could place his instructions and numbers in the memory in such a way that\nthe waiting time was minimized. Turing himsdf was a pioneer in this type of logical design. Similar methods were later applied to computers which used a magnetic drum as their memory and, altogether, the subject of optimum coding, as it was called, was a flourishing one. I felt that this kind of human ingenuity was misplaced as a long-term investment, since sooner or later we would have truly random-access memories. We therefore did not have anything to do with optimum coding in Cambridge.<p>Although a mathematician, Turing took quite an interest in the engineering side, of computer design. There was some discussion in 1947 as to whether a cheaper substance than mercury could not be found for use as an ultrasonic delay medium. Turing&#x27;s contribution to this discussion was to advocate the use of gin, which he said contained alcohol and water in just the right proportions to give a zero temperature coefficient of propagation velocity at room temperature&quot;",1372420609

I think the large part which you are missing is that in Scala, everything is a library, there are no privileged operations or data structures:<p>In Scala, you have a huge set of options available which can be used where appropriate. There was a talk by the creators of Akka recently, and the most important message of their talk was pick your poison.<p>It&#x27;s not like in Go where people claim that channels and goroutines are the solution to every problem or how the Clojure community treats STM/Agents.<p>In a sense, this also shows the maturity of Scala&#x27;s developers and ecosystem, because they don&#x27;t claim that X or Y is the ultimate solution to everything.<p>- Scala has a full range of immutable & persistent as well as mutable & concurrent data structures available. In general, they are faster and more efficient than the ones in Clojure, due to the heavy tuning they received and the fact that you can pick the implementation which has the best performance characteristics for your use-case.<p>- The collection library supports data-parallel operations since 2.9, but I think it&#x27;s great that Clojure tries to catch up!<p>- Additionally, Scala offers a standardized Future&Promises implementation, as well as support for async blocks (also a libraray feature) in the upcoming version.<p>- On top of that, you can use java.util.concurrent or any other Java-based concurrency package without any impedance mismatch, like Netty.<p>- If necessary, you can also drop down to things like Threads, Locks, Queues, synchronization, @volatile variables or sun.mis.Unsafe.<p>- Actors offer solutions for higher-level concerns of concurrency, like distributed computation, failure tolerance and communication over unreliable networks.\n(I think the best question whether you need Actors is: Is there a chance that message X never reaches the receiver? If the answer is no, there is pretty much no point in using actors.) (There are currently some improvements under-way to make sure that no state can be accidentally captured in Actors, Futures, etc.)<p>- In addition to that you also have things like the Akka Dataflow libraries, Rx-style approaches or functional reactive programming.<p>- You can also use the STM library (or agents, ...) if it is the best tool for the job (most concurrency people in Scala say that STM is conceptually a dead-end though).<p>I hope the explanation helps a bit!",1372420468

5957427,comment,5956090,5956846,3,0,drawkbox,,,"Yes indeed I have worked on 2 but they were the longest, most un-rewarding experiences I have had. You can read my bio and probably figure out which games. Web, mobile and desktop games have been more fun and had less hurdles and were much cheaper to get launched.  No TRCs, SPUs, devkits, rough/costly approvals that were hard to share in a game company and more (we had 3 PS3 and 2 Xbox devkits and lots of developers, so it was a pain point for testing).  PSGL/libGCM and an obscured version of OpenGL ES 1.0 is indeed a &#x27;custom opengl&#x27; on PS3. And yes XBox360 is stuck on dx9 version.<p>I have to say complaining about custom platforms then backing consoles is a strange vector to be on though. Have you made mobile/web/desktop games after console and really had a harder time? Also, if you were running a small studio which would you develop for considering the entry cost on console runs upwards of 50-100k just to get started? And you need to have a publisher on both platforms that take additional revenues since you won&#x27;t be able to launch 4+ titles a year to qualify as a publisher on the consoles. My guess is you&#x27;d be developing for open markets and platforms like mobile, web and PC.  You admit it takes more time, well I have yet to see a console game take less than a year minimum and meanwhile the longest mobile timeline has been 3-4 months. If you have 3-4 years of development would you rather launch 2-3 console games if that or 10-15 mobile/web/desktop titles with same resources? The risk on console games/markets today is immense.<p>Mobile, web and desktop games are extremely more approachable than console development and extremely more affordable (leading to more time spent on gameplay and fun). Even Mark Cerny who designed the PS4 acknowledged this and went with more x86 architecture and shared memory to get rid of the complaints of difficulty when building for the PS3 (<a href=""http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_playstation_4_with_mark_.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/191007/inside_the_play...</a>). PS4 will also allow self-publishing which will make it more affordable.  XBone, well, they&#x27;ll support publishers over developers it seems.",1372420441

5957413,comment,5951589,5953619,1,0,oleganza,,,"> So basically you say that the children must pay for the crimes of their ancestors far back in the past?<p>How do you derive this from my words? Children are created by adults who may use peaceful methods to raise them, or use violent methods.<p>If you support &quot;status quo&quot; you should equally support any status quo in any point in history. Be it slavery in 19th century, or catholic tortures in medieval times. Was slavery &quot;OK&quot; in your view because many people thought it was OK back then? It&#x27;s just a double standard. If it was morally okay before, it should be morally okay in every time in the history (from the point of view of the same observer, that is you or me).<p>About status quo: there are two ways to change any status quo. Voluntarily (via mutual agreement) or violently (the strongest wins). Every time you go to work you are changing status quo. You create wealth that did not exist yesterday. Or you fix things that got broken and would remain broken until you fix them. Typically you do it peacefully: by agreeing with everyone whom it might concern that they don&#x27;t mind doing what you do (and may even pay you for that). Now, imagine we agreed together that I do something useful to you for a payment. Everyone who is really concerned about such change in the universe is participating voluntarily and has no objection. But then comes a guy who calls himself a &quot;government&quot; and brings a thing called &quot;income tax&quot;. He now wants to change the status quo violently. Instead of providing us something of value and negotiating, he simply states &quot;since you produced something of value to each other, both of you now must pay me&quot;. And shows his gun.<p>In other words, if you use &quot;status quo&quot; as a moral principle, you create many more problems. You either have no moral stance whatsoever, so your argument self-destructs (e.g. if slavery was okay in 19th century and not okay in 21st, then you have no opinion on slavery per se). Or you have some moral stance, but then you need to come up with a theory why certain status quo is okay and some other is not.<p>My position: &quot;Why don&#x27;t we bring down weapons and discuss on equal grounds&quot;. Your position: &quot;No, lets keep those weapons as they seemingly solve my problems, and if you have objections you are probably being immoral and against children.&quot;<p>As you can see, if you are pointing government&#x27;s gun at me, it could never be <i>me</i> who is immoral because I have no power of objection. But it could be that the immoral guy is the one who proclaims what is good and forces people to follow him.",1372420159

[1]<p>In a functional language you are mostly passing around fairly pure concepts of data as lists and maps, and transforming and combining data between functions.  This data is standalone, and serialisable, and so easy to understand; a REPL-oriented environment means that code gets implemented incrementally, building from some inputs to the required result interactively, so everything gets some testing as it is developed.<p>The static types of this pure data probably wouldn&#x27;t be very interesting.<p>Compare with SQL - SQL lets you join and transform arbitrary tables using queries.

But Rails is and always has been Herokus bread and butter, and Rails isnt multi-threaded.<p>In fact a routing layer designed for non-blocking, evented, realtime app servers like Node and its ilk  a routing layer that assumes every dyno in a pool is as capable of serving a request as any other  is about as bad as it gets for Rails, where almost the opposite is true: the available dynos are perfectly snappy and the others, until they become available, are useless.

The result was that the party blew up in spectacular fashion at the next elections, unable to get the membership enthusiastic enough to put boots on the ground to run election activities, with a consequent massive drop in the polls, leading to a drop in funding, leading to extinction.<p>I was in the NSW branch and as a result of this mess became policy manager and tried to put in place  what we would call a crowd-sourced policy creation system.  But this was in the early 2000s, the Internet was still not entirely ubiquitous, and management in NSW decided that we had to do this thing on paper, not on the Web.  It was slow, painful, and I moved countries before getting to the end (and anyway, it was too little too late, the writing was on the wall).<p>All of that to say that I don&#x27;t think we can use the Australian Democrats as a counterexample for direct democracy.  They never really had the processes in place to give such a system a chance.  Today the story might very well be different if a direct democracy party was tried with a correct set up of tools to allow the rank and file a chance to meaningfully participate in policy creation.  I&#x27;ve often thought about trying to set one up on that basis, but since I live in a country now where I&#x27;m not even a citizen, I&#x27;ve never tried.",1372418700

Most other languages give you more a clean-slate view, where your own code is the only thing presented to you, at least by default.<p>I forget who said it, but I&#x27;ve heard a remark along the lines that, &quot;When I write PHP, I&#x27;ve got 3 or 4 web browser tabs open on the documentation. When I write Smalltalk, I&#x27;ve got 3 or 4 class browser windows open [on the implementation]&quot;, and this is my experience as well. I gradually learnt to write clear, concise and (hopefully) well organised code through osmosis by these means, and while it was a valuable experience for me, it also took a lot of time.<p>Having clear examples of small-scale idiomatic code (as in this book) might well be a big help in shortening the learning process.<p>Which just leaves the other end of the scale:<p>- How do we give good examples of code organisation in the large?<p>- How best can we integrate them in to some sort of learning path?<p>- How do we classify such examples according to the problem space they&#x27;re well suited for?

From what I understand, in the broadest possible strokes, &quot;concurrency&quot; means &quot;it doesn&#x27;t matter in what order the sequence of operations happens and how their execution is reshuffled as long as the dependency invariants are maintained&quot;.",1372417426

The politic tactics surrounding the story are an angle that their readers are interested in, and they have real consequences as well.  I think you&#x27;d have to consider all their coverage of the story as a whole to analyze their slant (which is Democratic, of course.)",1372417329

Static languages ensure type safety (which are uncovered in unit tests anyway) and to ensure this type safety, they need more information from you, the developer. Clojure allows you to write less code which, depending on who you talk to, equals faster development time.<p>Static languages are also usually faster, so I guess the tradeoff stands between raw performance and code size.<p>There are numerous succesfull projects using dynamic languages. Github, as far as I know, uses Ruby.",1372417250

It&#x27;s certainly not exhaustive research and is only a small insight into some sales numbers. But it does make a kind of intuitive sense.<p>Personally, if I play a game and see how its core game mechanics work then I am much less likely to purchase it.<p>A lot of my game purchases are impulsive  I see something cool in the trailer and want to try it. Once I&#x27;ve tried it I lose interest. Demos give me the opportunity to lose interest without purchasing the game.<p>When I know I really want to play a game all the way through I will always purchase it without trying the demo (if available). So in my limited gaming experience demos have never been a step to a sale.",1372417250

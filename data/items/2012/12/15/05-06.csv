4924707,comment,4921152,4921152,1,0,grogenaut,,,"Lots of sports analogies on here. I'll toss in mine. I've made a habit of trying new things and have gotten over the ""you look stupid when you start"" part. Skiing, Snowboarding, knitting, sewing, coaching, aussie rules. Everyone's a newb at some point. I have found that I compare myself to other skiiers / boarders a lot. But that is mainly a safety thing so I know if I should follow them down other parts of the mountain. So competitive but for a reason. I think I get more pissy about etiquette and safety, but generally from people who look like they should know better. 16 year old coming into the lift line at high speed, I see you. I'm a large large man, you're gonna get hurt if you hit me and I played college ball, I'm gonna make sure <i>I</i> don't get hit. Soooo... anyway. Unless you're trying to get ranked in real life, you're really just competing against yourself. You're the one who will decide if you have the time to put into whatever to be good enough to compete at a low national level. There are exceptions, but in sports you can use your brain and experience to make up for physical deficiencies. In Cerebral events you can use persistence and experience. And I've tailed off so Fin",1355551172

This is not the place to parse it out, but the key thing they have in common is the idea of a rapture, in which some chosen humans will be taken up and made one with the infinite while others will be left behind.<p>Poll Americans (most of whom are Christian). Close to half will tell you the end of the world and thus the rapture is going to happen <i>in their own lifetime</i>. Christians have been believing that the rapture was around the corner for literally the last 2000 years. Arrogant if you ask me.<p>It wouldn't be so bad if Kurzweil's dates didn't line up conveniently with his own mortality. He'll be around 97 at the time he's predicting the singularity will occur.<p>So combine that with the concept of a) eternal life, b) meeting your relatives in heaven (Kurzweil is planning to resurrect his dead father), and c) AI and post humans that are essentially godlike. Sure, Kurzweil will show you a bunch of exponential graphs to make it all seem so reasonable, but that's why Kapor says ""creationsim for the IQ 140 people.""<p>That's not optimism. It's wishful thinking. If you can't see that it has all the fundamentals of a religion, I'm not sure what else to say.<p>>An ambitious and unlikely goal, but it's not prohibited by the laws of physics<p>As far as I know, neither is God.",1355550221

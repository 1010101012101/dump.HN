I wind up just not communicating at all.<p>I also prefer to limit where my email address is posted online (obfuscated or not).<p>For serious things, email is generally worth it, but there still might be issues with spam filters or accidental deletions.",1181925355

There are tons of cool technical challenges and elegant solutions (creatively laying out video frames onto RTP to deal with high packet loss, for instance). Must be alot of fun to be a part of it.<p>One thing I don't get, however, is monetization strategy. Sell camera/software kits to Justing wannabees? License the tech to TV networks?

I can reproduce it in the Safari I have, but it's old (1.3.2). <p>Update: In fact it looks the site works fine in version 2 and later.",1181924024

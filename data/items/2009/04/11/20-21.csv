557816,comment,557728,557728,0,0,jonknee,,,"Summary: IBM consultant who could barely design a system that handles 18 million weekly transactions lets Twitter know what they need to do to ""scale"". His advice is IBM main frames. Probably Oracle too. Yes, this is still the year 2009.<p>This was a very weird article:<p>> I had just completed a project for a large government agency that needed a system that could accomplish approximately 5,500 database row inserts and reads per second, or approximately 18 million transactions per week.<p>Not even close--5,500 a second comes to over 3 billion weekly transactions. 18 million transactions is nothing, that can be handled on a VPS.<p>> And as a customer requirement, we had to do it with COMMODITY HARDWARE.<p>Here's his idea of commodity hardware:<p>> The heart of the “beast”, as those of us referred to it, was comprised of 4 Unisys ES7000-based Oracle 10g RAC nodes, each using 256GB of RAM and sixteen dual-core Intel Xeon processors, and the most sophisticated, high-performance Cisco 10Gbps Ethernet switching that money could buy which was available between all the main clustered and load balanced tiers of the system — Web, J2EE Application Servers, Messaging Queue and Database.<p>Probably a million dollars in hardware and it barely was able to do 18m weekly transactions. Now for his advice to Twitter:<p>> No, there’s only one systems architecture that will solve the Fail Whales once and for all. As much as I hate coming off like an IBM commercial — cue the blue background and jazz music on Tech Broiler — the solution to the Fail Whale is a Blue Whale — an IBM System Z. A Mainframe. Or two. Preferably in a SYSPLEX configuration.<p>""Enterprise"" people really grind my gears. Google started with servers in LEGO cases. Even today they just use tons of not very important hardware. The solution to scaling Twitter isn't throwing $2m to IBM, it's not trying to run it out of a RDBMS.<p>In the long run you won't be able to buy your way out of a shitty foundation.",1239483250

Bar associations are a guild whose main goal is to restrict supply by making it hard to become a lawyer. (Even still, the US has far more lawyers than it needs.) They exist pretty explicitly to keep legal salaries high.<p>Accreditation for colleges is much more, well, collegial. There's no big motivation to restrict supply. It's hard to think of any really good educational institutions that can't seem to get accredited for political reasons. The list of over 1000 accredited colleges in CA starts off:<p>* A-Technical College (LA)<p>* ABC Adult School (Cerritos)<p>* Abram Friedman Occupational Center (LA)<p>* Absolute Safety Training Paramedic Program (Oroville)<p>* Academy Education Services (Oxnard)<p>so it's not just the Stanfords that can manage accreditation.",1239483249
557814,comment,557772,557810,0,0,wizard_2,,,"The part that doesn't sit right with me is that Google never asked or told me that their software would run in the background as well as they never ask to install the updates when it does do its updates. I only know what it's doing because I monitor my network, cpu, and have growl alerts when volumes are mounted. I thought about it and decided not to stop it as I have no idea how else their software would be updated and I do want the updates. I just don't like how they went about it.<p>On windows Google Chrome does something similar, you don't even need administrative right to install chrome it sits in the application data area. It can update and operate all without explicit permission. It makes me a little wary.",1239483173

Something I've found out most people didn't even know existed, but I think it's a fairly new offering.

557806,comment,557446,557609,0,0,bbgm,,,"Thanks for saying what you just did.  Although my protein structure prediction days are far beyond me, cycles for projects like these are, for the most part, not going to result in major scientific advancement.  In most cases, they are a proof of concept, but you really can't do any production work using spare home computers.  Now research on accelerated hardware, new scale out programming models, better algos is all worth it.<p>I will disagree on the utility of figuring out a structure though and this is based on experience where there was always a dual component to research, which the prediction guiding, for example, site-directed mutagenesis experiments.  The computational design is a lot cheaper and can really help guide project direction.<p>And in the long run, there is nothing wrong with just understanding the physics of folding.  The problem is we really aren't there yet, but that doesn't mean we should stop",1239482027
557805,comment,557632,557632,0,0,yason,,,"Haven't they always provided free licenses for students but this single hub site is new? Or was the earlier offer the student pricing only? Can't remember. But it doesn't matter really.<p>What is interesting is that over the year I've begun to repeatedly see signs of that Microsoft is no more. This is just another one of those.<p>While I've been passively against Microsoft ever since 80's I've always considered them a credible opposing force to other stacks of software, such as FOSS or GNU, or Unix, or Macs. Eventhough I wasn't a Windows user I always knew what was new on the MS front, and what new features they would soon be selling.<p>However, these days I hardly bother to raise my eyebrow anytime Microsoft announces something. I think it started with, or at around the time of, the anticipation of Vista.<p>Vista was a bit everything and then quite much nothing: it didn't feel like a success and, indeed, now it seems that it never became a success either. This is not only because XP was deemed ""good enough"" but, to me, because Microsoft really hadn't figured out anything relevant to add to XP. They would have implemented it in Vista but it seems that since XP a Windows-like operating system had already reached a saturation point, both feature-wise and UI-wise. This means they must have stopped thinking about -- or run out of -- any juicy practical improvements in around 2000 or so: they still had something to be implemented in XP but then nothing much. People could run XP for a decade and they wouldn't miss anything important as long as they could install new versions of their browser.<p>Unlike Vista, Windows 7 will probably break the XP dam and flood over to everywhere around the world. However, this doesn't mean there's much substance to it except the sheer brute force ramming the foundations of the 8-or-9-year-old XP. It will take a few years to change (merely the name of) the de facto Windows operating system but as XP will begin to suffer from fundamental aging problems such as lack of drivers the transition will punch through. However, unless Windows 7 is a total blunder there will be absolutely nothing from Microsoft that would replace it for the following ten years or even longer. Microsoft has had a hard time with XP already and they now have one chance to do one more force-update and then they're stuck. I don't think it would be unimaginable for Windows 7 to be the last major operating system from Microsoft.<p>Similarly with IE: IE8 is better in many ways and delivers features that people have been waiting for since IE6. However, I didn't see people rejoicing together, queueing at stores, or slashdotting Microsoft's download site. IE8 is not a key player in the web browser market: it's just catching up. There's no disruptive energy behind IE8; people who have been fed up with IE6/IE7 have been using Firefox for years. IE8 doesn't make the difference anymore. IE7 and IE8 could just as well have been IE6.1 and IE6.2.<p>Now, the student licenses! Even no more than five years ago I would have got a grumpy face from thinking about the horde of freshmen that would get Microsoft stuff for free and learn to think of the world of computing as equal to MS Windows, MS Visual Studio, MS languages, and MS tools. Now I'm not worried at all, for some reason. I don't feel their student licenses changing anything in the world even if they offered them for negative price. The smart guys have been using Linux/BSD or OS X for years already, and everything important is cross-platform or on the web these days so that there's no single Microsoft solution that would be the de facto environment for most tasks. Perhaps I just exclusively know and read people who I consider smart and are in the non-MS camp, or I'm missing some other reality check here, but I'm not worrying about this DreamSpark thing. It will take off because Microsoft is huge and a like a tanker it takes miles to come to a full stop. But as for the bleeding edge where new things are tried, Microsoft isn't and won't be a major player. Rather, the DreamSpark thing feels like a one last stretch to level the playing field to their favor, and those kind of stunts are bound to fail per definition.<p>To exaggerate, Microsoft is effectively in the position as if they hadn't done or released anything after Windows XP. Not good. (For them, I mean. :))",1239482025

557797,comment,557659,557659,0,0,gamble,,,"Considering how often Canada is mentioned in this article, they don't dwell on why it was so much easier for the engineer and his wife to get into Canada. (A fate worse than death, apparently.)<p>The key difference between our systems is that Canada issues residency visas, not temporary work visas. Once you have your Canadian permanent residency visa you can work for any employer. Immigrants aren't shackled to a sponsor, so they don't have the same motivation as H1-Bs to accept below-market wages and working conditions.<p>In addition, the Canadian system is biased in favor of skilled workers. The vast majority of American immigrants are unskilled laborers allowed in through the 'family reunification' program. Canada does have a similar program, but the majority of our immigrants are skilled. There is even a fast-track classification for US H1-B holders.<p>The problem with the immigration debate in the US is that it's fundamentally dishonest. Employers lionize immigrants, but the last thing they want is a system that treats them fairly.",1239481689
557796,comment,556908,557626,0,0,bokonist,,,"Gatekeeper laws cost Americans hundreds of billions a year in tuition and lost wages.  It's also condemnable from a personal liberty perspective.  The burden of proof is entirely on the schools to show that the costs in money and liberty are worth it.  They have not done so.  Heck, there is no proof that even primary education is worth it.  Despite massive increases in enrollment, length of schooling, and school spending, overall rates of numeracy and vocabulary have been flat over the course of the 20th century.<p>Recently I was talking to friend who had just left law school.  He described the process as: ""We spend all semester in class where we listen to boring professors who just like to hear themselves talk.  Then we do internships where we get paid to learn.""  I have close friends in architecture school who say the same thing.   Almost all the practical stuff about code and structures students learn on the job.  The school teaches stuff like ""aura"" and deconstructionist design.   Compare the current Boston City Hall the Old Boston City Hall and you see the results of this wonderful, accredited training.  There is simply no evidence that law school or architecture school is a net positive, much less that is worth the cost.  (Medical school is a tougher case as care has improved.  But this seems to be the result of improvements in science and technology, not schooling).<p>I hear the same exact stories from people graduating other schools - education schools, meteorology programs, business school, etc.   It's pretty clear that the primary result of establishing an accreditation body as legal gatekeeper to a field, is to create jobs for professors and increase wages for professionals.  ( note - computer science classes tend to be more sound, perhaps precisely because there is no legal credentialing requirement to enter software programming, and thus the departments must prove their worth the old fashioned way)<p>If the purpose of credentialing laws was merely to protect consumers, the laws would only care about the results of the schools teaching ( whether graduates could past the Boards or the Bar ) rather than the process ( whether the school was accredited).   The law would also allow people to get around the defaults.  For instance, your web browser warns you when you access a potentially malicious site, but it still allows you to access it if you really want to.  But you cannot do the same with lawyers; you a non-accredited lawyer cannot represent you in court.<p>And even if school accreditation were a net lose, that doesn't mean accreditation in general is always a mistake-- that it's impossible to do right.<p>In the context of the American political system of 2008, it is impossible.  Washington does not work.  You can expect to make a reasonable policy suggestion, and have the actual result come be close to what you wanted.  The only thing we can do is keep the poison from spreading through Silicon Valley as long as we can.",1239481516

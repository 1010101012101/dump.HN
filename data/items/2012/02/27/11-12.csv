REPL-based, rather than an IDE.  Targetting HTML5 web browsers (maybe only one to start with?).  Social coding baked right in, so it'd be trivial to start projects, fork them, share gists, etc. etc.  And then the final step would be publishing to Heroku from within the REPL.<p>So, maybe start off with an in-browser REPL.  Add serialization of state.  Then plug that into GitHub.  Then some sort of deploy step to Heroku.  Lots and lots of keyboard accelerators, help goodness and a decent debugger.<p>But for the moment, it seems to be beyond my ability and / or beyond existing browser-based Lisp technologies.",1330343996

3638655,comment,3638591,3638591,18,0,chris_dcosta,,,"I congratulate them on acheiving your goal of writing an app in such a short time, but I whole-heartedly condemn this app's principle idea. Far from being a force for good it feeds into the incredible paranoia that seems to be prevail in the United States, that everyone is out to get them, and that there are such things as ""good areas"" and ""bad areas"".<p>There are huge problems in justifying this kind of classification, not least because ordinary law abiding citizens who are in a majority also live and work and play in so-called ""bad areas"" and never suffer crime. What becomes of their house values if such an irresponsible app were to become popular? Their (very) hard earned cash  paid as mortgage payments gone to waste.<p>This app is pernicious in every sense. Even wealthy well-to-do areas can become ghetto-ized: If you tally up the number of burglaries or attempted burglaries in these areas you might find the stats show a different image.<p>We are not living in some post-apolcolyptic movie world, this is real life and has hard working real people in it, with families and children, who have no choice but to live where they can afford to, and I don't see how this app could ever be considered as ""making the world a better place"". For who exactly?<p>This kind of app threatens to push people who live in the targeted areas further down the food chain, and I just wish the developers would have been a bit more socially responsible, in their thought processes.<p>Rant over. Hopefully a lesson learnt.",1330343936

3638638,comment,3638045,3638426,6,0,irahul,,,"On a related note, I generally simplify the implementation further:<p><pre><code>    P(spam/doc) = P(w1/spam) * P(w2/spam) * ... * P(wn/spam)\n                  -------------------------------------------\n                  P(w1) * P(w2) * ... * P(wn)\n</code></pre>\nOf course, I do the log and anti-log dance(if non-log values are required, otherwise leave it at the log probabilities), or else both denominator and numerator tend to 0.<p>I ignore P(spam) because more often than not, I don't have the representative value for P(spam). If I am using a training dataset, P(spam) isn't chance - it is just the training data I used.<p>If I am given a value for it, I don't believe P(spam) is a constant for all sorts of data, and I think using it skews the results. Also, if you assume P(spam) is constant, the scale remains the same if the constant is dropped. That won't give us the actual probability, but this is naive bayes which assumes w1 and w2 are independent, when they are not. I don't think we get the actual probabilities in any case - that isn't an issue as we aren't concerned with actual probabilities but a heuristic which we can use to classify.<p>I tried using extended form of the bayes theorem, but in my sample runs using cross validation, it gave me worse results. Now, as a rule of thumb, I stick to Peter Norwig's advice - ""If your training dataset is relevant, use the simplest algorithm and it will work. If your training data isn't accurate, even the complicated algorithms won't buy you much."" In my experience, I always had better results with short bayes compared to extended bayes.<p>One missing aspect about this naive bayes implementation is it assumes all features are relevant. I have tried logistic regressions with regularization, and they tended to give me same or worse results. So, for most of the classification cases, bayes is my goto algorithm - I don't do any stemming or lemmatization or feature selection. I run it, and if results aren't relevant, then I re-examine the dataset. If they still aren't relevant, I go for feature selection. If they still aren't relevant, well, I mostly give up.",1330343510

You don't need a single server to handle every connection, you can load balance TCP servers just like everything else.</i><p>Skype uses a P2P distributed system, it's a very different system.

I don't have access to Spotify, so I can't comment on it.<p><i>Of course they can, web sockets just provide a client/server tunnel - you can cache on the server like any other RPC service. You can also cache in the browser with javascript vars or localStorage.</i><p>My university uses a proxy that caches TBs to improve performance and reduce outside traffic.

You can still use HTTP/SPDY for asset retrieval and web sockets for data/comms.</i><p>It's less efficient because it can't be cached. It wasn't a new argument, just an explanation of the previous.<p><i>Alright genius and which popular SPA app downloads an entire page with on-demand scripts inside?

Yes, loading a single .js and then calling a <i>REST</i> API (asking for JSON) is a great example of a RESTful website.<p>By the way, ""REST-infected HTML"" makes no sense, unless you mean HTML shouldn't have links, because that's the only thing that can be considered RESTful.<p><i>Gmail.

Example, the regulation for alerting of fire and providing for escape is: ""Means of warning and escape B1. The building shall be designed and constructed so that there are appropriate provisions for the early warning of fire, and appropriate means of escape in case of fire from the building to a place of safety outside the building capable of being safely and effectively used at all material times.\n(a) 1952 C.52; Section 33 was amended by Section 100 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (C.33) and by S.I. 1963/597.""<p>You can do something different from the guidelines as long as you are willing to spend the money to get a fire engineering strategy which proves to the satisfaction of the Building Control department that your design will comply with these regulations.<p>However, in the case of toilets, the layout is much more likely to be constrained by disability access requirements.\nPart M Disabled access\n<a href=""http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_ADM_2004.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/uploads/br/BR_PDF_ADM_2004....</a><p>In the US the regulations vary state by state and are generally more proscriptive.

You can still use HTTP/SPDY for asset retrieval and web sockets for bi-directional data/comms. Trying to force bi-directional comms with HTTP is ladded with in-efficient hacks.<p>>> You're mistaken. Nothing about REST or HATEOAS prevents a web application from serving Javascript that then calls a RESTful API dynamically, using PushState to change the current resource URI locally. \n>> In fact, pushing and running code on the client (code-on-demand) is one of the constraints (albeit optional) of REST, as specified in Fielding's dissertation. Your claim that REST promotes dumb clients is wrong.<p>Alright genius and which popular SPA app downloads an entire page with on-demand scripts inside? \nMost SPAs combine and minify most their scripts upfront and when they are fetching external .js, they're just fetching CDN-cached .js and not a '.js scripts in a REST-infected HTML page with enhanced scripts' that you seem to suggest.<p>>> What Google service uses Websockets, exactly?<p>Gmail. Heard of it?<p>>> And there's nothing unRESTful about SPDY. You don't seem to understand what REST means. REST is not HTTP.<p>The protocol themselves don't, but the infectious sheeps who can't ship XML back without being stuffed in some ATOM-like format or their own custom half-assed re-impl of HTML complete with semantic metadata and urls that they want to call 'Resource States' because they like the sound of their own voice.",1330340494

I think there are <i>some</i> specific cases where you need an A-star list. But more often than not, what you really need is advice for which you don't need to put together an official board until later in the venture.<p>I like the idea of getting help from people. When/if your startup is going somewhere, pay back for their help/advice in form of equity--as opposed to getting an A-star list put together on day 1 which often just ends up looking shiny but rarely useful.",1255363135

876990,comment,876756,876790,0,0,billybob,,,"DustMeSelectors is a nice tool for some applications. Here's how you use it.\nOption 1: Give it a site map. It will scan everything and give you a list of unused selectors.\nOption 2: Load up one of your pages and tell it to scan. It will give you a list of unused selectors on that page. Go to another page and scan. It will narrow down the previously-gathered list (if a selector was unused on the first page but is used on the second page, it is removed from the list). Repeat until you've covered everything you need to.<p>When you're done, you can export the unused selector list to a CSV file. Each column is a style sheet, and each row is a selector.<p>It's a lot faster than doing it by hand, but it does assume that you can see everything that anyone can see. At the very least, you can take that list and search your files for <div class=""crazyselector""> and see if it is truly never used. If it's the only occurance, maybe you can refactor that HTML to use a more common selector.",1255363079

They determine which place is 'buzzing' based on twitter updates, direct buzzes etc for a bar/restaurant.<p>I think the idea has potential - A couple of suggestions that might seem redundant since some have already been suggested above - make it more streamlined (workflow) & integrate fb connect. Twitter integration will also be great to buzz places automatically via Twitter. Any plans for mobiles ? Additionally, check if you use yelp api to populate places - dont know if it will violate their ToS, but no harm in checking.<p>edit: You could also add relative scores - ie, a bar/restaurant that was in the top position has down by x percentage etc.",1255362898

876843,comment,875642,876515,0,0,btilly,,,"With currying, you can easily make functions of n variables out of functions of one variable.  To avoid syntactic confusion, here is a comparison in JavaScript<p><pre><code>  // Call this with foo(x, y)\n  function foo (x, y) {\n      return x*y;\n  }\n\n  // Call this with foo(x)(y)\n  function foo (x) { return function (y) {\n      return x*y;\n  }}\n</code></pre>\nThe key thing to notice is that you can get from one form to the other with a straight text substitution.  So restricting yourself to functions of one variable involves no loss of generality.<p>Going back to the lambda Calculus, you can do Boolean logic there as well.  See <a href=""http://safalra.com/science/lambda-calculus/boolean-logic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://safalra.com/science/lambda-calculus/boolean-logic/</a> for details.  In fact I believe that the if construct in Haskell is just syntactic sugar around that.  So it isn't that there is a decision made within the function, but rather that you call a function which turns out to be one of two different functions.",1255360191

I guess you&#x27;re hoping to outsource the cost of shipping, storage, etc. while still getting some money for finding the deal.<p>But if you don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of buying and selling the book yourself for that amount of profit, what makes you think other people will? Why not just make all these deals yourself and take 100% of the profit?<p>Edit: I guess you answer my question in the FAQ.

7706059,comment,7703188,7703452,4,0,azakai,,,"I don&#x27;t think there is a &quot;victory&quot; here. Just an important milestone for Safari/JavaScriptCore. They have done some amazing engineering here!<p>In the broader context, this shows that the JSC approach of taking LLVM and using it as a JIT - called FTL - can beat Chrome/v8 on large long-running computational code. That means that LLVM is significantly better than v8&#x27;s backend JIT at some things. This is not too surprising since LLVM is much larger and sophisticated - it has a more powerful register allocator, supports things like float32, etc.<p>Those two examples weren&#x27;t random - Firefox has added an LLVM-like register allocator and float32 support (not just for asm.js code, in general). So there are two paths here: Safari takes LLVM, and Firefox implements some bits from LLVM in its own JIT. v8 so far has done neither, but hopefully has plans to do one of the two, or some other cool thing.<p>In addition there is the issue of asm.js. Safari doesn&#x27;t detect it, and beats Chrome but still trails Firefox. But it&#x27;s far from clear that is the last word - Safari&#x27;s new JIT just landed, it can be tuned a lot more, presumably. So it might still end up showing that a general JIT can beat custom asm.js optimizations, time will tell.<p>What is clear though is that the Safari&#x27;s FTL JIT took far more work than Firefox&#x27;s asm.js optimizations. If the LLVM-based JIT mostly helps asm.js code anyhow - it shows little benefits in other benchmarks so far - then that raises interesting questions (if the benefit is mostly for asm.js, why not focus on asm.js specifically, if it&#x27;s simpler and more effective?). But again, FTL just landed, perhaps with more tuning it will show general benefits.<p>Exciting times!",1399399133

7705975,comment,7704800,7704800,86,0,stevenh,,,"A few thoughts as someone who has developed games for iOS, Android, and the web:<p>In today&#x27;s world, if you want to retain implicit ownership of your product&#x27;s name, a simultaneous triple-platform release is not optional, it is required. It must be performed in precisely the following way, or your launch will fail:<p>- Register your game&#x27;s domain before announcing it to the public.<p>- Next, upload your iOS app to iTunes Connect and wait for up to one week for the app to be approved.<p>- Next, upload your Android app to the Google Play store; approval only takes a few hours.<p>- Finally, make the web version public, and announce the game along with links to the mobile versions.<p>If you deviate from this order, then you&#x27;re screwed. One example: I released a game on the web and waited one day to upload the Android version to the Google Play store. I figured that gave me a little extra time to test and check for bugs, and what&#x27;s the rush anyway? Nobody could steal a game in just 24 hours, right? Wrong. My app was rejected because Google insisted my app was attempting to impersonate another developer&#x27;s app. The other developer&#x27;s app was simply my own website, stolen line for line, tossed into Phonegap, and released the same day as my website. I explained this to Google in the appeal form, even including a link proving I owned the site the other developer stole it from, and they rejected my appeal without checking the link - I could clearly see in my server logs that they never clicked on it. Google does not allow you to file a second appeal, so I had to give my app an awful name no one would recognize it by, and the clone received all the downloads and glory thanks to the buzz my website&#x27;s name was generating for it.<p>Another example: I was the first to publish an iOS app with the same name as my website. After the app had been waiting for review for four days, I figured it would be approved any moment now, and that it was safe for me to launch my website. I launched, and it turns out that Apple&#x27;s app review process is not FIFO, because two days later, a clone with the same name and all the code stolen from my site was already approved for iOS, yet my own app was still waiting for review. My app was then rejected a few days later because it had the same name as an app that stole my code... again.<p>Gabriele Cirulli is an extremely unlucky man stuck in an extremely unfair landscape, and I cannot fault him for wallowing in the first of the five stages of grief. If Flappy Bird&#x27;s alleged $50,000/day income can safely be assumed to be the average earned by the ads on any given #1 iTunes free app, then the entity which first claimed the name &quot;2048&quot; in iTunes Connect is currently a millionaire, because 2048 was at the very top of the iTunes free app charts for weeks. Gabriele seems to believe or hope that the masses will see his &quot;repost&quot; of his own app and be stricken by the desire to do the ethically right thing and uninstall all of the rushed clones and install the legitimate version and play it with all the fervor and excitement as if the global 2048 hype still currently existed. Unfortunately this will NEVER happen.<p>On a side note, Phonegap is only getting worse over time. Typical Adobe rot is setting in; the last version had a catastrophic bug causing the xml manifest to simply not be read during the build process, because a critical &quot;for&quot; loop was referencing the child element of a nonexistent variable. They swept this under the rug; countless hapless developers were mindlessly releasing broken apps during this period. Half of Phonegap&#x27;s documentation refers to &quot;Cordova&quot; and executing &quot;cordova&quot; on the command line where it should say &quot;Phonegap&quot;. Commands that have different names between Cordova and Phonegap are still documented as the Cordova equivalent, so one must use Google to find other people who searched for hours until they themselves came across the explanation that the same command in Phonegap requires the use of a completely different word. It is an absolute trainwreck, but aside from that, the primary issue for consumers now is that apps built with Phonegap no longer work correctly on newer versions of Android and haven&#x27;t for months, which is why Gabriele&#x27;s extremely simple and resource-minimal app is currently getting a bunch of 1- and 2-star reviews in the Google Play store with complaints about the speed.",1399398279

There are many aspects to text being readable than having extreme contrast with colors. As you even said, &quot;white or light background.&quot; That already shows malleability. Font style (serif vs sans), line spacing, column width, header:content size ratios, etc matter. You&#x27;re over simplifying the problem. Making the text #000 won&#x27;t solve your problems and generally looks worse. When you buy a professional book they also aren&#x27;t #000 on #fff -- that generally will look bad and amateur.<p>Design is an art and takes a lot of iteration of all those things I mentioned and more to obtain aesthetics and usability. Personally I find the new DDG hard to scan in part because I&#x27;m used to google, but also because there are different elements of the design I think to be poor choices:<p>1. The black text for header and content doesn&#x27;t help anything pop. It needn&#x27;t if everything else is setup correctly, but it isn&#x27;t doing any favors. Instead the only color between listings is the favicon which makes it feel random.<p>2. The weighting of the header isn&#x27;t sufficiently different from the body of the search, giving them less contrast relative to each other, and thus harder for my eyes to scan. If they had put the title in all upper case, chose a bold condense font, bigger font size, etc then there would be more contrast between the two.<p>3. The listings are variable length with not much white space between them, so that contributes to it being harder for my brain to chunk and reliably scan.<p>Those are just a few of the issues as I see it.

You can get a hang of the aforesaid structures by coding  the usual functions - find an element, insert, modify, delete, iterating through all the elements etc...<p>As you are doing it, get a feel of the big-O notation - i.e. understand the various tradeoffs on why you would pick a certain data structure to solve a particular problem<p>2) Get some exposure to search and sorting algorithms and understand the various trade-offs - maybe start with linear and binary search, insertion sort, merge sort and quicksort (for the latter two, you will get an idea of divide-and-conquer strategies, recursions and so forth).<p>Most advanced data-structures/algorithms are built on the aforesaid foundations, so with (1) and (2) alone you have strengthened it, and based on your interest, you can dig down further if needed to related areas - e.g. graphs, linear algebra problems etc...<p>3) Get an exposure to OS/System level programming if possible - e.g. if you choose Linux, you can get some idea of processes vs threads, schedulers, memory mgmt, file and network IO etc.. At the very least, writing some toy code here, say opening files, forking a process, socket IO and so forth will give you some practical exposure.<p>4) HTTP/Web services: You already mentioned meteor.js so it looks like you are already familiar here esp. with tools like Firebug to see raw HTTP payloads and so forth.<p>5) Databases - SQL, and maybe some NoSQL use-cases.<p>6) OOP and Design Patterns<p>As you get a grip on the aforesaid areas, the more code you read, it will add to the practical use-cases.

7705725,comment,7694290,7696760,1,0,gammagoblin,,,">Before European hegemony africa was the slave hunting ground of muslims<p>The fact that Africa has been an absolute shithole for the past thousands of years is no secret, nor is it news.<p>>Then, under European leadership after WWI, you have colonialism in Africa.<p>Yes, I do in fact know about it. What&#x27;s interesting to note is that while the conditions weren&#x27;t good, there was in fact several places where people willingly worked for a decent wagei such as modern-day Ghana (Gold Coast). Slavery had already been abolished by the time the Scramble for Africa began (within the British Empire anyway). Belgium is in much worse light.<p>I know what went wrong too, but the point I&#x27;m making is that the colonisation of Africa wasn&#x27;t all that bad. Lots of the infrastructure that exists there today was originally built during the colonisation of Africa.<p>And no, I am not British.<p>>I assume you know what was wrong with that, defending socialist viewpoints like you do.<p>What views is it I have that are socialist? Anti-interventionism? Because that&#x27;s really all I&#x27;m arguing against.<p>>Now, under American hegemony, and largely thanks to constant American milirary and economic support, and just plain free food,<p>You must be ignorant to not know that all the European countries also contribute with foreign aid and food. This is not unique to the USA. Even bloody Russia does. Please point out where this American &quot;hegemony&quot; in Africa is.<p>Africa is a continent, excluding a few countries in North Africa, South Africa and one on the western coast, divided by religion, social inequality and corruption. It is the only place in the world that petty tribal wars even happen in the modern world. Do you honestly believe that the major population of Africa even knows where USA is on the map? Some of these countries have a literacy rate of just 20%. Sudan, Chad and Niger are all countries completely torn apart by internal conflict, and you call this American &quot;hegemony&quot;? Educate yourself.<p>>there&#x27;s a large number of democracies, an >1000% improvement in money earned for the people living there. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s stable but it&#x27;s definitely an improvement.<p>Yes, Somalia, Eritrea, Congo and Ethiopia are truly great places to live compared to what they were before.<p>How about no? This assistance is not specific to the USA nor is it helping that much when all the money goes to the wrong people, that is, corrupt officials who take it all for themselves. The only African countries that are managing fairly well are places like South Africa who have had vast development spurred form colonial times.<p>I daresay current China is doing a lot more for countries like Angola than western foreign aid money does good. What is needed in Africa is not money which goes into corrupt hands. I think foreign investment is much more urgent, and profitable for both. Currently China and organisations like the Red Cross are the ones doing the dirty work. Not USA, and not Europe.<p>>After WWI, British forces took over and administered India. Whilst I&#x27;m not quite ready to say this was a universal good, it was a definite improvement over the previous situation. This united India like it had never been united since over a millenium and built the state infrastructure that made the current India possible. This changed the life of 10-20% of India from subsistence farming to an actual reasonable existence.<p>Yes, it really was an improvement from the old.<p>>With American (mostly economic) and British (mostly military) support the current India was created : the world&#x27;s largest democracy. It was recently celebrated that 50% of India has been lifted out of destitution.<p>The UK has invested billions of pounds into supporting the current India for decades now. They&#x27;ve not provided military support, because India is VERY capable of doing that themselves. Need I remind you that India&#x27;s strongest allies have been the UK and the Soviet Union (now Russia) for several decades now? Need I remind you that Indian military equipment is either exclusively Russian, or developed by themselves?<p>The USA has done about nothing for India. In fact, during the cold war, the two were enemies.<p>>Do you really believe the idea that liberals espouse, that forward progress happens automatically in all circumstances because the clock is advancing ?<p>I have not made that claim. I have made the claim that particularly after WW2 the world is entering a repeatedly globalised state due to ease of commerce and free trade agreements. This can easily be reversed if something triggers the reverse, but I really doubt it will turn around unless we end up in a new global war.<p>>For the love of God, read some history<p>I have, and I know that German interventionism (that is, Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s &quot;World Politics&quot; idea) was one of the biggest causes of WWI.<p>>what would have happened in Eastern Europe if America didn&#x27;t have nukes aimed at Moskow ? The short story : Germany would have a Russian border right now, which would be armed to the teeth. That would have destroyed the economic progress in Europe of the last 30-40 years at least.<p>NATO != Murrica<p>I am in complete favour of European military alliances. It defends European nations against invasions, and it keeps us together instead of making us fight each other due to split alliances all over the place like WW1 and WW2.<p>>Now imagine not just that one event, but like a reading of 20th century history will tell you, an event like that every 2-3 years. Can you imagine what would happen ? Can you imagine what would happen if Russia, or China, or Japan, or ... had global hegemony ?<p>India and China are both two nations that are more concerned with themselves rather than what some anti-American terrorist group is doing i Iraq.<p>>Do you really believe that ?<p>You do not understand the concept of globalisation. The very fact that right now there&#x27;s dozens of planes flying an Europe-America route is a sign of globalisation. There&#x27;s even more cargo ships sailing the same route, and you deny the increasingly globalised economy? For God&#x27;s sake, more than 20% of American government debt is held across the Pacific Ocean, and this is not globalisation you say?<p>>Answer me this : why isn&#x27;t the Central African Republic exporting loads of fish ? Do you think the problem is isolationism ?<p>No. I think the main reason the Central African Republic isn&#x27;t exporting fish is because it happens to be in the middle of a desert with no access to the coast.<p>Aside from that, the economy in Africa in general is very poor. This is not news, nor is the African economies well-being necessary for increasing globalisation to take place.<p>>To read about a worst case scenario, read about the downfall of the Western Roman Empire, and the rise of islam and piracy and constant genocide in the centuries following that. It will show you what can go wrong with globalization, and it will show you how long such a problem takes to fix.<p>There were LOADS of problems during the existence of the Western Roman Empire. The world was full of conflict at that time too.<p>Even so, the Western Roman Empire was not christian. This religion spread in Europe after the collapse of that empire, mostly because the persecution came to a complete stop. Christianity, as I am sure you know, is in the same religious family as Islam and Judaism. Moreover, after the collapse there were still stable empires in the world, such as the Byzantine Empire that collapsed because of relentless Ottoman assault.<p>You also seem to ignore the Holy Roman Empire, which was established later, but also had many long periods of stability.<p>>But generally look up the situation at the end of the 19th century (that&#x27;s 120 years ago, not exactly an eternity), and ask yourself why globalisation didn&#x27;t happen, despite America, and quite a few other countries, really, really, really trying to make it work.<p>Define globalisation.<p>Regardless, this has gone FAR off the point. I have made the point that military interventionism is something that breeds instability. It did so leading up to WW1, it did so inbetween the two wars, and it did so in the modern Middle East too due to Soviet and American interventionism. Military interventionism to accomplish one nation&#x27;s goals has ALWAYS fucked over everyone else.<p>I do not want globalisation, which seems to be your main problem with what I said. I simply made the point that one nation cannot lead all. Only if there was a global government would the entire world be lead by one entity. Currently, the only government which does intervene to a great extent happens to be the US government. Since the article was about the US and how it&#x27;s &quot;falling from its glory&quot;, I voiced my opinion on that I think it&#x27;d be a good thing if the USA stopped messing with others. It would be a good thing if no nations intervened excessively with others.<p>Interventionism by the USA has had many negative effects, some of which I mentioned in my first post. The USA has many internal problems that needs to be solved rather than having occupation forces in over 1000 US military bases around the world. I have made very specific points, and I don&#x27;t see why I have to argue about the development of African colonies to discuss the points I have made.<p>Also, don&#x27;t call people socialists just because they happen to disagree with you. That is beyond pathetic.",1399396151

Granted, the game is stellar and beautifully crafted, but there was a lot of luck involved in the wave it got to ride, from the timing of release, to the time it was posted to HN, to the people who tweeted about it, and so on.</i><p>Hype (marketing) plays a role, but I think a game&#x27;s popularity is generally a function of its addictiveness multiplied by its quality.  There are exceptions, such as Goat Simulator (which was almost entirely a fad) but it seems like the inherent nature of 2048 would let it succeed in any era.  It&#x27;s viscerally addictive for many people, so as long as you can get some number of people playing it, it&#x27;ll do fine.<p>It seems like another reason 2048 was successful is because it was open source from the start.  There were about a dozen remixed versions of 2048, and few of those would have happened without the source code being available from the beginning.  People would have made their own versions, but it would have taken a lot more time than &quot;let&#x27;s just use this code that already exists.&quot;",1399395766

What I&#x27;ve found works best for me is to learn relatively self-contained things, such as the Scala programming language, on Coursera / edX.  For general CS/math courses, I don&#x27;t find the classes as useful.  There are too many issues with unspoken, inaccurate or unclear prereqs.  Additionally, the courses force you to work at a steady pace, which often slows me down in some stretches and then eventually forces me to drop out if work gets busy.  Additionally, some courses are significantly watered down.<p>Taking classes from MIT (or any school with a good selection) on Open Courseware fixes all of these problems.  You do the exact same work as students did, you can see the same lectures, and you take the same exams.  All of it is at your own pace.  Best of all MIT knows very well which of its own classes are prereqs of its own classes, so the whole headache of jumping into courses you don&#x27;t have the tools to take on is avoided, too.",1399395740

This is a problem for IronPython and Jython, and continues to be a problem for PyPy (though they are making strides to solve it), and it will be a problem for newer projects like Pyston.

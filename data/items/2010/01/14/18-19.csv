Images are inherently messy; after you've changed a running system two or three times, it's even odds whether it will actually be the same as a system started from scratch with ostensibly the same variables and functions, in my experience, and there's no good way to be certain, besides restarting.  Since you're going to have files of source code anyway, using runtime images just creates the opportunity for your two official copies to get out of sync.  This isn't worth the few times you could hotfix something instead of restarting the system.",1263495367

It changes version control from an annoying thing that you have to deal with, to a tool that helps me not worry about various details of version control, but instead deal with the problem at hand - the product. The sheer existence of git-stash sold me, and while I'm handy enough to use ""svn diff > changes.patch"" with ""patch < changes.patch"", git just is generally a better tool for that.<p>The biggest benefit of git, over svn, I'd argue is actually branch merging and merge conflict-resolution capabilities. Subversion 1.6, however, is supposed to take leaps and bounds to catching up to git (vs. the 1.4 server install I currently work with). The version numbers in git are less intuitive than svn, but I feel thats okay, because tagging is useful in git. The real win for git, is that git works with you and your workflow, and doesn't impose as much workflow as subversion does.<p>( git-svn absolutely your friend. )",1263495241

Under that rule, boards have <i>huge</i> latitude to exercise discretion without being at risk of violating fiduciary duties <i>unless</i> they engage in what is called a ""self-interested transaction.""<p>To underscore the difficulty of pursuing a lawsuit claiming breach of fiduciary duty, consider this: I have seen first-hand public companies where a VC-controlled board will use a company's resources to cause the company to acquire bum companies in which the VCs had prior investments (sort of like privately funded bail-outs at company expense); even something so extreme proved to be a very tough case to prosecute given that the VCs who controlled the board had so-called ""independent directors"" bless the deals.<p>Taking a corporate action based on so-called corporate responsibility would very likely fall on the safe side of the line for the voting directors in most cases.  Business judgment is business judgment and it might be argued that it is good for business for a corporation to position itself as being ""green"" or ""fair to dissidents"" or whatever else might be perceived as a good thing to do apart from pure financial motives. If they did so where the economic impact were obvious and highly negative, however, this would certainly subject them to class-action lawsuits and would, in my judgment, be irresponsible conduct by the directors - but this would have to be an extreme case, e.g., (to put it in absurd terms) the Google founders suddenly determining that there are higher purposes in life besides making profits and thereby pulling Google out of its core business because it led to the sin of making profits. This is just another way of saying that, though the business judgment rule gives directors extreme latitude, such latitude is not limitless.<p>I think, on balance, that the social-responsibility stuff falls in a gray (but relatively safe) area under the technical terms of current corporate law. That said, directors do not want to be seen as doing anything contrary to the shareholders' interests in making profits and that is why recent proposals have all focused on giving shareholders the right to impose these sorts of things on the board via extraordinary votes. Such proposals have gone nowhere to date and, where shareholder advisory votes have been taken, the social-responsibility stuff tends to go down in flames. Shareholders do want to make money, after all. The post here, then, is correct that it takes a pretty extraordinary situation, such as a dominant founder or two controlling things, for this to happen.",1263493101

""REST + some other stuff I layer on top"" can, but you have to bring more to the party; for instance, you can decide that everything will be JSON coming back, but you had to decide that, so you had to do the work. On the other hand as is so often the case with this increased responsibility you get more power; XML-RPC has no decent binary capabilities, for instance, which is easy with REST.<p>That doesn't mean the work isn't worthwhile. My personal feeling is that if XML-RPC meets your needs, you should probably use it, but if it doesn't, don't hesitate to move on. RPC is a crazy and cruel world, though; here there be dragons. REST is better than starting from scratch in most ways but you can still end up down the rabbit hole surprisingly quickly. For instance, REST tempts you into considering caching in a layer designed for caching human document accesses; this may or may not actually have the semantics you are interested in and it can get subtle.",1263492863

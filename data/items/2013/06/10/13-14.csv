The environmental movement, for instance, generally did not face levels of institutional rejection and physical violence that labor and civil rights did. Why? Because they had a message that a broad swath of Americans could believe in.

Democracies themselves didn&#x27;t come to be &quot;peacefully&quot;: most European kings had to be forcefully deposed one way or another, after they refused substantial reforms for almost 150 years since the French Revolution (in fact, they spent most of the XIX century actually restricting individual freedoms and ramping up censorship powers). Until WWI, there had been almost no progress in many continental countries on universal suffrage, which of course resulted in no progress on all the other subjects you mention. The period between wars was politically very lively but certainly not peaceful nor &quot;within the democratic process&quot;: every country had its fair share of events where police or army would indiscriminately shoot at protestors, strikes would get violent, and so on. The political frameworks born from WWII were then characterised, in most Western European countries, by schemes that basically reproduced the Cold War disposition, with a varying degree of direct dependence of local leftist parties from Moscow. The presence of a well-equipped &quot;hard left&quot; made it possible for softer alternatives to thrive: the Overton window was anchored by the Soviet State on one side.<p>The only country where you can try and talk of a continuous peaceful development is post-Cromwell Britain, which is why this country is still, in many ways, the less socialist of the lot (and getting less so by the day, I could add). Still, the influence of Soviet ideals was so strong even in this land, that there was stuff like the Cambridge Five, something that today is completely unconceivable.<p>Violent revolutions are not always necessary, but they can (and did) provide inspiration for wider movements.",1370870545

Bush, Dick Cheney and &quot;wiretaps without warrants,&quot;<p>No mention of a promise.  On top of that, warrants were issued.  You can argue the merits of the warrants themselves, but it wasn&#x27;t warrantless.<p>Now, if I missed a quote, please share. =)  But, going by what little research I did, he never used the word promise, and did make sure to have warrants.<p>That what he did and what we wanted him to do diverged is surely an issue.

5854036,comment,5853545,5853955,4,0,einhverfr,,,"Ok, so what the USAPATRIOT Act allegedly does (and I want to expand on this below) is allow up to 7 days of detention without habeas petitions having any effect.  This can then be extended, allegedly to 6 months, and renewed every six months indefinitely.  This is what the statute says.  So that&#x27;s what the statute claims to do.<p>In practice it probably does not do so.  There are two reasons to think this.  First you have the fact that even the Bush Administration refused to rely on this provision during either Padilla case, arguing instead that the AUMF of 2001 was the authority to detain, despite the fact that the Supreme Court had ruled in Hamdi that there was at least some Habeas Corpus protection available to those detained under the AUMF, but the exact amount was unclear.  It&#x27;s further worth noting that the Supreme Court threw out Padilla&#x27;s first habeas petition as improperly filed when Handi was released and in the subsequent petition case (Padilla v. Hanft), the DoJ continued to argue on AUMF grounds, not on suspension clause grounds.  When Padilla lost in the 4th Circuit and appealed to the Supreme Court on the second time, the government abruptly decided to charge him in federal court, and then asked the 4th circuit to vacate their decision, which the 4th circuit declined to do (I think that such an effort on Bush&#x27;s part was meant to slow down the next case).<p>The second problem is Boumediene v. Bush (decided three years after Hamdi and Padilla v. Hanft), which held that the Military Commissions Act <i>was</i> a suspension of habeas, but that judges should hear habeas petitions anyway, arguing that judges had the power to grant habeas petitions <i>even if Congress suspended the writ.</i>  This means that Congress claiming to say habeas doesn&#x27;t apply doesn&#x27;t in fact mean that habeas doesn&#x27;t apply.<p>I read Supreme Court cases for fun.

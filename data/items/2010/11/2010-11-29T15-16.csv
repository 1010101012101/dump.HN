1950660,comment,1949227,1950507,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"Ummm. Perhaps you forgot about the part where you claimed, without citation, that ""nearly two in five deaths in traffic accidents are caused by speeding in Germany"". So it would seem we're both guilty.<p>The difficulty in providing any kind of documentation here is that there are many orthogonal factors at play, making it difficult to say much of anything without very carefully defining terms. For example, (<a href=""http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=5309267"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&sid=5309267</a> )<p><i>The bad news is [between 2000 and 2008, in Utah,] 110 people died because they weren't wearing a seat belt, by far the No. 1 reason, outranking things like speed, fatigue, DUIs or distractions.</i><p>Clearly, not wearing a seat belt is not a cause of an accident. It's an aggravating factor, making the results worse in the event that an accident does occur. I submit that in most cases, speed fills the same role.<p>Consider the wikipedia article at <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Traffic_fatalities#Causes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Traffic_fatal...</a><p><i># That the evidence shows that the risk of having a crash is increased both for vehicles traveling slower than the average speed, and for those traveling above the average speed.<p># That the risk of being injured increases exponentially with speeds much faster than the median speed.<p># That the severity of a crash depends on the vehicle speed change at impact.<p># That there is limited evidence that suggests that lower speed limits result in lower speeds on a system wide basis.<p># That most crashes related to speed involve speed too fast for the conditions.</i><p>A close reading of this reveals that it's not generally one's <i>absolute</i> speed (e.g., the fact that they're going 80MPH), but their speed <i>relative</i> to most other drivers, irrespective of the speed limit. So if the speed limit is 65 and I'm going 75 along with most of the traffic, my risk is minimized; slowing to the posted speed <i>increases</i> risk.<p>The third bullet seems to support my claim. It does not say that crashes are more likely at higher speeds, but that the severity of a crash, when one does occur, will be worse.<p>Finally, the last bullet again references speed <i>relative to conditions</i>. Thus, on a given road in given weather, visibility, traffic, etc., 80MPH may be just as safe as 65 under other conditions; and in winter conditions, even 40MPH might be more dangerous than any of those. It's not the speed as such, particularly with respect to any particular posted one-size-fits-all number, but the speed relative to actual conditions. But the laws regarding speed limits do not recognize this at all.<p>So again, for a meaningful debate, I think we need to separate the discussion into causes of accidents, aggravating factors for accident severity, and the way in which laws address these issues.",1291046221

What he says is, that one could qualify Wikileaks as a terrorist organization, if one were to take the definition of 'terrorist' from the Immigration and Nationality Act. Note that under this act various activities fall under 'terrorism', none of which requires 'causing fear'. For example under this act, if you highjack a plane, be it for money or to get a couple of prisoners released, you're still a terrorist, even if you don't want to instill any fear.<p>So his point is that to put anyone on the terrorist watch list, that person needs to be qualified as a terrorist, obviously. But the term 'terrorist' doesn't have a fixed, unambiguous meaning; it can mean many things to many people in different context (ergo that phrase 'one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter'). So if one were to use the definition from the INA, which he is arguing is just a good a definition as any others, Wikileaks (or its members/representatives) <i>would</i> qualify and as such be put on the watch list, which would then cause a whole bunch of other things.<p>Note also that this definition of terrorism far outdates the post-9/11 terrorism scare, so it can't be blamed out overzealous Homeland Security stuff or anything.<p>So nice try, but no cigar.",1291044156

That exponential economic growth has natural limits, and that if we extrapolate the stock market's 20th century returns to the 21st century, you end up with a mind bogglingly (and unrealistically) large market cap in 2099.<p>I forgot what year he wrote that, but it was sometime between 2006 and now.  I don't have time to dig it up and find it, but here are his letters for anyone interested:<p><a href=""http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html</a><p>Edit:  Got myself curious, had to find it.  Here it is, from the 2007 letter, ps 18-19:<p><i>""Decades of option-accounting nonsense have now been put to rest, but other accounting choices remain – important among these the investment-return assumption a company uses in calculating pension expense. It will come as no surprise that many companies continue to choose an assumption that allows them to report less-than-solid “earnings.” For the 363 companies in the S&P that have pension plans, this
assumption in 2006 averaged 8%. Let’s look at the chances of that being achieved.<p>The average holdings of bonds and cash for all pension funds is about 28%, and on these assets returns can be expected to be no more than 5%. Higher yields, of course, are obtainable but they carry with them a risk of commensurate (or greater) loss.<p>This means that the remaining 72% of assets – which are mostly in equities, either held directly or through vehicles such as hedge funds or private-equity investments – must earn 9.2% in order for the fund overall to achieve the postulated 8%. And that return must be delivered after all fees, which are now far higher than they have ever been.
How realistic is this expectation?<p>Let’s revisit some data I mentioned two years ago: During the 20th Century, the Dow advanced from 66 to 11,497. This gain, though it appears huge, shrinks to 5.3% when compounded annually. An investor who owned the Dow throughout the century would also have
received generous dividends for much of the period, but only about 2% or so in the final years. It was a wonderful century.<p>Think now about this century. For investors to merely match that 5.3% market-value gain, the Dow – recently below 13,000 – would need to close at about 2,000,000 on December 31, 2099. We are now eight years into this century, and we have racked up less than 2,000 of the 1,988,000 Dow points the
market needed to travel in this hundred years to equal the 5.3% of the last.<p>It’s amusing that commentators regularly hyperventilate at the prospect of the Dow crossing an even number of thousands, such as 14,000 or 15,000. If they keep reacting that way, a 5.3% annual gain for the century will mean they experience at least 1,986 seizures during the next 92 years. While anything is possible, does anyone really believe this is the most likely outcome?<p>Dividends continue to run about 2%. Even if stocks were to average the 5.3% annual appreciation of the 1900s, the equity portion of plan assets – allowing for expenses of .5% – would produce no more than 7% or so. And .5% may well understate costs, given the presence of layers of consultants and high-priced managers (“helpers”).<p>Naturally, everyone expects to be above average. And those helpers – bless their hearts – will certainly encourage their clients in this belief. But, as a class, the helper-aided group must be below average. The reason is simple: 1) Investors, overall, will necessarily earn an average return, minus costs they incur; 2) Passive and index investors, through their very inactivity, will earn that average minus costs that are very low; 3) With that group earning average returns, so must the remaining group – the active investors. But this group will incur high transaction, management, and advisory costs. Therefore, the active investors will have their returns diminished by a far greater percentage than will their inactive brethren. That means that the passive group – the “know-nothings” – must win.<p>I should mention that people who expect to earn 10% annually from equities during this century – envisioning that 2% of that will come from dividends and 8% from price appreciation – are implicitly forecasting a level of about 24,000,000 on the Dow by 2100. If your adviser talks to you about double-
digit returns from equities, explain this math to him – not that it will faze him. Many helpers are apparently direct descendants of the queen in Alice in Wonderland, who said: “Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast.” Beware the glib helper who fills your head with fantasies while he fills his pockets with fees.""</i>",1291043733

Seastead platforms would only have value as a floating platform.  It's not as if you could easily fence the thing.<p>The platforms could also be hosting things of value, like a casino.  A casino would probably be able to afford really good security, and its owners might well have enough political pull to get the assistance of land-nation's militaries.

There are angular sensors at the joints of the pendulum, and a position sensor in the wagon at the bottom. The control system also needs the velocities of the parts of the pendulum, which it gets through a state observer (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_observer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_observer</a>).<p>The interesting part for me was how the control system stands the pendulum up: it figures out the potential energy the pendulum will have when upright, then jerks the wagon around to add that amount of energy into the system as kinetic energy, then guides the system around a constant-energy landscape until it's upright.

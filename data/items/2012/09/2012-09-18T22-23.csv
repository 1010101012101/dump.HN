4540989,comment,4540776,4540776,30,0,guelo,,,"The back button in previous Androids was mostly fine with a few overloaded functions that led to some understandable inconsistencies. It might get stuck going backwards in the browser or it might dismiss a dialog or keyboard instead of going to the previous screen, but the annoyances were minor.<p>To fix this they inexplicably added a second iOS-style header back button (which is called Up even though it is normally shown with a left pointer). The combination of two back buttons and the difficulty of understanding it, even for developers who have read the long style guide[1], is an absolutely baffling design decision. There is no way that users can intuitively learn what these buttons do. Add the inconsistent implementations and it's a usability nightmare.<p>[1] <a href=""http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/design/patterns/navigation.html</a>",1348009132

4540977,comment,4539401,4540691,2,0,winter_blue,,,"> Many of them use closed-source or even binary-only libraries that have no freely available replacements.<p>How do they port it to Linux, then? (They have to re-compile it right?)<p>I've developed games before and I can tell you, if you're not using propitiatory platform-dependent libraries, porting your game is a piece of cake. What I've noticed is that most of the games on Humble Bundle use a library known as SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer.) SDL is a library that handles two main things that aren't platform-independent: creating a window and receiving events (keyboard, mouse, e.t.c.) The rest is taken care of by the cross-platform OpenGL, OpenAL, etc. libraries.<p>In addition, there's an even better library than SDL called SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). SFML is much more fully featured than SDL, and is C++-based and OOP. With both SFML and SDL, all you have is _just recompile_. And done!<p>So really, it's not that hard to port a game. ""can't justify sinking man-months of effort into a Linux port"" sounds a bit stretched. There are plenty of free libraries available for game dev (atleast 2D game dev), like Box2D, CEGUI (Crazy Eddie's GUI), etc. so if from the get-go you plan on supporting multiple platforms use some of those libraries, and porting will be a breeze.",1348009011

4540940,comment,4540725,4540725,34,0,robomartin,,,"I've posted this a few times on HN.  The solution to this problem is, in my humble opinion, very simple.  Rather than presenting a divided community to trolls, we have to present a united front.  This would come in the form of a legal support organization that would be 100% dedicated to fighting trolls on behalf of it's members.<p>Call it insurance, if you will.  Member companies would pay a monthly or yearly membership fee.  In exchange for this the organization would evaluate any and all patent lawsuits and consider them for representation.  It's stated mission would be to defend members from trolls.<p>How?<p>Well, for starters, imagine a legal organization with hundreds of 
millions of dollars in the bank.  How many trolls would dare risk going up against them?<p>Second, I am not a lawyer, but I imagine that there would be a way for this organization to also create a cross-licensing ecosystem for member companies.  Maybe this is ridiculous.  I don't know.  Imagine that every patent of every member company becomes an automatic IP license --only for the purpose of patent defense-- for all members.  This means that for my annual fee I could have a virtual shield consisting of tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of patents protecting me.<p>How much is that worth?  Any company doing anything at all that is not trivial should easily be able to afford a $10K per year fee.  larger companies could do a lot more.  Smaller ones less.  It is not hard to imagine raising tens of millions of dollars per year and even reaching a hundred million.  With careful management this organization could easily amass a billion dollars in the bank over a number of years.<p>This would effectively destroy the troll business without legislation and it would probably do wonders towards decimating bullshit software patents (or bullshit patents in general).",1348008533

It might mollify iTunes Connect, but mollifying iTunes Connect is just one facet of shipping an app: the runtime is a completely different animal.<p>This is even a difficult condition to test, as installing an app in the 6.0 simulator without rebuilding it for the 6.0 simulator and thus passing the linked-on-or-after checks (and as such, with Xcode 4.5) is nigh-unto impossible, as the 6.0 simulator does not quite predate Xcode 4.5 as the beta versions could very well fall under the ""or after"" part of the link condition.",1348007302

The opposite approach would be to pick a bunch of languages ( ruby, python, jquery/coffeescript etc. ) and get a smattering of best practices in everything without knowing anything too deeply. Both approaches have their merit. In SF, I recommend the latter approach - you will find jobs almost instantly if you do that.

These are essentially the only numbers that actually matter.<p>At the mean, at concurrency 50, we have things like 37.5ms vs. 12ms.  To a user, that is ""instant"" vs. ""instant"".  Sure, if we stack a bunch up on a page, maybe we'll start to care, but..<p>Much more directly, in real-world scaling scenarios, it matters far more if the 98% number is 2s or 248ms than the mean is 37ms.  A 2s latency means 2 out of every 100 requests (and likely > 2% of page views), the user experience will suck.  And, all it takes is 6 requests to ensure that 25% of users experience this (your homepage alone probably requires 6 requests).<p>I'm not just raising this to be pedantic--I've seen plenty of systems that have been tuned to do very well on things like req/s or even mean latency but do very poorly for 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 (vs. being a very fair scheduler at the cost of overall throughput).

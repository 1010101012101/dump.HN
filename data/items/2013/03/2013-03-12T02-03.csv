I've spent the last 14 hours trying to get my company's app deployed on Elastic Beanstalk, about six of which have been trying to get an Elasticache Cluster configured as part of the environment and connected to the code within it. The documentation shows a few limited pieces of the process but is greatly lacking in essential details, leaving me with an extremely slow trial and error process which involves a 4-5 minute wait each time I deploy a new attempt to get it working.<p>Additionally since it is still new there is very little crowd created documentation out there on StackOverflow, etc to help you out where the official documentation is lacking.<p>My experience with Elastic Beanstalk makes me feel like a pioneer breaking new ground on an very early beta, not the user of a robust, finished system.<p>There are other issues I have with the system besides the documentation, such as logging into an instance that was created by Elastic Beanstalk for my app and seeing that it has 30 security updates that need to be installed. Why Elastic Beanstalk didn't just install these when creating the instance is beyond me. Instead I'm trying to figure out how to modify the configuration to get it to fix these security problems as part of the deployment process, but having no luck.

5359748,comment,5359040,5359040,5,0,bennesvig,,,"As someone who wrote a humor book and am currently working on another, this topic fascinates me. For the last month, I've been analyzing jokes from different comedians, looking for the root of why they're funny.<p>As I see it, humor is something that ventures outside of our own ""world,"" yet relates to it. Someone else's inside joke isn't funny to you because it doesn't relate to the ""world"" you live in. This is also true of referential humor like Family Guy. If you don't know the reference, it's generally not funny.<p>From analyzing about 30 jokes, these are some of the repeating themes I've come across:
- Change the context of something (by far the most common)
- Taking a phrase literally
- Explain something that doesn't need to be explained.
- Under exaggerate.
- Over exaggerate.
- Connect two unrelated things.
- Say something predictable and then take what would have been the cliched ending to an extreme.<p>The core of these elements and many others is that you're taking a shared view of something and manipulating it, whether through changing the context, taking an element to an extreme, or one of the other numerous ways.<p>Everyone knows if something is funny on a subconscious level, but few can explain why they laughed at something. Much like how most people know if they like a movie or not, but can't articulate the exact elements that caused them to enjoy the story (unless they've read several books on screenwriting/story telling). I'd be very interested in seeing the results from this study.",1363056391

5359719,comment,5359406,5359406,78,0,jimrandomh,,,"Ok, here's what happened and what it means. Bitcoin is built on a chain of blocks, each of which contains a set of transactions, the hash of the previous block, and a cryptographic proof-of-work which takes a lot of computing power to construct. Whichever block-chain is highest (that is, has the most total computing power invested in it) is considered valid, and has more blocks added to it by miners. People ""mine"" by taking outstanding transactions, writing them into a block together with the hash of the current highest-numbered block, performing cryptographic proof-of-work and publishing their new block.<p>A block was mined (by the Slush mining pool) which is accepted as valid by 0.8 clients, but rejected by 0.7 clients. More than half of the mining power was on 0.8, so the longest chain includes this block - but the 0.7 clients reject it, and have built a side-chain.  The developers have asked all miners and mining pools to switch from 0.8 to 0.7, so that the 0.7 chain will grow to be longer than the 0.8 chain; once this happens, all Bitcoin clients will agree that it is the real one. In the meantime, however, merchants running Bitcoin 0.8 may be targeted by double-spend attacks: if they receive money in a transaction that exists only in the 0.8 blockchain, the same money is spent in a different way on the 0.7 blockchain so the transaction can't just be copied over, and they act on the receipt of money by sending goods before the situation is resolved, then they could lose money. This is why MtGox has suspended Bitcoin deposits. (This can only happen if the coins were sent by someone who is using malicious, nonstandard software; transactions made by honest users will be copied to the 0.7 fork and mined without any issue.)<p>The height of the two chains can be monitored at <a href=""https://coinbase.com/network/blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coinbase.com/network/blocks</a> . Currently the 0.7 chain is 13 blocks behind, which (since the normal mining rate is 6 blocks per hour) sets a lower bound of about two hours on resolution - assuming everyone switches their mining power immediately - but realistically it will probably be more like 6-12 hours.",1363056011

What happens is that if the chain is forked, and if a client unexpectedly sees that another chain (say chain B) suddenly replaces the chain it was following (say chain A), thereby reverting a bunch of transactions, then the client will automatically retransmits its transactions that it had saved in chain A, to have them saved again in chain B.<p>That is how a non-malicious client operates.<p>Of course, if you are a malicious person, you can actually kill the client and manually wipe out its cache of transactions before it has time to retransmit transactions for chain B (therefore recovering coins that you had spent on chain A).",1363054755

For years I thought it was normal for the browser to slow down and become increasingly unresponsive the more tabs you had open. It was frustrating, but you had to accept it was your ""fault"", you can't possibly have 30 tabs open and expect the browser to be cool with that, I thought. Then Chrome came, and I was SO blown away by being able to have dozens of open tabs without the slightest change in the overall performance of the browser, I didn't even care I couldn't use many of the extensions I had on FF. I couldn't help but recommend everyone I knew to do the switch aswell after realizing I would not be back to FF.",1363053925

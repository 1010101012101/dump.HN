1954474,comment,1954178,1954409,0,0,lwhi,,,"To be fair, design usually does involve making a company a quick buck.<p>On one level, design is applied art -> involving artistic principles to achieve a specific purpose.  Because we live in a highly commercial world, that purpose usually involves making money.<p>What's the difference between art and design? In my opinion; design is prstitution, art is msturbation.  Why bother thinking about definitions?  Because doing so provides a framework for examining related ideas and concepts.<p>EDIT: removed some letters from two (possibly?) inflammatory words, and reposted - as the post was listed as [dead].  Would this have been the reason?<p>EDIT2: Re. my comparison of art and design, I was being flippant - but I was also trying to highlight motivation without putting either on a pedestal.  A designer has to do create work for someone else, for money.  An artist creates work for more selfish reasons - to please themselves.",1291132783

I've been there with the vowing-never-to-ride-again, but with the incidents involving cars, the outrage sometimes helps to motivate returning to the saddle, fueling cyclist-driver antagonism, as in ""cars can't keep me off the road."" It has also helped to remind me to treat every car door as a potential trap, and every car as a pseudo-malicious beast out to get me, and thus ride with more vigilance and care.",1291132701

Some of the best designers I've ever met were absolutely terrible at interpersonal communication and were completely dependent on the project manager to talk to the client and figure out the communication problem.<p>There's a lot of iteration and specialization going on, and a lot of times I did a complete UX overhaul of what the graphic designer made while keeping his visual styling entirely, working almost exclusively with the art director and PM.<p>Slightly off topic; As a designer, I find it fairly interesting to see things from the other point of view on this board. It's this kind of boy/girl mutual insecurity where everybody thinks the other side is completely cool and self-assured, and I'm hiding here thinking ""you guys <i>want us too?</i>"".

1954462,comment,1953540,1953540,0,0,CoffeeDregs,,,"I recently and very reluctantly switched from Ruby+Rails to Python+Django.  I really preferred Ruby's syntax: to me, it's just prettier and cleaner than Python.  I really preferred Rails' organization: less flexible than Django means faster development when my projects fit into Rails' organization...<p>... but YKatz's article gives me comfort that I made the right decision.  While you can accomplish many of the same bits of magic in Python, it's much harder to do so.  Clearly, I'm not a Ruby ninja, but I am someone trying to get stuff done and the pervasiveness of monkey-patching in Rails bit me a number of times (track down some function only to find out that I was looking at the wrong, un-monkey-patched version). I hadn't really realized how much I <i>don't</i> miss Ruby until reading through YKatz's article on how Ruby 2.0 will handle monkey-patching.  How about just making monkey-patching harder?<p>Python has plenty of complexity, but you <i></i>don't need<i></i> to know about it: you can use Django just fine without paying much attention to the richness of Python.

1954460,comment,1954178,1954409,0,0,fredoliveira,,,"Valid points - although I certainly didn't expect my words to be taken at face value and judged by the layout of the site itself, which I decided should be as simple as it could. My work is not this blog, I am not a writer, so when I write, I keep things simple (much like I like them when I read). Also, sometimes I'm just lazy when working for myself :-)<p>I appreciate that you named a few people I'm friends with and whose work I respect. I also know they're not writing pieces like this - which I see as a problem. I do think awareness to the shifting role of the designer is necessary at this point. I've been in this industry for over 10 years now and design and designers are still undefined. Years ago I used to joke that everyone is a designer. Now that I'm taking less of an engineering (and design) role in companies and more into investing/advisory, I feel entrepreneurs and designers SHOULD be aware of what the market needs (and will expect soon)<p>To answer your main point, which is that I didn't say what design should achieve. I didn't indeed - not in this post (check the previous posts for that). I am CERTAINLY (and this is where we'll disagree on the interpretation of my words) not saying design is a way to make companies a quick buck - it <i>is</i> a differentiating factor in the success at startups (and I've seen quite a few in my work, trust me).

1954458,comment,1954271,1954271,0,0,eof,,,"I don't think your definition of 'true rebel' is really that robust.  A rebel is not a someone who refuses to be apart of anything.  A true rebel is someone who acts of their own convictions, and those convictions happen to conflict with the hierarchical structure the person is acting within.<p>I was definitely a rebel for a big part of my life; my convictions haven't changed, but I can barely call myself a rebel now.<p>I was a raging atheist in an east-texas public (read: baptist) high school.  I was a catalyst in the conversion quite a few kids away from their church, and the catalyst for many dozens in getting high their first time.  I didn't do it because I hated the establishment, though I did hate the establishment.  I did it because a) I thought religion was bad, and b) I thought getting high was good.<p>I was a successful rebel in that regard, not only in my endeavors, but I benefited socially from it as well.  I had hot girlfriends and got a superlative at prom, people liked me etc.<p>Now, ten years later, my convictions are largely the same.  But I live in the northeast.  Atheism is boring when everyone around you isn't a raging theist.  Being a pot evangelist doesn't really make sense to me anymore.<p>However, my convictions with regard to politics and science are often severely removed from the general zeitgeist.  In that regard I am still a rebel.  However, since I don't actually function in any visceral way inside a hierarchy that those convictions conflict with day to day; I don't really feel like or consider myself a rebel like I did back in the day.<p>With regard to seeing a lack of rebels here; I am not surprised at all.  Not because I don't expect self-directed people here (as all true rebels are), but because of what is being discussed.  Computer science especially doesn't leave too much room for rebels.  Sure there are design elements that people don't like (I love web2py but pyhtonistas seem to hate it); but that is hardly 'rebellious.'  Computer science is such an objective `thing` that if you disagree with 'everyone' you are probably wrong, rather than a rebel.<p>As far as employment: ???.  There are more people per capita here than nearly anywhere with people taking an alternative approach into making money.  How often to you hear 'degrees are worthless, if you can code you can get paid' on here?<p>Social networking, I have to somewhat agree with you here.  I am somewhat surprised by the lack of foresight people show with their willingness to divulge their lives to facebook.  There are however many of us who opt-out; I'd guess a larger-than-average population here than elsewhere do opt out.<p>But in general, a rebel is not one who is 'not part of a large group.'  That is a loner.  Or a nihilist, or a pariah.  A true rebel is one who exists within a hierarchy and acts in ways that defy the implied or explicit authority of the hierarchy.  Not being part of a majority is only incidental; a true rebel who convinces 51% of people to be on their side no longer has anything to rebel against.<p>tl;dr: I used to be a rebel but not anymore.  People don't come across as 'true rebels' on here as often as they are due to what is being discussed.",1291132568

It is perplexing how it keeps getting a free pass on here.<p>Nonetheless, for the sake of argument let's go with the notion that Android really is the domain of ""(very) low-margin Chinese manufacturers"" (ignore that the top selling devices are high-end devices like the Droid X, Galaxy S, Desire Z, etc), would having their own OS really defend Nokia from competing with them?<p>Of course it wouldn't. Android isn't taking marketshare from Android -- it's taking it from <i>every other maker</i>. You can't stick your head in the sand and pretend that somehow that helps your margins.

It was a <i>disaster</i>. Now they use commodity hardware with a glossy shine, and it has dramatically helped their bottom line: They differentiate on top of the common, and that is their secret to success. This is almost entirely the case with the iPhone as well, where the processor is made by Samsung, the wireless chipset by broadcom, the screen by various manufacturers, etc.<p>The whole ""the iPhone model proves the case"" analysis is a profound example of a confirmation bias.

She loved it and called me back two days later and asked to meet with me for breakfast. When I arrived, she was wearing a transparent shirt and no undergarments, which freaked me out a bit (not relavent to story, but weird nonetheless). Instead of discussing money, she told me, flat out, that unless I hire her to be the president of my company, she will put me out of business. She claimed to have six people from Sun's Java team ready to start copying my software. She said she'd go to the Demo conference that year (where I was going to be presenting on-stage) and would badmouth me to everyone in the audience to insure that no-one would talk to me about financing at the conference. Then she stopped and waited for my answer. I thought about it (<500ms) and told her that I would not be hiring her. She basically told me I should should shut down my company because she was going to make it her job to ruin us starting that afternoon. Well, needless to say, even with complete insight as to what I was doing,  a (supposed) team of engineers on tap, and a plan to ruin me, she never shipped a product. But I wish she had because we ended-up ""pivoting"" a few months later and it was the pivoted product that took us to the finish line.<p>Generally, copying won't happen until something has momentum in the marketplace. If, for example, I heard about Groupon before it launched, I would have reacted by saying ""How are you going to get a lot of local companies to participate? Are you going to hire a team of door-to-door salespeople? It just can't scale."" And I, of course, would have been wrong.<p>As far as bookmarking+todo lists goes, I was prototyping that idea a few years ago, but scrapped it because I didn't see it getting the kind of traction needed to be successful (at that time).

After the initial (very, very difficult) adaptation period, I felt great nearly all of the time.  I would get tired right before a nap, but by the end I didn't need an alarm to wake up after 20 minutes, and naps left me feeling completely refreshed and alert. I was in graduate school at the time, so my schedule was pretty flexible, and I had a mixture of cognitively demanding work (my research: a project in geophysical fluid dynamics) and less mentally demanding work (grading, family and home responsibilities).  Again, after the adaptation period, I wasn't particularly cognitively impaired.<p>There is a lot of misinformation out on the web about polyphasic sleep, both by its proponents as well as its detractors.  Some of the things that have been written (polyphasic sleepers only get REM, for example) are just false.  One problem is that there isn't a very large body of peer reviewed literature on the subject; the canonical reference is a volume of conference proceedings from 1991 which can be hard to lay hands on.  The fact that (a) adaptation takes a long time (on the order of weeks) and (b) the polyphasic schedule is incompatible with the way most people live their lives has made researching it difficult.<p>I'm currently involved in a polyphasic sleep experiment organized by the folks at Zeo. They asked for some volunteers to use their hardware to monitor our sleep as we either adapt to a polyphasic schedule or (for those already adapted) function on one.  We're not following any kind of rigorous experimental protocol, so this isn't going to be publishable research, but it will at least provide us with some measured anecdotes.",1291129875

If history is any measure, most of them won't deserve their own topic, but I figure a collection of the URLs in one place would make perusing the list easier.<p>So... Comment away!",1207051126

(I ask as I'd like to do something similar)<p>Do you run your own DNS or do you update records at your DNS provider ? (If the latter how do you automate that process ?)",1207051027

If this were the case, ""TechCrunch will only cover you if they covered you at launch,"" how would this affect a company releasing very often (with not a lot of features to start)? Would TechCrunch still cover the startup because of potential ""promise"" in the market that the startup is in?",1207051024
151927,story,,,32,10,marrone,"Hacker News Firefox Extension",,"I was finding it a little hard to find when someone replied to a comment I made, or to quickly view if there were any new comments on a post I may have submitted.<p>So I made this little firefox extension to tell me when someone has replied to a comment I made, or posted a comment on a thread I submitted. A little YC icon will appear in your statusbar (ala Firebug) which will highlight whenever you have a new comment. Clicking opens a pane (again, similar to firebug) listing the comments with the ability to click to go straight to the page with the comment (and highlight the new comment if you so desire).<p>It can be grabbed here if anyone is interested:
http://wildstabmedia.com/hackernews<p>If you want the source to modify it to your own needs or add to it or whatever, just save the .xpi to disk and unzip it.<p>It was not meant to steal page views from HN, so it really is very simple, and amounts to pretty much just an rss feed to comments related to you. Some notes:<p>- it does not attempt to display comments in any nested hierarchical way<p>- column header colors are gimped on Windows (if anyone cares Ill try to fix that)<p>- the comment tree is currently a fixed height<p>- without an api, I resorted to a page-scrape of the fetched response, making it brittle (in the event HN changes layout). I made a feature request: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=151926<p>it should work for ff 2 or 3, linux or windows",1207050964

My first programs were on Commodore PETs and C64 and my PCjr. (Although I did later buy a mouse for the PCjr, I think it cost close to $200 at Babbages, had to save money for a while for that one...)<p>My long-winded point being that I ""grew up"" with a CLI.  We edited our text files with edlin (and we liked it, dammit!!).  Maybe the folks who didn't get started viewing the mouse as a primary interaction device feel more comfortable with vi, and never really missed the mouse interface.",1207050566

Roth probably took that for granted. I certainly would. Otherwise I hereby claim P = NP and preemptively accuse anyone not accepting this of deliberate dishonesty and bad spirit and categorise their disagreement as ""formally possibly up to DH5 but effectively DH1 at most"".",1207050347

People sometimes forget stuff, whereas a database doesn't. People are sometimes mislead by experience/spurious correlations, while a properly designed computer system won't be.<p>So I would, in fact, assign important decisions about my medical care to a java program written by a team of doctors, pharmacists and computer geeks.",1207050056

That means that you can find cheap smart labor if you're looking to hire (Carnegie Mellon has lots of coders).  A noteworthy number of startups/startupy ideas came out of CMU students, including buxfer, flexcar, and recaptcha.<p>2) Everything here is really really cheap.  The cost of living is 84% the national average, vs. 182% for Silicon Valley.  A lot easier to bootstrap something.<p>Full disclosure: I'm only in Pittsburgh for school and intend to move to SV ASAP.

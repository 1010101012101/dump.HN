The goal was to put satellites in odd orbits and still be able to return to a fixed airstrip, requiring great lateral transit. There were plenty of smaller lifting bodies that could have done most of the work, but the Shuttle was built to handle pretty exotic polar orbits from a west coast launch facility.. that never happened.",1437098584

On the other hand, since you are glad that you read it, maybe that&#x27;s an argument against deciding whether or not to read based solely on the title.",1437098438

Why can&#x27;t I say &quot;uncomputable function X is the basis for morality&quot;, and simultaneously believe that X satisfies principle Y? There&#x27;s nothing about uncomputable functions that says you can <i>never</i> know a value, and principles are useful even if they aren&#x27;t always correct anyway.<p>>making moral decisions becomes about looking at each _specific_ situation, and applying as much context as possible - instead of trying to say &quot;well in general, X is bad&quot;.<p>Why can&#x27;t an uncomputable function have a rule that X is bad? It might not be computable in all cases, that doesn
&#x27;t mean it can&#x27;t have rules.",1437098430

They would hold on to some object with their arms and not let go.<p>> Some would let themselves be captured, only to use the net as a trampoline. They’d leap off the mesh and onto the floor — and then run for it. Yes, run. “You’d chase them under the tank, back and forth, like you were chasing a cat,” Warburton said. “It’s so weird!”<p>> [..] “Catching her for the maze always took twenty minutes,” Warburton said. “She’d grip onto something and not let go. Once she got stuck in a filter and we couldn’t get her out. It was awful!”<p>What seems far more awful is using these apparently-highly-intelligent animals for laboratory experiments, against their will.<p>This isn&#x27;t the usual argument of animal rights. Here we have a highly intelligent and inventive creature repeatedly trying its best to escape - it&#x27;s hard not to identify with it! - and the scientists just recapture it by force.

People upthread already mentioned using ajax to get the next/previous quotes; why not go a step further and send it all to the user in a straight js file?<p>Think about it: you said you scraped the data, so it's not like it's going to be constantly updated - when it changes, it will all change at once and you can update the versions of your data files. And there's only a fairly small amount of data, especially compared to the size of your css and background images (1000 short quotes with title/author/image/url will be well under 500kB, and the compression ratio will be much better than images).<p>(hmm, 500kB might actually be too big - perhaps have 10 separate .js files with 100 quotes each, and download a new block when needed? If you shuffle the order of the blocks and then within each block, it will appear ""random enough"" to users)<p>So, far less server load, and much faster for the user too. Makes the forward/back problem someone mentioned much easier to solve too - the browser can remember everything itself, and you don't need to track anything server-side.",1350979187

The JVM also tends to be pretty poor at using memory effectively.  All objects need to contain class and lock pointers, for example.  On a 64-bit machine, this generally means that the minimum size of an object is around 16 bytes (may vary by JVM).<p>Will Java still be used decades from now?  Of course.

I often find myself blocked on our product or visual design teams to work out the exact UI/UX of our product. If I attempt to get a head start on my work, I will often end up scrapping my work down the road, because the design team will come up with a new approach to implement. Recently, I've had a hard time motivating myself to build out features that will eventually need to be re-written after design input. I instead want to wait for our product designs to be more fleshed out before spending the engineering effort. This leaves me with free time where I'm essentially blocked on others. I can do code maintenance work and small bug fixes, but building out larger features has these dependencies on others.<p>How does HN deal with these scenarios?",1350978309

It also backs up my point about the dark web. There are huge swathes of professional software engineers who don't participate in blogs and the open source movement. Also lots of old stale information is out there clogging up the web.<p>2. Have you ever had to manipulate a heavily nested apache or nginx configuration file with sed/awk? (even with debian's nice sites-available/sites-enabled structure?). The only hope is to write a script to regenerate the files on demand. Chef/puppet make this easier but it's still a pain in the butt. In fact I'd say compared to appcmd, it's an absolute nightmare. I can think of many examples like this.<p>3. Name 20 companies that are Linux only. I can name 50 in the FTSE100 that are windows only. There is more market value in the companies below the top 100 than there are in the top 100 in most exchanges (do the stats).<p>4. Thanks for the build clarification. We use TeamCity as well and do integration builds from our VCS master but we publish from team city artefact drops, not from our VCS. We don't use NuGet as it only started to support dependency materialization recently.",1350977038

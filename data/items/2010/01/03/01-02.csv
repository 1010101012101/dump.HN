You could come up with some rough numbers for that, but the FDA doesn't post any information on added costs and deaths during trial periods. Obviously the safety trials save some lives, but the efficacy standard the FDA has is extremely high and adds millions and years to costs.<p>> I would be more comfortable with point 4 if we once again banned prescription drug advertisements.<p>The tough question is for drugs that people not be aware there's solutions for - erectile dysfunction, for instance. A lot of men just assumed that was something you had to live with when you got older before Viagra came out. Advertising for Viagra was probably a win for everyone involved - it educated doctors and patients that it's available, and obviously men and their partners were quite happy with its effects.<p>So some advertising definitely has positive benefits, but I see what you're getting at with snake oil claims if the FDA isn't as strict about playing gatekeeper.

Yet Frischling's own attorney advised him that he had no legal basis for hiding his source.<p>I imagine that Arrington's own attorney would advise him essentially the same way. I assume that Arrington and his company would comply with all other types of subpoenas; assuming similar legal advice in a similar situation it's hard to see why he would refuse to comply with this particular type of subpoena.<p>Bloggers may look like journalists to many of us, and many bloggers may feel like journalists, but at least at present, as I understand it, bloggers are not journalists in the eyes of the court. Bloggers are merely average Joes with no special status. That should probably change, but we're far from there yet.<p>Essentially, Arrington is blaming the victim. I suppose Frischling should have worn a more modest constitutional dress if he didn't want to be raped by the TSA. And yes, I consider threatening someone with the loss of their job to be rape-like, and certainly far outside the bounds of professional law enforcement conduct.<p>By the way, Chris Elliot, the other threatened blogger, wrote a very classy thank you to all the people who helped him through the episode. He has nothing but good words for Steven Frischling, and for the professional conduct of the DHS agent who served the subpoena.<p><a href=""http://www.elliott.org/blog/to-the-team-of-friends-allies-and-advisers-who-helped-make-the-subpoena-go-away/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elliott.org/blog/to-the-team-of-friends-allies-an...</a>",1262481027

I actually think something that works <i>like</i> dropbox could achieve this.  Keep a copy locally on my machine, but have it all sync'd and stored online.  There wasn't really a need for this 10 years ago.  We pretty much had one <i>computer</i>.  Now we have many, and the number will only grow larger.  Mobile phone, kindle, tablet, game console, netbook, desktop pc,etc. are all computers.  Someone needs to create something so all of these devices can be in sync/talk to each other.

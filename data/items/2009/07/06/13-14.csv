With large companies there's a track record and probably enough visibility that the investor knows of their existence and could approach the company directly. Look at the way Fred Wilson works. It seems like he often starts by trying out the product before he knows the team(although he may spot them through his own web of connections).<p>With smaller investments, there's so many, it seems clear that there needs to be a filter to what you see. From the outside, it might seem like you need to be on the in-crowd in order to get a referral, but there are actually plenty of ways to work your way up to that referral by impressing people on the periphery.<p>One of my friends just took (or maybe is just about to take) money from Marc and he started out as an unconnected founder. But he worked is way into the meeting by impressing a series of people. The process, though, took two years, went through at least three levels of filters. So start by impressing the people around you. If you really are impressive, they'll introduce you to more people.<p>However, if you have an idea, nobody will vouch for you, and you need money now, then you're probably not going to get money even if you could get a meeting with Marc.",1246888168

It strikes me as being too cute by half and I can think of any number of counterexamples. For example, Norway, Canada and Australia have immense resource wealth per capita and no-one would say they're bad places to live. And Canada has 3x Russia's oil reserves, with 1/5th the population!<p>I think resource wealth is just a multiplier.

Size isn't isn't the only difference between ""a bin in your back-yard"" and ""industrial size anaerobic digesters"".<p>Take a walk in the woods.  You'll see plenty of ""not fresh earth"" that has been dead for more than 3 months.  As I discovered when I used composing to get out of some yard-waste disposal work, composting requires actual work.  (I've actually done this a couple of times, the most recent with worms.)<p>I'm a big fan of ""actually earth friendly"" as opposed to feel-good.  If you cherry-pick the easy stuff (mostly large metal objects), it's actually quite hard to do significantly better than a landfill.  And, in a couple of decades, landfills will be a great place to find resources.  (We're already harvesting methane from them and it's viable to harvest other things now.)<p>The US has a waste disposal ""crisis"" because it created one.

If you sell desktop apps and will sell them on the web, then you too are a ""web startup"" in many minds. Even if you put that aside, I don't get how it matters that you aren't a web startup. I think of HN as more of a tech startup resource rather than a web startup only resource. I posted a question about merchant accounts the other day and got some great answers. There's nothing ""web startup"" about that - if you want to accept CCs, you need a merchant account. I asked also about virtual PBX accounts, project mgmt site recommendations and more. It's a great community to tap into for any tech startup IMO.",1246886728
689597,comment,689423,689423,0,0,gjm11,,,"This is about a (rather bad, I think) paper investigating a <i>really extreme</i> version of the Peter principle: what happens if competence at one level is <i>totally uncorrelated</i> with competence at the level below? In that situation, duh, it turns out that you want to promote the worst-performing people. (Because they'll do just as well after promotion as the best-performing people, by hypothesis, but promoting them out of the lower level makes things better at that level.)<p>The paper takes a purely empirical approach (simulate an organization with given performance characteristics and promotion rules, and see how well it does according to an ad hod measure), and it doesn't even seem that its authors have understood why it's obvious that under what they call the ""Peter hypothesis"" -- which is not in fact quite the hypothesis Laurence Peter made, and neither is their version of the Peter principle correct -- promoting the worst performers is best.<p>The paper also considers a ""Common Sense Hypothesis"", namely that competence at different levels is strongly correlated. Unsurprisingly, the authors find that promoting the best performers works then.<p>Of course, reality probably doesn't quite match either the overoptimistic ""common sense hypothesis"" or the overpessimistic ""Peter hypothesis"". The authors apparently think that a good way to deal with this is to ask what minimizes your worst-case losses if you know that one of those hypotheses holds but don't know which. So they recommend either promoting at random, or alternating between promoting the best performer and promoting the worst performer.<p>It might be interesting to do a study like theirs using more realistic models of employee performance at different levels of the hierarchy, but I don't see much value in what they've done.<p>(Let me speculate mischievously that the authors are probably quite good at what they mostly do for a living; perhaps the apparent lack of correlation between that and their success in investigating the Peter principle is itself evidence for their version of the ""Peter hypothesis""...)",1246886717

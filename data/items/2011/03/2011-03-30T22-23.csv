That being said, did you approach them with an offer to sell them the app?<p>In the Bay Area we have a variety of 'CalTrain' apps which vary in quality and utility, they all rely on the same data. None (in my opinon) capture the elegant simplicity of the original PalmOS application.<p>In terms of infrastructure improvement, a generalized mash-up of all public transit combined with location based sensing and destination intent would seem to be the end goal. Maybe with an overflow timeout that links to Uber :-)",1301525988
2389603,comment,2388839,2389025,1,0,jnankin,,,"I think part of this is the fact that there are a myriad of functions that are just ""baked in"" to the language, making it a little chaotic. Sometimes it seems like some PHP contributer needed some function and just decided to add it to the language.  (Examples: rsort, sort, http_build_query, rawurldecode, urldecode, etc.)<p>There should be Util or Helper libraries that do that, and in a much more organized way. On the flip side, these commonly used functions are written in C, so they're most likely faster than if you were to write your own in php or load a library.<p>Either way, I love PHP and use Symfony for all of my projects.  PHP/Symfony is pretty much like rails but without the cracked out ruby syntax.",1301525962

So if its ok with you, I will try to explain what I would like to do and maybe you can point me in a direction.<p>I would like to create a game that teaches beginner investors how to invest with real money by looking at a company's strategy and basic financial data. To do this, I would like to use the otc market and about 50 companies that I will provide analysis on.  I would like the transaction cost for the trades to be low, as low as possible to reduce barriers to entry in playing the game. So maybe with 5 dollars you could buy stock and start playing. If it would make sense and be more cost effective, I would do non-realtime trades, and maybe just run a batch of orders once per night.<p>Do you think DMA is my best move? Is there another option that might be better? Thank you.",1301525899

2389592,comment,2388432,2388565,3,0,anigbrowl,,,"Likely it will continue to be a trickle of small iterative improvements rather than big launches. Buzz and Wave were both  presented as The Hot New Thing and both got a very cold shoulder from the general consumer market. Modesty and momentum seem to be key elements in Google's brand perception; the fact that you hardly ever see ads for Google on TV or other mass media is part of what differentiated the firm from Microsoft or Yahoo in the past.<p>More importantly, while having frequent minor upgrades on a wide variety of 'beta' software services gives some a feeling that 'nothing is ever finished,' it means that Google is not fighting for brand recognition with its products in most markets. Although there are several products, such as Sketchup, which are offered 'by Google' but have a separate brand, they're generally aimed at a small niche. Orkut is the only product I can think of that has a really large market (in Brazil) but is not obviously Google-branded in the way that Google Earth or Gmail are.<p>'Microsoft search' obviously wasn't working so they needed something different and settled on 'Bing!' - though they missed a trick by not using a variety of happy-sounding audio icons in the TV commercials and (optionally!) on the product itself. Intel's signature 'tune' has been a very successful element of their brand, and Microsoft had an opportunity to positively extend the host brand but instead opted to develop a new one in purely verbal terms. Their marketing team did a fairly good job - it could have become an embarrassing joke if they had not - but this year they're doing the same thing with the new slogan of 'to the cloud!' And of course, every 3-4 years they have to remind the general public that their computers are mostly running Windows.<p>You get the impression that Microsoft is vaguely embarrassed by its own name and its 1980s literalism, and so it hides behind a variety of hipper-sounding product offerings like an awkward parent at a youth club. Google is colorful and seemingly omnipresent, Apple is a healthy fruit with an iBrand, and IBM sounds so important that a quarter of the country probably thinks its part of the government. Yahoo...well, this says everything I feel about Yahoo's brand management: <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/25/yahoos-404-at-giants-stadium/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2008/08/25/yahoos-404-at-giants-stadiu...</a> It's been there for years now, and I still snicker every single time I watch a Giants game. OK, only 1% of the public may be amused by such things, but the other 99% notice the reactions of the people who build/run/fix their computers, much as people listen to auto mechanics more closely than auto salesmen. that company is in dire, dire need of a brand makeover.",1301525672

This has advantages and disadvantages, depending on what you are doing.<p>It is very easy to learn, and therefore there is a large degree of stratification with PHP devs. Professional coders turn their nose up at PHP, because it is kind of like telling Tiger Woods that you play golf. Maybe you do...but you don't play his game of golf. It's more impressive to say you code in a language that is difficult to do well, and that will punish you badly if you don't code in it well. PHP is pretty forgiving, even for pretty crappy code (I've seen some pretty awful stuff).<p>The truth is that PHP is a great web language. Rails and other frameworks provide tighter integration with the db and view layers, but this isn't necessarily a good thing. PHP allows for that level of integration if you want it (as mentioned, there are many PHP based frameworks). It also happens to have a large, open source code base that is reviewed by many, many eyes, so bugs get fixed quickly and the language evolves quickly. The help manual is superb, and it performs well across hardware platforms.<p>You will hear many baseball fans saying the other team's players suck. Most of the time it isn't true.... it's just a pride thing.",1301523311

Whatever that company/team used before they will likely use again.<p>I'll talk about things in the web space since that's what I know best, things will be different in each market.<p>If it's a blue sky exercise or they decided they need something new then it's mostly based on reputation, the less popular the language chosen the more blame taken by the chooser in the case of failure. In other words, no one ever got in trouble for choosing Java, PHP or C#.<p>Trying to define value in a way that covers even only the big players is tough.<p>Java and C# are chosen because they are big (library support, support materials) and have been around for a while. They are considered trustworthy.<p>PHP is chosen because there are tons of cheap semi-competent programmers who know PHP. It was marketed and packaged for beginners at the perfect time and that worked fantastically.<p>Ruby/Rails is chosen because of marketing (the engineers might be fans, but the business guys say OK and the HR people can find programmers because of the marketing). A lot of ex-php-ers who discovered how bad PHP is as a language when they learned Ruby as their second modern language.<p>This is just in a small piece of the language ecosystem that I know about. Other areas of programming (other markets i suppose) are completely different but I suppose that momentum, marketing and trained workforce are factors in all of them.<p>I think this is too messy a problem to ever arrive at a good definition.",1301523271

creating nested code is one of my fondest dreams.<p>That said, I've written my fair share of [spaghetti code](<a href=""https://github.com/chrisdickinson/tempisfugit/blob/master/lib/repository.js#L41"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisdickinson/tempisfugit/blob/master/li...</a>) in Node,
mostly because JavaScript seems to lend itself to slapping together nested callbacks without slapping you on the wrist for writing unreadable code.<p>In my experience, the best way to cut down on spaghetti code is to design your API around the [EventEmitter](<a href=""http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events.EventEmitter</a>)
object. Consider this adaptation of the linked spaghetti code: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/f8533ff57844b1e54558"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/f8533ff57844b1e54558</a><p>Note that in the application code, there are no nested callbacks -- they're merely concerned with validating
the incoming data and passing the baton on to the next responder. Bonus points: the methods are in the order
of their ideal execution. Clients using the code can just do the following:<p><pre><code>    var validator = new RepoPathValidator(path);
    validator.on('data', function(repoData) {
        // do whatever needs to be done with the repo.
    });

    // redirect all errors to console.error
    validator.on('error', console.error.bind(console));
</code></pre>
I'm very fond of using this method to destroy nested code -- I'm not sure how it's thought of in the community
at large, though (part of the reason I'm so eager for the community to put together the aforementioned PEP-8
style ""best practices"" guide!)",1301522866

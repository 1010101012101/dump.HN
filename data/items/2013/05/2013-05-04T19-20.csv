Your objections are not new and have been discussed at length by market anarchists. Whether or not you find the responses satisfactory is up to you.<p>David writes for a mainstream audience which is assumed to have some familiarity with concepts of economics and property, but does not need to already be a libertarian. I feel he is the best representative of market anarchist thought.<p>[1]<a href=""http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://daviddfriedman.com/The_Machinery_of_Freedom_.pdf</a>",1367697570

Sure some get inspired and try, but the real entrepreneurs just get out there and do it.  No one has to tell them to take the leap, he (or she) has to tell others that it's perfectly normal for him to take the leap.  He's convinced himself that taking a leap and doing it himself is the only way that he can be happy and successful.  And that's how I am.  I started working for startups as my first job out of high school, I learned a lot, and kept moving up.  My parents and rest of my family and friends constantly said and even say now 'When are you going to get a real job with benefits and security?' and I politely say, never.<p>It's the resilience that is baked into my personality and how I work that I never give up and I always make things happen.  It's quite a delusion I'm sure because I have this I can always make it work out mentality while everyone else around me says I'm crazy, but in one way or another I always manage to work it out.  I haven't hit a 'home run' yet but I've always worked for myself and always managed to pay the bills.  Just in the two years from being out of high school I've come pretty far by my own standards.  I'm co-founding a startup now and we just launched two weeks ago at a local university, we gained 1,200 users in just under two weeks at this small college.  It's a small victory in a long line of uphill battles along the way to success but it's the only thing I can imagine myself doing.  And I'm going to keep doing it.",1367695987

There are a lot of issues here, and I will try to add the perspective of a mathematics teacher. The reason I can gain paying clients for my mathematics lessons even though I have no degree in mathematics and no degree in teaching is that I can produce results that many elementary school teachers in my market area cannot produce. Mathematician Patricia Kenschaft's article from the Notices of the American Mathematical Society ""Racial Equity Requires Teaching Elementary School Teachers More Mathematics,""<p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/200502/fea-kenschaft.pdf</a><p>reports on her work in teacher training programs for in-service teachers in New Jersey. ""The understanding of the area of a rectangle and its relationship to multiplication underlies an understanding not only of the multiplication algorithm but also of the commutative law of multiplication, the distributive law, and the many more complicated area formulas. Yet in my first visit in 1986 to a K-6 elementary school, I discovered that not a single teacher knew how to find the area of a rectangle.<p>""In those innocent days, I thought that the teachers might be interested in the geometric interpretation of (x + y)^2. I drew a square with (x + y) on a side and showed the squares of size x^2 and y^2. Then I pointed to one of the remaining rectangles. 'What is the area of a rectangle that is x high and y wide?' I asked.<p>. . . .<p>""The teachers were very friendly people, and they know how frustrating it can be when no student answers a question. 'x plus y?' said two in the front simultaneously.<p>""'What?!!!' I said, horrified.""<p>Professor Kenschaft's article includes other examples of the mathematical understanding of elementary schoolteachers in New Jersey. In this regard, New Jersey may actually set a higher standard than most states of the United States, so all over the United States, there is risk of learners being misled into incorrect mathematical conceptions by their schoolteachers.<p>The problem is not ideally written, to be sure. In February 2012, Annie Keeghan wrote a blog post, ""Afraid of Your Child's Math Textbook? You Should Be,""<p><a href=""http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_of_your_childs_math_textbook_you_should_be"" rel=""nofollow"">http://open.salon.com/blog/annie_keeghan/2012/02/17/afraid_o...</a><p>in which she described the current process publishers follow in the United States to produce new mathematics textbook. Low bids for writing, rushed deadlines, and no one with a strong mathematical background reviewing the books results in school textbooks that are not useful for learning mathematics.<p>But if you put a poorly written textbook into the hand of a poorly prepared teacher, you get bad results like that shown in the submission here. Those bad results go on for years. Poor teaching of fraction arithmetic in elementary schools has been a pet issue of mathematics education reformers in the United States for a long time. Professor Hung-hsi Wu of the University of California Berkeley has been writing about this issue for more than a decade.<p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/</a><p>In one of Professor Wu's recent lectures,<p><a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~wu/Lisbon2010_4.pdf</a><p>he points out a problem of fraction addition from the federal National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) survey project. On page 39 of his presentation handout (numbered in the .PDF of his lecture notes as page 38), he shows the fraction addition problem<p>12/13 + 7/8<p>for which eighth grade students were not even required to give a numerically exact answer, but only an estimate of the correct answer to the nearest natural number from five answer choices, which were<p>(a) 1<p>(b) 19<p>(c) 21<p>(d) I don't know<p>(e) 2<p>The statistics from the federal test revealed that for their best estimate of the sum of 12/13 + 7/8,<p>7 percent of eighth-graders chose answer choice a, that is 1;<p>28 percent of eighth-graders chose answer choice b, that is 19;<p>27 percent of eighth-graders chose answer choice c, that is 21;<p>14 percent of eighth-graders chose answer choice d, that is ""I don't know"";<p>while<p>24 percent of eighth-graders chose answer choice e, that is 2 (the best estimate of the sum).<p>I told Richard Rusczyk of the Art of Problem Solving about Professor Wu's document by email, and he later commented to me that Professor Wu ""buried the lead"" (underemphasized the most interesting point) in his lecture by not starting out the lecture with that shocking fact. Rusczyk commented that that basically means roughly three-fourths of American young people have no chance of success in a science or technology career with that weak an understanding of fraction arithmetic.<p>The way this is dealt with in other countries is to have specialist teachers of mathematics in elementary schools. Even with less formal higher education than United States teachers,<p><a href=""http://stuff.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena/course/6/6.969/OldFiles/www/readings/ma-review.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stuff.mit.edu:8001/afs/athena/course/6/6.969/OldFiles...</a><p><a href=""http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/rev-howe.pdf</a><p>teachers in some countries can teach better because they develop ""profound understanding of fundamental mathematics"" and discuss with one another how to aid development of correct student understanding.

However, if after you put in however much work it takes to cut the diamond, people are able to make perfect duplicates at little to no cost, then you need copyright to protect your initial investment.<p>The only reason it is easier to buy works than pirate them is because copyright does exist, so there are additional barriers to getting the work in a way that the author does not want.

4152444,comment,4151167,4152244,1,0,rcthompson,,,"There are lots of ""damage-sensing"" mechanisms at all scales within the body. These are how your skin knows to grow after an injury, how your immune system detects which cells are infected and need to be killed, and how your cells know which parts of themselves to digest via autophagy, among other things. At the single-protein level, there's ubiquination, which marks protein molecules for destruction, either because they are misfolded, damaged, or no longer needed. But this doesn't work when those misfolded proteins clump together into plaques. Then you need something like autophagy. But even that has limits, and a cell that lives for decades tends to reach those limits.<p>As for A possibly being the body's way of flagging problem areas, that seems unlikely, because such a function probably would not involve drastically changing its 3-D structure (i.e. going from ""correctly folded"" state to ""misfolded"" state), and certainly would not involve forming plaques. These and many other observed features are better explained as features of the pathology and not just a kind of damage signal reporting on the existence of a problem.",1340506086

4152439,comment,4150927,4150927,5,0,sudoman,,,"Please, let's remember that the mentally ill aren't 'evil alien[s]', as the author describes her father. People considered mentally ill are those who generally have emotional and/or cognitive irregularities, be they subtle or strong. That still makes them human.<p>I recognize the need to expand involuntary commitment laws to include evidence of recent events beyond the past 15 minutes of an interview. I agree that something does need to be done about dangerous people in general, regardless of whether they are mentally ill or not. This is a problem that needs restrictive and supportive measures on many fronts.<p>However, most mentally ill people are not dangerous. The author's use of circumstantial stories, instead of statistical evidence strongly distorts the reader's understanding of a typically mentally ill person. In her story, almost every mentally ill person she mentions kills someone. But as the author says in the end, the mentally ill are statistically less likely to harm another than to be harmed by someone else.<p>I think that some of what the author hopes for is a good idea, but if people could be forcibly treated for mere delusions or minor symptoms, then that also includes the huge percentage of normal Americans who believe in or claim to have seen ghosts. Do unusual religious beliefs count as insanity? Are your political views ever considered 'irrational' by someone else? What happens to free thought and religion?<p>The problem with creating laws that chip away at civil liberties is that these laws can be abused or stretched to cover people who are in a 'grey area' and aren't a real danger. Those in power can take laws and apply them according to their personal preferences and values, at the expense of those who do little harm.<p>I think it's a good idea to have involuntary commitment laws only for the rare dangerous cases that exist. But in addition to that, human support is needed. Treating people well and showing gentle empathy will help win them over to the side of those who are trying to help. In the end, let's not harm the large majority who are closer to the middle of the grey area, and aren't dangerous.",1340505899

4152436,comment,4151342,4152404,2,0,timr,,,"It has everything to do with them:  there's no such thing as an ""adult"" stem cell.  There are only differentiated and undifferentiated cells, and ""embryonic"" is a useful description only insofar as it describes the source of origin of an established cell line.  The techniques that those quotes were concerning don't destroy embryos -- they turn differentiated cells into undifferentiated cells -- but that's enough to trigger the objections.<p>Said another way, there's <i>no fundamental reason</i> that ""adult"" stem can't be converted to an ""embryonic"" state.  And the quotes above illustrate that once you do that, you run afoul of the opponents.  The religious groups don't want to prohibit ""embryonic"" stem cell research; they want to prevent anyone from doing any sort of science that they perceive to be in violation of their notion of human-being-ness.  Science doesn't support the distinctions that they're making, and therefore, the conflict is unresolvable.",1340505741
4152435,comment,4150927,4150927,4,0,yonran,,,"This story resonates with me. My mother is bipolar. Growing up she would be fine for a year, then gradually become more active and paranoid and spendthrift, then be hospitalized for several months, and then start the cycle over. In 2008, she drained and overdrew the joint checking account that she had helped me open when I turned 18 and flew abroad, costing us much distress and thousands of dollars (she was kicked off one homebound airplane for causing a disturbance). She was finally hospitalized long enough to recover.<p>But in 2011, when she had another bout, the hospitals refused to hold her for more than a week, and she was returned home only to be a nuisance to her landlord and a weirdo on the street. The social worker said to ask the police to take her to CPMC or St Francis (private hospitals) who will be more likely to hold her for long enough to recover instead of SF General, but since then she hasnt been an imminent threat; merely a loud, paranoid insomniac who cant get anything done.<p>Its very difficult to reason with her regarding her illness, which she denies when shes manic. I dont know first-hand the facts of her police mistreatment or landlord interactions or whatever she happens to be angry about, so I cant convince her that shes wrong. Oh, and she refuses to take her medication because shes convinced that they will ruin her liver. I sometimes wonder whether a smarter, more introspective manic person would be able to deduce logically that their paranoias are irrational and rein themselves in. But alas, her poor concentration and temper hare never allowed her this power.",1340505661

In most modern GCs allocation is bump-the-pointer with TLABs, you can get cheaper than that. If the first generation GC is a copying GC you pay absolutely nothing for collecting a dead object. Compare that to explicit allocation/deallocation schemes.<p>The biggest problem with GC however is not the cost of allocation/deallocation but the fact that it's pretty hard to make GCs incremental at a very fine-grain level.<p>Java, btw, at least with Hotspot JVM, does escape analysis, that will allocate non-escaping objects on stack. Heck, these objects may even just end up in a register (with unused data members discarded).",1340503848

4152389,comment,4149905,4150522,1,0,antiterra,,,"Normal copyright gives an author a ""bundle of rights"" that they may license how they want or declare to be in the public domain. Even if you classify the GPL as ""copyleft, not copyright"" or ""legal judo,"" I don't think it works <i>opposite</i> of the way that normal copyright does. In a world where everything was public domain it would still be possible to circumvent GPL's source code distribution provisions.<p>There <i>is</i> one part of copyright that might run counter to the GPL, however, and that is the right of an author to reclaim copyright after 35 years. If the right applies (i.e. not a work legally classed as work for hire) it cannot be revoked, even by the author, until the 35 year term is nearly over. This right is generally a good thing, but might be a bit messy or disruptive if someone who wrote old UNIX IP decides to try to reclaim their work.<p>Unfortunate or not, intellectual property is a term of art at this point.

But I'll humor you and prove the article illogical two different ways.<p>Assume we <i>were</i> on the gold standard.  The amount of gold in the world is limited.  Most importantly, it does not grow exponentially with our economy (which is in fact the product of two exponentials -- population growth and technology growth).  A gold standard is therefore deflationary in nature, meaning that the value of 1 oz of gold grows over time.  This means that on the gold standard, interest rates would be FAR lower (probably even 0%) due to the inherent ""interest"" built into gold.  However the article assumes both a gold standard (in the first paragraph), and moderate interest rates (5%).  Therefore the article is inconsistent and illogical.<p>Let us instead limit our scope to risk-free loans (e.g. T-bonds). Take risk out of the equation and interest rates simply counteract inflation, meaning that the buying power of your loaned money remains constant.  However, the article assumes both risk-free loans (since it does not account for losses due to defaults), and that one can purchase absurd quantities of goods with interest compounded over several years (which is not true if buying power remains constant).    Therefore the article is inconsistent and illogical.<p>Furthermore, you did not state how this relates to the <i>first</i> half of what I quoted -- something about SWAT-team enforced standards.  I am still utterly in the dark about the relevance of this to monetary policy.  (Wouldn't any policy, e.g. gold standard, require some form of law enforcement to <i>keep people from robbing each other</i>?)",1340503383

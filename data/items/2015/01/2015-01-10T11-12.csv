The main chapters alternate with dialogues between imaginary characters, usually Achilles and the tortoise, first used by Zeno of Elea and later by Lewis Carroll in &quot;What the Tortoise Said to Achilles&quot;. These origins are related in the first two dialogues, and later ones introduce new characters such as the Crab. These narratives frequently dip into self-reference and metafiction.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach</a>",1420891139

After all, if they were able to effect arbitrary changes, they could simply force the government to give them another $100 trillion dollars.<p>The reason countries resist a carbon tax is not the value of oil per se, but the total economic impact, which is primarily from the reduced consumption of fossil fuels etc. (note all existing carbon taxes are on the burning of fossil fuels, not their extraction).  The economic impact comes from people being forced to pay for more expensive alternatives.  High oil prices don&#x27;t actually benefit a nation, unless that oil is exported, in which case a national carbon tax won&#x27;t effect it.<p>So the real barrier to carbon taxes is international cooperation.  But the book argues that the easiest way to create international cooperation is with a global carbon tax (rather than global cap and trade).",1420889457

The latter actually gives you an up-front warning, the former is just &quot;bang&quot;. So any well designed system independent of running on a cloud or on your own hardware should be able to deal with this, since it&#x27;s the reality of servers: sometimes one breaks.<p>All of the bigger Clouds (Amazon, Rackspace, SoftLayer) handle their security related restarts this way, one area/region/DC at a time carefully making sure that well designed systems don&#x27;t notice downtime.<p>What Verizon does is a totally different thing and something most &quot;important but not life threatening&quot; systems do not design for: Taking down the whole cloud with all servers at the same time.",1420888651

Not everybody wants to just genuflect in front of the ultra-corporate ruler(s).

I know android has problems but still its far better OS then IOS because

Just considering oil there is around $100 trillion worth still to be pumped out of the ground in the next 30 years. All of this oil is owned by someone and all these someone&#x27;s are not going to sit back and let their oil be made worthless (this is what would happen if we were to actually do something serious about climate change). Unless we pay off the fossil fuel owners they will continue to block any effective progress.",1420888104

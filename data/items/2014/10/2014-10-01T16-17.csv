Before Bush Jr. my nomination for best president of the last hundred years would have been Dwight Eisenhower (R) and my worst would have been Lyndon Johnson (D). Bush has likely edged out Johnson for worst.<p>Interestingly both Lyndon Johnson and Bush Jr. were Southern Democrats. Most of the craziness about today&#x27;s GOP can be traced to the fact that they were overrun with former Dixiecrats. Bush was basically a Dixiecrat who ran as a Republican.<p>The Southern Democrat position combines everything bad about the Democrats (big government, high taxes, etc.) with everything bad about the Republicans (fundamentalism, warmongering). (Bush did raise taxes, just indirectly. Taxation equals spending as per simple double-entry accounting, and Bush raised spending and increased the size of government considerably.)",1412182629

I&#x27;m open to suggestions!<p>We&#x27;re using Google Drive now for a bit, but it&#x27;s soon going to be replaced. It&#x27;s got sufficient space, but it&#x27;s got some weird problems with making duplicates, duplicates(1) duplicates(2), and it seems it doesn&#x27;t always sync up the latest version either, and you still have to try and remember which was the PC you worked on to get the file. This again causes chaos and mess, if you have many different children all working in their own little folder on 7 different computers. Additionally, Google Drive seems noticeably a lot heavier load on the computers than the Dropbox client. And this is a big deal, because these are donated PCs, so they&#x27;re not the fastest to start with.<p>Currently I&#x27;m looking into SyncThing, see how that performs. But I&#x27;ve only set it up on two computers yet (sharing the computer IDs for initial sync is quite cumbersome, they should add some simple feature to help with that or something). We wanted to try BitTorrent Sync, but it&#x27;s not open source, and I figure as long as I&#x27;m trying to do the right thing, I might as well to it right and open source.<p>SyncThing doesn&#x27;t upload to a &quot;cloud&quot; storage, but we don&#x27;t really need that. We just need something that syncs up all the little folders and tidbits between all seven computers, so everything is available everywhere. Maybe we should instead just set up a shared network folder thing? (this is not <i>at all</i> my line of expertise, I&#x27;m a comp.sci/math/code guy that likes working with kids, if any of the people here have some solid advice to go with one solution or the other, greatly appreciated) (the computers are partly Win7 partly Linux Mint).<p>Finally, while finding alternatives for the above has my priority, if I happen to stumble upon something that&#x27;ll allow me to easily drop my personal Dropbox account, I&#x27;ll do it in a heartbleed. I&#x27;ll probably have to, at some point or other, since the 50GB bonus only lasts a year or so.",1412182267

I&#x27;m not knocking your decision, in fact I&#x27;ve considered it myself. I have a small reseller hosting side business and it would be super easy for me to spin up a host for myself and do the same. But in the end, your files are still being stored by a third party which you have no control over, and they might just have even worse data security policies than Dropbox. Especially when you consider that most shared hosting plans discourage use as a file server, you may even be violating the AUP of your provider.<p>I&#x27;d say the safest bet is a CoLo with an encrypted drive that only you have the keys to, or else a home server and VPN.",1412181866

But I won&#x27;t be giving them any money, and I don&#x27;t recommend it to new users. Instead if anyone ever asks I steer them toward other solutions like Google Docs, Box, Expandrive, etc.<p>So basically Dropbox lost me as a loyal or committed user.<p>The Dropbox thing really peeved me because I really liked that company. I liked what they did. I studied it. It was a great example of solving an old problem in a new way and unlocking a &quot;sleeper market,&quot; something lots of MBA types don&#x27;t get and dismiss from possibility. When someone you look up to appoints someone like Rice to their board, it&#x27;s really kind of painful.<p>--<p>So why do I dislike Rice so much?<p>To me the Bush administration is in a category by itself -- a category that transcends any ordinary political loyalty or bias. I&#x27;m not a fan of Reagan&#x27;s ideology or Bush Sr., but neither of them or their presidencies comes close. I&#x27;m not a fan of Clinton either, but again nothing he did comes close. There is no other presidential administration since maybe Nixon or Johnson that compares in terms of criminality or contempt for American democracy. There&#x27;s also no administration in recent memory that has done more harm to America&#x27;s standing in the world (or its economy).<p>What did they do? In short: they took shameless advantage of 9/11 to sell a whole host of other expensive, destructive, and deceptive policies, chief among these being the invasion of Iraq. They exploited an attack against America that resulted in the deaths of thousands of people to sell things that <i>could not have been sold on their own merits</i> because they were not in the best interests of the American people.<p>I consider that criminal, and treasonous. At least some subset of the Bush administration belongs in jail, including George Bush himself. To the extent that Rice was involved and put her professional imprimatur behind these things, she deserve at least some of the blame. Whether she belongs in prison or not, she at the very least should pay a professional penalty for willfully assisting in officially sanctioned con artistry against the American people.<p>The most insulting thing about Iraq is that I still don&#x27;t understand why we did it. Apparently not only did they abuse 9/11 as a front to sell it, but they don&#x27;t consider the American people -- who paid for Iraq and who pay their salaries -- worthy of knowing <i>why</i> it was done in the first place.<p>The only explanation we received was clear and transparent nonsense about Iraq being related to 9/11 (it wasn&#x27;t) and Iraq having WMDs (they had little if anything and nothing operational). They were effectively contained, and events since then such as the rise if ISIS have shown that removing Saddam did nothing to improve the political reality of the region. In short everything the anti-Iraq war skeptics said about the Iraq war has been true, and everything the Bush administration claimed has been shown to be false.<p>We -- meaning the technology industry -- can do better than this. We do not need to kowtow or pay homage to scumbags from the worst presidential administration of the past 35 years. If Dropbox wanted someone to add super-high-level social proof and political connections to their board, they could have chosen among a wide array of accomplished executives and former political operatives who do not have blood and treason all over their hands.",1412181059

8395640,comment,8394381,8394381,40,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Imagine a world where everyone has access to computation without having to become a professional programmer - where a scientist doesn’t have to rely on the one person in the lab who knows python, where a child could come up with an idea for a game and build it in a couple of weekends, where your computer can help you organize and plan your wedding/vacation/business.<p>This seems to misunderstand fundamentally what it means to be a professional programmer. Knowing some programming language isn&#x27;t it, its a mode of thinking and analysis. I think that with programming things get confused in people&#x27;s minds because there is less of a clear <i>professional</i> distinction between construction and design than in physical engineering, but learning languages and syntax is the <i>trivial</i> part of programming already. Eliminating the <i>hard</i> part of the requirement to become a professional programmer is an AI complete problem, because it means you are getting the computer to do your thinking for you.<p>Many people who try to make programming better starts out with tools like IDEs or analysis tools, maybe proceeds to actual new languages, and ends up tilting at the windmill of transforming programming by replacing it with something that eliminates the need for professional programmers entirely -- and while we tend to get useful tools out of the other step, that last one is pretty consistently a place where we get vague hopes and pretty demos and, if anything of lasting use, salvaged pieces that end up as analysis, etc., tools for professional programmers.<p>I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t interesting or that I don&#x27;t want to see where it goes, but the description provided of both the goal and how the people promising they can deliver it have &quot;found the way&quot; by &quot;studying the past and revisiting some of the foundational ideas in computing&quot; is something I&#x27;ve heard from some group or another every few years for the last several decades.

It encourages the designer to think that what you see is all there is. What about the things that aren&#x27;t immediately evident in a WYSIWYG environment, like accessibility for users with disabilities (I&#x27;m thinking especially of blind users)? And if the WYSIWYG environment uses absolute positioning, as Photoshop does, then how will the UI adjust itself to different screen sizes? An advantage of representing a UI in a human-editable format like HTML, XAML, or Android&#x27;s XML layout system is that <i>all</i> the properties of the UI elements are equally visible and editable, not just the things that are visible in the on-screen rendering. Also, I think that reading and editing the UI definition in a textual format forces the designer to think of the UI at a more abstract level than just dragging and dropping elements onto the screen and tweaking the things that are visible in that environment. And for the UI definition to actually be human editable, one is forced to leave absolute layout to the computer, making it more flexible.",1412179978

If they want him punished, they can do that in a number of ways including firing him.  If they don't care, thats their prerogative as well.  They are, after all, the ""victim"" if there is one.  I think any deception of this kind is a bad thing, and that the shareholders should demand transparency in the management of the company.  Maybe the solution would be for Jobs to give back double the amount of stock value for the gain he would have received in the deception as a clear reminder to him and the management in general not to behave in this foolish manner ever again.",1177627999

17218,comment,16895,17109,0,0,felipe,,,"The problem with OpenLaszlo is exactly the fact that it supports both flash and ajax, and therefore it settles to the lowest common denominator of both platforms. Flex has richer components because it settles on only one technology (Flash) and therefore it leverages Flash to its full capabilities.<p>Another advantage of Flex over OpenLaszlo is the Flex IDE (aka Flex Builder). It's a great product! (Note: Flex Builder is closed-source, and a bit expensive -- $500 I believe)<p>Despite the fact that Flex is Flash-only, I think they did a great job integrating it to the web stack. For example, Flex uses CSS to define the component styles. ActionScript also feels pretty much like Javascript. As a matter of fact, when I started using Flex I had no Flash experience whatsoever and was up-and-running very quickly.<p>",1177626416

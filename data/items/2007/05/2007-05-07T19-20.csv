Democratic practices are completely unrelated to a work environment. No one is ruling over you. You're free to go.<p>Granted, switching jobs isn't a simple thing to do, mainly because our labor market is so inefficient. There are other things attached to having a job, like healthcare, that complicate things. If only we separated healthcare from employment somehow...<p>Out of curiosity, what gains did you get from forming a union?",1178567881
20280,comment,20249,20277,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Democracy is probably useful for any institution with absolute power -- if there's a group that has the right to imprison or kill me, I'd rather they derive that right from the will of the people. But if all an institution can do is give me money in exchange for work, or give me stuff I want in exchange for money, democracy is an imposition that makes them less free. If a transaction can only happen with the consent of person A and person B, why on earth would you want Mob C to interpolate itself between them? The only positive results from that would flow to members of C or to parties that have coopted it.",1178567861

Pricing is in the $500-$1000/person/mo range if spaces are used efficiently (we have 250 different spaces, so these are just guidelines).  Availability is the main reason we want you to call in: availability changes hour to hour.  One day we will come up with a cool web app to let you take a virtual tour of available spaces.

In fact during the Bubble Rupert Murdoch used the history of the car business as an example to explain why he wasn't in a rush to invest in Internet companies.",1178566892

20272,comment,20249,20267,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Ventures have changed. During the Industrial Revolution, startups were started within a company -- Andrew Carnegie was a bond broker and speculator who got into a (very risky) sideline in steel; Du Pont was a gunpowder company before they started messing around with chemistry[1].<p>The auto business was enormously profitable for GM and Ford, but there were thousands of equally promising auto startups at the same time. Most of them built prototypes bespoke for rich people; none of them are still around.<p>[1] And cars. They used to own about a fourth of GM, until they were forced to divest.",1178566668

20268,comment,20249,20263,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""A union brings democratic practices to the work environment.""<p>Do workplaces need democratic practices? I've never worked for a company that threatened my life, liberty, or pursuit of happiness -- mostly, they tend to secure the blessings of (financial) liberty to myself and my posterity by paying me an amount that I find satisfactory. If they didn't, I could always cry oppression, but it would be more mature for me to just find a better job. And if I had a higher estimation of my worth as an employee than any employer, I might consider my own estimate incorrect.<p>It's a fallacy to apply your political principles to anything outside of politics. If you want to work for a business that runs itself like a country, work for GM (and pray for your pension).",1178566305

Since in practice impressing people (including oneself) is the main reason people do hard things that don't benefit users, these two principles yield the same advice.",1178564599

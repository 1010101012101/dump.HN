In fact, one might even suggest that you may need a very large number of attempts at articles until you find one that meets your exacting needs.<p>On the plus side, however, I'm sure when you see such an article you'll know straight away that it's the article for you being neither hot nor cold, as it were.<p>Interestingly, your apparent frustration at not seeing such an article in the (relatively) few that you have read would lead me to suspect that you think that it is quite easy to write such an article. Maybe even as easy as it would be for you to be sure you have found it?<p>Who knows? Maybe that assertion is correct. Fortunately, it has been noticed that there are a number of similar types of problems i.e. that appear hard to perform but easy to verify. There is also a great deal of interest in the mathematical and computing communities in knowing whether, what many of us consider are hard, are in fact, easy. I would attach a link but I have a feeling you've already seen it.<p>BTW on the subject of logical fallacies, may I suggest that dismissing all the articles on Wikipedia because of one article in an English daily newspaper, even though it may well have been correct, is a tad rash?

We expect to detect some certain number of exo-planets with a certain range of characteristics with our current technology.  We don't think this set of exo-planets is necessarily representative of the average exo-planet in the galaxy, because of the limits of our technology, but we expect to look at X stars, and see Y planets, which look about like Z (where Z is probably Jupiter-sized planets orbiting at Jupiter-like distances).  We might also expect to see a few weird planets, where the solar systems are aberrations or we just got lucky and detected something better than we'd expect with our technology.<p>But what this article seems to be saying (maybe a little poorly) is that the set of planets observed is not the subset of planets we expected to observe.  We expected (say) to look at 100,000 stars, see 100 normal Jupiters, fail to see 9,900 other normal Jupiters that were there but we didn't detect, and see 1 aberration, like an Earth-like planet we accidentally detected or a hot Jupiter representing a weirdly captured wandering planet.  Instead, we saw 1000 aberrations, hot Jupiters.  More than we expected to see based on how we thought solar systems formed.<p>Just because the unexpected thing is actually extremely easy to detect once you're looking at the universe in the right way doesn't make it any less unexpected.  Even if we eventually find millions more solar systems that look like ours than ones with hot Jupiters, we might still have to figure out why there are so many more hot Jupiters than we expected.",1367941789

Or maybe their use of multiple techniques allows them to characterize the bias.<p>This excerpt from their recent paper on an Earth-like planet in the habitable zone of a nearby M-class star gives an indication of where they're going with this work:<p>""Using the relations given by Charbonneau et al. (2007), the reported candidates have non-negligible probabilities of transiting in front of the star (2.7%, 1.1%, and 0.6% for planets b, c, and d, respectively).

Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at mine, receives light without darkening me.

5668659,comment,5666587,5666587,2,0,bokglobule,,,"From reading the post, my takeaway is a guy who's probably going to struggle for awhile to find a position. When an engineer says that they only care about the technology and not the product, that would set off my red flags immediately. Frankly, in 99% of the cases, it's the product that pays the bills including the salaries of the team. If I had interviewed him, I probably would have suggested he look for a position in a R&D group in a large company with the funds to do that sort of software engineering.<p>I find many of the interview puzzles that people have posted on the Web that they've encountered at the Big Name companies as often a bit silly. Having said that, asking software developers to implement a solution to a common programming problem - ""navigating a tree using recursion"", etc. is perfectly reasonable.  I've found more than a few software devs who have great looking resumes but who have no idea what recursion is, what a tree is used for as a data structure, etc.  And I consider this the basic, easy, 1st year undergrad type stuff.<p>If there's an undercurrent to all of the comments here, it's that we still don't really have a good way to sift through the good from the really-not-so-good developers <i>quickly</i>.  The programming tests and puzzles are a proxy for this and they only work so far - some people like to think through issues more before coding, or tend to freeze under this on-the-spot pressure.  Doesn't mean that they aren't a good, competent developer you'd want on your team; my experience is that the guys who blurt out very quick answers can sometimes write the worst code.",1367941212

I couldn't believe the number of candidates that have trouble with things like manipulating two arrays, which I feel is a basic level of expectation for a programmer.  If I spend all hour on this relatively simple question, they are a ""no"" from me.  About 10% of the interviewers pass this problem quickly enough to warrant the second question I ask.  Frankly, I'm shocked at how under-prepared people are for whiteboard questions, regardless of how stupid it is.

Sample bias all the way.<p>1) Things which orbit rapidly are easy to spot as we get lots of observations from occlusion and wobble. You can identify a planet over the course of a few weeks if it has a period measured in days.<p>2) Things which are massive are easy to detect using wobble methods. The closer in they are, the more wobble there is. GMm/r^2 and all that.<p>3) Massive close-in things with short periods are the easiest planets to detect by a country mile, as you get a nice big occlusion along with a nice big wobble, all happening on nice short timescales.<p>This entire article is oriented around sample bias due to current instrumentation and techniques. We have little hope of spotting the equivalent of, say, Uranus, with the same orbital period and distance, as we'd need, um, a good few centuries of observations using wobble and occlusion to be certain - and the net effects measured would be tiny, so you'd need a huge pile of data to get a statistically significant measure.<p>Finally, earth-mass planets at an earth-like distance - again, tricky. Less tricky than the above, arguably, particularly if they have atmospheres (spectral changes are a dead giveaway), but still tricky.<p>JWST could serve up the goods.",1367940576

This is signaling that you're more serious than someone who's just following up with an email (think of the volume of the candidate pool you're in) and distinguishes yourself.  Even better, at the end of the interview you could plant the seed for a follow up, like ""It's been great meeting you, blah, blah, blahI'd like to check in with with you next Tuesday (or whatever) at 10am with a brief phone call, as I've got other positions to consider and I know you've got other candidates""<p>>>They then emailed me asking if Id like to stop by their office for a few hours for an on-site interview.

The only policy response even mentioned - and it's not even explicitly called for - is for the legislature to set retention limits. Both of those strike me as eminently reasonable requests, and neither of which claims a general ""freedom not to have your license plate OCR'd.""",1367939043

It's a simple fact of the modern web now and I despise it. But when those emails look like this one, I hate them even more. Why? Because a normal form spam mail is easy to recognize. I can hit the spam button in under a second. But when they use my first name, sound all happy and cheery, and talk like they're my best friend, I have to actually read the first sentence to see that it's spam. It not only takes me longer, but it makes them seem even worse. To me an email like that doesn't tell me they are more interested to 'engage', but instead that they want to trick people to read them. You know what I want? For them to never send me any email unless I specifically request it.",1367938952

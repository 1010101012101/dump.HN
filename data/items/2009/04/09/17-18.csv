554805,comment,554669,554770,0,0,jrockway,,,"Haskell doesn't act differently.  If you translate the Haskell to Lisp:<p><pre><code>    (funcall (elt (mapcar (lambda (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y))) '(1 2 3)) 0) 2)\n     ==> 3\n</code></pre>\nThen the Lisp works the same as the Haskell.<p>The difference is that ""loop"" mutates the loop variable, whereas mapping makes a copy.  In Haskell, there is no way to mutate a variable (that's not even what variables <i>are</i>), so that's the only way you can express the concept.  In Lisp, you can either copy or mutate, and you get a different result depending on which you choose.<p>Closures always work this way.  Otherwise, you couldn't write things like:<p><pre><code>    (defun make-incrementers ()\n        (let ((i 0))\n            (cons (lambda () (+ i 1))\n                  (lambda () (- i 1)))))</code></pre>",1239299924

I meant ""on the <i>member</i> artists'"" behalf; should have been clearer. But my point, that Waterman has ceded the ability to negotiate with YouTube, still stands.<p>> nor is the PRS required to license its music to Google. If the PRS is not satisfied with the deal Google is offering, then they have the option to walk away.<p>Look, I think you do have a point here, but you are oversimplifying somewhat. What you're not taking into account is that if the PRS orders YouTube to take down the videos, the content will appear anyways as so-called ""user-generated content"" (although it quite obviously doesn't merit that title) -- the onus is then on content creators to enforce it's IP rights. Should the PRS then push for all of YouTube to shut down and risk massive PR damage, not to mention hurting all the innocent bona fide UGC creators? Should it be forced to incur the costs of policing the content on YouTube, when YouTube itself reaps all the rewards in terms of advertisements? Or should the onus on policing go to the government, or YouTube itself? All of these issues would need to be addressed were the PRS to simply walk away from a deal. Needless to say, each and every one opens up a horrendous can of worms. So while it's true that the PRS has ""the option to walk away"", it amounts to the option of getting murdered through a bullet to the head or a slit to the throat ;)",1239299901

A nested hash referencing arrays is a good data structure for this.  In PHP this is trivial (though not terribly efficient).  In Ruby you have to deal with maintaining the hash.  There are <i>many</i> ways to do it, but my SafeNestedHash class lets you do it with a concise, natural syntax.  Perhaps if you have an aversion to using a library for this then you would define a pair of methods like key_exists?(hash, key_chain) and set_key(hash, key_chain).  You could also monkey-patch hash to have those methods.  You could also encapsulate the logic into an object that handles all the logic.  Or (as you seem to suggest) you could let the interpreter throw an exception and then handle it with rescue, which IMO would be just a notch behind monkey-patching in terms of bad practice since exceptions should be for unexpected circumstances.  I just happened to go with creating a class that abstracts this all away.  Yes there is a bit of leakiness, but there is no monkey patching, and any other solution would require either ballooning the actual function with incidental accounting details, or else utilizing some other abstraction which would need to be used with the same understanding of its purpose, at which point it's just a matter of taste.",1239299387
554782,comment,554543,554615,0,0,j2d2,,,"The nature of VC is quite different from the nature of the forms of investing that caused the crisis. One of the culprits behind getting the crisis to such a massive scale is leverage. VC firms rarely leverage their funds due to the highly risky nature. Perhaps PG or someone else could elaborate on the behavior of VC or Angel investors because it's crucial to understanding this distinction.<p>Now contrast the nature of VC vs. what people are thinking about when they put money away for retirement. They're not trying to help get a company off the ground. They're usually just trying to beat inflation and, if possible, get a little more. These people lost money in a huge way. The people responsible lost money in such a huge way that the world is now struggling. The whole world. It is highly unlikely a VC could pull something like this off via their investments. Even the dotcom boom demonstrated how investing ones own money and taking on the risks involved will keep a crisis contained primarily (not exclusively) to those involved.<p>Let's also not forget the SEC has not proven it's abilities to catch bad behavior...<p><i>Edit: And, simply on principle, I back the notion that the Gov should generally stay out of my business.</i>",1239299368

With that as the basis, I'm not sure if this is fair to the sperm bank.<p>First, if she's a 13 year old girl with learning disabilities, then my first guess would be that she might not be cognizant enough to initiate such a suit. I smell greedy parents/lawyers behind this, as are behind many lawsuits.<p>Second, we have to look at the availability of genetic screen tests available when the sperm was donated. I don't know how long sperm samples are kept, but lets be lenient and say the sample was donated no more than 2 years prior to the insemination. So what genetic tests were available commercially between 1994 and 1996? The tests were <i>way</i> less comprehensive than what we have available now. I think the open question is whether or not this was a genetic disorder that could even be screened for in that time period.<p>Ultimately it should boil down to ""Was it possible for the sperm bank to detect this genetic problem at the time of donation? If yes, did they have an internal policy to scan for such problems?"" If the answer to the first question is ""No"", then I don't see how there is a case. If the answer was ""Yes"" and the 2nd answer ""Yes"", then there is a case for negligence. If ""Yes"" and ""No"", then that's a grey area that can only be resolved via court action.<p>As an aside, I wonder what the mother's take on this is. If a person can sue a company for providing ""faulty"" genetic material, then can I sue my parents or grandparents if I inherit something life-threatening? Do we hold healthy individuals responsible if they have children, but inherit two recessive genes from both parents that results in some kind of disability?<p>I'm reminded of Gattaca, where the main character's love interest takes a sample of his hair to a walk-up lab for a genetic cross-screening, to see if there would be problems in the genes of potential children.",1239299075

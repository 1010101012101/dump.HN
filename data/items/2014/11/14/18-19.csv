The idea seems to be that if the money weren&#x27;t spent on a goal that is unlikely to be met (getting a drug approved for a rare cancer), then it could be spent on a goal that is more likely (getting a drug approved for a more common cancer). What &quot;hurts patients&quot; is that the latter is not happening. Dolgin is essentially claiming that if the former happened less, then the latter could happen more.<p>This might be true to some extent, but it is a fallacy -- often seen in discussions of governmental funding -- that if some money is not spent on item A, then that same amount will be available for item B. On the contrary, the emotional impact or political timeliness of item A might be what scared up the money in the first place. Furthermore, even the money is still available, the people who decide how to spend it might choose to spend it on options other than item B.<p>In any case, the general principle of targeting funding at projects that are actually likely to help people, seems to be a good one.",1415991278

I was just extending that idea out further;  I already know multiple people who have saved a few 100k a couple years out of college and are much, much less motivated by money now (vs the non-monetary payoffs that startups offer).

It&#x27;s true that Java doesn&#x27;t have language constructs that would let you do this as part of compilation, but Java has its ways. You could write an annotation processor to do this at compile time, or use a bytecode parser at runtime (this is yucky, but a fairly standard technique these days). Either way, the output would be a pair of synthetic classes which implemented the parser and encoder.

That would be a pretty sweet normal life.\nAdding an extra hour to the commute cuts your free time down by ~30%.  That is a big deal.<p>I also find it very helpful to include any time spent commuting as &quot;working time&quot; when considering where to work.  You should also consider the increased cost to commute from a more like this.  An extra hour of driving 5 days/week represents a non-trivial amount of money.  So the salary needs to compensate, or the time at the office needs to go down.<p>No matter how you look at this, a move like this is asking all of the employees on the short end of the stick to effectively take home less money (not exactly a pay cut, but the end result is the same).<p>Edit: oh and I&#x27;m not from SF, I live in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.

Sometimes small-n studies like the study reported here have IQ score differences between two groups that are simply the result of the test errors showing a difference where no actual difference exists. IQ tests are often also very frequently administered incorrectly or scored incorrectly even if correctly administered, magnifying the size of the error band around the obtained score.

At say 1% solar you don&#x27;t need any storage and it&#x27;s cost effective in most countries today.

At which point storage basically doubles your costs now and it only gets worse as solar gets cheaper.  Granted there are low cost utility scale solutions, but PV is still at low enough levels in most areas that it&#x27;s cheaper to simply store nothing and vary occasionally let excess power go to waste.<p>PS: The important thing to note is solar is cheap enough that even without any subsides the market is going to stick with a solar component anyway simply because that&#x27;s what&#x27;s cost effective.

In the 70&#x27;s and early 80&#x27;s, K-Mart gave a lot of autonomy to store managers to set sale prices and do promotions.  He would nearly always have loss-leader sales going for basic stuff like toothpaste and laundry detergent.  He assumed that if he could just get customers in the door for toothpaste, they&#x27;d buy enough other stuff to make up for the loss.  It worked, too.  After a while, many people didn&#x27;t even bother stopping by Target.   K-Mart finally forbade loss-leaders in the late 80&#x27;s, his sales tanked, and he quit to become a buyer for another chain.  The K-Mart is still there, but it&#x27;s a ghost town compared to Target and Wal-Mart.<p>I wonder if Wal-Mart can pull off the reverse of what my friend&#x27;s dad did.

Yes, they have authority to decide what is a drug and what is a supplement, but but <i>it&#x27;s clear they don&#x27;t exercise it aggressively</i>. It&#x27;s no good saying that &#x27;the FDA would never allow it&#x27; when there&#x27;s abundant evidence that in fact they allow it all the time. You can legally buy all sorts of unlicensed pharmaceuticals, you just can&#x27;t your doctor to write a prescription for them or your insurance company to cover the cost, which is obviously problematic for many people.<p><i>The thalidomide disaster had nothing to do with effectiveness of a drug. It had to do with safety, and the FDA did not approve thalidomide in the US prior to the 1962 amendments under their authority to require safety.</i><p>That doesn&#x27;t alter the possibility that it could have influenced the behavior of drug manufacturers.<p><i>Not really. The 1st world will be the customers where the money is, and those regulations will apply regardless of where a drug is developed. Secondly, investing billions producing a state-of-the-art lab in a 3rd world country is not something investors will be happy about - problems with any and all of corruption, unstable governments, security, clean water, reliable power, unskilled local labor, rampant crime, unpredictable regulatory environments, culture, etc.</i><p>All these potential problems are true, and yet Russia, India, and China all have growing pharmaceutical industries (to name but three) notwithstanding these problems and intermittent scandals (which cause western drugs to fetch a premium in China, for example, due to the public perception of being developed and manufactured to higher standards). Given the size of these countries and their demonstrably looser regulatory regimes, we ought to be seeing a lot of competitive products. India and China are certainly not such profitable markets for drugs as the US is, but the economic input costs are also lower so it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s no economic incentive to produce.<p>The problem I have with your argument is that it generalizes the effect of the 1962 amendments and their effectiveness provisions to the entire world, and you handwave away every objection by saying that the whole world is sufficiently like the USA that changes in FDA policy 50 years ago had a global inhibitory effect on drug development. This seems myopic, to say the least. I&#x27;m quite willing to buy the idea that Peltzman&#x27;s book provides a good illustration of how changes in the regulatory environment affected the US pharmaceutical industry (while disputing that this would be the only factor), but as I said in the first place it was published 40 years ago and I&#x27;m extremely skeptical of your suggestion that we can ignore 40 years of technological and economic change.",1415989329

8608528,comment,8606445,8606445,0,0,matthewmcg,,,"You need to distinguish between the VC fund and the VCs.<p>The VC fund is the entity that holds shares in the portfolio companies. The fund is purely long and unhedged. They try to minimize losses by being selective about their investments and negotiating contractual protections that reduce their downside risk (e.g. anti-dilution protection and redemption rights). But at the end of the day, they hope that their portfolio will include enough successful exits to cover losses and unsuccessful exits.<p>The VCs themselves are investment managers. They control the  investments of the fund and they are generally compensated based on (a) percentage of the assets under management and (b) a percentage of the return.<p>(a) is supposed to enable the management firm to pay staff and support the costs of finding and managing investments. (b) is supposed to incentive the managers to maximize returns to the limited partners providing capital to the fund. In practice it&#x27;s a bit muddier, as sometimes the managers will defer fees or co-invest in portfolio companies alongside their funds. But the basic idea is that the managers will make <i>some</i> money regardless of how the fund does, and they stand to make a lot more if the fund does well. You might cynically say the managers are &quot;hedged&quot; even though that is not strictly true.<p>A better question is whether venture capital (or private equity, for that matter) performs well as an asset class after all of these fees.

Coming into the office: after weeks and weeks, I develop a pattern. It's extremely different than my first week at work. My first week coming in to the office, I'm extremely punctual: I clock in at 10, and out at 6. I spend a good amount of my day interfacing with my Project Manager, talking to my fellow programmers, taking smoke breaks with them. Call of Duty, and NERF fights break out irregularly<p>Working from home: after weeks and weeks, I develop a pattern. I wake up early, 6 or 7, and start in on work or go to the gym. I may have four hours of uninterrupted work time before work ""officially"" starts. Maximum efficiency without interruption. I can ""come in to work early"" - 3-4 hours early - without feeling like I'm being taken advantage of, because I may stop working earlier than normal work hours. I usually don't, though -- my typical work weeks clock in at over 50 hours, and I'm the better for it. I'm learning when other people are sleeping.<p>I always ask my project manager and my director what's going on for the rest of the day to ensure I'm working when everyone else expects me to be. I have some flexibility in my schedule, and I try really hard to not abuse it. I give as much warning as I can that I'll be away from my computer. I took no days off from work last year except when I had to travel to SXSW because I was nominated for a web award and for when I had to have surgery/recovery for cancer.<p>iChat or Skype with video can <i>easily</i> solve the body language issue. ""Emoticons"" as horrid as they are, are invaluable in communication. Exclamation points, too. As outside my comfortability zone as it is, this statement: ""No problem kicking it out before Monday! :)"" communicates my situation far better than ""I can deliver by Monday"" does. Really, I don't mind putting in a few more hours over the weekend to ensure the project launches, but there's no way to communicate that without facial expressions or emoticons, so abuse the shit out of both.",1268110581

Our developers have worked together physically for 4 days total in the space of 2 years. There are issues, but I wouldn't call the situation better or worse, but rather different.

1177518,comment,1174714,1177267,0,0,mos1,,,"Frankly, I don't think there's a need to complicate this discussion with mentions of Keynes or interest rates.  Their error starts far earlier, at the basic measurement of value.<p>Joe works at WidgetCo and makes $60,000/yr.  His loaded costs are a little over $100,00/yr.<p>WidgetCo pays this because his skills are worth about $125,000/yr to them, so it's a great deal.<p>At this point, if you are a well-meaning, but rational cherub, what is the highest rational price to pay to get Joe working again?  I'm guessing anything up to $125,000.<p>----<p>But that's not the end of our grossly simplified model.  We also have the fact that Joe spends his paycheck on niggles.  He fucking loves the shit out of niggles.  As he consumes $60,000/yr of niggles, he personally pays for 1/2 of an employee at the niggle factory (and that guy spends his money on something too...)<p>So now we have to recognize that if Joe loses his job, there's going to be a negative ripple effect, and if Joe <i>gets</i> a job, there's a positive ripple effect.<p>So now, as a well-meaning, but rational cherub, what's my highest rational price?  Well.. at this point I'd probably call in an economist to help me figure it out, but it's clearly more than $125,000/yr... it's likely close to $200,000/yr.<p>----<p>And now somebody hands me a ""stimulus"" proposal, and it turns out that I could create a job for Joe for about $150,000/yr.  So let's see... $200,000/yr of value for $150,000/yr... sounds like a great investment to me!  Very good value for money, even if it does lead to an annoying headline indicating ""$60,000/yr jobs cost silly cherub $150,000!""<p>----<p>Obviously this is grossly glossed over (I didn't even mention the obvious fact that if people are buying widgets, they must provide value), and actual models of costs and benefits of various scenarios are quite complex, but I simply meant to demonstrate that simply dividing the total cost of a package by the number of jobs is silly, and misses the point widely.",1268110214

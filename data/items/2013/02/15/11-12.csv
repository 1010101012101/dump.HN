5225723,comment,5224339,5224567,1,0,relix,,,"There are dozens of possible ways to implement this in a distributed, atomic or near-atomic, low-impact way.<p>* One way is to have a list in Redis, just pop a dyno off it (atomic so each dyno is popped off exactly once), send the request to that dyno, and as soon as it's done, push the dyno back on the queue. 1RTT incoming, and let the dyno push itself back on after it's finished.<p>* Another way is to use sorted lists in Redis, increment/decrement the score based on the connections you're sending it/returning from it. Get the first dyno in line which will have the lowest score. This is harder but maybe more flexible.<p>* Presumably they already have a system in place in the router, that caches the dyno's a request to a particular app can be sent too, which includes detecting when a dyno has gone dead. Just use that same system but instead of detecting when it has gone dead, detect if it has more than 1 request waiting for it.<p>etc...<p>But in the end, 2-3 extra roundtrips for each inbound request is peanuts, that's the least of the problems with these ideas. That would add maybe 10ms? to each request. It's not like the servers are on the other side of the world. They're in the same datacenter connected by high-throughput cabling.",1360929520

5225720,comment,5225382,5225574,24,0,RyanMcGreal,,,"> We got NoSQL (esp. JSON based ones) instead of XML. Close enough though.<p>JSON is basically XML with 50% less bullshit. It does less but it does it so much more elegantly than XML - and has the further benefit of a syntax similar to that of structured data in such languages as Javascript (duh), Python and Ruby - that it was a shoo-in to squeeze XML out of most non-enterprise uses, at least on the data transfer format side.<p>However, to this day most data still resides in SQL databases, which have the net advantages of speed, stability and reliability that come from long lead time. What has changed is that object-relational mapping has gotten vastly better than it was in 2004, so programmers can mostly enjoy the best of both worlds.<p>There's also the fact that SQL is an easy enough DSL to understand, read and write that it isn't a barrier to use even in edge cases where ORMs fall down.",1360929472

5225704,comment,5224557,5224557,47,0,CodeMage,,,"This is certainly an interesting study, but I can't help being seriously disappointed by this part:<p><i>Sometimes when I hear people railing against porn, declaring it as the downfall of society, a poison infecting masculine minds and demeaning female ones, I wonder what kind of porn theyre talking about.<p>[...]<p>So when I hear somebody claim that porn is degrading, I cant help but ask: which porn?</i><p>If you think most porn isn't degrading, then you need to look a bit closer and think a little harder. I've already posted my views [1], but I'll copy & paste the relevant part here:<p><i>First of all, there's very little porn out there where the woman truly enjoys the experience. It's not always glaringly obvious (although we'll get back to that in the next point), but if you actually stop and look, you'll see the discomfort and/or indifference very often.<p>Second, a lot of porn out there focuses on and glorifies the woman's suffering, pain and degradation. Seriously, you only have to read the word ""painal"" once to realize that. However, if that's not enough, you might also look for the occurrences of ""choke"", ""gag"", ""destroy"", ""slut"", etc.<p>Third, even the porn that doesn't focus on pain teaches wrong stuff. One might get the idea that the only thing a man need do to make a woman enjoy sex is to pound her fast and hard. On top of that comes the whole issue of hygiene: the way anal is portrayed means that if you try it at home, your female partner will likely end up with an infection.<p>Fourth, it creates unrealistic expectations. Let's just say that gag reflex is not as easy to suppress as the porn makes you believe and that anal sex is not a matter of just sliding in any time you want.<p>TL;DR: No, it's not just about whether the sex if fun or boring.</i><p>Finally, I find the claim that ""female porn stars dictate the type of sex they have by listing in their modelling profiles the acts theyre willing to perform on camera"" to be disingenuous. It propagates the idea that everything is okay and whatever isn't okay is ""her fault"".<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4499803"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4499803</a><p>EDIT: Since I'm obviously not trolling, I was wondering whether anyone could help explain the drive-by downvoting.

5225699,comment,5222224,5223173,1,0,leoedin,,,"There is a lot of work going on to develop 3D printing as a mass manufacturing process. It is improving rapidly, but you have to understand that in the physical world progress is always slower than in software. 3D printing isn't a small change in manufacturing process (like more advanced CNC machining is) but a completely different approach. The level of investment, testing and iterating required to produce 3D printed components which demonstrate proven reliability and lower costs than existing processes is high.<p>The aerospace industry are actively pursuing 3D printing as a manufacturing process. Selective laser sintering allows shape-optimised parts to be built out of titanium - something that we cannot do any other way - which will lead to upwards of 50% weight savings. It will make a huge difference in the weight (and so efficiency) of aircraft. The issue is that the aerospace industry operates on the principal of proven heritage.

Now, keep in mind that you will most likely be learning a lot through challenges that arise - this is actually the fun part (in addition to the paycheck)!<p>By now, you probably know a few people in the business. Email, call, or perform any other forms of reaching out to these people. Google ""X freelance jobs in X city."" Update your LinkedIn. Go to local Meetups (meetup.com is great) and hand out business cards (these can actually be ordered cheaply via internet sales).

Spend some time watching videos of the 2011 Thoku earthquake and tsunami and what I'm most struck with is how long people act as if things are normal.  Granted it took several tens of minutes for the tsunami waves to reach shore after the earthquake, and even then several minutes for the tsunami to reach full strength.<p>Technological, fiscal, and other crises are similar.  Often your first real sign of trouble isn't a sense of impending doom as just a very strong sense that things are <i>wrong</i> -- your perception of the world isn't adding up.

Firstly, VB was (is?) a perfectly good solution for producing functional systems which solve problems. It's not very nice, but to say that it doesn't bring you closer to what you wanted is downright false. It does - that's why so many functional applications are written in it.<p>Secondly, I'd argue that the same statement applied to 3D printers is also false. Just because the output of hobby level plastic extruding printers is limited to certain shapes and materials doesn't mean that the process as a whole is flawed. I've played around with titanium springs, brackets and other interestingly shaped pieces which simply couldn't be produced by any other manufacturing process. 3D printing (in particular selective laser sintering) is going to produce a step change in the aerospace industry.<p>Finally, as an aside hobby and low cost plastic 3D printers are very useful for some applications. Producing brackets and mounting plates is considerably streamlined with a 3D printer. It's a useful technology for particular applications.

511591,comment,511038,511446,0,0,davo11,,,"Why would it be a cage? Isn't the idea of a free society is that it is a society? A group of responsible adults could agree that events could occur which result in people having to live on the streets for no reason of their own. I agree with some forethought these events could be planned for, but this is the sense of noblesse oblige. It recognises that not all people in the community are able to plan with the same level of forethought, and that the resources they have to work with will forbid this level of planning. And so a wealthy society can afford to look after all people if they so desire. If they wish to opt of the safety net then that is fine, I don't see how it's a cage.",1236772735

511586,comment,511538,511538,0,0,lionhearted,,,"I agree with the article's conclusion, but not necessarily its premise. Not sure ""Hauser's Law"" stands up, or is it just statistical coincidence?<p>But yes, raising tax rates can certainly decrease tax yields. Take one of my closest friends. He's 28 now. He's a college dropout, and self-made millionaire as of age 24. Amazing guy. He was grossing about $800,000/year in his age 24/25/26 years. He was netting out mid/low six figures, and paying $50,000-$150,000 each year in various taxes. Working (no kidding) 80+ hour weeks. Often more.<p>I've seen people cite the top marginal tax rate as being in the 90% range post WWII. But mobility has increased so much since then. My friend is an incredibly resourceful dude, as you can imagine. He's a good person. America wants him here, or at least should. But if the government now wanted, after writeoffs, interest deduction from taxes, etc, say... $400,000 per year from him - he'd be long gone. There's enough countries where you can get a ""welcomed exceptional people"" visa by putting enough money in the bank, or a resident's visa by buying a property. Dubai being one such place.<p>So yeah, he'd be long gone if the government wanted to tax him more. Now, I can't speak to whether that's fair, or right, or if he's neglecting his patriotic duty by not being willing to stick around in the USA even if it wasn't a smart move for him financially. But it's the way it is. He grits his teeth and pays what he has to because he reckons he'll make more money here doing it that way. If that were to change, I reckon I'd be visiting him in Hong Kong, Dubai, or wherever else pretty fast. He and I both travel pretty regularly, and both of us have lived abroad some. Heck, I'd probably leave if taxes got high enough too.",1236772366

This also falls in line with the fact that the initial idea isn't that important.  Often the initial idea is useful only because it leads you to discover a tough problem.  The tough problem is the sharp tap.  Some people fall down bleeding, other people explode.<p>Of course sometimes all that energy gets misdirected (wall street sucking up intelligent college grads anyone?) and we quite literally shoot ourselves in the foot.  Creative, productive people have a lot of energy inside them.  How that energy is directed can be perverted.",1236771590

511577,comment,511539,511539,0,0,lionhearted,,,"This is gold. Almost everyone new to entrepreneurship makes this mistake (not setting very clear expectations early on in a business), and it sucks. Here's the comment I left on the site:<p>--<p>Very wise advice from someone whose already been there. Three more questions to think about:<p>1. Expenses: What is and is not an expense? Especially getting clear on business entertainment, business travel, ""general life expenses that are also business expenses"" like internet access, and so on. Also, what's the max dollar amount someone can spend on an expense without checking with the other person? My default advice is keep business expenses low and stick to the necessary. For a first company, say no to business entertainment, business travel, meals, general life expenses, and any hardware that a person would use for non-business reasons.<p>2. Profit distribution: When and how will profits be distributed? How much will be reinvested? What will the reserves be? What if one partner wants or needs cash, and the other wants to put it into expanding? This is an important question, and potentially contentious. Especially if your business is growing and money is coming in, but founders are in different places financially. Especially a point of contention if one founder is heavy in unsecured debt, and the other isn't.<p>3. Hours: When (not if) the hours you're working get unbalanced, how to handle that? Less an issue if it's both of your full time gigs and you're putting in full time effort each. Very important to think about if it's a side project or people have other obligations. The way I've seen work is that you define roles clearly to be completed on a plan to profitability, and once you're profitable, founders draw salary for regular, recurring work they do that's at market rates. If upkeep on the business after it's built successfully takes 15 hours/week, but lends itself to one founders skillset so he's doing 12 hours per week, you're going to have an issue really soon. Instead, that founder can get paid at around market rates, or you can outsource that part of his job.<p>Those are three I've seen issues with - unclear expectations on hours, profit distribution, and expenses. You've obviously been there Daniel, very nicely written up mate.",1236771573

I think there is a cognitive bias involved in not examining too closely the exact methods of a leader who tells you that he will get more resources for the tribe.  We prefer to think of ourselves and project an image of empathy and community, but the most effective tribes were those that killed others and stole their resources.  So we like to gloss over the details because it allows us to maintain our self image.

If it doesn't start to click, then come back after a few years of imperative programming, at which time it won't be as easy as you'd expect (or so it is reported) since you have to learn the very different functional paradigm, but you'll appreciate it all the more having accumulated plenty of scars from side effect caused bugs.<p>That said, if you have something you want to build starting with a project and an appropriate language and ecosystem (including instructional material) is very good.  I myself started out in a high school punched card IBN 1130 FORTRAN ""IV"" course, but soon started a project that really got me going.<p>I didn't try SICP until half a decade later; by then I was an experienced imperative language programmer (mostly C by that point) and fairly experienced in Maclisp and Lisp Machine Lisp.  At which point it really made sense, both in terms of being able to understand the material and why it was really important.",1282049980

You can get education, and you can get resources.  But as the poster from South Africa wrote, you also have objectivity and see ""real problems"" all around you.  With your objectivity, looking up someone's email across social sites doesn't feel like an important problem, so it's less likely to get solved from the third world.<p>That said, Africa also gives rise to an incredibly positive cultural acclimation--fixing things with whatever's on hand.  That's an extraordinary talent if applied philosophically and pragmatically, allowing one to invent and solve around the barriers you mention.  That's ""hacking"".",1282049965

For me, the ease with which I can bang out scripts and makefiles and have the tools easily check out versioned code from rcs/svn and that I can pipe and redirect and have a host of efficient tools like grep and nm and objdump and more, and they all work together piping and redirecting to make exactly what I want in so many easily altered configurations. Release and debug and partial debug and static-checking build and more, with all the makefiles just text - so easy to alter and tweak and copy and share (and even have them configure on the fly, reading the output from the compilation and rerunning with extra warnings or debug symbols) and have them run commands themselves like sending eMails to everyone who is listed as an interested party on the source controlled spec list, and so much more.

Best practices?",,"I'm in the process of getting a SaaS app ready for launch, and one of the last components is the billing module. We're going to be using Braintree for our processing, and our expected subscription rate will be $10 / month.<p>To reduce the likelihood of fraud, credit card billing companies say you should get lots of billing data, like the user's address, their CVV code, the name on the card, and so on. But the more fields that are present, the more friction there is for the user to enter in their data. Also, the more opportunities for fat-fingering the entry and creating validation errors of some sort.<p>I notice that 37signals only asks for three pieces of information: credit card number, expiration date, and billing ZIP code. This is going to put their charges into the ""unqualified"" rate level, I believe, as it's not getting the billing address, CVV, or other elements that reduce the likelihood of fraud. At the same time, my understanding is that most business credit cards are considered ""unqualified"" anyway, so it might be moot. I know that, as a user, I'm much more of a fan of the 37signals approach, where I don't have to fill in loads of data.<p>Have any of you experimented with different amounts of data-collection and seen how that's affected either your chargeback rate, your conversion rate, or your bottom line?

Didn't make as grand of statements as maybe are being made now, but the idea was the same.<p>Observably, your brain pulses EM waves at certain frequency ranges depending on your state of mind, pretty much the calmer your mind, the slower your waves.<p>Now, if you've meditated with any type of success, you will recognize that semi-deep meditation is definitely similar in some ways to being on drugs.. the way marijuana treats some people, and I think even closer to how opiates treat people; a very relaxed, accepting feeling that is distinct from normal beta-wave activity.<p>Disclaimer, I have not read the wired article nor listened to any of these 'digital drug' mp3s; but.. I am pretty confident our brains can be strongly encouraged to enter the different brain-wave states based off the pulsations of sound at the intended interval.<p>That is, by overloading our senses into a pulsation at a certain frequency, our brains have inertia to pulsate at that frequency, thus putting our selves in the different states of mind associated with the different brain states.<p>My guess is that is what is happening with these 'digital drugs' and the ones that are supposedly 'the best' will have overwhelming rhythms matching probably alpha/delta wave frequency.",1282047386

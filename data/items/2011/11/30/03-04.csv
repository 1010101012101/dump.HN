3293621,comment,3292310,3292944,2,0,dorian-graph,,,"Most people are always 'jealous' whether it be of people who are great at singing, playing an instrument, videogames, or something, yet they really don't seem to care or desire that and often they feel negative towards those people. It seems everything in their lives revolves around watching others do things (Reality TV shows, magazines, news stories, etc) and little to do with their actual selves.<p>They don't want to be in a good conversation, they want to have an average conversation where everyone agrees on some average opinion or every now and then someone will be 'edgy' to give it a bit of flair.<p>They don't want to understand good art they simply want to say that one of their kids once went to an art gallery and that they saw know that Picasso has weird/funny looking paintings.<p>This sounds elitist yet it's not. From school age and possibly even before the majority latches onto the dumb notion that if a kid studies well he's a teacher's pet and weird or some other term and they never let go of this idea. Ever. At university one of the subjects was systems analysis and design which came with a huge textbook. I read some of it each week that aligned with that week's lecture/tutorial content and people said that's weird.<p>.. but all this is like endlessly driving on a roundabout because what it means to be weird and normal differs though does have a common understanding. A common understanding is that 'normal' is not being the best or putting in the best effort. They should just start saying average instead of normal. For me, all those people they call weird are the normals ones as they're doing it right.<p>The ones who exercise are normal and the ones who sit around are weird. The ones who do the homework are normal and the ones who don't are ridiculously weird. It's like they want to ignore cause and effect and modify the universe to suit their quick whims for instant desires. What a bunch of weirdos.",1322625518

It seems quite relevant to this discussion.<p>The authors compare the leadership at companies that consistently outperformed their competitors during good times and bad, with the leadership at the nominally-performing companies.<p>The outperforming leaders set a benchmark defining ""consistent progress"", e.g. profitable every year (Southwest Airlines), 20% growth per year (Stryker), etc. They then fought to achieve that benchmark even during the toughest years (perhaps obvious), but they also restrained themselves so as to not exceed (by much) their benchmark during the ""boom"" years. Even though it might seem counter-intuitive, these ""restrained"" companies performed better over the long run than those companies which grew quickly during the good times.<p>The point is perhaps that you might achieve more by both committing to, and limiting yourself to, some more reasonable number of hours per week.",1322625366

She passed the interview with flying colors, way beyond my expectations, and I was a bit ashamed to tell her the maximum budget I had - it was much less than someone with her experience was worth. She seemed more than happy to take my offer (which was as far as I could possibly go). Later I learned I was paying her more than 4 times what she earned as a researcher at the university. I don't know whether her male colleagues earned much more, but I was shocked by how little she made as a scientist.<p>To this day I am bittersweet about this. I am embarrassed I never paid her what she deserved - and I should have, for she is an outstanding professional - but I am also happy I helped her transition from an dead-end job at an academic institution to a fast-paced tech company and that this transition had a very positive impact on her career (last time I heard, she had a team of kick-ass programmers solving some devilishly hard computer-vision-related problem).

They've since introduced dozens of features that have gotten everyone upset (or at least a sizable enough minority to be noticeable). They make it clear that ads are targeted based on your personal information. They make privacy settings complicated. They continuously push you to supply more information, connect with more people, use Facebook for more things. They continuously make more things public by default, and add more features that make personal information discoverable (such as tagging in images).<p>If they weren't suspicious, they wouldn't have been investigated in the first place.<p>I'm not talking about a time machine. But let me observe a few things:<p>- I deleted my account a year ago (and knew I wanted to before that) without the FTC investigating anything. Because Facebook was clearly suspicious.<p>- You still have an account today even though you know about Facebook's lies today. You don't need a time machine to make changes today.<p>My argument is this:<p>Fraud protection is extremely important. There are many cases where there is no suspicion of fraud, no source of information about possible fraud, and consumers get taken advantage of. For example, people get taken advantage of by phishing every day.<p>But if you fall victim to increasingly bad phishing attacks from the same company over the course of years, you aren't paying attention. You are relying on watchmen to protect you and not watching out for yourself.<p>I am not blaming the victim. I am trying to empower the victim. Everyone who is reading this and still has a Facebook account knows that Facebook will outright lie about privacy in order to make more money from advertisers. They are still guilty of their actions if you get fooled again, but <i>you don't have to get fooled again.</i><p>My argument is ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.""",1322625140

However, the idiomatic ways of doing things in Scala tend to be very bad for performance if you're in a tight loop.  For example, if you have two arrays that you need to iterate through simultaneously, you need to zip them together.  In order to regain the performance, you end up having to do something like the while loop or use recursion.  This is similar to the problem of doing heavily numeric code in Clojure before release 1.3.  You could get Java-like numeric performance out of Clojure, but you'd have to abandon doing it in any sort of ideal way.<p>One example where something was impossible in Scala is that to implement a Parcelable for Android.  This requires the creation of a static field, which Scala doesn't allow.  Now, I won't argue that an API that requires such a construct is <i>good</i>, but it might be necessary for your application.  I believe Scala now contains special code in the compiler just to support this peculiarity in the Android API.",1322623408

I expect that the problems of these languages (including performance) are going to become much less major over time, just as performance gaps between Java and C and between C and hand-written assembly have nearly disappeared.<p>Spending another 5 years in Java means you're preparing yourself for a 1996 job in 2016.<p>Why Scala and Clojure? Unfortunately, the 10-year forecasts for Haskell and Ocaml aren't great. I wish they were, because those are great languages. The reason: libraries and tooling matter, and they seem to be mattering <i>more</i> as the years pass (while differences in performance between languages narrow and matter less over time).<p>Hiring and talent: It's true that you can't hire 50 Scala programmers per month. On the other hand, most startups are far away from being in a position to hire 50 programmers per month at all, much less 50 good ones. Choosing an ""esoteric"" language works both ways. On one hand, it reduces the total pool of ready developers. On the other hand, I know companies that use Haskell and Ocaml and are able to hire 60-75% of their in-office interviewers while remaining selective; this would be impossible for a Java shop-- there are just too many unqualified Java developers.

Most of the multiple key agreement protocols do not utilize the hash functions in the signature schemes used for identification. Not using hash function in these protocols causes that the protocols do not satisfy some requirement security properties. In this paper we review the multiple key agreement protocols and perform attacks on some of them. Then we introduce a new multiple key agreement protocol and show that the proposed protocol is more secure than the existent multiple key agreement protocols.<p>Introduction\nCryptography helps us to make a secure communication in public networks. The secret key plays an essential role in the cryptosystems such that revealing the secret key causes the cryptographic system to be compromised. Therefore how to exchange the secret key is very important in cryptographic applications. One of the considerable methods for secret key exchanging is key agreement protocols. These protocols enable two or more users of any public\nnetworks to share a secret common key together.",1322622265

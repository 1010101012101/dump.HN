If Ted & and mark were equally intelligent/smart, and knowing that ted worked hard to do better than his collegues , Soon he would have been the ""go to member of his team"". and mark would remain the networking guy.<p>Felt this article assumes Mark is double smart. i.e he can network, see & improve what other departments are doing & be the ""go to member"" of the team.",1261568734

A single swallow does not make a spring.<p>As an aside, this concept of Asian Intellectualism to me has always sounded hollow. My experience has been that Asian students especially Indian students tend to favour learning-by-rote over critical thinking which requires large amounts of time spent memorising things versus understanding them. The school and university exams in India tend to emphasise that as well.",1261568102

In fact there are plenty of companies doing so. You just have to include the source.<p>You might find this less attractive for your (commercial) goals and needs, but I find it quite attractive and important to have access to the source and the possibility to alter or enhance the software I use, while preventing freeloading (not quite true with GPL, see services as a loophole, AGPL is actually even better at preventing freeloading) to a certain degree.",1261568041

Very nice language (I like the syntax much better than the C-like languages) and tools.<p>If you're going to do this, there is one very important tip: use psyco. It ( <a href=""http://psyco.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psyco.sourceforge.net/</a> ) magically speeds up all Python execution by about 3-4x. In one of my games ( <a href=""https://sourceforge.net/projects/slasha/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sourceforge.net/projects/slasha/</a> , still in its early stages) the millisecond per frame count went from 25-300 to 15-80 (drawing the desktop seems to take an unavoidable 7-10 ms).<p>As for what you learn doing this kind of thing, you use trigonometry a lot, you use the pythagorean theorem a lot, my game here is the way I thought up of the pathfinding algorithm.",1261566803

To make far-reaching policy decisions based on doctored data and questionable analysis would be criminal. Until there is an open, solid scientific basis for the AGW hypothesis absolutely nothing should be undertaken along the lines of what these people suggest. There are other serious environmental issues (like contamination) which deserve far more attention; they are understood and well documented. AGW at the moment looks like a scam. It is a good thing the Chinese couldn't be bought off or tricked by the fraudsters.",1261566403

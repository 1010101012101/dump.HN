141533,comment,141460,141460,0,0,Shooter,,,"Is anyone here using Scala in a production environment?  We've had to start using Java (ick) on some projects and I would love to be able to target the JVM and use Java libraries without actually having to code in Java.  Just like a few hundred thousand other developers ;-)<p>I really like the looks of both Clojure and Scala, but I haven't had the chance to experiment with either yet.  Scala is obviously further along in development...but I'm not sure if we could risk either on our project.  The Schemes on the JVM aren't production ready yet IMO, unfortunately, and Jython/ JRuby/ Groovy will also not work for us for various reasons (execution speed, bugs, etc.)<p>Any words of wisdom from Scala trailblazers?",1206002696

141531,comment,141439,141508,0,0,hbien,,,"It's yet another gtd web app.  It's web based because almost all of the apps I use are web based now.  Plus, the entire application is a single Ajax page with optional Google Gears integration (everything works offline).  There's also an API that I used to make a command line client and to hook with TextMate.<p>One of the best strengths of self-hosted web apps are plugin systems (ie. Mint's peppers) which is something I'm working on.<p>So I guess it's not that unique because there are tons of GTD applications.  But the users who do use GTD apps tend to be more tech savvy.",1206002501

To that end, it will benefit you to appear to have (and to have) your own things going on: ask questions that will tell you how to accomplish your future goals.  For instance, if you're a programmer and you're interested in startups, ask about entrepreneurship on campus, on-campus attitudes around that, etc.  Similarly, do not ask how you can best prepare for college -- college isn't/shouldn't be a destination.",1206002343

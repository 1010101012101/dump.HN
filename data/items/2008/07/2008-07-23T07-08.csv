But that does not mean that I do not know how hard it is to raise kids.<p>You <i>really</i> don't know how hard it is to raise kids. And with all due respect, just so you know, kids <i>are not</i> startups.",1216799871
254162,comment,254091,254159,0,0,shawndrost,,,"""my hometown of Whistler BC"" -- ah, okay.  You can try for the same effect via irc, try #startups on freenode.net.  (<a href=""http://www.mibbit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mibbit.com</a> lets you use irc via your browser.)  You can also start a tech meetup, it's a lot easier than it looks, and you might be surprised at who shows up.  Email local web developers, etc, sniff for interest.  It might also be worth your time to take a trip to vancouver when there's something cool happening -- aside from the direct benefits of feedback, etc, it's really motivating.",1216799799

However, you should put the markers on the map: it's not going to be the basis for the decision about which show I'm going to, but it looks good, and it helps the user, and it doesn't hurt anything.",1216799447

I'm not being lazy, but just haven't been getting that kind of feedback - tech meetups are not de rigueur in my hometown of Whistler BC.<p>I'm not a huge fan of the look, and i've been tweaking and tweaking it. Even hired a designer, but we conflicted on a bunch of elements and this is what I ended up with.<p>It's a shame the player isn't working. I haven't heard that yet, and that is the best part - listen so you can discover the artists.<p>I specifically didn't want to populate the map with markers as it would just be full of markers, and you won't really decide to go to a show based on where it is, rather than who is playing, so I think the site would get just too busy with that.<p>But I'll definately be working on everything else you mentioned. Kinda makes me wish I could take down this post for now and repost later. ;)",1216799329

254155,comment,254091,254141,0,0,pedalpete,,,"Thanks Maro,<p>I had the map smaller originally, but the bigger map just seems more engaging. I do put markers on the map after you click on a result. I thought it would be useless to have a bunch of markers on the map first, as you aren't going to decide on a show based on the location, but it's good to see the location after.<p>Thanks for the input.",1216798996
254154,comment,254091,254091,0,0,smanek,,,"Pretty cool in principle. The IP geodetection thing is really great.<p>I agree that the layout could use a lot of work. It's rather difficult to use on my X60 (1024x768 resolution).<p>Also, the filtering is very nice, but there's still a bit of information overload for me since there are over a hundred shows playing near where I live, in the genres I'm interested in, on a random saturday.<p>An extra feature that may be help alleviate that problem could be integration with some other site/service/application that already knows my musical tastes. For example, I've already spent a fair amount of time telling iTunes, Last.fm, pandora, and facebook what I like. It would be great if you could leverage that to provide me with a better filter.",1216798733

254151,comment,254091,254091,0,0,shawndrost,,,"Congratulations!  I love the idea of skimming myspace's events so that I don't have to look at their site and use the doubtlessly terrible search function they have.<p>Cut the adwords and the digg/share widgets.  They're not going to get you money or traffic, respectively, and they look trashy.<p>The list of upcoming shows looks terrible: the left edge doesn't line up with the left edge of the div above it, and the inset scroll doesn't match the rest of the look/feel, and I'm seeing a pixel's worth of one element and it looks like a glitch.  This needs a lot of work.<p>Use a normal dropdown for the 'playing' menu: inconsistent UI elements are bad, and that one would be bad even if it weren't inconsistent.<p>Populate the map with markers immediately rather than waiting till someone clicks on an artist.<p>The music player isn't working for me: standard ff3/windows.<p>Your fonts feel inconsistent: pick a bold typeface for titles/buttons/logo, and a plain typeface for standard text.<p>Most of what I'm saying is really basic stuff, so honestly, I suspect you're doing something basic wrong.  If you've heard it a bunch of times before, you're either being lazy or stubborn.  If not, you're not asking for enough feedback from friends, family, at tech meetups, etc.",1216798185
254150,comment,254131,254147,0,0,lisper,,,"Dwight Eisenhower famously said, ""Plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.""<p>My point is that it is NOT impossible to plan for.  Many aspects of having kids are quite predictable, including all the issues that the OP was asking about.  I've tweaked the blog post a bit to hopefully make this clearer.<p>P.S. And maybe I don't really know how hard it is to raise kids. It may well be even harder than I imagine. But that doesn't change the fact that anyone who waits until two months after the kid is born to figure out who is going to take care of it has not planned ahead adequately.",1216797818

The response was ""it's impossible to plan for"" and your answer again is ""you should plan ahead"".<p>And I actually do think the fact that you don't have kids does mean you don't know how hard it is.  (It's like me saying I know the physical act of childbirth is hard, but I think it's certainly not the same as me going through it.)",1216797324

254143,comment,253682,253682,0,0,saundby,,,"I'm religious, but I'm seldom willing to discuss it in technical forums because of the responses it draws. Specifically those who feel it their mission to, first, tell me what it is I must believe, then, tell me why it's foolish to believe those things.<p>There are a lot of folks who feel tech forums are an appropriate place to make atheistic comments or anti-religious statements, probably because they feel like they're among a receptive audience. I think this gives an unbalanced impression of how far the split is to one side or the other. For myself, I just ignore the statements. It's not about what I'm in a tech forum for. And I don't consider it any more indicative of where the group mind is than statements on, say, film preferences.",1216796757

I was instantly intrigued to see what was going on because I connected with seeing the familiarity of the map despite the unfamiliarity of the site.  I think with a little work on the layout it could be very cool.",1216796557

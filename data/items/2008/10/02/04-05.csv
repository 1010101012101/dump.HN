Also bear in mind, dividends paid by most corporations are taxable as long-term capital gains as opposed to income tax.<p>All in all, a solid bet by Buffet.

Don't they understand that people will lose their jobs if my startup becomes illiquid?<p>Edit: I rescanned the bill looking for language like ""funds in support of collaborative server support technologies"", still nothing!!!  Does anyone have the phone number for the lobbyist that works for the Boy Scouts?  I could use some advice.",1222922888

For those who haven't checked it out before, it's an online whiteboard with a completely reinvented UI (""a digital whiteboard that doesn't suck"").<p>The feedback was amazing (useful in terms of features and motivating as well), and -if you haven't seen the site in a while- you probably will discover that a lot of your feedback has been incorporated. Thanks again!<p>One of the obvious features is to have a developer API. Dabbleboard makes more sense when integrated with other communication and collaboration services. As a standalone app, its usefulness is limited.<p>Please give us feedback (either as a comment here, or by email) regarding anything about Dabbleboard. Though of course I'm hoping you'll evaluate/use the API and have feedback about it in particular :).",1222922643

People (at least myself, and I presume many/most others) can't be arsed to take the time to add tags that nobody will ever really see.

321414,comment,321361,321361,0,0,jhancock,,,"Encrypted comm channels, tunneling, and anon networks are tools we hackers are good at utilizing.  There are many solutions that enable these tools for ""joe user"".  The problem is that any solution I can think of that simplifies privacy for the end user is fairly easily blocked by a government that controls the network.<p>I think it comes down to the fact that if you're a great tool-smith, you can have some privacy.  Others get to be monitored or blocked.<p>Note: my opinion is based on my experience as an American living in Shanghai for 8 years.",1222922427

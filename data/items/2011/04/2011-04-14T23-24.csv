2448937,comment,2446418,2447170,3,0,spc476,,,"The Amiga was unique when it came out due to its custom sound and graphic chips that placed it beyond any existing home computer at the time (1985).  Unfortunately, the hardware didn't change all that much and was slowly eclipsed first by graphics (VGA came out 1987 offering more colors) and then sound (SoundBlasters in the early 90s).<p>The other issue was the operating system, which is really three pieces---Exec, DOS and Intuition.  Exec is the kernel, written in 68000 assembly and appears as just another shared library to the system (neat design really).  It's small (I was able to recreate over half of it in C in just a few hours) and would have been able to keep up as is until multiprocessor cores became popular, which would have required a somewhat major change (critical sections were handled by literally disabling task switching).  It also has no notion of users (being a single user machine).<p>DOS, the file system.  This itself was a port of a portion of Tripos (written in BCPL) which only took two weeks to do (or four; it was a really short period of time).  It's a bit quirky (due to it being written in BCPL) but it worked and given the nature of device drivers in the Amiga (a combination of shared library and a potential thread) it could easily support other file systems rather transparently.  This is probably the least problematic aspect of the operating system to update for modern machines.<p>And finally Intuition, the GUI.  This was written in C, and unfortunately, was rather closely tied to the underlying hardware.  Not only could you specify a new screen (different screen resolution and color depth) but access to the blitters (which were also used by the floppy disk drivers to decode the bit stream I kid you not) and even the raw video co-processor (a three-instruction CPU that could be used to reset the video registers at an almost arbitrary portion of the video scanning beam).  Some of the upper layers of Intuition were fairly video independent but not enough of it to survive a major redesign of the video subsystem.<p>You're pretty much right in that it was a ""nice computer"" (I found it really fun to program) but it didn't evolve all that much while on the market.  Exec would need some work to work on today's multicore hardware and Intuition would have to be reworked from the ground up.",1302825196

It's not terribly surprising that Rackspace is performing better in that area.<p>What you need to be careful about is the fact that EC2 and Rackspace Cloud are currently in two different leagues when it comes to controlling your instances. Amazon has a far better control panel (not to mention the API) for exercising granular control of your instances. Hard drive space is dynamically scalable on Amazon whereas it is not on Rackspace (their solution of mounting Rackspace Cloud Files via FUSE is unacceptable).<p>The monitoring system for EC2 is also far better, and completely non-existent on Rackspace unless you pay them $99/mo out of pocket on top of your hourly usage charges.<p>All in all, my Rackspace experience left a very bad taste in my mouth when dealing with their support, and it was a culmination of the small and simple things that left me frustrated (the lack of pv_grub support out of the box, etc., etc.) and kept me on EC2 despite the lack of CPU bursting.",1302824978

My machines were rebooted all the time and I would receive e-mails saying they were rebooted by Rackspace because of infrastructure issues or maintenence. I'd say this happened once every 2-3 weeks and I was only running 3 servers. This was a hobby project so to have to drop what I was doing every 2-3 weeks to reinitialize a server was a huge pain. I eventually shut it all down and switched to Linode just so I didn't have to worry about them randomly rebooting my machines all the time.<p>I've ran much larger clusters on EC2 over the last several years (50+ servers) and can count on my fingers the times that machines have been rebooted.

If they did then you might say:<p>There is a nuclear reactor near here.<p>If there is a 9+ magnitude quake with a matching tsunami then the water surge will probably kill you. If you survive that you may have to evacuate for a couple of months while we get the nuclear plant back into a stable configuration. This has never happened in recorded history but it is possible.<p>Are you sure you want to buy/rent this house and live here?<p>Hammock your statement ""Nuclear accidents on the other hand are something that we can prevent, either by more robust disaster planning, or by not having nuke plants in sensitive areas to begin with."" implies that we haven't prevented them, when in fact we have. Japan has had very large earthquakes before and their nuclear facilities have come through unscathed. This particular event will, in all likelyhood, kill no one out right and probably not change the life expectancy in any measurable way for more than a handful of people. So while the statistically amazingingly unusual earthquake + tsunami got through the back up cooling system defenses, the 'worst possible' scenario you might imagine, and no one has been killed? I'm pretty sure most people would take that bet and decide to live there.<p>They would be even more likely if they realized that just flying on a commercial airliner once a year has a better chance of killing them.<p>I understand the fear that radiation induces in people, they can't see it, they feel like they can be 'dead' already and not know it, and there really isn't a good way to hide from it (unless perhaps you have a lead lined shelter). But it is more of a phobia than a rational fear. There are many places you can live where there is no risk of a nuclear accident and if a person's phobia is strong, they may choose to live there, just as people who fear of heights may choose to live in single story structures.<p>There is however an even bigger threat, for which we completely understand the threat and are not doing a damn thing about. Yup, the bad news is that pretty much anywhere on the planet you can be killed by an Asteroid impact [1] which, surprisingly, is about as likely than a 9+ quake and a tsunami [2].<p>And perhaps more telling, given the inverse square law, you can actually build a shelter that is impervious to any event at any reactor for any given distance, but you can't do that for a space rock.<p>[1] <a href=""http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/</a><p>[2] Paleoseismic evidence shows that great earthquakes or earthquake couplets occur about every 230 years (<a href=""http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~sieh/publications/a10.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~sieh/publications/a10.html</a>).",1302822984

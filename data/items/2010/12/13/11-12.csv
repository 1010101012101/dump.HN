2000158,comment,1999312,1999654,0,0,zizee,,,"We've been learning recently that we should have started building relationships with bloggers, media and potential customers a long time ago. I say ""learned recently"" but we really knew it all along as it is such oft repeated advice in the startup world.<p>Unfortunately we kept putting it off because developing the product felt a lot more tangible and progress came easily. The same cannot be said for building meaningful relationships that can be used as a launchpad come launch day.<p>So, my advice (which echoes so many other voices around HN): start writing about the space you are in. Start building real relationships with bloggers. Start a mailing list to collect email addresses. Start joining forums that are in your domain and build a rep. These things take a while to cultivate and you want to be able to harvest at launch.<p>As for SEO, get the basics sorted (domain registration, keyword heavy landing page etc), but don't spend too much time on it. The real SEO power comes from getting quality links. These only come when you have those relationships with bloggers etc pumping.<p>Goodluck with the launch!<p>-James (Carlo's partner in crime)<p>(edited for typos)",1292241556

Unless you honestly think you're going to nab a position on the CEO's staff (which is possible, but unlikely) you should try to get an intro to the person(s) most likely to be able to make you an actual job offer.<p>I've seen variants of your situation several times in the past.  CEO meets someone, is impressed in some manner, passes the contact over to the lower-level person, that person has no time/interest/need for candidate and the process halts, usually after initial expectations were high.<p>I'll also say I find it a touch odd that after this single experience you find it necessary to post the whole thing here.<p>tldr; you have some experience, you pursued 1 job opportunity which wasn't even an actual open position req. and then you didn't get hired.<p>You could fill 100 HN sites with 1000 variants of that exact same story EVERY DAY.<p>Again, not trying to be harsh, just trying to filter the reality out of this, which is yours is a very non-noteworthy experience in life.",1292241407

2000087,story,,,31,40,coryl,"Tell HN: I can't even get a job offering to work for free",,"This is a short, funny but tragic story about my quest for a job. (Apologies for the length and writing style, its half story / half venting).<p>Background: I’m 23, graduated last year with a business degree. I have a bunch of startup experience, having projects mentioned on Techcrunch, TIME, CNet, CBSNews, and more. After a summer of working on a startup with my friend and technical partner, he decided to get a job with one of the big mobile handset developers. That left me with a choice; do something on my own (with limited technical ability) or get a job and learn something.<p>In September, I decided to give it shot and sent email out to the CEO of a local startup. I figured I wanted to be a part of the growing social product space, so a social analytics company made sense. I kidd you not, the subject of my email was “I want to work for you for free!”. It worked, and I got the attention I wanted. I recall the skype conversation we had later that week. We went over my life story, and he complimented, even gushed over me. “Wow, you guys are rockstars”, “I wish you would have told me sooner, I would have invested in you guys”, “You guys remind me of myself in the 90’s”, “This is exactly how I tell people to find jobs they want”. We traded business stories, discussed the local startup scene.  It was nice to hear, and it felt honest and sincere. If he liked me that much, then surely he would have something for me. I introduce him to my partner through email.<p>Soon after, I’m meeting the CEO and his #1 for the area (they have another office in California). My friend is also driving into the city later for dinner with the pair after work. We chat, he demos the product, tells me all about the operations and such. I refresh him about my crazy past projects. They ask me what I want to do as a role, I tell them I’m open and flexible. Money doesn’t matter to me, I just want the opportunity to learn and experience. “Okay then, we’ll you put you in touch with our marketing guy and see if he has anything for you”. I left feeling pretty happy and confident, having built a positive rapport and established a relationship with someone who “gets it”.<p>After another skype chat with the head of marketing, I’m even left with a weekend assignment; figure out what position I’d like to fill for the company, and give suggestions on what I’d do for the homepage and product. I indeed brainstorm my role (product development!) and even Photoshop a mockup of a new homepage design, just because I felt like it. But here’s where I failed to recognize the breakdown in communication; the responsibility of handling / recruiting ME, had passed on to a person I’d never met in a different coast. The buck had been passed, as it were. I’d been wiped clear of the conscience of the people I’d attracted from the beginning.\nWeeks would go by, I would get an occasional email saying “things are crazy, we’re setting Q1 goals.” Oh, the life of a startup I’d assume. Its ok, they’ll get to me eventually. All the while, they corresponded with my friend in the same manner. They were wooing him, and after working only 3 months at a multinational mobile phone developer, he would quit to accept their job offer. That happened this week, leaving me wondering if I should shoot them an email to get things rolling again. I did, and several hours ago, they replied.<p>“Oh, you didn’t get the email we sent last month? Please see the following:…” It was a rejection letter. A nicely worded, complimentary letter in which apparently I have “rare, entrepreneurial qualities that will make you successful” and that I should “keep trucking”.<p>Fuck me. 10 weeks of sitting and waiting, expecting something to happen, and I’d only looked to do 1 other interview because I was so sure I wanted to work for this company. Naturally, I have a very emotional response to the rejection; “don’t tell me I’m awesome, but that you don’t have anything for me”…”make sure your interviewees get the godamn rejection letter, so they don’t feel like a dumbass when they email members of your company, asking what’s up”. And don’t forget the ugly, awkward feeling of having your friend get a job at the company you introduced him to and initiated contact with (feelings of “was I used? Did they ever give a shit about me?”).<p>Lesson learned I suppose. Nobody gives a shit about you, except YOU. What other lessons should I be taking from this? Don't introduce your friends to companies you want to work for until you have a job there first? LOL. Sigh, I don't even know what to think. In what world can you be complimented that heavily, and not even offered an internship. I can't even get a job offering to work for free.",1292238947

""We can't turn off our internet; we can't turn off our smartphones; we can't turn off our computers.""<p>How is this a loss of control? Using technology to make our lives easier or more enjoyable doesn't force you to relinquish control of your actions. If anything, it gives you greater control because you have more options and flexibility. For instance, GPS enabled phones allow me to walk or drive wherever I please without much thought, because it's so easy to get directions back.<p>Before my brother bought an android device, he was afraid that always having access to work email would be a big burden. What he found was the complete opposite; instead of being tied down to a computer, he now had the flexibility to move around, without being anxious about missing an important message.<p>In many ways, technology gives us more control of our lives, not less.<p>> ""You used to ask a smart person a question. Now, who do you ask? It starts with g-o, and it's not God,"" he quipped.<p>What if you don't have access to a smart person? What if this 'smart person' isn't smart? What if this smart person is manipulative? With the internet, the collective knowledge of millions of people are a mouse click away, and it's nearly impossible for any one person to control this information. How on Earth is this something to be afraid of?<p>He then decides to complain about Slingbox. He claims that because it has bugs, and because all software has bugs, all computers will fail. But all technology ever created by humans is faulty, so I'm not sure what's so significant about this. I'm betting Sling Box breaks less than a record player.<p>There's nothing insightful about this. He's just rambling about how the times are changing, without citing anything substantial.",1292238832

Password hashes are meant to be one-way and chosen specifically so that getting plaintext (readable string) from the ciphertext (hashed gibberish) is very hard. When you create an account, the plain text for your password is hashed and stored. When you want to subsequently login, the system only needs to use the exact same hashing steps and see if they produce an identical hash to the one stored.<p>Things are done this way specifically so that if a compromise such as the one at gawker happens, it is harder for the attacker to get people's actual passwords.<p>This is the primary difference between encryption, where you want to be able to recover the plaintext and hashing, where you want to make it very hard to recover the plaintext.",1292238426

But the TL/DR is that Penrose believes there's something quasi-magical about thinking that can't be done with Turing machines, and therefore needs all kinds of special physics to get going.  It' just so patently naive and absurd to a working computer scientist that it makes me suspect his ego/judgment ratio is a bit high.",1292238312

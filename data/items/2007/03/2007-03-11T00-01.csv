From my limited experience, talking about your ideas to both laypeople and technical people can only help you.<p>Talking to laypeople helps you solidify and lets you practice pitching what it is that you're doing.  When you're working at a company, you don't have to explain yourself very much.  But when you say you're doing a startup, I've found that most people will demand more of an explanation.  However, most people don't have the patience in everyday settings to listen to more than 2 or 3 minutes of it.  This helps you whittle out the core of what it is that you're trying to build.  Call it a functional spec cleaning, if you want.<p>Talking about your ideas with technical people might give you insight into different areas you're not as familiar with.  The more that I read, the more I realized everything is inter-related.  But it's hard to have that kind of breadth in this day and age of specialization--there's just way too much to know.  Talking to technical people will often times help you make connections and leads to other technical fields that will help you get a feel for where else you can dig or if you're digging in the right place.<p>That said, most people won't steal your ideas for the same reasons mentioned before by others.  Doubts and eagerness to point out how it might not work.  Lack of vision, breadth and depth to understand the problem and implications.  Lack of technical ability.  Lack of time.  Lack of motivation.<p>And after reading and talking to people, it seems like ideas end up changing.  It's only when you're a bit bigger that you'd have to worry about secrets.",1173573463

3484,comment,3171,3258,0,0,akkartik,,,"More important than being able to talk to each other is being able to see who's talking to one, I think.<p>a) Notification when someone replies directly to one's comment.<p>b) Some way to easily find new comments on a thread. Instead of marking comments read, let me click a page-level button to ""reset new marks"". Couple that with sorting the front-page by 'number of recent comments'. Especially in periods when the front-page changes infrequently it'll allow users to follow discussions after they've read the submission.<p>Let me find interesting users and filter them for potential co-founders.<p>c) Show me users whose submissions and comments I upmod most and who I talk to the most.<p>d) Provide tags for me to add on my profile: location, horizon to startup, areas of interest, etc. Allow others to set constraints and highlight for them users who match those constraints/tags.",1173572899

3482,comment,3264,3439,0,0,dfranke,,,"That's a surprisingly low number, actually.  The first SFP had 227 applications[1] and I assume it's grown since then.  Based on nothing at all, I'll guess that the average application has 2.35 founders, so that's 533 applicants.  YC has been pretty explicit that they want applicants to participate here.<p>[1] http://web.archive.org/web/20050414040411/ycombinator.com/sfpannounce.html",1173572379
3481,comment,363,363,0,0,domp,,,"I have no idea if this has already been brought up (considering I just skimmed over the responses in this discussion) but I'd like to see another tab on top that maybe is for questions that people are curious about. I see that people are posting in the news areas not links but a single question that they're looking for people to respond to and create debate. They're not necessarily news worthy contributions but important none the less in fueling conversations.

The problem with TTL is that you need know your change is coming in advance.<p>Eg: If your domain's TTL is currently 24 hours, you need to change it to something much shorter (say 5 minutes) at least 24 hours before the DNS change happens, as this will mean that every DNS server will know to update its record for your domain every 5 minutes before you actually make a DNS change.<p>The other problem is to 'improve' response times, some DNS servers (particularly ISPs) don't honour the TTL directive.",1360406722

They see adding the code that will produce the duplication as bad / waste.<p>Don't do that.<p>It's hard - because the code that they've not typed or copy/pasted doesn't exist or work yet. It's still in their head.<p>Make the duplication explicit first.<p>Type it out. Copy and paste.

I agree with asking questions about their business and strategy because such questions can lead to interesting conversations, but to outright refuse to do someone's project because <i>you</i> don't think it'll work is the epitome of arrogance.<p>Lots of people want BS projects and lots of people also only really learn through experience. That $10k project that is ""obviously doomed to fail"" might give them a fairly cheap education in business that will lead them to their next, more profitable project. Or, perhaps, they'll figure out they're not getting the results they want, ask why, and make the necessary changes to make it work with that $10k thing that's been built. Not everybody is irrational or unreasonable in the face of failure. (Also, that BS project might actually succeed too.)<p>Bear in mind that most businesses fail, and someone's first and second businesses are even more likely to fail. Trying to save someone from failing in this way is depriving them of the experience that they need to be successful later. It's akin to trying to stop a toddler from falling but also preventing them from learning to walk. Experience is a valuable teacher and we don't need to be out trying to save the world from failure. Failure is necessary.<p>One more example: if I go to my hair stylist and ask for it all to be shaved off, I'd hope that he'd tell me I wouldn't look good with a buzz cut.

5192255,comment,5189141,5189141,1,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I expect most of us would agree that a single function should ideally have exactly one main job and do it well.<p>Two functions are really doing the same job, and should probably therefore be combined into a single function, not when their behaviour <i>is</i> the same but when it <i>should always be</i> the same. As the article suggests, that determination is generally more about the software design or domain model than the mechanics of the current implementations.<p>Having said that, there is also a middle ground: create some sort of utility/helper function(s) to contain the code that <i>is</i> the same, coincidentally or otherwise, and then rewrite the two higher-level functions in terms of common helpers for now. If those higher-level functions need to diverge for good reasons later, at least it will be an active decision to separate the behaviours.<p>IME that sort of breakdown is unlikely to be beneficial with very short functions such as the examples here. Theres not enough commonality to justify the overheads of breaking everything up. However, in more realistic code, if youve got, say, 80% common operations between multiple cases, there are often some underlying concepts that can be extracted into their own functions. Those then become informatively named building blocks for the original functions.<p>Put another way, you might not want to consolidate the functions <i>interfaces</i> if they serve logically distinct purposes, but you can still consolidate some of their <i>implementation</i> details.",1360405277

Sometimes you merge things or re-introduce duplication to get someplace better.<p>When you look at refactoring examples online, they often make that mistake.  There's a straight arrow toward a ""better solution"" but without any backtracking.  It's a hobbled view of refactoring.<p>To bring it home, in the blog example, I think is perfectly fine to remove duplication in the way listed as ""bad"", as long as you reintroduce the duplication when you have a bit of trouble. Much of the time, you're lucky and you don't.",1360404327

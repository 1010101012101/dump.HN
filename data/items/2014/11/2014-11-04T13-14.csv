Since it is not part of the standard physics curriculum, many physicists—probably the majority—are simply unfamiliar with the theory and how it works. <i>Sometimes the theory is rejected without explicit discussion of reasons for rejection. One also finds objections that are based on simple misunderstandings;</i> among these are claims that some no-go theorem, such as von Neumann&#x27;s theorem, the Kochen-Specker theorem, or Bell&#x27;s theorem, shows that the theory cannot work. Such objections will not be dealt with here, as the reply to them will be obvious to those who understand the theory.

Basically, you sometimes have multiple options for how to distribute letters over blocks when writing down a word, and the ortography then fairly consistently prefers the variants that keep the same morpheme spelled consistently across different words. It promotes morpheme reuse and makes the writing more LEGO-like.<p>Purely phonemic spelling is sort of overrated.

For a vector, you might additionally encode whether its growth should be linear or exponential, what its minimum and maximum sizes should be, and various growth factors.<p>Violating a role would not be an error, though it might be slow, and in debug mode you might get a diagnostic message to help you adjust the roles in your program.<p>Some role-like features are already present in languages, libraries, and hardware, such as “restrict” to encode the expectation of non-aliased buffers, “__builtin_expect” to encode likelihood, and “__builtin_prefetch” to encode the intent to access a value soon.",1415107753

Probably, someone out there has a pathological example where md5 is somehow actually slower than sha1.<p>MD5 is almost too good of a hash function for mere de-duping, but I have to use it because its near universal.

On the AS/400 thankfully thats not my area of responsibility but I know its compatible with all of the above.  In perl its &quot;use Digest::MD5&quot;.  The most important part is a md5 calculated on an engineering data record will always be the same hash result number no matter the source, which is very important for de-duping.<p>The world of programmers has some very peculiar ideas about hashes such that there is usually only one library for hashing and it often only has stuff like md5 or sha1 which is not good enough for crypto and overkill for de-duping and ID creation.

A basic income of 5% of median personal or household income is going to be little more than a sick joke.  Note I didn&#x27;t say &quot;exactly the same as&quot; but rather &quot;a substantial fraction&quot;<p>To compare people who make millions of dollars a year to people who are eking out subsistence wages is a mistake I think.  These people tend to be highly motivated and thus for them it&#x27;s often not strictly about the money anyhow, but the money sure is nice as it affords them the ability to work on the thing they&#x27;re passionate about.  When you&#x27;re making $9/hr at mcdonalds I suspect that passion has less to do with it and a need to eat and have shelter is a bigger factor.<p>The higher taxes go, the more incentive there is to work under the table.  I don&#x27;t know if the black market in the US is bigger than in Europe, but I can tell you that in the US taxes are lower and so there&#x27;s less incentive.  I agree that policing can do a fair amount, but what if you push people into entirely invisible jobs?  It doesn&#x27;t have to change MOST of the labor market, but if right now the black market is 10% of GDP and the taxes rise enough to push it to 15% or 20% then you&#x27;re growing crime.  I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a good outcome.<p>Now a great question to ask is which is worse?  Would it be worse to raise crime and have a basic income?  I don&#x27;t know.

8556284,comment,8543866,8555823,0,0,capnrefsmmat,,,"Another way of putting the argument is that, if the base rate of publication bias is low, your articles will have a very high false discovery rate. That&#x27;s inevitable, yes, but it means I would not treat your individual bias results as particularly strong.<p>But the survey of <i>Psychological Science</i> papers makes this point moot, since it shows that the base rate is fairly high.<p>It would be interesting to see if there are other approaches to detecting publication bias. In medicine several reviews have spotted outcome reporting bias by comparing clinical trial protocols given to ethics committees with the published papers. Typically the clinical trial protocol includes several outcomes that aren&#x27;t in the paper. Other reviews search clinical trial registries to find publication bias.<p>Is there something analogous in psychology? You could presumably track down ethics board documents and figure out what fraction of experiments never appear, then do a sensitivity analysis on the published results. I don&#x27;t know if this has been done.<p>I assume you&#x27;re familiar with this survey that found about 50% of psychologists admit to publication bias: John, L. K., Loewenstein, G., & Prelec, D.

There are still 32 bit machines and it is not unlikely to have a contiguous 4 meg region of heap unavailable in a long lived app. (One option to help is to ensure that the naive object duplication code always compact the new copy.   But malloc can (and will) fail.)",1415106242

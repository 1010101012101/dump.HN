There is no evidence he ever collected the data he used to spread that myth.<p>On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, Dave Grossman<p>Quote From Wikipedia<p>The book is based on SLA Marshall&#x27;s studies from World War II, which proposed that contrary to popular perception,[1] the majority of soldiers in war do not ever fire their weapons and that this is due to an innate resistance to killing. Based on Marshall&#x27;s studies the military instituted training measures to break down this resistance and successfully raised soldiers&#x27; firing rates to over ninety percent during the war in Vietnam.[2]<p>Below quote from\n<a href=""http://www.warchronicle.com/us/combat_historians_wwii/marshallfire.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.warchronicle.com/us/combat_historians_wwii/marsha...</a><p>Emphasis not in original<p>This calculation assumes, however, that of all the questions Marshall might ask the soldiers of a rifle company during his interviews, he would unfailingly want to know who had fired his weapon and who had not. Such a question, posed interview after interview, would have signalled that Marshall was on a particular line of inquiry, and that regardless of the other information Marshall might discover, he was devoted to investigating this facet of combat performance. John Westover, usually in attendance during Marshall&#x27;s sessions with the troops, does not recall Marshall&#x27;s ever asking this question. Nor does Westover recall Marshall ever talking about ratios of weapons usage in their many private conversations. <i>Marshall&#x27;s own personal correspondence leaves no hint that he was ever collecting statistics. His surviving field notebooks show no signs of statistical compilations that would have been necessary to deduce a ratio as precise as Marshall reported later in Men Against Fire.  The &quot;systematic collection of data&quot; that made Marshall&#x27;s ratio of fire so authoritative appears to have been an invention.</i>",1441429019

The problem here is the order of the size of the penalties, not the penalty itself.<p>Increasing the penalty for the behavior the government created an incentive to engage in is completely backwards.  When the source of the trouble is that the driver is stuck between a rock and a hard place, you don&#x27;t improve the situation by making the hard place harder. It provides the even more perverse incentive to not only kill the victim but also any witnesses, or do other bad things in order to avoid getting caught.<p>Look at the root cause. You have an unexpected liability that is so large it makes the person desperate.<p>What you need then is mandatory insurance. Take the ruinous liability away and the motivation for killing the victim disappears.",1441428883

10173985,comment,10171792,10173860,0,0,PhasmaFelis,,,"Dungeons in games have to do two things: serve as spaces of play, and provide verisimilitude, suspension of disbelief. Most often, the first takes high priority, and the second shows up only as set dressing: cells in a prison, waterways in a sewer, altars in a temple, etc.<p>If you look at classic tabletop dungeons, though--the games that gave us the modern meaning of &quot;dungeon&quot; as &quot;enclosed space full of loot and danger&quot; as opposed to the dictionary &quot;underground prison&quot;--you&#x27;re more likely to see a balance between the two. Everything still serves the needs of play, but within that framework you&#x27;ll find bunkrooms, kitchens, storage rooms, training areas, etc, etc, sometimes even with discussion of schedules and which characters are likely to be where when, which the players can attempt to learn and take advantage of. It&#x27;s more work, but it does make the gameworld feel more immersive, more real.<p>Either approach is perfectly valid. In a fast-paced hack-and-slash game, you&#x27;re not likely to stand still long enough to notice the set dressing; you just need a space in which to kill monsters, and anything more is a waste. In a more thoughtful/exploratory RPG, the game can really benefit from a thoughtful layout.<p>Now isn&#x27;t it nice when we can disagree without getting all huffy and belligerent?",1441428622

With a forward-secret backdoor, if a reverse­-engineer breaches the key-generator, then the previously stolen information remains confidential.<p>If the key-generator embeds a secret key (for seed exfiltration), the backdoor design will never be robust against reverse engineering.

The reverse, obviously, is not true.<p>In all cases, you may be sued civilly for a wrongful death, battery, or any number of other things. And lots of parties can bring the suit: the individual himself, various members of his family, your homeowners association, etc. N is fairly big, removing one of the N probably is not meaningful. Do these sort of civil suits tend to pay more for woundings than deaths?

The usual stuff I suppose.<p>After dealing with these on a daily basis for a year, I added suicidal ideation to the list. Death no longer seemed scary, but a way to escape the nonstop overwhelming pain of continued existence.<p>On the plus side, after entering treatment, and then understanding and overcoming my mental illness, I am without question far, far stronger than I was before. I live every day to the fullest and have no regrets. My life is full of what&#x27;s important to me- satisfying work, nonstop learning, appreciating art in various forms, and socializing with friends and family. This is what gives me pleasure and defines my life. I also have enormous appreciation for being healthy in a way that my peers seem to lack.

I simply want to pay for them and let others who&#x27;s business it is to focus on making better tools create them for me.  My job isn&#x27;t to become an expert on a code editor&#x27;s source code or our FEA tool&#x27;s code base.  My job is to use these tools and others to develop the products our clients want us to develop.<p>So, yeah, I will gladly pay --and we do pay tens of thousands of dollars per year-- for the right tools, with the right performance, the right support and the right feature set.  If we need something special and it can be done with some easy scripting, sure, absolutely.  Otherwise I prefer to communicate needs to our vendors and hope they see the need to address these pain points.<p>We&#x27;ve had at least half a dozen cases of software providers sending members of their development team to our office to spend time learning about issues we found and how to fix them.  One of them was a team of software developers from India that made the trip to try and figure out why their CAM software was crashing end-mills on our Haas vertical machining centers and churning aluminum like it was butter with the 20 HP spindles.<p>Our mission was to make parts.  We made that happen one way or the other.  It took them --while being fully versed in their own code-base-- a week to find the problem and another month to fix it and go through regression testing.  It probably would have taken us three to six months to do the same thing (had it been open source) while completely deviating from our core mission.<p>On another occasion we devoted three months to write this application that automated component creation for an EDA tool we were using.  The tool had shortcomings.  Thankfully it had an API that, of all things, could be accessed through Visual Basic.  We talked about it and decided to fix it by creating an external tool in VB.<p>It took one engineer three months of total dedication to the cause to write the code and produce a working tool.  And it was great.  What used to take three hours could now be done in 30 minutes.<p>That seemed like an example of resources and time well used.  Except, as the EDA tool company issued updates our tool would break and we very quickly found ourselves chasing our tails constantly fixing our code.  It was the old &quot;when you are up to your ass in alligators&quot; story.<p>Six months later we decided it was a far better to jettison the EDA tool and buy a better tool instead.  That was the right decision.  We should have made that decision nine months earlier rather than completely deviate from our core business to fix someone else&#x27;s problems.<p>I have more stories like that one.  I am not saying what I say to be difficult, I have the scars to prove which business and engineering decisions are right and wrong, not in absolute terms, of course, but in the context of the task at hand.",1441426762

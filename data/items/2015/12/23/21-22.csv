Most people are not adept at negotiating for anything.  So, yes, conceptually, they are a good idea and they should not go away.  I never proposed that they disappear.<p>The problem is that American unions succeeded at entering into a destructive feedback loop where union management had to justify their existence (and huge salaries) by always grabbing more and more for the membership.  Even to the point of the ridiculous examples I laid out from the automotive industry.<p>This seems to be a common failure in both government and organizations such as unions:  Past a certain point it is nearly impossible for management to go to their members and say something like &quot;We need to stop asking for more on pensions, salaries and benefits because we are going to cause damage to the future viability of this company&quot;.<p>Why?  Because of pandering or populism.  There&#x27;s always a sick would-be leader who will step in and counter that with gifts-a-plenty while vilifying the guy who proposed moderation or, the unthinkable, cut-backs and concessions in order to ensure things remain viable for the greater good.<p>That&#x27;s the mechanism that has turned a lot of unions (not all) in to agents of destruction rather than responsible participants in an ecosystem.  Union members are NOT bad people.  They, like anyone else, would like to live better, earn more and retire well.  They trust and follow the people they hire to represent them, the union leaders.  This leadership, high on power and, yes, in cooperation with incompetent company executives ultimately fails their membership by creating situations where the company&#x27;s own survival becomes mathematically impossible.<p>You know, what&#x27;s interesting about this is that down-votes fail at masking reality.  We have an entire city, if not a state, to serve as evidence for the sheer destruction caused by the combination of bad union leadership when combined with incompetent corporate management.  Had these companies not been bailed out to the tune of billions of dollars Detroit would have cratered under the weight of an utterly unsustainable equation.",1450906358

Profit is a function of value created but also your ability to control and monetize the delivery of value to customers. Software is a great example. Creating a shrink-wrapped software product creates a lot of value, but it&#x27;s almost impossible to monetize shrink-wrapped software these days. That&#x27;s why everything is moving to SaaS--it&#x27;s much easier to monetize.<p>The way the consumer electronics market is currently structured, what drives your ability to monetize created value is strong, vertically-integrated manufacturing capability. That&#x27;s what Apple&#x27;s and Samsung&#x27;s profits are built on. Creating technology delivers value, but you can only monetize it to the extent you can build and deliver Chinese-made products into the hands of consumers at high efficiency.<p>A great example of this is Apple buying P.A. Semi. A7-A9 have created tremendous value for consumers. But Apple purchased P.A. Semi for a pittance. The value-creation potential in P.A.

Right now it reads like only women involved in Gender Studies pay more for stuff.<p>The article is pretty interesting.  There are a few stark contrasts where you see the exact same item costing twice as much in pink than red.<p>I think there is an interesting philosophical debate to be had here (which the article implies, but doesn&#x27;t address): Is this gender-based price discrimination?  I&#x27;m going to contend: no.<p>First of all, I think the article falls into some kind of Political Correctness trap by claiming that certain products are for boys and others are for girls.  Why couldn&#x27;t a boy want the pink scooter?  Why couldn&#x27;t a girl want red?<p>Building on that, if we see the pink one as &quot;girls&quot; and the red one as &quot;boys&quot; then it does look like discrimination.  However, if we view the red one as &quot;neutral/base color&quot; and the pink one as a less popular &quot;color option&quot; it seems less like discrimination and more like paying for a unique customization.  Do we know there isn&#x27;t a blue scooter priced the same as pink?<p>Let&#x27;s look at the jeans.  Are the Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s jeans actually the same?  Probably not.  I&#x27;m guessing the women&#x27;s jeans are cut much differently.  When I was in Boy Scouts I (male, with typical male proportions) bought the &quot;Adult Womens&#x27;&quot; uniform because it was cut different and fit me better.  I didn&#x27;t actually notice the price because that was back in the glory days of my parents buying me stuff, but I would have chosen the &quot;womens&#x27;&quot; uniform even if it were twice the price.<p>The conclusion states:<p>> DCA found, on average, that women pay approximately 7 percent more than men for similar products.  Products’ price differences based on gender are largely inescapable for female consumers simply due to the product offerings available in the market.<p>This seems fundamentally contradictory to me.  If the products are sufficiently similar but priced differently, why would women buy the &quot;women&#x27;s version?&quot;  What makes it &quot;inescapable?&quot;  If product A is so much better than product B, such that buying Product A is &quot;inescapable,&quot; I&#x27;d expect a difference of more than 7% in price.",1450904613

My gf buys solid branded 30 euro pants, mine start at 40 and are shitty, solid branded pants start at 70-80, for example. The difference is pretty huge. Buying decent formal wear for work is much more expensive for men, both the shoes and the suit I feel. For some decent leather shoes I&#x27;m spending upwards of 150 euros, gf walks around in stylish 30 euro leather short heels that are fine quality, 80 euros would be considered expensive but long lasting for her.<p>I know it&#x27;s anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve talked about this with friends quite often and they all say it. And men&#x27;s floors are usually singular, too, the other 2-3 floors are all for women, with one especially for girls. The competition for women&#x27;s clothing is so strong it&#x27;s pushing prices down. Thought it&#x27;d be no different in the US. Not just shops either, second hand markets for girls are insane, you&#x27;ll easily buy pants for 2 euros at the ijhallen (popular fleamarket in Amsterdam, mostly for girls age 19-26 or so) that cost 30 euros in the shop a year ago, and have the same quality as a guys&#x27; 80 euro pants haha. It&#x27;s crazy.<p>Then there&#x27;s the laundry, I&#x27;ve never heard of that before either, nor seen it. Different prices for hairdressers though is very common here though, in fact certain gender-only hairdressers are pretty much the majority. All the other stuff like razors, a more expensive &#x27;female version&#x27; of a toy etc is really familiar, too.0",1450904585

They&#x27;re not identical products, there&#x27;s economies of scale at work, etc, however, I believe there&#x27;s a few places that marketing has specifically been targeted at women for products that such targeting is not happening (at least not successfully/to the scale of) for men: Shampoo, Conditioners, and Soap.  Most men don&#x27;t care enough about these things (outside of shaving needs, which have outrageous products similarly targeting men), but enough women do care enough for them to be victims of marketing and wasted money.<p>These products principal feature <i>is</i> the advertising.  &quot;Natural&quot; and &quot;Essential Oils&quot; and other common &quot;features&quot; mean exactly nothing (or not at all what folks <i>think</i> they mean).  And many use pricing for the explicit purpose of implying quality.  Obviously a $90 shampoo beats a $5 store brand.<p>I <i>freaked out</i> when I found out a shampoo my wife loved was $40!  So on one of my shopping adventures, I purchased several different brands of conditioner, shampoo and body wash (up to $30.00 w/coupon and no ingredients she was sensitive to), and generic 1 oz. travel bottles.  I filled each and we switched them weekly for a few months.  Her $40.00 one was in the middle of the rotation and made it &quot;one shower&quot; -- she hated it[1].  In each case the pick was in the bottom 25% for price.  Body Wash: Axe for Men O_o, Shampoo: Kirkland (Costco), Conditioner: a Suave product (Suave was a back-up in all three, consequently -- I buy all at once when coupons/store discounts match up, so we needed a few).<p>[1] I have never told her that was &quot;her brand&quot; -- she would have taken that as me calling her dumb/gullible when the reality is that these companies spend large sums of money to specifically target her -- and there&#x27;s just no good reason to be a dick.",1450904413

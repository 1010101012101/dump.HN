3722899,comment,3720332,3721276,2,0,bane,,,"My father grew up in a very rural, very uneducated part of the U.S. and had a deep ""southern"" accent (though ""country"" or ""rural"" is probably more apt). When he was 16 or so he ran away from home and landed in Chicago where his accent immediately marked him as a country bumpkin. This made him tremendously shy in the city and he spent most of his time in isolation.<p>He spent years retraining his accent, reading Webster's, practicing day in and day out. To this day he can't even successfully fake the accent of his youth. My best guess as to what he sounded like comes from his brothers, all of whom have a rich rural accent to this day.<p>As part of his effort to get over his shyness and his accent, he joined several public speaking clubs. While they helped with his accent and his shyness, they also taught him a great deal about hesitation noises and he's passed on two things to me (which of course I didn't truly appreciate until years later when I had to get out and start talking in front of groups).<p>1) Hesitation noises are usually just a way for our brain to catch up with our mouth, interestingly and helpfully, it's also a way for an audience's brain to catch up with their ears.<p>2) It's funny becoming aware of them, it's like suddenly becoming aware of breathing, it's very automatic, and when you start to think about it, the first thing you do is take a deep breath. The same with ums and ahhs, once you are aware of them, the first thing you should do is take a deep breath instead of saying them.<p>The audience will be glad for the pause, they'll have time to absorb the complex thought that you are in the process of putting together anyways. And you'll have time to put it together.<p>If the deep breaths aren't your thing he also recommended I turn my ""ums"" into ""mmms"" and then the next step is to turn the voiced ""mmms"" into a silent outbreath through my nose with my lips in the ""mmm"" position. It doesn't make a distracting noise and the effect is a thoughtful pause.",1332143752

I am incredibly fond of it and it has replaced Django for most things I do in web dev. I am very familiar with it and its limitations/ugly corners. Familiarity breeding contempt and all that. That said, little contempt has arisen from my familiarity with Flask. It's that good.<p>Do we upvote these blog posts because we think they're constructive? This is somewhere on the order of a press release in depth. The farthest this post gets is in describing an app that uses hard-coded credentials to log an administrator in.<p>This doesn't demonstrate the strengths of Flask, nor the weaknesses, nor why it's necessarily better than Sinatra, Bottle, or any other micro web-framework.<p>Since this post has failed to do so, I'll fill in that gap as quickly as I can.<p>Flask is great because it <i>scales</i> to your needs. It starts as painlessly as any other micro web-framework, but what makes it nice is that it's so <i>easy</i> and <i>clean</i> to graft disparate ways of doing a web-app.<p>In my particular case, I'm in the process of building a service on Flask and MongoDB. I'm in the process of making Flask, WTForms, and MongoEngine all play nice together and Flask has done a wonderful job of making this painless because it doesn't make any bizarre assumptions and it doesn't force any strange contortions in my code like Sinatra or raw Rack apps do.<p>Having hacked on some Rack and Sinatra code, I can tell you right now that the moment you want to make a ""real"" app with the typical complexity of a mature service, even the bare basics get <i>painful</i> really fast.<p>Flask hasn't done this to me yet, it's already breezed well past where I've taken raw Rack and Sinatra+Rack apps before.<p>This blog post, however, does not come from experience. It does not attempt to explain why Flask is better than the alternatives, it doesn't even demonstrate any interesting aspects of Flask.<p>This is blogspam.<p>Please reconsider your upvotes, please reconsider promoting content like this again.<p>Popularity for popularity's sake in the absence of knowledge, experience, and data is simply ""pop culture"". (cf. Node.js)<p>Edit: Worse, the author even explicitly appeals to the quality of Flask on the basis of ""branding"".<p>Engineering decisions shouldn't be made on the basis of pop culture.<p>Choose Flask because you know it suits the problem you're solving well, or because you know it suits your style of programming.<p>Don't choose it because somebody showed you a ""hello, world!"" example.",1332143220

To that end, nothing in this blog post is specific about why you [the author] feel it's necessary to discourage leveling the gender ratios in our field. I understand that [male] engineers more often than not make disparaging remarks, talk non-stop about the latest (or sometimes the oldest) technology, and are overwhelmingly socially inept, but this is not a reason to stop trying to get more women into STEM. In fact, I strongly believe in the contrary: having more women in the tech industry will greatly improve working environments, reduce the social awkwardness about being a woman in this field, and make the field that much more interesting.<p>In the end, my take away from this post is exactly opposite from the purported thesis. The author's experience leads me to believe that we should absolutely be encouraging young girls to enter tech. Yes, it might be painful and lonely now, but if you start scaring girls instead of encouraging them, nothing will ever get better.<p>We're engineers; our jobs revolve around building efficient systems by finding the weak points and fixing them.

However, in Go, you still have no choice but to allocate on the heap in many instances (for example, when returning a data structure from a function, or when using maps, etc.) You're taking a big bet that programs will be able to use the stack and manually use free lists or whatever (which you can still do in Java!), and that the slow performance of the GC won't be a problem. I wouldn't take that bet.<p>Besides, once you have a stop-the-world multithreaded GC, it has to trace all the roots in the program for correctness. There's no way around that. At that point having all the data on the stack doesn't help you (except for cache locality, but Java's GC already does that via the nursery and copying during major collections). You must still trace every pointer in the object graph, while keeping all threads suspended. You can run the GC less often, but that's not much of a help when interactive performance is at stake. iOS feels so great because the UI is <i>always</i> running at 60 frames per second.

In most cases relational databases is the best option for what they are doing, but I think there are many situations where people choose the old sql just because they don't know better. So, although there might be a point in comparing and competing between different NoSQL technologies, I think all within the NoSQL movement can gain from better marketing to all these relational database users.<p>Anyway, I think what you are saying is I need to be very good at describing why my technology is better than others, which as a developer I find very difficult. It is easy to be technical about it, but how to describe something at a level that makes sense to the average guy is something I am still trying to learn.<p>What my solution does very well is integration with object oriented languages and where the data is described by complex inheritance structures and ownership relations (say a financial model with different types of financial instruments, different types of market data, static data, deal data, etc which would be described by a number of class hierarchies; and all linked together).<p>With the risk of getting too technical, if you are building a C++ application for example, you only create your C++ classes (with any inheritance structure which can be single/multiple etc), and you can use pointers to other objects (polymorphic pointers and cyclic graphs are ok), use standard collection classes etc. Basically what you would normally do when designing a C++ application. You use a minimum amount of declarative code as C++ doesn't have built-in reflection. You send your C++ classes to the database and receive the data as your C++ classes. It traverses your objects to find all linkages to other objects prior to sending and links objects together upon retrieval. In short, the solution tries to make life as easy as possible for an application programmer.<p>What my solution does in terms of CAP and ACID:
Atomicity - A transaction is either committed in full or not at all. A transaction may consist of one or multiple objects.<p>Consistency - No consistency checks in the sense that there are defined constraints on the member fields. However, all objects are versioned, and if two clients are trying to commit the same version of an object, the second client will fail and it would have to retrieve the most recent version before updating the object.<p>Isolation - All transactions are processed in isolation, i.e. all objects in a transaction are locked prior to being updated<p>Durability - Transactions are never overwritten, i.e. new transactions are always added to the end of the data store. If a transaction has completed successfully, you can be certain that the transaction will be completed even after a server crash.<p>Availability - Concurrency is handled by locking objects. Many clients can read simultaneously, but if you try to read an object that is locked for writing by someone else, you will have to wait (there is room for improvement here). If you try to write to an object that someone else is writing to, you will fail. I have not looked into performance of a large number of clients, however the simple answer is that consistency is prioritised above availability.<p>Partition Tolerance - None at the moment. I have not looked into distributing the database yet.",1332141468

In my mind, I compare this to the stigmatization of nuclear power. The combination of the public's lack of trust in science, along with the media's ceaseless quest for sensational (and often fear-based) stories has led to an overly-cautious approach to spaceflight (IMO). This has severely impacted our progress in space exploration; 43 years after the moon landing, we have no active human exploration programs outside the ISS. Embarrassing.<p>I'm all for improving flight safety and avoiding needless loss of life, but I also believe in taking risks to achieve important goals. Space exploration is worth the risk.<p>For commercial satellite launches, I see relatively little impact. Existing launch vehicles do not have a 100% success track record, and customers will cover the loss with insurance.<p>The biggest concern is with manned flights. I'm not really qualified to predict the outcome, but I really hope that pragmatism will prevail. As engineers, we do the best we can, but failures are inevitable. We simply do our best to learn from the failure and take those learnings back to the lab on the next iteration.",1332141324

I think the answer to both questions is related.<p>Armstrong and Cernan are just the Spam in the can. They're glorified pilots. As such, they are extensions of the PR arm of NASA and the entrenched aerospace industries. I've phrased that a little harshly, but not by much. Certainly, as trained monkeys go, they are marvelously trained. And not just any monkey could be trained to perform as they did in their, and I emphasize, highly specialized and limited roles within the space program. But, when we see a well-trained dog, the credit goes to the master.<p>If Armstrong and Cernan were rocket designers, if they had captained a startup that created a new launch vehicle, then I could take their statements seriously. If they were systems integrators, if they were manufacturing engineers, if they were anything other than good pilots, then they might have something useful to add to the discussion <i>on a national level</i>.  Until then, all I want to hear from them is how beautiful the Earth looks from space, how fun it is to play golf on the Moon, and various other fun facts about events that took place 40+ years ago.<p>I feel awful trying to cut these men down, trying to knock them back into place. However, the truly shameful thing is that they've used their legacy to usurp beyond their areas of expertise. I console myself that the bounds over which they've stepped are generous bounds, the bounds of heroes, and it takes a truly cataclysmic level of folly to behave as they have done.

Consider the rasterization software you're using right now in your web browser. Micro-optimizations <i>hugely</i> matter for blitting and tessellation. Consider video decoding (or encoding!). Using SSE instructions instead of going word-by-word or byte-by-byte makes an enormous difference. Read Dark Shikari's blog posts about x264 if you want to see how much good use of SSE matters for video encoding.<p>To name just one example: Modern x86 processors have an optimization that allows the fetch-and-decode step to be skipped for the second and subsequent iterations of small loops. By ""small"" I mean ""really really small"" -- something like 16 bytes is the number I've heard. By shaving a byte or two off the instruction encoding to fit a loop from 18 bytes into 16 bytes, the loop performance can double or triple. When that loop is the loop that drives alpha blending on your touch-sensitive mobile app, that can be the difference between an app that feels solid and fluid and an app that feels slow and pokey.<p>People use systems languages for performance. Folks for whom performance is irrelevant are all on dynamic languages, and that's not changing. Systems programmers need a compiler that knows about these micro-optimizations.",1332140478

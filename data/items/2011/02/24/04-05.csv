I'd want to make at least $100K, myself, but I'm softer than some.<p>Depending on where you'll be working in Manhattan, you may want to also consider Hoboken, New Jersey.  It's a walkable city and for the same amount of rent, the commute on the PATH train is often much shorter than the equivalent subway commute from the boroughs.  The PATH train's a fair bit nicer, too.<p>Don't live anywhere that feels sketchy in order to save on rent.  Not because it's unsafe - NYC is pretty safe these days - but because it's another source of stress when you're adjusting, especially if you're moving with a partner who doesn't have a job yet.  New city + iffy-feeling neighborhood + no job = hard on a relationship.<p>Wherever you live, you're likely to pay more money for less space and less amenities than you had before.  My advice: immediately start taking advantage of services like Fresh Direct and your local wash-and-fold.  Dragging laundry to the laundromat and shopping in tiny, crowded supermarkets can bring a lot of new arrivals down.  Especially, again, if these tasks are being done by a partner with no job yet.",1298523526

I see more and more of them in the hospital. I'm not certain whether this will lead to widespread adoption or is just a novelty. In our hospital you can use the iPad to first log into the hospitals Windows based network, then log into HMS, which only works with Internet Explorer. Given how tedious a process this is, and to perform order entry using this technique, to me doesn't seem like its going to last long. I'm thinking a 11"" MBA would come in more handy.<p>In the office, tablets should be used to review patient data, but the physician should probably not be entering any data - such as writing up the progress note or billing - while in the exam room. This takes away from the physician patient relationship. So to review data, tablets can be helpful, but are not exactly revolutionary. Real changes in how healthcare is delivered will be determined by how data is collected and how it is interpreted (like the Crimson Initiative).<p>Still, considering that EMR systems like AllScripts are charging over $600 a month PER physician (and that's at a ""special"" discounted rate for a few years), it's nice to see companies like DrChrono taking a stab at it, to see if they can offer something better, or equally compelling, for a cheaper price. A lot of existing EMR systems are bloated with features that most physicians will never use, and don't even really fully understand.",1298522909

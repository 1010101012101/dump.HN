People still pay money for mainframe computers, but only the people at the very top end of the market, given that a mainframe computer is feature rich and expensive.<p>Similarly, NYT is the most feature rich, extensive and wealthy masthead in the entire news world. People will continue paying for it in the same way that people pay for mainframe computers, but this doesn't mean they haven't been disrupted.

A hiring slip-up occurs, and it isn't fixed because of some conflict with other perks. An incompetent manager takes advantage of a results oriented work environment. A shitty hire lands on a team with a remote supervisor. Or some combination of both causes a rift that doesn't close, and good workers associated with the team have to bail.

I just feel like (in general, not you specifically) if you truly understand why you should do something, it isn't hard to motivate yourself to do it.<p>So, I think you should sit down and think about what you want to do with your life.  Consider all the options, narrow them down, educate yourself on things you're interested in but aren't familiar with, try things out.

E.g., last week there was a workout that I was 100% sure I won't be able to finish, though eventually I did even though it took me 20 mins more than more fit people, and I had to scale down couple of parts from prescribed. But thinking back about it, I constantly realize there's no way I'd push myself so hard if I weren't on Crossfit program. And that's probably why previous years of ""exercising"" here and there did very little for me, but with Crossfit I am feeling real progress. I am still very far from where I want to be, but at least I am feeling some movement towards the goal.

Further, diamonds aren't really fungible, so it's hard to compare pricing as you're really never going to buy the same diamond in two different contexts. That said, I'll provide the details of my own experience and let you decide whether Blue Nile's prices qualify as ""good"".<p>I got a ""perfect"" (D color, brilliant cut, flawless clarity) 0.5 carat diamond in a platinum band for about $4500 all inclusive. Looking at 3 brick and mortar stores, I did not find a single ring that compared in quality with what I bought from Blue Nile. Most retailers seem to cater towards larger diamonds, and I didn't want one of those - diamonds exhibit a serious iceberg effect, and a ""larger"" diamond doesn't always appear substantially larger when mounted in a ring. Based on what I did see, I expect a comparable ring from a brick and mortar store would be around double the cost and significantly harder to find. I did not check other online retailers.<p>Also, for what it's worth, I did not involve my wife in the ring-buying decision, favoring the element of surprise (I got her ring size by pretending to talk in my sleep for two months before the purchase and asking her nonsensical ?'s). Blue Nile's interface would be exceptional for involving a significant other, though - you can check pictures of an individual diamond as it would appear mounted in various rings, and I believe you could upload a photo of a hand to see how it would look when worn (I didn't do that - element of surprise and all). If it's not obvious enough from my posts so far, I'm a big fan of the company and would encourage anyone out there who's looking for a diamond to check Blue Nile.<p># EDIT - Noticed the caveat about pregnancy. Blue Nile will also resize their rings for free provided you ship it back to them.",1356592407

After more firewood was thrown on the fire, I decided to start looking, and at that point I had already decided not to accept any counter-offer.  Not only was I being shortchanged on salary (significantly), but also in benefits, perks, and working conditions.  I'm really happy I found an awesome startup in SF that still after a month feels like an ideal workplace for me.<p>When I was looking, I was disconcerted when I found companies with no personal growth prospects or that flat out said they wouldn't pay what I was asking (fair) because they didn't want to pay two engineers with the same title too differently.  I asked if they would offer bonuses to compensate or if they'd consider paying the other guy the same salary, because he seemed smart enough.  No to both, and I felt that alone indicated that management there didn't value engineering talent.<p>I really hope this treatment of talented workers isn't too pervasive in the industry.  Pay people what they're worth.  Strive to offer the best working conditions, benefits, and perks.  Take the values of your employees into consideration.  It really doesn't seem like it's too much to ask for.  And personally, I'm all for complete transparency within my company, even to the point of salary information.

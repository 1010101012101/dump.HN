However, no one was going to buy an iPhone for $900, and without this impressive supply chain, Apple wouldn't be able to get the profit margins they want at $600 ( or $200 subsidized, which is also supply chain management ).<p>Product is important, and as a culture that builds things, HNers tend to focus on that ( the green light conversation in these comments being proof of that ), but all the logistics of how a product is delivered are just as important as the product itself - and maybe more so - in building a successful company.",1320403592

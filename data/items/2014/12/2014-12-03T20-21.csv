8696306,comment,8694007,8694007,0,0,anateus,,,"Something at the core of a lot of the systemic problems with these &quot;sharing economy&quot;/&quot;p2p market&quot; companies is that they assume workers and sellers are fungible, and are thus in something approximating perfect competition[1]. Instead, much like the dating example in the article, they are actually a Matching Market[2]: there is some close-to-optimal arrangement of buyers to sellers. Long-term happiness with the services involves finding the best fit, rather than just the first sufficient fit.<p>The auction system of old TR allowed for discovery of these fits via the auction mechanism. I expect that much like a lot of other econ theory mechanisms in addition to the success stories in the article, it led to a lot of large scale usability friction. In the end, it looks like TR chose a smoother system with worse individual outcomes. The holy grail then is a system that elicits information about fit without leaking too much information and being easy to use at the same time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_competition</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://people.duke.edu/~aa88/articles/WorldCongressSurvey.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.duke.edu/~aa88/articles/WorldCongressSurvey.pd...</a>",1417640311

My mental model of the situation is that websites figure out which user is interacting with them via a &quot;session&quot; cookie, which is only set once the user successfully authenticates. The CSRF &quot;token&quot; is a value associated with this session (that may or may not change on every request) that&#x27;s included with all client-side requests as a way to guarantee that whoever is making the requests is doing so from the site&#x27;s pages. For instance, if I log in to Facebook, then in a new tab open up &#x27;somemalicioussite.com&#x27;, the malicious site might make force my browser to make a request to &#x27;facebook.com/some-private-api-endpoint&#x27; to try to figure out who I am. Because it doesn&#x27;t have the CSRF token, it fails.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard of using the CSRF token itself to answer the &quot;who is this user&quot; question.

8696289,comment,8694882,8695830,0,0,cpprototypes,,,"<i>The reason it sucks has more to do with the language and the culture that has grown up around it</i><p>I think the culture is a far bigger issue than the language.  Java is good when used properly, especially with the Java 8 updates.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to blame Java for the culture issues.  During the 90s and early 2000s, an &quot;enterprise&quot; culture formed using Java.  However, that culture used Java because it was the new, popular language at the time.  If Go or C# or Scala was released back then and had the same position as Java, that culture would&#x27;ve also produced very bad code in those languages.<p>Fortunately, the Java culture seems to be changing.  There is now a more noticeable division between the old style &quot;enterprise&quot; Java code and newer, modern, and simpler ways of using Java.<p>These days it&#x27;s important for a developer to know one static language and one dynamic language well.  And that doesn&#x27;t mean just knowing the syntax.  It also includes learning the idioms and best practices in those two languages.  The actual combination doesn&#x27;t matter.  It can be Java/JavaScript, C#/Ruby, C++/Python, Haskell/Closure, etc.  For example, I focus mostly on Java and JavaScript because I use one for server and the other for front end. My JS knowledge made it easy for me to understand the lambda addition in Java 8.  My Java knowledge allows me to understand the advantages of optional typing such as Typescript and Flow.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Java-only developers struggle with lambda in Java 8 because they&#x27;ve never written functional style code.  And I&#x27;ve seen JS-only developers fail to understand how optional typing could be helpful because they&#x27;ve never seen the power of static typing in IDEs.<p>I used to dabble in languages, but I don&#x27;t have time for that anymore.  I&#x27;ve found that focusing and keeping track of changes in Java and JS are enough for me.  JS is changing with ECMAScript 6 and includes good ideas from other dynamic languages such as Python.  I&#x27;m hoping that Java starts to get some of the best ideas from Haskell and Scala.",1417640125

Although you might be able to at least attempt learning a subject like physics or mechanical engineering in a vacuum (though I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d get very far), it&#x27;s simply not possible to grow in writing, rhetoric, or many of the humanities, without a dedicated dialogue between authors and evaluators.<p>That&#x27;s if your goal is to have an audience. Art was very successful in the West when Art was declared to exist for the sake of Art. It gave birth to a plethora of new techniques and artistic perspectives - many of which refined themselves in such a precise and beautiful way over time, that it almost seems to be a dance itself.<p>Regardless of whether you consider a painting of a square to be Art, or a musical composition of silence to be music, well... I think there are always new things to learn. It doesn&#x27;t always require constant criticism.

It also can do configuration management etc if you want, or a lot of people use it to just trigger existing chef/puppet jobs.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Saltstack in conjunction with Mesos to build out this full datacenter-as-OS stack. Works... :-)",1417639008

Every applicant gets 20 tickets. But in-district students get +2 tickets. Students with a sibling get +1 ticket. The raffle is still random but some people have slightly higher chance of winning.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s essentially administrator&#x27;s choice, is it not?</i><p>No, it is not. There is no administrator making any choice. There is an algorithm that sorts all the anonymous applicants into a list for each grade. Once the lists are set, they &quot;draw a line&quot; at the spot where that grade is full. Everyone below the line is now on the waiting list. In-district students get a slightly better score than out-of-district students. Compare and contrast, it is very difficult to attend a non-charter school that is not the one assigned by the district (based on your address). Probably impossible for out-of-district students. The fact that charter schools will even accept applications from outside the district means their enrollment is more open than non-charters. Siblings that live in the same house would automatically be going to the same non-charter school anyway. So allowing charters to do the same gives them no advantage. But even then, there is still no guarantee that you will get in even if your sibling is in. You just have a slightly better chance. What ever imbalance the charter school&#x27;s class size makes is negated by the fact that they get significantly less money per student than non-charters. That is part of the compromises that are written into the charter.",1417638835

Depending on the way you try to locate the mobile devices one advantage of Bluetooth can actually be its smaller range compared to a Wifi AP that&#x27;s running at its full range.<p>With regular consumer hardware it is basically impossible to use signal strength indication between an AP and a mobile device to do any kind of serious range estimation. Your best bet is therefore to use a whole grid of APs. The easiest way to locate devices is then to run all of them with a limited range and locate mobile devices based solely on proximity to a single AP. A more complex but potentially more accurate solution would be to run them with larger overlapping ranges and calculate the mobile device&#x27;s location based on the intersections. Running too many Bluetooth APs that actively broadcast for peers, however, may have the unintended side effect of jamming the 2.4 GHz band.<p>All in all, I actually agree that Wifi is the better solution nowadays. Symbian was the last smartphone OS that had Bluetooth set to visible by default. Since the switch to Windows all of the major smartphones will be invisible by default which was not the case in former years. Also, quite a few smartphone users will have Wifi enabled at all times which means their phones will actively broadcast for networks which makes them easy to track in a passive way using hardware that is already installed.",1417638646

8696076,comment,8693954,8695886,0,0,rayiner,,,"One is a tax on consumption, the other is a tax on income. One is applied to only the final sale, while the other applies at every sale in a production chain. One can never result in a company owing more tax than it makes in profit, the other can. Note that sales taxes that do apply at every step of the production chain (VAT taxes), have the same problem of computing net versus gross: the tax is applied to the difference in value between the outputs and inputs at each step.<p>Yes, one way to avoid the complexity of implementing a proper income tax is to tax something other than income. But there are reasons we tax income rather than consumption or property. Consumption taxes are regressive--poor people carry more of the overall tax burden. Property taxes have the undesirable characteristic that they often require you to pay money you don&#x27;t have in cash. Just because your house doubles in value doesn&#x27;t mean you have the cash to pay double the property taxes on it. Except in certain cases involving inheritance or gifts, income taxes don&#x27;t force you to sell property that increases in value just to pay the tax on it. Also, with property taxes you run into complexity in defining &quot;property.&quot; You&#x27;ll either draw arbitrary lines (land is property, but stock isn&#x27;t), and distort the economy as people invest more in untaxable property, or run into trouble valuating intangible property like stock ownership and IPR.<p>There&#x27;s a reason why every developed nation has settled on income taxes. The basic principle is something people can get behind. The existence of society and government helps you gain wealth, so it seems reasonable to people to tax a percentage of that gain in wealth. Moreover, people keep track of changes to wealth even without the tax regime (modern accounting predates the modern income tax by centuries), which makes income taxes relatively easier to administer.",1417637597

The silly date format (&quot;Thu, 25 November, 1921&quot;) is a relic from the <i>70s</i> and only there because that&#x27;s what someone happened to be doing on some private little mail system. And the IETF just blindly copies nonsense like that, even though there&#x27;s zero benefit to an English-specific long-date format in a protocol.<p>SIP headers, in the wild, cannot be unambiguously parsed. This is because the whole \r\n thing to end lines combined with the SIP RFC&#x27;s instructions that implementations should &quot;infer meaning&quot; ends up with some implementations considering \n\n to be start of data, and some not. Good luck.<p>Not to mention idiocy like &quot;comments in headers&quot;, &quot;line wrapping&quot;. Or my favourite &quot;put headers in the querystring&quot;. Because nothing makes ensuring your implementation is correctly following messaging (on which tons of money may ride) than specifying not only <i>two</i> ways to define a common header, but adding <i>two distinct locations</i> to find the same data.<p>Or the awesomeness of deciding &quot;IP fragmentation is broken&quot; (???) and deciding on an arbitrary MTU size at which point you&#x27;ve gotta flip to TCP. Literally, on a message-by-message basis, they see nothing wrong with requiring you to read from both a UDP and TCP socket to get the next message for a transaction. I&#x27;d go as far as saying they think they&#x27;re being clever. The only point of using UDP (complete with their own retransmission system to deal with packetloss) is if you think _maybe_ you&#x27;re gonna shave off 1xRTT by avoiding a TCP handshake. Except since most calls are going between well defined endpoints, that&#x27;s not an issue. And secure calling requires TCP (TLS) anyways. The real result is that plenty of implementations end up doing UDP only, or only really supporting UDP. And why MS decided this was idiotic, and went TCP only because &quot;most of our messages will exceed the MTU&quot;. Oh, and the kicker? IP fragmentation works fine. I analyzed a VoIP network (several terabytes of SIP signalling) and found about 1-2% of SIP messages were IP frag&#x27;d (MTU around 576) and never did IP frag mess anything up. All this crazy complexity because Rosenberg et al thought they were oh-so-clever about a non-existent problem.<p>The routing stuff is moronic, like IP&#x27;s source routing which the Internet decided was a terrible idea, but the IETF kept insisting on for IPv6 anyways.<p>I could go on, but this is direct result of writing SIP software and implementing SIP networks for around a decade.",1417636844

I don&#x27;t pretend that it was anything but a toy, though.<p>All that said, it seems that passing sensitive information in environment variables, squirreling them away in the process space somewhere, then cleaning the environment (all right away, during initialization) would be a smart thing to do.<p><i>edit: see `man 3 unsetenv` for how to do this</i><p>[0] <a href=""http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/pubs/snowberger-thesis.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/research/pubs/snowberger-thesis.pdf</a>",1417636800

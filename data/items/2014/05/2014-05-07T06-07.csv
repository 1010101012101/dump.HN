That&#x27;s tricky to get to organically, so you start doing things like paid marketing, and then realize that GoDaddy (et al) will <i>happily</i> spend $X0 to acquire $10 a year worth of domain business, both because it has a relatively high LTV and, more importantly, because it has a &quot;backend.&quot;  (e.g. GoDaddy made a $16 sale for me on bingocardcreator.com back in 2006 and then sold me another ~$5,000 of domains and SSLs over the years, and I don&#x27;t even use the products where they <i>really</i> make a killing, like hosted shopping carts and what have you.)<p>Relevantly to HNers: you&#x27;ll run into math like this for most software businesses.

We were collectively devastated,  some of my other online friends stopped playing for a week or two and things were not the same afterwards. Her daughter had the good sense to log on to the phone and tell us what had happened, we were kept from the truth until then.<p>I was deeply shocked by the turn of events, much like how, on the internet &#x27;nobody knows you are a dog&#x27;, nobody knows you are dying of c-word on some hospital ward. But we didn&#x27;t need to know that, in-game conversation was light hearted banter, no special treatment, which was good. From that hospital ward that lady had a good fifty to a hundred &#x27;in game&#x27; friends all around the world, we were there, outside of visiting hours, 24/7.<p>I think I was more shocked and with more grief layers to go through than I have experienced when some of my relatives have passed on.

But it can happen.<p>So, +1 to your original point. Games and apps or fancy shopping websites might seem trivial when there are so many problems in the world, however, through such things community can exist.

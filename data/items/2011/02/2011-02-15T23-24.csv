I really wanted to plunge into the book, but it's barely readable.  Here are the first two sentences of the second paragraph, a typical example of the book's style:<p>> It was at such a midnight hour that two men moved like gray shadows along the gravelly inner edge of a sickle-shaped gap between two low dunes, and the distance between them was exactly that prescribed by the Field Manual for such occasions. However, contrary to the rules, the one bearing the largest load was not the rear ‘main force’ private, but rather the ‘forward recon’ one, but there were good reasons for that.<p>It's probably brilliant in Russian, but an English speaker has to unravel and reconstruct each sentence. It makes for heavy going.<p>I say this not to negatively criticise, but simply to warn readers hoping to discover a fantastic interpretation of an epic tale.  A future translation, I am sure, will make for brilliant reading.",1297814377

Let them make complete technology choices, even if he says the application will be written in Erlang and Haskell. Give them input equal to yours when it comes to product direction, not ""I come up with all the ideas, you implement them"". Anything less, and they're an employee and not a founder.<p>That's very important: you will not get a top notch employees unless a) you have technical founders b) you can pay them above market rate and give a significant equity chunk c) challenge them in a way that grows their technical skill.<p>Take a look at a successful engineer at a top-notch Silicon Valley company: they have a job with brand name recognition, they do something they love (a _very_ important motivating factor for an engineer: they will not stop working on say garbage collection algorithms and start working on ""GroupON for X"" for a paycheck), they have a technical manager, they're earning above market rate (with performance based bonuses), they have stock which may not be a significant percentage but is 100% certain to be worth something.<p>The money you have isn't sufficient to pay an engineer a market rate salary. The problem you're solving is likely not very technical. The upside potential is likely unknown and it's almost certain than an employee will see very little in the case of a typical exit. The only kind of employee you can hire in this case is somebody who can't get a stable job elsewhere: you'll be giving him legitimate experience to put on his resume in return for his work. That isn't a bad deal if you can accurately identify potential (and if you are unable to give them more responsibility and a higher salary in a year, ready for them to leave as soon as get find something else) or have enough money to hire and fire many times (with ""trial periods"" and the like), but this isn't your case. You can't identify potential, you can't afford to try and fail until you luck upon somebody with potential.<p>What you need is another founder, who can insert the critical technology DNA, re-state your problem as one technology can be (intelligently) applied to and who has the same stake as you in the company. This person can also identify further talent (including the kind of talent you will need: engineers who have great potential, but are green and need _any_ kind of experience; they need experienced hackers to mentor them).<p>Where do you find this person? Problem is that you can't, unless you already know them. That's why companies like YC are very fuzzy about founders who have known each other and have a strong bond. Is there an engineer you've worked with (in a business role) who the company has pulled all stops (before) to keep, but who secretly yearns to have more of say in the product (and not just do what a product manager tells him)? Is there a classmate from college who absolutely wowed you? Is there an engineer you hear great things from your unknown-quality engineer friends? That's the person you want.<p>Again, I'd also like to state this isn't just about the money, other than the fact you've been able to raise funding has set you aside from most ""idea"" guys (to whom my general response would consist of a crude ASCII drawing). Just having money, doesn't mean you can get great talent: you must be ready to offer is challenge, responsibility and product ownership (and that means giving up a large part of your mental and monetary stake in the startup). Expect most people you reach out to to reject you (but I'd imagine you are ready for this and have experienced this plenty in the process of raising funding).",1297813503

Benchmarks aren't real world applications. I don't care if it takes 1s rather than 0.5s to run 1,000,000 operations, if all I ever need to do is run 5 of them.<p>2. The post you linked to is well over two years old. The entire web development world looked very different back then, and the possibilities of using JS and web apps for more serious work were in their infancy. At that point, Chrome did have a decisive advantage over all other browsers (not just IE) in JS execution speed, but of course that's just after Google had incorporated their new JS engine but before any of the more recent Firefox improvements and certainly not taking into account today's imminent releases like IE9.<p>3. I don't know what all those numbers are meant to mean, because there is no methodology information in the post you linked to. Charts and numbers without context prove nothing, rather like the ""infographics"" in the original article we're discussing here.<p>4. Even if you insist on using benchmarks, more recent ones (e.g., those highlighting jQuery 1.5 performance in some navigation features, published a few days ago) have IE9 still slower than other browsers, but more like a factor of 2-5 slower than the orders of magnitude it was just a few years ago. If they carry on improving at the rate they have been since IE7 -- keeping in mind that this seems to be one of their goals, and that the important context here is whether the IE team is following a healthy path for the future rather than whether they are better right now -- then we can expect IE10 to be directly competitive with the engines in other browsers.<p>As an aside, those few jQuery figures are a great example of the difference between real world usage and synthetic benchmarks. jQuery is a reasonably reputable bit of software, and the difference in performance in some basic document navigation tools -- hardly high-level code, but a step up from built-in JS/DOM functionality -- was as wide between jQuery 1.4.4 and jQuery 1.5 as it was between various pairs of browsers they tested.<p>> If you point is that we should just be happy with the web that ie6 supports<p>I've never said anything like that, anywhere in this discussion.<p>As it happens, I do think the latest HTML5/CSS3 features tend to be more about trend-setting than actually making web development more useful. If you want to make it useful, fire the guy at the W3C who thinks CSS shouldn't have tools like named constants and arithmetic, which web developers have been asking for since forever, and which everyone from programmers to those working in DTP considers entry level.<p>> Personally I think we are still at an early stage of realising how computing can benefit our lives, for the last 5 years ie has been significantly slowing that progress down,<p>How is that, exactly? IE has made a small impact in the speed of development of web sites. As we've seen, with competition to drive the market, Microsoft can still develop new browsers, they just chose not to for several years after IE6.<p>In any case, your point seems to assume that browsers are the only significant means for computers to benefit our lives, which is just crazy. If you want a disruptive technology, look at the iPhone: in just a few years, it has redefined the entire markets of both mobile computing and telecommunications, to the point where it's difficult to find any recent mobile phone that doesn't have a high-res touchscreen or any mobile platform that doesn't support installing custom software applications on the device, helping Apple climb back from relative obscurity in the PC world to one of the largest global brands in the process.<p>By the way, IE9 supports media queries -- a recent CSS feature that does have current widespread applicability -- just fine.<p>(Edit: Am I really being downvoted for arguing that qualitative factors and general policies/focus are more important than synthetic benchmarks, when the only quantitative data provided by the person criticising me for not citing hard numbers is one single blog post, from more than two years ago, containing a few numbers based on synthetic benchmarks, with no description of methodology to let us judge what if anything those numbers signify?)",1297813040

The world did not operate according to your desires; someone else barged in and interrupted it, stopping you from moving forward.

What if you find out soon after that it was because that person had a stroke right there at the choke point?  If you are like most normal people in this situation, you will suddenly experience a mix of emotions: lightened anger (it is still there, since things did not go your way), a sense of shame (oh, they had a really good reason, and you were really targeting them), a touch of concern, and a bit of relief that something in the world makes some sense.<p>In the absence of this information, having nothing but your own viewpoint to go on, you would have remained angry, even angrier as time passed.  With somebody else's viewpoint, suddenly it seems unjustified to an extent.  Amazing how seeing through another's eyes changes the emotion.",1297812676

You'll lose some international protection, but it's quite hard to stay internationally protected anyway. I am <i>not</i> a lawyer, please don't trust me.<p>If neither you nor the person who wants to join the company are developers, then I would pause until you've found one. 250k is not a lot of money to build anything non-trivial, and you'll burn through it unbelievably fast if there's not a founding member who is highly technical and can evaluate how good other technical employees are going to be. If you're paying salaries and other expenses, 250k keeps a team of 5 going for like 6 months. It usually takes 3 months to raise a follow-on round, which gives a team of 5 three months to build something exciting enough to raise follow-on investment. If it's you and one or two technical co-founders, you can run an awful lot longer. If you're just paying spartan living expenses, you can get it as low as 5k per person per month (in the valley).<p>If you take the money, chances are you'll fail. Are these experienced investors who can afford the loss? Are you okay with losing that money? If they can deal with it and you can deal with it, then I suggest you take it and stay <i>very</i> thrifty for a while while you figure out what's what. Get them to invest in you and the space, not in this particular product idea (since it will likely change and you want their support if that happens).<p>Personally, I'd take it. Money's great and you can get a lot done in a few months. But only if you're willing to commit. I spent 3 or 4 years working in a space I didn't care that much about because once you have a employees and investors, it's really hard to let go.<p>As for steps:
1) Figure out what you want
2) Find a badass developer cofounder
3) Take the money
4) Developer starts building product while you start securing first customers/users/partners, adjusting the product as you go based on your learning from talking to people",1297812409

I'd love to see employment in the U.S. either regress and become much more static or move forward towards a more dynamic model like this. In the '50's and '60's, being an employee of a company carried a certain set of obligations. You were a ""company man"" and, in exchange for doing your time and climbing the ladder, you'd be taken care of with a pension, great health care and near-guaranteed employment. Now, the benefits are almost all gone and that makes long-term employment with one company a suckers' game barring extraneous circumstances. Some places hire long-term contractors, but I don't think this is what the article is talking about as long-term contracts generally carry the same demands on your time as a full-time job does, making it much more difficult to keep several irons in the fire, so to speak. This patchworking concept is, as I see it, the ideal circumstance for someone who knows their shit and can get things done.<p>However, the link doesn't say very much about the obvious problem with the model it advocates. How do you convince companies that they can, in fact, get work from part-time patchworkers that is just as good as the work they get from full-time employees? I understand that there is a mentality that assumes you can't manage someone who isn't in the office, but I don't know how to disabuse someone of that notion and replace it with a results-based view of work. THAT, to me, is the lynchpin to breaking out of the 9-to-5 rut, and I'm not sure how to convince a business that the code I wrote at 3 am in my living room can do their work just as well as the code I'd be writing at 11 am in their offices.

And finally CalTrain, which is responsible for covering San Francisco all the way down to San Jose (And a few cities afterwards - I've never been further south than San Jose)<p>Right now - when I'm coming home, or heading to the City, I only have to wait a bit longer outside of commuting hours.  During Commuting hours, I usually just walk onto the train, and, if it's a bullet, I will be home faster than any car can get me there.<p>The elimination of the local stations, is _not_ a good thing.  People who wanted to avoid those would take the express anyways.  Now - you have no ability to get to those cities with caltrain.<p>Also, look at the Southbound schedule (Northbound is a reflection):<p>11 Trains Leaving, from 5:45 AM to 6:55 AM, And in the afternoon, 11 Trains leaving from 3:45 to 4:55 PM.<p>This is not a ""drastic service cut"" - this is a complete gutting of the peninsula transit system.

You reuse <i>masses</i> of OO code every time you write a non-trivial program using a modern standard library.<p>I think the people making this criticism are looking in the wrong place for the reuse, and / or had weird ideas of what could be reused, and how it could be reused, to begin with.<p>The reuse that OO gives us comes from raising the level of abstraction with which the program is written, in particular because runtime libraries are so much larger (""batteries included"", etc.). The hierarchical namespaces and encapsulated structure of modern class libraries reduces their cognitive overhead. For example, in .NET, you can work with WebRequest, TcpClient or Socket, depending on what level of control you need; and the conventions for working with these things are pretty uniform across the board. Larger applications are self-similarly written at a higher level, reusing code <i>within themselves</i> in a framework-like way.<p>But the people who thought there was going to be some kind of central library of domain-specific classes in your company, that you would reuse in multiple disparate applications, I think that was always fairly naive; reuse implies coupling, and coupling of things that are individually subject to change in ways that affects their users is fraught with problems, and always has been.<p>The best candidates for reuse aren't usually representations of the domain concepts that are central to a business, because each application in the business will probably be wanting to do something quite unique with those domain classes. Rather, it's concepts that are self-contained, universal, not likely to change much over time nor need different intrinsic behaviour from application to application, which are best suited to reuse.",1297811187

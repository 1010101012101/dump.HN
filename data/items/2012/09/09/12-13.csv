If one firm has a lot of added value and another is dumb money, why should they get the same price?<p>If you look at it another way, if they are the same firms offering the same deals (at different prices) but instead of joining together in a round, they are competing, surely you would recognise the added value. Why not in a joint round?",1347195582

No one wants to pay for music entertainment?<p>I posed it as a question, if people are not prepared to pay for something (e.g they download it for free), it because it is priced wrong (too high). That doesn't mean all music is priced too high.<p>> Substitute your profession above for artists. Do you feel the same? Everyone is inspired from things which came before them, and yes you can profit off of your new creation which has been influenced from culture which has come before you.<p>You can't substitute any profession over the top.  Arts are intrinsically different, their value is much harder to calculate.  This has long been discussed throughout history, it is only in very recent history that some of the arts have become a 'profession'.<p>> Top 3: Shakespeare, Beowulf, The Odyssey. The publishing companies who printed these books and spent the time typesetting, translating them etc aren't making money?<p>Right...not the artist.. That is a strange argument to make.  In all those cases, the artist is long died, and someone (else) is trying to make a buck off of their work... Copyright is only meant to last the life time of the author + 50(?) years... So Shakespeare and Homer are really bad examples in a copyright debate.<p>> This argument only seems to come up in context to books/music/movies.<p>This argument comes up every time there is a major shift in how people act/produce.  The same 'debate' occurred when the printing press destroyed monopolies on books... Who's response was: Copyright.<p>> it isn't some noble cause, it is because you don't rely on that industry to put food on the table, are cheap, and can get your entertainment online for free instead.<p>Nice ad hominem.

If you are a young person and aspire to ""middle class"" employment, in 90% of cases you need a 4-year degree. The reason this is true is simply because potential employers will prefer an applicant vetted by a college admissions council versus a not-vetted candidate. It's a basic signalling arms race.<p>2. Many professions such as law and medicine legally require purchase of the appropriate degree. There is no option for apprenticing or self-study and sitting the licensing exams without the degree. If you want the profession, you are required by state law to buy in. And the degree-supplying institutions have no qualms about ""finessing"" employment/income statistics (if they even pretend to collect them) and the like to give the impression entrance in such professions is like winning the lottery.<p>So you have two sources of basically inelastic demand for these little sheets of paper from young people anxious to find a seat in society. If you are a supplier of such sheets of paper, how do you exploit this situation for maximum profit? After all, 18 year olds don't have the cash in their pockets to be defrauded of. The solution, of course, is the federal government.<p>Make a deal with the federal government that in exchange for risk-free blank checks from the federal taxpayer, you, the degree-supplier, will graciously grant these poor 18 year old saps with seals of approval from your fine academic institution. Once you have have this deal arranged, blow tuition through the roof, say 500%+ in the past 10 years, with precisely 0 correlation to actual costs or say competition in some sort of ""free market"" where firms are actually exposed to ""risk"" etc. Congratulations sir, you are now wealthy. You won America!<p>Oh, it's not fair to indenture teenagers with mortgage-equivalent debts at usurious interest rates for a service most first world nations provide for free or limited expense? Doesn't matter: 'merica.<p>Oh, it's not constitutional to disallow discharge of these exploitation debts in bankruptcy? Doesn't matter: 'merica.<p>I think basically the question is: why aren't we fucking over young people more? I think if they want a college/professional degree we should make them sign contracts like ""In exchange for this most valuable degree, any money I ever earn over $30,000 annually for the rest of my life goes straight to Uncle Sam, and/or the appropriate collections agency"".",1347195099

After three or four iterations of ""defining"" questions and answers, the person I was helping said in exasperation ""can't you just give me the code now""?  To which I responded, ""I don't have the code you need ... but I can help you understand how to write it"".<p>The person's response is indicative of a certain type of person that I no longer try to help.  He said ""thanks for wasting so much of my time"".  How is educating someone a waste of their time?  I guess it might have been more a waste of my time (especially given our relative level of expertise and pay grades).<p>So now I rarely give out code and often tell people up front that I won't.  If they want to learn, I'm happy to help them learn and I am constantly amazed at the additional insights I gain during these interchanges.

CPS is for the compiler writer, not for the programmer.<p>The underlying problem is that sequential languages do bad when you ""bolt on"" concurrency to them - unless said language is expressive enough to make it bearable (Haskell and some MLs come to mind). For all other language, you are just frankensteining your system.<p>The reactor-model, of which Twisted, Node.js and a couple of like systems are built around has one advantage: It is fairly easy to get going. It is by far the simplest model you can get bolted onto a system with relative ease. The crux of the problem is that we have a lot of sequentially oriented programmers who suddenly need to do full concurrency. This is the first attempt.<p>To a professional Erlang programmer like me, it does look rather odd that one would hail a reactor model as being anything decent to work with. There are other concurrent calculi out there, which may be better than what Erlang provides, but none of them worries about callbacks in the style of Node.<p>I have a hunch the kid must be dragged screaming into the concurrency shop.",1347194095

If you end up in that kind of position, it can be very hard to get back out of it, so most people, especially from less-well-off backgrounds, put a large premium on minimizing the risk of getting into it in the first place. Hence, a preference for ""safe"" jobs at larger companies.<p>(Part of the problem is that what does exist of a safety net in the U.S. moves at a glacial pace, and is geared towards chronically poor people. For example, housing assistance programs typically have years-long waiting lists, so they serve the exact opposite use-case from the person who needs a place to live ASAP, but only for a few months until they can pay their own rent again.)",1347193334

If you write small - medium rails apps, then the db is usually just dumb storage and if you are careful to use the ORM properly, then DBs are just plug and play.

We absolutely need to accept that jobs are a cost, not a benefit.<p>But the article goes way off the rails towards the middle:<p><i>""But capitalism as such is not interested in quality of life. It is essentially a system for producing things to sell at a profit, the greater the better.""</i><p>This is silly. Insofar as capitalism makes normative claims, the claims are merely that people should be able to do as they wish with their own property. It also makes the positive claim that allowing people to do this will typically increase utility for all market agents.<p>I'm also not sure what the heck he is talking about in the conclusion - people without a liberal education are unable to make their own choices about what to buy?

The triggers that define the rules can cover as many or as few contacts as you wish ie 'anyone I have a meeting with in the next 48 hrs' can be a trigger, or simply based on email content, pre-defined contact groups etc. In most cases this is a handful of rules.<p>Email rules that are setup within the client or service restrict filtering to contact, folder, content (in some cases). We can react to data that's outside of your inbox, anything from your relationship to the contact based on another web service, to accessing, storing, and sharing with services you use regularly. Beyond this triggers such as time, email load (driven from analytics), location can all come into play. We are really just getting started with the possibilities, a way to interact with custom web apps would be great for developers/companies that use bespoke tools.",1347192959

The Dijkstra quote is really old (Wikipedia dates it to 1975) and do not talk about &quot;modern Basic&quot; we know, with a good support for structured programming -- it&#x27;s about a language where GOTO&#x27;s were used instead of proper loops.

But over the years I&#x27;ve been bitten by it enough times to know better.<p>IIFEs are the most common source of semicolon problems:<p><pre><code>    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++){\n        x = arr[i]\n        (function(x) {\n            setTimeout(function(){console.log(x)})\n        })()\n    }\n</code></pre>\nA less common sort of pattern that I still use pretty often as a DRY measure:<p><pre><code>    init()\n    [x, y, z].forEach(function(a){\n        if(a.length > 5) {\n            process(a)\n        }\n    })\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is clean and readable, and without semicolons it&#x27;s completely wrong.<p>Now sure, you can prepend semicolons to these specific cases, and that will work. Here&#x27;s why I dislike that:<p>1. Those leading semicolons look <i>weird</i>. To the uninitiated, it looks like a typo, and that&#x27;s a significant hazard if anyone else is going to touch your code.<p>2.

How many of your cust personas would use your new proposed feature? Is there a persona that would actually dislike your change? How do would you address their concerns?<p>Equally important is to build out the personas that are not your customers. They may have a lower price, higher support/acq costs, or features you can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t build.

Your customers\nare in such and such an age group, are of this gender, and earn within a given \nsalary range. All that info may be useful to know, but it’s not the way\nto penetrate the minds of your customers.<p>To really feel empathy and understand what your customers want, what\nconfuses them, and what inspires them, you need to get personal. You can’t\nput yourself into the shoes of a whole demographic, but is possible to imagine\none typical prospective customer and get to know that person better.<p>Let’s say that your company sells educational iPad applications that are\ndesigned for young children. Who is your prospective customer? Well, let’s\nsee. She is a mom; let’s call her Laura. How old is she? Let’s say 33. OK, how\nmany children does Laura have? Probably two. What ages? Hmm, a three-year-old \ndaughter and a five-year-old son. What’s her profession? She used\nto be an accountant, but now she does bookkeeping for small businesses\nfrom home so that she can spend more time raising her kids.<p>You get the idea. You can use this thought process to create a detailed profile\nof a possible customer and ask yourself questions in your head to get to know\nyour target users better. Now assume that Laura doesn’t know about your\niPad applications and you want to reach her through your blog.<p>Will Laura find you when researching Objective-C vs. JavaScript-based mobile\napps? Well, based on Laura’s profession, that’s very unlikely. What does\nLaura, a concerned parent who wants the best for her children, care about?\nWhat worries Laura? What is Laura’s main objective? What’s her problem in\nrelation to the solution that you have to offer?<p>It’s easier now to understand your customer because you can imagine how\nthis person would react to what you write. You can also better assess what\nkind of questions your customer has and answer them. If you are an iPad\ndeveloper, you may take many of your customers’ questions for granted.<p>What is obvious to you may not be to Laura. When you think about Laura, you can\ncome up with all sort of questions that your posts should answer:<p>• Are iPads safe for young children to use?<p>• Is the iPad a good educational tool for children ages three to six?<p>• Can you use a pen to write on the iPad screen?<p>• What are some clever ways to use mobile devices to encourage children to learn?<p>• Are there fun iPad games aimed at young children?<p>• Is an iPad or an Android tablet better for educational purposes?<p>• Should parents buy their children an iPad?<p>• What can children learn through the iPad?<p>• What are the best iPad apps for young kids to use?<p>• Should children spend their time on the iPad?<p>• How do I teach mathematics to preschool kids?<p>• What software can teach young children how to read?<p>• Is software beneficial for the development of your child’s brain?<p>• How can you assess and improve your child’s IQ?<p>• How can you prepare your children for elementary school?<p>• How can parents and children use the iPad together to learn and bond?<p>• What’s the difference between the iPad Wi-Fi and the iPad Wi-Fi + 3G?<p>These are just a few random examples of questions your posts could answer.\nNotice that some of these questions aren’t even iPad specific. Laura is interested\nin her kids’ education first and the iPad is just a tool that can help her\nwith that goal. Talk about the iPad by all means, but focus on what the\ncustomer really wants to know.<p>Though this exercise may appear silly, you really need to connect with your\ncustomers at this depth in order to help them find your blog and, in turn,\nyour products. Put yourself into their shoes, and if you have access to early\ncustomers, listen to what they tell you so as to better gauge what you can do\nto address their questions.",1393088820

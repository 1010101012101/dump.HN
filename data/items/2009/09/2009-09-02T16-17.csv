800572,comment,800450,800487,0,0,hexis,,,"Some profitable companies operated at a loss for extended period of time at first. Sure, nobody disagrees with that. The point of the post was that it isn't the operating at a loss that makes a business a success, no matter how large the revenue stream. Operating at a loss may turn out to have been worth it, in retrospect, once the profits start rolling in.<p>It may even be the case that great business success is always preceded by years of operating at a loss. Let's assume that for the sake of discussion. It still doesn't show that any company that operates at a loss, no matter how large the revenue stream, is going to be a great business success. And it certainly doesn't show that the business, while operating at a loss, is currently a success. Operating at a loss, with a large revenue stream, <i>may</i> be a necessary condition of success, but it surely isn't a sufficient condition.",1251910668

800561,comment,800450,800450,0,0,illumen,,,"I think this article is wrong for three reasons.  Products can be successful without businesses being successful.  Success is determined by meeting your own goals.  Acquiring paying customers is a business success.<p>A piece of software can be very popular and successful, even if there is no direct business correlation.<p>Not everything can be easily correlated.  Even 37signals own rails isn't being charged for in many situations.  How much extra value has giving away rails done for 37signals?  Giving some things away for free can be considered a marketing expense... an expense where you get to do what you like best - making software.<p>If a painting doesn't sell for a lot of money, is it a successful painting?<p>Seriously... there's <i>lots</i> of software bringing joy, and helping people do stuff - not all of it has to be making money.<p>If the business plan is to make something cool, then eventually pay off the investment... then that's a success.  Success is merely meeting of goals.<p>So this company, has made something people like and use, and also give them money for.  They are also on their path to paying back their investment, and gotten a lot of cred, press, and <i>customers</i> in the meantime.<p>Software companies almost always make multiple products.  So gaining a lot of customers with early products is a great way to bootstrap things.  Then the software company can more easily sell stuff to their existing customers.<p>They've met their own criteria for success and other peoples.<p>So this article misses out on how a product can be a popular success without the business being a financial success.  It also misses out on how, if they are meeting their goals they are a success.  Finally it misses the business goal of acquiring customers who like what they do and pay them money... in their first product.<p>In this case the New York Times has more of a leg to stand on than 37signals.",1251910438

It's the same reason that everyone here loves businesses based on technology. It's the same reason that VCs are willing to invest millions of dollars in nascent companies which will, in all likelihood, fail in the near future. It's the same reason I spend my evenings working on my own startup.<p>The reason is scalability.<p>My dad was always shocked that investors valued the last startup I worked for in the tens of millions of dollars while we were losing money. He's worked in construction his whole life for firms that do on the order of $100MM in revenue per year. Like all construction firms, however, their margins are razor thin. Their revenue doesn't grow much faster than their costs (employees and materials, primarily).<p>A construction company that loses money is not going to be worth $50MM any time soon. A tech company with similar financials <i>might be</i>. A tech company might take a while to get their technology right. But when they do, they can leverage it. Their revenues can grow <i>far faster</i> than their costs. Software as a product scales better than just about anything I can think of. Software businesses often go from slightly in the red to huge annual profits in very little time.<p>Everyone in tech is trying to find the Next Big Thing. This includes us (entrepreneurs), the media, and investors. In the case of the media, they're just trying to be the first ones to break the next big story, as usual. Just like investors, if they want to succeed, they have to be willing to take risks. They have to bet on companies that look like they have potential. Sometimes they're wrong. But in those rare cases where it pays off, it usually pays off big.<p>Other industries lack this quality. In other industries 1 success is not going to make up for 10 failures. In technology you make money by picking winners before everyone else. It's somewhat of a crap shoot. But the bar is low because the potential reward is high.",1251909872

Different metrics will produce different results. But a quick perusal of some alternative metrics:<p>* How much more do we understand about the world now than we did, and how much of this knowledge is used by engineers in technology?<p>* How many more bits (from an information theoretic standpoint) does it take to describe our technology? (Probably my favorite, as it most directly captures what I think most people are getting at. Not perfect, though, as it's not true that more bits > less bits... however, that's a decent first approximation given the scale involved.)<p>* How much do certain things cost in man-hours, then vs. now? (For instance, see <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/opinion/10cox.html?_r=1&ref=opinion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/opinion/10cox.html?_r=1&#3...</a> )<p>Given the wide variety of other <i>far</i> more useful metrics, ""how much has my everyday life changed"" should be rather far down on the list of metrics you want to use. By most useful metrics, technology progress has indeed accelerated and continues to accelerate. That we have a bit of an intermediate area here where we're putting together the necessary bits to really open up the throttle again shouldn't be that surprising; robotics, nanotechnology, and biological technology are not easy things... but we're getting there, one bit at a time. And those things will further open up other secondary effects, like private space travel being both practical and useful (for resource extraction). I don't think it's unreasonable that we'll get at least one good energy breakthrough either, probably either an alternative fusion technology or practical satellite solar power of some sort (though that may be 15 or 20 years off, the technology necessary is a fairly simple extrapolation of existing trends, not requiring any magic).<p>Enjoy this moment of apparent quiet, where all the action is on the Internet.

This is easy to accidentally do, because it is much easier to see the people who really jumped all over lighting, and telephone in the past when looking from now. Further it is much more common to write about those people than it is to write about the smiths, who not keeping up with the Joneses, didn't get the telephone for another decade.  There were plenty of places in the us that only used outhouses into the 70's. Horses were used for plowing and whatnot into the 1950's (tractors having been around for decades at that point).<p>My point is, in 50 years we will be writing about the curve the internet took, and my children's kids will grow up believing everyone did this internet thing fluently.  It will be hard to explain to them how a lot of my contemporaries will never quite get it.  Much like I still can't quite wrap my head around the telephone troubles my grandfather's parents seemed to have.<p>I guess the point is, there really is not a good way of measuring impact of technology until we can look back and go, ""woah, that was a big change!"" or ""what a dud!"". Compare  period write-ups of the future of zepplins or pneumatic tubes, to current reality.",1251907260

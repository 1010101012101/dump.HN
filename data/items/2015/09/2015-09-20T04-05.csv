Then in a clean room, the gold film would be covered by a photoresistive chemical and placed in a machine similar to an enlarger in a darkroom, except it would shrink the image instead of enlarging. An A4 sized transparency containing the circuit design would be placed in the machine, which was optically shrunk to the (~2cm x 2cm) size of the glass and exposed with UV light. Finally, it was processed with chemicals to etch away the exposed gold, leaving the gold microcircuit traces.<p>I&#x27;m certain you could use this process to encode data with a scheme like PaperBack, and if you could find a substrate lighter than glass that both resisted delamination and could survive the etching chemical bath, the gold film could probably last for 100k+ years.",1442724666

It is a very hard problem, and when I left it we had declared it successful because we were something like 10% better than the current method, which is just to assume that current production will continue.<p>Wind power is a strange beast. A 300MW wind farm can go from 250MW to 0MW to 100MW over a 1-2 hour period. Trying to properly plan for that or ramping up/down your coal/gas plants to cover the changes is very difficult and expensive.",1442723824
10246577,comment,10245805,10245805,0,0,Animats,,,"This happens occasionally in the PJM control area, even without a subsidy.  PJM has a lot of nuclear and hydro plants in their territory. The nuclear plants don&#x27;t like to cut output at 4 AM when they&#x27;ll have to crank it up at 5:30 AM; the thermal time constants in the system are too big. So they&#x27;ll take an occasional hour of negative prices.<p>Hydro Quebec sometimes has too much water, in which case they run all their generators at capacity.  They, too, will take an hour of negative prices rather than closing huge steel intake gates and taking a generator out of service for an hour, only to have to go through the startup and resynch process an hour later.<p>Wind output in the PJM area varies about 4:1 over a typical day. When peak wind lines up with minimum power demand, prices go negative, the automatic bidding system communicates back to the wind turbines, and the blades go to zero pitch, slow, and stop.  The wind guys grumble about this, because some of them financed their operations without allowing for this. But it&#x27;s not frequent. Wind turbines are good at shutdown and startup resynch, because they have to do it every time the wind slows down below useful speed.",1442723790

Can you explain?<p>I think there might be misunderstanding of how analog computing is used to build a neural network. First, a weight is stored as some analog physical property, typically as charge on a floating gate, or on a capacitor in a DRAM type cell. Second, the multiplication operation is performed by modulating the analog input signal going through the floating gate transistor by the charge on the floating gate (weight). Third, the summation is done via simple summation of the currents. Finally, activation function is performed by an opamp.<p>Regarding power consumption: 
1. A digital computer needs a thousand of transistors to perform multiplication, analog circuit can do it with a single one. 
2. Analog NN stores parameters (weights) locally, right where they are needed to perform computation. Digital NN will need lots of memory transfers to bring weights from RAM to ALU, and to store intermediate results.<p>That&#x27;s why a properly implemented analog NN will always consume much less power.",1442721606

Even Debian Stable comes with 2.5.<p>BTW this rant about impossibility to upgrade is a classic one and nonetheless wrong. You're perfectly able to install new versions of python, or perl or whatever given that you do that in /usr/local to keep the official version alongside the new one. I do this all the time, my system comes with perl 5.10 but I regularly install the newest releases in /usr/local, or even development versions. No problem.",1285401441

FYI.<p>Running a scripting language VM is massive overhead on little devices like these. Consider that the Arduino, last I checked, has 16k of code space, and most microcontrollers are in the same range. The Python VM itself is already measured in megabytes. You're going to have to take several steps up the ladder in terms of hardware.<p>For further information:

If my ads didn't get run by Google, I'd just advertise somewhere else.<p>Honestly, Google is not that big of a company.  I checked out the Fortune 500 list, and Google is not even in the top 50.  Amazon.com, Bank of America, and CVS Carkemark know a lot more about you than Google.  And they don't care -- you come to them, and they sell you their product, and it's often a good deal for both sides.  Google is just like this, except smaller.<p>In the IT industry, we like to think that Google is important.  We see their logo a lot, we hear how nice it is to work there... but they are really small potatoes.  Advertising is nothing.  Giving people money, giving people drugs, selling gasoline, shipping books to your house overnight, and making light bulbs and jet engines is a lot more profitable than sending clicks to your website.  Sorry, that's the reality... there is a lot more evil to be done in the world than Google is capable of.  (Look at the number of Fortune 500 companies that are primarily military contractors.  Their corporate mandate is to <i>cause people to die</i> as efficiently as possible -- Google manages your RSS feeds and cat pictures!  Sorry, not evil.)<p>(Why isn't Google as heavily regulated as banks?  Because they really don't matter that much.  Yeah, you can search for your name on Google and see content that you put up on the web under your name.  But the banks collect information about you, to make business decisions, without you ever even knowing.  Right now, their computers are deciding whether or not you are a credit risk, and if they decide you are, they are canceling your credit card.  That vacation you wanted?  Gone.  That house you wanted?  Never.  That's power that Google simply doesn't even come close to having!)",1285401185

1726525,comment,1725592,1725592,0,0,RK,,,"By training I am a radiation physicist and actually do know about particle beams hitting people. The LHC beam would certainly give someone an appreciable radiation dose, although the secondary synchrotron X-rays would probably be worse than the proton beam itself. In fact a much lower energy proton beam would have a worse effect on your hand/body, since that beam would actually stop inside you (protons deposit most of their dose at the very end of their range).<p>Of course the injury you received would largely be determined by the length of time your hand was in the beam. Really not fun results can be radiation ulcers or radiogenic cancer. If the dose were high enough you could get a radiation syndrome, where some/all of the fast growing cells in your body die off and you die in a few days or months.<p>The only data I could find after a quick search indicated that the dose present in the beam line would be on the order of 10^4 Gy per year. That means if you managed to put your hand in the beam for 1 minute, you're only looking at about 0.01 Gy, which isn't that much.",1285399406

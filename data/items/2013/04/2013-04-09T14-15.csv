This may in fact be the simplest and most foundational bit of usability and user experience innovation the US could learn from Europe in intersection design.<p>1) Placing the signals on the leading edge means that the stop line is ~10 feet back from the intersection.  If you decide to ignore the stop line, you can't see the signals.  BAM instant conformance to proper road use.<p>2) Following on that, sitting 10 feet back from the intersection you can see everything in the intersection.  You can see pedestrians crossing in front of you and to the right of you.  You can see cyclists entering into the intersection and passing you far before you enter the intersection.  As a ped or cyclist this makes intersections much, much safer.<p>3) As you approach an intersection, and the light switches to yellow and then red, there can be no doubt about the state of the light as you enter the intersection.  You can't enter or pass through the intersection on a red light as you might in the US, because it will be red before you even get to the intersection.

5518442,comment,5517983,5518163,16,0,loganfrederick,,,"""Most billionaires are into preservation of capital in a big way.""<p>Depending on how you define ""are into"", this could be argued as empirically wrong. A study done by the editor of the updated edition of Graham's ""The Intelligent Investor"" shows that the Forbes 400 (400 Richest Americans) only had 68 members who stayed on the list from some time in the 1980 to the early 2000s. The author calculated the return required to stay on the list and it was approximately 4.8% annually, which is very reasonable with their level of resources.<p>Due to these results (only 68 out of 400 richest people staying in that position), you could say that billionaires are NOT into preservation of capital, when making 4% annually is not even accomplished.<p>The hypothesized reason for these results is that most billionaire's fortunes are tied to one or two major companies/investments. Fluctuations in business over time eventually devalue their investment in the single entity. If they really cared about ""preservation of capital"", they would liquidate more of their stakes when one company made them rich then diversify their holdings.<p>Apologies for the vague dates. I am at work and do not have the book handy, but just read that passage 48 hours ago. If someone replies that they want more specific numbers and references, I can update this post in 10 hours.<p>Reference: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Book-Practical-Counsel/dp/B0002X1JKU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Book-Practical-Co...</a>",1365519147

5518404,comment,5517552,5517552,8,0,StefanKarpinski,,,"This ""Magellanic view"" of programming language exploration doesn't seem quite right. Programming language design is mostly not about finding virgin territory by inventing brand new ideas (which was admittedly easier in the era when high-level languages were brand new – i.e. in the 1950s). Rather, it's mostly about finding unexplored folds hidden nearby in the vast, combinatorial manifold of ways to combine existing ideas in a single, coherent language. In my experience, people who have spent a lot of time designing languages are the <i>most</i> sympathetic to people trying new permutations – precisely because they are so painfully aware of all the awful compromises they were forced to make in their own designs and their understanding that much better ways of combining those features might be so tantalizingly close.<p>Scala is a great example: the innovation of the language is not so much in new language features, but rather in its ingenious combination of so many powerful features into a single, coherent system. Of course, some may argue that Scala has too many features (I'm a bit terrified of it), but it's indisputable that putting all those pieces together in a way that works is tour de force of language design.",1365518861

For one company I worked for, we actually found PostgreSQL was outperforming Oracle and because of how comprehensive our test suite was, the lead dev connected to PostgreSQL and got 80% of the test suite passing in one evening. A strong test suite allows you to <i>instantly</i> find out where your app breaks down.<p>Side note for those who don't believe PostgreSQL can outperform Oracle: we needed a custom data type that we were aggregating over. The projected table size was over a billion rows (last I heard it had reached over 4 billion rows). As I recall, in Oracle, you were limited to writing user-defined data types in SQL or Java (now you can use C). PostgreSQL, being open source, allowed the leave to implement the custom data type in C. The query we needed in Oracle took several minutes to run due to the need to constantly serialize/deserialize the data over the aggregation. The PostgreSQl version returned in a few seconds.<p>We even hired a well-known Oracle performance consultant who did wonderful things to all of our queries ... except for this one custom data type which left him stumped.",1365518006

My parents worked hard to take care of me and my sisters. Did I see them all the time? nope. Was I bothered? nope. At the end of the day whenever I needed them they would drop everything and show up. We never had dinner at the table, as a matter of fact I pretty much up and moved out when i was 17. But we're a very close family. As for my marriage, despite how hard we tried to maintain it, one can't control feelings, and eventually we realized that even though we were comfortable with each other, we couldn't get those feelings back.<p>Now, I don't know Elon Musk, and quite frankly I think there's a bit too much hero worship surrounding him - don't get me wrong, he does some crazy stuff, but he's not as much a sage entrepreneur as we make him out to be. Having said that, the reality is that life is a lot more complicated than what it looks like on Little House on the Prairie. A ""close family"" doesn't have to sit around the table and chat, a close family doesn't even have to have members who live in the same country - I'm a case in point. So people talking about how he's some bad father as if they live with him or know him personally should go focus on their own personal lives. And to John Battelle's, quite frankly rude statement at SXSW, well he works at a media company that hosts conferences, not running and re-imagining two pillars of heavy industry.",1365517988

Also lots of managers, who work at STEM companies, and perhaps may have even started as STEM people long ago, get confused as currently being STEM people.<p>There is an interesting effect that is also not being discussed which is most of the billionaires are paper net-worth billionaires.  Most of them don't have a billion cash equivalent on hand, for example if they sold 50% of their company stock, the stock price would crater enough because of sudden volume to take their net worth down quite a notch.  Its quite possible to end up in a situation where you own a billion sized fraction of a multibillion dollar company, but you can only sell a couple million per year without cratering your net worth.

You go on to give plenty of examples (FYI--some of these are already being done such as self-driving cars and flexible displays) but all of them, to truly build, would require a solid understanding of mathematics/physics/some type of engineering right? Not every billionaire has that knowledge. Elon Musk does--I believe he has a degree in physics from Penn and dropped out from the PhD program at Stanford. This knowledge simple does not exist among the majority of billionaires. And exactly because of this lack of knowledge, I don't think billionaires CAN actually do 'really cool sci=f sh!#'.<p>When you think of a crazy idea, out of the first few questions that come to your mind, one of them is probably, ""Is this idea feasible?"" To Musk, the idea of Tesla and SpaceX were both feasible, BECAUSE he had the necessary base knowledge in those areas to realize that with money, these visions could become realities. I like to think many people, other billionaires included, have had the idea of cool battery charged vehicles but without the ability to realize it is possible (aka the base knowledge), they stopped at that. Good or bad, this is most likely the reality of it.<p>All of that being said, I would like to see billionaires do what J.P. Morgan and George Westinghouse did for Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla, respectively--and that is to find and fund geniuses with these revolutionary, futuristic, 'really cool sci-fi sh!#' ideas. If more billionaires sought out to find scientists/engineers working on 'the next big thing', I imagine more would happen and newer, more fascinating, industries would be formed.<p>My plea: If you're a billionaire who appreciates what people like Elon Musk has done/is doing but don't have the skills to do so yourself, go find more people like him (in the sense that they have crazy futuristic ideas) and help them to help the world.",1365517275

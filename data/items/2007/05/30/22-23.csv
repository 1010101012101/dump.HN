Most of the folks I know who start businesses (and I know a lot of them these days) aren't grading themselves on ""number of fancy items owned"".  In fact, people who start businesses seem to be less impressed by the trappings of wealth than most.  pg rolls in a Mazda 3, and I don't recall ever seeing any particularly expensive cars in the YC lot, even when Joe Kraus, Evan Williams, Ron Conway, etc. were there (though I may not have been paying attention).<p>When you run a business revenues are a measure of how much you're building something good, so you want high revenues because you want to know you're building something good.  It has nothing to do with what you plan to buy with the money.",1180565674
25521,comment,25280,25280,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"People seem to really dislike frameworks and I know they can be more trouble then they are worth at times but I really like TurboGears. It's python based, sits on top of CherryPy (webserver) and you can take as much or as little as you need. It has a great philosophy of pulling in all thats good from all over the python world and loosely coupling it together in to a framework. It's not perfect by an means but it's a lot better then inventing that wheel again!",1180565658

Wasn't that what it was originally launched as, and they changed later because people thought it was pronounced ""twatter""? (Or because it took off and the domain was available, but I remember techcrunch readers joking about the unfortunate domain)",1180562589

Computer science is primarily about abstract concepts, and not so much about necessarily doing anything worthwhile with them.  (This is similar to saying, ""Why doesn't physics teach me to build X?""  Because that's mechanical engineering!)  Admittedly, there's hopefully some occasion to apply the concepts, rather than just memorize them, but the focus should be on the science, not the engineering.<p>In my curriculum, software engineering was one of my possible senior classes (including OSes, compilers, etc., almost all focused on application).",1330861923

As others have commented, people don't comparison shop even if they could. It's a bit like having no idea how a car works or what could be wrong with it, and then being asked to pick the best mechanic and strategy to fix it. Except of course, that it's not a car but your life or somebody else's depending on the right choice. I think it's unrealistic to expect a working market economy to develop under such circumstances.<p>One or multiple big entities negotiating prices and dictating treatment comes at the cost of less freedom for the providers and also less freedom for the consumers. Whether it gives better or worse care I wouldn't be too sure - on the one hand, special cases won't get specialised treatment, on the other hand trusting the decision of what needs to be done effectively to the provider sounds like it will cause over-treatment.<p>The freedom aspect probably drives the USA to the current system, but given the measurable effects, it just seems like bad policy.",1330860640

3662548,comment,3661947,3661947,1,0,Craiggybear,,,"I agree that involving beginners with OOP is a distraction -- albeit a very important principle. But they must be able to write their own modules, functions and classes first then be comfortable with exporting those <i>then</i> OOP can come naturally from that. Most software is still highly procedural in nature (while it may consume and refer to objects) and even in languages like Python where everything is an object you can still write software that has a clearly defined beginning, middle and end. Once you have a handle on all that, you can then start utilising the objects and their properties and that is huge fun in Python and Ruby.",1330859518

3662544,comment,3661947,3661947,29,0,edtechdev,,,"This is stuff educational researchers have known for over 20 years, and theorists have known for 100 years (John Dewey).  It's called situated cognition.  Learning happens in context.  You have to give students a <i>reason</i> to learn, not just learn something for its own sake.  It explains why for example a Brazilian street kid may be a whiz at math, and a 6 year old may have hundreds of Pokemons memorized.  See for example the work by James Paul Gee or Jean Lave.  John Dewey said 100 years ago that we shouldn't educate just to prepare kids for a future they know and care little about, we should educate them for today, teach them stuff that is useful and interesting to them today.<p>An example of my own - at 9 my father attempted teaching me programming with basic - I thought it was pretty boring all that work just to draw a US flag on the screen, especially compared to the videogames I was playing.  I was similarly bored with a basic programming class in high school and a survey of programming languages (lisp, C++) class in college (worst class I ever took in my life, actually).<p>It wasn't until early college when I started making CGI web applications, games, and educational software that I learned real programming and saw the value of it (along with the value of similarly boring calculus/linear algebra stuff).<p>I disagree with the author of this article's put down of GameMaker and similar tools.  Python was not designed for beginners, and neither was Javascript, of course.  Right now Scratch may be the best tool for teaching kids how to program, although it is very limited and not so great for creating games as other tools.",1330859356

Your post was inspiring. Especially the title. I can relate having learned everything by myself. I also got a degree, and was asked to stay for a PhD but I declined wanting to make things happen rather than just study them. I am being called 'doctor' anyway by my clients, who are all Phds but they outsource the most difficult (as in we have no freaking idea how to wrap our head around this problem) to me. Even worked as a contractor for NASA if that means anything. It's not about the degree or what you have done. Everything we end up doing is to just prove ourselves that we can do it. The only reason you have to do your 'shit' ideas is to build up confidence and get more inspiration. When you are ready, your big idea will come to you. It is with you already but you can't see it, because you are not ready to look up that high. My feeling is that you will progress quickly. So stay in touch with that feeling of the big idea you are here to do, while learning as much as you can on your job, and work as much as you can on you side projects. They are the steps you need to climb to your big one. And know that you are carrying the big one with you. Also know that people will see that and as long as you don't claim it for yourself, will try to use it (and you) for their own purpose. So value yourself, you would not feel inspired if you did not have it in you. And post more inspiring articles :)",1330859046

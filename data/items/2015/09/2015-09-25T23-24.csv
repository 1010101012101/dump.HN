The web is a dumbed down version of older hypertext systems and hasn&#x27;t shaken that legacy in 25 years.<p>The real problem with the pace of innovation is these things weren&#x27;t trivial to build, that&#x27;s why the best we can do is incrementalism. And that comes from the foundation systems we use. When something near the bottom of a technology stack/pyramid offloads complexity to the top, it becomes a nightmare to get anything done.<p>For example, we don&#x27;t have a natural language command line for regular/stupid users. Instead we have point and grunt GUIs. That means apps have to be monolithic. Apps can&#x27;t work seamlessly with one another even if the underlying tech allows it.<p>And from that small bit of complexity we get billion dollar walled gardens.<p>More detailed read <a href=""http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pchiusano.github.io/2013-05-22/future-of-software.htm...</a><p>Instead of a simple standard interface for users to access various services we have <a href=""http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4dd4d1cf4bd7c8c90f000000-1200-924/craigslist%20andrew%20parker.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://static3.businessinsider.com/image/4dd4d1cf4bd7c8c90f0...</a> which kills discoverability and creates a constant drag on people to learn a million UIs.

10281465,comment,10279853,10280773,0,0,Netcob,,,"What most people forget when they are sitting at home being scared about &quot;rogue nation-states&quot; from across the globe, or worry more about dying by the hand of people with dangerously fluffy beards instead of losing a foot to diabetes, is that complete security simply doesn&#x27;t exist.<p>But what would <i>we</i> do if we wanted to provide total security? The naive and most popular approach is to give total control to the government. Not secure yet? More control then. Technology is the most promising way to achieve total control yet, and it&#x27;s actually growing much faster than any global threat.<p>Anytime I read an article about some spying technology, I can imagine those developers looking at the existing infrastructure and internet technologies, thinking &quot;we can totally do something to control this and that as well&quot;. That will actually be the &quot;office culture&quot; in places like the NSA. I know that&#x27;s how I would think if I was sure my organization was serving a legitimate purpose. My colleagues would agree, and we&#x27;d high-five each other about redirecting yet another stream of information into our system. And whenever anyone has any doubts, group-dynamics or -think will take care of that. And if that&#x27;s still not enough, maybe you need deeper philosophical help? <a href=""https://boingboing.net/2015/08/11/the-failed-writer-who-became-n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://boingboing.net/2015/08/11/the-failed-writer-who-beca...</a><p>With all those leaked documents, I&#x27;ve not even once heard about any limits. None. There&#x27;s no &quot;we&#x27;d like to know and control much more, but obviously we&#x27;ll stop at <i>that</i>&quot;. If you gave the CIA the ultimate device that could provide them with all the information about every single human being on the planet and would also allow them to kill any individual instantly, they would immediately start using that. They don&#x27;t want any oversight, they don&#x27;t want anyone to control them, they don&#x27;t want to have to respect anyone&#x27;s privacy. They think they have a certain mandate or duty, and those things are by nature standing in their way of fulfilling it.<p>These developers absolutely should hang their heads in shame. Because every last one of them should understand that their organizations won&#x27;t stop for ethical reasons, or deny themselves certain powers which should not be concentrated in the hands of a few people, no matter how well they think they mean. Being a &quot;real person&quot;, not being out to get the average joe (but still spying on him), and generally meaning well - that doesn&#x27;t make you any less guilty. At best it means you&#x27;re a naive idiot who trusts authority too much, at worst you don&#x27;t care and just want to play with your cool toys.<p>The world definitely isn&#x27;t all roses and sunshine. Just because you think you&#x27;re working for your country, making sure those who promise to protect it get all the help they could ever wish for and more, that doesn&#x27;t mean the things you create will actually be used for &quot;good&quot;. All it means is that someone further up now has more power than before, and they will use it the way everyone uses their power - to further their own interests. You simply hope your interests and theirs are the same and along the lines of &quot;sticking it to those terrorists&quot;, but if history has shown anything, it&#x27;s that power corrupts. I have zero doubt that those systems will be used against all of us eventually.",1443225568

Let me be a little more detailed.<p>Once you&#x27;ve built a system that&#x27;s both a protocol and an OS, you realize that putting an abstraction barrier between them is like building a cow by building two halves of the cow, then sewing them together.  It&#x27;s incredibly hard and the resulting cow doesn&#x27;t work very well.<p>Take a problem like identity.  Is this an OS problem, or a protocol problem?  Earlier I mentioned validation of message / content types.  Is this an OS problem, or a protocol problem?  Is the spinal column part of the cow-frontend, or the cow-backend?<p>These are just the most obvious examples.  For instance, the standard way of building protocols assumes that message processing isn&#x27;t transactional, and the OS is a dual-level store that loses its mind all the time.  If your OS is a single-level store, you can essentially use persistent sessions.  Which means you can get exactly-once messaging.  Which is a very desirable feature that&#x27;s impossible to achieve if you assume that the endpoints can lose their minds.<p>So the appropriate comparison is: build the front-end of a cow, and stitch it to the back end of an alligator, creating the mighty alligow; or, build a whole cow.<p>Granted, Urbit isn&#x27;t perfect and I&#x27;d hardly call it done, but the whole stack (counting apps!) is only 25K lines of code.  So the &quot;whole cow&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem appalling.  The alligow -- I wouldn&#x27;t even try.",1443225375

But why should the fact that someone didn&#x27;t think (or document their thoughts) on something be evidence of non-obviousness?<p>I think of touch UIs and the patents there, for example Apple&#x27;s rubber-band scrolling patent[2]. Sure, it&#x27;s quite probable that no one thought of this before if they weren&#x27;t designing touch UIs. And even if they were, they might have thought of that, plus several other ideas, while developing. Why should this make any difference?<p>For instance, no one has made scrolling that intentionally segfaults if you scroll fast enough (or insert other silly thing here). You won&#x27;t find prior art on this. Should it be eligible for a patent just because it&#x27;s novel? There should be some sort of criteria where the effort required to invent something is taken into account. If it&#x27;s likely to come about merely as a result of playing in the space, then what does the public gain by issuing a patent?<p>What knowledge is contained in the &quot;reverse PIN dials cops&quot; that merits protection? Even if nobody had that idea before (or bothered to document it), what does that matter? If you patent can be constructed just by asking a simple question (&quot;think of some ways to alarm when being robbed at an ATM&quot;), well that should be grounds for it not being valid.<p>Edit: Another example. Things like algorithms. Look at a simple database indexing system: ISAM. Sort your data, sample every so often to form an index. Repeat if the index is too large. Ta-da. Going back far enough, this was very novel. But any worker that had to figure this problem out would arrive at the same solution.

10281397,comment,10280186,10281209,0,0,erikpukinskis,,,"Poverty is hard to solve, but it&#x27;s becoming easy to solve very quickly. Let&#x27;s assume for a minute we have all the money in the world. Poverty is easily solved by removing the obstacles that are preventing the poor from being self-sufficient. But what are those obstacles? Poverty is not considered a disorder yet, and we do not have good diagnostic tools for diagnosing those obstacles.<p>Let&#x27;s think for a second about how it if you are wealthy. If your family has enough money, you can have access to 24-hour care for much of your development, either from a stay-at-home parent or a nanny. In other words, you have a person whose full-time job is removing those obstacles and training you to detect and remove them on your own. Not everyone&#x27;s parents actually do that well, but they at least had a shot at it.<p>That&#x27;s great, but it&#x27;s not useful to us for fixing poverty because it&#x27;s too expensive to scale. We can&#x27;t assign a full-time nanny to everyone in poverty, it&#x27;d be in the trillions of dollars.<p>But I think the internet changes the economics of this substantially.<p>For every one of those specific obstacles that is THE big blocker in a poor person&#x27;s life, there is someone somewhere else in the world, who has either been there before, or seen it a million times, and who knows exactly what are the main tools you need in your toolbag if you are going to make it through that kind of situation. If we had that all of those equipment lists in a giant database for all of the world&#x27;s poor, we wouldn&#x27;t need a full-time nanny, we could just equip the poor person with some tools, and they would have a good shot at leveling up. Tools like I&#x27;m describing would be orders of magnitude cheaper than a full time nanny.<p>So there&#x27;s a chunk of work for someone: How do you connect poor people with other people who have seen people get through their specific bottleneck?<p>Of course then they&#x27;ll need some supplies and probably some ongoing hourly work by whatever relevant professionals are needed. And obviously you are paying rent and health insurance and all of that until those things become self sufficienct.<p>I think good information tools could bring the cost of this down from trillions to billions.<p>Still a lot of money, how could we make it back?<p>By bringing people out of poverty you basically get first crack at marketing to a totally new market. You could also make recruiting deals. I think as long as you&#x27;re transparent about what is advertising and what is advice, it&#x27;s morally OK to do this. Although I would love to hear other ideas about that. I am not attached to the model.<p>All of these transitions I&#x27;m talking about facilitating are going to have very high variability, which makes this also a very difficult endeavor to fund or insure. But if you can get all of the tools as efficient as possible, I think a relatively small amount of capital might be able to bootstrap the process. You just have to get your scale to something above the stochastic noise in the outcomes for individual clients.<p>Once it was bootstrapped though, you could just fund it with VC.",1443224441

Several years back, on a single quad-core machine with 1 disk, I was able to handle 5TB (several billion messages) of signalling data per day - indexing, archiving, searching. I&#x27;m nothing amazing. (I went to SF thinking I could somehow turn this indexing system into amazing profit. First guy I showed says &quot;oh yeah I recognize this, go get <some intro db textbook>&quot;. Oops, so much for breakthrough ideas.)<p>A team of me-equivalents (with some that _have_ gone to school) and a nice budget could end up designing something like these spy systems. They aren&#x27;t the Manhattan Project requiring new knowledge no one in the world has. I&#x27;m no 3-sigma intellect. There are dozens of millions of people more intelligent than me. Complaining about it and shaming engineers will not work against such critical projects.",1443222149

Estimates suggest over 50% of IoT devices in the home are susceptible to RCE, but vendors still do not issue patches because no one is forcing them. Underground video channels exist where you can spy on people through the enormous collection of cameras embedded on devices like toasters, light bulbs, doorbells, etc.<p>Cyberwar (ugh, that term) has become white hot after a nuclear reactor meltdown in Russia where every adversary blames each other and America blames Russia for a false flag operation. Packets are now blocked from entering/exiting entire countries unless you have a special permit. Like  with radio/tv in Cold War I, everyone begins suspecting spies and government malware in their computers. People increasingly huddle for safety in walled gardens like Facebook, rarely venturing out to unknown sites.<p>Node/js experiences a huge exodus of maturing developers seeking a more professional, rigorous language, leaving behind massive codebases of poorly-written and completely undocumented code and over 3 million node package libraries with varying dependency issues. Javascript has become so popular worldwide that Americans barely make mimimum wage coding in it.<p>Ethereum still struggles to find any devs who can understand how the fuck their entire platform is supposed to work despite an additional white paper being published.<p>Microsoft admits no one wants a windows phone and retreats from the mobile market, dooming themselves to simply dominating the dismal &quot;legacy&quot; desktop world only inhabited by developers, people too poor to afford a mobile phone, enterprise customers, and call support centers. Open Sourcing .Net winds up causing large amounts of developers to learn Linux, and they develop a taste for it.

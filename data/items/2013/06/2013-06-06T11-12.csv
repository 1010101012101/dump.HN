5831809,comment,5830633,5830963,5,0,king_jester,,,"> I hate to use this tone but, so be it. Maybe now you morons who continue to vote in the pieces of shit into our government who are bent on taking more and more power for themselves will wake up and figure it out? How much more proof do you need? Does this make you angry yet or is Obama still your diety? Oh, and Republicans don't get a pass either.<p>> The point is that all of you morons voting like robots along party lines are destroying my country, from the inside, one fucking vote at a time. And it is sad. And it is painful. And it is almost unbearable to watch. You are destroying what this country is supposed to be about and turning it into something our children will have to suffer with.<p>I'm sorry but this is a load of crap. The US gov't at all levels has always suffered from this problem due to the way it is structured. Blaming individual people for not participating in that system the way you think they should is completely unhelpful and puts the blame in the wrong place.<p>> Terrorists won. You morons saw to it. Our way of life is, in many ways, unrecognizable from what it was before 9/11.<p>This is not true. Although some policies and attitudes have changed since 9/11, US society has not fundamentally changed and the major problems pre-9/11 are the same post-9/11.<p>> When are you going to understand that a conservative Libertarian (as opposed to extreme and nearly anarchist) approach is the only path to recovery? Ultra limited government. They are OUR servants, we are not their property. They need to get the fuck out of our lives, homes, businesses, bedrooms, schools and more.<p>I find it funny that you slight anarchism here while claiming that a different type of political candidate is all that is needed to change society. Limited government isn't just about reduced budgets and programs, but removing the bureaucratic and hierarchical elements of government. Further, if you feel that existing political parties all are contributing to the problem, picking a different party isn't going to change anything.<p>> Time to take it back. Peacefully. Vote with intelligence. Email. Write letters. Make calls. Let them know who they work for. Reboot the system.<p>This isn't rebooting the system, this is how most people interact with and solicit the government already.",1370519807

5831804,comment,5830604,5830961,5,0,derefr,,,"Well, yes, that's basically the converse of the Principle of Charity (let's call it here the Principle of Political Doublespeak): in est, when a politician makes a promise, what they're actually promising is to temper all the decisions which <i>they themselves</i> are presented with or hold sway over through that promise. For example, a promise to make the sky blue is really a promise on what color to paint the exteriors of all outgoing NASA satellite missions.<p>The only reason this is allowed is that everyone involved in the promise--the speaker and the lobbyists and the corporate executives and the military generals and the foreign policy analysts, and congress and the senate, too[1]--all share an understanding that all promises requiring certain attitudes from other parties the executive must work with--at least within a non-dictatorship--are empty, so no one is actually confused as to whether they will be fulfilled (they won't.) Thus, the stances behind them become a means of signalling, showing that one stands for the views of one's base even if one can do practically nothing ""within the system"" to advance the proposed agenda.<p>[1] Note that ""the voters"" aren't part of this list. This is one of the effects of truly <i>representative</i> democracy: there is no incentive for political language to be informative to anyone who doesn't have a say in ""how the sausage is made.""",1370519782

So we compete on cheaper things like nice offices, gym memberships, etc. Basically, feel good stuff that doesn't cost much.<p>Facebook's budget for engineers is a good 20-50% higher than the salary a startup can pay.<p>Thus, it's not actually crazy that a law school student can become an engineer worth $80,000/year in only eight months. It's the startup's only option.<p>And that's a good thing: Companies like ours (<a href=""http://www.thinkful.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkful.com/</a>) are finding a way to build products in a way that doesn't break our budget. We're also providing great opportunities to people who want to become engineers. The only caveat is for companies greater than 50 or so people they're struggling most of all: Too small to attract great talent that wants stability, too large to attract hungry new talent or accept junior talent that needs to learn on the job.<p>There's an upper limit, but our research indicates that there's a durable demand for engineering.

Thought I would drop you some initial points from my first use.<p>I know London areas reasonably well by name but less so geographically. I guess seasoned commuters would, but not someone new to living in London. I had to keep hovering over the red neighbourhood icons to get the name up. It would be good if each neighbourhood icon was the initial or first letters. That way I'd know MV was Maida Vale, CT would be Camden Town. You will have repeating letters (Kensington, Knightsbridge) but it would make it a lot easier to naturally gravitate to roughly the right area.<p>When you click on the icons, some of the longer names force the words 'to search' to be orphaned onto the next line of the button. (Whitechapel/Brick Lane & Bethnal Green are two examples) You could take the words 'to search' off.<p>Also there could be a button for 'Add All' - then folks could filter on commute time at the end. That would really highlight the cost savings by getting people to expand their search. It would be a no brainer if you were considering two flats at 600 & 700 - probably served by the same tube stop, same commute - just a few streets apart. Opening people up to new locations could be really helpful!<p>Also, when I went through to the results page. They were neither ordered by price or by commute.

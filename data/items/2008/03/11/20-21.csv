134618,comment,134464,134599,0,0,PStamatiou,,,"Am I wrong to assume that in the chatterous web chat, everyone in the group receives the updates by default, either be it SMS etc? I don't want to use it too much if I feel like people will get annoyed by getting my every update.<p>To me it seems like reinventing the wheel for chat in this case. Yes, chatterous is great for getting a group of friends together to plan something like a dinner and have all the updates go out to everyone.. but for a regular web chat I don't see how this is any better than IRC.",1205268951

While some (most ?) people don't care about this sort of thing and tend to take devs' word for it, the model needs to be disclosed to allow independent review and evaluation.

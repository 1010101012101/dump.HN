I have experience in construction. I have never been in a situation where it would be easier to mash in a screw with a hammer than use a drill. In fact, I have tried to do that before and it's <i>extremely</i> hard.<p>It is also not necessary to drill a pilot hole when drilling normal wood screws into typical construction pine or plywood.<p>You drill pilot holes in hardwood, because otherwise the screw is hard to drill and because there is a risk that the wood might split. In those cases, you would want to drill a pilot hole before putting a similarly sized nail in too.",1258415979

I forget who told me this, but the US Patent and Trademark Office in DC hires engineers for their engineering disciplines' patent examiner FTE slots.  The argument goes that it's easier to take an engineer and give them a smattering of law education than it is to take a lawyer and give them a smattering of engineering education and expect them to understand the utility of a new engineering application or detect whether or not it is novel because they don't understand the technology enough to see what's similar to it.<p>However, as the article demonstrates, a piece-wise comparison of A/B where A is what you've trained for and B is being an educator, A wins for pay in just about every field.  B is always a step down in pretty much whatever metric you look at, aside from developing future generations.

That just dilutes and compromises both your work and the remainder of your life. A startup is a chance to balance out your work and life over many decades. If you can work, say, five times as effectively as other people (which is hard), and if you can get paid for that, you have the possibility to compress your working life into 9 years instead of 45 years--that will give you an extra 36 years with no work commitments at all, free to travel and choose your own interests. Balance in this form can make up for a lot of all-nighters during the startup.",1258412769

It would make sense that EMR's, like the Internet, and PC's before it, will be adopted collectively as a generation.<p>I've personally been involved in a reasonably large deployment of a high-profile EMR system. In my case, we're talking about introducing networked software systems to <i>an entire workforce</i>. Doctors. Nurses. Residents. Receptionists. These aren't even people in the corporate business world, where computer / internet skills are considered vital skills. We're talking about starting from the ground up, ""This is how you log into your computer"". Even once they've been trained, it's not the same as having staff full of tech-savvy employees, who intuitively know how they can make software work for them.<p>EMR's have a long way to go as well. many of the packages out pretty much just  duplicate the functionality of paper records as pages of forms. The only difference is that the info is displayed it on a screen. Additionally, Presumably in an attempt to lock up a young market, there doesn't seem to be a lot of horizontal integration going on yet. This too will change, I think, as the market demands more as they become more widely adopted.<p>On a side note, you have <i>no</i> idea how old-school many med-school programs are.

945538,comment,944959,944959,0,0,hristov,,,"As somebody that does alpine skiing and is a great fan of the sport, I feel I should elaborate on that analogy. You see the coach was talking about practice. And yes in practice you should be pushing yourself and risking a fall.<p>There is a tradeoff between speed and risk in slalom. The faster you go the more likely it is to fall or miss a gate. But skill goes into it too. A more skilled skier will be able to go faster without making any mistakes. And how do you get skills? Well you practice. That's why you should practice at speeds that tend to cause you to fall. Because as you keep falling your skills at that speed increase and eventually you will fall less and less until you stop falling and you are able to ski reliably at the higher speed. If you practice at comfortable speeds, you will not gain the skills to deal with higher speeds. But all of this is true because it is training and in training the cost of a fall is more or less nothing (again we are talking about slalom here, not downhill where one fall can easily kill you).<p>Of course when you start racing things get different. One fall or missed gate usually disqualifies you from a race. Also, a single race includes two runs down the hill. Thus, one could race brilliantly for most of the day and fall in the end of the second run and become disqualified. A world cup run involves many races around the world, wherein each skiier earns points for each race and the points are added up in the end of the year to determine the gold medalist.<p>So an elite skier can afford to ski relatively safe in order to get consistent results over the many races. What you actually see in slalom is that many of the top skiers do not ski as fast as they are capable during the year. They want to control their risk. It is the younger and less known skiers that try to ski as fast as they can, because they figure if they play it safe they will probably finish behind the experienced guys, but if they risk it all they might get first place and make a name for themselves.<p>So the lesson of embracing risk works only during practice and not always during the race.<p>What life or business lessons one can gain from this? I don't know I just felt like talking about skiing. But hey I have one, maybe if you are a startup founder you should be like a young and inexperienced skiier and risk it all, because if you play it safe you will always get beaten by a big company playing it safe.",1258412675

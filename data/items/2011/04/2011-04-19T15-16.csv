Right - so that's definitely not a long-term business model for sustaining higher prices. Rogues might get away with short term manipulation, but if you were doing that and working for a firm, there's a fair chance they'd be locked up.<p><pre><code>    > Here is a jumping off point [1].

Basically, what he said is that if you can't trust your VCS to have the code in it that it should (and verifiable via hashes), then that is everything. I agree.<p>The Subversion Team, who are all great people and _really_ smart, made a huge mistake with adding mergeinfo to 1.5. It is a trainwreck of pretending to be able to do merges reliably, but in reality, it plain doesn't work. I talk about two specific cases where it breaks down in my posting, but there are many more.<p>Subversion has a lot going for it, I just think that the mergeinfo feature should just be thrown out and reworked from the ground up.

Phenomena such as the rapid changes in fossil morphology puzzled biologists for much of the second half of the 20th century, but the latest research is suggesting that this is indeed a real effect, and not due to the spotty nature of the fossil record.  In the lab, in simulations, and in the real world, we see populations change rapidly in the face of a rapidly changing environment.  Don't believe me?  Think how quickly the common cold has to mutate to remain viable when faced with the highly adaptive human immune system.  Or how about how quickly MRSA has developed.  Or how quickly we can change the appearance of a dog breed with selective breeding.<p>Going back to the reefs, if you have a population with millions of individual organisms of each species spread over a large area, it is not unreasonable, due to genetic drift, to expect some of those organisms to already have a few tricks up their sleeve to handle increased acidity.  Some will have trick 1, some will have trick 2 etc etc.  As the acidity starts to rise, these organisms will have the better success at passing the genes onto their offspring.  Those offspring have a good chance of inheriting different tricks from their other parent, making them even better at surviving in the acidified environment.  So it goes, the greatest show on earth.<p>The tl;dr version is that the mutations don't have to all hit at once - there will be many mutations already latent in the population due to genetic drift that will help make adapting much faster and easier.<p>Still want to tell me that I don't understand the nature of mutations?",1303228426

I think libertarians assume that the bitcoin network will be full of other libertarians.  The article is right that the network may also be full of big entities whose behavior is regulated.  Whatever your feelings about regulation, this would seem to make bitcoin less interesting.<p>I think one option is to accept that the bitcoin protocol will be forked massively and design it from the ground up to support exchanges between various versions of the protocol.  That way, libertarians could avoid versions with inflationary policies.  In this setup, would there be any reason for an entity to choose an inflatable flavor of bitcoin?  Perhaps certain businesses and banks would be coerced to through regulation and that would create more widespread demand for those forks.  It seems possible that most users would use the regulated bitcoins and the libertarian version might become a black-market currency.<p>All this feels not too different from the current situation where you can invest in gold or leave your money in a fiat currency.  I guess the main difference is that the ""gold"" (i.e., the non-inflating bitcoin forks) might be less traceable and more liquid than true gold is today.  I'm beginning to suspect that, while bitcoin is a damned-cool technical idea, it isn't likely to massively change the world other than, perhaps, to grease the wheels of black-market transactions.",1303227090

I speak and read Chinese and have lived in various parts of the Chinese-speaking world. I have Chinese-language textbooks of mathematics at home from more than one country.

They are using 100 billion watts/m^2. That is, you would need to concentrate sunlight to 100 million times to reach this level.[2]<p>Put another way, if your fiber is about 1mm in diameter, you will need a perfect[3] mirror array 10 meters in diameter to drive it[4]. [CORRECTED from 400 meters, thanks to <i>loup-vaillant</i>]<p>Wild speculation follows:<p> This has got to be used in pulsed mode. 100 kilowatts down a 1mm optical fiber is going to vaporize it if done for more than a tiny fraction of a second. Are there the optical equivalent of super conductors that are suitable for this?<p> I went with a 1mm fiber because it ""only"" required a 10m mirror to drive it, but at what voltage are we going to get 100 kilowatts of power out of a non-conductor with a 1mm^2 cross section? Sounds like 50 zillion is the answer.<p>Lets guess 10% efficiency, and the rest comes out as light at the end of the fiber (so our fiber doesn't turn to plasma). Where are you going to point that? I suppose into a light tight chamber contained in the molten salt loop of a steam power plant would be a good start.<p> Maybe this all works better at the nano scale. Heat dissipation is easier since essentially all of the optical media can be in contact with heat sink. The mirrors get smaller to achieve the required light density. There is a shape, sort of stretched parabolic looking, that is a non-imaging optical funnel which <i>might</i> get your light all gathered to the same point, albeit going in a variety of direction. The total power would be lower, lowering the voltage required, letting you use sane power converters.<p>[1] And yet again, you have degraded the value of my undergraduate education by falsifying my hard learned facts.<p>[2] I may well have lost a zero or more each way. It's early. Don't use these calculations to place orders for mirrors.<p>[3] From 10+ meters away it is going to have to focus to a 1mm target. [CORRECTED from 200+, it doesn't sound <i>so</i> bad now]<p>[4] On proofreading I see I have a [4] footnote, in the text but no corresponding note.

I've done that, just not the first job.<p>I've quit every job I've ever had.  Six were without written notice, though they were prefaced with talks with managers over several months indicating that I wasn't happy and why -- so I don't think in any situation it ever came as a surprise.  In no instance did I ever have another job lined up. This is because I knew exactly what I wanted in a change, so I was ready to act on it.<p>Reading further down in the thread, it seems that you're not working on things you like.  Tell a manager this, tell them what you'd like to work on, and see if there's opportunity within the company to do that, or if they're willing to make that happen.<p>Your feeling of ""atrophy"" seems to be that you're falling behind current trends.  This happens in most organizations. Don't let anyone - even here - tell you otherwise. Places working with newer technologies that are better tailored to specific needs are in the minority due to politics, shortsightedness and a myriad of other reasons. The only way around this is to find these organizations that are absolutely exceptions -- The places that want to always use the best tool for the job, even if they have to spend the time to evaluate the new tools and learn it up front.  Cardboard Box Co., BigOl Wholesaler Inc., or J. Random Fund-of-Funds are rarely those kinds of organizations. Why? No one wants to put their neck on the line politically in case they made a mistake. People are too busy looking out for themselves rather than the organization as a whole.<p>You will probably need to change jobs, but see if the current employer is willing to make things work for you. If no, it's a matter of when. I'd say at least come up with a big list of places you're going to apply to if you're going to quit. And if you've come up with the list, start applying.<p>Unless you want something else. Regardless, you're not going to act until you know what you want. So figure that out, and then you'll find you make progress rather quickly.",1303225467

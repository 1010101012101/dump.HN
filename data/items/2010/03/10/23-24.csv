1182386,comment,1181742,1182149,0,0,sreque,,,"Can your emacs editor construct hyperlinked call graphs showing all callers and callees of a given function? Will this call graph generation remain up to date as I edit files?<p>Can Emacs give me a hyper-linked list of all usages of a given symbol and do it properly(lexical scope, etc.), not just doing a simple symbol search?<p>Can I edit my code in emacs, have a background compiler compile the file on the fly, and also provide error feedback, hilighting the  problem lines with a tagged failure reason and also providing a hyper-linked list in another window as well? Last I checked, the best I could do would be to kick off a compile manually and navigate the errors as a linked list.<p>How's emacs' refactoring support? Judging by the following stackoverflow post, it's pretty poor: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/673554/how-can-i-refactor-c-source-code-using-emacs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/673554/how-can-i-refactor...</a>.<p>How's Emacs' keyword completion? Last I checked, it was just a hacky dictionary look-up, whereas an IDE can semantically analyze the source to provide intelligent suggestions.<p>Even if you can get Vim or Emacs to do some of the above, it usually isn't as easy to use or as useful as an IDE. For instance, I know you can get call graph support in Vim using cctree.vim, but it relies on cscope, which requires refreshing the database manually, is slow to load, and tends to generate incomplete tag sets.<p>IDE's are, well, better integrated, and so can do many things a lot better than looser environments like Emacs and Vim. Their UI's tend to be a lot more powerful because they are not designed to be run on windowless environments. Personally, for small projects I use Vim and for large projects I use an IDE with a Vim emulation plugin like Netbean's JVI plugin.",1268265598

1182370,comment,1181157,1181157,0,0,prawn,,,"Last year, I was approached by two Dutch trainees (20 and 22 yo) who wanted to do their trainee placement abroad. I agreed without having done more than trade a handful of emails with them.<p>They came to Australia and worked for me for five months. They brought their own laptops so I only had to provide a couple of desks, second monitor for each and a chair. I paid them in accordance with a typical traineeship for them back home (about AUD150/week, which would be around USD135/week). Their rent (at the place of a friend of mine) was AUD100/week and they supplemented their living costs with savings and help from their parents.<p>They were pretty raw as web designers and HTML/CSS guys but got a lot of opportunities to learn new skills and fill gaps with simpler work. Generally, they had paid for themselves each week by the end of each Monday. They loved the experience (we do drink beer and play a lot of table tennis here at the office!) and it worked really well for me also.<p>I am a general web studio first and foremost but was able to use them on various side projects as well - cutting PSDs to HTML, doing logo and page concepts, general maintenance, etc.<p>Their supervisor is looking to send more over later this year - they have intakes (outtakes?) in February and September. Will definitely be doing it again.<p>Worth echoing caryme's comment about designing intern projects in advance. With a sudden boost in manpower to a small business (I'm a sole director with two employees normally) you can quickly burn through work and have time to kill. In those times, it's good to have a few side projects you've been meaning to start. As a sole founder, try not to leave yourself as the chokepoint if you can avoid it.<p>Happy to answer any questions about it if people are interested.",1268265004

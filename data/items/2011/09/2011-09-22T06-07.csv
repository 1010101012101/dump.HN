When a user does an action, I add him via the MailChimp API to the right group. (Can the same contact be in different groups?)<p>But then I stumbled upon this article: <a href=""http://blog.mailchimp.com/autoresponder-triggers-in-mailchimp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.mailchimp.com/autoresponder-triggers-in-mailchim...</a><p>""Some users have told us, I dont want to send autoresponders based on subscription to a list.

3025076,comment,3022479,3024548,0,0,kragen,,,"> ""an open-source code model"" (it even has the hyphen in the right place!)<p>I think in that case both ""open-source"" and ""code"" are modifying ""model"", so it's still not the same thing.<p>> And 1997 has a discussion about whether ""open source cryptography"" is better than ""proprietary  cryptography"" (and in which ""published"" is used as a synonym for ""open source"").<p>That's from the spook community, which uses ""open source"" to mean ""publicly known information"", and they're talking about cryptosystems, not source code.<p>> The word ""source"" is short for ""source code."" They aren't exactly distinct things, so that is really splitting hairs.<p>Someone could have potentially used the word ""source"" as short for ""source code"" in the phrase ""open source"" before Chris Peterson did in that meeting, but I haven't found any cases of that happening.  Not a single one.<p>The whole point is that the phrase ""open source"" now has a specific meaning not derivable from the meanings of its component words, much like ""source code"", ""pro-choice"", or ""death row"".  If a Congressperson declares that they're ""pro-choice"" but votes to amend the Constitution to prohibit abortion, or someone claimed that they were fulfilling their contractual obligation to provide you with ""source code"" by giving you the SKUs they use to order office supplies, you'd be justifiably angry at the deception.  If you find a quote from someone in 1958 using the term ""pro-free-choice"" to mean ""opposed to racial segregation"", it does not make any less dishonest a hypothetical use of the term ""pro-choice"" with that meaning today.",1316672511

3025074,comment,3023132,3023493,1,0,drgath,,,"> In order for monopoly power to exist, there have to be barriers preventing users from switching search providers.<p>That is incorrect. A ""monopoly"" is simply having a large enough control over the market that you dictate how others access that market.  Monopolies are not illegal.  Google does have a monopoly on search, Schmidt admitted that much today by saying they are ""in the area"" of having one.<p>Abusing your monopoly power is however illegal, and that's what Google is being investigated for.",1316672448

An excerpt from the original project README:<p><i>This is Hubot, a Campfire chat bot in node.js.</i><p><i>The goal is to make common systems stuff seem less like black magic by turning frequently performed manual processes into simple commands and making those interactions visible to the team via Campfire. Benefits:</i><p><i> Fast access to server logs and machine information when something goes wrong.</i><p><i> Everyone sees how common tasks are performed.</i><p><i> Interactions are logged and available in campfire transcripts.</i><p><i> Let's us do stuff from the phone with Ember when AFK.</i><p><i> Can paste squirrel pics and stuff like that.</i><p>For new people starting at GitHub, they can kind of just lurk in the chat room for a couple days to get a feel for how most types of things are done because people are issuing Hubot commands all the time.<p>It's really powerful.

Although Google had previously acknowledged that it needed a license to use Yelps content, it was now using it without permission to prop up its own, less effective product. In some instances, Google even presented this content to its users as if it were its own. [See Exhibit C]<p>Googles Offers a False Choice<p>In response to our objections, Google informed us that it would cease the practice only if we agreed to be removed from Googles web search index, thereby preventing Yelp from appearing anywhere in Google web search results. This, of course, was a false choice. Googles dominant position in the market prevents services like Yelp from exercising any sort of meaningful choice in the matter: it is a choice between allowing Google to co-opt ones content and not competing at all.""",1316671788

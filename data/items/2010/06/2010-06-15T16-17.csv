(The sun has risen thousands of times in my personal experience, and bazillions of times in the experience of humans, while only a handful of fundamental physics discoveries have been made.)  In either case, it's a question of justifying the claim that ""In situations of type A, X has always been true in the past.  Therefore, in situations of type A in the future, X will be true"".<p>Likewise your simple statement that ""the current zoo of particles may well all be fundamental, with no 'simpler' theory underlying them."" is analogous to ""the sun will collapse into a black hole tomorrow"".  Again, just a difference of degree.<p>[I should stress here that the justification for empiricism is an age-old philosophical problem which isn't easy to understand, much less solve.  However, I think that a proper understanding of the history of physics gives very convincing (though maybe not the-sun-will-rise convincing) evidence that simplicity and beauty will be found at the bottom of the particle zoo.]<p>I don't understand what the true statement<p>>If there really is to be a scientific breakthrough of the magnitude of a Newton, it seems likely (almost by definition) that it will be from an unexpected avenue of thought - seeing that the expected ones have been well researched and haven't been all that productive.<p>has to do with our current discussion.<p>Lastly, (basically) no career particle physicist think that any Nobel prizes will be awarded for a unifying theory in their lifetime.

If there really is to be a scientific breakthrough of the magnitude of a Newton, it seems likely (almost by definition) that it will be from an unexpected avenue of thought - seeing that the expected ones have been well researched and haven't been all that productive.<p>I guess it makes sense to bet on a unifying theory if you are a career particle physicist.

A little customer feedback could shave off a lot of effort.<p>Also, more features don't always make for a better product (witness: Apple vs. Google or Microsoft).  Judicious feature-cutting both saves development effort and tends to make the UI simpler and easier to use.",1333511923

As imperfect as my grammar and spelling are, I know that when I have a stack of resumes on my desk to review, the first pass weeds out the ones with grammar/spelling mistakes. Applying for a job is too important of a task to make avoidable mistakes like that. If you have not taken the time to make your resume perfect then you are likely to do sloppy work in your day to day activities. I would apply the same filter to a YC application. If I ever find myself working up an application for YC, I would spend the time and money needed to make sure every bit of that was correct. Now whether it should be formal or informal or what have you would be a big mystery. I would tend to lean toward formal in something like that. But perhaps not so formal that I come off has a robot.

A company that is already the top natural result for its own name may still find it profitable or necessary to be the top paid result as well, to catch that traffic.<p>In some e-commerce contexts, even if the top natural result is the <i>direct source</i> of a certain product, selling at the <i>best price</i>, a significant amount of traffic will go to a <i>reseller</i> who has <i>higher-prices</i>, but appears in the first paid position.<p>For those categories, Google and the reseller are a tag-team distribution-power middleman siphoning value from both the searcher and the target site, compared to the 'platonic ideal' of just giving the searcher what they want.

We decided to get a decent demo of our product, wrote to 15-20 YC alumni to try and get some feedback. About 8 replied back and from those we got one to write a recommendation to the YC crew. We still don't know if that helped or not but we ended up getting an interview with the partners (who showed some interest in our idea). We totally blew the pre-interview talk with Harj on Skype.<p>Sadly, we were told that due to legal issues they had decided not to fund us (and we had to close shop a couple of months later due to these specific problems).

3796087,comment,3794934,3794987,9,0,tedunangst,,,"My experience working with compiler like products is that susceptibility to crashes is related to choice of data structure for AST/IR.  If you allow ""weird"" stuff in your AST, some component won't handle it well and crash.  If your AST is strongly typed (but less flexible) this is less of a problem.<p>As a concrete example, EDG (used by ICC) has a strongly typed AST.  GCC's AST consists of a single type (tree), which allows you to build absurd trees.  You could represent the equivalent of<p><pre><code>    int x = goto struct { while (1); }
</code></pre>
because the data type doesn't prohibit a goto target that happens to be a struct.  This will probably explode when it gets to some later compiler stage.  If you have distinct goto_node and label_node types, the compiler is less likely to accidentally create such monstrosities.  You don't usually get such trees directly from the parser, but from some middle transformation pass.",1333510508

This mostly works, but if you have a bunch of cases (data points in multidimensional space), simple interpolation isn't always accurate. You need to look at the specifics of the present case (there's still uncertainty because each judge has an individual perspective, but that's a different issue).
It's a little bit like a fractal: just knowing some data points won't always  predict - even roughly - what happens in between (but in flatter regions, it can).
And Turing showed that (in general), you can't predict the result of a computation except by actually doing it.<p>The <i>experience</i> the article mentions only helps when a specific domain reoccurs, and known tools have been developed for it, with known characteristics. Now, if you know that domain and the tools, you can do prediction pretty well. I think of it like an experienced tradesman.<p>However, when you go into a new area (and a new one is created every decade or so in programming), you're back to zero in many respects. e.g. the existence of the right library can save 10,000 hours.",1333509537

If Barbara isn't pregnant or planning to become pregnant, and has taken steps to prevent pregnancy, she is still a better hire than Alice, all things being equal. In a competitive market for labor under complete freedom of contract, a company could ask both Alice and Barbara about their plans to become a mother. The employment contract could also include clauses contingent on pregnancy, such as indemnifying the company against the lost productivity caused by unexpected maternity leave. The details would be determined by the relative bargaining power of the company and prospective employee. Those offended by such practices could simply decline to apply to such companies.<p>In short, under freedom of contract, company policies with respect to pregnancy would depend on free negotiations between buyers (employers) and sellers (applicants).

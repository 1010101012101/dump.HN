One of my greatest programming feats what with CodeCenter/ObjectCenter, an interpretive environment for C/C++, where I ported a scanner driver and rewrote the engine for monster Kodak document imaging scanners in 3 weeks.  The very first time I hooked up one of these 600 pound, bigger than a washing machine scanners and hit the &quot;Go&quot; button it worked all the way through to writing files.<p>Well, until I ran out of file descriptors, forgot a close() ^_^.  But I found being able to do that rather impressive, granted, I&#x27;d been working on the lower level SCSI code for a couple of years with optical drives and scanners.",1442059195

The service has stagnated over the years. Reading snippets is such a frustrating experience (you cannot even cut and paste the text). Even the books where one can buy an ebook is not available for some countries.

It&#x27;s not because you can&#x27;t just &quot;say it&quot; that you go to symbolism, it&#x27;s because the thing, said straight, doesn&#x27;t really capture what you want to say.<p>E.g. &quot;life is beautiful in a sad way&quot; -- that&#x27;s the clear message.

But at the same time I .. how to say that, don&#x27;t want syntax. First lisps had the minimum of it: sexp, symbol. jmc lisp stopped there, they then added numbers and strings for ergonomic sanity[1], and it feels the right balance, the proximity of metalevel and language, the adt/dsl feel since everything will be an sexp based abstraction (SICP ate my mind?).<p>So clojure tried principled consistency, I like the logic of it, but not the result. Erik Meijer and Brett Victor claim it&#x27;s a good thing to do. Find a concept and go all the way down with it.<p>[1] it would be fun to be denotational even for these.

10207810,comment,10204255,10204756,0,0,vidarh,,,"There&#x27;s an anecdote, that I&#x27;ve been unable to verify, about an interview with a famous Norwegian writer (well, famouns <i>in</i> Norway) where the interviewer - a literature critic - went on and on about the symbolism of a scene in one of the authors books where some women are washing some clothes. Really ripping the scene to shreds word for words and assigning all kinds of meanings to every little choice. And then he asked the author for confirmation, basically.<p>Whereupon said author thought about it for a bit and told the interviewer something to the effect that he thought that was fantastic, and wish he&#x27;d thought of all of those things, but he&#x27;d just thought the image was nice.<p>When at school I got exasperated by the same thing, as I wrote a lot of poetry at that age, and for me it was all about the imagery and emotions it evoked. Anyone who&#x27;d tried to analyse symbolism in any of what I wrote would have already missed the point. You might <i>find</i> something in there, but it would not have been &quot;mine&quot;. And generally I feel that while you may pick up on some interesting things now and again, you also lose a lot when you start picking everything apart. Analysis got close to killing my interest in literature.<p>The one time I wrote something intentionally full of symbols, it was a sarcastic response to analysis, with a very clear message to my Norwegian teacher about what I thought about analysing poems. He didn&#x27;t appreciate it (the rest of my class did, though - it&#x27;s the only time anyone applauded a poem in any of my classes..)<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean that there aren&#x27;t authors that delight in putting symbolism into their works, or who does it subconsciously, of course, but to me it greatly reduces my pleasure in reading to look for it.",1442056739

Clojure is philosophically a Lisp, but as others have pointed out, it isn&#x27;t usefully the same language as any other Lisp that preceded it or exists today. If this particular example is useful to people who might otherwise think they could reuse existing Lisp code, then I suppose it&#x27;s saved some effort, but that just seems like a straw man.<p>Either way, if you get the terminal condition of a recursive function wrong, you will blow the stack. It&#x27;s true Clojure isn&#x27;t built to do TCO, but that&#x27;s a non-sequitur. The idea that you don&#x27;t typically use recursion in Clojure is ridiculous - for is a macro, it&#x27;s syntactic sugar over Clojure&#x27;s recursion primitives, loop and recur. Even if you didn&#x27;t want to use that, change the nil? check to empty? and it works. I&#x27;m not going to claim that Clojure&#x27;s list/sequence semantics are necessarily the cleanest (the empty _sequence_ in Clojure is nil, an empty list/vector/set etc is not), but they&#x27;re not hard to learn if you make any effort at all. Again, your existing Lisp experience may or may not help you understand Clojure&#x27;s data structures, but I am surprised that this is a surprise to anybody.",1442055786

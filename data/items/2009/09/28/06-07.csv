Open Source advocates have always claimed the money (and the later introduction to Baystar which led to more funding) was to destroy Linux but if Microsoft had wanted to do that they could have easily bought out SCO and just asserted the patents themselves.<p>Point #2 (Linux is a Cancer): Ballmer made this quote in 2001 when referring to the GNU GPL.  Put in context it isn't the smoking gun Open Software advocates represent it as.  From the Register's article regarding the quote (<a href=""http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_c...</a>)...<p>Microsoft CEO and incontinent over-stater of facts Steve Ballmer said that ""Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches,"" during a commercial spot masquerading as a media interview with the Chicago Sun-Times Friday.<p>Ballmer was trying to articulate his concern, whether real or imagined, that limited recourse to the GNU GPL requires that all software be made open source.<p>""The way the license is written, if you use any open-source software, you have to make the rest of your software open source,"" Ballmer explained to an excessively credulous, un-named Sun-Times reporter who, predictably, neglected to question this bold assertion.",1254119843

847941,comment,847459,847785,0,0,andreyf,,,"FWIW, wikipedia defines censorship as ""the suppression of speech or deletion of communicative material which may be considered objectionable, harmful, sensitive, or inconvenient to the government or media organizations as determined by a censor"". By that definition, just as Apple censors pornography from their app store, they seem to be censoring ""politically charged"" applications, as well.<p>So while it's (as far as I know) legal for Apple to decline ""politically charged"" applications, just as it would be legal for them to decline applications made by Jews, I don't think it's morally justifiable. While I agree with the cause of single-payer health insurance, I would be just as upset if Apple rejected the Druge Reader or Fox News app for being ""politically charged"".<p>Just as common carriers cannot discriminate against their users, once Apple provides a channel for businesses or people to sell things to customers, their power to decide what goes or doesn't go thought that channel should be limited.",1254119243

Then you take the mean and variance of the prior for p, or two ends of a confidence interval for p, and use them to find the alpha and beta parameters for the Beta distribution.

And once lost, it isn't coming back.<p>To give more detail, they were looking at an important protein which appears in many species.  Since they know the protein for many modern species, and they know when different species branched off, they can reconstruct the likely form of the protein at each branching.  Given modern computer modeling, they can figure out what each version of the protein will do.  They demonstrated that it used to respond to 2 hormones.  40 million years later it responded to only 1 of those.  They identified the responsible mutation and found that random mutations that happened after the first would cause it to respond to nothing if you undid the mutation.<p>In short, a significant mutation opens the door for further mutations that make the first irreversible.",1254118634

He was discussing the decision ""You have a pristine prairie next to a Wal-Mart.  Wal-Mart wants to pave it to make it a parking lot.  What are the pros and cons of this?""<p>Someone pointed out that, if you turn it into a parking lot, you can never get the prairie back, but if it turns out you really need the parking lot you can make that transformation at a later date.  My teacher said ""Ah, but after it is Tuesday, you will <i>forever lose</i> the use of the parking lot on Monday if you haven't already built it.  You can't ever get that day back.""<p>This concept is widely applicable -- for example, many pro-life folks say the death penalty is irreversible and that this is a strike against it.  I happen to be pro-life but am not persuaded by this, because <i>prison is also irreversible</i>.  After you've locked someone up for ten years and discovered, whoops, he was innocent, you can free him but you <i>can't free him ten years ago</i>.<p>(This is a philosophical point with serious policy implications: if you buy it, you'd want to shift your resources from opposing the death penalty qua death penalty to ensuring fair trials generally.)",1254118319

LCD pixel tech: pick IPS or PVA instead of cheaper TN. This very important spec is also intentionally left out of the official specsheet, but good IPS panels have 178/178 viewing angle, i.e. the same number vertically/horizontally. TN-based junk does not - you can tell even visually by tilting it left/right and up/down.<p>3. Backlight tech. Pick LED instead of CCFL.

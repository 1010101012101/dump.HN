804480,comment,804312,804389,0,0,ihartley,,,"Most manufacturers put the fuel door on the opposite side from the exhaust pipes. Also, even though it may not seem like a specific side would make any difference in the performance of the car, but when the tank/door are on the opposite side from the driver it keeps the suspension more balanced than if it's on the same side. As such, many performance cars have the gas cap on the right",1252050943
804479,comment,804217,804424,0,0,nostrademons,,,"That's been the business model of nearly every successful startup, and several unsuccessful ones:<p>Q[Facebook]: Isn't asking every teenager and 20-something to provide all their personal details, and then selling that to advertising partners, a massive privacy violation?<p>A: Maybe!  However, it will take years for that question to be resolved, and in the meantime every teenager and 20-something will happily provide those details so they can throw sheep at each other (and more importantly, hook up).  You are, of course, welcome to not use FaceBook, but then your friends will stop talking to you and you will never get laid.<p>Q[Youtube]: Isn't allowing anyone to upload video in seconds going to encourage massive copyright violation of all videos ever made?<p>A: Maybe!  However, it will take years for that question to be resolved in your favor in court.  And Google over there has a vested interest in making certain that it will not be resolved in your favor.   So before that happens, they will buy us for exorbitant amounts of money and sic their exorbitantly-priced lawyers on you.<p>Q[Napster]: Isn't providing a peer-to-peer music service just a way to encourage massive copyright violation?<p>A: Maybe!  However, it will take years for that question to be resolved in your favor in court, and by then we'll be the world's most influential Internet company, and you'll still just be some sap with a web page.  After we're a billion dollar company...oh shit, your lawyers are faster than we thought.<p>Q[Craigslist]: Isn't an anonymous classified-ads website just going to be a haven for prostitutes to pick up clients?<p>A: Maybe!  However, chances are that whatever judge you get uses those prostitutes' services, because he is not on FaceBook and hence doesn't get laid.  Case dismissed.",1252050746

There were ads on finance.yahoo.com at one point. The fact that they only amassed 94k uniques is almost laughable, poor retention/use of money--imo the whole ticketing business is a tough sell if you're just aggregating--<p>Tom and Dan have definitely put in a heart full effort--I think they probably understand the business just as well as fansnap (if not better) and spent much less money learning about it at the end of the day. Kudos to those guys bootstrapping an idea.",1252048670
804448,comment,803214,804169,0,0,thyrsus,,,"At one point Red Hat paid to get one of their releases ""officially"" tested as conforming to the POSIX standard, and passed, and was thus able to officially call that version of Linux ""Unix(TM)"".  I may be mistaken, but I haven't heard them pushing that any time recently, and the market doesn't seem to care, so I doubt they've continued jumping through that hoop.<p>Now, if you want to take a deeper interpretation of the analogy of ""clone"", as in duplicate DNA, then Linux is less of a clone of ""Unix"" than BSD, since it was independently written, and a judge has pretty much declared that it contains no copyrighted content that originated with ""Unix"".  Read the SCO travesty timeline at groklaw.com.  Meanwhile, the Berkeley (Berkeley Standard Distribution - BSD) folks actually worked from a copy of the original Bell Labs Unix - but worked so hard on it that in a much earlier court case, a judge made a (sealed) declaration that BSD had only a handful of lines left from the original code, and that Berkeley could distribute their work, with the exception of that handful, on their own terms.  Berkeley quickly replaced/removed any infringing content, and that became the basis for the *BSDs.<p>For the glorious history of Unix, read Peter Salus's ""A Quarter Century of Unix"".",1252048656

What is their incentive to even teach the subject properly?<p>Keeping their job?<p>If a company like StraighterLine wants to be taken seriously, they'll need to ensure people that they are giving quality classes and only passing people who learn the material.<p>My guess is that they'll end up some how auditing the professors, maybe randomly looking at tests to see if the people understand the material, etc...  Maybe they'll find some other mechanism, but as long as a good education is valued by employers, StraighterLine will need to find a way to prove it is giving one.<p>To be honest, my only real issue with treating these courses as accredited is the difficulty in validating who took the class (e.g. making sure someone didn't ask their friend to take the exams for them).",1252047808

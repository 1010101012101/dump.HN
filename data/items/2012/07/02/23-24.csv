4191726,comment,4191233,4191691,43,0,tptacek,,,"At grave risk of sounding even more patronizing than I usually do, let me try to help you with something:<p>HN people spend a lot of time arguing with each other, often about nonsense or trivia (hey, myself included). In those arguments, it is very normal to say ""I have trouble believing X is true"" or ""I have a hard time believing Y"". And while it's not the most polite way to express disagreement, it's more annoying than rude. (It is in fact a cardinal example of what my spouse Erin would say makes disagreeing with <i>me</i> annoying).<p>It is on the other hand <i>incredibly</i> rude to respond to someone who just made a categorical statement about something material (""We did not have a buyer from the beginning of the sale of Sortfolio"", for instance) with the words ""I have trouble believing you"". Unbelievably rude. I think it might even be more rude than directly saying ""I think you're a liar"", since it's so recklessly casual.<p>Noticing this, I quickly searched over my old comments, horrified that I might have made the same error, perhaps even repeatedly. It is the kind of obnoxiousness to which I am prone. I am very relieved that I was not quickly able to come up with a comment here where I casually called someone else a liar.",1341273552

(Legal) marriage can only exist when a government explicitly defines the relationship and then issues privileges based on that definition. Marriage is a positive action. There is nothing to take away; gay rights activists are not just asking to be left alone, they're asking that we explicitly expand our definition to include their relationships. As above, it is not a forgone conclusion that the incentives for encouraging the citizenry to engage in permanent heterosexual relationships are applicable to homosexual relationships. It is a matter that must be considered separately.<p>Suppose I offer friend X twenty dollars. Now suppose friend Y also demands twenty dollars, and accuses me of violating my offer when I refuse it. That is what is happening here -- heterosexual and homosexual relationships are DIFFERENT and deserve independent consideration. Most communities have decided they want to offer an incentive for permanent heterosexual coupling; the same reasoning can NOT necessarily automatically be extrapolated and applied to homosexual coupling, just as I may offer friend X some money because he is poor or I owe him one or something like that, but that reasoning doesn't always automatically include friend Y. No right is being denied here.<p>Furthermore, no punishment is made due to ""brain chemistry""; we are not testing individuals and discarding them based on the presence of certain biological markers (either externally or internally visible) that exist through no personal or direct fault. We are simply choosing that we do not want to incentivize, endorse, or equalize permanent homosexual coupling as we do with permanent heterosexual coupling.

4191605,comment,4189040,4191027,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"Marriage is not a natural right, so first of all, no one has a ""right"" to marry. From the context of a debate about legalization of marital relationships, it's a privilege and a certification given by the government to a couple because the government feels there is a special social interest served by awarding that privilege and status to certain groups.<p>Marriage is NOT and has never been a ""love certificate"". It serves a real function.<p>Historically, that group has always been heterosexual pairings (and in some cases heterosexual groups). It is <i>not</i> simply a forgone conclusion that the interest of the state in granting marriage privileges to heterosexual couples automatically extends to homosexual couples -- there are important differences between the nature of these pairings, regardless of anyone's opinion on the morality of homosexual activity. The question, then, is ""is it in the interest of the community to promote homosexual pairing by providing special privileges to homosexual couples?""<p>In my opinion, it's not in the community's interest to do so. There are many reasons. One is that homosexuality is considered immoral by large swaths of the population, and that official sanction and promotion of homosexual pairing will anger this significant segment. Most of this segment is, however, at least <i>less opposed</i> to civil unions and the granting of certain default privileges that decent persons believe ought to be granted to persons who live as a couple, regardless of their affiliation or activity.<p>If the most vital privileges can be granted with a ""lesser"" legal status, and we can strike a reasonable compromise that promotes peace and civil discourse, isn't that better than choosing the more divisive, incendiary method?<p>I believe if the debate <i>really were</i> about basic privileges related to emergency medical notification, etc., gay rights activists would wait to push the ""marriage"" terminology. I think that the debate is <i>actually</i> more about validation; homosexuals demand the government grant them and their relationships equal standing and promotion as it grants heterosexual relationships. Gay rights activists are thereby attempting to use the government as a weapon to cram their concept of the equality of homosexual relationships down the throats of an otherwise skeptical public; over and over again referenda have shown that majorities in most states <i>DO NOT</i> want this to happen.<p>There are many other implications that flow from state equivocation of hetero and homo pairings. Religious groups may be censured for preaching doctrine that the state has deemed illegal; they may also be censured for exercising that doctrine, i.e. excluding practicing homosexuals from the clergy on grounds of unworthiness. In Massachusetts, we've already seen the complete withdrawal of Catholic Charities, as the courts attempted to force them to adopt to gay couples. This trend will become broader as gay marriages are legalized, recognized, and normalized, and may culminate in the denial of many religious services to the residents of many states.<p>Whether you think the religious are right or wrong in their assessment of the morality of homosexuality, you should be willing to protect their privilege to exercise and proclaim their beliefs that do not directly result in the termination of life or the loss of right and control of property, just as you expect the same privilege for yourself.<p>It's worth noting here that the attachment of negative attributes to homosexual practice need not be strictly associated with religion. An independent observer may likewise rule homosexuality irregular, abnormal, or otherwise not something worthy of active state promotion via marriage. Homosexuals cannot bear natural children. Homosexual couplings cannot provide the duality of permanent male-female parental role models, which I believe most of the West now wrongly considers worthless since so many were raised in single-parent homes. You may think this trivial now, but the fact is a huge component of the organization and legal recognition of marriage was the effect of parental partnership on children. Does the community really have an interest in equalizing homosexual and heterosexual couples, when homosexual marriage cannot produce any children in the first place by its very nature, and when any adopted children are automatically disadvantaged without even the prospect of opposite-sex parental role models (a ""mommy"" and a ""daddy"")?<p>I could go on; as I said, there are many angles to take on this, and many sides from which it appears negative. I understand that some people are eager to use the government to enforce their particular vision of equality on everyone else, and probably mean well, but that is not how a free society operates; you must convince people on your own merits, you don't just go and get the government to endorse your beliefs and then attempt to intimidate otherwise unwilling participants with that endorsement.",1341271542

If the new are just to justify being a dick, it's a positive step! ;) Besides, in my experience, if you find behaviors on the Internet anti-social, you don't know many schools.<p>The Internet is just the perfect medium of communication for misfits, from the people with weird passions, to the non-socials (like me), to the anti-socials. And the gaming culture is worse because it's the zone of the Internet full of 14 year olds. I don't think there's any new worrying trend, compared to what I've seen before.<p>Then again, I come from a somewhat different culture, so maybe it's worse there in the US.<p>But! Getting back to the topic, we should consider if Mr. Carreon's initial actions weren't the really anti-social behaviors. Threatening to sue people for complaining that your (or in this case, your client's) business model rests in using content made by others without so much as a link is hardly a nice thing to do.<p>So yes, they're human beings.

Using our music platform, the more fans that pledge to purchase an album the cheaper a project becomes because the price is driven down through their social network outreach. Cheaper price = Happy fans. Plus, the artists benefit too. By pre-selling a new album, artists get fan reach, cash flow to fund the project, and a marketing platform to cross-promote their new work!<p>I was hoping to get some feedback back from the community...<p>Cheers,<p>Omri",1341270305

There was also a steady stream of new leads to Atlas as the agency side acquired new clients.  I think the opportunity that was missed was to tie the MSN search business with the banner/rich media ad serving business and create a single platform to reach and remarket based on search intent.  A lot of this is done today but this deal was 5 years ago and would have been more groundbreaking.<p>- The agency side of the business wasn't interesting to Microsoft but at that time, Avenue A | Razorfish was the top digital agency in the US with clients from Expedia to Nike to Best Buy.  The team at AA|RF had a direct line to the CMOs and worked in most cases as an extension of the marketing teams for these Fortune 500 companies and MS could have leveraged this team as a focus group and to enroll these clients to test innovative ways to market across a publishing network like MSN (still a top portal property).  I don't think this was done and again another opportunity missed.<p>Overall, I just felt that there was the potential for aQuantive to help Microsoft close the ad revenue/platform gap with Google and they missed the boat.",1341270220

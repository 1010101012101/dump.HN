They're already resorting to patents to fight off competition.<p>Dropbox's simplicity is it's own undoing in the long run; it's too easy to commoditize. They'll be forced to lower their price to the cost of storage and that's when Apple and Microsoft will just subsidize their own offerings and kill them, unless a regulator notices it on time.<p>Google is not a good counter example; it seems simple to the user, but as Bing has shown, it's very hard to replicate.

But a lot of it will never play <i>correctly</i> (in terms of gameplay feel) because of the iPhone's lack of any physical controller.<p>There are quite a few games (eg.

Of course he didn't want to take over the world, he simply saw a profitable idea (after it was given to him by someone else) and took advantage of that. The main reason someone takes an idea that isn't theirs is for their personal gain, not because they truly want to do something substantial. Only someone who has the initial idea, someone who sees the problem area and can see a way to fix it, those are the ones capable of changing the world for the better (ok, ok, the Winklevoss twins probably didn't want to change the world for the better, but at least they had that initial thought). Otherwise, you're left with some d-bag taking advantage of something someone else saw simply for personal, profitable reasons. This video is proof the guy is no 'trendsetter' in technology.

From the beginning I wanted to expand the site to other schools. That's why I spent a ton of time making the photo module on the home page (<a href=""http://housesystem.thinkcomputer.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://housesystem.thinkcomputer.com</a>) modular: so that users could eventually upload their own photos to the photo album of whatever place they were at. I was inspired by the model of the Daily Jolt, which my cousin at Brown showed me during my sophomore year (2002-2003), but I thought it lacked important features. Your assertion about my lacking vision is therefore incorrect, not to mention a little insulting.<p>I decided not to keep going with houseSYSTEM because I thought I could come up with a better idea than an integrated network for students. And I did. It's an integrated network for businesses, and as beneficial as houseSYSTEM was to the student population, what I'm working on has far more potential when you think about things on a large scale. That requires a bit of vision, don't you think?<p>I deserve credit because I worked day and night for months to write code for a product called The Facebook that was part of an integrated environment for students, and every feature I created is available in some form on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com</a> now, which started as an integrated environment for students with similar or identical integration. It's not about inventing social networking at all, and I've never once claimed that.<p>But as you argue, maybe that's all just as common as building a chair. Even if Mark had never met me, he was influenced by houseSYSTEM. As Harvard tries to teach you from the minute you get there (because it's common sense), it's proper to acknowledge work that has influenced you (as I have in this post, for example). It's improper to plagiarize or make false claims.<p>It's true, I never had the vision to make Facebook what it is today because I wholeheartedly disagree that what Facebook is today is a good thing. My Facebook would have been far smaller with fewer users, but far better. That's the vision I still have, but I'll have to call it something else when I get around to it.",1313301877

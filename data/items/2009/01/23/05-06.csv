PHP programmers usually gravitate to PHP without having much experience with related, but supposedly better, languages like Ruby, Python, Lua, etc. But PHP programmers who really dig into programming often leave for other languages. The Ruby and Python communities are full of ex-PHPers. But how many people from the Python or Ruby communities leave for PHP?<p>This isn't to say that PHP has no merit.

They're based on my own experience with CL (and Elisp) and might not apply to you. Going from Scheme to Clojure will be a bit of a shock, though, because the former is absolutely as sparse as possible with lexical punctuation, and the latter is totally littered with it (particularly stuff that's borrowed from Perl and Ruby). If you've written enough Perl, though, you might not care.<p>By the way: Scheme is Latin, and CL is Ancient Greek. ;)",1232686812

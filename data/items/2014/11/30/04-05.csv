For example, films with a lot of mixed live action and CGI can take a lot of manual frame by frame work, and anything involving realistic character animation is a huge time sink. Not to mention huge server farms.<p>It looks like this film uses a limited number of shots (no cutting rapidly like action films), takes advantage of a lot of nasa and other imagery/data (no army of matte painters), limits characters to simple walking movements (no Pixar gesticulating), and probably keeps the particle effects and physics sims minimal (no computational fluids sims for glorious explosions).",1417322724

8675989,comment,8675280,8675458,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Julia does vectors well, but scalar computations are very important. The problem with vector computations:<p><pre><code>    z = x*(v+w)\n</code></pre>\nThis involves a memory allocation for v+w, and a second one for the product x times result. One way to avoid this in numpy is careful use of out:<p><pre><code>    z = zeros(shape=x.shape, dtype=float)\n    add(v,w,out=z)\n    multiply(x,z,out=z)\n</code></pre>\nAn even faster way, which only requires traversing the arrays once, and is more readable in my opinion, is a simple for loop:<p><pre><code>    for i=1:len(x)\n      z[i] = x[i]*(v[i]+w[i])\n    end\n</code></pre>\nThis also lets you more easily put if statements inside loops, etc. You can also do accumulative calculations without creating intermediate arrays at all. I.e. one way to create a random walk is:<p><pre><code>    walk = cumsum(bernoulli(p).rvs(1024))\n    end_result = walk[-1]\n</code></pre>\nAnother way is:<p><pre><code>    end_result = 0\n    for i=1:1024\n      if rand() < p\n        end_result += 1\n      end\n    end</code></pre>",1417322349

Let me try again:<p>My point is that the goals of this project seem to introduce more problems than it solves.<p>It re-creates the same HTML header/footer for every request, but then doesn&#x27;t do the actual markdown conversion, and it doesn&#x27;t even serve the associated JS, CSS, etc files that are required to make it work.<p>A simple Markdown to styled page(s) tool is a great idea, I wrote one myself a few years ago, before moving onto things like Gollum. Having a read-only tool like this is a great alternative to the extra weight of something like Gollum, but this just doesn&#x27;t really solve the problem very well right now, IMO.<p>Given that it runs on Node, you could quite easily add a few features to make it a more complete solution:<p>* Serve all assets - in this way, this can be used standalone, behind a caching proxy like varnish, or as an origin server for a CDN service like Akamai or similar. The specific JS and CSS that it requires could be bundled outside the document root and handled as a special case in the url router.<p>* Handle markdown conversion in the server. The client-side code can probably run with little if any modification in Node, and would reduce the number of resources and processing time required on the client device",1417320299

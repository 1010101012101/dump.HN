Would you change certain factors or add anything?<p>I&#x27;m also curious about how you evaluated diversity.  For example, my current city and one I&#x27;m intimately familiar with (Denver) scores only a 2 on diversity, while Boston scores a 5.  Ethnically, both cities&#x27; largest demographic is non-hispanic whites (Denver 52%, Boston 47% -- not tremendously different; when you add in suburbs Boston is considerably whiter than Denver).  The next two groups for Denver are Hispanic or Latino (32%) and Black or African American (10%), and for Boston Black or African American (24%) and Hispanic or Latino (17%).  Again, these don&#x27;t seem tremendously different to me.  Denver has the largest Mongolian population in the United States, hosts one of the largest Native American Pow-Wows in the country, and has had 2 Black mayors and one Hispanic mayor (Boston has never elected a non-white mayor.)  I realize there are other forms of diversity, but Denver does fairly well on those too (for example, 5.8% of Denver&#x27;s population is LGBT; Boston is a slightly higher 6.2%.)  Point being, I don&#x27;t understand what criteria were used to score these cities on opposite ends of the diversity spectrum given that they both seem fairly diverse to my eye.",1408174931

Learning about Binary Economics has led me into an interest in alternative economic theories.  There are sites and books dedicated to the subject, the following excerpt from the previously linked wikipedia page was the connection I had made, but really he was trying to solve problems related to measuring production with regards to automation.  With the advent of the computer age, it was viewed as inevitable.<p>`Binary productiveness is distinctly different from the conventional economic concept of productivity.  Binary productiveness attempts to quantify the proportion of output contributed by total labor input and total capital input respectively, Adding capital inputs to a production process increases labor productivity, but binary economic theory argues that it decreases labor productiveness (i.e. the proportion of the total output with the support of both labor and capital that the labor inputs could have produced alone). For example, if the invention of a shovel allows a laborer to dig a hole in quarter of the time it would take him without the spade, binary economists would consider 75% of the &quot;productiveness&quot; to come from the shovel and only 25% from the laborer.`<p>`Kelso used the concept of productiveness to support his theory of distributive justice, arguing that as capital increasingly substitutes for labor...&quot;workers can legitimately claim from their aggregate labor only a decreasing percentage of total output&quot;, implying they would need to acquire capital holdings to maintain their level of income.`<p>and<p>`...Kelso had uncovered over years of intensive reading, research and thought, drastically modifies the classical paradigm which has dominated formal economics since Adam Smith. It concerns the effect of technological change on the distributive dynamics of a private property, free market economy. Technological change, Kelso concluded, makes tools, machines, structures and processes ever more productive while leaving human productivity largely unchanged. The result is that primary distribution through the free market economy (whose distributive principle is &quot;to each according to his production&quot;) delivers progressively more market-sourced income to capital owners and progressively less to workers who make their contributions through labor.`",1408174105

It is popular elsewhere because it really flies over sand dunes.<p>Granted this is not Green Arabia knowledge, but I thought it might be fun for some.<p>I may or may not have heard how people buy these cars in GCC countries and drive them through Oman and onward to sell in the black market for crazy prices in Yemen.  This is one of many fun things I have heard about the black market in Yemen.<p>Since you generate a lot of interest with this stuff on HN (but you write better), maybe I will start writing this stuff.",1408173296

Your username -- throwaway.cpp -- I&#x27;m assuming you&#x27;re a C++ programmer or have been at some point? Then you and I have a lot in common. C++ is a great language, but after about 10 years, you can reach a level of mastery where there&#x27;s not much more interesting things left out there for you to learn and play with. If you&#x27;re someone who started developing because you enjoy it, this is around the point where you should probably consider rebooting yourself into a completely different technology stack (or stacks). I did this and it worked out very well. Not only that, after working with something like C++, almost every other language is a cakewalk (and also more pleasant to code in).",1408172498

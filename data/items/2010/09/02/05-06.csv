1655422,comment,1655205,1655325,0,0,trominos,,,"Thanks for the explanation. One thing that's confusing me: if the company gets a Series A round, convertible debt is worse than the equity you would've gotten because you've essentially chosen to invest as a VC rather than an angel (which means you're investing, in all likelihood, at a higher valuation). This isn't true if the valuation cap is sufficiently small, but then why not just get equity out the door?<p>If the company goes bust convertible debt is worth nothing, like equity.<p>Where's the upside? Convertible debt seems like a strictly worse investment than stock.",1283407083

IMHO he's assuming more of a financial background than his usual hacker audience has.<p>I once read that the road to mastery of a subject is:<p>1. No knowledge and a lack of awareness of the knowledge you need (eg. I don't know how to drive and I don't even know what I need to learn)<p>2. No knowledge, but conscious of what needs to be learnt (I don't know how to drive but the instructor has told me what I'm going to learn)<p>3. Knowledge and still conscious of what needed to be learnt to get there (I've learnt how to drive but I have to consciously think about changing gears)<p>4. Knowledge without awareness of application (Driving is now part of my kinesthetic memory and I can concentrate on my phone calls instead)<p>The point is - an expert can't teach from level 4. They have to go back to 3. If they can't do that they're still an expert, but a bad teacher.<p>My brother's like that with chemistry - dare to ask a question and you'll get a PhD level answer.

599196,comment,595950,599086,0,0,wheels,,,"> <i>though your example use case makes me feel funny, and not in a good way</i><p>mmap is a way of treating files or parts of files as memory when interacting with them and is used pretty often in low-ish level stuff that does file wrangling as it's one of the more performant ways of doing random access on a file.  Since those files are being accessed as memory they consume space from the 4 GB of address space on a 32-bit platform, but don't take up physical memory (except insofar as their contents is cached in disk buffers).<p>That's one thing that's often misunderstood with the 32-bit limitation -- <i>address space</i> is limited; modern ""32-bit"" CPUs have used 36-bit addressing internally for quite some time, meaning they can address 64 GB rather than 4 GB of RAM (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension</a>).<p>Because of the address space limitations you also don't have a full 4 GB to work with inside of a process on 32-bit platforms -- if you try to allocate a 3.5 GB block of memory it will usually fail because there's no contiguous  block of address space available, even if there's 3.5 GB of unused memory.  Typically the Linux kernel reserves 1 GB of address space for itself, and user space reserves a block for memory mapped I/O devices as well.<p>There's a pretty good article explaining some of this here:<p><a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/node/2450"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kerneltrap.org/node/2450</a><p>Now, all of that said, I'm not disagreeing with your advice -- just noting that there are some (mostly corner-) cases where you do need the address space, but may not need the physical memory.",1241757832

If your page is content-free, their automated algorithms which calculate Quality Score, a key metric which determines how much you pay, are going to penalize you.  If you use the landing page as a squeeze page (i.e. ""sign up for our mailing list for when we release!"", the most frequent suggestion) your QS will drop so low you will probably terminate your test quickly, after you start getting charged 10 to 100 times the going rate for clicks.<p>AdWords will also manually ban an account they catch doing this.

But, this topic touches on a very important issue in software we face right now.  Over the lifetime of the software industry we've experimented with lots of interesting business models.  Some have panned out better than others.  My suspicion is that selling software has been the most profitable.  Preliminary evidence from iPhone app store has seemed to agree this as well.<p>Prior to 2000 IT industry was making large sums of money mainly from selling software.  After the dot com bubble lots of companies selling software took a hit too.  The bust wasn't limited to the web.  Lots of customers realized they weren't getting the ROI from the software they purchased.  Since then the industry fundamentally shifted.<p>The rise of open source software started to replace previously commercial software.  In many respects were much better in quality than commercial software.  Linux was making serious advances towards Microsoft's dominance in the server market.  And, since then open source software has matured and has advanced rapidly into markets previously dominated by commercial software vendors.  Once open source software options come into these markets they exert serious downward pressure on the ability for commercial companies to stay viable.<p>Take for example BEA.  In early 2000's BEA was a market leader with it's Java application server.  In fact BEA was the fastest growing software company ever, and I think that's still true.  Over $1 Billion in sales in under 5 years.  Amazing.  Then JBoss showed up.  In many respects JBoss' application server was superior to BEA's.  Once JBoss came in they created serious pressure on BEA's ability to sell their server.  Why purchase BEA when you can get a better server for free?  In the end both companies were sold.  Red hat bought JBoss for around $350-$400 million.  Oracle snapped up BEA for $7 Billion.<p>Open source has proven itself as the best way to build software.  However, it's the worst way to monetize it.  Selling software works.",1241755635

For my tastes I found ""music that is listened to by people who listen to Eels"" was interesting. It also worked with ""Sly and the Family Stone"". What I peronally like about this is that it's a mix of stuff I know and like with new and interesting music so the new stuff gets a chance to creep up on me.<p>BBC Radio 6 Music is basically a bunch of musos playing good tunes. So good in fact that they're alledgedly going to kill it soon in some big reshuffle, enjoy it while it lasts.<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/</a><p>Since they log every track they play on last.fm you can also listen to BBC Radio 6 style music on Last.fm here:<p><a href=""http://www.last.fm/listen/user/bbc6music/personal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.last.fm/listen/user/bbc6music/personal</a><p>My own personal fave tactic is to research my favourite bands and listen to the music they liked (including who they cover, namecheck, sample, work with etc.).

I have a really good friend with aspergers syndrome who has as slightly higher IQ (190's) than mine.

1161131,comment,1160993,1160993,0,0,_delirium,,,"This seems like an oddly backwards take on blogging. Do you really start a blog solely because it's a way to flog your product?

There are plenty of people, including quite a few smart ones, blogging just to say things that they want to say, so it's a fairly competitive market in which you're up against people who are willing to work for free, because they categorize blogging as something other than work.<p>In fact, I'm not sure I <i>really</i> believe even he originally did it for that reason.

I majored in Business at university (and only subsequently taught myself to program so I could converse correctly with the programmers I employed) and we were taught to do a lot of market research before making a decision.  I've never really done that though and just chose a price which is why I asked the question. Maybe the market ultimately decides by whether they buy or not. Thank you for sharing though - really appreciate it and I'm sure others on here do also.  Best of luck with your venture",1267527886

Simply removing things does not necessarily mean better design.<p>It's like getting a car with raw power or good mileage. The trick is in getting as much of both as you can, but sometimes you may prefer one over the other.",1267527780

However, the top 0.1% or even 0.01% are possibly a much more monolithic group, perhaps largely involved in the financial services and banking industries? This may be the more relevant group to discuss.",1326661132
3468227,comment,3465102,3466713,2,0,gburt,,,"I'll concede my claim requires a belief in an absolute morality, which I don't necessarily, but take it my claim in the following form:<p>1. You believe that copyright infringement is a ""wrong"" committed by one party on another party (the victim).<p>2. A British national commits copyright infringement where the victim is in the United States.<p>3. The United States conceivably has a moral right to seek punishment against that British national.<p>I mean, to say otherwise would be to say that copyright existed within a border. We have treaties explicitly so that isn't so - if there were a place in the world where copyright law didn't apply, you couldn't post things on the Internet and expect it to retain its copyright.<p>I don't support extradition in this case. Don't get me wrong. I don't believe in an absolute morality, and I'm not even sure I believe that intellectual property is a good idea on balance, but the moral argument can be made if you're willing to speak in more concrete terms (i.e., if you're willing to accept the premise that copyright infringement is a global ""wrong"")",1326661131

(php/JavaScript/css/html). \nI have worked for several of the boutique web companies around Boulder doing things like: legacy bug fixes and enhancements to Zend applications, writing PHPUnit tests for an existing application, design and implement a customer catalog that can 1) be administered with a (simple) custom cms and also takes advantage of localStorage when users iOS device is offline. Other web stuff includes debugging cross brewer functionality and display issues. For database stuff I have always used MySql.<p>I have also done basic sys admin stuff - compiling ffmpeg for web and iOS optimized videos, integrating LibreOffice into an application for converting MS Office documents. I am comfortable on the command line and use emacs to edit most files.<p>I'm also open to remote but don't have any real experience on remote teams.<p>My previous career was in Biotechnology. I worked in the small molecule/drug discovery department of a large company and ran an LC-MS/MS instrument, collected data and compiled spreadsheets. That is where I learned about the power of automation with VBA to generate my run reports and set up my email releases to the team.<p>While at the large biotech company I did go back via night classes and get a second degree in comp sci; with regards to programming, I am self-taught.",1326661066
3468223,comment,3458611,3461821,3,0,HappyPerson,,,"I disagree that exceptional people will be exceptional people no matter what.  I am pretty sure most will agree that if we keep a baby in a dark closet, supplying only enough nutrition to stay alive, that baby will not likely turn into anyone typically considered exceptional.  What environment one grows up in <i>does</i> affect the odds of whether a person will someday be considered exceptional or not, and not always in the ways people might think.  For example, many would think having living, middle-class parents would be a help on the path to eminence, and yet, not necessarily so...Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi in the book ""Creativity"" notes that about three out of ten men and two out of ten women in his sample of eminently creative Americans (he calls them ""exceptional"") were orphaned before they reached their teens (and this study was conducted long after it was common for young people to lose their parents).  One theory is that this allows the young person to feel a great sense of liberation to be and do anything and at the same time, perhaps feel a tremendous burden to live up to the expectations attributed to a missing parent (having a parent just leave rather than die also seems to help give one an edge here).  Now it was also true that there were many example of a warm and stimulating family environment to conclude that hardship or conflict was necessary to give someone a creative urge, but what was noticed was that exceptional individuals <i>either</i> had the warm and stimulating environment or a very deprived and challenging one...what appeared to be missing was the common middle ground.<p>Social class is a similar scenario.  Only about 10% of the eminent people came from a middle-class childhood (which in America, is represented by way more than 10%, often I think more like 50% of the population).  About 30% of the eminent people in M.H.'s study had parents who were farmers, poor immigrants, or blue collar workers, but the parents didn't identify with their lower-class position and had high aspirations for their children to move up in the world.  Then about 34% had fathers who held an intellectual occupation (professor, writer, orchestra conductor, or research scientist). The remaining quarter were brought up with parents who were lawyers, physicians, or wealthy businessmen (and the general population has way fewer such people, as people here likely realize).  A quote on page 172 in the book reads:<p>""Clearly it helps to be born in a family where intellectual behavior is practiced, or in a family that values education as an avenue of mobility - but not in a family that is comfortably middle-class.""<p>Here is seems the author has concluded that there can be no intellectual behavior practiced or value of education as an avenue of mobility in a family that is comfortably middle-class, for which I would disagree.  But I do believe having the <i>contacts</i> that the upper class tend to have and the <i>drive</i> to have more than one has grown up with or to better the world or such are factors that contribute to how exceptional one becomes or is noticed as having become.<p>Another quote, this time from page 173:<p>""It is quite strange how little effect school-even high school-seems to have had on the lives of creative people.  Often one senses that, if anything, school threatened to extinguish the interest and curiosity that the child had discovered outside its walls.""<p>Choose your walls wisely.  Or choose to stay outside of walls.",1326661064

They received a letter back saying the domain was used for email. They never filed anything or took any further action. They went away. (And they had a trademark on the domain and I would say the name was valuable to them). A few years went by and the domain was then sold and the email transitioned.<p>I know of another case involving the NBA as well. In that case the domain pointed to a site but it had nothing to do with basketball. And many others involving less prominent trademark owners.<p>There is plenty of nuance in this business.

Impassioned approaches are great, but the moment you step on the big stage you have to become cold blooded and go for the jugular.<p>A big part of what I like about Alexis is that he's not that kind of guy. However, if he's going to be representing us in this fight then he needs to arm himself with the same drivel and talking points that his opponents have. Otherwise, he himself is just a tool to help drive home the point of the SOPA-PROS.<p>It's because of the capricious nature of this bill that we are left with the prospects that this could be used as a method to squash speech deemed undesired by those with the power to control it. Pointing out a hypothetical case where someone in an elevated position, like Rupert Murdock, could have had (online/third party) magazines, who were reporting on their recent phone tapping scandal, shutdown for any number of reasons would be a perfect example.<p>Many of us agree that piracy is primarily a service problem. The fact that Netflix makes up over 30% of the United States nightly internet traffic is proof. That's a whole lot of bandwidth that people are using because of the convenience. However, this can't be the only argument we make to say why this is poison legislation.<p>That said, I'd also like to have the talk that this legislation is still easily circumvented not even mentioned. It's worth noting, but once again it can't be a talking point as to why this legislation is bad.",1326660341

3468153,comment,3466865,3466865,2,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Thanks for following up on my poll. I really wanted the details on email like you mentioned but didn't want to have an outrageous number of choices. When I mentioned email I meant all of the choices you mentioned and I'm disappointed people didn't explain that part much but I'm glad people are getting into it here.<p>Anyway, I'll join in here. I've got 3 hosting accounts and 1Heroku app. On my shared host (mediaTemple gs) I just use their default email. For app notifications I'm using PHP's built in mail function with properly setup MX. There's no need for anything fancy on that account as its a dominantly static site that I just need to receive email from and use simple contact-form-type functions for sending mail from the site itself.<p>Then there's my VPS at Webbynode which I use to host multiple sites with Apache virtual hosts. I'm usually a huge control freak but decided to farm email out to Google Apps for the sites hosted on that server as they're mostly my playground/experiment projects. I'm still deciding what to use for outgoing mail from the apps on that server and for now I haven't enabled any notifications from anything hosted there.<p>Then there my Linode which is my baby that I care for to such a degree that I'm almost paralyzed by having to choose how to configure it perfectly. I used to have that server set up with Postfix in addition to my favorite app that I'm building there but just last night decided to remove it because of some of the comments from my earlier poll (the one that this post's OP wrote this in response to). I'm going to farm out company email because I don't want to deal with needing more memory, storage, processing power, etc. plus I'm just one man and dealing with domain keys, blacklists, and all those other delivery headaches are just too much for one person and I'd rather focus on the app itself. I'm leaning towards Google Apps for company email, Postmark for email from the app itself, plus Twilio for SMS notifications.<p>For all my mass emailing needs (newsletters and marketing and such) I've been using MailChimp for several months and I'm very happy with it. I use it across all my sites and apps that need it. I didn't mention my Heroku account because I don't plan to use any kind of email for that one. I may <i>want</i> it but there's no real justification for using it as that one is yet another playground for Ruby experiments and learning. It's hard for me to resist however because there are so soooo many new and shiny toys out these days that it's hard to focus. I've always been a strict PHP guy and now I'm off in 10 different directions with Rails, node, Python and everything else that ever gets mentioned on HN. I'm a dabbler in everything and a master of nothing (actually I'm a master of a few things but the dabbling to mastering ratio is heavily weighted toward the dabblng side).<p>So that's what I use and I'd also add that SaaS/PaaS and VPS/dedicated hosting is superior to other options but I still think its always good to have a spare shared hosting account lying around for times when you need to get something simple up very quickly as in just a few clicks. I love my VPSes to death but I've found myself glad to have my extra MT (gs) account on a number of occasions.",1326659765

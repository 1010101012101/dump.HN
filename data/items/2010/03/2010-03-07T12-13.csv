(I'm French.)<p>The CIA list apparently describes historical successive waves of immigration, which is definitely not how people in the French society would describe their ethnicity/identity. (And it's probably wrong in the same way for almost all other societies.)<p>This doesn't even take into account the fact that the French political culture actively discourages thinking one's identity in terms of ethnicity, and that many French people (of all ethnicities) would find any mention of ethnicity distasteful.<p>Particularly laughable in the French case is the ""Celtic and Latin with Teutonic"" label.<p>The lesson is simple : when localising, get local help. Ideally from several people, all of whom should both know their own society well, but also have extensive foreign experience (it helps because everyone has blind spots regarding his own society)",1267966627

1173307,comment,1170322,1170681,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Ugliness is not a nice thing to have! Like stupidity, or unfriendliness. At the extremes, words for those traits are also generic insults: words like ""hideous,"" ""retard,"" and ""asshole"" all describe people. And they're often used as more generic pejoratives.<p>These words are all relative. If you decide that ""asshole"" is simply too cruel a term, people end up using the next-cruelest term as the cruelest-possible one. So maybe if someone cuts you off in traffic, you say ""Jerk!"" But now ""jerk"" can't be used to categorize someone, since <i>it's</i> the worst word.<p>You'll just be forced to keep making your language more and more bland. There's no logical point at which your argument stops applying: ""He's very special, and doesn't play well with others. And he's a more authentically handsome person,"" will  eventually be wordy way to say ""He's a hideous, retarded asshole.""<p>There's no loss of meaning, but there's a profusion of syllables.

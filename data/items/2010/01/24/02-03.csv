1072886,comment,1072315,1072739,0,0,sketerpot,,,"Cool, there are a few things I've been wondering about for a while now.<p>Is it possible to make practical async logic on ordinary FPGAs? I've seen some very conservatively-designed async stuff that ran on an Altera FPGA, but I remember hearing that it was kind of flaky. (It was a Java-to-hardware synthesis program -- there's a remarkably direct mapping between the usual program structures like loops, if statements, etc., and hardware if you're willing to use a naive design.)<p>What are the prospects for putting asynchronous IP cores into a system-on-chip with mostly clocked parts?<p>What kind of async logic style do you usually use in practice? Dual-rail quasi-delay-insensitive, or bundled data with matched delays, or something so exotic that I've yet to hear of it?<p>I've heard some people speculating about how async circuits can be used to make fault-tolerant logic. For example, if you're using dual-rail coding, then a single bit flip is going to be detectable as a fault, and you can trigger some self-checking-and-repair logic without breaking your timing assumptions. How important/plausible would you say this is?",1264301947

Fortunately, this was a relatively new machine and the client didn't care about any of the data on it. (We have a strict ""format-and-reinstall as a last resort only"" policy on our flat-rate infected machine cleanups.)<p>If you can still get the machine to boot, I've had very good luck with ComboFix. (Make sure you get it from bleepingcomputer.com [1], not combofix.org, which is an unauthorized re-distribution.)<p>Most of the rootkits I'm seeing still aren't working directly on existing system files, a la the computer viruses of old. Instead, they're modifying ini files and then installing some cleverly hidden files in system directories. So, you can use tools like RootKit Revealer [2] to sniff them out. Actually removing any hidden files or hidden registry keys may require some expertise and serious effort -- we have a dedicated diagnostic system set up that we use to handle some of these things, with the drive removed from the client computer.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/sUBs/ComboFix.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.bleepingcomputer.com/sUBs/ComboFix.exe</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897445.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897445.asp...</a>",1264301810

And the type you'll get will most likely get you a few hundred visitors. i.e. a 50,000/mo blog, sent me 5 people.<p>And the traffic you get from doing a ""launch"" is usually garbage anyways. And will evaporate within a few days. Unless of course your core users are entrepeneurs who read tech blogs. Then you might have some luck.<p>Basically a launch doesn't really get you anywhere, you should see ""launch"" days, as a way for you to declare for yourself that you are open for business. So that you can get serious about marketing.<p>i.e. for my launch date, we got 5 stories, and a total of 668 visits.

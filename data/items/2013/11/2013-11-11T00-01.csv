6709271,comment,6709142,6709142,1,0,DigitalSea,,,"I think companies need to move past the whole &quot;no remote working allowed&quot; thing. Old style management coupled with fear of procrastination are two reasons many companies don&#x27;t embrace remote working. If you have proper management and metrics in place, it&#x27;s easy to ensure remote workers are hitting targets and putting hours in; source control, time management, Google Hangouts/Skype for meetings, email. There is no excuse.<p>Marissa Meyer seems to be stuck in the old world of IT thinking herself. While she&#x27;s taken Yahoo! to a better place because of her leadership, Yahoo! have lost a fair share of remote talent because of the rules she put in place banning remote working. Tonnes of companies embrace it (Github for one) and it opens up your recruitment opportunities 100 fold.<p>The only downside of remote workers is that they are separate from the core physical team, so they don&#x27;t nearly get close to enough opportunities to partake in social bonding and that rapport you establish with your co-workers getting to physically speak to them in the office and eat lunch with them. Remote working means you are detached from the company culture which depending on the place could either be a good or bad thing.

While you&#x27;re still crafting the post, you can set its sharing permissions such that no one else can see it. Perhaps you want to share it with individuals before you go public.<p>One way to publish it would be to have your front-end platform act as a subscriber to posts with some type of &quot;published&quot; flag. This sort of paradigm would be amenable to having multiple aggregators acting as the front-ends for syndicating content.<p>Comments on your posts would themselves be Tent posts, created by readers and hosted in their own Tents. Readers could have some of their conversations on your content publicly, but could also @-mention other users by Tent Entity URL to have private conversations within their social groups.<p>I really think the sky is the limit, because the system puts the data in the users&#x27; wheelhouses, and there can be all sorts of innovation in presentation and interactivity, decoupled with many of the concerns about storage.<p>Platforms could still monetize post content that they create and mediate, it&#x27;s just that users would be able to choose the platforms that serve them best, rewarding those providers.<p>I think there&#x27;s probably a lot of stuff to figure out still, but I&#x27;m very excited to see where this goes.",1384128306

I made a similar jump about 20 months ago.<p>My only advice to you is to keep doing the freelance gig thing on the side, as I see you are doing based on your comments.<p>The things I&#x27;ve learned about surviving:<p>1) As one commenter said, 6 months is basically no time at all. It will FLY by. Launching your side project to a state where you are comfortable with the project or can at least try it out in the market will take about 6 months.<p>2) For Freelance gigs - People will only pay you for what you&#x27;re good at and you have experience in.  It&#x27;s no different than finding a real job. No one will pay you for what you think you are good at, if you don&#x27;t have proven experience in it. This is good to know if you get in a money crunch. Always go back to your real strengths and the money will follow.<p>3) Always plan for Plan B. Build your professional network weekly if not daily in the industry where companies are willing to hire you if this venture doesn&#x27;t work out for you.<p>4) It will take you at least 3 months to find a job once you start looking, assuming you have the right marketable skills. It shouldn&#x27;t take that long, but it does. Plan accordingly.<p>5) You will need help about 3 months from now. You&#x27;ll be lost as you try to find yourself. Don&#x27;t be afraid to ask someone for guidance. You could be asking someone you met in Austin or someone you met recently. You never know.<p>6) Start a personal / professional mailing list. Allow people to have an insight into what you are doing. People like this kind of stuff. This allows you to stay in touch with lots of people fairly easily.<p>7) You never know.

Let&#x27;s be brutally honest:  the limiting factor for most of today&#x27;s software projects (i.e. CRUD websites and iPhone apps) is not technology.  It&#x27;s developer competency, experience and self-discipline.  I&#x27;d go so far to say that most working software developers don&#x27;t even <i>understand</i> the fundamentals of the technologies they&#x27;re using -- it&#x27;s why you see people replacing their relational databases for key-value stores, then trying to re-invent database join algorithms from scratch in the application layer.  Or why every new generation of &quot;engineers&quot; re-discovers asynchronous programming in a new language (then promptly writes a framework in Blub...because Blub is <i>so much better</i> than last year&#x27;s Blub.)<p>Truthfully, it&#x27;s pretty damned hard to find gigs working on the frontier of technology.  Most projects are predictable, tedious slogs to fit together well-understood technologies without shooting yourself in the foot.  And yes, requirements shift and clients get fussy, but that&#x27;s true of any engineering discipline.  You learn to pad the schedule to compensate for the shifts.  It&#x27;s part of being a professional.<p>As far as I can see, commercial software isn&#x27;t limited by &quot;major unknowns&quot;, so much as an industry-wide unwillingness to learn from experience.

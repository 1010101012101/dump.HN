4158953,comment,4157589,4157928,2,0,drivebyacct2,,,">This is a really stupid move. If someone is viewing my profile and looking for an email address, they're not looking for this one. If that was the case they could just message me through the website.<p>This seems painfully obvious to me. I am willing to assume that this change in visibility of email addresses was inadvertent or just a simple misthought choice, but it seems far more arrogant of Facebook to think that I'm going to use them as an email client. Ever. Besides the privacy implications, Facebooks messages feature and email, basically be definition and by 5+ years of usage, indicates that they're not the same thing.<p>This is the worst possible way I've seen someone use email, and I'm someone who will often use Facebook messages as it's a more reliable way of getting in touch with someone than email.",1340661547

You figure out a way to keep about half of your current strategy or assets or whatever fixed but applied in a new way to a new context, and change/recreate the other half. This is sort of what Microsoft is trying to do with Windows 8, they are keeping about half of their OS the same while radically changing the other half.<p>Compare with music theory for example - ""pivot tones"" are a way of making a smooth connection between chords in a harmonic progression, by keeping one or more notes the same while changing the others. Through a sequence of chord changes you can end up somewhere harmonically radically different from where you started, yet still keep each individual step smoothly connected to what came before.",1340661312

Back then I went through the available data in detail.  I didn't need to dive into the article posted to HN to know what they were doing.  Still, I did read the entire article and watched the video before posting.<p>As for the boundary layer issue.  A fluid (OK, liquid) based cooler has virtually none of these problems and does not require having MULTIPLE metal masses inside your computer spinning at 5,000 RPM (per the paper on the Sandia site).<p><a href=""https://ip.sandia.gov/techpdfs/Sandia%20Cooler%20presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip.sandia.gov/techpdfs/Sandia%20Cooler%20presentatio...</a><p>Remember that you need to cool memory, graphics cards and other elements in a typical design.  The air-based CPU cooler moves air around the CPU cabinet and out the back or top.  All of it serves to cool other elements.  Dust or not.<p>You can't put a bunch of 5,000 RPM coolers inside a<p>In a typical data center you have reasonably-clean air available.  Dust should not really be a problem except for the most neglected portions of an installation.  I have seen systems in service for years with no indications of dust accumulation at all.<p>Dust can be an issue in office or home environments.  Even then, from personal experience (and only from personal experience) I have never seen a problem.<p>I do think that the Sandia heatsink might have interesting applications as part of the heat-exchanger in a liquid-cooled system.<p>If you have a centrifugal fan turning at 5,000 RPM you are going to move a lot of air radially out.  So far all of their experiments seem to show the device working well in the context of pretty much an open air environment.  You can't have this pump simply circulate hot air inside a computer cabinet.  Because of that you will need to surround it with an intake structure as well as an exhaust structure.  This device sucks a lot of air at 5,000 RPM.  That, without a doubt, will be noisy.<p>There's also another element here that is not being compared.  How many cubic feet per minute of air is this device moving?  How would a stationary fin heatsink perform if you moved that much air through its fins.<p>A few years ago we modeled and built a custom heatsink that consisted of a centrifugal fan mounted at the center of a field of fins located at the exhaust of the fan.  Put another way, fan mounted at the center of a flat plate, intake is at the center, exhaust is radially outward.  The fins where located to ""grab"" and channel the exhaust flow.  They were also ""ducted"" meaning that the top of the fins had a ""roof"" so no air could escape without bathing the entire fin.  This heatsink performed very well.  Expensive to manufacture, but it did very, very well.  We could custom machine boundary layer control elements into the fins and do better yet.  The fan was an off-the shelf plastic DC brushless centrifugal fan with no thermal properties other than moving lots of air.  And it was quiet.<p>I am not necessarily putting down the Sandia fan.  I am simply saying that one should be careful not to be attracted to new shiny things without a little critical thinking.  I have seen companies waste millions by jumping into technologies that sounded great on paper an were later found impossible to commercialize due to a million real-world issues.",1340659826

The whole process is plagued by information assymetry with regards to transparency, and the renter is at a huge disadvantage. BadNYCApartments is trying to do something about this, but as far as I can tell, its NYC only still.<p>For example, some things I would like to know before renting a unit:<p>1) what persistent problems has this <i>specific</i> unit had? I live in a complex that spans an entire block. I can not find such information for this unit.<p>2) what kinds of ""fees"" does this landlord add to rent? And what are those fees on average? Our landlord just recently (without anyone's approval) got Valet garbage removal. I'm amazed such a thing could exist. The dumpster is right there, but we are now being charged $35/mo for something that nobody wants. And there are more animals and bugs in the area. More people snooping around. The fees are being added when the lease is up for renewal.<p>3) What is the average rate increase between renewals?<p>4) Smoke free areas. Without getting into the debate of whether this should be regulated; I would like to know how I can find buildings which are smoke free. For a number of years, a chain smoker in the building caused problems for almost everyone, as the secondhand smoke escaped his unit and migrated to the ventilation systems of everyone else. The landlord may try to help, but often there is little that can be done (and this is, unsurprisingly, very common according to the ALA). When he moved out, a few prospective tenants changed their mind because that unit still smelled like smoke after it was turned over. I was sad to see a young lady move into said unit recently, I wonder if she would have if she knew the place was likely a toxic cesspool. It still smells like smoke even with multiple passes of ozone generators. In addition, its unlikely that unit will ever be free of contaminants.<p><a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/allergy-and-asthma/articles/2010/12/17/smokers-former-homes-may-retain-tobacco-toxins"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.usnews.com/health-news/family-health/allergy-a...</a><p>5) What is the average amount of noise here?

Children and adults still get bullied every day for being gay, and people still feel uncomfortable coming out of the closet. Countless governments around the world, including the United States, still don't recognise the civil rights of gay humans, which broadcasts an unequivocal message to me and others like me that we are unwelcome, abnormal, and should be ashamed of ourselves. Turing was a genius, doubtless, but the tragedy of his suffering because of an oppressive government is a harrowing case study in how absolutely screwed up things can get, no matter how smart or important you are. The brilliance of Turing, and the shocking circumstances of his death, do not detract from one another. I strongly disagree with the portrayal of this as some kind of zero-sum match between the two aspects of his life.<p>The LGBT community has been actively fighting oppression for nearly a century. 80 years ago, the Nazi party started ostracising and killing homosexuals. 43 years ago the Stonewall riots occurred, during which LGBT Americans staged an act of civil disobedience that is still remembered in Pride and Christopher Street events around the world (and yet it was only in 2003 that sodomy laws were ruled unconstitutional). We're looking back on decades of an AIDS crisis where gay men in first-world countries have had to <i>fight</i>[1] for access to life-saving experimental drugs, and looking forward to a future (which may still be a long way off) where the United States, and other governments, recognise that gay people are people too.<p>So you know what? I think we're allowed one measly fucking hero figure. And if you don't want our gay voices ruining your programming idols, here's a very simple solution: stop persecuting the gay ones.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_Coalition_to_Unleash_Power#FDA"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS_Coalition_to_Unleash_Power...</a>",1340658808

Genuine security doesn't rely on it.

The source operating system FreeBSD has been doing this for years before OSX even existed. Microsoft was doing security way before MSE. MSE was held back because it had the potential to damage industry partner relationships. If Apple releases an AV no-one cares. If MS releases a good enough AV product the AV industry jumps up and down because MS just stole their lunch.<p>> In other words, Apple is both helping users to have a more secure experience (what do you think Gatekeeper is for?)<p>Apple is not helping users to have a more secure experience.

Do Not Track Legislation Will Hit Mid-Market Hardest",http://www.adotas.com/2012/06/who-ate-my-cookies-do-not-track-legislation-will-hit-mid-market-hardest/,"ADOTAS  A recent resurgence of display ads for B2B marketing might well point to a bright spot in a lackluster economy. Indeed, with the Interactive Advertising Bureau reporting a $31 billion business in 2011, internet advertising revenue numbers indicate a clear jump compared to 2010. But the rising success of ads is tied to third-party tracking, which uses cookies in browsers. So when the FTC began to push advertisers to implement a Do Not Track mechanism, marketers had to pay attention. While tracking is commonly associated with shopping, e-commerce and brand sites, a new study we conducted at Mintigo shows that a majority of B2B marketers now use tracking as well, and must be cognizant of the changes ahead.<p>Third-Party Tracking for Marketing Success<p>Over the past several years, third-party tracking  which uses cookies to collect information about web users so that ads can be targeted efficiently  has emerged to make online ads more profitable. The advances no doubt contributed to the growth of display ads, which previously languished behind search engine ads.<p>When Mintigo looked at top-ranked websites, we found that the use of third-party tracking was correlated to website traffic. Specifically, we found that third-party tracking was actually lower among the largest traffic sites, and peaked at 59 percent usage by midsize sites (those averaging an Alexa rank of approximately 3,000  see Figure 1).<p>Figure 1. Third-Party Tracking Peaks for Midsize Websites<p>In addition, certain industries like computers, software, internet, financial services and automotive now show more than 50 percent of top sites using third-party tracking (see Figure 2).<p>Figure 2. Third-Party Tracking by Category<p>Third-party tracking benefits the worlds midsize businesses, which leverage it to target their ideal audience  that is, customers who will most likely be interested in buying based on past browsing history. In some cases, it makes the difference between being profitable and not profitable.<p>However, the practice of third-party tracking has given rise to concerns over privacy. With the FTC threatening legislation, the advertising industry is considering a self-imposed Do Not Track mechanism. The chairman of the FTC has predicted that such a mechanism will be in place by the end of this year. In May, Microsoft announced that it would ship Internet Explorer 10 (IE10) with Do Not Track enabled by default. Although the default was ruled non-compliant with spec standards, in favor of opt-out cookie disabling by users, if such a default were to be honored by ad networks, it could in theory render the estimated 20 percent of web traffic that switches to IE10 un-targetable.<p>The bottom line is that Do Not Track could have serious implications for digital marketers at midsize to large companies. It is interesting to note that some of the largest websites in the world may be less affected by Do Not Track. Marquee sites such as Facebook, Yahoo!, and Amazon have such a high volume of traffic that they can rely on first-party tracking with their own traffic logs. After analyzing the correlation of company size and tracking practices, we determined that sites with the highest rank (i.e. the most web traffic) were not the highest users of third-party tracking. This may be for competitive reasons, or perhaps risk mitigation around privacy concerns. These large sites may gain a marketing advantage if Do Not Track advances, as they will still be able to leverage their volume of traffic to target audiences more effectively.<p>Innovative Alternatives That Work<p>With cookies at risk in the wake of Do Not Track, many marketers in midsize and large businesses will seek new alternatives to reach their ideal audience. Fortunately, todays marketer has new options from which to choose. It will be increasingly important to leverage the vast quantities of public information available on the web and social networks. While this overload of information is more than people can digest manually, technologies like semantic crawling and artificial intelligence make it possible to identify an audience without using cookies. Its even possible to discover proxies for buyer intent, which is perhaps the most exciting innovation of all.<p>According to Jeff Ernst, principal analyst at Forrester Research, B2B buyers leave lots of hints about their needs and buying intent through their social media profiles, updates and conversations in online communities. Technology that can discover these hints and identify ideal prospects will greatly improve how marketers target and communicate with buyers in the future.<p>The Do Not Track movement augers change for many marketers, but it does not spell disaster. Rather, it presents an opportunity to explore new approaches that yield marketing ROI and maintain a healthy balance with privacy concerns  a win-win for all involved.",1340658077

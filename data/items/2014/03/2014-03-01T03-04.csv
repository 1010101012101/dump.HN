7323036,comment,7320828,7322825,1,0,wtallis,,,"The efficiency thing is more about heat engines. When we&#x27;re just dissipating heat, the relevant relationship is that the rate of heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference. This is why a hot object that isn&#x27;t producing heat will cool exponentially. In the case of a steady-state source of heat, the temperature difference will be inversely proportional to the thermal conductivity of the connection between hot and cold reservoirs. Heatsinks and fans are used to increase that thermal conductivity so that the temperature difference stays small enough that the absolute temperature is safe. If you can double the tolerable temperature difference, then you can cut your fan speeds by more than half, or even get by with passive convection.<p>Or, approaching things differently, if you&#x27;re only going to keep your graphics card for two or three years, there&#x27;s no reason to let the fans spin up to an audible level until the chip reaches at least 80 degrees C.<p>Addressing a common misconception: fan speed/noise is not directly related to how much the graphics card is heating up the room by. Whether you run the fans at full tilt or you let the chip almost melt, the heat output will depend only on the workload.",1393646101

I think the most useful subreddits by far are heavily moderated subreddits like /r/AskHistorians or /r/Standup.<p>I think the subreddit idea is brilliant. If reddit is going to survive, it will need to increase transparency for mods, and decrease the emphasis on the default subreddits. The problem is not that there&#x27;s too much moderation, the problem is that the default subreddits have such a wide audience because so many users never bother to subscribe to anything else. If a reddit competitor offered the democracy of subreddits without the gatekeepers of the default subreddits I would switch in a second.<p>If my memory serves, there were quite a few controversies that led to a bunch of people coming to reddit from Digg. There were quite a few influxes of Digg refugees. redditors complained about quality drops every time. This is before subreddits, of course.<p>The challenge, I think, is combining democracy with with some kind of editorial function.

Typical power consumption for a desktop box is around 90W if it is somewhat active vs. sleeping.  There are about 730 hours in a month, but his computer would be on say 30% of the time anyway, so that&#x27;s 511 extra hours per month.  That comes to 46 kWh per month of extra electricity, which in his area costs about 3.68 USD per month.<p>So the price is slightly less, but the value for money isn&#x27;t good with the home solution.  Then again, unemployed people are sometimes known to make suboptimal economic decisions in terms of expected value, because they&#x27;re optimizing for other things (e.g. being able to switch off a cost mid-month).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.oca.state.pa.us/Industry/Electric/elecomp/Archive/2014/ElecGuide_January2014.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oca.state.pa.us/Industry/Electric/elecomp/Archive...</a>",1393644307

But talking with your friends, in a safe, reliable way, is much harder than it should be. Secure, FOSS communication methods usually suffer from obscurity, and are typically still centralized, forcing the user to trust a server or to set up their own. We think it&#x27;s time that security and simplicity came together, available to everyone. Tox is an encrypted, peer-to-peer network for instant messaging, calling, and videochatting, one-on-one or in groups. Tox is a core protocol and API that anyone can make a client for. Existing clients are listed on http://wiki.tox.im/Clients, including:<p>• a cross-platform GTK client (https://github.com/naxuroqa/Venom)<p>• a cross-platform Qt client (https://github.com/nurupo/ProjectTox-Qt-GUI)<p>• an OS X client (https://github.com/stal888/Poison)<p>• an iOS client (https://github.com/Jman012/Toxicity)<p>• an Android client (https://github.com/Astonex/Antox)<p>• an ncurses-based terminal client for Unix-likes ( https://github.com/Tox/toxic )<p>The Tox core has been shared all over the internet by inspired enthusiasts, and has drawn the attention of many developers. However, the clients haven&#x27;t received nearly the same amount of publicity, and their developers need help to bring easy, secure communication to the masses. And since the core is a simple protocol library with an API (and with bindings available for many other languages), you can start your own client too.\nIf you fancy yourself more of a low-level programmer, help with the core is always appreciated: https://github.com/irungentoo/ProjectTox-Core\nDevelopers are always present over at #tox-dev on freenode.

Capital has become more mobile.<p><i>Actual</i> capital - machinery - has taken it as hard as has labor. This leads many to think that the increases may be closer to rents than profits. It&#x27;s also harder to say what the effect of online is; for people under ... what, 25-30?, &quot;likes&quot; on the Internet act as a form of currency that may verge on real currency at the edges.",1393642958

Even if Adobe were to never spend a dime on lawyers or lobbyists again, would they no longer have to pay software engineers too?<p>Again, for most content companies that have IP generation costs, how do you propose that they distribute the costs?<p>How does torrenting help solve the problem with the IP generation cost, considering you are claiming it&#x27;s the future?",1393642957

You know JavaScript, why don&#x27;t you contribute to NPM?<p>When that security bullshit happened with RubyGems a year ago, many members of the Ruby community pitched in and helped the RubyGems team get the site back in order, even making Chef scripts so the whole thing is repeatable.

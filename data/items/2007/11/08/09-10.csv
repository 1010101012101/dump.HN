Consider these stats from a not spectacularly successful app: <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/smincomebig.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techcrunch.com/wp-content/smincomebig.png</a><p>How many web 2.0 companies do you know that are pulling those numbers?<p>Facebook is the most viral platform in the history of man - making it easy to get a lot of users quickly makes it deal for experimentation.",1194515611

Besides, I think it could feasibly make sense for Energizer to pull this trick.  First off, you don't know how good a battery is until you buy it; some consumers may never find out for sure if they were ripped off.  So it's an experience/credence good.  As such people may depend on the brand and price to find out if it's a smart buy.<p>Some products have planned obsolescence.  They can be more disposable than advertised.  But if the consumer is loyal to the brand, he may keep buying the product.<p>\n",1194515018

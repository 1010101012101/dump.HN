The extra context they add around the research goes beyond just &#x27;hyperlinking&#x27; and it&#x27;s right to regulate.

The multiboot specification allows you to ask for a video framebuffer from the bootloader, and you&#x27;ll get a physical memory address where the linear video framebuffer resides. I bet UEFI has something similar too.<p>So these days, with the help of your bootloader, doing graphics on a bare metal kernel is as easy as using the text mode.",1386244561

Copying doesn&#x27;t take someone&#x27;s work from them, he or she still has access to it. Right or wrong, good or bad, it&#x27;s not theft. Unfortunately, much of the public debate surrounding copyright circles around appeals to emotion about how much like theft copyright violation is.<p>Personally, I&#x27;d say not at all. It might be similar conversion -- the use of someone&#x27;s property without their permission -- but I&#x27;m not sure about that.<p>There&#x27;s also the &quot;thingness&quot; of a work. In the usual sense, even if your first copy of a work is a thing, it&#x27;s not the same thing as a copy of it. And copyright necessarily acknowledges that, as the property like component is not the work, but the copyright itself. So the thing that is (sort of) yours -- if it exists enough to call it a thing -- is not the thing you created, it&#x27;s the legal instrument that controls replication of the thing you created.<p>You&#x27;re right, copyright is complicated.

6853808,comment,6850036,6852539,3,0,onetwofiveten,,,"You know, people talk about sociopaths a lot, and I get why, but I have a problem with the definition. The idea is that a sociopath is someone who lacks empathy (or, so I&#x27;ve read, is able to switch off their empathy) and prioritises their own needs. The behaviour is characterised as selfish, as in putting themselves first. This doesn&#x27;t really make sense to me, because there&#x27;s an implicit assumption about what actually benefits the sociopath.<p>Taking a step back, as far as I can see, a sociopath is someone who (either by choice or by nature) prioritises certain social drives over other social drives. The drives to be empathic and obey social expectations, norms and rules get ignored. However, the drives for status, money and power are prioritised above all others. These drives are still social in nature. They don&#x27;t actually convey a fundamental biological advantage.<p>I personally choose to aim to be a warm and caring human being, and, as a consequence of that, I have a really great relationship with my girlfriend. When we have kids, our kids will grow up in a loving supportive environment and so will have a good chance of growing up strong and well balanced. Being a sociopath would probably get me more material possessions, but I would have had to settle for an emotionally weaker partner (who I could dominate) and I would end up with messed up kids with a lower chance of success and survival.<p>From my own personal experience, people who fit the sociopathic archetype aren&#x27;t really like evil villains. They&#x27;re more like computer game addicts, fixated on goals that don&#x27;t bring them happiness, and that get in the way of forming genuine connections with other human beings. I can see why people who are the victims of their behaviour characterise it as selfish, because they see the world as a competition for money, status and power and they think they are losing out. However, that competition is just a game, and the grand prize is not happiness.",1386242111

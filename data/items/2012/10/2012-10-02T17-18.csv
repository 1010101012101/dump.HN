4603297,comment,4602631,4603087,5,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"The comment you're replying to didn't assert that most PHP developers are lazy and stupid, but rather asserted that most PHP programmers are using PHP because it's the first ""web"" language they were introduced to and they haven't really learned anything else.<p>And that's okay. But I'd strongly assert that ""PHP is quick, easy and gets the job done"" does <i>not</i> support the assertion ""PHP is a well-designed language."" From what I've seen, Laravel is as high-quality an MVC framework as anything you could find in another language. But if it's a truism that terrific coders can produce terrific code in any programming language -- and I think it is -- then ""there is terrific code in PHP"" is not a defense of PHP's language design.",1349200794

I used to have one that was very simple: I could set 2 times/temps for the week and 2 for the weekend. It was easy to program but didn't have much smarts. SO on days that I worked form home, it still let it get hotter/colder for my pre-programmed ""away"" time frame. So I was constantly tweaking it when I was not really away. My new house had some fancier ones that gave me more times/temps to program and I think I could adjust them per day (not just ""week"" and ""weekend"") but it was actually overly complicated to program. And some of the fancier ones still cost $150-175 at HD. So at $250, the Nest is not <i>that</i> much more expensive than some of the fancier ones at HD. But you get some much more ""smarts"" with it.

4603115,comment,4602436,4603000,39,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Its fairly straightforward. There is 'money' and there is 'stock'.<p>Money funds day to day operations, pays salaries, power bills etc.<p>Stock determines ownership, and in most corporations governance.<p>Now day to day you spend money and ideally you also get revenue. If the revenue that comes in for any given month/quarter is more than the money going out that month/quarter then you are 'operationally cash flow positive' meaning that other than something like a big lawsuit or a promissory note coming due or some big financial event you can keep working and the lights on. It doesn't necessarily mean you can hire anyone or 'grow' or fund a PR campaign.<p>Then there is stock which represents ownership in the company, there can be multiple classes of stock which convey different rights, and there can be corporate bylaws which change how decisions are made while private vs public, but for the simple case we'll assume that 1 to 1, one share of stock is worth 1/(total-stock) of the company and exerts an equivalent amount of control. When you make a decision for the company you at the board level you effectively 'vote your stock' when you vote. If 50.1% of the stock votes one way that is the way the decision goes.<p>So lets consider a couple of scenarios:<p>Lets say the Company is :<p><pre><code>   1,000,000 shares
   Investor A - 10% stock (100,000 shares)
   Investor B - 15% stock (150,000 shares)
   Investor C - 15% stock (150,000 shares)
   Founder A  - 25% stock (250,000 shares)
   Founder B  - 25% stock (250,000 shares)
   (everyone else in the company) - 10% remaining stock.
</code></pre>
Now the two founders, if they agree they can get their decisions ratified by the board with one additional investor voting with them. The 'value' of the company is price-per-share * total shares. So lets say this company was valued at $10M so each share is 'worth' $10.<p>Now you need more money (revenues aren't covering it) so you try to sell more stock which is going to change the numbers around. Lets say you need $10M for the next 24 months and none of the investors want to invest any more money. You've got a crisis. But if you are also independently wealthy you can say ""I'll put in the $10M but I'll take 2 million shares."" So the 'totals' after that transaction are 3 million shares in total (up from 1 million) and as a strict percentage we've got:<p><pre><code>   3,000,000 shares
   Investor A - 3.3% stock (100,000 shares)
   Investor B - 5% stock (150,000 shares)
   Investor C - 5% stock (150,000 shares)
   Founder A  - 8.3% stock (250,000 shares)
   Founder B  - 75% stock (2,250,000 shares)
   (everyone else in the company) - 3.3% remaining stock.
</code></pre>
Founder B now has 'sole control' because they have enough stock to make any decision, vote their own stock, and have that decision be ratified.",1349198684

I still use them for cases where I'm actually counting or measuring something, and unfortunately for bitfields.

But almost all of them had at least a few - but truthfully, that's a no brainer. Planscope's only useful if you've loaded in some tasks.<p>What I quickly began to realize was the obvious: when you go out of your way to <i>bring your paying clients into some new software</i>, you're probably going to stick with it. After all, no one wants to say to their client ""Oh, yeah, so that Planscope app we've been using... well the trial ran out. Let's move on!""<p>The less obvious was how important having a 3rd party tool was. If someone is paying for Harvest or Freckle, they obviously spend money on their business. +1. Likewise, if they use one of these tools they specifically signed up to Planscope because they hate tracking time and want to log their time from within their task management product. Once someone sees the magic of working on a task in Planscope and having their time logs synced, they're likely going to convert.<p>Actual metrics:<p>93% of paid customers have invited at least one client, most did it within the first few days. This is a chick-and-egg situation - some people sign up to Planscope when they hear about it, but their trial will likely expire before they have a new client project to work on. I'm working on ways to improve this.<p>78% of accounts have linked to a 3rd party tool. Not really sure yet if the remaining 22% don't know they can, don't have a tool we support, or don't have a tool at all.",1349197624

I can't lock the deadbolt on my apartment when I leave without the key. And I can't lock my car from outside without the key. It's a way of forcing me to always have my keys.<p>So while I love the convenience this idea provides for shared access to places, and for frictionless don't-even-have-to-get-out-my-keys access, locking oneself out is a solved problem in my book. (Sure, I could lose my keys, but I could also lose my phoneand the redundancy here is another nice and fun thing provided by this system.)<p>(This habit was largely inspired by getting a car which refused to let me lock myself out: if I pushed the lock button down on the driver's door while the door was open, and then shut the door, it unlocked itself. Previously I'd had one where you held the handle out to override this behavior, but this one insisted on being locked from the outside. And then I noticed that this was keeping my from locking myself out like I had a few times with the old one.)",1349197557

There were tablets before the iPad, and smart(ish) phones before the iPhone, but the Apple products were the first that were not only useful, but a pleasure to use. Jobs was well known for his stubbornness and knack for saying ""no"". I'm concerned that without his almost dictator-like control over product direction, Apple may begin to release compromised products that don't deliver on their values of creating a simplified and effortless user experience.",1349197266

7627104,comment,7626587,7626957,1,0,kitd,,,"I wouldn&#x27;t say that KDFs used this way is &quot;abuse&quot; any more than hash functions used for secure storage is abuse. It all comes down to what you mean by &quot;hashing&quot;.<p>The problem is that the same word &quot;hashing&quot; is widely used (incl by experts) for 2 different things, normal insecure hashing and cryptographic hashing. As he points out, the 2 have different purposes, ie CRC for large files & git blobs, etc for the first, and cryptographically secure storage of small strings for the 2nd.<p>KDFs meet all the requirements of cryptographic hashing. Maybe a new term is needed for the process of cryptographic hashing, like &quot;scrambling&quot;, or something that suggests secrecy, rather than just generating a unique value.",1398167965

7627081,comment,7624528,7624528,3,0,oneofthose,,,"Some commenters seem to be offended by the way Bartosz presents his insights. Maybe some background is necessary. Bartosz has been pushing the C++ community for some time now to think more functional and consider the excellent properties of functional languages. His posts are great and his talks are very enlightening. I recommend his recent talk &quot;I see a Monad in Your Future&quot; [0] and I&#x27;m looking forward to his talk at C++Now.<p>Many of Bartosz&#x27; discussions focus on concurrency. It is one of the big and interesting problems we have at the moment. The criticism repeated here that &quot;No one will ever be able to debug it&quot; and the like is exactly what Bartosz sees in our future if we continue to program concurrent systems the way we do. He favours adoption of functional programming concepts to manage the complexity of concurrent systems. And I agree.<p>If code similar to the code in his blog is not acceptable in production code, a code review should make sure it never reaches production. An informed discussion about the pros and cons of such code could ensue during the code review, new insights are gained and everyone walks away a better, more knowledgeable programmer. I suspect this is one of Bartosz main goals.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFnhhPehpKw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFnhhPehpKw</a>",1398167657

Don&#x27;t be afraid to link from the FAQ answer to really gritty, technical explanations.  SOme of the best sites I&#x27;ve used have these step-by-step techie pages filed under &#x27;Knowledge Base&#x27; but easily found through a FAQ.<p>3. For Pete&#x27;s sake, prune your FAQs!  Frustrating to pick through a page that has been static for five years and references out-of-production products.<p>4.

Recently, sociologists of religion have questioned that figure, saying Americans tend to exaggerate how often they attend. By actually counting the number of people who showed up at representative sample of churches, two researchers, Kirk Hadaway and Penny Marler found that only 20.4 percent of the population, or half the Gallup figure, attended church each weekend. \nAs added proof for the accuracy of this smaller percentage of churchgoers, if 20.4% of Americans (approximately 63 million in 2010) attended the nation&#x27;s 350,000 congregations weekly then the average attendance would be 180 people per congregation which is almost exactly the figure that numerous research studies have found.&quot;",1398166498

You can then store SHA256(key) instead of KDF(password, salt).<p>2) Use public keys. This requires some fancy infrastructure like a keychains, keybase.io, PGP software etc, but it is the most secure solution. User saves only his public key on the server and signs authentication token when he wants to get in. Server has absolutely no secret material to leak, while the user has complete control over safety of his keys. This is how SSH works. The reason it is not widely used on the web is because we don&#x27;t yet have nice infrastructure: nice UI for keychains and protocols for one-click sign-in via crypto signatures.

It scaled perfectly well for 3 centuries with no reason not to continue scaling with the requisite funding.  It could be argued that the concept of a library has scaled since 2600 BC.  It scales for almost every town in the Western world and every single University, College and School worldwide.  Beyond food/clean water sources and a medical centre the next municipal institution offered to struggling African and Southern American communities is often a School/Library with books.<p>In the West, demand is tempered by the need to physically go to a Library to source the media for consumption.  Some might see this as a barrier to entry for certain customers; good.  It is not a barrier to scaling though, it is a net benefit that makes the customer flow manageable.<p>A similar argument can be made against Amazon.  <i>You physically need to access the internet?  You need a computer or mobile device?  You need a payment card?  You need an address?</i> Ha.  Too many barriers.<p>The only barrier to a library is physically arriving at the library and in some cases mobile libraries will come to you with an RV packed with media for free consumption.<p>Only a person blinded by the current SV-inspired business models can look at something in existence, already scaling and say <i>according to me I do not believe this idea scales</i><p>2.  Since it is impossible for any individual to consume the sum total of media at the same time the system has built in redundancy guaranteeing it scales effectively.  IE You cannot physically check out and consume every piece of media therefore unlimited copies are not required to be stored.  Data analysis yields the optimum level of media storage further improved by aggregating analysed lending habits.<p>3.  Libraries are not weakened by greater public interest, they are strengthened by it.  The demise of the social library has been largely brought about by the ubiquitousness of online content (including piracy).  If those sources dried up overnight library use would explode in growth and Governments would double their budgets.<p>The idea that if libraries suddenly gained <i>too many</i> customers they would be shut down is ludicrous with absolutely no credible reasoning.<p><i>Source</i>:  History.",1398164521

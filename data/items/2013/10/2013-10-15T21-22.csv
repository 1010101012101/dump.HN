Even if we did remove the legal and economic restrictions, we still can&#x27;t achieve perfect labour mobility without breaking down a person&#x27;s social ties to family, friends and community.  Although some neoliberals have put a lot of effort into doing so.<p>> And when workers in these countries do manage to achieve a modest increase in working conditions and therefore wages, the employers can simply pack up shop and head to the next cheap market.<p>It&#x27;s true, just as &quot;Made in Japan&quot; and &quot;Made in Taiwan&quot; were once considered how &quot;Made in China&quot; is today. And now we see  the rising wages in China triggering manufacturers moving to Indonesia and the Philippines.<p>In this regard at least, the globalisation of manufacturing is a force for good.

6556631,comment,6553794,6555615,3,0,ori_b,,,"> The arms race never ends, and keeping up with it is a full-time job. asm.js fixes this, by precisely specifying the &#x27;sweet spot&#x27; and giving you a guarantee that if you satisfy its requirements, all your code will be optimized, unless the VM is broken.<p>I&#x27;m not convinced that &#x27;use asm&#x27; helps with that at all. Static compilation of the sort that asm.js gives you is <i>also</i> full of heuristics. Even in C, you&#x27;ve got that sort of effect.<p>Tweak the inlining cost model, and suddenly your frequently called accessor function now has function call overhead, slowing everything down. Or maybe it decides that the cost of padding vectors is too high, and autovectorization shouldn&#x27;t be applied now. Or other dozens of similar heuristics.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you have a &#x27;use asm&#x27;; tweaking the compiler will change the heuristics and boot you out of the sweet spot.",1381874049

Stupid example I created just now: Instead of trying to go more with the flow when meeting friends a planner could spent more time before meeting friends to plan and prepare different options. The solution is still not as optimal as for a go-flow-guy, but it is possible to get around it without your friends realizing. On the other hand a go-flow-guy that is writing a master thesis might be better to plan for a very small topic and go for more iterations with the professor to get to a decent paper in the end. In both example I probably fail to show that the guy is actually applying his own style to a problem that is not meant for this style, just that he is more creative and willing to put in more energy to get to the same end result then the person with the other talent.<p>If you look closely at medium level chess players and kungfu arts then you see that they are also doing something like this.

It is still required, however, that they&#x27;ll need either to own this key pair being used at some point to listen in to the traffic.<p>But that would mean that they can likely change the key pair on the server but for some reason they can&#x27;t enable PFS, even though once they have access to the server in production, PFS is useless... so... who knows on that part.<p>tl;dr: If they get the key pair later (even if years later through brute forcing or whatnot) and don&#x27;t have access to the server, then PFS disabled is a bad thing. If they have control over the server or the server logs all the session keys and they receive these at some point in time, then PFS enabled is, of course, a useless thing. If they don&#x27;t get the key pair at any point, then it&#x27;s fine, but I&#x27;d consider that unlikely.<p>Edit: The proper way forward is to estimate the chance they will get the key, which might as well call at 50-50, multiply that by the losses you would incur where they to gain access to these emails (and that&#x27;s likely to amount to $0 for the vast majority, sorry if I&#x27;m being presumptuous and devaluing privacy) and compare that to the losses incurred if you didn&#x27;t have access to these emails.

One of the biggest requirements we are want is to have similar executing speed to c# & asp.net mvc. This requirement kind of throws out RoR & Django/python. We prefer a statically typed language but its not a hard set requirement. We dabbled with go & rust and enjoy both languages but I dont think rust is ready for prime time. We also worry about the ecosystem with go. If you base your business off the language and then google decided it was a toy project and drops its resources (ala google reader). Sure its open source which is all fine and dandy just as long someone decides to pick it up (death of ironpython & ironruby). If the community was as vibrant as RoR/Django/Node we probably wouldnt worry but it isnt. The only option I see left is either java or a language based on the JVM.

Not even sure if this is a really great way to benchmark drives, but here are the results:<p>Digital Ocean where my drive was /dev/vda:<p><pre><code>     Timing cached reads:   17246 MB in  2.00 seconds = 8632.56 MB/sec
     Timing buffered disk reads: 892 MB in  3.00 seconds = 297.20 MB/sec

Digital Ocean is also great although I have only really dipped my toes into their stuff. Have not tried their recently launched internal-networking yet. Also, unfortunately you cannot (easily) downsize a box, only expand one. Rather you need to create a backup and then a new box and restore the backup to that new box or something. Seems silly.

IANAL, but I&#x27;ve been through enough to know that courts will often/always consider the aspect of compliance known as &quot;good faith&quot;.  It&#x27;s almost certain that handing over the key and them immediately changing it would be seen by the presiding judge as compliance in bad faith, and would put him in a substantially worse position with regard to possible contempt.  Given this, unless Levison is legally suicidal, I think it&#x27;s a fair bet that any relaunch using a new key pair was done, at the very least, with the blessing of the feds and/or the judge.

(UPDATE: Vagrant 1.3.5 is now out and supports VirtualBox 4.3)<p>* VirtualBox 4.3 doesn&#x27;t run at all on Mavericks (10.9) because their kernel extensions aren&#x27;t signed. OS X 10.9 requires signed kexts now. So the changelog where they said &quot;limited&quot; Mavericks support they actually should&#x27;ve said &quot;no support&quot;. (UPDATE: Some people are reporting it is working for them on Mavericks. I can&#x27;t get it to work. YMMV)<p>Based on these two bullet points, I would stick with VirtualBox 4.2 for the time being. The bullet point that says &quot;rewritten VT-x and AMD-V code&quot; is especially vague and could be &quot;super unstable virtual machine manager&quot; just as easily as it can mean &quot;slight performance improvements.&quot; So be careful.<p>Other than that, it is good to see VirtualBox have some sort of big release. This is their first major (&quot;4.x&quot;) release in over a year.<p>I also want to note that if you are on Mavericks, VMware Fusion works perfectly. As a disclaimer to this sentence though: I make money from Vagrant + VMware users. I&#x27;m not trying to advertise that, I just want to state that Vagrant _itself_ is fine. VirtualBox 4.3 doesn&#x27;t work. VirtualBox 4.2 does. VMware Fusion 5 and 6 does.",1381871412

It looks like out of state tuition at community college is about $5000 in California, which isn&#x27;t so bad, but most places require you to live there a year without taking any classes in order to become a resident for college purposes (so you&#x27;d have to take a year off between community college and the four year, possibly), and finding a way to survive without a degree or any social network would have been quite difficult. I wouldn&#x27;t really have had the money to move out there when I was younger; it&#x27;s taken me this long to get to the east coast, which is a lot closer compared to California.<p>I think it&#x27;s a really great system for people who live in state, though! (or states close to California) I&#x27;ve heard some things about impacted classes, but it sounds like California has their CC -> 4 year transfer system set up much better than a lot of places. The regent scholarship sounds great, but it&#x27;d have been a huge gamble to try to move out there for it, since you won&#x27;t know until you&#x27;re applying to the four year school if you&#x27;ll get it or not. There are so many unknowns, when tuition is this high. The CoA for Berkeley for example is $33,000 for in state and over $50,000 for out of state.<p>Why is paying for college so much harder than getting accepted to one? Ugh.",1381871365

This guarantees that these issues will be immediately seen by the V8 team.<p>[to be completely precise anything that is related to correctness or performance of the language described in ECMA-262 can go directly to V8 issue tracker.

If so I will undo WontFix and CC relevant folks.<p>> for some reason at that time X.apply() and X.call() were special-cased to always assume that they were Function.apply or Function.call<p>To the best of my knowledge there was never an assumption like this in V8. Optimizer would detect Function.prototype.apply using a token attached to the closure value itself.

Maybe it's OK for his target audience, as I assume the layman won't be reading cryptome.org.<p>What we really need is a champion to explain in relatable, plain English why encryption is essential even for mom and dad, and to explain it in a more mainstream venue.  I think a big reason why people don't encrypt mail, etc., is because:<p>1) they don't know why it's important because nobody can explain it to them in relatable terms (like saying: when you send an email, Google keeps a copy forever, and the FBI can read it just by picking up a phone and asking nicely), and<p>2) if they do know the importance, the practicalities of encryption are explained impenetrably.  A blur of acronyms, bad metaphors (""keys?"" terrible choice of metaphor, considering how a pair is intertwined and their actual use), and no well-known authority you can trust to explain it all simply.<p>The problem isn't that people don't care.

Yes, XML is verbose, but that's exactly why Relax NG has a compact syntax. Use that if you don't like the XML syntax. Yes, data can be expressed as attributes or elements, but there are simple rules of thumb to decide between one or the other: if your data can have structure, or you may want to have multiple instances of the same thing, it's generally better to use an element; otherwise an attribute should do the trick.<p>There are also errors and approximations: XML did not introduce the bracket syntax, it inherited it from SGML. A DTD is not a schema (and if you want to criticize XML, you should point out that it should <i>not</i> have inherited DTDs from SGML.) He doesn't even mention the worst part about comments, which is that you can't have -- inside a comment (very annoying when commenting a large block of data...)<p>XML has many beautiful applications, like SVG, SMIL (which never took off but keeps getting rediscovered/reimplemented in an inconsistent manner [full disclosure: I participated in the SMIL and CDF W3C working groups]), XSLT, &c.

4863143,comment,4862813,4862813,9,0,scarmig,,,"A sufficiently motivated government has a nearly infinite amount of tools available for breaking encryption. Ignoring the possibility that it might know proprietary weaknesses to various systems (a hypothesis that is unknowable), there's just so much you need to secure at each node in a computer system.<p>Are you personally sure no backdoors exist in the physical hardware you use? In the operating system you use? In the compiler used to build your OS? In any of the applications on your system? Are you sure that there's not a hardware keylogger on your keyboard, and do you check every day before sitting down that there's not one? Are there any secret cameras pointed at your keyboard, or sensitive microphones hidden nearby that can distinguish what keys you hit?<p>And once you're sure of all that, are you just as sure everyone you communicate with is equally diligent?<p>And, while we're at it, have you come up with a solid patch to prevent the well-known rubber hose vulnerability that exists in all cryptographic systems?<p>That doesn't mean the crypto-anarchist project must fail. Encryption is invaluable: while the vast majority of other technological advances--sedentary agriculture, writing, maths, roads, sewage systems, paper, the telegraph, electricity, the light bulb, cars, ""computers,"" satellites, Google--have all increased the legibility of the world to the State, encryption does the opposite. The panopticon isn't an existing, established system but instead an equilibrium point that the State has to constantly push us toward: anytime the economic cost of that push is increased, it gives us more opportunities for creating spaces of genuine human autonomy.<p>But once you recast crypto-anarchism in that more moderate and stronger form, encryption moves from ""our one hope against total domination"" and a ""hope that with courage, insight and solidarity we could use to resist"" to something more banal: one tool of many. Not even a particularly effective tool: governments don't care about a bunch of nerds throwing PGP parties, and all the encryption in the world hasn't prevented the State from throwing Assange into jail (a pleasant jail with some fine Ecuadorian decor, but a jail nonetheless) and obliterating his organization.",1354492017

It's technically easier to do on Android.  On iOS, you're kind of stuck due to the core apps (mail, messages, etc.) being first-party Apple).  It basically would take Apple deciding they cared about this issue, then building it into the OS in a way which didn't actually require trusting Apple completely, to work very well.  Android has some steps toward this with some NSA projects, and wouldn't even necessarily require a full forking.<p>Some way to do tokenization and thus fairly transparent encryption on the client (phone) inside apps like the Facebook App, Twitter, etc. would also be nice.

Indeed, it worth remember that very high-level abstract systems (such as databases) often wind-up simultaneously crunching lots of data in unique ways and thus needs *particular"" sorts of low-level operations along with a variety of high-level constructs.<p>C++ has succeeded as a tool allowing you to do nearly any kind of abstraction up from the low-level operations implicit in c. And given that this is a broad mandate,  the language comes out ""too big"" seeming, ""too wordy"" seeming and so forth. Not a nice language but efforts targeted to a similar area have wound-up making similar compromises and thus having equivalent problems (see the D Language - not that its failure but that it seems to have failed to be lots better than c++). C++ can be ""the best language"" (for its purpose) without being ""a good language"" (without being a pleasant or sane-seeming language).<p>As jandrewrogers said, (at least the best) c++ projects use less than the entire language and use it according to their needs. Merely having good parts is not enough to make a language good but until we have a good alternative to c++ or until we have garbage collectors and virtual machines that are guaranteed to work best for any significant system whatsoever (good luck with that), c++ will have a place.",1354491520

Decriminalization and normalization of cannabis is inevitable. Yes, it's happening at the state level instead of federally, but that's how stuff like this is supposed to work; eventually, the majority of states that empty their holding cells of petty cannabis offenders will bully the remaining states that criminalize it with some a federal law of some sort.<p>It's obvious and banal to point out that there are government actors who oppose legalization. Of course there are. There would have to be, or marijuana would already be legal. But it is not true to suggest that law enforcement uniformly opposes legalization. The law enforcement bodies that tend to actually matter in policy decisions --- state and large urban police forces --- are caving on this issue. They can't afford enforcement anymore.<p>For what it's worth, I do not believe that MDMA and LSD and opiates will be decriminalized.

4862984,comment,4862111,4862504,1,0,thristian,,,"ID/IDREF isn't exactly the same as indirect objects in COS. When you're parsing an XML document, ID/IDREF are just attributes like any other that get added to the DOM, and then application code can dereference them later if it wants. In COS, indirect objects are part of the serialisation format and the parser <i>needs</i> to understand them and dereference them in order to be able to parse the file.<p>For example, the COS ""stream"" object type is serialised as a settings dictionary, followed by the 'stream' keyword, the stream data, and the 'endstream' keyword. But what happens when the stream happens to contain the bytes 'endstream'? Well, the settings dictionary has a ""Length"" key that tells you how long the stream is, without you having to scan for the 'endstream' keyword. However, because most streams are compressed and compression makes it difficult to guess in advance exactly what the compressed size willl be, COS allows you to make the Length key an indirect reference to an integer defined <i>later</i> in the file. Like so:<p><pre><code>    <<\n    % Here, the value associated with the Length key is\n    % indirect object 42 revision 0.\n    /Length 42 0 R\n    /Filter /FlateDecode\n    >>\n    stream\n    ...compressed data goes here...\n    endstream\n    % And now we define object 42 revision 0\n    42 0 obj\n    12345\n    endobj\n</code></pre>\nSo, the parser needs to know the length of the compressed stream in order to parse it, but it needs to have parsed the compressed stream in order to get to the length data. The way out of this catch-22 is the object index at the end of the file, which gives you the index and location of each indirect object. A COS parser needs to start at the end of the file and load all the indirect objects, cache them, then go back to the beginning and stitch them into the deserialised object graph as they're referenced.",1354489774

The way you change basis in linear alebra is by doing a dot product with the basis vectors you want to transform to, and it's no different here... it's just a projection of your single point into fourier basis and that's all the formula says.<p>The fancy e^i stuff is just for mathematical beauty and compactness and should be avoided when explaining the fourier transform, imo.

5696231,comment,5695045,5695045,1,0,somesay,,,"There is no real bad or insecure option. Just make sure the CA is supported by all the platforms / browser you need and that the price is fair. Additionally you may check that their revocation servers have a good internet connection since browsers check these.<p>It is even totally unimportant if your provider is ""insecure"". If any of the commonly trusted CAs is hacked it affects the security of your service as well as if it's the CA you use.<p>Therefore I would go with StartSSL (<a href=""https://www.startssl.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.startssl.com/</a>). They are trusted on all important plattforms, are free for one subdomain per domain and very cheap otherwise. You only pay the verification of your identity, unlimited domains, wildcard etc. then. I haven't seen any cheaper one. You might get some competitive prices if you combine the use of single subdomain ones through SNI, but I wouldn't prefer that over a inexpensive wildcard one.<p>What is the worst that can happen? If the revocation servers go down, the browser just shows a small warning symbol, but everything still works. If your CA gets hacked and untrusted in common browser, you have to buy a cert somewhere else ... this is the risk of every CA and a new cert is just minutes away ...<p>There is no way to determine who is more secure against hacks etc. If they are trusted where you need them, they are all equal.",1368399445

Can't really say he represents all Puritans and is just one example of those that ended up settling in Rhode Island. He also  became a Calvanist/Baptist following his exile to Rhode Island after disagreements with the Puritans in Massachusetts, so he was not exactly a Puritan for long after settling in the New World.

Early man-made versions of these products were inferior, but nowadays we prefer them. Likewise, in-vitro meat is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to taste even better than the most pampered animals today.<p>Somewhere on this planet exists the tastiest cow. It has just the right combination of genes and environment to make it more mouth-watering to us than any other cow. Unfortunately, we won't know it's the tastiest cow until we kill it and eat it. Then only a few people will be able to enjoy it. Offspring with the same diet would likely taste great, but breeding and changing diet will always be an imprecise way to get tasty cows.<p>When fully-developed, in-vitro meat technology will give us better control over every aspect of the meat's taste. Nutrients can be delivered in just the right proportions at just the right times. Exercise (or lack of) can be simulated as much as we want. Even the genes in the tissue can be altered to improve the taste and texture. Once the technology gets to that point, there will be no good reason to raise and eat animals.<p><i>We can all eat /better/, live /better/ and be /better/ without all the trade-offs if we'll put a little more thought into our lives and a have a little more moderation of consumption.

Not only is this annoying, it was completely unnecessary and happened every single time you pulled down the notification shade.\nStock Android also has this widget, by the way. It's called Quick Settings and has more toggles than Samsung (at least in the S3. haven't played with S4 yet) and is customizable. It was also easily accessible by pulling down on the user-specified part of the screen (may have been CM10.1 specific).<p>Notifications in stock Android can also be easily swiped away, same as S3. I don't see how anyone can't figure out which ones are swipable or not. Use your phone, swipe, if it doesn't swipe, then it won't swipe in the future. It's usually things like voicemail or persistent processes that you started.<p>Stock Android should have burst mode as well for the camera.<p>If some of these features don't exist, I apologize. The Cyanogen team may have implemented some of these features on their own, but even so, I hated TouchWiz with every fiber of my being. A refreshed interface comes along with the release of Android 4.0 and Samsung decides to keep the look dated with a Gingerbread-era settings menu. Or the menu button, which should be extinct by now.<p>I'm testing iOS right now, but when I come back to Android, it will be either an HTC running CyanogenMod or Nexus phone for me.",1368398519

Why should anyone take out a loan to get an education? Why would a public university charge tuition? My parents did not take out loans to get college degrees (in California, in the 1960s). But their generation got rich and now doesn't want to pay for the next generation to do the same. Should boomers who attended fully subsidized public education now really be let off the hook with their ridiculous claims that they're some kind of Randian superhero who worked their way up ""on their own"", and it would be ""theft"" to ask them to pay taxes so the same system they benefited from can continue?<p>It's certainly not impossible to do so, if people aren't so stingy.

It's probably going to be harder to get an entry level job at a large publisher if you're not a fresh early 20s graduate.

But hypothetically, suppose you <i>could</i> always be aware of which mode you were editing in? Would modal interfaces still pose the same sorts of problems?<p>I definitely agree with Ilya on his assertion that modal interfaces are bad news when other factors of the situation require you to not pay attention to the interface, for example a car's computer or a mobile phone. I find it incredibly frustrating when the interface I'm forced to use is giving me shit, because it jeopardizes my safety while driving. I've learned over the years when to just ""put it down"", and to always have backup CD music in my car in case my lovely iPhone which can play any track ever made (if I have a decent LTE connection) decides that it's just not going to do that today. In most situations, it seems that a modal or even timed-modal user interface is not what you want, and certainly not the most efficient use of brainpower for your device.<p>On the other hand, given that someone <i>is</i> aware of his mode at all times, modal interfaces do give an extraordinary level of efficiency to even simple interfaces. Ilya's ""TV Remote"" analogy is a perfect example of this. A remote isn't something you need to use while in motion, nor is it typically something that is lunged for, grabbed, and acted upon very quickly as a response to something insane happening around you (like a gun, for example). I think it would be preferred to have a remote with less buttons and more modes, with very clear ways of knowing which mode you're in. The vim-powerline plugin (for my favorite text editor) is a perfect example of this, I can know what mode I'm in simply by being aware of the color of the bottom bar in Vim. It would require devices with far less complexity, instead of needing a dedicated control for each and every action you take.<p>I think Native Instruments' MASCHINE, a groovebox and hardware/software production studio, does a very good job with this. There are few times, except early on, where you are unaware of which mode you are in. It was designed for live performance as well as home studio usage, so its interface is very simple, yet very complex at the same time. It has dedicated controls for parts of the song that always need to be adjustable (for example, volume/tempo/swing control), and defaults to ""performance mode"" where the easiest thing to do right off the bat is start banging out beats or melodies. There are other ""edit modes"" which let you write new parts in a step sequencer, record live beat mashing or sample-fuckery, and adjust effect processing for damn near everything, but access to these modes require a level of ""intent"", wherein you need to definitely know you're in that mode. It's also very easy to see when you're in a given mode, because the dual LCD interface is so simple that it's very easy to tell that you're in the wrong place.<p>Wow, that was a lot. Sorry if it's a big mash of paragraphs but I really am fascinated with UI and UX creation.",1368398241

OWS was indeed shut down by municipalities using tough and even exceptional tactics, but the fact that it could be was a sign of deeper problems.<p>I think it's important to keep in mind the distinctions between broader social moods, specific organizations, and tactics, all of which together make up a social movement.<p>The American Civil Rights movement is an interesting comparison point, because it's a social movement that met with some success and is pretty well-known. It had organizations like SNCC and the SCLC that organically grew from a broader social base--the burgeoning black middle class, well-educated liberal whites--that gave it staying power. And it was able to rationally coordinate specific tactics that went beyond pushing legal briefs and went toward crystallizing specific instances of the injustices of the South. To make a retronym, it could Occupy the front section in public buses and seats at restaurants. And the power of those actions is that it would force governments to either react against them, revealing the profound violence involved in the system, or show that the government was unwilling to enforce its laws, which would effectively repeal them. (This is all very stylized, of course.) And individual tactics could and did coalesce into an organizational strategy, which is the key point.<p>How does OWS compare? You definitely have the discontent and the social base for it. And you have the tactics. God, you have more tactics than you can count. New forms of government, a bold attempt to force governments to instantiate violence by throwing your bodies in an area you'd live in and occupy, crews of people who, in a matter of weeks, managed to construct some level of waste management and food provision.<p>But, if you remove the people from the area they've Occupied... all those tactics fall apart. If you pull out that keystone, the whole logic of it crumbles. And then all you are left with is the original generalized discontent.<p>I think it would be very fair to lay the blame for that at Occupy's doorstep, if Occupy had a doorstep. Building a movement out of a tactic and social malaise leaves you vulnerable to the fact that as soon as anyone finds a way to respond to the tactic, the movement dies on the vine.",1368397130

Dirty black rags being used repeatedly to dry plates at restaurants. Idlys being cooked on plastic sheets inside hot streamers. Infernoes of uncollected trash burning on streets. Rats and cockroaches everywhere including your toothbrush at night.<p>2) Utterly horrifying road conditions. Potholes large enough to cause motorcycle crashes every 100 feet. A culture of not giving the other motorist more than 6 inches on any side. Driving on the wrong side of the road, including on highways. It's incredibly stressful to think about your odds when you leave the house.<p>3) A political system that no-one is optimistic about. Stories are rampant of politicians buying votes by giving free household appliances away to the poor, and then doing nothing in office to help them.<p>4) An education system that isn't remotely good enough. Miserable professors, antiquated curriculums that churn out the IT coolies we're so famous for.<p>5) Congestion so bad you hardly ever leave a 5-mile radius. People tend to hang out based on which neighborhood they live in, because a trip to a friend's place more than 5 miles away can turn into an hour-long slog on terrifying roads.<p>6) A culture of being cheap. If you're only willing to tip your waiter 10 rupees, it may help out your savings rate, but it certainly won't help the waiter buy his kid a computer someday. Same goes for our beloved household servants, who get paid $150 per month at best, $40 at worst to clean our floors.<p>But to voice a conflict that everyone who lives here talks about, I'm not a pessimist about India by any means, because it's amazing how much the people of this country have achieved through individual hard work in the face of so many poor institutions.",1368396626

Apple Maps may have less quality data but has a much better UI and uses a lot less data. Google Now is pointless compared to the genuinely useful Android version. Chrome is slower in most cases than Safari and not integrated with the rest of the OS. And really all their other apps simply aren't popular.<p>Unfortunately Apple just doesn't give third party apps any room to expand beyond its tiny little sandbox.",1368396086

There's always an uproar about how there's a distinct lack of women in science and tech, so it's good that this trip helped them alter their ideas about what and <i>who</i> a scientist could be.<p>We still live in an age, though, where kids can go for a while through school with only hearing about Madame Curie and a few others (Magaret Meade, Jane Goodall, Sally Ride, Mae Jemison, etc.) as women scientists.  Not taking anything away from them, but efforts to change that are always nice (both for boys and girls).  I can remember being in quiz bowl at that age and knowing that anytime the moderator asked a question mentioning a female scientist, the ladies above were the likely answers.",1277668717
1466112,comment,1465641,1465641,0,0,pdx,,,"I married my ex-wife from eharmony.  (thanks for the compatibility match guys!)  I married my current wife, and the mother of my two children, using yahoo personals.  I also dated using match.com<p>In my opinion, dating sites are still extremely efficient ways of meeting people.  I exclude eharmony, both from personal bias, and from the fact that they don't allow you to really search the database.<p>After you leave college, real life meetings become much more complicated.  The bar scene is a lottery.  How likely is it that you'll actually coincide in time and space with somebody who you would be happy with, and then how likely is it that you'll even get to talk to them if they are there when you're there?  Grocery stores and other non-traditional meeting places, I personally avoided bothering women in, assuming there should be some neutral ground where a woman might wish to be left alone.<p>For me, I wanted college educated women who had opinions about politics and whose opinions I shared.  I wanted women with no children, who lived within 50 miles of me and didn't smoke or do drugs, but who did drink socially, wanted children, had traveled the world some, and were not strongly religious.  I wanted women who enjoyed outdoor sports such as scuba, skydiving, and rock climbing.  I wanted women who didn't own small yap dogs.<p>Can you imagine bumping into women like this randomly?  But with a dating site, it became so much easier.<p>I still went out on a lot of dates that were bad matches, but I definitely skewed my chances of finding somebody I could respect and have fun with by taking the random chance aspect out of the equation.<p>EDIT: The article doesn't actually disagree with this.  It's saying that paid dating sites will lose out to unpaid.  I was responding to the HN title which derides all dating sites.",1277668656

Testing and speed. Here are a few tips..this advice isn't really making any assumptions about you..it mostly is a result of mistakes I've made and have seen other guys make.<p>Testing:<p>-Photos: ask friends to help pick the best ones, take some new ones, use OKCupid's photo-testing service, etc.<p>-Profile: I probably went through 5 complete rewrites, followed by a lot of constant tweaking. I think the biggest mistake most guys make is being way too serious in their profile. You've really got to keep it light and playful. Sure, be authentic and show who you are, but wait until after a few dates before getting all deep. Just have fun.<p>-Messages: Play around with the type of message you sent. Try some serious, try some playful, try some ridiculous/absurd. You'll see what tends to work more. I'm assuming you're doing more than just saying ""hey what's up,"" that will just get you ignored.<p>Speed:<p>Don't write long messages implying you think you two are soulmates. The worst thing you can do is get hung up on hoping this one person with a great profile will reply. Getting into this kind of pattern will make you think way too hard about what to write to them for your first message. Look for interesting profiles, write a quick message, move on. You've got to get a good volume of messages out there, don't spend too much time on a particular profile.<p>EDIT: Forgot to mention one more thing, take it offline as soon as possible.

It's good for maintaining relationships, not so good for starting them.<p>I've noticed a bunch of friends either getting married or beginning serious LTRs after meeting online, though.  They usually fall into two categories.<p>1. A set of mutual friends of them say ""Hey, you two would be perfect for each other,"" introduce them, and then the relationship blooms through FaceBook or old-fashioned e-mail.<p>2. They're both participants at a ""niche"" online forum or social networking site, and then end up meeting in person eventually and take it from there.<p>I think the latter situation is way, way underreported.  We pay attention to the big social sites like FaceBook and Twitter and the big dating sites like eHarmony and Match, but there's an enormous long-tail of niche sites that toss up a website and a forum and build a community.  You can find a fansite for virtually every celebrity, every TV show, every sport, many of the more popular books, and even niche professional interests like startups and programming language design.  Many of these grow very close, tight-knit communities, and when those communities are of mixed gender, it's very common for some dating to occur.<p>Heck, if HN weren't overwhelming male, I bet we'd see some Hacker News couples.  There've already been a bunch of ""Founder Dating"" sites spun off from it.",1277666961

This works for some stuff (hard drives), but it's still a big waste if you want to get a faster (GPU, CPU) iMac, but would be perfectly fine with your existing display. At least used Macs sell at a reasonable price…<p>And Mac Pros aren't consumer machines. They might look like medium to high grade desktop PCs, but Apple tends to see them more as the successor to SGIs and Sun workstations.<p>The problem is: Is there a real demand for a mid-range desktop? Even the normal market is migrating towards laptops. And they have the advantage that the power users see them as more disposable than laptops anyway, despite the price premium, and that even low-performance models are a good value for those that don't need the speed.<p>The only possible exception where I'd see some money coming it would be gamers. Steam is porting more and more games, so there'd actually be some usage scenarios, and the Mac hardware landscape isn't unified enough (GPU and CPU-wise) so that developers could gain much by optimizing one path only (as done with gaming consoles). But alas, the usual home-built gaming PC is almost on par with a Mac Pro anyway (or even superior), so what would Apple sell for that? And they wouldn't earn a lot from upgrades, as those are sold by third parties.<p>So as much as I'd like to see a bigger product palette from Apple, I certainly understand the reason why they're doing it like this. And it seems to work for them.<p>The bigger problem is that we don't have a good desktop hardware market anyway. There's no real competition. Linux doesn't sell hardware (in that range), there's no IBM/HP/Sun/SGI/Apollo Unix market, there's no Amiga, Atari or Be anymore.

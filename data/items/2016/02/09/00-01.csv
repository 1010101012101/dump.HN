Every single time, without fail, within those first couple days I hit some sort of show-stopping bug. Sometimes the installer wouldn&#x27;t work and I&#x27;d spend that time cycling through different disk tools / CDR drives / images. Sometimes the installer would run but repeatedly lock up at a certain step. Some times it would corrupt the partition map and never boot into the new install. Some times the installed OS would freeze on boot. Some times it would boot but I could only use external keyboard and mice. Some times linux came up but wifi, sound, or sleep were broken. Or the screen was locked at full or zero brightness. Or the UI was dirt slow because the graphics drivers were crap. Or... the list goes on. I&#x27;d find threads in forums filled with dozens of people with the same issue, trying increasingly desperate measures to work around them, almost never with any sort of success or even conclusion.<p>I never managed to get a non-VM linux install fully functioning. Once I graduated the end-of-semester ritual faded into the past and I stopped trying. I&#x27;ve recently had good experiences with bootable USB images, maybe I should give it another chance one of these days.<p>> KDE circa 2003.

I&#x27;d rather walk into the Apple store and replace my MBA or my iPhone when I&#x27;ve got a problem.<p>I don&#x27;t get the comparison.<p>It&#x27;s like apple users think the only options are buy apple (expensive, but &quot;allegedly&quot; rarely needs fixing, works 99% of the time, lasts a long time, etc) and a PC (&quot;allegedly&quot; breaks all the time, requires more maintenance, requires more time to keep up with, &quot;cheap&quot;, etc...)<p>Those are not the options -- it&#x27;s a false premise. There are laptop PCs which have the exact same performance & reliability as apple, but for a fraction of the price. I&#x27;ve gone through 4 PC laptops since 1996. My first 2 laptops, I admit, I spent a lot of time repairing but that was due to my own youthful tinkering, experimenting and the general instability of earlier OSs (DOS, Win95, Win98/ME, etc).<p>But my last 2 have lasted me 7+ years a piece. And I only decided to upgrade because they were beginning to show their age (slower compared to newer stuff). You <i>can</i> buy PC laptops with the same &quot;just works&quot; fidelity as apple.

The trends this article identified are largely true, but the speculations are not accurate or to the point, as other comments have pointed out.<p>I&#x27;ve been wondering about this phenomenon too, and here are some hypotheses:\n- As someone who&#x27;s fluent in both languages, I find Chinese text much more skimmable than English. Chinese is a compact language, and you make sense of it by recognizing the shape of characters, which is much easier than recognizing long combinations of letters. It&#x27;s not too bad to skim a wall of Chinese text to find the information you want. Though this could be biased by the fact that Chinese is my native language.<p>- Cities in China, as well as Japan, are densely populated. If you walk on the streets, all kinds of visual stimuli come at you: flashing ads, colorful banners, a lot of people in various styles etc. It seems we grow up being used to dense visuals, compared to say, Americans who grew up in the spread-out suburbs.<p>- Most people in China are not design-minded. The most popular post on Zhihu (Chinese equivalent of Quora) in 2015 discusses the general design and aesthetics level in China, why our streets are so ugly with all the poorly-designed banners etc. We don’t have a tradition of recognizing the importance of design, or developing a sense of good design. Japan, on the contrary, has a much longer tradition on that. Therefore, people are much more likely to live with poor web designs, and companies are not incentivized to redesign.",1454978550

When I draw that 1 kWh, the utility loses 2 cents on average. But they also saved 8 cents by selling my kWh to the neighbor. The summing works like this:<p>10 from my neighbor to the utility\n0 from me to the utility\n-10 for the utility to provide me that kWh\n8 to the utility for avoiding the cost of generating and distributing the 1 kWh that went from my system to the neighbor.<p>The net to the utility is 8 cents.

If that is the case, they are already losing 2 cents for every on-peak kWh they are selling me but making up for it with off-peak (I am likely to use more off-peak anyhow).<p>In this case, netting might look like the following:<p>10 from my neighbor to the utility\n0 from me to the utility\n-8 for the utility to provide me an off-peak kWh\n11 to the utility for avoiding the cost of generating and distributing the 1 kWh that went from my system to the neighbor.<p>The net to the utility in this case is 13 cents.<p>13 cents is better than 8 cents but it is worse than the 20 cents they would have made if I just consumed without generating.<p>Whether you credit at wholesale or do a .75-1 netmetering or whatever depends on evaluating the stranded costs and whether they are reasonable.

11062118,comment,11056986,11061656,0,0,sago,,,"> Scientists can study the function of sacrality, but I don&#x27;t think science can make claims of sacrality.<p>What&#x27;s a claim of sacrality? A claim that a particular set of behavior is concerned with the sacred is, as your second paragraph implied, an unremarkable claim. No more impressive that claiming some behavior is religious, or ritualistic.<p>This is where I&#x27;m struggling to understand you. Something is sacred, in the context of religious studies, if it is something set apart by a community and held deliberately in contrast with profane activities (following the Durkheim kind of definition - the older definition of folks like Otto is well out of favour now). To identify that certain activities, knowledge, experience, or behavior is commonly sacred, is just an observation about how communities organise their worldviews.<p>In a certain sense, no discussion of religion can be secular, by definition (religious and secular are as slippery to define precisely as sacred and profane). But in the sense that you can do secular religious studies, I don&#x27;t know why &#x27;sacred&#x27; for you is a special kind of topic that can&#x27;t be admitted to the rest of the field.<p>On the &#x27;people studying this go weird&#x27; tack. Yup! Very true. I think this is an issue with religious studies generally, and lots of related fields (biblical criticism, say). The people who are attracted to a field are probably more likely to have some affinity for what they are studying, and sometimes language can get a little to &#x27;emic&#x27; for my taste. One does have to be careful to distinguish between the views someone will advocate and the positions they want to put forward as a scientist, or a secular scholar. Though sometimes people will blur those boundaries. Mind you, I get the same feeling from scientists and scholars with strong ideological opinions generally, not just religious folks. But all that said, the term &#x27;sacred&#x27; is not unscientific that I can see, or at least, no more than any other term used to describe human religious activity.",1454978182

This is true for the inputs, as well as any interim variables computed while the\ncode is evaluated. An observant reader would notice that as a function is evaluated from inputs to\noutputs, the interim results generally become less descriptive and more aggregative.<p>For simple functions or functions involving very few inputs, this may not hold true, but since these\nfunctions are fast to compute - no additional steps are needed.<p>However, for computationally expensive functions, involving many lines of code and a large number\nof inputs, we can dynamically reduce the number computing nodes as we progress, instead of having\na fixed n for the entire function evaluation process. Specifically, we design a feed-forward network\n(Figure 5) that propagates results from inputs to outputs. The original code is reorganized so that we\nprocess addition gates on the inputs first, followed by processing multiplication gates. The interim\nresults are then secret-shared with N/c nodes, and the process is repeated recursively.</i>",1454977447

This means that an application process may send a write request, and it may reach the storage server a minute later when the lease has already expired.&quot;<p>This statement confused me. It seems to say that the packets were delayed in the network for 90 seconds before being delivered. From reading the original sources it actually sounds like packets were discarded by the switches, so the original requests discarded, and the nodes were partitioned for 90 seconds. When the partition was removed both nodes thought they were the leader and simultaneously requested the other to shutdown. Can anyone confirm? Keeping packets delayed in a network for 90 seconds would seem quite difficult (though not impossible assuming certain bugs).<p>Edit: On re-reading I think this is just talking about the network stack in general - not the network.

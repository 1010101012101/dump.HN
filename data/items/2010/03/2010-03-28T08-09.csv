1224367,comment,1223867,1224126,0,0,swombat,,,"That's a very typical use case, actually. If you're on a phone or Skype call and you catch yourself saying stuff like ""You see that link on the page, third one from the right at the top? Yes, the blue one, not the magenta one. Can we move it to right beneath the bit of text next to the picture of a monkey?"" try firing up Woobius Eye instead. You'll then be able to just say ""Can we move this link here?"" Much more efficient conversation, and allows multiple sides to join in easily.",1269766738

A leaderboard ranking your connections is an idiotic idea.<p><i>Having more friends generally equates to greater personal satisfaction with Facebook and in real life</i><p>This is the case only because the Facebook accounts of real users are actually a reflection of their real-life social networks. Those who are happy and outgoing in real life are likely to have larger networks of friends and acquiantances, which results in more Facebook friends. They do not ""friend"" random people, nor do they ""make"" friends on Facebook.",1269765955

1224359,comment,1223778,1224329,0,0,rajat,,,"No, it's more than just not needing the things. For example, I'm involved with a startup right now and the founders needed a decent amount for ongoing expenses until VC and angel funding can be arranged. Well, I can provide that money very quickly (for stock that I hope will be worth a lot more at some point) since I'm very involved and a lot of due diligence is not required. My first startup was self-funded with several other founders; that meant coming up with a pretty sizeable amount of money up front to get the company started (there were hardware components involved), and then go for a long period of time with absolutely no income.<p>Independence to take action means also being able to afford to take that action; not just that you can learn to avoid expenses.",1269765679

1224357,comment,1224320,1224353,0,0,pkc,,,"Hi Cubible67,<p>Thanks for the feedback. Yeah you are right. App and diagram are not polished. I put up quickly something that gives a feel of what I am thinking and get feedback is there really need for such thing. Surely I will consider all of your points and put up more polished one in some time. All of them are valid points except for interaction consistency. When you go deeper into Network you see ""Virtual File System"" which a sub component of Network. Double clicking on ""Virtual File System"" should take you to internal details of VFS. But they are none of details as far the diagram is considered. So it won't do anything.<p>Note: Indicating which of them are clickable is a very valid point. Will try to incorporate it in some time.",1269765220
1224356,comment,1219527,1222338,0,0,bmelton,,,"I'm not crazy about the logo; It isn't bad, but it does look like a (really good) layman's attempt at creating a logo.  I (also a developer) have the same exact problem, in that I come up with a 'good enough' logo and usually stick with it for longer than I should have.  People LIKE logos, and honestly, if we could have a nickel for every time an inferior product won market share due to a better logo, we'd probably both be rich.<p>The ""Questions, People, Ask a Question"" are kind of the same way.  The white font looks a little off -- I might try a slightly softer off-white color, but it also makes them stand out.  A more experienced UI guy could tell you more about it, certainly.<p>The login and signup aren't nearly prominent enough, I think.  I had a hard time finding them.  If I played with the app more, I might discover that you've solved the problem by prompting for login/registration on actions, which is where I think they ought to be, or something, but they're also a little blah.<p>Lastly (and this is actually parallel to the adwords, but I'm throwing it in because you asked) the double-turn-down effect on the search just bugs me. I don't know why.  If it were rounded on both ends, I'd probably be fine.  If they turned in opposite directions (ala Digg) I'd probably be fine.  It also doesn't scream 'search' to me either.<p>These might be the amateurish ramblings of a novice UI guy, so take them all with a grain of salt, but I'd at least try to get some consultation with somebody with more experience.<p>I really do love the layout, so please don't take any offense.  I only say because you asked, and I really think the overall design is nice, even if you hadn't said you weren't a designer.  The colors work, the transition from blue to white in the content layer is solid.  The wraparound labels on the informational boxes may as well be gold-plated.  The 'answers' and 'votes' buttons are splendid too. Like I said, I like it.",1269765143

It is primarily used for client-side scripting for web applications. While that's not the only thing it's used for, if you had some other specific use in mind, you'd probably be mentioning it.<p>You ask if it's essential to learn HTML. Well, you're talking about languages that are typically used for web development, and HTML is the final product these things spit out and send to the user. Given that, HTML seems like a very strange thing to try and intentionally keep in a knowledge blind spot.<p>Your post sounds like you're looking to pad out a resume with specific things, and you don't really understand yet what those things are. I apologize if that assumption is in error, but if it's true, there's really nothing wrong with that.<p>But I would suggest, rather than trying to maintain that HTML blind spot, you actually start there. Pick up a copy of ""Head First HTML with CSS"". Then pick up the brilliant Douglas Crockford book on Javascript mentioned by another replier.

1224353,comment,1224320,1224320,0,0,cubicle67,,,"yes, I think there's a need for this type of diagram. Reminds me of LabView from many years ago.<p>some quick feedback:<p>- Could do with some sort of feedback to indicate what can be clicked on and what can't. I jumped in (to the demo) early without reading your instructions, and had to click on everything to see what responded and what didn't. It looks like brown boxes with square corners are clickable. Completely missed the double click option.<p>- The scrolly bit on the dialog that pops up is horrible :) (Unresponsive, hard to hit, doesn't really look like a scrollbar etc)<p>- There's a bit of naming inconsistency going on between being in the top view, and in a sub view. From the top view, it looks like there's 3 main processes; File System on the left, Process Scheduler in the centre and Network on the right. When I enter Network, I'd expect to see the box it connects to called Process Scheduler, but instead I get Virtual File System. Where's the process Scheduler gone? Same with the sub view on the left.<p>- Interaction is also inconsistent. From the top view I double click a box to enter it, but the same action doesn't work on boxes within that view; instead I need to click Back (which I didn't notice for some time). When I'm looking at the Network Interface view, it looks like the Virtual File System is the same type of widget, but it isn't<p>- Oh, and you might want to get rid of the generic Rails 404 page :)",1269764665

I don't even know how they teach math to kids these days but I would probably think it was completely foolish.  Apparently they changed the way they teach spelling and vocabulary and I think the new method is complete nonsense.<p>But the point of the article is that the current mantra seems to be that if 'kids aren't good at math in grade X' then 'teach even more math at grade X-1', which has diminishing returns when you start getting down to kindergarten and such.",1269764112

1224342,comment,1222912,1222966,0,0,Qz,,,"I agree with you, even though math was never a problem for me.<p>Another factor that could play into this is the learned frustration that comes with the increasing force of the teaching attempts.  Some people might be bad at math when they're young, but then because it gets pushed on them so much they then acquire a personal dislike for the subject, so even if later they might be in a spot where they could learn the subject easily, they'll still have in their head that they suck at math and don't like it.

It wasn't until Gandhi came along and somehow got the British press to pay attention that the British public was aghast and shamed by what they saw.

Colonialism died when the rulers couldn't stand the actions taken in their name to maintain their rule.<p>What's happening in Africa has happened all over the world, at times even in the U.S. It happens whenever access to certain resources brings in so much money that the government is overwhelmed.

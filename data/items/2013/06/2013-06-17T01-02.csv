5890969,comment,5890673,5890673,21,0,gojomo,,,"The phrasing &quot;without legal authorization&quot; is the superhighway-sized qualifier which lets anything through, here. Of course they consider everything they do to be &#x27;legally authorized&#x27;, under their own strained interpretations that are hidden from others&#x27; review and challenge, and which include things like provisional authorizations that don&#x27;t require a warrant.<p>We know they consider any calls known to be &#x27;foreign&#x27; already legally authorized. No warrant needed, little reporting, little oversight.<p>Then, anything else that they guess with 51% confidence is foreign, until they discover otherwise, is also authorized: they can start listening, before they have a warrant, and perhaps never needing one. Operating in secrecy, there are a number of ways they could have their fingers on the 51% scales, here: nudging a few extra algorithmic signals into the analysis until they hit the 51% threshold, or pretending not to hear any other indicators of domesticness. (A US citizen might want to answer all calls not with &quot;hello&quot; but instead &quot;I am a US person&quot;, if you want them to stop listening... though from the myriad of reports, it&#x27;s not certain that the enforcement is much stronger than an analyst-self-reported &quot;honor system&quot; and &quot;oops, I&#x27;ll try not to do that again&quot;.)<p>But then also, multiple reports seem to indicate they can <i>start listening</i> to <i>previously-recorded believed US person calls</i> with merely the intent to pursue a FISA warrant within the next 7 days. What if they start that and get more evidence to push the foreignness-confidence over 51%? Perhaps no warrant application is then necessary. What if they use their 6 days and 23 hours of listening and then decide, false lead? Does this &quot;free look at anyone for any reason&quot; have any cost for the analyst? (Was it this sort of temporary-unilateral-overreach that let an analyst access stored intercepts of former President Bill Clinton&#x27;s email in 2009?

How many developers in SF make that kind of money? Even in the HN demographic, it&#x27;s got to be a very, very small number. Yet I could easily afford a median-priced Houston home on my starting salary out of college. I choose to rent just because I enjoy walking to work.<p>Anyway, strictly speaking the best strategy might be to go to SF for some of your twenties, live a crappy life but save like crazy, and then come somewhere more cost effective and buy a house, maybe also using your higher SF income to negotiate a higher wage here as well.",1371433822

After going back and forth with a contractor for over 5 months attempting to satisfy their never ending demand for extra paperwork, we got a letter from the bank saying we were eligible, but because the contractor did not send our phone number in the package to the bank, we had been denied. After a couple more months of back and forth and escalating complaints through the bank hierarchy, we actually ended up getting a modification that, while not perfect, still reduced our interest rate dramatically.  The notary from the bank said that almost nobody actually gets the modification - she said that our 9 month turn-around was the quickest she had heard of, most people just give up after the first rejection.<p>I am sure that a sincere investigation into BoA&#x27;s practices would reveal systematic denials of some sort, so this article doesn&#x27;t really surprise me at all.

Were you all really unaware the NSA did things like this or PRISM? I mean really? You don&#x27;t have to be a conspiracy theorist to be this naive. I find the shock and indignation over this news a little over the top. I&#x27;m not defending it or anything and I&#x27;m not saying it is not an important issue ... but really you never knew or suspected this before?

This is insufferable. Here is a short list of cities on which I have read articles in the past 6 months claiming that they are the next Silicon Valley or something to that effect:<p>-NYC<p>-Berlin<p>-Ljubljana<p>-Chicago<p>-Detroit<p>-San Diego<p>-LA<p>-Toronto<p>-Dubai<p>-Tel Aviv<p>-Nairobi<p>...<p>This isn&#x27;t news. Yes, believe it or not, most cities with a few hundred thousand people in them have a tech scene! (Especially the ones with a University housing a major CS department --- like Seattle!) Yes, it is 2014 --- the tech scene is mostly booming wherever you look, especially on a sufficiently long-term perspective.  Really, articles of this sort are usually just self-serving advertisement for the city in question.<p>The truth is, of course, that the tech scene in most of these cities is <i>not really</i> booming in the sense of the word. Developing strongly is often a better way to put it, and the growth rate is often non-linear (probably more toward the logarithmic side of things) because founders of successful companies have a tendency to move to the Bay Area.",1402570604

It&#x27;s essentially the same, functionally, as a password you remember. Except passwords are less secure, as people use the same ones repeatedly, or generate them from a simple system repeatedly (less vulnerable to automated password guessing attempts, but as vulnerable to a dedicated human attacker).<p>Are their web frameworks that let you determine if a user is genuine by their behaviour as much as their passwords?

In an ACL system, the list of authorized principals is attached to the resource.  Thus, sharing access to a resource requires updating the resource.  For instance, if Alice creates a document and wants to share it with Bob, then Bob needs an account and Alice needs to add Bob to the document&#x27;s ACL.  In a capability system, the capabilities designate the resource and sharing the resource is as simple as copying the capability.  In fact, Bob can also share the document (without copying it first) with Carol.  In an ACL system, Bob would not typically have permission to update the ACL.<p>For more information about capabilities, start with, for instance, the e-rights wiki at <a href=""http://erights.org/elib/capability/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://erights.org/elib/capability/index.html</a> .",1402570451

Look at the internet comics and then look at what people were doing from 1900 up to WW2. They were working with full newspaper pages at times so they were making more use of space than most webcomics. They also had much larger audiences. Ridiculously larger. Tens of millions of fans. Rube Goldberg received a contract to work exclusively for one paper that I think paid around $50000 a year... in the 1910s. The fact that you&#x27;re talking about crowdfunding at all is a reminder of how far comics have fallen; comics as an independent underground thing is taken for granted now, and crowdfunding is(while incredibly useful) frequently a way to  squeeze as much support as is possible from a small audience. The options for that comic market are much better than they were, but the market taking the shape that it has is precisely because of its falling popularity. The equation of superheroes with comic books was similar; in the dying comic book  market, superheroes were one genre that survived, but even that survival was fought for in the form of specialty shops for fans; the mainstream support was already lost and the characters maintained popular support through other media like cartoons and films.",1402568522

It&#x27;s apparently impossible to prove this, because the fact of women expressing a dislike for CS and not choosing to major in it is assumed to be problematic on the face and self-evident proof of bias and discrimination. It&#x27;s a bad idea to even openly suggest the possibility. But consider, as a thought experiment, what the world might look like if there truly existed a preference among women for some school subjects and against certain other subjects, among them CS. It would probably look a lot like the world we are in. Now consider whether it&#x27;s implausible that a difference in subject preferences could exist between men and women. It doesn&#x27;t seem all that implausible to me. If my statistics are up to date, women are now attending college at a slightly higher rate than men. Since women make up a huge presence on college campuses, you might expect that if large numbers of women were interested in CS, but faced bias, there would be more of a grass-roots movement to bring attention to the subject. But, instead, the interest seems to be coming from researchers looking at statistics, not students with personal stories of discrimination. To me, the fact that women have entered equally-prestigious fields like biology and medicine with great success is evidence against the idea that women are being relegated to study less challenging subjects and settle for careers that are not intellectually demanding. I am skeptical that the lack of a 50/50 split between men and women in some technical subjects is evidence of a problem that needs a solution.",1402568401

I was just surprised to see the license of a software where &quot;GNU&quot; is in the title. I naturally assumed that it will be in GNU license. So it was a surprise to discover MIT.<p>Now I understand. I should have written &quot;surprising&quot; instead of &quot;funny&quot;.

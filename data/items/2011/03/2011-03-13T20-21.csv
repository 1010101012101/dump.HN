The code may not be the prettiest, it may not have proper comments and it may not be robust capable of handling everything thrown at it. It may have a few known bugs, it may not even be fully complete. In such a case is it still good to put these products up in public view even though they are not of amazing quality(maybe not even your best work)? or is it better to keep them private? I ask because I see it both ways. Employers would likely want to know you have done something, but then once they see that they can read your code, see you didn't handle every exception to perfection and write you off as a lazy idiot.",1300049941

2320172,comment,2319118,2319118,0,0,aaroniba,,,"Cofounder and former CEO of EtherPad here.  I appreciate your kind words about our product.  Allow me to clarify some aspects of the story.<p>First, we knew etherpad was more than a toy.  We knew people were using it for real work.  We had paying customers and thousands of dollars a month in revenue.  (Not a lot of revenue, but decent evidence that etherpad was more than a toy).<p>Second, the relationship between etherpad and appjet is much different from how you characterize it.  AppJet was a <i>failing</i> idea.  We had like no users.  We had spent over a year building this developer platform and we had practically zero developers actually using it.  It clearly wasn't working.  We were <i>ecstatic</i> when etherpad took off.  After etherpad took off, we shut down appjet.com and focused our entire company on etherpad.  appjet.com redirected to etherpad.com.  It felt great to have a product that people were actually using!<p>Third, we never thought the Wave product was better than the etherpad product.  However, the Wave vision was pretty awesome.  Lars' narrative excited a lot of people when he delivered the announcement at Google IO '09.  When we met with him, we were dazzled by his vision and the team's optimism.  Perhaps we were naive.<p>The decision to sell to Google was one of the toughest decisions I and my cofounders ever had to wrestle with in our lives.  We were excited by the Wave vision though we saw the flaws in the product.  The Wave team told us about how they wanted our help making wave simpler and more like etherpad, and we thought we could help with that, though in the end we were unsuccessful at making wave simpler.  We were scared of Google as a competitor: they had more engineers and more money behind this project, yet they were running it much more like an independent startup than a normal big-company department.  The Wave office was in Australia and had almost total autonomy.  And finally, after 1.5 years of being on the brink of failure with AppJet, it was tempting to be able to declare our endeavor a success and provide a decent return to all our investors who had risked their money on us.<p>In the end, our decision to join Wave did not work out as we had hoped.  The biggest lessons learned were that having more engineers and money behind a project can actually be more harmful than helpful, so we were wrong to be scared of Wave as a competitor for this reason.  It seems obvious in hindsight, but at the time it wasn't.  Second, I totally underestimated how hard it would be to iterate on the Wave codebase.  I was used to rewriting major portions of software in a single all-nighter.  Because of the software development process Wave was using, it was practically impossible to iterate on the product.  I should have done more diligence on their specific software engineering processes, but instead I assumed because they seemed to be operating like a startup, that they would be able to iterate like a startup.  A lot of the product problems were known to the whole Wave team, but we were crippled by a large complex codebase built on poor technical choices and a cumbersome engineering process that prevented fast iteration.<p>I'm grateful for the many lessons learned through the whole experience.  And I'm hopeful that the same software engineering and product skills that produced etherpad, combined with the many valuable lessons learned through the Google acquisition, will be able to produce even better products in the future.  My cofounder David Greenspan and I have both left Google, so we are not, as you say, stuck in the vortex.<p>If you have more specific questions, I'd be happy to provide additional clarification.",1300049013

Now they get to take all of Countrywide's losses, both financially and in terms of public relationships.  <i>Countrywide</i> didn't misbehave, <i>Bank of America Corporation</i> did, because Countrywide is defunct.

I graduated from the University of Michigan three years ago with a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Michigan and a 3.5 gpa.  After college I got an amazing job opportunity in a rotation program at Intel, the mecca for aspiring computer architects and I had the world at my finger tips.<p>Fast forward two years: the rotation program had come to an end and I had come to the conclusion that working on hardware wasn't what I thought it was and what I really wanted to do is software.

I've been going to Meetups, meeting other developers, and making as many connections as I can.  I am happy to report that I just quit my job last week and am starting at a startup working on Ruby and Rails full time in a couple weeks.<p>Find interesting new technologies that you are excited about and start building something outside of work.

2320153,comment,2319983,2319983,0,0,rbarooah,,,"While generally a reasonable point of view, which I'm not really contradicting there are a couple of points worth mentioning:<p>1. Eliminating the keyboard dock makes sense just because the Bluetooth keyboard is <i>a much better solution</i>.  I just put my iPad on a book stand when I use it, but Apple's regular dock would do as a stand.  I don't use the keyboard that much - really only when I have a long email to write, or some text to write that I want to capture while it's in my head, but when I do it's vital.<p>2. Pages and numbers are actually quite popular on the App Store.  Maybe that's because people haven't figured out that they aren't going to use them but I'm not so sure.  I don't have a computer at home anymore, and occasionally I need to print letters (e.g. To the bank, to landlords, etc.). For this kind of light usage, Pages and an AirPrint printer work very well.  For <i>domestic</i> use that's really all most people need.  But without pages or an equivalent I simply wouldn't be able to do this.<p>So a less sweeping view is that doing light office tasks is actually very important for the iPad to be viable.  It's just that it's solved now and the keyboard dock isn't needed.",1300048418

We would get banned all the time, and have to spend another few hundred for a beta invite.  When WOW was released, in the few short months before Blizzard exhausted all the hacks we'd found, we were buying, on average, a new copy of the game per day, for each of us.<p>The challenge was awesome.  Some of the hacks were brilliant, some, pedestrian.  Generally, the more mundane hacks were the easiest to exploit -- for example, by intercepting the 'sendMail()' function, we were able to substitute the value of gold we actually sent with an arbitrary one -- as Blizz wasn't checking signed vs unsigned ints on their data types, sending -1 copper to a cohort meant they would receive 65,535 copper on their end.  When the game was new, this was ridiculous, as there probably wasn't 1,000 gold in the entire economy at that point that was legitimately gotten.<p>This was difficult, it was challenging, and yeah, every now and again we'd get a little paranoid at a noise outside, imagining it was a SWAT team ready to breach our house for having violated Blizzard's terms of service.  The highs were high, and the lows weren't that bad, since we were making tons of dough.<p>I cannot imagine the amount of time and energy it takes to farm $2000 worth of gold without these hacks, but I can only guess that it is insane.",1300047700

My file system is totally encrypted and the easiest way to get a copy of it is to not turn the machine off but make a copy of the mounted hard disks first.

When analyzing algorithms, a clear and correct statement of the problem is necessary and the one made here is clearly inadequate.  For example, while the problem calls for an algorithm to ""detect"" overlap, while the algorithms described produce a list the overlapped strings.  Moreover, there is no definition (other than the programs listed) for what is meant by ""overlap"".  Consider ""abc"" and ""abcd"".  The overlapping strings might be ""a"", ""ab"", ""abc"", ""bc"" , and ""c"" under one definition, or simply ""abc"" under another.",1300046421

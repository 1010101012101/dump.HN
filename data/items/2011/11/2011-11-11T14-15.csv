3224744,comment,3224553,3224553,12,0,beloch,,,"That's a completely misleading article.  They haven't ""broken quantum cryptography"", nor have they claimed to.  Yet again, journalists have mislead the public by claiming overly dramatic things that aren't true in order to sell copy.<p>Quantum cryptography is completely and fundamentally secure in theory.  However, real world devices don't behave quite like their theoretical counterparts, and this can create flaws in real world systems.  The idiot journalist did get at least that much right.<p>A big part of research in quantum crypto these days is finding holes in real-world implementations so that we can build future systems without those holes.  Kurtsiefer's group had done just that.  He hasn't broken quantum cryptography, he's helped make the real-world implementations of tomorrow more secure.  This evolutionary improvement of a technology in its infancy has happened again and again, and idiot journalists insist on reporting that ""QUANTUM CRYPTO HAS BEEN BROKEN"" every bloody time.<p>Now, for those of you wondering what good QC is if we can't trust real world implementations, here's the gist of why, even though we'll probably never finish making them better, they're still worth using.<p>If you send a message via conventional factoring based crypto, like RSA, that message must be viewed as being made public with an undefined delay.  Even without quantum computing on the horizon, decryption algorithms are improving at a steady pace and making it possible to crack messages encoded in this way.<p>For example, look at crypto algorithms like DES that, ten years ago, people thought would take thousands of years to crack given Moore's law growing computational resources.  Wide freakin' open now, thanks to improved cracking algorithms.  Any message sent via classical channels can be copied without your knowledge, so any message you sent via DES ten years ago could be decrypted and in anyone's hands without your knowledge.  The same thing is true of anything you send via public key encryption today.  Fortunately for most of us, the information we usually send is only sensitive for a limited period of time.  Who cares if your credit card number is decoded in ten years?   You'll have a new one.<p>Anyone with long-term sensitive transmissions to make has to look at other methods of encryption.  That's why quantum crypto has early adopters.  Now, say a hole is found in one of these early adopters systems.  Are they screwed?  Is the cat out of the bag?  <i>No</i>.  Thanks to how quantum cryptography works, there is no possible copy of the transmission that could be cracked with technology developed later in time, as is the case with public key encryption.  Attacks on quantum systems have to work at the time the message is sent.  If a flaw in the system was not known and an eavesdropper not present and taking advantage of it at the time a message was sent, it will be secure for all time.  That's the difference.  Public key encryption is secure for a while.  Quantum encryption is secure for all time.",1321023267

Training is a pain and 15k is not that much for having to deal with 3 months of lost productivity while a new employe comes up to speed and that's if you don't have to replace the role several times to find a good candidate. You now know that you are worth 45k so don't let your current employer short change you, tell them you really like it and do not want to leave but that they will have to match. I look at work a little differently than many. I love my job and I love to develop but I work for money, if I did not have to I would be certainly working on my own ideas exclusively so if I have to work and the jobs are fairly similar I go to the highest bidder. Like it or not employment is a business transaction where each party is trying to get the better end of the deal based on the information they have. You just gained information that you are more valuable than you are being compensated for, don't let them convince you of reasons that you are not. With that said, if you have any agreements with your current employer that you will stay with them for any amount of time even if it was just verbal, you need to honor that agreement.

The problem is that they didn't try harder and instead preferred explicit code too much in my opinion. I still like Go, but its main selling point in my opinion is that programs written in it start fast enough. Maybe a second important feature is that deployment is helped by statically linked programs, where one .exe is all you need.<p>That sends me back to the Delphi days and I'm not too happy either. Because Delphi provided those kinds of features and we ended up losing it in favor of Java and .NET craziness.<p>The thing is, Go web apps start faster in the App Engine than web apps made with some of the other languages and also may take up fewer resources. That means that App Engine applications can be scaled up and down because spinning up new processes (with Go apps) is instant.<p>Here's an example:<p><pre><code>    $ cat hn.go && 8g hn.go && 8l -o hn hn.8 && time ./hn

They also don't care to purchase anything that can be purchased from India for a tenth of the cost.<p>Big pharma does not care about their scientists.

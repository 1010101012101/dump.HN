638624,comment,637575,637973,0,0,timdorr,,,"Awesome job, PJ and team. I first heard about this at Startup Riot 2009 when Chris came to speak.<p>Although, my initial concern is how this is being spun to customers in terms of customization. One of my design clients is a SaaS vendor that had a large potential customer request an on-site deployment of their big product. Along with packaging up their software for a remote deployment, the customer was asking for all kinds of modifications to match up with their very particular needs. This was sort of spreading them thin on what they could work on for the customer and for the core product. So, my question is are you going to provide customization options for purchasers, or is the product just a rebuilt copy of whatever state the GitHub code is at? I'm a fan of what you guys have built, so I'd hate to see it suffer.",1243976322

638561,comment,636494,638250,0,0,vaksel,,,"I'm pretty sure that there is almost 0 aftermarket support for the X6/335d, at least at this point. But thats not the point, the point is that BMW Aftermarket parts cost an arm and a leg. Take the BMW 335i for example...you can spend close to $2,000 for a Dinan exhaust, only to get a 6hp gain. Thats just not something thats viable for most people, especially offroaders who'd end up denting the thing after a few outings. And chances are the cost will be even higher, since the run would be much smaller.<p>Building a vehicle alongside an expert, for most people would mean standing behind the expert's back and looking. The whole idea that someone will pick up how to work on the car is luducrous. For one, the expert will be working on the car using a lift, and all the necessary tools, while the customer would be working on the floor of their garage with half the tools missing. Adding a complicated engine to the mix, that few people are experts on, outside of the dealership, just seems unnecessary. I mean lets face it, the engine choice is just a gimmick.<p>You are forgetting the 3rd part, price. Yes, people would pick the green engine if it produced the same performance as a regular engine.(Although I'm not that sure about the offroader crowd), but not when they need to pay 4-5K more for the car because of it.<p>The usual enthusiast equation is: ""Performance, Reliability, Price, choose 2"". Gas mileage isn't really part of the equation. Yes the need to replace parts, may be decreased due to reliability, but when you do need to replace parts, you'll be paying an arm and a leg, because its a BMW.<p>Jumping may be a part of the fun, but I just don't see people jumping in a 50K car. A dedicated off roader, you built in your garage for 10K...sure, a 50K car? No way.<p>Yes lowering the point of gravity will help with stability, but I wouldn't count on this thing to be highway safe. Which kinda makes me doubt that this thing will end up being road legal.<p>The stance and size are aggressive, but the concept itself, makes it look like one of those lifted compact car pics you see floating around on the net. + the front end kinda says that someone spent all their effort developing the side profile, and then threw together a quick front end. The lights for example, look like fog lights, and not standalone headlamps.<p>50K is cheap depending on what segment you attack. The problem is that the segment you are attacking is focused mainly on the 20 year old Broncos and Wranglers. 50K for a sporty looking car is no problem, and will make it much easier to sell the cars. For every offroader guy who wants a 50K offroader, you'll have a thousand sports car guys who want a 50K sports car.<p>The thing is, that with sports cars, you can pretty much getaway with simply building a beautiful car. Its pretty easy to make a car perform, since the formula has been known for a while. And its much easier to make it be reliable, compared to an offroader that gets taken for jumps. Getting a bunch of people bitching that your car blew the shocks after 3 months is not good for business. Doesn't matter if you don't have warranty, and that everyone knows that if you take the car offroad, it won't last as long.<p>The thing is that the Nemesis has pedigree, the Bowler team has won numerous races. The guys at top gear have creamed their pants about the Bowler. The Rally Fighter is pretty much an unknown, with no pedigree, and questionable looks. When you buy a Bowler, the person knows, I can now win this thing. Unless you can arrange the Rally Fighter to enter into a rally, and win, it'll be a problem. And even then, how many people compete in Rallies? You can't base your business on a few hundred people.<p>Yes building other cars down the road is a good idea, my point is that for a first car, you need something that'll bring attention to your brand. And the offroader segment is just too small and too outside the mainstream to do it. If your first car is a 50K sports car, you'll pretty much expose your brand to the entire country. You'll be covered by all publications. If your first car is a 50K Offroader, you'll just be covered in the 4-5 offroader mags. The whole offroader concept may have some legs later on, when you have a line up of other cars. But building it as a first car, is equivalent to corporate suicide. Take the Bowler for example, great offroader, but its pretty much unknown outside of the offroader community, and even there, most people have no idea what it is.<p>The whole idea of having people work on the car is not cost efficient. You need to do the same thing as the Catarham guys, give the option to just ship the parts, and give the option to buy a pre-assembled car from a dealer. Thats the only way to go mainstream.<p>As far as location, I'm in NJ.<p>As far as a sports car I desire that's not out there. Well lets see: the car would need to be a 3 door coupe(Like the Integra/RSX/Supra/300ZX). Powertrain would include a twin turbo engine, AWD and a 6 speed manual. All the important settings should be adjustable from the cockpit.<p>Power selector: 3 stages - Daily Driver - 200hp(optimized for max mpg), Sport - 350hp, Race - 500hp. Do this by modifying the boost controller and fuel maps.<p>Drivetrain selector: Auto - Acts as RWD until it starts slipping, at which point starts shifting power to the front wheels. Manual - give the user a way to manually choose the setup. If I want to have 100% RWD, it should let me do that.<p>Suspension selector: 3 Settings: Daily Driver, Sport, Race, that adjusts the shock stiffness/ride height based on driver preference.<p>Extra features: HIDs, LSD, Traction Control(that can be 100% turned off), Digital Gauge Cluster(fully modifiable/wi-fi capable)<p>Something like that would fly of the shelves at 50K. Probably at 100K even. Just as long as the car looks good. As long as you have the looks, people will be willing to give the car a chance.",1243974263

If you find yourself in such business you have to be very good at controlling costs, but you can still be very profitable.<p>In the case of Apple I perhaps should be more accurate - their business has parts that do not scale well and parts that do scale well. The stores and the app review parts do not scale, therefore Apple must be super-diligent in controlling costs there. Result of cost-control is of course less trained and less well paid personnel. Hence the gaffes with review process are to be expected. Apple's fault is in not designing a proper escalation process (other than the ""Techcrunch PR egg-on-face channel"") .<p>By the way, the jury is still out on how much the app sales are bringing to Apple and what are the costs of the review process.

Rolling keycode generators are also nice (and not terrible to implement).<p>* Double-check your security at the data center. I was working on secure data storage, not email, so the problem set was slightly different. However, there was some technology we were looking at licensing that used a physical air-gap on a router to remove data from the network when it wasn't authorized to be online. Probably not economical for individual email accounts; but possibly useful for bigger clients. As an example, years ago I was talking to someone at a Proctor & Gamble research facility. All of their computers used detachable hard drives (well, Iomega Jaz drives, but still) and at the end of the day, every drive got removed from the computer and locked into a safe. That way if there was an intrusion, the data was totally inaccessible.<p>* Add an sms interface that would just text someone a keycode (similar to a rolling code generator, but would just require a cell phone).",1243973038

Also, exactly how many pixels do you expect to ship? Deployed robots in Iraq send a highly compressed 320x240 color stream -- maybe two. <p>There is an awesome system by Chatten Associates that might be relevant to Anybots. They have a fast pan-tilt camera with analog broadcast to minimize latency to a tele-operator. The operator has a head mounted display with gyros, and here is the kicker: the gyros control the pan-tilt. This means that the camera looks where the human is looking. It's amazingly immersive. Even a small field of view camera works well.

The problem is historical, and the only way to over come it is by brute force or by some random fluke like some new super-popular app is only scriptable with Lisp.<p><i>Complexity of implementation? Slowness? Lack of marketing? Unfamiliar syntax?</i><p>The answer is more like 'all of the above,' as well as not anticipating the rise of Windows and Unix (which is not necessarily a bad thing).",1193418637

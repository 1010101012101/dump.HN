3414227,comment,3414012,3414200,0,0,BrianHV,,,"I haven't tried Prezi in public. But to me, the big opportunity in this for a well-organized presenter is the ability to spatially orient your audience.<p>I can imagine a history lecturer creating a timeline spanning the entire length of the course, marking major events on it. When he wants to discuss a topic, he zooms in on the timeline so that the students get both context and specificity.<p>I can imagine an elementary music teacher designing a presentation with instruments grouped by family, zooming in first on the woodwinds, then on the single reeds, then on the saxophones. When moving to a new family, it would zoom out first to remind the students of how the instruments relate to each other.<p>I can even imagine any routine three-point presentation could benefit from the added context that spatial reference can provide.<p>Animation for animation's sake would almost certainly be detrimental to a presentation. But I'm excited about tools like this because they give good presenters the opportunity to present information in a way that wasn't previously possible.",1325462214

If we are talking about articles that are colored with commercial self-interest or bias, that is the very definition.  I would posit that there is a silent majority who are relatively satisfied with their current employment, who read a few comments to see if anyone is hiring to do orthographic drawing theory or NLP in Erlang or topology or [obscure area of research interest] and failing that alt-tab back to Vim to work on arbitrarily less exciting yet still interesting projects.<p>I don't necessarily disagree with you that it wasn't a particularly high-quality article, that we can do better.

A ""Comparison of 6 USB Stick Micro Dev Boards"" --- <i>unquestionably</i> more germane to the site than this --- is welcome by everyone, but passionately supported by few. Occupy (or Tea Party) advocacy is largely unwelcome on the site <i>by charter</i>, but passionately supported by enough people to peg stories to the top of the front page.<p>The result is a site that looks more like 2008 Reddit than 2008 HN. In fact, because HN is doing such a good job attracting the Slashdot ""Your Rights Online"" crowd, we're seeing more and more stories for which Reddit threads are <i>better</i> than HN's.<p>I used to think the big problem with 'pg's guidelines were that it was squishy about politics; it should, I thought, be rewritten to say ""No politics, no religion, no cute pictures, ever."" I still think that. But the better thing for the guidelines to say is even simpler:<p><i>No advocacy stories.</i>",1325460772

3414152,comment,3413740,3414053,0,0,gruseom,,,"I was puzzling over the same question. Some of these words are semantically overloaded, and as far as I can tell there's no single interpretation that makes it all ""work out"" the way you would require if this were math. There are two meanings to ""adding 7"":<p>1. adding 7 arithmetically to obtain the same note an octave higher;<p>2. adding in a 7th note to whatever chord you are playing.<p>But the way the chords are named isn't what you'd guess from those two meanings. If it were, you'd add a 6th to C major to get C6 (that part is true) and then a 7th to C6 to get C13 (that part is not true). Instead, there's yet a third way the notes are ""added"", namely cumulatively in the following sequence (I've cribbed most of this from the OP):<p><pre><code>  C      C+E+G
  C7     C+E+G+B♭ 
  C9     C+E+G+B♭+D 
  C11    C+E+G+B♭+D+F 
  C13    C+E+G+B♭+D+F+A
</code></pre>
(The author's argument is that while the chords are theoretically defined to include all these notes equally, some notes - especially B♭ - are more important than others. So even if you drop E,G,D,F and only play C+B♭+A, that's still arguably C13. He's saying that's the essence of the chord.)<p>I suppose some arbitrariness is inevitable, because there are only so many letters and numbers to go around, and more chords with a plausible claim to the ""best"" names -- which, if you know regular expressions, would be something like [A-G][1-9]+ -- than there are names available. One beautiful thing about music is that it isn't math (we have math for that). It seems to overlap with math and then mixes everything up in mind-blowing ways, at which point all you can do is feel. Well, memorize and feel.<p>Does anyone know historically how C13 got to mean ""C+E+G+B♭+D+F+A"" rather than ""C+E+G+B♭+A"", which if you consider things only symbolically, seems more likely? Obviously, it must be because that's what people were playing - but who? Presumably jazz musicians? When was this name settled upon?",1325460354

When times are good they will bleed you dry, but when times are bad they will show no loyalty.</i><p>I don't agree with this, contractors make up a large spectrum of individuals, all are not the same, just as some employees may not be loyal, so too are some contractors. I personally contract until I find something worthwhile to get involved in, but I do expect to be compensated for what I am doing, we can call it bleeding dry or we can call it fair market value, but the reality is whether contractor or employee, developers are high value assets. It just so happens that a lot of them that freelance know what their value is and charge accordingly. But to malign them as mercenaries and uninterested in the success of their clients I think is a little unfair. There are sociopaths in contracting just like there are sociopaths employees.",1325459321

Because there is a giant overlap between hackers and musicians.<p>For those of you interested, but confused, go to a music store and ask for a ""fake book,"" a big collection of tunes in ""head chart"" format (just melody and the kind of chord symbols being discussed here.

3414098,comment,3402359,3406972,0,0,lambda,,,"I read the article. Most of the arguments seemed to be pretty dubious, like the ""cost of printing the calendars"" argument. I addressed the one that seemed most relevant, the one about financial calculations, by pointing out that it would be possible to set a different standardized calendar for just financial instruments without changing the calendar for everything else.<p>The rest of the arguments are really just throwaways. Not waste time devising new academic calendars? You're going to be devising new schedules each year anyhow, as the courses offered change, professors change, new students change and enroll in different classes, sports league pairings change, and so on. And the existing system doesn't require re-doing the basic calendar every year; you can devise 14 calendars up front (one for each day of the week, times two to account for leap years), and then do the scheduling within one of those 14 basic calendars. The cost of that is going to be pretty minimal, going from 14 calendars to 2 calendars isn't that big of a win.<p>Drug prescriptions? People are imperfect; they don't necessarily take drugs precisely and regularly, such that you can avoid all variance in the rate of drugs being prescribed. With many drugs, if you miss one dose, you just take your regular dose the next day, and are now off by a day from the prescription cycle. Or sometimes, people might take a little more of a drug than prescribed, or lose it and need a refill sooner. And drug prescriptions should be reviewed by doctors on a yearly basis anyhow. If prescription systems have to deal with that, there is basically no benefit to be gained from having months and days line up precisely year after year.",1325459016

To give an example, Uber would normally be ~$35 from the party I was at last night in SF's Mission to my home.<p>With a 6.25x multiplier in place it would have been just under $220.  There is just NO WAY I'd spend that to go 2 miles to get home.  But obviously some people were prepared to, and that must be <i>golden</i> information for Uber in terms of future pricing planning.<p>I also wonder whether that could be used in other pricing scenarios, such as SaaS, where if some level of (artificial/real) scarcity could be put in place you could see how much people are really prepared to pay for your service.",1325458950

The next chord is then a 9th chord, so you add a 9th interval, but it wraps around modulo 8, so it's really a 2nd interval (since intervals are 1-indexed).  Next it's an 11th chord, but the interval is really a 4th, and so on.  The idea is to think of them spread out though, as successive thirds.",1325458940

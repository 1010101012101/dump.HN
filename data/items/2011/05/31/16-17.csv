As long as people know the operation doesn't protect you from contracting STD's, that's good enough for me. It's their choice whether to still use a condom or not.

You have to make up for your lack of industry experience with your own personal projects and show that you have  the skills or the initiative to pick up new things quickly.<p>My short story:<p>I graduated college w/ a degree in EE and after working for a defense company for about a year, realized I hated it.  Web dev/design was my hobby and I had hacked together a lot of random projects, but never had any ""official industry experience"".  On my resume I had listed a lot of side projects I had.  I applied to a few places and a few called me in for an interview and also a short test of what I knew.  This is where you will get a chance to try and prove yourself.  I was nervous as heck, but thankfully, they gave me a chance and the rest was history.<p>I don't think I would have been given the chance had I not been doing those things on the side.  The other nice side effect was that because I actively worked on projects, I actually knew what I was doing and for some reason that surprised a lot of employers(?).<p>I think the one thing I took away from that was that if you're passionate about learning and improving, you'll be better off than the majority of people just there looking for a job.  ""3+ years"" exp. or whatever had a different meaning for me after that.",1306860995

2603345,comment,2602308,2603103,2,0,kmfrk,,,"Cloud-synced bookmarks and notes - preferably with a social profile like that of Kindle[1][2]. The way I read books is to make a lot of notes and highlights; I know some people don't do this, but this helps me summarize books more easily and ""reread"" them, if I need to. Picking out your favourite passages of <i>Aesop</i>, <i>The Art of War</i> and <i>The Prince</i> is extremely convenient. That not how everyone reads and digests books, but it's definitely how I do - and I assume that many students will want to do the same with their textbooks.<p>The book selection is also very meagre[3] (at least in this country), but more important, some of the available free books are typeset from hell. It's just a copy-paste of Project Gutenberg and similar endeavours, which are not formatted for iBooks at all. This does not inspire me to buy any iBooks, and it leaves me to wonder how the (free) book user experience can be so bad, when Apple make such an effort of vetting apps from trivial ailments.<p>Another, perhaps minor, thing is that I can't highlight across pages, which drives me absolutely bonkers.<p>If I were an author (or worked for one) and wanted to release a book on iOS, would I distribute it via iBooks or create a native app for it like Al Gore did? I honestly don't know, and I have a feeling that my hesitation has more to do with the shortcomings of iBooks than the allure of making a standalone app.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Craig-Mod/52461"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kindle.amazon.com/profile/Craig-Mod/52461</a><p>[2]: I'm sure it would be in Steve Jobs's best interest to make us forget Ping as soon as possible.

2603342,comment,2602911,2603224,1,0,jdavid,,,"Actually the largest price driver of gold now is 'fear'.<p>Since many countries price their currencies to the USD, the USD has become a defacto currency.  This means that inflationary pressure on the USD affects the whole world.<p>Gold prices are up as people are speculating that some countries will price their currency against gold.  If countries don't do this, or if people stop believing that countries will do this, gold will go down in value.<p>Ironically large company stocks are probably the largest most stable and fluid currencies left.  I think the term is fungible.<p>So if you buy stock in say a microsoft or a google, the changes are that those large company stocks will trade well if your home country's currency is inflating.  The reason is that large companies diversify their holdings and optimize those holdings for profit.  This is something that governments rarely do well.<p>I have started to wonder if investing in a sort of International Dow Jones as a currency base makes sense.  I don't know how it would work, but it would be better than using gift cards as part of a currency as suggested by a few.<p>As for bitcoin as a currency, it seems to be based off of the cost of energy/ computing efficiency, however the currency does not seem to have been designed to match the USD, but rather make use of a set of tech features that were convenient to demonstrate it's proof.<p>It seems clear to me that Bit Coin Miner's will find the largest profits in using FPGA's, and that is unlikely to create a cloud structure that is useful for other things.

If you already have the program written, it is natural to want to take the easy way out and just slap up a form that matches the code.<p>An aside, being someone who enjoys playing both roles, I find the design phase goes a long way to improving the structure of my application because I have time to get a better understanding of the requirements, program flow, etc. Every element I draw automatically turns into code in my head, thinking about how it is going to be implemented as best as possible. The program is already written long before I ever touch a text editor.<p>Furthermore, programming is design. A programmer's job is to write code that is not only functional, but code that is visually appealing. Visual appeal is the factor that makes code maintainable or not. It is basic human nature to want to work on pretty code and reject ugly code. As such, it is wrong to say programmers do not have artistic talent. They exercise it each and every day. The only thing many programmers lack is practise in designing visual interfaces.<p>Given all of that, I find it very unfortunate that we try to separate the design and development jobs.

Programming is taught more effectively than math and its because you don't spend a lot of time mind-numbingly repeating the basics.<p>Half the people on HN recommend teaching with Python for just this reason.<p>And think about it, when you teach programming do you make your student walk through what every instruction does?  When I learned recursion, I walked through fib(n) by hand -- once.  That's the sum total of how many times I've done a full hand expansion of a recursion in my life.   How many times have I run a full program on paper with the substitution model?  Never.  How many times have I iterated even a small loop by hand?  Never.  These are concepts that I understand as well as anything that I know, yet I've never ""mind-numingly"" worked through them by hand.<p>A lot of traditional math teachers want us to sit down with an instruction pointer, stacks, heaps, physical/virtual pages, laid out and have us repeatedly simulate program.  That's really the mathematical equivalent of doing this rote computation.  I say teach them the concepts and give them interesting and challenging problems that make use of the concepts.

That would be a giant leap in mining capability, but perhaps not so much as to cause collapse. Switching to 512-bit hashes would bring us back to where we are now.",1306857827

However, it's the inherent long-term lack of liquidity that dooms this usage. To be viable in scale, a cash-replacement like bitcoins needs to be highly liquid, but there are two effective choke points to this specific hidden economy. The first is that conventional retail businesses (as opposed to individuals) must accept the currency _in_scale_, and there are a number of reasons this won't happen, including the trackablity of bitcoin usage over the network (and inevitable IRS issues). The second is that paypal, banks, etc, will shut down conversion sites, as paypal is already beginning to do, and that will severely diminish the usefulness of the system.",1306857770

Computation simply is a lot less important now as we have tools that do them with far greater speed and accuracy.  And I'm from the generation that did tons of computation, but I honestly never had a great grasp of it.  I just knew there were steps to be taken (leave an extra space to right as you do long multiplication)  -- and I was one of the top math students in the district.<p>In fact I'd argue that I never really understood much of any math until grad school.  I was computational sophisticated, but lacked understanding.<p>And oddly, I seem to find quite the opposite problem from what the blog author describes.  I find students who know 3x5.  But struggle to understand when the Fourier Transform is appropriate.  Sure, if they're looking at problem sets at the back of the chapter about Fourier Transforms then they'll start with it, but in the real world they lack the conceptual understanding of it.  I've met students who can compute the SVD, they can tell you the text book definition, but don't actually intuitively know what it means.  They don't know when it should be applied, or when it is applied, what it means.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/11/23/conrad-wolframs-ted-talk-stop-teaching-calculating-start-teaching-math/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wolfram.com/2010/11/23/conrad-wolframs-ted-talk-...</a>",1306857717

Are you limited to Excel types or could you extend it arbitrarily?<p>VBA is a kludge, but I&#x27;ve always thought that spreadsheets might be an interesting programming environment if you were restricted to the native functionality with a small addition. Namely, add a new value type: &quot;anonymous function,&quot; which consists of parameters with an excel-native body, which can be assigned to a cell. You could then call the function by referring to the cell it&#x27;s stored in (or any other way you can get a reference to it) and passing parameters. Function naming would work by using named ranges.",1406833177

However, I think it may go even deeper.<p>From what I understand, Japan has never been a fully self-sufficient economy.

Instead playing with my own websites, I thought it would be more fun to find the same vulnerabilities in other sites.<p>You can imagine my excitement and disbelief when one of the largest online DVD retailers in the world ended up spitting out over 600,000  records complete with SSN, full name, address, credit card number/expiry/CVV, email. Among these records I found the information of a certain female CEO of the world&#x27;s 2nd largest food and beverage company (or someone pretending to be her). Of course, about 70% of these were expired, but I was just curious. I had no intent to use them (okay maybe a little itch).<p>My excitement quickly turned into fear as I realized the legal implications of such a feat. And against my better judgement, I contacted the company and let them know about the vulnerability.<p>Fortunately, after warning me that they would use the law to its full extent in punishing me if they ever found those records leaked/used, they left me alone.<p>Around that same time I also compromised various government departments of South Asian countries (think Indonesia, Malaysia, etc). But they never replied when I notified them.<p>Still scares me to this day.",1406833007

Perhaps I&#x27;m overestimating their importance, and these are definitely just anecdotes and not data, but these might be worth considering:<p>- Relationships. Almost everyone I know who has stayed in one city/area for more than 4-5 years has the phone numbers of a few auto drivers they trust. These are the first who are likely to get a call when they have time and need to make a quick trip to a friends house or the grocery store.  OTOH, while The same goes for cabs, they tend to have the numbers of a local cab company, not the driver. The cab company gets a call only for longer trips; typically the ones that lead out of town.<p>- Trust. Ties in with above, people are wary of unknown auto/cab drivers. I know a lot of people >40 tend to prefer calling someone they know rather than flagging down an unknown auto/cab, more so late at night.<p>- Roads and weather. I know a few places where driving in a car is almost impossible. The roads are just too narrow to allow it. Perhaps not a large market for cabs but one heavily trafficked by autos.<p>- Regional culture variations. Bangaloreans in my circles tend to prefer autos, while Mumbaikars prefer cabs.

Google was not checking the referrer of the sign up form, nor was it comparing the IP address that received the CAPTCHA to the one that submitted it.<p>I had a friend load that script into thousands of generated blogspot blogs, which got long tail google traffic and asked the user to &quot;fill the CAPTCHA to continue.&quot; The script ran for ~2 weeks and generated ~60000 Google accounts all from unique IP addresses.<p>That was around 2007, so obviously it&#x27;s all patched up by now. I was 15 years old and never did anything with the accounts, so if anyone from google is reading this, keep the lawyers away from me please.<p>Blackhat SEO actually has a lot of clever tricks. I haven&#x27;t been part of that space in a while, for a lot of reasons, but I can attribute 99% of my knowledge of marketing to time spent trawling through blackhat SEO forums reading not only about that, but also landing page optimization, conversion tracking, copywriting, etc. It was definitely a worthwhile learning experience for me.",1406831965

8116089,comment,8114916,8116031,4,0,visarga,,,"> MOOC movement (or at least where it has seen success), tends to focus on self-motivated, usually high-aptitude students. But, almost by definition, those attributes do not describe most students<p>I think MOOC&#x27;s could benefit from face-to-face coaching. Students need someone to see them, to acknowledge their efforts, to monitor their progress and give them encouragement or advice when needed. This is the job of a coach, or educational counselor, not a teacher.<p>The teacher can very well be teaching the course on video, but the student needs to be observed by a real person in order to get that special feeling that motivates and makes the whole process efficient. A bunch of counselors distributed to major cities could serve a lot of students taking online courses, but they need to feel accountable to a person, not just a website. It&#x27;s easy to do that and fits well with the online delivery model.<p>MOOC&#x27;s could be a great solution to life-long learning and keeping up to date with relevant skills. Especially in computer science, a 4 or 5 year college program is too long - by the time the students finish, many specific technologies they learned might be already obsolete. Instead, coming back for a course or two every year might work much better in the long run.<p>MOOC&#x27;s might still work out if they could be coupled with employment from the start - let Coursera or Udacity partner up with various companies and create relevant courses, and use this opportunity to teach and rank the participants and in the end, offer jobs to the ones that are up to par with their skills. This would make MOOC&#x27;s much more valuable than what they are now.",1406831945

In the end, MOOCs end up being a smokescreen that helps universities and governments avoid making substantive changes to address the affordability of education.  The fact that it also helps them collect tuition from more students without spending any money on infrastructure or professor salaries on top of that is why so many University administrators become visibly aroused at the mention of MOOCs.",1406831807

Like Ripple, Stellar requires special (and dangerous) trust in certain nodes. For example, gateways (<a href=""https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/#gateways"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stellar.org/blog/introducing-stellar/#gateways</a>) have to be trusted by the Stellar network as they send messages like &quot;a user deposited 100 USD via a bank wire transfer, so please accept this digital representation of 100 USD, trust me&quot;. This trust is dangerous as people running an (initially) honest gateway may start acting maliciously and lie about how much USD or EUR or other currency exist on the network. By the time the malice is detected, maybe the network could trace all USD or EUR that was issued by the gateway, and revoke it, suddenly pissing off a lot of users who owns this currency as it would disappear from their wallet. Users would then loose trust in Stellar, and the network would collapse...<p>Stripe would presumably be the first gateway trusted by the Stellar network. Okay, so what if Stripe decided they could not trust other gateways and wanted to remain the only gateway? Well Stripe would be the <i>only</i> way to inject USD or EUR or other currencies in the network, effectively making Stellar a fully centralized digital currency, with the entire Stellar network being dependent on Stripe not being hacked, not being abused by a malicious employee, not shutting down, etc.<p>This is the complete opposite design principle of Bitcoin which requires absolutely no trust in any specific authority.",1406830736

The &quot;then&quot; clause is a symbol, while the &quot;else&quot; clause is a boolean.  Furthermore, if the &quot;then&quot; clause is taken, the resulting symbol is considered truthy by the if operator.  So, the innermost if expression evaluates to true, then, moving outward, we get &#x27;John (which is truthy), then we get &#x27;Catherine (which is also truthy), then finally we get &#x27;Thomas, which is bound to name.<p>PHP&#x27;s truthiness rules are different from Scheme&#x27;s (and are far more complicated), but for this particular expression, the net result is the same.<p>For comparison, every other language with a ?: operator behaves like this:<p><pre><code>  > (define nom (if (eq? initial &#x27;M)\n                  &#x27;Mike\n                  (if (eq? initial &#x27;J)\n                    &#x27;John\n                    (if (eq? initial &#x27;C)\n                      &#x27;Catherine\n                        (if (eq? initial &#x27;T)\n                          &#x27;Thomas\n                          &#x27;unknown)))))\n  > nom\n  John\n</code></pre>\nWhich is far more useful.",1406830711

If they win that bid, prepare for some shake up down the line.<p>Their strategy is to provide service at a <i>fixed</i>, fair price: No options, all included. Although they provide additional services, it&#x27;s an ISP that actually knows it&#x27;s a dumb data pipe: on broadband, you get the maximum bandwidth you can have; on mobile, data is data, so tethering is bundled. They were the first to provide native IPv6, FTTH, Gbps ports, etc... to end users. They definitely like to try out new tech (e.g they have additional compression and error correction on their ADSL2+ system, that provides a boost to throughput and stability).<p>They leverage FOSS products to integrate them into their architecture. For example, their set-top box is an AirPlay audio and video receiver. Back in the day they provided free FTP and web hosting (basically Apache and vsftpd) to their users, along with 1GB of IMAP mail storage when everyone was stuck with a dozen megabytes and POP. On the whole, they have a tendency to please the tech tinkering crowd, the router having features often found on homemade Linux NAS or Sinology systems†.<p>They regularly stand up for their users. When they were legally required to provide personal data from IP adresses, they did so in the most unpractical way possible (IIRC printed out via fax or snail mail). Recently they refused to pay for unbalanced peering, resulting in slow Youtube performance.<p>On the bad side, they&#x27;re known to sacrifice stability to reach the price target, knowing that things will improve later as the system stabilises. Their service usually works well but they often have trouble scaling up to match demand, up to when the demand stabilises and they&#x27;re finally able to catch up. Customer support used to be weak but has greatly improved. On mobile, SMS suffered delays and delivery issues††, calls failed to connect, power consumption was higher (I bet a failure to negotiate proper power profiles with baseband), but things have largely stabilised.

She was in the crosswalk, clearly marked.  There was no light or stop sign, but she was in the middle of the 4 lanes when the cop drove past her in the closest lane.  I really couldn&#x27;t believe what I was seeing.<p>When the cops don&#x27;t even respect the laws, the laws are meaningless.",1406829707

Rather than accept the result, it&#x27;s likely that before it&#x27;s declared &quot;SCIENCE!&quot; a NASA or MIT or whoever is going to want to have verification from someplace that doesn&#x27;t have a long history of misrepresenting scientific claims.<p>This is going to be treated differently than if the original work was done at say...CERN and the confirmation was done by CalTech.",1406829686

Of course, Tesla could also use vertical windmills [1], geothermal, etc at its stations.

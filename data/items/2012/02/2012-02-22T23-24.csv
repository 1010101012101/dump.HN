By the way I do work at StackMob, so in the interest of full disclosure I ought to mention that!  But I'm here as a fellow frontend developer.<p>I had to make a site for my fiancee and I's wedding, and I realized I could whip one up really quick and just stick it on StackMob - backend, hosting, everything.<p>An example saving/fetching data to/from StackMob via the StackMob JS SDK (built on Backbone.js):<p>var user = new StackMob.User({ username: 'ericktai', password: 'opensesame', ..});
user.create(); //this saves your user to the datastore on StackMob's servers in the background via AJAX<p>var users = new StackMob.Users(); //notice plural
users.fetch(); //this fetches all users<p>var user = new StackMob.User({ username: 'ericktai'});  //notice singular
user.fetch(); //this fetches my user from StackMob<p>Sounds like you're writing a JS web app, so you can also try our JS SDK that lets you connect to StackMob's backend - it's your datastore already built on servers.  Here's a tutorial I wrote up to give you an idea of what that actually means programatically.<p><a href=""http://www.stackmob.com/devcenter/docs/JS-SDK-Tutorial"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stackmob.com/devcenter/docs/JS-SDK-Tutorial</a><p>To make sure you don't run into any cross domain AJAX call issues, we host your html app also.  This relieves you of having to worry about whether browsers support cross-origin headers or not.<p>Good luck to you developing!  It's great that there are so many tools out there nowadays like aespinoza mentioned!  Find the tool that works best for you :)",1329951859

OK, there goes all my interest.<p>It's odd how you just expect certain kinds of software to be open source today.<p>Edit: Since I'm getting downvoted as-is, let me flesh out this posting with some more explanation for my stance: My text editor is an application I will invest a lot of time in learning and customizing, and it's important to me that this investment will end up being worth the effort long into the future. With a closed source text editor, I don't have the same level of confidence that the product will continue to exist and be maintained. Closed source also means that parts of the application are off-limits to customization, and I don't want to be beholden to another's determination of what part of the app is on that side of the fence.",1329951684

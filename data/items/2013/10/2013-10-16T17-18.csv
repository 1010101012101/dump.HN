To put it another way, I would call any cryptosystem that can be attacked in polynomial time &quot;broken,&quot; yet in the case of Bitcoin there is the 51% attack which apparently does not bother you -- and like I said, despite the fact that I call it broken, I cannot actually point to anything that would have required Bitcoin to be secure against such an attack.<p>To put things in scientific terms, we are talking about falsifiable hypotheses.  As an example, here is a commonly assumed hypothesis:  the block cipher AES is a pseudorandom permutation.  This is a claim that could be disproved i.e. we can falsify the claim by presenting an algorithm that efficiently distinguishes AES input/output pairs (with a secret key that the algorithm does not receive as input) from the input/output pairs of a random permutation.  Consequently we can speak about the security of AES in a meaningful way, even though have no theoretical proof that it meets its security definition (only heuristic evidence and a lack of known attacks).<p>My point about Bitcoin is that we do not have such a hypothesis, so we cannot even be sure that we mean the same thing when we say, &quot;Bitcoin is secure&quot; or &quot;Bitcoin is broken.&quot;  That is the point of having a security definition.  Without such definitions, you can <i>always</i> make the claim that Bitcoin is secure, not matter what sort of attacks are carried out, because you can always just say that Bitcoin is not supposed to defend against those attacks.",1381945912

Design your threaded code around a simple principle: one thread&#x27;s code must never touch another thread&#x27;s data. Now you have safe threaded code. If you want to add some limited well-documented cases where you break that golden rule, go for it and reap the performance benefits.<p>There are some things that some threading models can be criticized for. For example, POSIX threads cannot be killed if they get stuck. However, threads are a powerful tool. The idea that you can share the in-memory code between all your threads is great. Additionally, you can share state and <i>you</i> control how and when it is shared. Want complete isolation? Communicate via queues! Want some shared state for performance reasons? Go for it! Want complete and utter chaos that will blow up as soon as you look at it funny? Let threads access other thread&#x27;s data at will.<p>Your argument is similar to one that table saws are terrible because one cannot guarantee that they will never cut off your fingers.<p>Edit: one other problem with callbacks. AFAIK, no implementation of callback-based concurrency is able to take advantage of multiple hardware cores for true parallelism. In the meantime OS schedulers already take care of distributing OS threads between CPU cores, and some green thread implementations do this as well.",1381945843

It&#x27;s also possible that this person came out as a GS-14 rather than a lower GS-12 or GS-13 due to the attempt at merit based pay (NSPS) that was canceled 3 (4?) years back. Their pay may have been improved via merit increases under NSPS and GS-14 might have been the closest equivalent to their pay or they could have been miscoded as a GS-14 equivalent and it wasn&#x27;t corrected. Most of these were left as-is rather than fighting to &quot;demote&quot; them to avoid the hassle. Especially since most of them would be retiring within 5 years or so, or would have been promoted to that same level in the near future. Rather than demote them they just won&#x27;t get the promotion just a lateral move.<p>GS grades tend to correspond to scope of work, degree of education required and scope of responsibilities. If the work doesn&#x27;t require a college degree, don&#x27;t expect anything above GS-9, and probably no better than GS-7. If it&#x27;s &quot;business ops&quot; that requires a degree but has limited responsibilities you might be a GS-11, engineers are (after their &quot;apprenticeship&quot; period) between GS-11 and GS-13 (essentially, education + depth of knowledge, most GS-13 engineers will be SMEs, subject matter experts). Supervisors will typically be one grade above those they supervise, maybe on par with SMEs, with a typical minimum grade of GS-11. So a supervisor in charge of 40 engineers might be a GS-13, their boss would be a GS-14 and that persons boss a GS-15.",1381945776

6561027,comment,6560214,6560813,3,0,rdtsc,,,"> Threads are the WorseIsBetter approach to concurrency;<p>Threads/Actors are the obvious way to do concurrency. Just like a sibling comment I think you comment confuses the comparison. The semantic difference is between threads _and_ actors vs callbacks.<p>An actor is a sequential context, ideally isolated, but it can run concurrently with other actors (that are themselves actors). Think of group of entities in a game. Each one executes some simplified sequence of operations. Do x, do y, do z, then go back to x. But there multiple such entities in parallel. Another example is handling web requests. A web GET request is dispatched a new actor is spawned. They read the request body,  process it, read some data from database maybe and return the response -- very sequential. But there are multiple potential such requests running concurrently.<p>Callbacks also form sequences of calls but there is no explicit concurrency context, and if sequence is simple it works ok, but it if it is not it is very easy to get tangled. You are processing one sequence but another piece of input comes in and a parallel sequence of callbacks has started, unless the data is immutable and you have pure functions at some point it becomes a tangled mess.<p>> With higher-level concurrency models we end up screaming at our IDEs as we try to contort our code to fit the paradigm.<p>That is why you&#x27;d want to run isolated concurrency contexts (actors). You can do this by making copies of data and storing it locally. Talking to threads via queues only. Spawning OS processes. That is how you decompose a highly concurrent system. Using callbacks is not going to fix the problem is only going to make it worse.",1381945695

Prior to age 16 you&#x27;d be studying for exams in 6-10 subjects: originally &#x27;O&#x27; (ordinary) levels, then GCSEs. (School leaving age was 16.) If you wanted to continue and eventually go to university, you then went on to study for 2 years for &#x27;A&#x27; (advanced) level exams -- roughly equivalent to year 1 or 2 at a US university. (British taught university degrees were typically 3 year courses.) However, this was intensive enough that typically you&#x27;d only take 3 or 4 &#x27;A&#x27; level subjects. This forced early specialization -- dropping either all science or all arts subjects.<p>(This system ran from the late 1940s through the 1990s, subject to fine-tuning.

The Republican talking points are trying to compare Obama show-voting against the debt limit, or Tip O&#x27;Neil negotiating with Reagan, but in those circumstances, there was never the threat to take the government to the edge of the deadline.<p>Prior to the recent crop of idealogue Republicans in the House, much political compromise came about by horse trading legislation, earmarks, committee appointments, et al, behind closed doors. Now with earmarks mostly gone, Tea Party republicans have nothing to show off to their constituents except for achievements in idealogical concessions from the other side. This is a new and dangerous precedent because &quot;compromise&quot; on idealogy appears as a loss to one&#x27;s radical constituents.

The distinction is between threads/actors vs callbacks. Not threads and callbacks vs actors.<p>If you disregard isolated heaps and memory an actor is just a thread plus a queue. Other threads write to the queue and the threads gets messages from queue and executes them.<p>The real distinction is callbacks vs threads and actors thought. And I agree with original point. Callback-based concurrency is more complicated and more challenging to write than threaded-based concurrency.<p>> Also, in lots of languages multi-core != concurrent. You can have 10,000 actors using a single core. In fact writing a scheduler that can efficiently distribute actors between different cores is probably where the complexity Doron Rajwan refers to lies.<p>What do you mean by multi-core? Languages don&#x27;t come with cores, hardware does. Do you mean that CPU-bound units of concurrency (threads, actors, processes, co-routines) can be dispatched onto multiple CPUs if those exist? Yeah some languages (or more precisely their runtimes and libraries) can&#x27;t do that. Like Python has the GIL so CPU bound threads can&#x27;t work.

This article seems to claim that Europe didn&#x27;t surpass China until the 1800s. Why then did math, astronomy and other sciences, and natural philosophy not originate in China, but centuries earlier in Europe (with a loose definition of &quot;originate&quot;, I know Europeans were not the first)? Most of Chinese philosophy seems to me to be mostly about society and the duty of men etc. I&#x27;m sure China excelled at organizing an efficient society with a comparatively huge population, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that they were on the cusp of something bigger. Perhaps they were at a local optimum as a society. And while Europe was worse off early on, it allowed the region to discover math and science AND make USE of it. China had a big fleet, but cancelled the project. China invented printing but it did not push literacy. China invented gun powder, but they didn&#x27;t use it to gain a military advantage.  Traditional Chinese Medicine used penicillin indirectly, but never managed to understand or extract it. China is a sea of lost opportunities, it&#x27;s not as simple as blaming it on opium and intervening western powers.<p>edit: it seems that further down this article gives more explanations and actually states that China was in stagnation from 1200 onwards.

6560918,comment,6560085,6560624,16,0,lkrubner,,,"You get at the degree to which all human knowledge is limited by the central nervous system that humans possess. There must be some finite number of axons and dendrites that can be stuffed into the cranium of a human, and even if there is a sophisticated system of compression and/or multiplexing in use, we can probably assume that a finite amount of axons and dendrites can only carry a finite amount of information.<p>Thinking of the physical limits on human knowledge leads to a model of knowing that puts the central nervous system at the center of our our experience of the universe. There may be an absolute reality that exists outside of us, but since all of us are human (I assume) we must admit that our knowledge of that absolute reality will forever be shaped by that central nervous system.<p>The limits of the central nervous system cause humans to look for models of reality that fit well with those limits. For instance, there is The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_or_Minus_Two"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Magical_Number_Seven,_Plus_...</a><p>Because of the (very very finite) limits on working memory, the human mind leans heavily on heuristics that allow simple models to stand in for the complexity of reality. No human being could easily work with a physics model that had 1 million variables: therefore we tend to look for models that have a handful of variables, yet still give us reasonably good estimates.<p>Just yesterday there was posted to Hacker News an article about a slinky, and that article contains a good demonstration of the kind of simplifying assumptions we often make to reason about problems that are too complex to approach directly:<p>&quot;I decided to idealize the problem like this: the slinky is an ideal spring with mass distributed uniformly throughout. It is also a spring that can pass through itself. These assumptions make analyzing the problem easier.&quot;<p>And of course, we often present students with problems where the difficulty of achieving perfect measurements of variables is simply assumed away. For instance in this exercise:<p><a href=""http://www.uta.edu/ce/nsf/ret/docs/lesson-plans/reynolds08-5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uta.edu/ce/nsf/ret/docs/lesson-plans/reynolds08-5...</a><p>The important things to measure are: force, deflection, torque, moment of inertia, stress and strain. Often, in real life situations, engineers have no way to perfectly measure these things. Large engineering projects proceed with various methods for getting reasonable estimates: known upper and lower bounds, prototypes, isolated testing of particular connections, etc.<p>The smartest people alive never get to the point where they really know reality, they only know estimates. I do not mean to make this point overly philosophical, I am talking about practicalities here: there may be an absolute reality that we can know directly, but when it comes to doing anything useful, we develop estimates using fairly simple models, models which are well suited to the limits of our minds.<p>In some sense, the models we build about the world are always simplified models that make it easier for our limited central nervous systems to make estimates about the world.<p>I just offered a physics examples of simplifying assumptions, but I could also focus on the humanities. Perhaps your life&#x27;s goal is to figure out the &quot;real&quot; reasons why the French Revolution happened, or why Communism was so popular for so long, or why the Industrial Revolution happened -- the possibilities are as limitless as the combination of all the variables in action over the course of centuries, the psychology and biology of billions of people, and the technology that existed at the time, and the weather and the crops and the economy and the religions and the amount of sunlight reaching the earth and everything else, combining exponentially to some very large sum. You might research the issue for 40 years, but in the end, if you want to draw some useful conclusion, something that others can benefit from, something that might influence policymakers in the future, you will need to come up with a simplified model that focuses on the handful of variables that you regard as the most important.<p>There is another model of knowing, which takes for granted the absolute reality outside of us. That model is well summarized by this XKCD comic:<p><a href=""http://xkcd.com/435/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/435/</a><p>In that model, biology is a sub-branch of physics, which is a sub-branch of math. However, if you focus on the limits of the central nervous system as the practical limit of human knowing, then you end up with a model where physics and math (and everything else) is a sub-branch of biology, specifically, a sub-branch of neurology. Even the two models of human knowing that I describe in this post to Hacker News can be thought of as sub-branches of neurology. All human knowing is, in some sense, a clever hack of our neurology, and certainly all heuristics and models are hacks which adapt to the limits of that neurology.<p>There is nothing wrong with simple models, so long as they allow us to get useful work done. But I think our reliance on simple models tells us why specialization is so important. If a person can study a subject for 40 years and, having read tens of thousands of documents, still distills the data down to a small handful of variables, a model that gracefully adapts to the limits of the human mind, then we must admit that it is the rare human being who goes much beyond simple models. In those cases where simple models don&#x27;t work, and where there only thing that works is a model with hundreds or thousands of variables, then clearly, achieving an understanding of such models must surely be the work of a lifetime. You need to get to studying when you are 20, and you need to specialize, because when you are 50 you will still be only approaching the ideal, never quite there, only approaching it, still learning more.",1381944513

It didn&#x27;t teach how to write a persuasive proposal in a business context, string together a logically-sound argument, or form inferences from empirical data, and taught very little about contemporary politics or recent American or world history. It didn&#x27;t teach how to mediate an interpersonal conflict at work, delegate a task, or effectively communicate an idea in a presentation.
I lament that I spent so much time &quot;learning&quot; in school and have so little to show for it. I know about different kinds of cloud formations, which extinct native American cultures lived where, the difference between the soil composition in different parts of the country, spectral lines in different gasses, etc. This is trivia.<p>The point is to learn how to &#x27;learn&#x27;.

What could even remotely be educational about learning the traditions and regulations of annual company reports or recent fads in employee evaluations?  Creative writing could go either way depending on if its oriented more toward the rules of the game or the general ideas / concepts / outlook of synthesizing something meaningful out of multiple ideas.<p>Data analysis goes either way.  Of course &quot;this is how to use R, this is how to use excel, this is how to make a graph for a presentation&quot; is purely vocational.  If you go into the theory of how to think about what and why you&#x27;re doing it, that at least could be educational.  Algebra is a tough one to talk about but if you&#x27;re willing to talk Trig its trivial to provide vocational training (plug and chug this memorized formula to drill a bolt hole circle or survey a plot of land without understanding how it works or what it means or how to apply it to other tasks) vs educational (notice how often pi appears in trig, now why is that?  Well it seems all this has something to do with unit circles.  And isn&#x27;t it interesting that pi is irrational, and coincidentally your trig approximations have various infinite fraction representations and there seems to be a relationship there.  And when you&#x27;re willing to go multidimensional, what does all this 2-D and 3-D stuff imply about higher dimensions?  And why are Quaternions showing up here and what is a noncommutative division algebra anyhow?  And why would a 4-dimensional number system (sorta) turn out to actually simplify rotating 3-d stuff when intuitively adding a dimension should just make it more complicated not less)<p>This is massively confused because we send 1/2 or so of our population for &quot;education&quot; but demand they merely be &quot;trained&quot; because what they need vocationally is, no coincidence, vocational training.  And it all comes from historical cultural background where only the idle rich had the lack of need and spare time to be educated, therefore the way to be upwardly mobile is to get an education, although you&#x27;d still like a job, so better scrap the education and demand vocational training from an educational institution.<p>To a crude first approximation, vocational training is what gives you skills you can trade for money on the job, or perhaps if unemployed, as a hobby, but an education gives you something &quot;worthwhile and interesting&quot; to think about, and if you can make money off it thats nice but its not the purpose at all.

The arguments in favour of higher-level concurrency models are basically the same as for tests and version control: if you don&#x27;t use them, you&#x27;re making a dangerous gamble which may cause a large price down the road.<p>Concurrency models like callbacks and actors can make dangerous things more difficult; if we use the callback examples from the article:<p>> Its hard for a programmer to reason about which line of code executes on which thread, and passing information from one callback to another is cumbersome as well.<p>Of course, this is the point of callbacks. The callback model tells us to reason using function arguments and function calls, so of course we can&#x27;t map lines of code to threads, since neither lines of code or thread have any place in a callback model. Likewise for passing data between callbacks; the problem with threads is that everything is shared all of the time, which makes it incredibly difficult to enforce invariants. When using callbacks, everything is local by default and transfering data between threads requires explicit channels, eg. free variables.<p>In the actor model the safety comes from messages having no ordering or latency guarantees, so we can&#x27;t assume that our data is always up to date.<p>With higher-level concurrency models we end up screaming at our IDEs as we try to contort our code to fit the paradigm. This is how it should be, since this means nothing&#x27;s gone wrong.<p>With low-level concurrency models, the machine gladly accepts our dangerously broken code, the number of interleavings is so huge that our tests never hit an error case (or more likely, some of the bugs are so obscure that it never occurred to us to test them).

It&#x27;s not that you&#x27;re skipping foundation knowledge, but you&#x27;re just learning one core piece.  Instead of learning the area under an encyclopedia of curves, you learn integral calculus and you&#x27;re done.  Instead of memorizing thousands of rules involving the interaction of various charged objects, you learn Maxwell&#x27;s four equations and you&#x27;re done.  Or, you could learn geometric calculus and then only need to learn one four-symbol equation.  Instead of learning thousands of different circuits to accomplish thousands of different tasks, you learn one Turing machine.<p>Knowledge is constantly increasing, but we&#x27;re also continually finding that a large amount of our previous knowledge was redundant.  I once saw a great article, that I wish I could find again, list off a series of scientific laws that could all be derived from nothing but unit analysis.  The circle grow larger, but our steps do as well.",1381943193

6560760,comment,6560214,6560214,65,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Nice exemplar. Back when Java was being created, James Gosling was pretty insistent that concurrency be lightweight and scalable. When I ported it from SunOS 4 so Solaris 2.0 I had to move from the really light weight setjump()/longjmp() threads that he had implemented, into the thread system that Solaris had defined. There was a huge negative impact on performance (as I recall about 15x slower). That sucked because one of the coolest demos at the time had a little world in it where &#x27;Fang&#x27; (the Java mascot) lived and a bunch of things in that world were all animated with threads. Looking at the &#x27;fiber&#x27; model for threads I think they are much closer to what we should have done in the first place.<p>The thought was to have a billion threads on a SPARCStation 10 (that is like an old Pentium machine now). We never got close but it was a great goal. Definitely going to have to go back and revisit this topic now. Thanks for the excellent demo to play with!",1381942912

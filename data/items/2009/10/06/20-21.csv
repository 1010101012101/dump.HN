865208,comment,864979,865147,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""From what I have read autism is a condition in which inputs cause the child to feel strong emotions that are not necessarily rational. I don't see that cannabis would cause the child to think in a rational manner unless it was to cause him/her to focus on things more.""<p>I think this is probably a symptom of what I described above, rather than the root cause. Read Temple Grandin's book Animals in Translation if you want a better account.<p>The book is written by an autistic woman who discovered that she has a really uncanny ability to understand animals. Basically she is able to see which stimuli are causing cattle and other animals to freak out, and the way she is able to do this is because her perception of the world is altered in a way that makes these stimuli (and their effects) more salient. For example, she will realize that the reason the cow won't move is because it sees a shadow, which no one else can recognize even though it's right in front of them. Apparently both autistics and animals are set off by some of the same things, because they don't have the natural ability to generalize phenomena. (So if they see a shadow, it's like a completely new thing to them each time and it scares them.) Although it seems like this particular author has learned to intellectualize that ability, so as an adult she has learned to get around the fact that the part of her brain which is supposed to do that isn't working. Anyway I'd really recommend this book, it sounds really flaky but it's incredibly intellectually interesting, and has so many implications for so many things it's ridiculous.<p>(Note that there may be several types of autism, which science hasn't yet differentiated because people could be having different subjective experiences, while the behavioral outcomes are the same. I'm not saying this is the case, it's just a possibility that has to be kept in mind, because people as introspective and articulate as Grandin are rare so understanding in these areas moves slowly.)",1254861950

You can be the most silent, rights knowledgeable person and still get screwed by Federal law.<p>I'm currently reading a book titled ""Three Felonies a Day"" which details how the federal criminal system is broken.  The book itself unfortunately is a series of anecdotes, rather than a deeper analysis of how we got to this situation.  If you can find it at the library, I recommend skimming a few of the stories to get a feel for what's going on.<p>I'm obviously not a lawyer, but as far as I understand, federal law does not require a ""guilty mind"" (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea</a>), at least not to the same degree that traditional state law requires.  In addition, many federal crimes are written very vaguely, sometimes to good effect (handling unforeseen criminal acts, obviously wrong, but not specifically banned by law), but more often to ill effect (yeah, that's fraud!).<p>Then, finally, there is the issue of the approach federal prosecutors take in pursuing cases, in which the push for convictions is more important than the push for justice.  This results in approaches to cases such as ""ladder climbing"", where you indict the lower rungs of an organization (mayor's aids for example) with the threat of years of jail, and have them plea bargain out to almost nothing in exchange to testify against the person above them.  Often, the choice for the person being accused is so obviously one sided that they'll creatively spin their testimony so that innocent behavior suddenly because ""fraud"" or ""obstruction of justice"" or similarly vague crimes.<p>One more sneaky thing that federal prosecutors do is that certain things are crimes, even where not obvious.  For instance, lying under oath is obviously a crime (perjury).  Lying to a federal officer while not under oath is also a crime (a felony no less).<p>So basically, federal prosecutors can pin very serious crimes on almost anybody they wish, as this article pointed out with import/export restrictions about flowers.",1254860312

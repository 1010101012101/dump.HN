The lyrics just didn't seem nearly as offensive as most people apparently find them in light of this clearly being either the actual Scooter or someone copying them - I'm assuming the latter, because the lyrics seem a bit too juvenile even for Scooter, but knowing the band and their typical over-the-top raver campiness certainly mitigated the offensiveness of the incident.

...
Unfortunately, hot deployment has never been 100 percent reliable, and the web server often still has to perform expensive recompilation of code.""<p>- Last I checked
 i) the hot deployment in Tomcat/Jetty/SBT/etc is pretty solid, especially if we are talking development.
 ii) Java supports incremental compilation which means you only need to compile what has been changed, especially if we are still taking development phase again. Unless you compile after making changes to 100+ files, I don't see how expensive this step can be.<p>""Generally speaking, Java-based web frameworks dont reliably allow you to have a fast turnaround time for your changes. But that isnt the only concern with Java-based web frameworks. Another factor that slows down rapid web development is the flexibility of the language, and this is where static typing can be a drawback.""<p>- This argument about dynamic typing faster/better than static typing is just BS. Each offers it's own advantages and can be better/faster depending on where/when/how you apply it and how good a developer are you at actually using their power. Your first example of changing number value to have decimal precision can be achieved in static typing languages like Java/C# just as fast and reliably when one uses refactoring. Your second example of changing list of Book objects to a list of BookOrToy objects, could have been avoided all together by coding to interfaces and not concrete objects. If that has failed, refactoring again solves this.",1339324024

The thinking that whatever the project at hand may be, a Java based solution is always the correct answer and there is nothing to learn from alternative platforms. I've heard ""Why would anyone want to use anything other than Spring?"" or ""C# is shit"" more than once. However, if you were to compare the experience of using Spring + Eclipse to C# + ASP.MVC + Visual Studio, you'd have to be pretty set in your ways not to admit that the latter is a much nicer platform to work with and that the Java eco-system shouldn't take something away from it. Having a standard web framework (ASP.MVC) makes .NET teams miles more efficient than the framework fragmentation that is Java web dev.<p>And if you're comparing it to Rails or Django, I honestly don't think you can easily find a 3 or 4 engineer Spring team that could deliver a product as good (or scalable) as Instragram in the 2 years it took them to do it in Django.

4090701,comment,4090298,4090298,2,0,jfaucett,,,"As a young developer (early 20's) I think Java's lack of usage in webdev has to do with several ""problems"".
1.) Java has the rep of being bloated and slow. (At least when compared to C/C++)
2.) Related to #1, almost all the tools the majority of webdevers use are written in C/C++ and not Java. For instance, Apache, Nginx, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, SQLite, Webkit, V8 - which gives me the feeling that using/improving C/C++ gives me a better understanding of my toolset whereas Java doesn't have any perceived added benefit.
3.) For Application Development itself, using scripting languages like Ruby/Python/PHP makes for BLAZING fast development especially when using a framework like Rails.
4.) The LAMP Stack (if implemented correctly) can handle a LOT of traffic, I'm talking millions of daily users.<p>So this leaves almost every web developer (I'd say around 98%) with no reason to use Java - ever. Why should they? With the current tools, I can build highly scalable apps extremely fast and because I'm using scripting languages I'm free to experiment, mix/match, combine, and build new tools in innovative ways. Also, I think because Java is associated with the group of C/C++ and ""lower level"" languages it really does loose cred simply because it can't compete in effeciency terms with those languages.<p>Personally, as a programmer who loves C, Ruby and Haskell (so yea I'm biased but who isn't?) just looking at the Syntax of Java makes me seriously wonder what Sun was thinking.",1339323353

Instead of preparing to fight a lost battle, they firmly anchor themselves in the upper segment of the market, hoping that copycats will fight for the low margin entry level market.<p>Therefore, Uber's market share is much lower than it could be: they're after the patrons they'll be able to keep for the long term, not after every taxi patrons. I believe that copycats preying on the whole taxi industry's patronship will soon come and storm the market, though, unless lobbyists manage to kill the legal loopholes fast enough.",1339322999

  evenNumbers = array.where(x => !(x % 2))

Now think of how to write that code not using lambdas.<p>In Java where people seem to like typing unnecessary stuff it would make sense to not have lambdas as then you can type extra stuff. Also lambdas would reduce KLOCs thus making teams using java with lambdas less productive.<p>This is similar to the reduced productivity seen by teams using scala or clojure on the JVM.<p>Also, OOP has nothing to do with procedural or functional languages, it's completely orthogonal.",1339322671

You have to enjoy the process first, and if you plan to show your work to other people, or publish it, then you go into the curation and editing process. No photographer goes out, takes one picture, and it's a hit. No author writes a book and it's a worthy book from the first draft. Often the meaning of the work shows itself while you're creating it. Or you will find a theme, a meaning while doing random shiznit. And really the most important part for me is to enjoy it, else why would I do it?

Don't know if there is a way to use different launch image based on some value.<p>Using at least some spacing between the keys is necessary otherwise it's easy to hit another key by mistake.

4090670,comment,4090498,4090614,3,0,mtgx,,,"I remember there was a lot of misunderstanding about Google's revenues from Android when everyone started writing articles about it a few months ago. Most of their ""facts"" came from 2010, when Google still had like 4% of the US market, and Apple had like 20-23%. And somehow they extrapolated that to mean that Google also makes 4x less from Android <i>right now</i>. But Google has grown much faster than Apple since then, and by now Google has caught up even with the total amount of iOS devices (iPhone, iPod touch, iPad), and they both have around 350 million devices on the market. So it's very unlikely that Google is still making much less from Android than they do from iOS.<p>There's another similar kind of misunderstanding whenever Apple releases the ""money they have paid to developers"". First they forget that Apple only ever mentions the <i>total</i> amount they have paid since the App Store was created in 2008.<p>They also forget that again, Apple had a huge headstart in both number of apps and in number of units in the market until late 2010 or so, and that only more recently they've had about the same amount of apps and number of units in the market as Apple.<p>So when you compare the ""total amount"" Apple has paid to devs to Google's ""total amount"" that they paid to devs, obviously Apple will come out on top because of their huge headstart in the first 2-3 years. But if you compare the last quarter or last year for both, which is a lot more relevant for devs, because they'd want to know how much they can make right now, Apple might still come out on top, but the difference should be a lot smaller, and definitely not something like $3 billion vs $100 million.<p>Hopefully the ""Apple media"" will remember this before they start slamming Google when Apple will release their new numbers, without really understanding the context of those numbers.",1339322484

That you can do with lambdas, through customizing ""the thing"". Without lambdas, you are left with the requirement to painfully and painstakingly get bits and pieces in or out of objects in order to do the thing yourself, ending up with a horrendously procedural language with a smattering of objects added on top.<p>It's no secret  or mistake  that blocks are first-class components (and literals[0]) in the ur-OO language: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Code_blocks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk#Code_blocks</a> (as well as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)</a> )<p>[0] and really one of the few pieces of syntax",1339322413

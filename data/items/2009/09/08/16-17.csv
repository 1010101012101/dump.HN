Here is the link:<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/hans_rosling_reveals_new_insights_on_poverty.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/hans_rosling_reveals_new_i...</a><p>He discusses the trends. The first few minutes are about child mortality, income and changes over the last few centuries. [Edit: Also see from 14 minutes. Hell, see all of it. If you care about the developing world, it is really informative.]<p>>That's due to technological progress<p>Afaik, the industrial revolution needed capitalism. Any references otherwise?<p>But sure, the technology and the scientific method has been invented. Inefficient systems can grind along for a bit, until we in the open world outcompete them.<p>For countries to be rich enough not to have starving, they need capitalism and good governance.<p>>around 1 billion people starve today, that's not a small percentage IMHO:<p>This have the usual idealist problem -- you have to kill people to help them...<p>Let us split that value up, a bit. About a billion is hungry, according to Wikipedia (<i>not</i> the same as starving -- did you fake there?).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage_of_population_suffering_from_undernourishment"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_percentage...</a><p>Let us get some absolute numbers:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition#Malnutrition_demographics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malnutrition#Malnutrition_demog...</a><p>Top three: India, 217.05. China, 154.0. Bangladesh, 43.45. That is, 400 millions of that billion.<p>Now, China is a communist country, so the real value is probably higher -- but they are implementing capitalism so the hunger will go away in less than two-three decades (unless the governance is too bad).<p>India will probably solve their own hunger problems if they can get good governance to work.<p>We can ignore India/China, because they (a) can solve their own problems and (b) both have nuclear weapons and would not take kindly to external forced solutions.<p>Bangladesh -- will never solve their hunger problems by themselves. It is generally held to be the most corrupt country on the planet and the politicians steal aid money. You can't solve the problems of Bangladesh without military intervention -- see Iraq, how that goes.<p>Note that with that population density, a Bangladeshi invasion would kill more people than starvation in decades...<p>You have no clue how to organize an intervention to China, India and Bangladesh. And how to sell it, without military intervention. And <i>NO ONE ELSE HAS A CLUE, EITHER</i>.<p>The next two in the ""top"" list: Congo/Pakistan (with 37.0/35 millions hungry) have civil wars/insurrections. Good luck solving that, without killing more than hunger will, in decades.<p>The rest of the big hunger case is Africa south of the Sahari desert.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Hunger_Index#Conflicts_exacerbate_hunger"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Hunger_Index#Conflicts_e...</a><p>""War and violence have been the major causes of widespread poverty and food insecurity in most of the countries with high GHI scores.""<p>Well, as I said, you have an Iraq situation if you try to solve those cases...<p>(Tanzania might be a case. It is peaceful and has 16 million hungry, but it has gotten foreign aid by billions and billions since decades. It seems to be either too corrupt or too damaged by the early attempt at socialism... Might be a case where aid might be better used. I don't know enough about Ethiopia, but they have 30+ million hungry... might be fixable. But that and Tanzania is 3% [edit: 5%, didn't add] of your billion.)<p>So, most of the hungry will either be solved by themselves (India, China, Vietnam) with capitalism -- or will need a military intervention to change the governments (and/or stop conflicts which generate the starvation).<p>Especially good luck with Zimbabwe, South Africa would probably start a war with the military intervention needed to get rid of the b-stards in government, that starves their population.<p>And about changing the world system:<p>Consider East Germany. West Germany tried to integrate it and really, really failed. You want to do the same for the whole world? Abolish winter too, please... [Edit: Note that East Germany volunteered, the governments you want to reach are those that won't...]<p>I consider your thesis that hunger could [Edit: fixed word] be solved crushed and killed. I winz.<p>I think you are either a troll or ridiculously naive.<p>Edit: As an additional note:<p>>> You don't have to wait generations to curb starvation. In Cuba they managed in a decade. That's the issue here: Either we do it on our own accord or one day people will take their fair share by force and that leads to dictatorships.<p>First, Cuba <i>is</i> already a dictatorship which locks in its population, so they don't go to better places. Second, people in democracies with good governance don't generally starve (as I noted above). Third, that was according to Cuban statistics (see Soviet statistics from the 1930s...)<p>(To anser the next comment -- Cuba had to lock in their population before 1989 too, when they had both trade partners and lots of aid.)<p>Edit 2: Some parenthese. And as a last note, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation#Hunger_statistics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation#Hunger_statistics</a><p>In 1970, 37% of the population in the developing world was ""hungry"", in 2007 it was 17%. (And as I noted above, the large majority of the remaining are in countries which will solve it themselves -- or the results of military conflicts/dictators. Hard to go in and ""fix"", both of those cases.)<p>Sigh, i guess I have been trolled but good to answer this whining. Enough.",1252429139

811367,comment,810484,810798,0,0,gjm11,,,"What is your evidence that the subtle effects of advertising aren't harmful?<p><i>What you're saying is that most people more often than not are influenced to make decisions that are not good for them or their families?</i> Yes. Not, of course, because every advertisement anyone ever sees is pushing them in a bad direction -- of course sometimes you'll see advertisements for something that really would benefit you -- but because the overall effect is bad. Seeing or hearing an advertisement does two things to you. (1) It provides you with some new information: such-and-such a product exists, you can get it in such-and-such a place, it has features X and Y and Z, it costs $P, etc. (2) It attempts to make you want to buy the product by other means besides merely informing you about it. It's an empirical question how these two balance out. Take a look at some advertisements, look at their actual information content, and see what <i>you</i> think the ratio between the two is: I reckon probably 10:1 in favour of those ""other means"". So, now, if I'm exposed to a bunch of advertisements then I get some extra information that helps me make a more informed choice, but I also get manipulated in ways that advertisers think effective enough to spend billions on. And it looks like there's much more of the latter than the former. Sometimes the manipulation will be towards things that really benefit me. Sometimes, not so much. There isn't likely to be much correlation between the manipulation and what's actually in my interests. (Actually, what would be needed for the ads to benefit me would be a correlation between the manipulation and the <i>difference</i> between what's in my interests and what I'd guess for myself without the ads. Very, very unlikely, I think.) So, basically I get a whole lot of noise injected into my decision-making process. Or, in other words, I get made sillier and stupider.<p><i>empirical evidence suggests that people at large don't systematically make bad decisions</i>: I would be interested to see this empirical evidence of which you speak. I am skeptical of its existence.<p><i>advertising on a grand scale sharpens the awareness that there might be a better solution</i>: yup, I expect it does, and that may be a benefit. It seems to me like a benefit that's heavily outweighed by the dangers of being made ""aware"" that something is a better solution when it actually isn't.<p><i>I do think that, yes, that is thinking ""too highly of their own virtue""</i>: Well, that's very strange to me, since the thing you're describing in that way says precisely nothing at all about the virtue (or cleverness, or anything) of the perseon who's making the claim.<p><i>I don't think anyone has any right to tell me ...</i>: Er, I wasn't suggesting that anyone should be complaining at you about the decisions you make. Nor that paying more money for brand-name clothes from fancy shops is a decision you shouldn't be making.<p><i>there's something wrong with picking a fight on behalf of someone else, saying that</i>: Why? Here's a concrete counterexample (as it seems to me) that may help us work out where our disagreement is coming from. Consider someone engaged in outright fraud -- a 419 scammer, let's say. Suppose this person is new to the job but very good at what they do. At the moment they have hundreds of victims whom they're stringing along, bleeding money from; but all these victims are happy about what's being done to them because they expect to get rich. Now, suppose you discover this scam. Is it wrong for you to publicize it, and denounce the scammer to the police or other relevant authority? I say: no, of course it isn't, even though it involves picking a fight on the behalf of other people on the grounds that they're being fooled into doing something that isn't in their best interests. How about you?<p><i>legitimizing reckless actions by blaming advertising</i>: Neither I nor Bertrand Russell (it's not often that one gets to say <i>that</i>...) is ""legitimizing reckless actions"" here, so far as I can see. And perhaps I'm being dim, but it seems to me that you're now making exactly the sort of complaint about what others do that you earlier called ""holier-than-thou"".",1252429023

Mine is very much like the Yike: underseat steering, approximately 20"" wheels, short wheelbase, and I sit almost directly over the front wheel (like the Yike) except I have to pedal.  Here is what I know:<p>1. sitting on a wheel means every time you hit a pothole you say yike as your spine is pounded.<p>2. you MUST keep both hands on the wheel at all times because it is dynamically unstable (very different from an 'upright' bike which will steer hands-free).<p>3. forward center of gravity will dump you on your face under heavy braking (or for the Yike - the slightest braking).<p>4. small wheels feel every bump in the pavement (which has a fractal dimension explored in greater detail as the wheel gets smaller).<p>5. You can ride a recumbent for hundreds of miles in a day and still be very comfortable (I have) but it requires a chair-type seat; preferably with some recline to it.  That seat looks painful.<p>6. A short wheelbase like my bike or the Yike allows you to turn on a dime - but it takes practice as both wheels do not have the same weight and a skid is unrecoverable.  Do not attempt this on ice, snow, wet leaves, etc..",1252427162

811297,comment,811283,811283,0,0,jbenz,,,"Greetings.  I was the interactive designer (among other jobs) for Customized Graphics. We're trying to be the Cafe Press or Zazzle for custom vinyl products, including Giant Wall Graphics, Bumper Stickers, and Banners.<p>I work for a small company called eRetailing in Columbus, Ohio.  Customized Graphics is a tremendous opportunity for us.  We're treating it like a start-up within a start-up.<p>eRetailing has had some success in the custom apparel space, and now we're moving on to other custom products like stickers and wall graphics.  There have  been a couple questions on HN in the past about where to find custom stickers for your business.  Well, you can absolutely find them here.<p>We think we're special for a few reasons:<p>1) When we were building this site there was no one else operating as the Cafe Press of Wall Graphics.  Just recently, LTLPrints launched with a similar model.  I've seen them mentioned on here before and it looks like they have a great product.  We're looking forward to the competition!<p>2)  Our Design Center is delightfully robust.  It’s very easy to add your own text and art and then change colors, fonts, sizes, and more.  You can also upload images, including vector art.  (We think we’re the only place where you can upload vector art to create custom products, which is important for large graphics because vector art scales.) (See: <a href=""http://www.customizedgraphics.com/designcenter/Wall_Graphics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.customizedgraphics.com/designcenter/Wall_Graphics</a>)<p>3)  We represent the next step in online customization.  For example, at Café Press and Zazzle you can shop from thousands of family-themed designs.  But none of those designs are actually customizable.  But clicking on one of our designs sends you directly to our design center, where you can edit text, colors, and everything else.  So if you find a family wall graphic you like, it’s incredibly simple to click ""Edit"" and add your own family name.  (See: <a href=""http://www.customizedgraphics.com/search/all/Family"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.customizedgraphics.com/search/all/Family</a>)<p>Thanks in advance for any feedback!  Everything still  needs a lot of testing and improvement.",1252426750

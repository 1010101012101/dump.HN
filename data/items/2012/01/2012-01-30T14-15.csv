3529009,comment,3528011,3528637,2,0,dkersten,,,"Indeed, my application did not require cache coherency or shared memory.<p>In fact, what we ended up doing was basically a message passing system between the commodity machines in the cluster, so each node processed messages independently. Each node maintained its own shared (between messages processed on that node, but not between nodes) state and if a message which needed this state was on a different node, it was transferred to the correct node (using a distributed hash table to know which node to transfer to). Since we could tell very early during the messages processing if it requires access to the shared state or not (we knew more or less by message type), this was very efficient. There was a little more to it for redundancy and fault tolerance, but that's the basic strategy we followed and it does not require shared memory or cache coherency at all, like you correctly identified, which is why we didn't need Tilera and were able to meet our goals on a commodity hardware cluster.<p>When I said my application was a good fit, I really meant that it was embarrassingly parallel enough to make good use of a lot of cores - not that it required or benefited from anything else that the Tilera hardware would have given us.",1327935563

3529007,comment,3527752,3527995,1,0,lkrubner,,,"""So 'stranger danger' seems like it's been around since it became mainstream for minors to use the internet""<p>Yes, but when was that? There is a dramatic change in scale between 1995 and 2005, regarding how many people had easy access to the Internet.<p>When she writes of the moral panic, she is not referring to moments when individual parents expressed concern about what their children were doing online, but rather, she is writing about when the media focused on this story. I agree the media emphasized reasons to be afraid of the Internet ever since the Internet emerged in the 90s, but there was an exaggerated emphasis in the mid 00s when it became the easiest way for lazy journalists to frame a story about the Internet.<p>I'm under the impression boyd is also talking about the period of time when youth in the USA faced increasing restrictions regarding their physical movement, and increased supervision from parents. Consider what boyd writes here:<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=w092y1Y6ut4C&oi=fnd&pg=PA1&dq=danah+boyd+moral+panic&ots=FCpJMtCNLJ&sig=DGsr53BqPJUI10iH54P_S1IQbnA#v=onepage&q&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=w092y1Y6u...</a><p>She also wrote the following (several paragraphs) about MySpace in 2006:<p>MySpace is in a different position, one far more harrowing. MySpace has grown so large that the needs, values and practices of its users are slamming into each other. It's facing the archetypical clashing of cultures. Yet, interestingly, most users are not that concerned - they're trying to figure out how to live in this super public. The challenge is that outsiders are panicking about a culture that they are not a part of. They want to kill the super public rather than support people in learning how to negotiate it. No one knows how to live in such a super public, but this structure is going to become increasingly a part of our lives. It is no wonder that youth want to figure it out. And it is critical that they do, especially since our physical worlds have become more segregated and walled off, partitioned by age, race, class, religion, values, etc. Yet, it is the older generation that did that segregating and they're not really ready to face collapsed contexts at every turn or to learn how to engage with people who have very different values on a daily basis. Because of their position of power, outsiders are pushing the big red emergency button, screaming danger and creating a complete and utter moral panic. Welcome to a generational divide, where adults are unable to see the practices of their children on kids' terms.<p>If MySpace falters in the next 1-2 years, it will be because of this moral panic. Before all of you competitors get motivated to exacerbate the moral panic, think again. If the moral panic succeeds:<p>Youth will lose (even more) freedom of speech. How far will the curtailment of the First Amendment go?<p>All users will lose the safety and opportunities of pseudonymity, particularly around political speech and particularly internationally.<p>Internet companies will be required to confirm the real life identity of all users. At their own cost.<p>International growth on social communities will be massively curtailed because it is much harder to confirm non-US populations.<p>Internet companies will lose the protections of common carrier which will have ramifications in all sorts of directions.<p>Internet companies will see a massive increase in subpoenas and will be forced to turn over data on their users which will in turn destroy the trust relationship between companies and users.<p>There will be a much greater barrier for new communities to form and for startups to build out new social environments.<p>International companies will be far better positioned to create new social technologies because they won't have to abide by American laws even if American citizens use their technology (assuming the servers are hosted outside of the US). Unless, of course, we decide to block sites on a nation-wide basis....<p><a href=""http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html</a>",1327935541

If the situation really is that 90% of people need some sort of intervention to reach the desired mental functioning, then we could just say that and argue for it openly; the pro-nootropics community makes those kinds of arguments, for example.

I wish he would check finishing times for some local races, see how much the powerlifters at his gym are lifting, or visit a local Crossfit affiliate.  Where did he get the idea that it is so easy to ""excel"" these days?  The word can be used without an object, but it is inherently comparative.  The gym provides me a lot of satisfaction and physical benefits, but comparing myself physically to other people is a not a benefit but a pitfall.  It's the one thing at the gym that can ruin my day.  ""Why do I come here?  I will never be like that guy... or that guy... or that guy.""  I will never be 6'4"" and have an eight-pack.  I will never squat 500 lbs.  I will never have a killer Murph time (look it up.)  I will never qualify for the Boston marathon.  Well, that last one I could perhaps do, but only by giving up many other things I value more highly.  The impulse to excel argues <i>against</i> working out the way I want, which is to work out three times a week and enjoy the health and appearance benefits.<p>So I will continue to go to the gym, reap the benefits, and try to keep my impulse to compete in check.  Be warned that excelling is not something you simply decide to do as a third or fourth passion.  It's best not to compete and expect to win against people whose first priority is fitness when your first and second priorities are something else.",1327934519

And what is described in this article happened.  Anytime we'd make a small refactor, we'd have to go update 3-4 test libraries.  And if it was a big one, then you have a lot of tests to update.  And since some were complex (or since there were a lot of them) people didn't dig into that much.  When people finally did it sometimes showed the test wasn't even testing what it was supposed to anymore.<p>The other issue is we had a lot of bugs around the integration of data.  For instance if the DB class returned back an empty array vs null vs empty string.  When we did the unit test we mocked it to return what we thought it should, which may not be the correct one.  Integration tests better caught this, functional tests even more so.<p>It seems a lot of shops don't use tests at all, now working at places that have done both, I'd rather error on the side of fewer tests, and do it smart instead of hitting a metric and assuming your code falls into line.",1327934247

Is it optimistic or egotistical for every SV engineer to believe that they are capable of creating a company worth a nine-figure IPO or acquisition - or, alternatively, that they can personally increase an established company's bottom line by a million a year?  Somewhere in between, I'd guess.  Partly it's overestimation of the market, partly it's overestimation of the self.  Either way, it does seem to be a difference between SV and elsewhere.  SV entrepreneurs believe they can succeed because it never even occurred to them to believe otherwise and of course nobody else would suggest such a thing.  Entrepreneurs elsewhere are generally more aware of doubts and concerns, but consciously intend to prove the nay-sayers wrong.<p>Is one approach or mindset better than the other?  It's tempting to say that the financial success of SV validates that approach, but I don't think that success occurs in a vacuum.  Could those SV companies get where they are without past contributions from MIT or Bell Labs, current ones from Austin or Seattle?  I don't think so.

Hence, my point about introverts needing or seeking less social stimulus, and extroverts needing and/or seeking more social stimulus.<p>In the case you cite:<p><i>""You can be a very social person and have tons of friends etc etc but at the end of the day if you are not too affected by other's opinions about you then you are an introvert.""</i><p>This is not wholly correct. Introverts can be affected by others' opinions, and indeed, some are <i>very</i> affected. I do agree, however, that it is entirely possible for an introvert to be sociable and to have a lot of friends.

So the article's observation about mixing activities, your observation about short-term memory, and the widespread folklore about avoiding conscious interference with learning could all have the same mechanism.

I'm quite sure that textmate, sublime and emacs are perfectly good editors, but there's no way I could ever switch full time.<p>If you're a touch-typist and you become proficient in vim, the friction between thinking about an edit and it materializing on the screen in front of you is reduced.

Contrast this with move hand to mouse, click where you want to edit, hit backspace, type in new character.<p>IME this is not necessarily faster, just a lot more comfortable once you get used to it.<p>A lot of comments will say 'you can have vi-mode in <other editor>' but I've yet to see an implementation that covers the entirety of normal mode _and_ supports custom remaps, and even then the mappings would need an interface to its plugins before it approaches a vim-like environment.",1327932643

Sports is a 4 letter word in a lot of social circles (academia, tech to a decent extent) and it usually just reeks of pretentiousness. I find myself having to be unusually careful not to bring up sports when talking to anyone in tech I don&#x27;t know well, whereas I rarely have that issue outside of it.<p>Congratulations, you dismissed the entirety of American football as &quot;roid rage violence&quot;. You also have an encyclopedic knowledge of internet memes, so I&#x27;m not sure I really trust your judgement vis a vis what qualifies as a worthwhile endeavor.<p>> Sports aren&#x27;t intellectual<p>> Sports talk is glorified tabloid talk<p>Go to a sabermetrics conference and prepare to be baffled. Nate Silver got his start as a baseball writer.<p>> Sports are overly violent<p>So is GTA 5. Watching sports doesn&#x27;t make a person any more violent than playing video games does. Sports-related violence is semi-frequent and deplorable, but blaming sports for causing drunken boorish behavior is just like blaming Doom for Columbine.<p>Most professional athletes are well aware of what they&#x27;re getting into these days [1], so I don&#x27;t buy arguments about &quot;protecting the athletes&quot; as a reason to ban sports entirely either (augmenting the rules to decrease injury rates, sure, absolutely).<p>> I&#x27;m not going to pretend to like something I don&#x27;t like<p>That&#x27;s fine.

Those are both N^2 terms.  Per capita, it would be an N^1 term.  At the human scale of around 150 personal relationships, everybody knows everybody, so the burden for anyone is knowing everyone else.<p>Beyond that size, you need at least one intermediary.  There are N x (N-1) x (N-2) interactions between two people with an unspecified intermediary.  That is an N^3 term, so N^2 per capita.  The burden there is knowing at least one person that knows the person you want to deal with.  At another critical size, again dependent on human social limits, you can no longer effectively use friend-of-a-friend connections.<p>Then you create sociological systems to take the place of personal intermediaries.  These tend to scale relatively proportionally with the size of the population.  A road system for a town with twice the population will be about twice as big.  Miles of road per person will be similar near the median town size.  The same goes for cops per person and sewer pipes per person and cash available for withdrawal from bank branches per person, and so on.  For simplicity, we can just assume that all the systems of civil society scale according to N.  So now all trades with two counterparties have complexity N x N x (N-1), which is again an N^3 term with an N^2 per-capita component.  But the scale of the system is not <i>necessarily</i> N^1.  We just know it&#x27;s a positive number.  So the per-capita coordination burden is more rightfully N^(1+something).<p>That &quot;something&quot; can be found by performing a statistical analysis of city budgets by city population.

The Baltic states, Poland, everyone except the southern countries (and I assume Spain with a thriving economy in 2014/2015 will join the club when unemployment drops) is on the same page. But as an excellent demagogue Tsipras knows he needs a simple enemy (Germany) to rally the mob.<p>2. Yes Germany defaulted, but did not make it it&#x27;s modus operandi.<p>Excellent that you&#x27;ve brought up the Marshall plan:<p>The Marshall plan was essentially the same as what the EU imposes on Greece: &quot;The Marshall Plan required a lessening of interstate barriers, a dropping of many petty regulations constraining business, and encouraged increase productivity, labour union membership, and the adoption of modern business procedures.&quot; 
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan</a><p>Where it differed: Beside that the Marshall Plan required European countries (beside Germany e.g. France, Britain, essentially everyone else) to buy from US companies: &quot;Much of the Marshall Plan aid would be used by the Europeans to buy manufactured goods and raw materials from the United States and Canada. [...] The Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States&quot; (Same source)<p>Last interesting tidbit from the Marshall plan &quot;The first substantial aid went to Greece and Turkey in January 1947&quot;.
(Same source)<p><i></i>Indeed Greece got nearly twice the money from the Marhsall plan per person compared to Germany.<i></i><p>(For comparision Germany got 1.5B, Greece 0.4B, UK 3.3B, France 2.3B)<p>2. On war damages: I agree they were not paid and I agree with you on moral grounds, but I&#x27;m not sure it is economically relevant. The billions from the EU and the (2015 Euro) Marshall plan did not help, so I would not assume paying war damages would put Greece in a different situation. Except perhaps this makes Germany (see 1) a nice enemy.<p>While we&#x27;re at war damages, I don&#x27;t think Greece has paid war damages for any of the wars it started over the last 2500 years. The invasion of Turkey, the baltic war or going back to the support of Alexander the Great - I wonder if Greece paid war damages to Iran for that. Or to Italy for the occupation and exploitation of Sicily (or the other colonies when Greece was an imperialistic colonial power house). So while I agree that Germany should have paid damages on moral grounds, this is a very slippery slope.<p>3. Tax cheaters always find moral explainations for their behaviour.",1422647323

  #
  # 3. starting with line 2, write normal python or do some of
  #    the ! magic of ipython, so that you can use shell commands
  #    within python and even assign their output to a variable via
  #    var = !cmd1 | cmd2 | cmd3                          # enjoy ;)
  #
  # 4. run via ./scriptname.ipy - if it fails with recognizing % and !
  #    but parses raw python fine, please check again for the .ipy suffix which must be there!
  #
  # ugly example, please go and find more in the wild
  files = !ls *.* | grep &quot;y&quot;

Obviously these will vary depending on the degree to how &quot;start-upy&quot; your company is but I think you can measure it most by the size. In the extreme example, when you start your own company, you own it all. You want casual Fridays? It&#x27;s done. You want a remote/results-only workplace policy? It&#x27;s done. Cubicles, private offices, or wide open desk farms - you pick.<p>From a developer&#x27;s perspective, you don&#x27;t have to support someone else&#x27;s code (at least for now). It&#x27;s YOUR code - but it&#x27;s also YOUR bug when they do come up. It&#x27;s much less stressful fixing your own bugs then a &quot;senior&quot; developer who&#x27;s worked there for 15 years and supposedly knows what he&#x27;s doing but fails to take responsibility.<p>I previously worked at a large ad tech startup (using that term loosely, they had just gone public and had about 250 people) and it drove me nuts. Particularly, it was the strain of having to work for someone I didn&#x27;t respect. I left and now run a company with some friends - all of whom I believe to be smarter than I. There is no better feeling than being the dumbest one in the room. That is a luxury rarely afforded at large companies. Invariably, you&#x27;re going to end up with people at the bottom of the barrel. When you&#x27;re the owner/boss/hiring manager - you get to pick the people you work with.<p>TL;DR: Startups aren&#x27;t about compensation it&#x27;s about the enjoyment of picking the workplace you want to be in. You don&#x27;t have to worry about working with people you dislike, because you pick them all!<p>Edit: Also forgot to mention, I have learned exponentially more in the last 2 years of running my business than I feel like in the rest of my life combined.

I grew up when they were a dynasty in the 90s, and at the time it seemed like going to the Super Bowl is something they were supposed to do every year. I cried after some tough losses.<p>Sometimes I get into other local teams when they are doing well, and I&#x27;ve even tried to be interested in other football teams, but there&#x27;s no team like the Cowboys for me. I can&#x27;t feel the extreme joy nor anger or sadness when watching other teams. The best I can drum up is a &quot;that&#x27;s nice&quot;. It is actually easier watching other teams because I feel like I have much less invested.<p>I didn&#x27;t have to cultivate this interest, there is nothing logical about it. I realize this. Realizing this random illogical love in my life has helped me to look at a lot of things differently, like politics and parties. Ignoring those indirect effects (always realize when you are a homer about something) there is a great advantage if you can reach this level of interest:<p>Once they stopped being dominant in the 90s, the Cowboys for years have been a team that look really good on paper, people pick them to win, and then they disappoint, often times in rage inducing ways. Being slightly younger, naive, and a homer, I&#x27;d always buy in. It didn&#x27;t take until the last few years that I got their gimmick and as a passionate fan am sorry to say I didn&#x27;t watch a number of games last year and/or turned them off at halftime.<p>This year, they were picked buy experts to be very mediocre. The first game seemed to prove this. I turned if off after the 1st quarter as the 49ers were beating the hell out of them. Same old Cowboys. I couldn&#x27;t help but to watch week 2 and a win over the hapless Titans. Then they went down 21-0 in week 3 against the Rams and I turned the TV off. Thankfully, my interest and a friend goaded me into turning the TV back on to watch them come all the way back and win. Week after week for the rest of the year they did this: fell behind and seemed destined for a loss, only to fight back and pull themselves to victory. And I, conditioned as I was to expect failure, continued to turn the TV off at moments, only to turn it back on and catch the comeback.<p>This culminated in their wild card game against Detroit. At one point they went down 14-0. Same old Cowboys. Click. Then somewhere they found fight in them and with the benefit of a very questionable call were driving for a winning touchdown at the end of the game. Now I&#x27;ve seen this before. Flashbacks to January of 2008 when Jerry Jones put championship game tickets in the lockers of his players before they played the Giants, a team they had beaten twice already. But the Giants (who would win the Super Bowl) came to play, and at the end of the game Tony Romo found himself driving his team down for an apparent game winning touchdown. That time it wasn&#x27;t meant to be. He threw and interception which was one of those plays which thus far has defined his legacy.<p>Here he was in the Detroit game in a very similar situation. This time, though, he pulled it off. When he got knocked down as he threw that winning touchdown, the crowed erupted, and face down, he slammed his hands on the ground out of joy. Romo is a passionate guy, but I&#x27;ve never seen him like this. He knows he is running out of time, and he wants to win. As a long-suffering fan, the joy was just as great.<p>The Boys ended up losing in Green Bay the next week, but I&#x27;ve though often about why I care about football so much and if I should. I like to be in control of my life. When you love a sports team, you are at the mercy of ownership, good or bad, players, bad breaks (sometimes literally), referees, etc.  Why put yourself through all that emotion when you can&#x27;t do anything about it?<p>But really, that&#x27;s life. Because as much as we&#x27;d like to think otherwise (especially the folks here which are smart, hard-working, independent, and often successful), there are a lot of things you just don&#x27;t have control over in life. You can&#x27;t control whether a competitor does or doesn&#x27;t come along at the right time, you can&#x27;t control whether a drunk driver blindsides you, you can&#x27;t control who you meet or run into. Sports is like that, and sometimes it is good to take a step back, realize you can&#x27;t control everything, and enjoy the ride. Sometimes you&#x27;ll feel rage or sadness, but in that rare instance when a team, your team, proves everyone wrong, when it rewrites the script, when it does what it isn&#x27;t supposed to do and wins, there isn&#x27;t a feeling like like it. And when you see athletes who have worked their entire lives to get to a point and they finally achieve it, it is a rare feeling of empathy and pride that you can feel for a complete stranger. I saw it with Dirk Nowitzki when he won a title in 2011, and I hope to see it for Tony Romo one day as well.<p>Hell, for people doing startups, or just living, athletes are the perfect sources of inspiration. The pressures they face, the pride, the struggle, the doubt, all is so similar. I&#x27;ve personally never been a Kobe Bryant fan, but last summer I read some articles about his work ethic, determination, and attitude, and I both respected him and it inspired me to better myself.<p>Sports are incredibly valuable learning tools, aside from just the avenues they open up with others. And that really can&#x27;t be overstated. I see too many computer-literate people shutting themselves off from others and culture. If you can&#x27;t or don&#x27;t connect with the majority of the population, what makes you think you can build something which will change the world? Granted, sports is just one of many avenues to connect with others, but it is a massive one, and one with lots of benefits.<p>Finally, if you can&#x27;t just fall in love with a team, there are other things to appreciate about sports. In baseball and basketball, I often get more interested in the process of building teams than watching teams play. There&#x27;s magic in watching good GMs outwit everyone else and put together the right collection of players. There&#x27;s magic in watching people like Billy Beane apply a rigorous methodological approach to try to build something (The Oakland As and Moneyball). If you can&#x27;t love a team for love of sport, love it from that kind of logical angle. Maybe you&#x27;ll end up loving the team for completely illogical reasons.<p>I&#x27;ve said enough, maybe too much. I needed to unload those thoughts somewhere. Hope they help someone.",1422646826

In 1934, USA practically banned sale & possession of machine-guns (a $200 tax (equivalent to $6000 today) on a ~$50 product). In 1986, that became an actual ban (for post-&#x27;86 products). As such, the market incentive to develop modern & sophisticated automatic weapons pretty much ended with the M16 (the USA having by far the largest civilian market for firearms). A few non-USA automatics have been designed since (FN P90 and HK MP7 are of note), built around very lightweight ammunition and high capacity magazines in very compact platforms; these point to what could have been developed & available domestically, but was stifled for want of a market to experiment in.

It included registration, authentication, personalized schedules and calendars, news articles, up-to-the-minute updates, a store, physical pass(ID) verification, and a few dashboards for use by clients of my client. Honestly, it was a lovely experience.<p>Presently, 58% of users of my current client&#x27;s site arrive via mobile and minified React tops 145kb, which takes a lot of time to deliver and unpack. I serve 1000 new users per week who can&#x27;t rely on finding React in their browser cache. This is too much overhead. I am a little obsessed with under-one-second loading and 3 second attention spans. Non-minified React is 642kb and that&#x27;s too much code for me to grok if I want to understand what my application is doing.<p>Then I found Mithril. It&#x27;s faster than anything. It&#x27;s tiny. It does only what it needs to do, no bloat. And it does most of the good stuff that React does. It&#x27;s also FRP friendly, another current obsession of mine.<p>It&#x27;s in the early stages, but it is so small and focused that it can be used anywhere. TODAY. mithril.js is small enough to understand in detail. Beyond the basic documentation is a blog and API docs written as precisely and as focused as the code. It&#x27;s a testament to its quality that the earliest blog entries are applicable today. I recommend reading them from oldest to newest. They read more like a tutorial than a blog. Post a question to the Google Group and Leo will likely refer you back to a blog post because he&#x27;s already covered your question.<p>Another sign that Mithril is of great quality: most public discussion about Mithril revolves around the philosophy and logic of app design, not code errors. When errors are discovered, Leo patches them within hours if not minutes.<p>Leo got so much right. Most things right. More than any other framework I know.",1422645950

Ask about severance, but don&#x27;t get pushy or threatening if not offered it (you don&#x27;t want an extortion rap). Ask about a guaranteed positive reference (by contract, and with LinkedIn recommendations) and <i>do</i> be pushy or threatening if not offered it. Have your references checked in any case by a third party. Don&#x27;t sign non-disparagement for less than 3 months&#x27; severance, although you should almost never disparage an ex-employer. Do sign non-litigation if offered a positive reference and a cash severance you can accept (which may be zero, if you have savings and confidence).<p>Take a week or two to recover, emotionally, but no more. Being unemployed on dwindling savings is no fun, so get yourself in the game immediately before you start getting depressed or moody or whatever. Work so hard that you don&#x27;t have time to get moody. Looking for work <i>is</i> your new job. Job searches have a lot of latency and you can work on your side projects while you wait for emails and calls to get returned (otherwise, you&#x27;ll go fucking nuts refreshing your email client).<p>Describe your situation as a layoff for economic reasons (even if it wasn&#x27;t) and say that your performance reviews were excellent (even if they weren&#x27;t) and don&#x27;t say anything negative about former colleagues, managers, or employers except in a you-or-them situation (such as a 6-month job, where <i>someone</i> will come off looking bad and your job is to make sure that it&#x27;s not you... but even then, minimize what you say.)<p><i>What would you do in my situation (would you stay in a smaller city?)</i><p>Take your job search national. It&#x27;s not about &quot;leaving Cleveland&quot;. A good company will give you at least $5k post-tax for relocation. (Add $4-5k for NYC because rental brokers collect 15% on tenant side.) It&#x27;s about going where the jobs are. Obviously some locales are better than others. Seattle, Boulder, Austin, and Chicago have strong tech markets and (relative to SF or NYC) moderate cost of living. NYC is an option if you don&#x27;t need a lot of space and you&#x27;re willing to downsize on furniture. If you choose NYC, include the broker fee (again, 15% of a year&#x27;s rent) and loss-on-sale for your car (you&#x27;ll be getting rid of it) in your relo calculations. San Francisco... some love it, some hate it, and I doubt I&#x27;d move there without a stellar offer (I&#x27;m 31) but if you find something out there, give it a go.<p><i>if you could start over in web development, what would you focus on?</i><p>Don&#x27;t fret about starting over.

It included registration, authentication, personalized schedules and calendars, news articles, up-to-the-minute updates, a store, physical pass(ID) verification, and a few dashboards for use by clients of my client. Honestly, it was a lovely experience. Once in the React rhythm, the coding became an exercise in pattern application. This was before Flux came along.<p>Presently, 58% of users of my current client&#x27;s site arrive via mobile and minified React tops 145kb, which takes a lot of time to deliver and unpack. I serve 1000 new users per week who can&#x27;t rely on finding React in their browser cache. This is too much overhead. I am a little obsessed with under-one-second loading and 3 second attention spans. Non-minified React is 642kb and that&#x27;s too much code for me to grok if I want to understand what my application is doing. I did some work converting Bootstrap to React and ramping up took too much of my time.<p>Then I found Mithril. It&#x27;s faster than anything. It&#x27;s tiny. It does only what it needs to do, no bloat. And it does most of the good stuff that React does. It&#x27;s also FRP friendly, another current obsession of mine.<p>It&#x27;s in the early stages, but it is so small and focused that it can be used anywhere. TODAY. Consider it code you would have written on your own if you&#x27;d had the time (and were a VERY talented js coder). mithril.js is small enough to understand in detail. It&#x27;s so well designed that even an intermediate dev like me can grasp it. Beyond the basic documentation is a blog and API docs written as precisely and as focused as the code. The API is so small you can master it in an hour or two. It&#x27;s a testament to its quality that the earliest blog entries are applicable today. I recommend reading them from oldest to newest. They read more like a tutorial than a blog. Post a question to the Google Group and Leo will likely refer you back to a blog post because he&#x27;s already covered your question.<p>Another sign that Mithril is of great quality: most public discussion about Mithril revolves around the philosophy and logic of app design, not code errors. When errors are discovered, Leo patches them within hours if not minutes.<p>Leo got so much right. Most things right. More than any other framework I know.",1422644923

You can make a coordinate change that makes this singularity go away,  but then you get the classical black hole singularity where there is either an &quot;end of time&quot; or an infinitely dense point or ring.<p>Physicists believed that this coordinate transformation was valid but it is not because it infinitely stretches space/time which at some point will blow up the Planck scale to be visible,  at which point something completely indescribable happens -- it might be something like DSR or it might be different,  but you void any warranty on the space time continuation,  so the classical black hole is science fiction.<p>The obvious semiclasicalization is for the infinitely dense singularity to become a highly dense object which has some dimensions on the length of the Planck scale,  but no model of quantum black hole using actual quantum gravity looks like that at all.<p>We don&#x27;t have a &quot;complete&quot; theory of quantum gravity but we do have a number of competing partial theories,  and we can already make some strong conclusions,  such as holography,  that are generic to many or any QG models.

The ultimate archery trick. Proving that Hollywood archery is not historical.<p>Press release:
<a href=""http://clausraasted.dk/larsandersen/n.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://clausraasted.dk/larsandersen/n..</a>.<p>Podcast about how I started archery:
<a href=""https://soundcloud.com/claus-raasted/.."" rel=""nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/claus-raasted/..</a>.<p>DO I HIT EVERYHING?
I use a LOT of time practicing, and every time I set out to learn a new skill, a new trick or how to handle a new type of bow or arrow, it takes a long time, with plenty of misses. When I got the idea of grabbing an arrow in flight and firing before I landed, it took me months to learn. For a long time, arrows flew everywhere!<p>But there&#x27;s no trick in the video that I haven&#x27;t done many times (except for splitting the arrow in flight – after I&#x27;d done that once I finished the video). The one with hitting the blade I&#x27;ve only done three times, though. All that running hurt my knees. ;-)<p>ON MY BOWS AND POWER
Many people talk about how what I do is only possible because I use bows that are less powerful than English longbows. They are correct. I&#x27;m 50 years old, and have been doing archery for only ten years. I&#x27;ll never be able to shoot really fast with 100 lbs+ war bows. I tried, but it just produced injuries. Had I started at age 10, it would have been a different story. ;-)<p>There is also a tendency from critics to assume that bows were always fired against plate armour (as at Crecy in 1346 and Agincourt in 1415). This was very much the exception. Many opponents had little or no armour at all, and Stone Age findings show that many animals were taken down by multiple shots. Also, in 1923 Saxton T Pope examined a number of historical museum bows from around the world. His conclusion was that most only had a tensile strength of 45-50 pounds.<p>THE CHAINMAIL TEST
Around 04:22 I penetrate chainmail. The arrows had bodkin tips, and the chainmail is riveted. However, while the gambeson is thick, it&#x27;s not as thick as some I&#x27;ve seen elsewhere. But one reason the arrows penetrate is that I sharpen not only the tip itself, but also the edges of the bodkin tip.<p>SHOOTING ON THE RIGHT SIDE
There are archery traditions alive today which shoot the arrow on the right side of the bow, as I do. However, the places where most people come into contact with archery (Hollywood, The Olympics, archery clubs) do it left around the bow.<p>THE BACK QUIVER
Is it a myth? Yes and no. Some archers definitely slung their quivers on their backs for when they were marching, just like soldiers did with shields. We also can&#x27;t rule out that some archers – who didn&#x27;t care what arrow they picked from the quiver or who didn&#x27;t need to move rapidly – had quivers on their backs, but we can rule out that this was a general thing as Hollywood makes it out to be.<p>THE THREE LEVELS OF ARROW HANDLING
The first level of arrow handling is having the arrows in a quiver, and drawing them one at a time. It&#x27;s easy, and it&#x27;s intuitive. Progressing from there to holding arrows in the bow hand takes practice, but it can be learned.<p>There are some drawbacks, however. Arab Archery (the book) says that it&#x27;s less useful, because the arrows vibrate when shooting with powerful bows, causing imprecise shots.<p>The third level, keeping the arrows in the draw hand, provides a several benefits, but it requires that one is able to draw and shoot in one single movement without thinking. And that takes a LOT of practice. ;-)<p>THE ULTIMATE TRICK TOOK 14 TAKES<p>At first, I didn&#x27;t think it was possible. You don&#x27;t have time to aim or think, but can only do it if your reactions are completely instinctive. First of all, you need to be convinced that you WILL hit it, so you can “feel” the incoming arrow and fire at it instead of just flinching away.<p>I was also in doubt whether it was smart to show this, because I don&#x27;t want anyone to get hurt trying to copy the trick. I trained for years with soft boffer arrows and spent a LONG time before I tried it even the first time. And the arrow fired at me was not fired with a very powerful bow, though it was definitely dangerous enough!<p>It was a light bamboo arrow with a metal tip, and the arrow I shot back was a heavier aluminum arrow. That the arrow split was just pure luck, and I&#x27;m not certain I could repeat it without first training for a long time. I believe it split because it hit just behind the head and made the shafts fluctuate against each other, causing the bamboo shaft to split lengthwise.<p>I hope to try it again using a proper high-speed camera!<p>FINAL WORDS

The electric power to resistance heaters is input in a &quot;proprietary waveform&quot;, and is measured with a wattmeter.<p>This is a typical thing with &quot;free energy&quot; scams. The same thing was tried back in the &quot;piezos&quot; era, when putting resonant piezoelectric devices in an oscillating tank circuit was supposed to produce more power than went in. (But it did not, of course, run self-sustaining, without outside power).<p>Measuring wattage of unusual waveforms is hard.  W = E*I, or watts equals current times voltage, but you have to integrate the instantaneous product over time.  Many wattmeters don&#x27;t do a full integration; they&#x27;re mostly for sine waves, and may have frequency limitations. The E-Cat guy won&#x27;t let observers use a scope to see that &quot;proprietary waveform&quot;.

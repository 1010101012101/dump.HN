8185955,comment,8185461,8185867,2,0,specialp,,,"Yes this is true which is even more risky for the fate of a standardized web.  Right now and in the past it was very important for Google to do this for 2 reasons: 1. They get to be the default search for a huge amount of people, and 2: They support someone who was making a competing product against another company doing lock-in for their own benefit (Microsoft).<p>However, what if one day Google Chrome has 70%+ market share? Then the Chrome only creep will continue.  You can already tell that they are doing a lot of Chrome only things on their web properties as with the nightly chrome builds you get occasional Google property only weird bugs. If Chrome had a massive market share they can then not have to bother supporting Mozilla or web standards. They can then leverage Chrome to have an advantage in performance and even monetization of Google products over others.<p>You can say right now Google has not done this, but they are doing small things here and there that are going down that route. Altruism is not a trait companies are known to keep for long, especially when there is no competition.",1408189890

That lead me to the conclusion that Titan was just too complex because from my perspective it&#x27;s obvious that you guys are spreading yourselves too thin with the 7 different backends.<p>Why do you need both a BerkeleyDB and PersistIt backend? At the absolute most you should have 2 or 3. Single Machine, AP Cluster, ACID Cluster.<p>7 backends means 7 different database products, with the same API facade. Duh right? Well the problem is that constrains your API to a least common denominator feature set, limiting access to the unique attributes and capabilites of the underlying backend. Not to mention completely abstracting away memory/disk issues. This is a really big issue with your approach. You have some sunken costs here but I think eventually you will see the value in tightening up your focus.",1408189862

Any such system is almost certainly going to be card-based, not check-based. There&#x27;s no reason why 1/365th of the annual amount couldn&#x27;t be deposited to the card every day, rather than dropping in a big slug of cash once a month. Transaction costs would be slightly higher, but not by much (the government should be able to negotiate really, really good rates for transactions, and they&#x27;re already getting pretty cheap).<p>Yeah, there are still going to be some people who go out and buy beer every morning.

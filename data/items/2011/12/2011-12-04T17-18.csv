3311218,comment,3310873,3310873,3,0,dctoedt,,,"Defense costs for a seastead would be ruinous. A seastead is just another form of island. An island that's close to a land power will almost certainly need the deterrent effect of a strong navy --- its own or that of a friendly power --- if it wants to retain its independence. Strong navies are really, really expensive to build and maintain; a seastead probably would not be able to do either.<p><i>Example:</i>  Had it not been for the presence of the U.S. Seventh Fleet, mainland China probably would have invaded and conquered Taiwan in 1949 or 1950, or on any of a number of ""crisis"" occasions since then. It's no accident that whenever China rattles its saber about Taiwan, one or more U.S. aircraft carrier task forces moves into the Taiwan Strait.<p><i>Example:</i> Had it not been for the presence of the Royal Navy, the Germans probably would have invaded and conquered England in 1940. The same is true of Napoleon in 1803, for that matter.<p>Economically, a seastead probably couldn't maintain the kind of navy needed for this task. England was able to maintain the Royal Navy in the 17th through 19th centuries, but it could draw on the resources of a growing empire. Today's Britannia doesn't come close to ruling the waves; it can't afford to.<p>Could a seastead get a strong, friendly power to extend its own navy's umbrella of protection, the way the U.S. has done with Taiwan? Possibly, but the friendly power would have to perceive a benefit to itself before it'd be willing to do so.",1323021550

When we had something to show, they'd give us feedback based on how well it met the customers' needs, and they'd use their relationships with customers to get some customers to give us feedback on intermediate results. They did research. If they didn't know something, they'd say so, and find out.<p>They trusted us to give them fair estimates. If something was going to take so long it would miss a market opportunity, they'd work with us to figure out alternatives.<p>They'd prioritize, and stick to these priorities unless significant new information came along, in which case they'd sit with us to make tradeoffs.<p>What did the rest of them do?<p>They'd specify requirements in terms of implementation. They'd tell us how they wanted something architected. They'd attempt to design a UI and tell us the requirement was to implement that UI. They'd trust their gut without doing actual research.

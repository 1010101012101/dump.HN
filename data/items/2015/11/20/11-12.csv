Right now you have no real arguments. And you know you won&#x27;t have, since I&#x27;ll recognize if you try to give something out of the context, that&#x27;s why you don&#x27;t even try.<p>What is your background in claiming what you claim? What do you actually know about Islam and Muslims, personally? Who tortured your ancestors? Or whom your ancestors tortured? You must have ancestors and they must have been involved in something. I&#x27;ve given you my background. Do you know anybody who&#x27;s not Muslim but who&#x27;s parents and grandparents lived in the Muslim country? Try to talk to such people.<p>> There is no inherent danger from Islam.<p>Yes there is, whoever isn&#x27;t a Muslim and reads Quran immediately understands. It&#x27;s totally not comparable to the texts of any other religion, that&#x27;s why we see what we see now every day.

Yet, that a camel trader sparks uproar in his tribe, that he wants to make his fellow citizens believe that he talked to the archangel Gabriel; that he boasted about being taken up into heaven and receiving a part of that indigestible book there, which can shake common sense on every page, that to gain respect for this work, he covers his country with fire and iron, that he strangles fathers, drags away daughters, that he leaves the beaten a free choice between death and his faith: now this is certainly something that no-one can excuse, unless he came as a Turk into the world, unless superstition has stifled any natural light of reason in him.&quot;<p>Voltaire (1694-1788)",1448020326

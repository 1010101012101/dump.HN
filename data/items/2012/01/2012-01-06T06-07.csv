3432336,comment,3428567,3429078,1,0,b1daly,,,"Given that most people need a job to pay the bills, it seems that ""I need the money"" has to be one of the most truthful answers in a job interview (or ""I want more money""). That's why it's a job and not just a fun thing to do. A lot of talented people probably wouldn't have a job if they didn't need it, but since they do they curtail their own desires to fit the needs of an employer in exchange for money. A lot of really great work gets done this way, but somehow it seems bad to say it.",1325832943

3432329,comment,3431132,3432293,3,0,jackowayed,,,"Heroku runs a process for each application (or multiple). The first one for an application is free. But just like with GAE, they'll spin it down if it's idle long enough. So I know that if I go to a site of mine that no one has visited in months, where I'm not paying for extra instances, it'll take a few seconds to load. But having to run those free instances doesn't kill them because all but the first one for an application is paid for at 5 cents/hour, which presumable is enough margin to cover the free instances, and then some.<p>But they run normal applications. It started out being any Rack (Ruby web standard--Rails, Sinatra, etc) app; they've expanded into other languages now, but it's always some open framework that they're running for you, not something they own and keep proprietary. They give you a normal Postgres database. There are a few restrictions that you might not have on your own hosting (like a read-only filesystem). But you could basically take an app running on Heroku, install a webserver and Rails, install Postgres, make sure any config you had was the same, and run it.<p>Another huge advantage Heroku has is the ability to give other people access to their datacenters, since they're just running on EC2. So there's lots of Addon services that can add various pieces of functionality, like hosting a different database, many of which are only tractable because they're also hosted on EC2 and thus have very good latency to Heroku servers.<p>This means that you're not stuck with Postgres. If you think a part of your data, or all of your data, would be better stored in Mongo or Couch or Redis or flat files on S3, there are hosted services for that, and you can even deploy your own solution on EC2 if you'd rather. This leads to nice halfway solutions where you use Heroku to have super-scalable application servers, and maybe to manage your main relational db, but then you can tack on other things where that doesn't fit with your problem. Now, if you're running some of your own EC2 instances, you're losing some of the ""never have to worry about hosting again"" value of Heroku, but at least it's possible. It could be a temporary solution that keeps you above water while you migrate off of Heroku, or maybe you decide it really is the best long-term solution.",1325832749

3432325,comment,3431132,3432129,1,0,IgorPartola,,,"Thanks for the explanation. The reason for the comparison is two-fold. First, there seems to be a section of GAE users who use it solely to host a blog, a need satisfied by a much cheaper service elsewhere.<p>Second, while I understand the value of high availability and not having to worry about Ops, I am talking about cost per HTTP request. Here, the $2 PHP host is a clear winner. As I said, that does not mean it is better. Your analogy with the oil tanker and a row boat is applicable: one is more appropriate if you just want to cross the pond.

Congrats on succeeding with the idea.  Since there's not much value left in keeping an already-executed idea to myself:<p><pre><code>  May 13, 2008

  I want to make a piano music stand that integrates a 19"" or 24""
  widescreen LCD with built-in sheet music display software.  This
  would allow a pianist to access a large library of music without
  having to store it all or risk damage to fragile printed music.
  This display could also be linked to a MIDI or other playback
  and recording system to evaluate the correctness of a
  performance, quickly transform a performance into printed music,
  or control the parameters of a synthesized piano.  The stand
  would be designed to accommodate printed music in front of the
  LCD display.  A reflective display from Pixel Qi would be the
  coolest, with more of a paper look.  It would be really cool to
  work with Bosendorfer to have the system integrated into their
  player pianos.

  The display could serve as a useful educational tool by grading
  performance as mentioned previously, by masking out parts of a
  piece to aid memorization, and by presenting
  video/animated/automated lessons to a student.  It could also
  include teleconferencing software/hardware to allow remote
  education.  If the piano includes a clutch to detach the keys
  from the hammers, it might be able to be used as a software
  synthesizer.

  The system could also be used to provide prerecorded or
  automatically generated accompaniment for a solo pianist.

3432285,comment,3431037,3431625,1,0,Natsu,,,"> It is not true, however, that the continued enforcement of copyright laws in a hyper-connected world depends on having SOPA-style laws in effect.<p>This statement is true in that one can certainly continue to enforce copyright precisely as we do now, or to craft new measures that attempt to address the problem without creating so many new problems.  The problem comes from the fact that none of these measures are likely to solve the problem from the studio's point of view.<p>As one might expect, they will continue to push for stronger laws as long as piracy remains rampant.  And piracy will remain rampant so long as there are even a few people capable of piracy:  thanks to computers, one unrestricted copy is enough for everyone in the entire world.  Short of, say, outlawing computers, that isn't changing any time soon.  There simply isn't anyone out there who can bear the weight of enforcing these laws at a level that would substantially reduce piracy, so it should come as no wonder that the studios have long sought to put that burden on someone else's shoulders.  I simply do not see a technical solution to this as such.  Piracy existed before the internet, after all, and there are no firewalls, filters or DRM on sneakernet.  Without a technical solution, the law loses force.  It's about like putting up a bigger ""KEEP OUT"" sign because we have no fence to put up.<p>That's not to say the artists are just screwed, though.  I mean, iTunes still does a ton of business, even though you could get everything for free.  So there are ways to survive in spite of rampant piracy.  There are also ways to improve copyright law itself.  William Patry's _How to Fix Copyright_ has some interesting ideas on that subject.  But in the end, that means that the solution comes from redefining the problem:  rather than ending piracy, one must find ways to succeed in spite of it.  That may not be fair to them, but I certainly believe it's necessary.",1325831652

3432231,comment,3431107,3431107,6,0,nessus42,,,"I'm with the camp that thinks that having to code on a whiteboard for an interview is just <i>INANE</i>. Worse than that, I find it to be borderline abusive. The whole concept just makes me quite mad. I graduated from MIT, and in my first programming class there (SICP), which I took first semester freshman year, I scored in the top 10 students out of 200 in the class. I've written software to control a space telescope and adapted brain imaging software to visualize astronomical data. I wrote a tutorial on how to do coordinate frame transformations, after first deriving the math myself (which isn't rocket science, but I hadn't done any linear algebra in 20 years at the time, so it took some thought).<p>Clearly I know how to code! But put me at a whiteboard and ask me to code Hello World, and I'm likely to start sweating profusely and then get very dizzy, and then just ask to leave. I managed to make it through a first round of interviews at Google, but I had to take tranquilizers before the interview to make sure that the aforementioned scenario would not happen, but I don't think that people should have to be subjected to this. And I certainly wouldn't subject myself to this for almost any other company. I'd just say, ""Screw you--I can find a job elsewhere."" (I didn't end up doing the second round of Google interviews because I was offered a job elsewhere, and Google said that it would take a least an additional month to make a hiring decision.)<p>Where I work now, the interviewing process is much more civilized. We send the specs for a small program along with some unit tests, and give the applicant however long they'd like to complete it. It should take a page or two of code and a couple of hours to complete at most. One might worry that people would cheat, but that hasn't been my experience. Most applicants never submit a solution at all. I suspect this is because they couldn't get their solution to pass the unit tests. (What we ask them to do, is not difficult. Anyone who passed a college course in software engineering with a grade better than a C should have absolutely no problem completing the assignment.)<p>So, then some fraction of applicants actually complete the assignment. These submissions show that the vast majority of so-called software engineers -- or at least those who are looking for jobs -- can't code their way out of a paper bag. I.e., most of the submissions are grossly inefficient and hugely over-engineered or under-engineered. Finally, a few of the submissions are passable (rarely do we get a truly excellent solution, which is kind of sad), so we have them come in, and as part of the interview, we'll have them go over their code a bit and explain why they made certain design decisions, etc.<p>If you ask me, this process gives us a much better idea of how someone would perform in the real world of being a software engineer and any amount of coding on a whiteboard ever could.",1325830475

You'd likely be able to easily offer an improved version that iteratively updated a (properly sized) row in-place, [1,0,0,...,0] -> [1,1,0,...,0] -> [1,2,1,...,0], etc., until the last digit became 1, in which case you're done.<p>Then you'd have a conversation about the time and space complexity of that method, you'd hopefully be able to figure out that it's O(N^2) in time and O(N) in space, and the interviewer would ask you whether you could do better. You'd tell him that it's optimal re: space, but that there could possibly be an implementation in O(N) time, and then you'd think for a moment.<p>From there, the interviewer would give you a gentle prod (after all, this isn't a math interview and we don't have all day) by suggesting you look at the ratio between neighboring elements, and then it's easy to, say, look at the eighth row and see that the ratios are 8/1, 7/2, 6/3, 5/4, 4/5, 3/6, 2/7, 1/8 and figure out dspeyer's formula from there.<p>The nice thing about interviews in this format are that they don't require any specific prior knowledge; in fact, they work much better when the candidate has never seen the problem before, because you actually get to talk through it with them for the first time.<p>I realize that algorithms aren't everything, but at a place like Google, at least, they're a lot more important than at a typical Java-shop, so I think questions like this are perfectly fair. If someone can't make it through an interview like that, they're going to have a lot more trouble on the job when they need to cast a complicated machine learning algorithm that's just been invented by the guy down the hall into map-reduce form and get it running well enough so that it can run in real time and actually be tested...",1325830262

So it was fairly painless for them to decide to solve the problem in a way that didn't fit with what Engine Yard would offer them and migrate to their own hardware.

Not that anything can really be done; there are one or two drugs that have a very minimal (but statistically measurable) benefit, but they are very expensive and while they may slightly extend your life (we are talking perhaps a month or two on average) they don't improve your function.<p>After her diagnosis she attended a few support group meetings, and it was striking at how the disease progressed differently in different people.

Maybe it's low self-esteem, but I found it hard to believe how much they valued my skillset (I'm one of those ""designgeneers"").<p>This article helped to explain this: they've been feeding me work to keep me available, even if they don't really need it.

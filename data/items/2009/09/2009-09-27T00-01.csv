This link may be of interest: <a href=""http://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/who-killed-california"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nationalaffairs.com/publications/detail/who-killed-ca...</a><p>I do think the question, given California's fiscal difficulties, of whether or not California will be able to sustain its historical economic advantage is a legitimate one especially with migrations to neighboring states that Texas seems to be benefiting from in particular.  In this particular case however, it would be interesting to know whether or not the cost/burden of regulation has gotten progressively worse or if there's even a trend in California as clearly California has been a success until more recently.<p>There also appears to be a meme developing that Silicon Valley may not hold as many advantages as it did in the past given that the cost to develop a web based business has dropped so dramatically - meaning that access to venture capitalists isn't as important as it used to be.

So I feel qualified to vehemently disagree with myself. ;)<p>On second thought, the problem with the quintile idea is that it presumes that every thread has an equal distribution of valuable contributions, middling contributions, and lousy contributions. But we don't want to rule out (e.g.) the possibility that an entire thread might be great and that every post deserves a dot.<p>Moreover, the quintile idea retains aspects of the piling-on problem: A sufficient quantity of super-upvoted comments will push other worthy comments out of the top quintiles.<p>Finally, quintiles are just way too complicated.<p>So I'm prepared to believe that I was wrong twelve hours ago.

846323,story,,,2,3,jrwoodruff,"Ask HN: Critique my idea for the future of music",,"This idea has a long history with me, and has been one of those ideas that will not go away, but has not been done (at least that I've seen) since I started mulling this four years ago.<p>The overall idea is on par with a paradigm shift, in my opinion, but I'll try and succinctly summarize it in this space.<p>My theory is that music is inherently, in the beginning, local in nature. No band makes it national or international without first cutting their chops at the local bar and moving up to recognition at a state or regional level. My theory is also that many bands are happy to continue performing at local and regional levels, for personal, family or other reasons.<p>So the concept is a Network (for lack of a better term) that reinforces this natural, expanding sphere of influence. A site where local musicians are able to upload and sell their music and merchandise, promote concerts, and communicate with fans, etc.<p>Yea, I know MySpace. But, do you search for, listen to or download music from MySpace? Unless a band tells me to visit their MySpace page, I never bother to look at the site. In general, I try to avoid the site. It suffers from (among other things) the same issues that cripple sites that allow unmoderated commenting. You end up with lots of garbage and no way to locate quality material.<p>To avoid this, the Network would implement a rating system to sort the good from the bad. For simplicity's sake, we'll say it's based on fan votes and number of songs downloaded. But, instead of applying these ratings at a worldwide level, forcing the local garage band to compete with T-Pain, scale it down so that the best (or, more accurately, most popular) bands for a certain <i>geographic area</i> rise to the top of a local site.<p>Once the network gains traction in multiple areas, you can compare the top bands of each local site and create state, regional and national rankings as well. This creates tiers of musical groups. Once a band is popular enough to make it into a state or regional ranking, they may not appear on the local chart, allowing new acts to rise to the top of the local rankings.<p>This would occur as the band works to increase its fan-base by playing in a larger area. For instance, a band that plays Grand Rapids regularly may decide they're serious, so they kick off a regional tour and play multiple shows in Chicago, Detroit, and multiple smaller towns along the way, hopefully picking up more fans and selling more songs.<p>There's much, much more to this idea, including monetization ideas, but I'll stop here. I'm sure there are massive holes, but I hope I've managed to paint a broad, general picture of the conept.<p>I posted this here today because I don't know what else to do with it. The original concept came to me in 2005. In 2006, on a whim, I submitted it to the company I work for as part of a new company 'innovation' innitiative. It was selected for further development, I was flown to HQ, got to meet the execs, shake hands, take photos, sit in a windowless conference room for three days of 'blue-sky' conceptualizing, then was flown home. And for all intents and purposes, it disappeared into the ether of empty corporate hype.<p>It was a very disappointing experience and I've tried to just block it out of my head, but it's an idea I'm very fond of, but know that I don't have the skills or contacts to execute. However, it is a project I would very much like to be involved in.<p>Ok, so unleash the dogs and tear it apart. Tell me that it's been tried and failed, it can't be done, it's a fatally flawed concept, or it needs to be done (and where to start).<p>Thanks.",1254012261

You're proposing to do a custom query, of <i>arbitrary, user-chosen complexity</i>, for every single page view.<p>Moreover, the result will be of dubious merit. Individualized filter functions screw up conversation. That's what's wrong with conversation on the rest of the web -- people all read blogs, but nobody reads the same blogs, and people encounter the blogs in arbitrary order, and some blog entries are more out of date than others, and the result is like trying to carry on a conversation with a bright but slightly deaf time traveler who is probably a troll.<p>We have a distributed, personalized version of HN comments: They're called blogs and RSS feeds.

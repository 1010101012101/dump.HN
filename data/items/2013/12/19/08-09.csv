If that&#x27;s an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot;, what does that make OS X?<p>Windows Phone has overtaken iOS in Latin America and holds the number two spot for mobile devices. Windows Phone has also overtaken iOS in Italy, and is less than a percentage point away from taking over in Germany as well. Across Europe Windows Phone market share has doubled from this time last year, while iOS continues to decline. Windows Phone is the fastest growing mobile OS worldwide. Nokia&#x27;s customer satisfaction has surpassed all Android manufacturers and is right on the heels of Apple. None of this evidence supports your claim that Windows Phone is &quot;absolutely ignored&quot;.<p>Bing handles roughly 30% (Bing + Yahoo) of internet search traffic in the US. A far cry from being &quot;largely ignored&quot;.<p>None of this paints a picture of &quot;an experience that no one cares about&quot;. Your statements show clear bias with no evidence to support it.

Different developers (all experienced unixians) have different ideas on when stderr should be used instead of stdout. For example should stderr be used for --help, --version or when invalid arguments are passed to a program?<p>Then there&#x27;s the problem with granularity. An output for a long running program could be purely informative, minor warning, major warning, minor error, critical error or some other category.

SF is the center of action in Silicon Valley, even though it is technically not in the actual geographic valley. Other hotbeds of startup activity would include the Palo Alto, Mountain View, and Menlo Park area. As it stands, Santa Clara is quite far from the epicenter of Silicon Valley. Along those lines, 90% of meetups in Silicon Valley happen in SF. Another 10% occur in Mountain View / Palo Alto / Menlo Park.<p>Yes, the big tech companies are in Mtn View / PA / Menlo, but most meetups are in SF because of the sheer density of engineers.<p>There are events happening quite frequently. Check out meetup.com and Eventbrite to stay up to date. <i>You</i> also have to go up to people and take the initiative to talk to them: most meetups have a format where there&#x27;s a speaker and then after the meetup ends people socialize. Lots of people at meetups are looking to hire; a typical conversation would be something like you introducing yourself, asking what the other person does, and then telling them that you&#x27;re looking for an internship. Many times I&#x27;ve had conversations with people and then <i>they</i> will mention that they&#x27;re looking to hire.<p>I&#x27;ve never had luck with craigslist or indeed. Some great resources for finding internships: AngelList (the talent portion of the site) and LinkedIn.<p>Also, nothing wrong with directly applying to companies through their websites. A lot of startups also like it when you take the initiative to email them - a short intro about why you&#x27;re ideal (I&#x27;m Eric and I&#x27;m really interested in <foo>, having done <bar>, bla bla bla).<p>You also need a GitHub account and should put some code there.<p>This is totally unrelated to your job search, but ericna.com is available. You should buy that domain name and someday put a portfolio up there.<p>Also, I&#x27;ve heard of SUNY Buffalo and I wouldn&#x27;t say that its reputation in the US is that of a mediocre university. I would say it&#x27;s a &quot;decent&quot; state university. Have you tried contacting SUNY Buffalo alumni on LinkedIn that work at startups?<p>Also, I&#x27;m a bit confused as to what kind of role you&#x27;re looking for. You experience with Java/C++ leads me to slot you into a systems developer position. Those positions can often be difficult to get. Android is definitely an in-demand skill and I think it would improve your chances of a job if you had an actual app on the Play store.",1387442843

I think it&#x27;s extremely reasonable to regulate that things are safe by default - in fact, that is a core functionality of government. If you really want a tap that will output water hot enough to give 3rd degree burns in one second, I am sure that is possible, the point is that by default it does not.<p>As for competitiveness, I&#x27;m not sure how having more burns victims being paid for by medicare is great for the economy, nor do I see how it&#x27;s efficient for every homebuilder to be forced to go and become an expert on burns so they know exactly what delivery temperature their taps should be set to. It&#x27;s far more efficient to have a central expert organisation do this research, then declare it the standard.<p>I don&#x27;t agree with it all the time, of course.

Just last year freelancer bought vworker.<p>I really hope oDesk - Elance won&#x27;t go the same way freelancer - vworker went.<p>I used to have an account of RentACode, a long time ago. It was mostly a good experience, considering the state of freelancing back then. When my significant otter got fired, I dug the account and handed it over to her -- it had a bunch of good reviews and some of them were for tech writing jobs, so I though it would be useful to her (she&#x27;s not a programmer, she does marketing).<p>RAC had, in the meantime, become freelancer.com. The first thing it did was chew through the money I still had in my account -- two or three hundred dollars the withdrawal of which I had procrastinated for a long time, keeping them there in case I&#x27;d suddenly decide to take new jobs on RAC (then vWorker) again. I didn&#x27;t get anything other than automated answers from their tech support, and eventually settled for that being dead money.<p>Now freelancer.com is a scammer&#x27;s heaven. It doesn&#x27;t have escrows by default, the rounding of of fees is done quite liberally, there seems to be no mechanism to stop automatic bidding (with ridiculous sums that do nothing but bring the average bid price down, since it&#x27;s obvious that whatever is behind those posts is never awarded a project), and their support for disputes is unhelpful at best.<p>My gf is actually still unemployed and still gets projects on Freelancer every once in a while, but after being scammed twice -- with copious help through lack of reaction by Freelancer -- both her and her clients generally eschew its payment system altogether. She usually insists on a 100% milestone on Freelancer.com the first time she works with them, and then it&#x27;s PayPal all the way.<p>The eschewing of the payment system seems to be quite generalized, because their lack of reaction and real buyer <i>and</i> seller protection basically means people end up paying fees for something that is then little more than a glorified job advertising website, since it otherwise fails to offer anything for the (hefty) fees they take.<p>Freelancer.com is a pretty sore sight nowadays. I browse its range of contract offers every once in a while; there&#x27;s generally nothing for me (I do systems programming and embedded stuff -- people don&#x27;t usually hire freelancers to write operating systems or make gadgets, unsurprisingly), but most of the projects <i>and</i> most of the bids depress me. Ads along the lines of &quot;looking for an app expert&quot;, looking for reasonably non-trivial applications that work on a gazillion of platforms, awarded to poor people for sums that seem small even to me.",1387441069

Many systems will write to stdout buffered, but stderr unbuffered, so that writes are visible when the program crashes. Redirecting streams at the shell level doesn&#x27;t stop application level buffering ruining your day.<p>Having said that, GP&#x27;s request is pretty niche, it&#x27;s only useful when the program uses stdout (not a gui, web etc) and is doing work that might write to stderr while it&#x27;s writing to stdout (so no summary report generators, long running physics simulations etc)",1387440619

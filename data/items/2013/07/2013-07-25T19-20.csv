There are of course other ways to do that, I just picked a simple one.  You can break at lines / statements in files, so you don&#x27;t need to include that &quot;debugger&quot; line.  You can do something other than Object.module_eval.  You can use something like Pry that would make this simpler and give you in-line source code, even after editing (IIRC).  You can use something like Hijack to modify any running Ruby process - when you disconnect, your modified code will still be running.<p>Lisp <i>is not special</i> in what it is capable of.  Period.  It&#x27;s special because a) it&#x27;s very old, and b) it&#x27;s <i>tuned</i> for these features, in its own unique, minimalistic way.<p>Yes, not all languages can do this (though you can do crazy things with GDB / debuggers in general, including using it as a REPL for compiled languages (really!  it&#x27;s not hard!)).

Let me think about it a bit, and I&#x27;ll try to post a five sentence postulate.<p>As concerns nature, my observation is that (if I can personify nature, and grant it intention for the argument), it does not mind eliminating large groups of children if some (at least one, I guess) viable children remain. As a matter of fact, eliminating a lot of less viable children in favor of few more viable children is kind of the rule for selection.<p>So we take a group of strongly viable lines, contaminate them, and (in nature&#x27;s much longer perspective) make them less viable. Marked for elimination.<p>We usually think this elimination comes from direct competition, and I would agree that in our experience so far this is the observed case. But what is observable in much GM research is that after three or so generations, animals consuming the GM product stop reproducing.

We created a false memory in mice by optogenetically manipulating memory engrambearing cells in the hippocampus. Dentate gyrus (DG) or CA1 neurons activated by exposure to a particular context were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2. These neurons were later optically reactivated during fear conditioning in a different context. The DG experimental group showed increased freezing in the original context, in which a foot shock was never delivered. The recall of this false memory was context-specific, activated similar downstream regions engaged during natural fear memory recall, and was also capable of driving an active fear response. Our data demonstrate that it is possible to generate an internally represented and behaviorally expressed fear memory via artificial means.

Welcome BigCouch<p>Good news! Cloudant has announced the completion of the BigCouch merge. This is a huge step forward for CouchDB. So thank you to Cloudant, and thank you to the committers (particularly Robert Newson and Paul Davis) who slogged (and travelled the world to pair with each other) to make this happen.<p>What does this mean? Well, right now, the code is merged, but not released. So hold your clicks just a moment! Once the code has been tested, we will include it in one of our regular releases. (If you want to help us test, hop on to the dev@ mailing list!)<p>Whats new? The key accomplishment of the merged code is that BigCouchs clustering capability, along with the rest of Cloudants other enhancements to CouchDBs code base, will now be available in Apache CouchDB. This also includes improvements in compaction and replication speed, as well as boosts for high-concurrency access performance.<p>Painless replication has always been CouchDB&#x27;s biggest feature. Now we get to take advantage of Cloudants experience running large distributed clusters in production for four years. With BigCouch merged in, CouchDB will be able to replicate data at a much larger scale.<p>But wait! Thats not all! Cloudant has decided to terminate their BigCouch fork of CouchDB, and instead focus future development on Apache CouchDB. This is excellent news for CouchDB, even more excellent news for the CouchDB community.<p>Heres the original press release:<p>Cloudant Contributes Database Scalability and Fault-Tolerance Framework to Apache CouchDB<p>And here are some highlights from the press:<p>Sofa, so good ... BigCouch relaxes into comfy Apache CouchDB (The Register)<p>Cloudant pitches one CouchDB for all (GigaOM)<p>Cloudant Merges BigCouch Into Apache CouchDB (eWeek)<p>Cloudant Breathes Life Into CouchDB - Merges BigCouch into Apache Project (CMSwire)<p>CouchDB Gets Cloudant&#x27;s &#x27;Super-Size Me&#x27; Scaling (InformationWeek)<p>Cloudant Merges BigCouch Code into Apache Open Source Database (The WHIR)<p>Cloudant Merges BigCouch Database into Open Source Apache CouchDB (The VAR Guy)<p>Cloudant merges distributed BigCouch code with Apache CouchDB (JAXenter)<p>Cloudant contributes database scalability and fault-tolerance framework to Apache CouchDB (SD Times)<p>P.S. Cloudant is also hosting a party at OSCON on July 25 to celebrate the news. (Theyre booth #305 if youre at the show.) And if all that wasnt enough, stay tuned for news about a CouchDB conference that we should be announcing shortly<p>Posted at 06:26PM Jul 25, 2013 by Noah in News  |  Comments[0]  |",1374781592

Do you think you have the time to run every aspect of the country? If you don&#x27;t, then you need to delegate the authority to run those things to others. And then the people who are doing those jobs become the rulers in those areas.<p>And those areas are going to have to work together, at which point you get hierarchies and people similar to managers and fairly rapidly you end up with what we&#x27;d call a government.<p>If you believe there&#x27;s a better way to run things, then start a company that works in a more egalitarian manner and scale it. As I understand it though, companies that work even vaguely like that have never scaled well beyond a few hundred people at most - i.e. Dunbar&#x27;s number.<p>If you want to solve the problem of people needing a government there are serious questions about complexity and conscientiousness (do people even want to run their own affairs?) and how people are meant to work together when they can&#x27;t know everything about all the areas they&#x27;d have to oversee without empowering others even if they just did that as their full time job.<p>So, my answer to why do I think people need rulers is, essentially, that equality doesn&#x27;t seem to scale well to the sorts of problems that a country would have to address at the moment - and, implicitly, that anywhere that decides not to be a country anymore is going to get walked all over by anyone that decides to still be a country.",1374781240

For example, if your data is on a US-owned company cloud in any country in the world it can be accessed by US authorities without the knowledge of clients; a fact openly admitted by the US Government.<p>DigitalOcean demonstrated there is demand for a more modern approach to cloud provision, and with no legacy baggage to slow them down they were able to offer this at a lower cost than rivals. They recognized that many bigger, more-established rivals were so heavily invested in legacy technology they had fallen behind.<p>In response to these developments a few of us got together to consider an alternative (we are devs and system admins). Our own clients were concerned about developments in the US, prompting us to take action.<p>We recognized the need for a DigitalOcean, but also realized it is no longer viable for our own clients now or in the future.<p>This prompted us to put our experience to good use and we created RocketCloud: It is unashamedly like DigitalOcean, but based in London and completely outside US legal jurisdiction.

They literally do not care how the headphones sound to the buyer, just how they look and how much they cost.<p>In the back of the store, by the musical instruments and &quot;DJ&quot; stuff there is another headphones display. This display has gear from companies that actually make a good product for music. Sennheiser, Pioneer, the good stuff. This section is completely abandoned and nobody cares about this stuff, which is why the section has been shrinking to make more room for Monster HDMI cables and the like.<p>Best Buy also has a car stereo section, which is unsurprisingly less than fantastic as well. They carry speakers that are designed with loudness in mind far before sound quality--but they&#x27;ll tell you they sound great, and most consumers will listen to the expert on stereos in the blue shirt and khakis. Head units are toted as having apps and dvd players and all the gadgets, but no mention of sound quality is ever made with the units.

But I think the idea is not that your code would be a self-sustaining open source project because it&#x27;s especially useful as code, but rather that people (for example here) would be willing to help you do your work for free because they support the mission of your organization. A sort of &quot;in-kind&quot; donation of their time and energy and expertise, right?<p>I definitely think that between your admirable mission and the prestige of your network you could certainly be getting lots of free help and resources beyond just cash donations. If you could develop a workflow (via open source or some other mechanism) to take advantage of volunteer engineer labor, you could presumably pursue whatever software goals you have radically faster, I would think.",1374780203

There have also been controversies over books linking to Amazon when referring to other books you might buy (as their print editions do) [2].

6104279,comment,6103350,6103700,5,0,wpietri,,,"When clients ask you why, the answer I give is that professional services people typically bill about 1000 hours a year. The rest of the time goes to sales, marketing, learning new tools, and other non-billable work.<p>That said, once you are consistently busy, you should raise your rates, just like the article says. When clients ask you about <i>that</i> rate, just say, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s what other new clients are paying.&quot; Nobody can really argue with that.<p>I&#x27;ve also found a lot of value in having a high headline rate that I discount when I actually want the work.",1374778861

It&#x27;s surprisingly easy to trigger the cpu throttling on a micro instance.<p>Would be nice if they could/would average out the cpu usage over a longer rolling window. That&#x27;d be perfect for a use case like this (build server) where you&#x27;re idle the majority of the time but want to max out cpu during the build itself. Seems like the perfect use case for a shared server.",1374778829

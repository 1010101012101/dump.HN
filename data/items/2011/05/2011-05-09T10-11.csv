Like so white once I got back to the US everything else looked yellow. I was never able to find what she used at home once I came back to the US so I thought it was this, TSP. Turns out that adding a little bit of blue dye to whites makes them extra bright. And I do remember the blue box next to the wash.<p>So your clothes aren't dirtier, they are stained.

Apple has complete control over iPhones, and they decide what you can and cannot do with it: this is ""evil"", according to FSF's philosophy.<p>From a purely capitalistic point of view: a software developer gets an incentive to create and evolve software if it was closed source and hard to crack so that he could sell it and get profit.

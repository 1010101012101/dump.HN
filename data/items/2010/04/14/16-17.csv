Tier 1's have complained about low cost pricing from Cogent for a while now but complaining about a company few have heard of doesn't make headlines.<p>They don't demand peering regulation because I think they want to avoid the complex system of termination fees and special rules for smaller carriers etc. that regulation of the phone system brought.

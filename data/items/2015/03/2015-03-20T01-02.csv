9235861,comment,9231896,9233073,0,0,dfox,,,"In the first place, LL(1) parser for BER/DER is mostly trivial exercise, although somewhat tedious.<p>Problem with ASN.1 is not with the specification itself but mostly in the fact that many people want to parse BER/DER with code that directly populates some application-specific data structure and depends on ASN.1 syntax of what they expect to parse. With that you invariably get very complex interface between parser library and application where both components have to handle various special cases correctly (to the point that the whole thing is not even leaky abstraction, because it almost isn&#x27;t abstraction at all).",1426816651

Now you have places serving &#x27;Nordic Cuisine&#x27; (Noma, Faviken), Spanish cuisine has had a resurgence in a major way (Arzak, Etxebarri), South American cuisine is becoming recognized at the highest levels (D.O.M.,  Central), as is Asian cuisine (too many to list), there&#x27;s &#x27;avant garde&#x27; (El Bulli and the Adria brothers&#x27; other ventures, Alinea), and then you&#x27;ve got the chefs who break all the rules and just create whatever they want at the time (Pierre Gagnaire comes to mind).

Here&#x27;s what I think:<p>>>I mean, the Merlin-1D has really good thrust to weight ratio, but the actual amount of thrust and the ISP at sea level is lacking compared to, say, the space shuttle&#x27;s main engines (even with +30% the 1D is going to come short of 1,000 kN thurst, whereas the RS-25 on the shuttle was 1,860 kN).<p>The Saturn&#x27;s F1 engine had an even lower Isp, and was also KeroLox.  Your focus on Isp is a bit misguided.  Sure the SSME&#x27;s have a stellar Isp, but guess what? The shuttle solid rocket boosters had a terrible Isp (Shuttle basically ran the RS-25 at lift off only to verify they&#x27;d start. They weren&#x27;t throttled up until well into flight). When it comes to hauling millions of pounds off the launch pad, past the tower, Isp is not what you want. You want mass expelled at a tremendous rate. In other words, why not use electric ion engines with >2000 Isp for the first stage?  Thrust to weight matters on lift off is why.",1426816033

Thanks to you and others, I am achieving that goal. As far as the reaction goes, I do not consider any one reaction &quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot;, they are all different and interesting to me.<p>The &quot;strawman&quot; example was actually just a timely (today) inspiration for framing an idea I&#x27;ve held for a while; there are other examples of similar ilk. I just thought Tesla was a nice modern one because they accomplish things that are beyond the average person&#x27;s sense of what is possible similiar to the great minds of the past.<p>The notion that someone who claims they are going to do something in the future is lying in the traditional sense-- is indeed horseshit. However, that was not the point of the example or the article.<p>The purpose of the article (and all examples) was to show that it is not possible to make provably true or false statements about the past and future.<p>The use of the terms &quot;liar&quot; and &quot;lying&quot; throughout the article are used in an attempt to show how the value judgements we associate with &quot;lying&quot; are somewhat generalized considering that Galileo and the like are obviously NOT liars, but were made out to be so at the time.<p>I felt it was necessary to examine this aspect of something that otherwise would be looked it in a purely logical (and therefore somewhat impractical) manner.<p>The purpose was not to call innovators liars. The purpose was to illustrate how the process of factual dispute and reconciliation of past events is the same as the process of the creation of new events (innovation).<p>A truly strawman example would disintegrate when debated in the context of the principles it was representing. Yet, the principle it represents in this case is that we must use our actions to make the statements about the future or the past reflect reality.<p>Tesla declaring their intention and then successfully turning the Model S into a self-steering car is a perfect example of just that.<p>Do I take it then that you have since read the rest of it? :)",1426816024

9235807,comment,9233825,9235578,0,0,westoncb,,,"Interesting—had no idea the 24 hour insulins were so new.<p>I think that also explains a certain trend I&#x27;ve seen with insulin usage guidelines (typically) given by doctors, versus by learned users. I found at first independently, then later had the finding corroborated, that using meal-time insulin (e.g. Humalog) was too unpredictable: too many factors are involved; blood sugar almost always go too high or too low—and, unpredictability varies with dose size (even while &#x27;appropriately&#x27; matched by carbs). So, many people, including myself decide that since the lowest dose is most predictable, use zero (this is a Type 1 speaking)—zero meal-time insulin that is—and compensate by eating an extremely small number of carbs. This is only possible because I have the 24 hour insulin running in the background, however. My perplexity about it was that doctors seem unaware of this strategy (in my experience, which, while limited does extend to several doctors, and I hear this consistently from other diabetics). Instead, there&#x27;s this myth that you just calculate your carbs, match with insulin—everything&#x27;s good! But if it&#x27;s only been around for 11 years or so, I guess it takes a while for the literature to catch up.<p>The other side of the situation, at the risk of sounding unappreciative, is that it feels like I&#x27;m paying Tesla prices, but still opt to get out and walk most of the time since the car is so bad.<p>Better blood sugar monitoring tech (e.g. continuous) and quicker meal-time insulins would seriously improve things. Quicker is better since carbs convert to blood sugar more rapidly than the insulin acts—unless I take a large insulin dose. That&#x27;s another aspect of insulin&#x27;s unpredictability: its processing rate is proportional to dose size, so there isn&#x27;t just one ratio of insulin-to-carbs—though one could still infer their dose->(insulin units/gram of carbs) function :)",1426815706

Headed to the track one Saturday morning in said track car, a car in front of me pulled out of the lane to avoid a big a-- bird in the road. Partly because I <i>have</i> to be alert in that car and partly the car itself I managed to treat the bird more like an obstacle course and (narrowly) avoid it.  The dumb thing started running off the road then back into my lane(!). Anyway the point is in my Corolla no way would I have reacted in time, while I think I&#x27;m conscientious I know my alertness level is way higher in the track day car - it&#x27;s low, small, has a brutally fast steering rack - a single moment of inattention you&#x27;d get away with in Corolla would see you in the ditch in the other car. 3 hours drive in both cars and one of them I&#x27;m pretty happy to have a little break afterwards!<p>A byproduct of the environment, I think autonomous cars/controls are going to reduce the level of awareness and concentration and you&#x27;ll have some pretty nasty &quot;I don&#x27;t know what happened&quot; crashes when things happen that the systems can&#x27;t respond to and human has to drive out of it.<p>Of course the flip side of the coin, and I can fully appreciate is the reduction of crashes where people doze off and plough right into the back of other cars.

on a career in such applied math, I can&#x27;t
think of any.  Mostly people and their
organizations would rather waste money
than get involved with mathematicians
doing work only mathematicians understand.<p>Again, if want to make math pay, just sell
the results, usually as a vendor outside
the customer.<p>If are inside the company, then likely no
good work will go unpunished.  Basically
to be successful, you will need the strong
personal support of the CEO and hopefully
the Board -- literally.  And the CEO will
routinely have to go around and break 2 x
4s over the heads of recalcitrant middle
managers to see if they are just asleep or
really dead -- otherwise those middle
managers can sabotage you with high
determination and creativity.<p>E.g., twice I saved FedEx from going out
of business and had much more that would
have saved FedEx maybe tens of millions of
dollars a year, but I got flack and push
back and contempt and none of the promised
stock.<p>Such are some of the challenges in getting
<i>stuff done</i>. But successful people have
been overcoming challenges, some much
worse than I faced at FedEx, for many
centuries.<p>Now that you know about the possibilities
of some of the absurd challenges, don&#x27;t be
surprised.  Really, one of the best rules
is just to keep your good technical work
essentially a secret until you have a
solution that is just too darned good to
refuse, and then pull back the curtain,
let people see the results and also see
that it&#x27;s too late to fight with you.<p>Better still, just provide such results as
a business and <i>own</i> the business.  E.g.,
in some cases, just do the work for free,
show the results, and then announce &quot;You
can have this for your real operations for
a fee of only 15% of the savings.&quot;<p>Once there was an in-house research group
that was successful.  It was for WestVaco
paper -- think specialty papers, e.g.,
coated papers for milk cartons.  So, they
had Ph.D. chem eng guys running their
plants in jungles, etc., that is, where
the trees were, but it was a family owned
business with HQ in NYC.<p>The research shop was in Maryland, and I
got an explanation from them:  Each year
Research went to NYC for their budget.
Always the CEO, family guy, offered much
more money for the Research shop than the
shop was willing to accept (first-cut,
good budget situation!).<p>Why?  The rules:  Research picks their own
projects.  Projects tend to run from a few
months to a few years.  One project in 10
gets to operations.  When Research has a
project ready for operations, they
approach the relevant operational
managers.  In the first three years,
savings are allocated half to Research and
half to the operational unit.  After three
years, all the savings are allocated to
the operational unit.  With this
accounting, Research was returning $3 to
the company for each $1 in their budget.
So, sure, HQ wanted to increase the
budget, but Research didn&#x27;t want to have
to find ways to return $3 for each extra
budget $1 so didn&#x27;t want a bigger budget!<p>It is just crucial that the CEO is
supporting such in-house innovation.  The
rules are also important.<p>Ah, while I was in grad school, to make
enough money to support my wife and I
while we both finished our Ph.D.s, I took
a job at a DC area <i>think tank</i> working
for the US Navy.<p>At one point our <i>problem sponsor</i> group
wanted an analysis of a special, worrisome
<i>scenario</i> of global nuclear war but
limited to sea -- they wanted to know how
long the US SSBN fleet could survive if it
was just held in reserve and didn&#x27;t shoot
its missiles with nuke warheads.  And they
wanted the results in two weeks.<p>Gee, two weeks to model global nuclear war
limited to sea! How generous!  Good that
they were not in a real hurry! Besides it
was good timing since the day after the
due date my wife had already gotten us
reservations for a vacation at Shenandoah!<p>Well, there was a guy B. Koopman who in
WWII had written a report OEG-56 on
finding things at sea.  So, given A and B
wandering around at sea, when might they
have an <i>encounter</i>?  Well, Koopman took
the area of the sea, the two velocities,
and the detection radius and came up with
an arrival rate for a Poisson process.
Hmm ....<p>So, list the Red forces and Blue forces
(the US SSBNs were part of the Blue
forces), that is, list airplanes,
helicopters, destroyers, battleships,
attack submarines, etc., the speed of
each, and the detection radius.  Then have
a table with a row for each Blue weapon
type and a column for each Red weapon type
and the detection radius and, if there was
an encounter, the probability that one,
the other, or both died.<p>Now tap lightly with an independence
assumption (maybe not wildly unjustified),
realize that a sum of independent Poisson
processes is again a Poisson process with
arrival rate the sum of the contributing
arrival rates, and get for the <i>state</i> of
the war a continuous time, discrete state
space (very large from a combinatorial
explosion) Markov process <i>subordinated</i>
to a Poisson process.  So, yes, there is a
closed form solution as a matrix
exponential for the transition
probabilities from state to state, but
that matrix exponential is absurdly large.
Instead using Monte Carlo to run off, say,
500 sample paths was easy.  I typed in the
code.<p>Prof J. Keilson did a technical review.
He said, &quot;There&#x27;s no way you can fathom
that enormous state space.&quot;. I said, &quot;At
each point in time, say, 10 days into the
war, the number of SSBNs remaining is a
random variable.  Moreover it is bounded
so has finite expectation and finite
variance.  So, the law of large numbers
applies.  So, run off 500 independent,
identically distributed samples, add them
up, divide by 500, and get the expectation
within a gnat&#x27;s ass nearly all the time.
Really the Monte Carlo puts the effort
where the action is.&quot;.  He agreed with me
and passed my work.<p>The Navy got their results on time, and my
wife got her vacation on time.<p>Later I was told that my work had been
sold to a leading US intelligence agency.
I could tell you which one, but then I&#x27;d
have to ...!<p>I thought that the whole effort, which
ignored so much maybe crucially important
detail, was close to a joke, but,
surprisingly, the output did look
reasonable.  Also, the two weeks was also
so short it made the whole exercise next
to absurd, another joke.<p>The group I was working for didn&#x27;t trust
me to get results on time so had another
person working independently.  Well, at
the end of the two weeks, the other person
had nothing at all.  So, I&#x27;d won.<p>Office politics:  One guy said &quot;You write
nice computer programs&quot; and otherwise I
got no thanks but just some jealousy,
contempt, and silence.  So, soon afterward
when I&#x27;d gotten my Ph.D., I wanted to
leave and did.<p>Again, no good deed need go unpunished.<p>Again, own the business, use math as an
internal <i>secret sauce</i> and technological
advantage, and sell just the results.",1426813963

A better designation might be &quot;physical products&quot;.  It seems these discussions tend to ignore the fact that physical products are not simply circuit boards with a handful of chips and code.<p>As an example, we developed an advanced high power LED light source.  The design took a year of engineering.  During this time hundreds of LED&#x27;s and a myriad of circuit technologies and driving approaches were explored.  Thermal management alone required six months of iterating through a family of designs.  Initial designs were tested and fine tuned with thermal FEA tools and physical test candidates were machined in our CNC shop for real testing.<p>Past that, some of the advanced approaches we used required designing and building custom manufacturing tools and production test equipment.<p>Just think about the cost, not just in man-hours but also prototyping, testing, materials, regulatory, etc.<p>So it is because of this and over 30 years in the hardware manufacturing wold that I say, with all due respect, that the view being put forth is rather myopic and naive.  Fine for little Arduino type gizmos and perhaps even some chips but it breaks down very quickly once you start to hit what I am going to call &quot;the real world&quot;.  This is where reproducing or iterating a design might require an infrastructure in the hundreds of thousands of dollars and potentially deep multidisciplinary capabilities.<p>In the software world any 15 year old with enough motivation to dive into a large open source project can do so armed with a $200 laptop.

In short succession,
Novo introduced “monocomponent” insulins and
Lilly introduced “single-peak” insulins. These
safety improvements extended insulin patents
into the late 1980s...Although recombinant insulin was heavily advertised as a clinically superior
agent in the 1980s (Fig. 1), almost no evidence
was provided to demonstrate its superiority to
the best available animal-extract insulins. 26&quot;<p>> This makes it act roughly twice as fast as regular insulin, roughly matching the time taken for a meal to be digested and to enter the bloodstream -- thus reducing the postprandial &quot;peak&quot; and cutting down on the chronic hyperglycaemia related complications of diabetes...but it wasn&#x27;t until 2003 that the first &quot;24 hour&quot; insulin was released.<p>From the medical paper:<p>&quot;Although long-acting analogues cause less hypoglycemia than NPH does, 27 it has yet to be shown that analogues lead to better long-term outcomes than standard recombinant human insulin does. 28&quot;<p>> Because the insulin we&#x27;re using now is a heck of a lot better than the insulin 90 years ago.<p>&quot;On the whole, insulin today is
demonstrably safer and more convenient to use
than products available in 1923. But whether
each incremental innovation is worth the price
we pay, in a world where insulin remains unaffordable to many patients with diabetes, is less

They tend to generate nice little compiler errors (and warnings you can upgrade to errors), and the refactoring tends to be a straightforward 1:1 replacement affair.  Noticing the &quot;lock free&quot; code is just plain broken and testing the fixes tends to eat more time than the actual porting.<p>The &quot;abstractions&quot; written by those who don&#x27;t have multiplatform experience (aka the ones writing platform specific code in the first place) tend to have broken designs that require refactoring even if they do exist.  Very little difference in work between fixing a broken abstraction and implementing a missing abstraction for those items, IMO.<p>Unabstracted or poorly abstracted rendering, input, user management, matchmaking, leaderboards, achievements, save systems, async I/O, and platform specific serialization (image loaders, varying-size bytewise copied structs)... all without unit tests or an assertion between them... I find all much worse!  You get to refactor, redesign, and retest all at the same time, leaving behind a trail of breadcrumbs:  backwards compatability hacks and compromises...<p>(Also fun:  When you discover existing abstractions were discarded instead of cleaned up, in favor of new abstractions, and you get to re-fix all the re-introduced TCR violations and corner cases.)",1426813359

9235683,comment,9225683,9234968,0,0,graycat,,,"Part I<p>> Having started working mathematically
recently it seems to me that even though I
can propose a solution which isn&#x27;t the
best, they are usually better than what is
currently available. Is that a common
experience as a working mathematician.<p>Sure.  For the politics, just report the
savings.  The stuff about the <i>optimal</i>
solution, that is, its, say, <i>moral</i> or
<i>ethical</i> value, is lost on business
people.  With some good common sense, the
business people just want to know how much
has been saved (or extra earned).  If you
can also have, say, a lower bound on the
possible savings and get close to that,
then you have in practice a <i>stopping
criterion</i>. Or, what in practice is really
difficult about the NP-hard problems is
usually saving the very last possible tiny
fraction of one penny and proving that did
that.  Instead, just concentrate on
saving, say, the first $5 million a month
on, say, the $100 million a month of jet
fuel for an airline.<p>For a while in optimization, having the
<i>optimal</i> solution was made a moral
objective with anything that wasted even
0.0001 pennies regarded as a <i>sin</i>.
Religious nonsense.<p>Really sloppy work is not good, but close
approximation usually is plenty good.<p>For not the best, that&#x27;s the other time I
kept FedEx from going out of business:
The founder, Fred W. Smith, spent the
afternoon in his office trying to schedule
the fleet, staggered out exhausted, said
&quot;We need a computer&quot;, and a college friend
of mine heard that plea and called me.<p>Sure, digging in, I heard a lot about
<i>optimal</i> solutions.  But I knew that
first just get something that helps, say,
so can type in a schedule, have the
software check it out for, say, planes
being over loaded or having to fly too
far, get the arrival times, etc., and
print out all the details.  So, I typed in
6000 lines of code to do that.  Right,
great circle distances are from just the
law of cosines for spherical triangles!<p>Soon the Board wanted a schedule; biggie
Board members doubted that the scheduling
could even be done; biggie funding was
being held up; the company was at risk.<p>So, I got a call from the same guy who
called me to the Board meeting for the
revenue projections, Roger Frock (he wrote
a book about FedEx), and he and one short,
easy evening he and I used my software to
develop a schedule for the whole planned
system of 90 cities and 33 airplanes.  It
printed out and looked nice.<p>At the next senior staff meeting, Fred&#x27;s
reaction to the printout was &quot;Amazing
document -- solved the most important
problem facing Federal Express&quot;.  Our same
two guys from General Dynamics went over
the schedule carefully and announced &quot;It&#x27;s
a little tight in a few places but it&#x27;s
flyable&quot;. The Board was pleased; the
funding was enabled.  That was the first
time I saved FedEx.<p>So, I got into how to do better
scheduling.  So, for one period from, say,
5 PM to midnight (again from 1 AM to, say,
8 AM) set up a table with one row for each
city to be served, 90 cities, and one
column for each candidate airplane <i>tour</i>
from Memphis and back.  So, may have some
thousands of columns.  Considering all
fine details want to account for, and take
expectations for random costs, find for
each of the candidate tours the cost
(first cut, assume that if a plane goes to
a city, then it completely serves that
city).<p>Then for the schedule, want to pick no
more than 33 columns from the 1000s so
that all 90 cities are served and total
cost is minimized.<p>So, each column <i>covers</i> some cities, and
want to pick columns that <i>cover</i> all 90
cities -- so have a <i>set covering</i>
problem.  Right, it&#x27;s in NP-complete.<p>Well, that <i>table</i> is essentially the
matrix in a 0-1 integer linear programming
least cost optimization problem.  There
have one unknown variable for each of the
columns, and the variable is 1 if use that
column and 0 otherwise.  If relax the 0-1
constraint, then have a fairly routine
linear programming problem but will likely
end up with some <i>fractional</i> airplanes
allocated.  Could use branch and bound to
get to a good or optimal 0-1 solution.<p>Should have saved FedEx a huge bundle.
Now, with software such as the IBM
Optimization Subroutine Library (OSL),
C-PLEX (now owned by IBM but from Robert
Bixby at Rice in Dallas), etc., that would
be a fun and likely fairly easy problem.<p>Alas, for proposing that work as my
project, I got too much guff and flack
back from too much of the top of FedEx,
wasn&#x27;t getting much thanks for the two
times I&#x27;d saved the company, was not
seeing the promised stock, was away from
my home and wife, was in a company close
to going belly up, saw a lot of dumb work,
so went for my Ph.D.",1426813246

I changed the title to be less provocative because, even though both you and the author make a reasonable case for it, I fear that it&#x27;s too much for the thread to bear.

7539645,comment,7538972,7539297,1,0,nitrogen,,,"<i>People choose to do crime or to think differently.</i><p>One of the interesting conclusions one can draw from studies of physics and biology is that it&#x27;s highly likely that &quot;choice&quot; is really a very complex chemical process, rather than some independent act that a unified person entity performs in complete isolation from their brain and body.<p>Assuming for the sake of argument that this is completely true, I think we can make significant progress in improving people&#x27;s ability to &quot;choose&quot; by approaching the problem of detrimental or criminal choices from a biological and physical perspective -- that is, to use a rational, scientific approach to influencing brains and bodies as highly complex, sentient physical objects, rather than a moral, philosophical approach to distributing punishment and reward.",1396756718
7539644,comment,7538972,7539380,1,0,lovemenot,,,"Uniformity of behavior may not be inherently anti-theft in all circumstances. What I see this happening in japan though is that, to a larger extent than I have seen elsewhere, people are consistently, almost uniformly, pro-social. Group consideration tends to trump individual opportunity. Consider the different value of cost/benefit to society and to the criminal of a criminal act. I am arguing that Japanese will tend to see the social cost more than the individual benefit, even when they themselves may be the beneficiary.\nAnd on the other side of this coin, as we have been discussing; the same social consideration tends to make people more reluctant to force unwanted (disruptive) changes on others who might be hurt in the short term.",1396756695

7539626,comment,7539287,7539591,1,0,jkrems,,,"The title is silly - but it means that when testing 3D applications (and even more so VR), it might be dangerous to only test it on males since that can lead to equipment that is not suitable for women. So depending on how much work the Oculus guys are putting into making it &quot;usable for people of both genders&quot; vs. &quot;testing it with male participants only/mostly&quot;, the product might be excluding women. And thus be sexist. The title is clearly link bait, the article and its implications pretty interesting though (imo).",1396756258

I was having coffee with her a year or so ago, when I had just received my devkit, and she was up in arms about how terrible motion sickness was on the Rift.<p>&quot;I was telling companies back then that their VR tech was doomed from the start because of nausea, and it hasn&#x27;t changed at all!&quot;<p>This is a good tale of why having a more balanced gender ratio in the tech industry is important. If 90% of Oculus designers/prototypers/engineers are male, female voices will naturally get drowned. The problem is that if your audience is potentially &quot;all humans&quot;, the ratio is 50/50.\n(although here, it seems like a) there exists prior research in the literature and b) good user testing could highlight that problem. If you&#x27;re aspiring to doing any form of quality R&D, being on top of those 2 things should be a priority)<p>As for the title, I initially disliked it, but as I read the article I changed my opinion - I find it perfectly correct and just the right dose of irreverentious. The way I interpret it is as follows: it would be correct to label a poison which systematically kills any man who drinks it but not women as &quot;sexist&quot;. The problem is that our culture tends to bundle intent with sexism, which is not the case - whether a process is sexist or not is completely independent from intent, or even whether there is a sentient agent behind it.",1396756225

The article is clear to focus on hormones and <i>biological factors</i>, while most modern theories treat gender as a <i>social construct</i>, explicitly disconnected from actual biological factors.<p>So the mention here is adding no value at best, at worst it uses the term in a way that no longer matches up with the research around it.<p>(Not to mention that Oculus is <i>actively working</i> to reduce the factors that cause sickness (the one discussed here certainly isn&#x27;t the only one))<p>edit: might the downvotes explain themselves?

From an economic standpoint, it basically is, but it might be hard to unravel the knots there.<p>It&#x27;s even worse than that. Imagine you find some indigent person and he put his name down as the owner of the business, then you sell him the assets necessary to do business and various consulting services, all on credit. Let the loan payments be well in excess of the profits the business is expected to make, so that he always pays you every dime the business makes and still owes more and accumulates late fees etc. Almost immediately he comes to owe more than the business is worth and so all the profits the business makes will perpetually go to you.<p>You can&#x27;t cleanly distinguish a loan from an investment.

Choosing a behavioral and societal change vs. technological is always a trade off - but for this case some things make improving the technology much easier. The median age of a car in the US is about 11 years vs. 36 years for homes. Cars are individually replaced whereas reconfiguring homes that are on fixed land is a much more difficult task. If you&#x27;re asking about an individual level I agree it&#x27;s a choice, and you&#x27;ve covered those pain points say within a metro area. However if your family is in many South/West cities - say the Houston metro area or Las Vegas, distances are going to be pretty far. Amazingly, Los Angeles actually has pretty low average miles per year - one of the lowest for metro areas.<p>While the technological advancement is pretty much a universal win, the behavioral change isn&#x27;t, or is at least debatable/not everyone&#x27;s cup of tea - a lot of Americans prefer to live in large houses with lower density neighborhoods (of course others prefer large dense cities). Many also live in rural or semi-rural areas, and the US has a lot of cheap land compared to say Western Europe. Zoning in a city is dictated by those residents. However with better technology and cheaper energy, the expense of this lifestyle will be lowered and allow more choices (similar to how remote work allows people to remove geographical limitations). If we think about developing countries, any efficiency gains will also reduce their energy impact as consumption increases",1396755156

So here it is again, edited for the present context and updated with my recent thoughts:</i><p>People do seem to misinterpret MPG ratings. A study published in <i>Science</i> in 2008 [1] found that participants consistently overvalued vehicles with high MPG ratings. They assigned values linear in MPG rather than linear in its inverse.<p>The study&#x27;s authors told participants to &quot;assume you drive 10,000 miles per year for work, and this total amount cannot be changed.&quot; The participants were then asked to come up with values for vehicles of varying fuel-efficiencies. That is just the sort of optimization problem people face when choosing which car to buy, and apparently a fuel-efficiency metric that puts the amount of fuel in the numerator makes the problem easier to solve because expenditure is proportional to the amount of fuel burned, at least when distance driven is taken as given.<p>But in reading many of the words expended on this topic over the last couple of years, my lasting impression is that this a lot of hullabaloo about the wrong problem. It&#x27;s the lack of attention paid to the &quot;miles&quot; part of the equation that most needs fixing. If the goal is to reduce carbon emissions (or any of the other negative externalities of driving), then taking distance driven as fixed frames the problem in a way that obscures the real solution: we should be encouraging people to drive less.<p>Yes, reordering your daily life to drive fewer miles is more disruptive than simply buying a car that goes farther on a gallon of gas. And, granted, once you&#x27;ve chosen your style of life, minimizing the amount of gas you burn as you go about your daily routine is the thing to do (even if your optimization problem is a purely financial one). All the same, it&#x27;s ludicrous to ignore the basic inefficiency of the suburban lifestyle that predominates in America while we wait for automotive engineers to come up with clever solutions to pricey gas and to carbon emissions that are twice as high per capita as in similarly wealthy countries.<p>Elon Musk isn&#x27;t going to save us all by himself. Surely living closer to where you work, using mass transit, cycling, and walking more must be part of the solution as well. ... So maybe houses and apartments should come with a &quot;miles per day&quot; rating suggesting how far you&#x27;d travel getting to and from shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, and your place of work every day you live there. ...<p>0. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4020885"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4020885</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5883/1593.summary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/320/5883/1593.summary</a> (paywalled); <a href=""http://nsmn1.uh.edu/dgraur/niv/theMPGIllusion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nsmn1.uh.edu/dgraur/niv/theMPGIllusion.pdf</a> [PDF]",1396754046

This example is idiomatic;<p><pre><code>     grep -c foo * | uniq | sort -rn\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s more than possible to structure C programs this way internally too, elegant even. Use forks and pipes if you want to keep it simple, build co-routines if you&#x27;re up for it. It&#x27;s probably the most practical and beneficial way you can re-apply the lessons of FP to C.<p>But the book doesn&#x27;t mention either technique - just weird and ugly tricks to emulate tail-recursion, cons et al, probably the least effective parts of FP to try to use in C.",1396753386

7539517,comment,7537958,7539479,3,0,mehrdada,,,"Relatively short description of the design goal:<p>The goal of an encryption scheme is to provide confidentiality. It is important to know that most traditional encryption schemes, like block ciphers in CBC, CTR, OFB modes, do not provide any authenticity, i.e. while you cannot recover the plaintext from a ciphertext, you might be able to feed the decryption algorithm a ciphertext that you crafted, without the decryption algorithm having a means for detecting its lack of authenticity (e.g. flipping a bit in ciphertext generated with CTR mode will result in a flipped bit in decrypted plaintext), and in effect, making the system do things that an adversary wants it to do. In practice, this can often be more dangerous than loss of confidentiality.<p>In order to add authenticity to an encryption scheme, you would traditionally apply a separate message authentication algorithm to the ciphertext and the initialization vector to generate an <i>authentication tag</i>, which you can then use to verify if the ciphertext was tampered with.<p>There are many ways this combination can go wrong (and has gone) due to design and implementation mistakes, like sharing the key for the MAC and encryption algorithms, not authenticating the IV, not verifying the tag correctly and exposing yourself to timing attacks, applying the MAC to plaintext, as opposed to the ciphertext, etc.. For this reason, and performance implications, it is desirable to have encryption schemes that also somehow provide authenticity almost &quot;for free&quot;, as a natural byproduct of the ciphertext generation. Encryption schemes that achieve that, like OCB, CCM, CWC, and GCM modes, are called Authenticated Encryption.<p>Most of the regular authenticated encryption schemes rely on passing a unique number when encrypting each message, called nonce or initialization vector. For instance, encrypting more than one message with AES in GCM mode with the same nonce will result in total loss of authenticity, among other things. Therefore, they are not very resistant to accidental misuse, and extreme care should be taken while using them.<p>AEZ, on the other hand, strives to be a more robust authenticated encryption scheme in the face of nonce reuse (misuse), that is, it will not face a catastrophic loss of security if a nonce is accidentally reused.",1396753266

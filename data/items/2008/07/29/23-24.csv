261281,comment,260421,261160,0,0,gm,,,"You ask about how many open source projects I manage.  None.  I am a completely private sector guy.<p>I've done a lot with $5K; employing that focus I talked about.<p>I was not taking a shot at anyone, nor at open source.  Just at resources vs resource administration.  I do not know which project this was (I know the guy mentioned it on his post), nor do I particularly care.  A resource is a resource and a manager is a manager.  A project that is in development must move forward, open source or not.<p>Case in point:  We are using a certain OSS project in house.  We ran into a bug, it's a well-known bug, been there for a long time.  We fixed it because we had a time motive, resources, and focus.  Right there: done.  No hesitating, we needed to move onto something else.  That kind of focus would certainly help OSS.  $5K or not in our pocket, it was fixed.<p>Anyway...  That may very well explain why private projects move faster than open source ones, the private ones have a profit motive, failure means financial failure.  No matter how altruistic you are, if you fail financially, you don't eat.",1217375240

I am certain that, absent the government, quite a bit of transportation would be demanded and provided in the free market. The quantity of roads or rail produced might be less without all the subsidies, but I'm not sure this would be a bad thing. It would certainly be easier on the environment, since transportation tends to be resource-intensive.<p>The amount of transportation produced in the free market would be equal to the amount that people were willing to pay for, and that seems fair to me. Producing roads that people aren't willing to voluntarily pay for is a social loss. The people paying for the roads would rather use their money for other things.

Roads would not happen without massive government subsidies either.<p>The marginal road might not be profitable, but some roads  would be built without subsidies. The earliest highways in America were funded by private businessmen who thought it would be profitable to connect the towns that they lived in. Private roads have a long and successful history, even if in modern times they have been crowded out of the market by trillions of dollars of federal and state projects.<p>One of the four great intercontinental railroads was built entirely without government grants or subsidies. If I recall correctly, it also lasted the longest.<p>When I criticize the government or question the need for its existence, people often respond with ""Oh yeah, how would you get around without roads? The government provides all our transportation. That's useful."". However, the argument is a straw man, historically ignorant, and blinded by the status quo. Too often people are so constrained by how things are that they can not think about how they were different in the past or how they could be in the future.",1217372684

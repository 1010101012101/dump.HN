Selection bias is bias. The media is never going to cover every fact about a company, and there are different facts that will portray anyone in a different light. See: If-by-whiskey.[1] And if you're worried about affecting their image instead of the speaker's, you pick one side and silence the other. If you decide you like someone, you report only the positive facts about them and viewers like them too. If you decide you don't like them you report only the negative facts and viewers don't like them either. You can do this without telling a single lie, and it's enormously effective because no one can disprove anything you report since it's all true, it's just intentionally incomplete.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-by-whiskey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If-by-whiskey</a>",1364306370

But I agree with your worry that this looks to be instructions that could put anyone who follows them at even higher risk of pain.  The aesthetic of the web site doesn't give me a warm and fuzzy feeling about the quality of the tools being promoted.<p>That said, I suspect a key point the author would make in response to our concern is that we can vigorously backup the server hosting our contacts and calendar when we host these ourselves.  In fact, this point is precisely why I host so much of my own stuff: I can manage how data is handled.  Synchronization notoriously sucks, and if some synchronization failure causes many records to suddenly vanish, it would be easier to restore those records from a self-maintained server than to plead with Google's support.  I wouldn't know the first thing about recovering synchronization-scrubbed records from the devices themselves (e.g., an Android phone).<p>I suppose it would attack your point about ""better backup"" by asking what value that backup has if you can't easily leverage it to restore on demand.<p>Still, I feel your points about quality, redundancy, and uptime could not be easily countered.",1364306306

The language has its quirks, but the virtual machine is fantastic, and it really makes it easier to manage massive concurrency, which is almost always the case on the server side.<p>If you find the language too strange, you should also check Elixir, a Ruby flavored language which compiles to the Erlang bytecode and can normally cooperate with other Erlang code. Starting this year, I am adding new feature for my Erlang based system using Elixir as much as possible.
At the moment, you should really be familiar with Erlang to be able to fully understand and utilise Elixir.<p>Other alternatives to Erlang would be Go, Scala/Akka, or reactor based platforms such as node.js or EventMachine. Also, probably Haskell and Clojure, but I'm not really familiar with those. Personally, I find them all to be inferior to Erlang VM, although Go and especially Scala/Akka are really close. I wouldn't recommend reactors despite my great affection for both Ruby and Javascript.<p>Some detailed ramblings on what I really love about Erlang can be found on my blog:

One of my applications, as an example, has 52MB of jar files. That's compressed data. Now, I am not sure how that eventually equates to how much ram is used to load these files (and I know that not every class will be loaded), but unzipping these jars ends up with over 203 megs of data. I have to have a large PermGen.<p>Perhaps the tool you install should be showing the number of classes loaded and the size of the code in general. But, again what's in a jar file can't tell you how many classes will be loaded because many common API such as hibernate and spring generate thousands and thousands of dynamic proxies that end up being stored in memory for the lifetime of that application.<p>The data also doesn't show if the higher heap users tested out running a lower PermGen/Heap and ran out of memory, hence their increased size. I'd rather allocate too much memory though than run out of memory at a peak time and have one of my hospitals deal with downtime because I saved $25 worth of RAM.<p>Anyway, I'll read the followup but I hope it has more info.

Your last sentence applies just as well to ""loud fans"".]<p>This is as wrong as calling the technological singularity idea a ""rapture of the nerds.""[1] It's important to separate religious-minded-thinking, which is more generally irrational (or if you prefer a less general statement for the sake of argument, non-scientific) thinking, from an actual religion. Do atheists suffer from the same cognitive biases religious people do? Of course. Do some of them (I'd guess a minority) make errors in probabilistic reasoning by assigning p(a god exists|observations) = 0, actual 0, rather than the technical 0+epsilon that permits Bayesian updating in case a god ever decides to show itself? Sure. None of this makes atheism a religion. Where's the promise of salvation, but only for atheists? Where's the Holy Book? Where's the rituals and traditions? Are you called an ""inactive atheist"" if you don't go to chu^H^H^H weekly meetups and thus get shunned by your fellow atheists? Where's the singular code of morality? Where are the articles of faith?

America of today would be hesitant to bring the full force of its military down on a militant group if the group could successfully paint themselves as freedom fighters.<p>This would only work if the revs were in response to a truly tyrannical act, say if a president were to declare a state of emergency and indefinitely suspend elections. Think of the Arab Spring, Waco Texas, or the negative response to police brutality on the OWS protestors.

My mom had a similar career path to your father - she was hired out of college in the late 60s with zero programming experience by one of the railways to work on scheduling systems.<p>There is one difference, though - the opportunity to learn programming (actually, to learn most things) has exploded in the past few decades.  In 1969, I think you needed access to expensive technology (like a mainframe) to have the opportunity to learn.  Now, a few hundred bucks and a web connection gets you started.  So if someone wants to be hired into a programming position with no experience in 2013, that does say something about the candidate that it didn't say in 1969.",1364303112

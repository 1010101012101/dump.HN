But every time I hear about a new Python release I keep hoping that I'll see they've finally reversed their policy about lambdas and made a real one instead of the compromise they have right now.",1214060241

223693,comment,223654,223676,0,0,mojuba,,,"I never liked that either, but the new version is physically longer and requires more typing. Moreover, I couldn't find any change in 3.0 that results in less typing. I might have missed something of course, but this announcement doesn't seem to be something to be excited about.<p>I was waiting, for example, lambdas to be allowed to have compound statements. Python, a nice language otherwise, could have been improved in many ways, none of which is found in 3.0.<p>Instead, the spirit of Python is coming closer and closer to Java: you are not supposed to do this, says Python to you, because it's a bad practice and can lead to errors.<p>I'm disappointed and I think I'd rather wait for another, more concise <i>nobraces</i> programming language.",1214059037

Yes, we don't have yet the perfect tools to do so, but it's definitely doable, and 20 years ago it wasn't even a dream. \nAlso I'm more inclined to invest into it: I got much more enjoyment from Evil Dead then from any current blockbuster - 90% of which I don't even watch anymore).",1214057938

Not taking a bath on the other hand certainly affects the quality of life of those around you.<p>Being able to turn off one entire power station because soft standby has been disabled is a small step, but as the cost is insignificant why do you care that the step is only small?<p>One thing you see from incrimental programming is that waiting for the 'final answer' doesn't work, but a large number of small steps does.

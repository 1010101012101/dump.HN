In order to work on these computers on wheels, mechanics need access to trouble codes, and information on this new technology.  They aren&#x27;t giving it up to independent repair shops.  We are being forced to bring our ailing computers to Dealerships, at dealership prices?<p>I know a dealership mechanic and he told me even with the proprietary scan tool, and access to the companies database; he spends hours a week learning every new upgrade, and feature these newer cars/trucks are implementing.  He said it&#x27;s usually on the customer&#x27;s dime.<p>We need to standardize, and I believe, even mandate that if a person buys a automobile; they will have access to all the repair information for that particular vechicle.<p>I foresee a junk yards getting bigger, and bigger, with cars that no one car work on, or worse--just crushing  the vechicle when that transmission with 10 sensors, and two computers fails?<p>A note to mechanics; I know the amount of ongoing learning you gave to do in order to keep your job.  I know your employer expects you to learn this new technology on your time.  If these vechicles keep going in the direction I think we are already at(too complicated, and car companies refusing to release data), it might me a the right time to unionize in certain counties?  With unionization you could afford Lobbiests, and in the end you would be paid what you are worth, with retirement benefits?  With paid training on all these propiatiary systems?

I gave a family member who has a 1996 Dodge  Dakota.  After years of working on it, I can repair the vechicle, but I spent a lot of time learning how to flash the computer, and only got the software because I have a buddy at a dealership.

That&#x27;s one of the main reasons for stagnant wages of late - total compensation has been increasing but the increase is flowing into benefits - thus flat income.<p>I have been thinking myself about the issue of inequality and think it&#x27;s being obfuscated by the language used (whereby it&#x27;s discussed in terms of rich vs poor instead of US poor vs foreign poor).<p>Ie - how are the wages for the top 1% (lawyers, doctors, bankers, etc) affecting the wages for the bottom 50%?

In economic terms, when the platform is open and unregulated and anything goes, there is a large consumer surplus. People go to a centralized discussion platform because it offers some sort of technical surplus (ease-of-use, attractive appearance, social proof in the form of karma points or whatever) which they don&#x27;t get otherwise. But as a platform becomes popular, there&#x27;s a larger and larger cost in operating it, so you charge or add adverts or something. But now the people who are paying want additional value for their outlay over and above the basic consumer surplus, and usually that value is in the form of security from unwanted interaction, whether for their persona or their commercial brand. So for the producer to recoup the costs of operating the platform and reap some producer surplus from doing so (or why bother), the goal is to find a equilibrium between the degree of security provided and the partial loss of the original consumer surplus (of unrestricted communication).<p>Now it seems to me that this is a two-part thing. A site like Reddit dies a little if they institute behavior standards...but only a little bit. Trolls may leave altogether and the community becomes a bit more homogeneous, but then it can run for ages and ages. For example, people still log into AOL and many other moribund platforms - if there are enough people talking who are OK with the behavior standards it will keep going. What really kills it is the emergence of a new platform which offers substantial technical advantages in its turn (way better UI, super speed, brilliant new threading mechanism or whatever).<p>Because most of the effort on the new platform is technological, there may not be any behavior standards in place and so the first people onto that platform enjoy the freedom of saying/doing whatever they want, and the platform producers probably don&#x27;t mind as they want to get people onboard to take advantage of the network effect. But only a percentage of the people are attracted to the new platform because of the behavioral freedom, whereas the majority are attracted by a combination of technical superiority and network effects.<p>I think Tor is a good example of this; you can fire up Tor and freely explore all sorts of contraband stuff if you&#x27;re so inclined and not too paranoid. But if you&#x27;re not after forbidden fruit, then the user experience of Tor is pretty bad (not due to some fundamental flaw of Tor, but the .onion ecosystem). The privacy benefits don&#x27;t offer sufficient utility for most people to justify the awful UX unless you are looking for something very obscure (<5%) or just illegal (>95%). Probably 80% of the onion links I click don&#x27;t even load, and since I&#x27;m not looking to buy drugs or criminal services exploring the .onion domain is generally a complete waste of time.<p><i>As far as decentralized protocols, &quot;identity verification&quot; is much stronger than what&#x27;s needed and would be the path to madness (open to legal extortion, etc).

Humanity is the source of intent, and there is no independent evolutionary mechanism competing with that. Without humans, there is not even a process to automate.</i><p>Some very intelligent people are quick to jump aboard the &quot;AI existential crisis&quot; train without considering the larger evolutionary picture. We are not separate from the computer systems we create, they exist in a symbiotic relationship with us and they are driven by <i>our</i> basic needs. Our basic needs are driven by the emergent biological properties of our bodies and our ecosystem. While it can be argued with our &quot;intelligence&quot; we do harm to these things, it is not in our best interest to eliminate them. Machines (and automation) are just logical <i>necessarily biological</i> extensions of humanity. Silicon is just life&#x27;s next evolutionary step.

Easy and lengthy intro then steep but short core material (often cut short because the bell is ringing). Impossibly annoying.<p>The dark room exhaustive search is exactly how I ended up learning about learning. Through music though, as a self taught I had to visit every possible spots, even if most of them were holes. And most of the time, most things only &#x27;make sense&#x27; because the other things just don&#x27;t work. Now if you teach a topic to someone by listing what &#x27;make sense&#x27;, unless that person is very easy on remembering or extremely creative, it will be a meaningless burden to rote learn. On the other hand, knowing all the wrong parts, makes you very good at teaching someone since as the student will ask why his intuition is failing, you know how it feels and you know what to do about it, how to try other ideas, patterns, revisit things that he might have overseen.<p>Douglas Crockford said that once you understand monads, you suffer the curse of not being able to explain it anymore. I really wonder how often this happen, how many students learned shortened and polished stuff in books without the whole story, the whole experience of the actual researcher ?

[0] gives a good view of the family tree.<p>And the reason they&#x27;re so far apart is that they must have migrated there from the north. From Wikipedia [1]:<p>> The Apachean languages, of which Navajo is one, are thought to have arrived in the American Southwest from the north by 1500 CE, probably passing through Alberta and Wyoming.[14][15] Archeological finds considered to be proto-Navaho have been located in the far northern New Mexico around the La Plata, Animas and Pine rivers, dating to around 1500. In 1936 linguist Edward Sapir showed how the arrival of the Navajo people in the new arid climate among the corn agriculturalists of the Pueblo area was reflected in their language by tracing the changing meanings of words from proto-Athabaskan to Navaho. For example the word <i>dè: which in proto-Athabaskan meant &quot;horn&quot; and &quot;dipper made from animal horn&quot; in Navaho came to mean &quot;gourd&quot; or &quot;dipper made from gourd&quot;. Likewise the proto-Athabaskan word </i>ɫ-yáxs &quot;snow lies on the ground&quot; in Navaho became sàs &quot;corn lies on the ground&quot;. Similarly, the Navaho word for &quot;corn&quot; is nà:-dą: derived from two proto-Athabascan roots meaning &quot;enemy&quot; and &quot;food&quot;, suggesting that the Navaho originally considered corn to be &quot;food of the enemy&quot; when they first arrived among the pueblo people.<p>[0] <a href=""http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nava1243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/nava1243</a>

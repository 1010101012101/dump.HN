8676390,comment,8675952,8675952,0,0,jandrewrogers,,,"For most people, the easiest way to become financially independent is to save aggressively.<p>That aside, I have always invested in a small number of individual stocks, with minimal management or effort, and only moving positions between companies slowly over time. Basically, I make bets on long-term trends that I view as technologically inevitable. I don&#x27;t invest in sexy companies (though some become sexy later), I invest in companies that are undervalued relative to the technology trends. That strategy is pretty trivial but it has allowed me to beat the S&P index pretty consistently over decades (famous last words) with the money I don&#x27;t have a better use for e.g. savings. In fact, the margin by which I beat the S&P has been slowly improving, which I think reflects the increasing ability of tech to move the needle on the economy.<p>Since this is a tech site, this would seem like a repeatable strategy that anyone could and would use. But apparently people don&#x27;t. Of course, I could just be really lucky.",1417337939

8676385,comment,8675932,8675932,0,0,nalahal,,,"As someone with depression, personally I wouldn&#x27;t recommend mushrooms to others in a similar situation. I&#x27;ve tried them once and it was a rather uncomfortable experience. In fact, a quote from the acticle describes my experience fairly well - &quot;When suffering depression, people get stuck in a spiral of negative thoughts and cannot get out of it&quot;. This does tend to describe my thought process in general, but this was exacerbated on mushrooms. I had little control over my thought process, which made me anxious, which made the experience harder to deal with. Although, when considering certain personal issues at the time which would normally cause me anxiety, they did feel much less significant.<p>That said, I&#x27;ve heard many stories of people experiencing life changing epiphanies from mushroom trips as described in the article, and I am intrigued by articles like this and the science behind it. Perhaps my environment, or the specific mushrooms I tried made it worse. Also, having tried them once and come out the other end fine may make future experiences less uncomfortable - a large part of what made it difficult was a concern that my mental state would be permanently affected by the experience, and this was not the case. Still, it makes me less inclined to try them again until I&#x27;m in a better mental state.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, these were the variety of &quot;magic truffles&quot; which are legal and readily obtainable from high street stores in Amsterdam, but as far as I&#x27;m aware the active ingredient is the same psilocybin as other forms of magic mushrooms. I wasn&#x27;t on any medication at the time, though I have heard of certain anti-depressants and other medication either having a negative effect, or negating the effects of mushrooms entirely.",1417337719

Your book now no longer pays for itself, but rather must make at least enough to cover the cost or else it vanishes from the public eye.<p>It&#x27;s a small fee, but having been through it and seeing what the long-tail of a book can look like, it&#x27;s something that can add up and be problematic in the long run, and it also hampers the service&#x27;s utility for those who wish to offer their book free in digital.

8676365,comment,8675932,8676164,0,0,cnrsvxz,,,"There are a few non-hallucinogenic and non-sedative derivatives of ketamine being studied at the moment as antidepressants. Anecdotes of their use seem to be positive, but of course those should be taken with a grain of salt. See LongeCity&#x27;s Brain Health forum for some crazy threads relating to this.[0]<p>On another note, this summer I experimented with NSI-189[1] for depression to great effect. It&#x27;s a hippocampal neurogenic agent currently prepping for phase 2 trials. I found that its antidepressant effects over a one-month cycle were remarkably similar to my single psilocybin experience a few years back. Specifically, they both (or rather, I) exhibited two characteristics:<p>(a) &quot;Illuminating&quot; rather than the &quot;dulling&quot; of traditional antidepressants. A feeling of irrational filters being lifted from all my senses and the cognitive functions directly adjacent to them. It doesn&#x27;t feel like a band-aid like tricyclics and SSRIs do. It feels like a realization that the depression is a lie, that it doesn&#x27;t reflect the actual state of the world.<p>(b) Persistence of the effect long after the chemical was no longer in my system. Where &quot;long&quot; was approximately two years for the psilocybin, and I&#x27;m coming up on four months after cessation of the NSI-189 with not just steady benefits but continuous improvement. This matches the results found in the Phase 1b trial.[2]<p>Now I haven&#x27;t gotten an MRI to see if my hippocampus has grown to an abnormal size, like was found in an early mouse study, but my experience has made me extremely optimistic for the next ten years of antidepressant research. I&#x27;m fairly certain we&#x27;ll be able to narrow down the exact mechanisms by which psychedelics alleviate depression and isolate them from the permanent destructive potential of most psychedelics.[3]<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.longecity.org/forum/forum/169-brain-health/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.longecity.org/forum/forum/169-brain-health/</a><p>[1] It is currently not being sold, and its patent-holder Neuralstem is being quite threatening toward would-be vendors.

Common anecdotal effects include heightened taste and smell, back-of-skull pressure/ache and mild parasthesia. A couple instances of major, painful parasthesia in individuals with previous nerve damage. But no headspace, no high, no rush, no immediate feeling that you&#x27;re taking a drug at all, and the antidepressant effects do not reveal themselves for at least a week.",1417336924

My problem with this is there&#x27;s no real biosphere.<p>As far as I can tell the larger fish use the same food resource as the small fish rather than hunting small fish.<p>Ideally a biosphere this small should be something like: (food source > small fish > large fish > food source)<p>I imagine the food source would be a simple representation of algae and plankton turning light and dead material into energy.<p>There are other things that bother me about the large fish behavior but I have to go get my laundry.",1417334924

I&#x27;ve tried to do exactly that but it&#x27;s really just IMPOSSIBLE to get your planned actions done exactly on planned timeslots. In the end the whole &quot;planning&quot; unravels. GTD makes a lot of sense to me because it completely avoids the problem by detaching actionable items from specific time slots: you just do pre-specified items one by one whenever you can. It doesn&#x27;t deviate you from long-term plans at all, because you&#x27;ll put them into &quot;in&quot; list also, and then write out the step-by-step thing to do. The only slight difficulty might be with repetitive items.",1417334868

Does the overhead of creating a new CLH every time a Haskell function is invoked from C introduce any performance concerns(speed didn&#x27;t seem to be well-covered in section 6)?<p>2. How should Table 5 be interpreted? Is the main goal to show that B5 and B6 do not use the garbage collector if it&#x27;s unnecessary for the task? Not sure I understand how the event-driven mutator fits into the situation.",1417334701

Doing that research saved me making more mistakes down the road.<p>Another common mistake with pre-IPO companies is to say &quot;Wow, I get X thousand options!!&quot; But you have to ask how many outstanding shares the company has. What really matters is what percentage of the company (your shares divided by total outstanding shares) is being offered to you.",1417334669

They care first and foremost about creating a good interface for their users, and making a damn good product.

Designate some state--I offer you my home state of West Virginia--and isolate it from the current system.  Then try the craziest stuff we can think of and see what works.

Under what we currently think we know about gravity a clump compressed to that radius will wind up as a singularity, but it's <i>possible</i> that we might have something wrong about gravity which would result in black holes with event horizons but no singularities -- instead you'd just have some high-but-not-infinite density mass in the middle being prevented from collapsing by... something we currently don't understand.",1226611089

Paying GM 25B to continue to use materials and labour inefficiently, creating vehicles that won't sell, provides a reason to give their workers a salary which they'll spend in their local economy, keeping second-order collapses like those that accompany the closing of military bases in isolated areas from happening.<p>If, on the other hand, we shut down GM and put its former workers on extended unemployment, those with the aptitude and will relocate and find similar jobs; those without retrain and join the economy in a different role.  The materials that formerly went into unwanted cars will be obtainable more cheaply for other uses.<p>The point is debatable, but it seems obvious to me that even if some of the GM workers remain forever unable or unwilling to rejoin the workforce, the cost of supporting them will be lower without the inefficiency of supporting a company on top of them.<p>I've read, but cannot source at the moment, that when federal aid to farms really took off in the 1930s, they did the math and realized welfare to individuals would be cheaper.

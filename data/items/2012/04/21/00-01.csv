One thing I really like about your mock-up is that the link to the comments page has a much bigger click target. I lost count of the times I wanted to open the comments page but missed the target by a couple of pixels because it's so darn small (only 7pt).<p>If I were you, I'd drop the leftmost number (1, 2, 3 ... 20) which looks totally useless to me. I'd also move the points number right below the upvote button so that everyone can immediately tell what it is. No need to repeat ""Points"" 20 times in every page.<p>Also, screenshots like this should be in PNG, not JPG.",1334969980

3870438,comment,3870321,3870321,10,0,astral303,,,"Sorry, but I don't like it. I do like the top header and the color scheme in general. The texture in the header looks snazzy, in a good way.<p>The space wasted by the listing of stories is very excessive. That's the meat and potatoes of the site, yet I see 10 stories in the first screenfold vs 24 now. Why dedicate so much space to the wide ""XX points"" label? Is it even clickable (why would it be?) Arguably upvoting a story is more important and is actually actionable, yet the up vote ""caret"" looks way less clickable.  The comment count balloons are jarring in their size and contrast and their random placement on the right side is distracting. When I glance at the page, I notice this jagged curve of gray dots, yet it delivers no useful information (other than how long the headline is, which is not useful).<p>So I think it's all about the spacing. When I look at that page, is the headline list easily perusable end parsable? I don't think it is. It is more spaced out than the current design, but it is surrounded and squeezed by these loud new elements. Think about the negative space created by the three new columns before the headline--I think clutters up the headline list.<p>Compared to the current design, this is a worse design. While the current HN design could use improvement (IMO text is too tiny), it does have a striking simplicity and focus on headlines that I love.<p>I apologize if I come off sounding harsh, and I certainly don't have design chops myself to pull off something like that (though I'd like to at some point in the future...)",1334969536

The 'blurred' examples show the font broadening through the 'blur', which is why thinner fonts work well here, but is there a scientific basis for this? I would assume that this is good for light text on a dark background. For the opposite, I'd assume a thicker font would do better (text would become 'thinner' as your eyes blur?).

My first thought was this means you only would check my server 6 times a month, so on average it would take 2.5 days for you to notice a problem and tell me. That can't be right, so I must conclude I have no idea what a ""check"" is. Does it mean 6 pages or things at my site are monitored?

Even if you select <i>just the hostname</i> of a non-ssl site, it <i>still</i> prefixes the `<a href=""http://`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://`</a>. This is a constant irritant when I try ssh'ing to a host or pasting a hostname to someone/something that only wants the hostname.<p>2) It displays some prefixes (https) but not others (http). I would prefer to be shown all prefixes. There was even talk of hiding https prefix for a while as I recall.<p>3) Location bar history completion always seems to show me the worse possible result. It often omits things that I want, and I find no way to complete to them. Sometimes it shows the result only if it type the full url.<p>4) Choices that make sense if you are trying to make the browser an OS, by ignoring OS functionality -- native printing dialogs/previews, native dns caches, tabs (custom window management), task managers, etc. Not all of them are choices I like (printing, custom dns cache).

But once a government starts to interfere with debasing the money by law until it has no intrinsic value anymore, and keep printing it (so the same amount of goods & services are chased by more and more currency units), you can't have actual price information anymore.

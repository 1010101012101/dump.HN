But then again, for people with actual skill nothing has really changed throughout the last 25 years, despite the crisis.<p>Yes, there was a huge market through Y2K and the dot-com bubble for people who knew how to operate a keyboard, and that market collapsed. But those people where as much developers as I am a surgeon because I know how to apply a band-aid. Personally I was glad the bubble burst, because it became increasingly harder to avoid landing in a place where most of the &quot;developers&quot; weren&#x27;t utterly incompetent.<p>HN isn&#x27;t a representative audience though. Most of those people wouldn&#x27;t be on the early 2000&#x27;s equivalents of HN either. If this is a bubble and it bursts, most of HN-ers that get affected won&#x27;t be out of work for more than a month.<p>Many may have to take a boring enterprise gig, but that&#x27;s pretty much how the second wave of internet-companies started: bored and with time on their hands, many hackers started to work on what was then called &quot;social software&quot; projects, which eventually resulted in a wave of social media startups.<p>Things may be different in SV, especially when it comes to the balance of wages vs cost of living, but SV is an outlier.",1419234845

I&#x27;m implying that people heavily invested in bitcoin tend to use vanity metrics like this.<p>That said the things I look at that make me believe bitcoin is stagnating/declining are things like the continued slide of the price over the year, Bitcoin Black Friday 2014 being a huge failure, Overstock missing their bitcoin sales expectations by 17 million dollars.  Basically every vendor I&#x27;ve seen comment on sales has said there have been pretty much none this year.  The fact that 2014 was meant to be the year of bitcoin and there has been no breakout in the general public.  Everyone seems vaguely aware of bitcoin but no one is investing any time in learning anything about it because it solves problems that most people don&#x27;t care about(freedom) and creates problems they do(security).<p>Now I just see people in the community rallying around remittance and the killer app that will save bitcoin but the actual transfer of funds isn&#x27;t the expensive part of remittance the compliance around the transfer of funds is and the existing services that do remittance cheaper using bitcoin only work now because they are ignoring compliance completely.

When I got it down to 50% a recruiter called me back and got me something.<p>> Did recruiters simply cease to exist?<p>All the opportunistic, bad recruiters crawled back to whatever hole they came from. Same with all the unqualified &quot;bandwagon programmers&quot; who cashed on the bubble and gave all of us a bad reputation forcing hiring managers into brutal interviewing processes.<p>Recruiters were let go too, agencies closed or downsized. A few good ones remained.<p>> More to the point, what advice do you have for developers who want to be well-insulated if/when the next crash happens?<p>Well first, you got to have some sort of financial cushion and a plan to cut down expenses to the bone: the day I was laid of on 2001 I canceled my phone, cable, any other superfluous monthly expense. Also moved to smaller apartment as soon as I could. I knew it was going to be rough for a while.<p>Next is to know which industry to aim for: after 9/11 lots of money flowed to military contractors so I started aiming for that industry. I ended up programming for a company that provided services for the military until the market recovered.",1419233185

Angular turned out to the easiest by far to get work done with exposure to some advanced concepts - Backbone&#x27;s documentation was very confusing since everything was in a flat list with high level details buried in there & not enough explanation, and Ember&#x27;s templating system was very rigid and highly dependent on build processes for someone who had no experience working with tools such as grunt or gulp at the time.<p>React is probably the best candidate to achieve that simplicity along with Angular, although I would give Angular the edge, simply because it does not rely on tooling to build a small app and still benefits just as well from it when it is present.  The documentation, even two years ago, was better than Backbone&#x27;s at the time (and as far as I can tell from a recent study of Backbone, still is) - Ember&#x27;s might have been a little better, but it also threw more stuff at you upfront.<p>The expert can probably work with all of these frameworks just fine - in the end, finding what framework (or no framework) jives with you is the best for your long term development.

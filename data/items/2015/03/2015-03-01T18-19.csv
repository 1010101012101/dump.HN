He seems to have had enough resolve to turn himself around but it baffles me how someone like that could be expected to be a &quot;scholar athlete&quot; when they are incapable of college level scholarship. It also speaks to the failure of secondary education that high schools will issue diplomas to unprepared students solely to keep their graduation rates up.",1425236333

It&#x27;s a pervasive attitude as of late that &quot;users are stupid; so kill all the options for choice&quot; and &quot;older = worse; newer = better&quot;<p>Think of it like learning Dvorak. Sure, in theory, by some arbitrary histrionics, these new UIs are 3% more &quot;effective&quot;. There&#x27;s no real objective proof of it, but people just feel like it is. And hell, maybe it really is! So to gain that 3% advantage, they want you to throw out 20 years of muscle memory and familiarity. They want you to throw away all that you&#x27;re used to and retrain yourself again and again. And sure, maybe after enough time, you might actually like it a little bit more. But all of the time you&#x27;ve wasted relearning everything will <i>never</i> make up for the tiny, marginal increase in efficiency you gained. Nor for all you had to give up to get there.<p>But this attitude of eternal improvement never ends. You jump on Dvorak because it&#x27;s such an improvement, and you spend months, maybe years, getting up to your native speed again ... and along comes Colemak, but now it has competition with Workman. Which do you choose? Colemak or Workman? Gnome 3 or Unity? Gotta throw away that Qwerty and Dvorak mechanical keyboard; gotta throw away all those old GTK2 UIs; and start over.<p>The infinitesimal, unscientific usability enhancements are so subjective as to be irrelevant. Change certainly favors the young, and is hardest on the older generations; but true positive change has historically been accomplished incrementally through evolution (Windows 3.1 - XP, parts of 7). Yet nowadays, it&#x27;s trying for revolution. Choice is no longer en vogue. And this attitude is ... pervasive. And that is absolutely terrifying.",1425236270

I could watch it every day and never get tired of it. Funny thing was that our local cable network showed the &quot;extended version&quot; (with the sentry turrets, scenes with Newt&#x27;s parents, etc) and for years I thought I&#x27;d imagined some of those scenes because the extended version wasn&#x27;t available on video until much later.<p>Fun fact: Jenette Goldstein (Pvt. Vasquez) runs several bra stores in the Los Angeles area that cater to women with difficult-to-fit sizes. She is a total sweetheart. If you have a small group and contact her via email ahead of time she may be willing to make accommodations for your group. We had about four couples and she opened the store a bit early for our group. The women got fitting sessions (she personally fitted my wife) and she chatted with us for a bit afterward, including answering some questions about <i>Aliens.</i><p>Please be respectful of her time and the fact that she&#x27;s running a business, obviously. The bras are fairly expensive (but worth it, according to the women in our group) and they don&#x27;t carry anything smaller than a D cup.

Sure, you can use unsafe manual memory management to work around it, but without RAII and a library designed for manual memory management you suffer a huge penalty in usability—not to mention the safety problems. I can foresee people easily ending up in a situation whereby they can&#x27;t multithread their applications because they started out using the GC and would have to rewrite all their code to switch from automatic memory management to unsafe manual memory management.<p>Another way to work around the restriction is to copy the data, but that usually ends up making your parallel algorithm slower than sequential unless it has very high arithmetic intensity.

But the reason I&#x27;m becoming terrified and outspoken is because the design that was <i>ubiquitous</i> for the last two decades has, in the past 2-3 years, become so obscure that I now find myself running FreeBSD (a niche of Linux, which is itself a niche of Windows) with Xfce (a niche of Xorg WMs) ... and they&#x27;re both my last-resort options to run a traditional desktop. Yes, it&#x27;s choice, but ... man.<p>Everybody else has decided that everything must change drastically, and even worse ... said change is completely different everywhere. The days of installing the OSS packages (Firefox, Pidgin, Transmission, mplayer, etc) and using Windows, OS X or Linux almost the same are over. Native-looking cross-platform applications become more impossible with each passing day. The ones that remain do so by using the old paradigm anyway (Pidgin, Transmission, old Firefox, etc) or simply doing their own CSD rendering entirely (Chrome, Chromrefox, etc)<p>Even for those who like the changes to their specific environment, I&#x27;d caution you ... if they so freely changed things with no choice before, nothing is stopping them from doing it again in the near future. You should never be <i>too</i> supportive of radical, forced change; for one day it might not be the change you wanted.",1425235291

However, you&#x27;re addressing something I didn&#x27;t say.  I wasn&#x27;t accusing elite universities of dumbing down <i>existing</i> standards.  I was talking about about how the universities <i>would</i> hypothetically have to lower the academic thresholds to fulfill someone&#x27;s idea that 13% of Ivy Leagues should be black to mirror the 13% in the general population.<p>>, it was about stacking athletic teams.<p>Right.  But, what&#x27;s the reason-behind-the-reason that it gets framed as &quot;stacking athletes&quot; so that it looks like it has nothing to do with academics?<p>In reality, it&#x27;s the academics (or fiction of it) that made it a scandal in the first place.<p>Let&#x27;s remember that it&#x27;s a football <i>scholar</i>ship.  It&#x27;s supposed to be <i>scholars</i> who go to school and happen to use football participation to pay for tuition.  For many reasons (societal, circuses & bread, etc), it has mutated into athletes who need to fake the <i>academic</i> process to play for the school.  Since society has not embraced an alternative structure for 19-year olds to play televised minor-league football outside of college institutions, that&#x27;s how academics got twisted to fit a non-educational agenda.  Football isn&#x27;t getting in the way of school; it&#x27;s school that is getting in the way of football.<p>As for making the black percentages at ivy leagues match the population at large, I&#x27;m not exactly sure what the other posters who dismiss SAT + GPA + AP course transcripts are proposing.  If elite schools are academic institutions (instead of unpaid football teams), and SAT+GPA+AP classes are cultural discrimination, what do they propose the schools look at?  The color of the skin?     If football doesn&#x27;t have much to do with <i>academic</i> qualifications, the amount of pigment in the skin doesn&#x27;t either.<p>You&#x27;re black -- <i>and</i> you got into MIT.

I&#x27;d say about half the places I interviewed at basically said that they weren&#x27;t expecting me to dress up and I wore a nicer everyday outfit.<p>If the company doesn&#x27;t give you guidance, I think it&#x27;s easiest to ask.  Usually you&#x27;re dealing with a recruiter at the company and they want to get someone good hired, but ultimately the choice to hire won&#x27;t be theirs.  They&#x27;re not going to want you to get a &quot;no&quot; decision simply because someone interviewing you didn&#x27;t like your dress.  They know the people who will be interviewing you and what they&#x27;re expecting.  If the company keeps track of numbers for these inside recruiters, those recruiters are going to want to look like they&#x27;re bringing in good people - that they have good judgement when bringing people in for interviews.  They won&#x27;t want their numbers to be bad based on your dress - based on a technicality.  How crummy would that be - your numbers are worse than another recruiter&#x27;s because you wouldn&#x27;t advise candidates on how to dress and they were denied because of that?<p>You can always fall back to being more dressy, but I think asking is the easiest.",1425234824

As mentioned elsewhere in these comments, code injection should use caves and jumps, not overwrite existing code.<p>With a memory-based bot you often do not even need to write to the game&#x27;s memory. You can use the ReadProcessMemory API call for data gathering and perform inputs with SendInput (emulate keyboard input with LLKHF_INJECTED set) or PostMessage (no LLKHF_INJECTED, also works in backgrounded windows).<p>The disadvantage to memory bots is that they&#x27;re often more complicated at scale (beyond the point where a pixel bot would likely fail entirely), particularly with games which are updated. In cases where a game client is updated, signatures similar to virus definitions can be provided to find the particular memory address of a sought value regardless of version. By scanning the application&#x27;s source code for a unique bytecode pattern known to contain the target address, you can then extract the address and read the value. This is commonly known as signature or pattern scanning.<p>There is another variant of bots for client/server programs where a &quot;headless&quot; (no display) client can interact with the server via network communication alone. Not as much fun to watch but also a very effective way of interacting with games, though it does not apply to standalone clients like this one.",1425234230

Usually, this is because I am taking time off for the interview, either coming directly from my existing job, or going directly there after the interview.<p>I do not comment on attire during the interview, not my own, nor anyone else&#x27;s.  If I am asked about it, I say &quot;This is what I wear to work.  Does your company have a dress code?&quot;  Regardless of the answer, this is a warning signal, and my salary expectation just jumped.  The interviewer permanently lost its potential discount for work environment.<p>I may even keep my existing employee ID on its neck band and tucked inside my shirt pocket, to reinforce the signal that I already have a job (and you&#x27;re keeping me from it).<p>When I interview while unemployed, I&#x27;m far more likely to wear the suit.

Well-researched, tested strategies are thrown out because they&#x27;re not profitable enough to the senior management.

I have no need for Python but so many people are seemingly trying to coax me to use it.  Such is the case for most of the verbose languages.<p>I do not understand all the constant discourse about languages.  Personally I prefer to choose something simple and small, and stick to it.  To increase convenience when working with these terse languages, I write code generators.<p>To me, it is not the language that matters (except as below), it is the programs that the author chooses to write and how those programs perform.<p>It is probably my own selective bias but I find that the smaller programs written in relatively terse languages tend to be of higher quality.  When I see a verbose language used to write a program, I am reluctant to use the program.  But I would never suggest that someone else make the same decisions.  I believe one should think for herself.<p>There is not so much discussion about the terse languages I use.  I am inclined to think this is a good thing.  Then  I can focus on the choice of the programs the author chooses to write instead of her choice of language.",1425234072

I might link to this in my blog since I independently came up with the same argument.<p>In this case, I think one version of &quot;privilege&quot; is the idea that our society involves <i>unipolar</i> power relations where one group/ideology is privileged and enjoys special advantages.  Individual <i>people</i> might in some ways align with this group/ideologies, and in other ways not (this is called &quot;intersectionality&quot;).  But when they do align with this group/ideology they receive some of its benefits.<p>Sago&#x27;s version is that privilege is just another word for any group having any advantage for any reason.  I.e. &quot;privilege&quot; stripped of its underlying assumptions about societies power structure.  It&#x27;s unfortunate that Sago feel so strongly that they represent sociological research, when I think that almost all sociologists use the other definition.<p>Sago says that Asians might be privileged simply because their culture [0].  The orthodox view would be that Asians only receive <i>White</i> privilege, by their willingness to accept both the White lifestyle, working under a capitalist system, and adopt White views on Black/White race relations.  To the extend that Asians also study harder, that would be an accident of history, and probably something an orthodox sociologist would try to downplay (e.g. by looking at Nth generation Asians).<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9126189"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9126189</a>",1425233135

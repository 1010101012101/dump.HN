8216390,comment,8214438,8214636,1,0,Zigurd,,,"While I&#x27;m sure people will have many excuses, I think you are right. $200M+ for a health insurance portal that includes zero novel technologies, algorithms, or other sources of fundamental technology uncertainty, never mind actual risk, has room for multiple crimes of fraud, bribery, and other malfeasance. There are multiple comparable projects against which to measure this one and find the outlier events.<p>All that said, a successful lawsuit and even criminal prosecutions won&#x27;t make a significant sent in similar future cases. Governments have got to start acting like a large, collaborative, transparent monopsony, and to demand that vendors draw on and contribute to a pool of open source software, and to form consortia to audit and maintain that pool. That would be a huge benefit to the technology industry, and to taxpayers.",1408816795
8216389,comment,8214515,8215423,1,0,CamperBob2,,,"MSX is a band-aid to cover up low resolution IR.  With 80x60 IR, MSX is a useful feature, because without it you often can&#x27;t tell what you&#x27;re looking at.  But with 320x240 IR it&#x27;s not needed in most cases.  Worse, because the IR and visual lenses aren&#x27;t coaxial, the resulting parallax error tends to actively deceive you about the exact location of small hot spots.<p>If FLIR didn&#x27;t go out of their way to cripple the 320x240 sensors in their low-end models, MSX wouldn&#x27;t be worth incorporating at all.",1408816780

It&#x27;s no more a generalization than saying Thais like spicy food.<p>The irony here is at level: ridiculous. Have you ever met any Thai people and actually spoken to them?<p>Let me make it crystal clear in case you can&#x27;t work it out:<p>Not every Thai is a bad driver<p>Not every Thai flaunts laws/rules<p>Not every Thai enjoys or can even eat spicy food<p>Not every Thai is just a poor brown girl/boy waiting for a &quot;rich&quot; white prince to make her/his life better.",1408816777

Of course it&#x27;s terrible when large sites go offline and take vast swaths of the Internet with them, and we should continue to shame the ones that do it.  At the same time, if something is really important to you, you shouldn&#x27;t store it in the form of links to random third-party servers.<p>One problem we need to solve as coders is giving people better tools for saving stuff.  It&#x27;s really hard right now to save a webpage (or worse, series of connected pages) with any confidence that you&#x27;ve captured everything you need to see it again if the original server disappears.<p>A project that I think has struck a really good balance between permanence and retaining authors&#x27; control over their writing is the Archive of Our Own (AO3).  A bunch of fanfic authors got tired of sites falling out from under them, and decided to implement their own system, along with sensible governance and a way to fund its ongoing operations.

Telling a smart child they are smart is honest and kind and humane.  I believe that in the long run the attitudes toward honesty and humility and empathy are the most important things I instill as a parent.<p>Some things are easy for smart people and not acknowledging that as a factor in my child&#x27;s successes would be dishonest when discussing those successes. It is akin to not acknowledging that a pitcher of cold Kool-Aid is not the product of economic circumstance.<p>Some success is comes from pure good fortune, some comes from just showing up, and some comes from hard work. Talking honestly about when and how each plays a role is my job as a parent.  I hope my child develops the ability to distinguish challenge from a checklist of busy work.<p>It&#x27;s not either or. A child can understand that some successes come because the task is easy for them. Others will come from hard work. The can tell the difference between watching an addition video and earning an orange belt.<p>That said, my standard for good parenting is forgiving. Just trying to do a better job than one&#x27;s own parents is hard enough. My parenting advice, for what it&#x27;s worth, is to treat children as antonymous moral agents, fully capable of making intelligent decisions and able to learn from mistakes. Talk with them honestly as such and avoid deceit even when they are small.<p>Because that is when the foundation for their life as a teenager and adult is laid.",1408815267

I see others on my team struggling with these very basic on-boarding issues, that I think aren&#x27;t perhaps obvious when you&#x27;re so embedded in the Linux mindset.<p>You should absolutely think of your software, even though it&#x27;s free, as having a conversion funnel to happy users. You are competing both against established players like Chef and Puppet, as well as new up and comers like Salt. Once a potential user reaches ansible.com, at every single step of the on-boarding that follows you will have some % of attrition to your competitors and apathy. The more steps, the larger the attrition, the smaller your userbase is.<p>Think of it this way; if you add a new feature, you may gain some small percentage of users. But if you reduce the on-boarding attrition rate from 30% to, 1-2%, you will gain a simply massive amount of users over time. Do you know or track your conversion rate?<p>The best docs is no docs. When curious Mac user visits <a href=""http://www.vagrantup.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vagrantup.com/</a> they see the download button, they click the Mac installer, and they&#x27;re done. At no point during the on-boarding does installing the software require even seeing the docs. Mac users and even devs expect DMGs these days. Everything from &#x27;git&#x27;, to &#x27;vagrant&#x27;, come in DMGs. On most sites (like git), you visit the front page and it autodetects you are on Mac and gives you the DMG, which every Mac user will immediately know how to use. Git comes installed by default in Macs these days. Most people on Mac never need to install git anymore. <i>The DMG file for git on Mac has 11,000+ weekly downloads</i> on git-scm.com (that&#x27;s in addition to the brews and ports of the world, which I would imagine have less users). How would you like an extra 11K downloads a week? ;)<p>The tide has definitely turned in favor of Macs over the last 3 years in software shops, I see more and more developers using Macs exclusively for development. In my company, although all software gets deployed to Linux (on AWS), of the several hundred devs working on the software I would be surprised if more than a handful (like me) still use Linux on their development machines (deploying to Vagrant locally and the like). While many of the Mac converts are coming from Linux, most new devs are just given a MacBook Pro from day one. In this new reality, I fear that you are doing yourself a big disservice by trying to shoehorn the Linux software distribution models on the new Mac users.",1408813795

8216254,comment,8211614,8213243,1,0,anon1385,,,"That is not how to use temperature anomalies. The entire point of using anomalies rather than the raw data is to get around the fact that the various data sets are not calibrated against each other. Picking a broad baseline avoids having to worry about distortion in the graph due to the arbitrary starting point. The individual records will be different for any given year, because of error and because they are not always measuring the same thing anyway (HADCRUT4 is surface temperature, UAH is troposphere).<p>The fact that the CMIP5 mean and UAH have nearly the same anomaly value in 1983 when using a 1979-1983 baseline is just coincidental. They diverge quite a bit in several of the other years in the 1979-83 period. Roy crops his graph to hide that and make it look like they begin together. So he hasn&#x27;t even done what you claim (aligned the trends to match at the very beginning of the satellite record) because his method puts the CMIP5 mean anomaly about 0.2 of a degree above UAH at the beginning of the satellite record. Plotting all the available data would show that. Hiding data just deceives the reader.<p>If he really wanted to just &quot;match at the very beginning of the satellite record&quot; as you suggest, why not just use a baseline of 1979? I suspect the answer to that is that it wouldn&#x27;t support his argument to present the data that way.<p>Your idea of aligning to the beginning of the satellite record is ill conceived anyway. That would only make sense if GCMs took the temperature data at that time as their starting point. They don&#x27;t.",1408813466

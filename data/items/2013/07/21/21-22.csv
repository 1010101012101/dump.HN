In other words, you&#x27;re part of the problem of gridlock because you&#x27;re too busy playing a gotcha game. This comes from spending too much time on blogs and forums specific to your team. Both sides do it, and I don&#x27;t understand how one could consider themselves a member of either one and pretend that they know they chose correctly.<p>Liberal Democrats are hypocrites because they spent eight years bashing George W. Bush for his expanding surveillance state--and Obama specifically spoke out against it during his candidacy--yet many of those same liberal Democrats spend their time in Washington defending the current administration&#x27;s policies.  They hated Bush&#x27;s wars and detainment policies yet say nothing about Obama&#x27;s continuation of them, the drone strikes, and the general warmongering. This administration has been one long series of broken promises and defensive Democrats. Watching Nancy Pelosi attempt to differentiate between Obama&#x27;s security state and Bush&#x27;s security state was mind-boggling.<p>If you&#x27;re going to respond that liberals are opposed to all this and don&#x27;t consider Obama a true liberal because of it, conservatives did the same regarding George W. Bush when his poll numbers went down too. Every time there&#x27;s a problem, the person in office suddenly doesn&#x27;t represent you anymore, and you distance yourselves.<p>Bloating the spectrum of government power refers to  desensitization to the growing power the government has to collect information on citizens for its own purposes, from the healthcare database to monitoring phone calls.<p>I can tell which &quot;side&quot; you&#x27;re on just from the seething way you talk about the other team. If you took a step back and looked objectively, you&#x27;d see that you both come off the same way to independents and have the same transgressions and hypocrisies.",1374443738

Self improvement groups do not create the kind of bonds in a community that will cause people to make real sacrifices for their neighbors.</i><p>1. A sense that we share an on-going narrative can give rise to a shared sense of purpose or mission. That in turn can be a significant motivator of communal behavior, even in ordinary life.<p>(EXAMPLES:  + The founding of the modern state of Israel [many founders were secular or even atheistic]. + American exceptionalism and &quot;manifest destiny.&quot; + Tradition in, e.g., military units and sports teams. + Scientific teams in pursuit of a discovery.)<p>2.  QUESTION:  Do we share any non-religious on-going narrative that can <i>scalably</i> and <i>sustainably</i> generate a sense of shared purpose or mission?  Certainly different individuals are motivated by different things.  Here&#x27;s what sort of does it for me:  It&#x27;s plausible that we&#x27;re all participating in a cosmic construction project that&#x27;s been in progress for at least the past 13.8 billion years. In the words of an old story, we aren&#x27;t just cutting stone to pay the bills, we&#x27;re building a cathedral [0]. We can&#x27;t know what the final outcome of the construction project will be, but if past trends are any indication, it&#x27;ll be amazing.  To me, that&#x27;s pretty exciting.<p>[0] Self-cite: <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/06/metanarratives_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/06/metanarratives_....</a> and <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/09/creation_a_tita.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/09/creation_a_tita....</a> and <a href=""http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/03/progress_hope_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.questioningchristian.com/2006/03/progress_hope_a....</a>",1374443710

6080491,comment,6078575,6080234,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"<p><pre><code>    American Psychological Association, 2003\n    http://www.apa.org/monitor/feb03/intelligence.aspx\n</code></pre>\n&quot;People in Western cultures, he suggests, tend to view intelligence as a means for individuals to devise categories and to engage in rational debate, while people in Eastern cultures see it as a way for members of a community to recognize contradiction and complexity and to play their social roles successfully.&quot;<p>&quot;Over the past several years, Sternberg and Grigorenko also have investigated concepts of intelligence in Africa. Among the Luo people in rural Kenya, Grigorenko and her collaborators have found that ideas about intelligence consist of four broad concepts: rieko, which largely corresponds to the Western idea of academic intelligence, but also includes specific skills; luoro, which includes social qualities like respect, responsibility and consideration; paro, or practical thinking; and winjo, or comprehension. Only one of the four--rieko--is correlated with traditional Western measures of intelligence.&quot;<p>&quot;They also agree with studies in a number of countries, both industrialized and nonindustrialized, that suggest that people who are unable to solve complex problems in the abstract can often solve them when they are presented in a familiar context.&quot;<p>&quot;Many psychologists believe that the idea that a test can be completely absent of cultural bias--a recurrent hope of test developers in the 20th century--is contradicted by the weight of the evidence. Raven&#x27;s Progressive Matrices, for example, is one of several nonverbal intelligence tests that were originally advertised as &quot;culture free,&quot; but are now recognized as culturally loaded.&quot;<p><pre><code>    ScienceDaily, 2010\n    http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/01/100121155220.htm\n</code></pre>\n&quot;The researchers also claim that African IQ test scores cannot be interpreted in terms of lower intelligence levels, as these scores have different psychometric characteristics than western IQ test scores. Until now, the incomparability of Western and African IQ scores had never been systematically proven.&quot;<p><pre><code>    University of North Carolina, current curriculum\n    http://www.unc.edu/~rooney/iq.htm\n</code></pre>\n&quot;In school settings, psychologists often joke that IQ is what IQ tests measure. There is a lot of truth to this adage. Ideally, IQ tests sample a wide range of experiences and they measure a persons ability to apply learned information in new and different ways. They do not measure capacity or potential. They do provide information about cognitive skills at a given point in time.<p>Because IQ tests chiefly measure success in school, they are value-laden. Scores provide a statistical indication of the extent to which a person has critical schools and information, but they should not be directly equated with intelligence. Test scores are a useful index of ability, but they may reflect test-taking sophistication, personality, and attitudinal characteristics as well as learned and innate ability (Plomin, 1989).&quot;<p><pre><code>    Further Evidence That IQ Does Not Measure Intelligence\n    http://io9.com/5959058/further-evidence-that-iq-does-not-measure-intelligence\n</code></pre>\n&quot;But some thinkers cling to the idea that IQ measures an inborn intelligence that transcends culture and schooling. If that&#x27;s true, one would expect that the most abstract, &quot;culture free&quot; elements of IQ testing wouldn&#x27;t be subject to the Flynn Effect. But they are.&quot;<p>&quot;In modern cultures, more emphasis is being placed on abstraction. Students learn algebra at an earlier age than they used to, for instance, but in addition our everyday lives are full of abstractions.&quot;<p><pre><code>    The Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition, UCSD\n    http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Paper/Cole/iq.html\n</code></pre>\n&quot;This point was made very explicitly by a Kpelle anthropological acquaintance of mine who was versed in the more esoteric aspects of Kpelle secret societies and medicine (or magic, according to American stereotypes). We had been talking about what it means to be intelligent in Kpelle society (the most appropriate term is translated as &quot;clever&quot;). &quot;Can you be a clever farmer?&quot; I asked. &quot;No,&quot; came the reply. &quot;You can be a hardworking farmer, or you can be a lucky farmer, but we couldn&#x27;t say that someone is a clever farmer. Everyone knows how to farm. We use &#x27;clever&#x27; when we talk about the way someone gets other people to help him. Some people always win arguments. Some people know how to deal with strangers. Some people know powerful medicine. These are the things we talk about as clever.&quot;&quot;<p><pre><code>    Poverty Lowers IQ\n    http://www.monitor.net/monitor/5-5-96/povertyiq.html\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Adjustments for socioeconomic conditions almost completely eliminate differences in IQ scores between black and white children, according to the study&#x27;s co-investigators.&quot;<p>&quot;&quot;The study strongly suggests that economic and learning environments of the home are the most powerful predictors of racial IQ differences in 5-year-olds,&quot; said Brooks-Gunn.&quot;<p><pre><code>    Book Review\n    http://bryanappleyard.com/flynns-iq/\n</code></pre>\n&quot;Human potential at birth is unchanged; we are not, in any fundamental sense, becoming a smarter species. But the way we live has changed. IQ tests were first established in the 19th century at a time when daily life was concrete and practical. The tests, however, had to be abstract to make them culturally neutral. People, therefore, found them harder because they were unaccustomed to such modes of thought.&quot;<p>&quot;People became better at IQ tests and, steadily, the scores rose. So IQ scores are meaningless unless their date and social norms are taken into account.&quot;<p>(Note that this is a review of a book authored by James R Flynn, the discoverer of the Flynn Effect in IQ measurements.

Or, you could strike up a conversation with HN user tokenadult, who is knowledgeable on the subject.<p>Either way, IQ tests are readily accepted now <i>not</i> to be a test for cognitive ability, and more researchers are adopting the view that it is impossible to separate cultural and environmental influences (and thus <i>knowledge</i>) from any other innate factors in IQ tests.<p>You really shouldn&#x27;t assume that the people you&#x27;re talking to don&#x27;t know what they mean.",1374443518

We at the beginning of this paradigm shift to massively multi-core CPUs. Both the tools and the theory are still in their infancy. In HW there are many promising advances being explored, such as GPUs, Intel Phi, new FPGA, and projects like Parallella.<p>The software side also requires new tools to drive these new technologies. I think traditional threading will be viewed as a stopgap hack and will be replaced by some form of functional, flow-Based, and/or reactive programming models.<p>A few years ago, I had to help our EEs write some testing software in LabVIEW. I was blow away by how elegantly it solves concurrency and fault tolerance to bad input data. It took no extra design to utilize multiprocessing and multithreading hardware. The synchronous model in our program eliminated the issue of deadlock and race conditions problems that come up when using asynchronous threads.<p>Another project with great potential is NoFlo. What SW solutions have others run into in this field?",1374442825

Personally, I think this is an interesting philosophical discussion.)<p>I disagree (with you, not with Schneier, whom I do not believe was making quite the same point you are): even though the jar verification algorithm is quite arguably horribly complex (in a way that is likely to lead to implementation skew), if Android used one or the other algorithm for managing the contents of a zip file, there would not have a been a problem: there was nothing intrinsically wrong with their signature checker, it simply didn&#x27;t work identically the same to the code that later extracted files.<p>To demonstrate why I believe this, I actually have another story to tell about signature verification vulnerabilities on this platform: Android also uses zip files for OTA system software image updates, and they actually do whole-file signatures for those archives; yet, they also managed to do it wrong, and there was a similar signature vulnerability issue that targeted the recovery system. This is the exploit used in 2009 to root the Motorola Droid.<p><a href=""http://evancharlton.com/thoughts/how-droid-was-rooted"" rel=""nofollow"">http://evancharlton.com/thoughts/how-droid-was-rooted</a><p>The cause? Once again, multiple implementations: in this case, of the system for finding the signature itself, which was attached to the end of the zip file (conceptually a zip file &quot;comment&quot;, as they wanted to use a separate off-the-shelf implementation of unzip); the implementation of unzip was using the normal &quot;scan backwards&quot; algorithm, while the verification code took the length of the signature and subtracted it from the length of the file. This caused the unzip code to use a different whole-file than the signature verification did.<p>You really can&#x27;t implement a signature system and feel safe that you did it right if the code that is using the file is different than the code that is verifying the file: that&#x27;s the core issue that is behind this kind of vulnerability. It&#x27;s a sloppy kind of mistake, and these &quot;multiple implementation&quot; situations are always the first place to look for bugs as you attack a system: maybe the bootloader has a one-off read-only implementation of the filesystem parser, or maybe the kernel has a different implementation of XML (such as to parse Apple plist files) than userland.<p>You might argue that it is easier to have multiple implementations that are more likely to be implemented in the same way if the specification is simpler, but that is a mitigation, not a solution: at some point, the file is always going to be in some kind of container (such as on the filesystem, or in a flash memory partition, or in a MIME-encoded e-mail message, or yes: inside of a zip file) and if the implementation of the code that works with that content is different in one place than in the other place, that is how this kind of mistake is made.<p>While complex, jarsign has been around a long time and is fairly battle-hardened: attackers have had well over a decade to find holes in its specification, and it has been used in some rather security-critical deployed-over-insecure-Internet situations; the only reason we&#x27;d expect to find a mistake today is because the implementation was wrong. As an example, we might expect to find &quot;extra files are allowed in the zip file that were not signed&quot; (the kind of mistake that at least was, if not still is, made by Apple&#x27;s codesign implementation).<p>To be clear: yes, you should strive to use as whole-file verification techniques as possible. (I am not disagreeing with Scheier&#x27;s point: in fact, I agree with him whole-heartedly, I just believe that &quot;whole-file&quot; is not the root cause of this particular mistake that Google made with jarsign.) I was, truly, very disappointed that the APK algorihthm was not a whole-file signature verification, especially given that the tool that does the whole-file OTA update signatures is &quot;SignApk&quot; (like, I thought they were using the same signature in both places).<p>However, in this case, the signature mechanism  was implemented correctly on top of the Java ZipFile abstraction: the problem is that that underlying abstraction was incompatible with Dalvik&#x27;s, and that kind of problem can happen even to &quot;whole-file&quot; solutions. The underlying philosophical issue is that, much like &quot;you can&#x27;t not choose partition tolerance&quot;, you can&#x27;t not have a container: we aren&#x27;t signing the whole filesystem, we are signing one file on the filesystem, and somewhere there will be code that decides which file is being signed by what signature.<p>(I&#x27;d even argue that we are in &quot;screaming agreement&quot; at some level: in essence, I feel that the only way to truly know you have &quot;signed the thing you meant, not the thing you said&quot;--which requires feeling comfortable that the interpretation of the meaning in all of the places that you attempt to understand that meaning is the same--is to have one single implementation in charge of meaning extraction. In real-world encryption systems, you will always have a container: to be responsible, you have to not subject that container to sloppy implementation skew.)",1374441697

A plus side of such a precedent is that it might strengthen the position of journalists asserting a 5th-amendment right not to testify (assuming the government doesn&#x27;t grant immunity up front). Conspiracy is so broad that <i>anything</i> they say about their relationship with the person in question could potentially be used against them, giving a good basis for invoking the 5th.<p>On principle, though, it seems journalists typically wish not to appear as witnesses at all, which makes it harder for them to use that approach. Except in limited circumstances, like choosing not to appear as a witness in your own criminal trial, the 5th amendment doesn&#x27;t protect failure to appear; to invoke it you&#x27;d have to show up on the witness stand and then refuse to answer questions whose answer you felt might be self-incriminating. Of course, you could blanket do that to <i>every</i> question except bare factual ones that ask for your name and the like. But you&#x27;d still have to show up, and on principle journalists seem to have a view that they should not appear as witnesses in such cases at all (which can lead to them being held in contempt of court for refusing to appear).",1374441374

MakerBot was only founded in 2009 [1], RepRap released their first project in 2007 [2] and the project I was a part of, Fab@Home, open-sourced in 2006 [3].<p>I can&#x27;t speak to the other projects&#x27; motivations, but I know that the fact that patents were expiring made little to no difference on our decision to make a printer.  If you can believe it, the Fab@Home was almost an afterthought.  We had top-of-the-line commercial 3D printers in the lab, but they didn&#x27;t do the kind of custom material jobs required for the project that Evan Malone was doing.  His PhD project was to create a 100% printed-from-scratch robot, and no technology fit the bill.  So, he and Hod built one in order to get that project done.  Like the Oculus, technology had advanced to the point that doing this was actually feasible on a shoestring budget.  It ended up being a project of its own, but it wasn&#x27;t like they saw the patents expiring and all of a sudden decided it&#x27;d be great to open-source a 3d printer design.<p>With how popular 3D printers are getting nowadays, it&#x27;s possible some companies are looking to take advantage of the expiration of SLS patents, but I wouldn&#x27;t hold your breath for an open-source project.

The article discusses frustration about society or the &quot;less-than-ideal&quot; state of things as some of the preconditions leading up to the existential depression that some gifted kids experience.<p>Sure, there remain issues of our smallness, purpose, etc. However, I have often wondered what the Laozi quote you referenced crystallizes so well: what if we weren&#x27;t all induced to participate in this &quot;Matrix&quot; of a society that pushes many of us into a life of subsistence while others profit from our efforts? What if  instead we were more community than competitors and were more free to pursue what fulfills us and betters humankind? Would we feel as small and hopeless? Or would we be empowered and enlightened by our hand in creating and participating in a just society? And would the discoveries and progress that ensue as a result of so much effort and brainpower dedicated to causes other than personal economic benefit actually offset at least some of our sense of lostness and insignificance? That is, would we be more evolved and literally more significant or aware of our significance? Perhaps we humans are actually far, far more powerful and significant than any of us presently realize.<p>The world&#x27;s resources would surely support such an arrangement if our mechanisms for allocating them were more evolved than &quot;mere economics&quot;.<p>Surely, when gifted kids have such thoughts but are instead forced headlong into the Matrix, the temptation towards a more hopeless state and subsequent existential depression becomes highly possible if not probable.",1374440636

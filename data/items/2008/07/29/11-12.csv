No, it's not that I have zero interest in an online operating system, I have no interest in any operating system at all! What I want are quick and convenient applications, and the OS itself is totally irrelevant. So anyone who tries to apply a paradigm that was forced on us to something that we choose to use will ultimately fail.<p>What is needed is not an OS, it's an organiser. A place I store files, write letters, etc. Not some multiple window thingy, but some simply thing that gives me quick access to my applications.<p>Everyone trying to recreate Mac OS or Windows, but webbased is doomed to failure. Mac OS and Windows are used because people don't have a choice as to what desktop paradigm they can use. If one decides to switch, there are no applications, so you are forced into using a particular way.<p>But it has always been a flawed design, so don't copy this stuff.",1217332767
260354,comment,258396,258396,0,0,PieterH,,,"So the point about ZeroMQ's performance is that it removes almost all the messaging overhead, leaving only the network stack and network protocol.  The main cost in conventional messaging is what sits above the network stack, in the messaging products and in the applications.<p>ZeroMQ gets rid of almost all this cost, so lets applications approach full network speed, as zinxq said, 10Gb on a 10Gb network.<p>There is a very big difference between a test program at each end of a network, and an application framework like ZeroMQ, which includes routing and queuing of messages based on the AMQP semantics of exchange and queue.  The real beauty of ZeroMQ is the way it lets developers build fast multithreaded applications without ever worrying about how to scale - everything works as asynchronous messages, between processes on one machine, or processes distributed across wide networks.<p>It is possible to get about 2M kernel traversals per second, in one direction, per core.  So with a perfect scalable messaging product that does not bypass the kernel and TCP/IP stack, you can hope for up to 1M messages per second per core.  Depending on the size of the message you can thus saturate any network.<p>Apart from ZeroMQ, no existing messaging actually manages this.  The very best closed-source products in this space manage 1M messages per second, which is already a big number.<p>To get to the stated goals, ZeroMQ will need to bypass TCP, bypass parts of the kernel, and probably move parts of its routing into silicon.",1217332585

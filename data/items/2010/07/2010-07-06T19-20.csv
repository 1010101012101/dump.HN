(I am not particularly interested in Foucault, so I skipped his reading of him.)<p>Chomsky claims to have found ""Of Grammatology"" full of ""pathetic misreadings.""  Unfortunately, he doesn't take the time to outline what these might be-- and oddly enough, neither does anybody else, to my knowledge.  I know of only one publication claiming that Derrida misreads his sources in ""OG"", and that was in a letter to the Times Literary Supplement many years ago; several responses were published, and personally, I don't think Derrida misread Curtius as claimed.<p>Now, although the subject matter of ""Of Grammatology"" is nominally linguistics, we have to remember that Derrida is not a linguist (nor pretending to be) and is interested, rather, in the philosophical implications of several arguments concerning linguistics made by Saussure, Levi-Strauss and Rousseau.  And, to the best of my knowledge, Chomsky shows no interest in his published writings in the latter two, and isn't much enamored with the former.<p>So, ""Of Grammatology"" is only tangentially related to Chomsky's field of interest.  Which is fine, of course.   But I suspect that this lead him to be more dismissive than necessary: I think he mistakes his lack of interest with Derrida's lack of a point.<p>Derrida <i>does</i> make an important argument in OG, but it is largely aimed at a certain group of Structuralists, who were active in the French academy at the time it was published.  In other words, Derrida's in the middle of a fight that Chomsky has nothing at all to do with, and I think his lack of skin in the game got in the way of an open-minded reading.",1278445502

Wal-Mart sells stuff so cheap in part because they pay their workers low wages. The only way that works is because our tax money is being used to subsidize that income. Thus the cost of the things we buy at Wal-Mart are higher than the ticket price.<p>> Why don't the people who benefit from no crime pool their money and hire a security guard?<p>You mean the shoppers? The workers? Arguably the most efficient method of pooling this money would be for Wal-Mart to charge a little bit more in order to pay someone to patrol their own parking lot.<p>> Sources please.

Any profits they make are distributed to shareholders, or used for building more Wal-Marts elsewhere.

Innovations that make things better for an established market's existing customers tend to be <i>sustaining</i> innovations, benefiting entrenched players.

It's possible to get similar layman explanations for just about anything except for, as he's pointing out certain brands of philosophy.<p>Since we know that a person cannot learn a complex topic at its most complex, they must take simpler stepping stones in a subject till they can achieve comprehension at a high level this implies a couple possibilities:<p>1) People in this field have worked up through these stepping stones, and by building on various axioms and following certain lines of reasoning, it's possible to achieve a level of comprehension that is based on reducible and explainable models of thinking.<p>2) There are no stepping stones and it's complex word gibberish without particular meaning. To get ""in"" to the field, you must master the phrases, secret handshakes and passcodes, to learn the common language of the field, so that you can appear for all purposes as one of the group. It'd be similar to learning a particular dialect of street slang and customs so that you can fit in to a particular neighborhood and not be identified as an immediate outsider. Of course even in that case, words, phrases, actions, customs are all reducible and explainable in simple, general, layman terms (""you wear big clothes and stand and walk like this to thwart the ability of an observer, say the police, in determining if you are carrying a weapon"", ""you say 'jigga-g' when talking about the leader of the gang"", ""you spray tags as markings to indicate territory to other gangs"").<p>If 1 is true, then Chomsky should be able to find somebody, anybody, who could do a passable job at explaining this topic in general layman terms such as is possible in every other field. Perhaps he's not really trying very hard, or perhaps the people who inhabit this discipline are particularly intransigent to formulating an articulation of their field for layman without using the domain vocabulary specific to it?<p>There's a growing consensus external to the field, however, that 2 is true. It would actually be rather simple for the practitioners of this field to counter this sentiment, simply provide a layman's explanation of the topic. But since that seems to be something that nobody can do, and statements like ""And the pressure for greater clarity and simpler exposition is admirable, so far as it goes-- but (as many mathematics texts demonstrate) notation matters. Things should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler-- and this latter part is often difficult."" do nothing to assuage this.<p>The original article of course, highlights one of a number of embarrassing public episodes where a complete outsider strings together a pastiche of phrases into a paper or a presentation or some such, and it passes the muster of the group as being legitimate and meaningful to that group even though it is, by way of purpose, complete gibberish. Again, this further supports the notion that 2 is correct, that the field is composed mostly of nonsense and claims of ""no it's not"" without supporting evidence or a rough, layman's exposition does nothing to counter that.",1278444547

Frankly, I didn't see much in your comment that merited a response. I read it, and thought of all of the other things I ought to be doing, and couldn't justify taking the time to try to clear things up for someone who can't be arsed to clear them up for themselves. I might as well be spending my time arguing with someone proclaiming that the moon landing was a hoax.<p>> <i>So instead of it happening in 10 years, it's going to happen in 90 million years???????</i><p>Your original criticism betrayed a serious bias on your part. Even now, your response to the correction is that ""the numbers are still off"" -- well, no. The range has been <i>narrowed</i>. Technically speaking, the original range is still correct. And, again, this doesn't in any way address the <i>point</i> of the report, which is that many millions of people -- especially the poor -- will be affected by this. Yet, in typical style, rather than addressing this point, people who have a problem with the conclusions of the report are quibbling over the details in it as though that casts some kind of shadow of a doubt over the conclusions of the report.<p>It does not.<p>You then compounded that mistake,<p>> <i>Even Al Gore...</i><p>I actually smirked at this. It would have been totally hilarious, if it were part of a parody. Unfortunately you seem to be completely serious. (Or trolling successfully.)<p>Concern about global warming predates Mr. Gore by quite a bit. However, he's chosen to serve as a spokesperson and representative-of-sorts for the various efforts to mitigate the risks posed by anthropogenic global warming. He is a figurehead, and as such, those with an axe to grind are tilting at him instead of, say, y'know, the facts. His name was nowhere in the article, nowhere else in the comments. You introduced it.<p>Article: ""There was an error in a report.""<p>Comments: ""This proves the report is not trustworthy."" ""No, it doesn't.""<p>You: ""Al Gore Al Gore Alllll Gooooooore!""<p>As far as ""profiting"" from this? This really, really isn't hard to understand. If I wanted to be a spokesperson for space exploration, then it would stand to reason that I am personally interested in space exploration, and it would further stand to reason that I would want to invest in space exploration. Conflict of interest? No, not at all. A conflict of interest only occurs when such a person is in a position to legislate or rule over other people who might disagree. i.e., Gore probably shouldn't serve on a jury against BP; or, if all of those companies were based in a particular state, and he was a representative of that state, then he might legitimately be accused of pork barrel spending if he pushed for a bill increasing funding for those companies.<p>But no such thing is happening. Instead you're reaching into as many ugly paint buckets as possible, and throwing wet brushes: ""He's <i>profiting</i> from this!"" ""It's all <i>his fault</i>!"" Etc.<p>> <i>My biggest problem is that entire countries are basing laws on these findings, which cost citizens billions of dollars in tax revenue.</i><p>Even if I were to agree that this is true -- and I don't -- you are completely ignoring the cost of doing nothing. <i>If</i> it were possible to say that Hurricane Katrina occurred as a direct result of anthropogenic global warming -- which I don't believe, either, by the way -- then wouldn't that imply that the costs of global warming were at least equal to the price tag of Katrina, plus all other costs? This cannot be ignored.<p>And then there's the benefits from continuing to advance ""green"" technologies. I <i>want</i> to see more efficient wind farms; I want to see better solar panel technologies. These are things which <i>move our society forward</i>. We will not advance, technologically, into the next century, by underfunding new technologies and spending the money instead on older technologies.<p>> <i>There is now too much money going around for anyone to really come out with the truth.</i><p>No, the truth is available, but some people aren't listening.<p>> <i>...which was global warming, but got changed for some reason........</i><p>This was the only part of your comment that I briefly considered responding to, and only because I see this idiotic statement way too often.<p>It would be totally trivial to find the answer to this. Easy. Piece-of-cake. But doing so would require you to venture outside your comfort zone, the comfort zone where you believe you already have all the information you need to make an ""informed"" decision.<p>The central issue <i>is</i> warming. When oceans get warmer, when surface and air temperatures get warmer, the climate <i>changes</i>. Thus, ""global warming"" -> ""global climate change"".<p>The maddeningly stupid thing about this particular red herring is that the term change was the result of uninformed people running around shrieking, ""But it's colder this Winter in my town than it was last year!

For a brick-and-mortar business, their risk is the difference between sales that have been billed and product that has been received by the customer.  That might account for a week or two worth of sales volume on a rolling basis, so a business doing $100k a year of PayPal transactions will typically only have $3k-$4k at risk, which is on par with what PayPal will earn by serving such an account over 18-24 months.<p>For a conference, however, there might be six months of revenue for pre-registration before the actual event takes place.  If the event planner then absconds with the money, PayPal could be on the hook for the entire amount, which has long-since been withdrawn and spent.  Take that same hypothetical $100k business for a conference, now all $100k of it is at risk, and PayPal only stands to make $2,500 or so off of that.<p>It's pretty clear that the credit card companies have PayPal by the short-and-curlies, in the sense that PayPal themselves will be on the hook for any chargebacks.<p>I call this the ""wash my Ferrari"" problem.

This one picture really doesn't matter.<p>Why is Apple the only company being called out?

1491979,comment,1491028,1491890,0,0,Jun8,,,"That's not a valid comparison. Approaching <i>everything</i> under the sun with the same copyright approach is untenable, even the greedy music industry and others (e.g., see Hulu) are no longer totally following this approach. A lot of these companies have found that the strong ""I won't give you a single bit of my digital goods if you don't pay"" idea, is unpractical and not good for business. In fact, new web apps <i>do</i> distribute shared logins, on reddit or elsewhere, to get traction, e.g. see this story from just a couple of days ago <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ckcbr/mizage_a_small_development_company_that_made/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/ckcbr/mizage_a_...</a>.<p>That point aside, your comparison is still invalid. Money earned from a webapp goes <i>directly</i> to the developer. However, authors, especially of academic books, which is the kind that is mostly on this site, make <i>very</i> little money from each book sold, just ask a professor who wrote such a book. The books are mostly for academic prestige. Publishers, who still live in a world of their own, try to sell these books for unbelievable amounts, generally $50-$75 a pop. My company buys me (almost) any book I want, but when I was a student in a different country I suffered a lot because of this; we used to Xerox books for almost all our courses.<p>This is not an endorsement to steal any intellectual work. Just a thought that things are not so simple.<p>P.S. For an additional exercise to see why the simplistic approach fails, look into the intellectual battle between poor countries like Brazil and US pharma companies on AIDS IP. Would you say it's stealing in <i>that</i> case, too? Now, work backwards.",1278442952

3737476,comment,3736037,3737221,9,0,drostie,,,"Well, the ""so what"" is everything: Unwanted Attention is Unwanted because it embraces some sort of threat or menace or unreasonable expectation or social tension or unease. To say that we should stop giving women this sort of unwanted attention is not whining or rationalizing, nor is it fanatical egalitarianism. It's just demanding a culture where we men know that it's dangerous to control, frightening to objectify, and despicable to rape. The problem is that we accidentally think of these things as ""you know, just a thing we do."" We just casually say ""I totally owned you at TF2"" or ""he used to be my boss but then I was promoted and I made him my bitch"" -- and if you were asked about the slavery and rape metaphors there you just say ""Lighten up, I wasn't being literal about it.""<p>Power doesn't have to pervade the society, and it's a bit bizarre how it does. Only last year I joined up with an Ultimate club in Delft, after a childhood in the US. I hated sports in the US because it was cutthroat and antisocial. In the Netherlands there is a big difference, ""what sport do you play?"" is actually, like, an everyday question. You're expected to have one. And I liked Ultimate here, at least, because people were immediately giving me tips on how to throw cleaner, how to run better, how to stop faster, how to jump higher. It isn't about someone being Team Captain and you wondering whether you'll get Picked Last. I don't know where we learned that as children, but it was part of this bizarre Culture of Power.<p>And it's the same Power Culture which Joel Spolsky warns entrepreneurs about: don't try to dictate what your artists do; instead try to facilitate, let them express themselves as artists.<p>Power Culture might have ""subtle advantages"" as you say. It probably means that we can hire fewer teachers for larger classrooms, because kids are scared that they might be sent to The Principal's Office.  But the social repercussions are pretty amazing. In a couple centuries I wonder whether this sort of culture will seem as foreign to them as owning slaves seems to us.",1332374287

We were gaining the most traction with work that's often described as narrative or illustrative, and we discovered that the people most excited weren't even thinking about their pieces as investments (in the sense of future resale value). I wouldn't describe this work as kitschy, though - it's got a broad appeal that most people are able to connect with quickly. The narrative aspect is important for motivating people to commission, too - it's not as easy to commission an artist that works in a very minimal style. Even then, I don't think the kind of people that would prefer that sort of work are going to be early adopters.<p>You will notice that we do represent some more contemporary styles. Like any smart startup, we're measuring and exploring different niches. We'll recruit artists based on what people respond to. Moving up the ladder to more expensive and established artists that people regard as investments isn't out of the question as a part of our future.<p>Having said all that - we are working on including more background information in our artist profiles.

The book is actually one of the more readable economics works I've seen, and the author gives a more in-depth account of why competitive markets would normally be believed to work the way you're saying you expect them to work.<p>The basic idea is that even if you operate in a competitive market, your customers and associates may not: and due to this, competitive markets can sometimes only float the ball to some socially-appropriate level. So, let's talk about someone who stops doing business with you because they know your programmers are female and they hold some subconscious belief that female code is of lower quality. (I mean, if you called them on it they would say ""no, of course not!"" but somewhere deep inside they'd prefer the familiar and they discriminate institutionally rather than individually.) Now your incentives to discriminate are bound up in a complex: that complex contains <i>their tastes</i>, and what they're willing to pay to get a product which tastes right to them. If they're in a very competitive market they might not be able to afford <i>any</i> overhead, but if they're a personal user, or they are turning a profit, they get to choose based on their tastes alone and then your financial incentive is to also institutionally discriminate. The whole point is that discrimination might be ""economically rational"" while nondiscrimination might be ""social justice"" and therefore they can come at odds -- which is more or less the topic of the book.<p>I found it an interesting idea.",1332372048

And Zynga wasn't inspired by them. Zynga flat out, straight up, cloned them.<p>When you work your ass off, sacrifice time with your family, your savings, and invest it into building a profitable flash game online, iterating week after week until you get the formula just right. Only to have a bully come by and clone it. That my friend, is NOT borrowing. That's NOT implementing an idea differently. That is theft. Those are unfair business practices.<p>People like me are angry at Pincus because his method, if it becomes popular, could completely fuck up the startup ecosystem.<p>What if ALL of silicon valley starting acting like Pincus? Instead of acquiring sites and IP fairly, they simply cloned them. What if Google simply cloned YouTube div for div, color for color, feature for feature? What if Amazon cloned the technology used in Kiva's robotic logistics system instead of acquiring the company? What if Microsoft cloned skype and its algorithms instead of acquiring it? This isn't Github where you can fork someone else's work. These are companies that people put their lives and savings accounts into.<p>Here's how it works:<p>1: Crazy young entrepreneurs risk everything to find a new profitable business or build a new product. Because they're small they can easily pivot and reiterate day after day and evolve their product/solution/business faster than a big company.<p>2: They find something that works, VCs jump on board to grow the business/product/service and the crazy young entrepreneurs who worked their asses off expand their business/service/product.<p>3: Big players like Microsoft, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon can use their muscle and dollars to acquire the startup and assimilate it into itself and offer this unique new service/business/product to their established customers. Thus benefiting the entrepreneurs who try new things, the investors who help grow new things, the big players with lots of established customers, and the end users. So many people benefit from this ecosystem.<p>What Zynga does is dangerous. It basically gives the little guy the finger, steals their hard earned IP and doesn't give anything back. This is what makes it despicable. Most entrepreneurs keep their voice down about it because they don't want to look like angry disgruntled losers who are envious of a successful entrepreneur. But if you don't call it out and say anything about it and on top of that give Pincus a CEO of the year award... That hurts all of us.<p>On top of all this, Zynga sees nothing wrong with what it does. Again, if they were open about the whole thing they'd be seen in a slightly better light. Still unethical copycats that hurt an ecosystem but at least honest about it. If they did the right thing and properly acquired the games they clone, we'd all be cheering Pincus on.",1332371785

You have no idea who I am or what I've worked on. One of the sites I worked on was yellowpages.com. That's a top 1000 site, but even that doesn't tell the full story.

The person sitting next to me right now worked on espn.go.com before she transferred to my group. I can assure you that espn.go.com could easily be served with ruby instead of java.<p>I'm questioning a couple of specific claims made by bad_user. That all big sites use the JVM or c/c++ or .net. I think that is false, or the definition of ""big"" is so narrow as to be meaningless for 99.9% of programmers. I'm also questioning the claim that the best backend is the one that is the fastest. I'd argue that the best backend is the one that is fast enough and the cheapest, wouldn't you agree? As I mentioned before, I was working on an api that served requests for bing maps with a very tight SLA. We ran it on MRI ruby, and we met the SLA.<p>Here's something that people often forget, you can put things like varnish in front of your API.

Newspapers do NOT have a monopoly on that.<p>Also, I intentionally did not include 'government related funding' in my mention of what's worth learning from public media's business model. I stressed the role of listeners and the value that public media has been able to gain from developing a reliable and meaningful RELATIONSHIP with listeners. That has taken 40 years to build.<p>I agree that investigative reporting is a high point and necessary one for journalism, but let's not discount the importance of day in, day out reporting that informs and accurately reflects the life, doings, role, malfeasance of institutions and people of a community. There are some impressive local blogs and sites that do an ambitious job of capturing a pretty full picture of what is going on. My hat's off to them. They need support. Reporting on scandals and forcing out the scoundrels is only one measure of the value of a good news outfit.<p>Newspaper ownership is a mixed bag; some owners would not know the First Amendment if it bit them. But then there is the McClatchy chain whose DC bureau did some of the most outstanding and aggressive reporting on the lead up to the Iraq War. No one paper or news organization performs well or poorly all the time. But I take the point of one poster here, I think, that a newspaper is only as good as its owners' and leaderships' commitment to independence and the role of an aggressive press.<p>What is killing a lot of papers -- and my op ed only touches on the mix of factors -- is high production costs, debt and relevance of these brands and forms to audiences with many other choices. The NYTimes HAS an audience, so does the WSJournal. But so does Google and Slashdot and Mashable and Gawker. The news space is crowded with a lot of value for new audiences hungry for the right mix. If you find your news sites valuable to you, then support their business model. What we need are credible, accurate and competitive news businesses.<p>Thank you all for the thoughtful feedback. This is the sort of debate and discussion I was hoping the oped would generate.<p>Finally, this crazy notion that journalism is not that hard.  It is. Good journalism is very hard, demanding, damning and public.

It has become extremely common to manufacture women's blouses without the second button, or rather, with the second button roughly 6 inches below the first one. I suspect this is due to rules in schools and workplaces allowing for the top button to be left unbuttoned. That way, you're following the rule and showing some decolletage. I once went through every button-up blouse I could find at Target. I came away with having found one rack that had shirts with an upper-chest button. (Oh, and if you button all the buttons on one that's missing that upper-chest one, it just gapes open)<p>If the shirt itself is not quite wide enough to accommodate being well-endowed, a lower neckline can allow the fabric to move horizontally to better fit around the girth involved by opening up a bit wider.

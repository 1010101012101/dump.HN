I could turn it on for everyone.  Would anyone want that?<p>The advantage/disadvantage of using messages is that they wouldn't be tied to a particular comment.  There's also the disadvantage that everyone would invoke whatever that quote is about every system evolving till it adds messaging...",1202578642

I know net neutrality is not about being able to say what you want about political issues -- it's about whether a network is owned by the people who built it or the people who create content on it -- and the content guys have convinced you that it's some kind of moral struggle.<p>Just reread the wiki article without reference to medium, and then explain to me why I should be allowed to purchase a pen and piece of paper, given that my ownership of a medium of communication would allow me to control what content is placed on that means of communication. It's a difference of degree, not kind.",1202578385

We macho geniuses are supposed to know it all and have perfect control of the room (especially if pg is around)...or at least we need to give that impression; and what better way to learn how than to get private feedback on hacker news?<p>Also, why are people modding the grandparent up?",1202577701

I've been wondering what would be a good protocol to aggregate ""web 2.0"" (which is what people need) and I think this is it.  The only thing missing is a way to combine the different feeds together into a single application.  Is snap recursive?  I.e. you could feed feeds into a feed?  Can snap become an FPL?<p>Now, the trick is to make the standard catch on.  I wish you guys luck!",1202577537

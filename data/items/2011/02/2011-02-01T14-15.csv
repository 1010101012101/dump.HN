2165686,comment,2165469,2165469,0,0,mkowalski,,,"It's interresting. A little bit like browser wars, isn't it? Browsers are really similar between themselves. If any new noteworthy feature appears in one, it is very likely to be copied to another, which is a very good thing for end users and is a reason for which competitiveness is good. At the end of the day, users want more-less the same functionality, no matter which browser they use. There are some differences in details and quality, but rather minor.<p>Both Bing and Google are targeted towards mass market and I think people expect the same from both. If Google does it right, there is nothing more to invent. And even if there is, it is probably pretty expensive. It is so much easier to copy than to invent from scratch, just to get something almost exactly the same as Google :)<p>I am really interrested in what could Bing do to be REALLY different or better than Google. And if they did, Google would most likely do something very similar :)",1296572361

That's academically true, but practically misleading. When developing my app, I have to assume any part of the system could fail at any time. Thus my whole app needs to be written with failure in mind.<p>In an ACID system, that means my transactions either happen or don't, and it's on me to figure out whether they did or not. Sometimes I'll need to do some investigating after a failure to find out what succeeded and what rolled back.<p>In an eventually consistent system, I need a contingency plan for every operation on the system. Now that contingency plan might be very simple, such as ""Whatever happened, happened and last writer wins."" The CALM conjecture paper does a decent job of describing when this might be a workable contingency plan. More complicated operations require increasingly complex contingency plans. This is why Cassandra is now offering counters as an API feature, because something as simple as counters is really hard to get right in all failure scenarios.<p>If you fit the CALM description and require multi-data center availability, then EC is probably a good bet. It may still be a good bet otherwise, but the availability comes along with a much more difficult app development picture, failures or no.",1296571681

But what Bing does is when you use its toolbar, it watches what you do and uses that information to rank results. Is that really copying? It showed Google's Honeypot page because Google's engineers were clicking on the Honeypot page with the toolbar installed. That isn't copying Google's results, that's copying the actions of Bing toolbar users.<p>This can easily be demonstrated. Google can set up a second honeypot but instruct its engineers not to click on the link, ever. If it shows up in Bing's results, then Bing is watching what Google returns and scraping its results.<p>But if the second Honeypot doesn't show up in Bing's results, then clearly Bing isn't copying Google's results, it's copying its toolbar's preference for links.<p>The entire thing is moot to me.

Certainly faster than I've ever gotten a response from Sun.<p>Average over the last 3 issues is about 48 hours - if accepted as a bug. But if you provide source code that demonstrates the problem turnaround is usually very fast, and that seems to be the case here.",1296569160

In my experience, the thinking process thought and praised in liberals arts fields is in some respects quite different from that in any technical field, as to sometimes be a real impediment in communication.<p>One example from a topic I worked on: author attribution using stylometry. To a CS (or EE or whatever) the thought that you can take a corpus composed of writings from various authors and train classifiers to differentiate the unique styles of each would be mundane. To some English majors, such a strong structuralist approach would border on sacrilegious (remember Prof. Keating's reaction to such an approach to judge poetry in <i>Dead Port's Society</i>). Each approach has something to be said for it but it has to be done delicately, otherwise polite discussion becomes impossible.",1296569109

2165482,comment,2164861,2165007,0,0,jacobolus,,,"Why would you expect the mean of a set of numbers to be the reciprocal of the mean of reciprocals of those numbers? It seems pretty obvious that those two operations (taking the reciprocal of the numbers, taking the mean) can’t be reordered.<p>To take a trivial example, the mean of 1 and 2 is 3/2, but the mean of 1 and 1/2 is 3/4. It’s easy to see that 3/2 ≠ 4/3. Now let’s try something that pumps the difference up. The mean of 1/1000 and 1 is 1001/2000, about half. On the other hand, the mean of 1000 and 1 is 1001/2, about 500. Clearly 500 is not the reciprocal of 1/2.<p>In the case where we have the two sticks, the ratio of small to big is going to have to be somewhere between 0 and 1, because we’re taking the mean of a set of numbers between 0 and 1. On the other hand, in the ratio of big to small, we’re taking the mean of a set of numbers between 1 and ∞.",1296569032

The antenna fails, but the problem is fixed with a case.  Furthermore , here's something else that I never saw anyone mention:  The receiver has a terrible echo in some locations.  Possibly because there is a rock cliff behind my house (I live on the coast of the Atlantic Ocean, so the rocks are, shall we say, moist).  I imagine that has something to do with the origin of the echo, but it's awfully close (the round-trip time for the radio signal would be imperceptible, so something else must be going on; if it was a tower problem I would think others would have mentioned it).  I can fix the echo, sometimes by moving and other times by simply turning the phone.<p>I have an iphone 4.  The others in my family have had or currently have iphones 1, 2, and 3.

2165470,comment,2165283,2165283,0,0,zdw,,,"I feel that linux has reached parity with other OS's in all ways but these:<p>1 - Continuity of applications.  For example, in updating Ubuntu on a laptop I use for compiling embedded kernels, I lost the swanky power management window that could tell me things about battery charge/discharge rates.   No idea where it went.  Then the next version changed the interface again.   Adding and removing apps between versions causes problems, if only from jarring users from how things used to work.  This is the main reason that I don't support Linux on the desktop as much as I could - I can't more than a few versions of ""how the GUI works for program X"" when X seems to be replaced frequently.<p>2 - Hardware compatibility at the edges.  The core works great - the problem is with weird/proprietary things (binary drivers, etc...).   I don't have a solution for this, other than proper hardware choices at purchase, which is harder than you think.<p>3 - Microsoft specific formats.  I'm talking .doc/.xls/etc.    These are the biggest reason people ""can't"" switch - they have too much rolled up in these old crappy formats that don't convert perfectly to OO.org.   90% of those problems are formatting/fonts/printing/interchange related.   The BIGGEST win Microsoft ever had was getting their XML formats (.docx/.xlsx/etc.) approved - had the standards bodies and governments rejected them, everyone, on all platforms (Windows included), would be in a much better place now.",1296568837

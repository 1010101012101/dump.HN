Yes, you should understand how to identify your really bad queries using whatever tools your RDBMs provides, but I've always found that you have a very small number of problematic queries are the runtime monsters.

Perhaps because the nature of our work is such that, in a sense, bugs are there because of our own personal failings and mistakes. We deal with that all day, every day. How could anyone, when faced with such an ever-present reminder of their own deficiencies, honestly think of themselves as the best?<p>(Although in thinking about this, perhaps maintenance programmers are most prone to this as their task is largely to fix bugs in other people's code - not their own. It'd be easier to fall into that trap, I imagine.)<p>I suspect that most ""I'm the best ever"" talk is just a game. A form of ""blowing off steam.""

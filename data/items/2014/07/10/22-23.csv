8017878,comment,8015445,8016658,5,0,chipotle_coyote,,,"Speaking broadly, that&#x27;s not true. Monopolies are not intrinsically illegal. Antitrust law is specifically about business practices, and the notion that monopolies have to be more restricted because they can use their domination of one market to affect related markets. What got Microsoft into trouble wasn&#x27;t having 90% of the operating system market, it was the allegation that they were using that monopoly to take over the nascent browser market, force OEMs to accept terms that prevented alternative OSes from competing on level ground, and so on.<p>I suspect Amazon is on their way to running afoul of such laws, or would be if the current business climate wasn&#x27;t comparatively hostile to the notion of this kind of regulation. I don&#x27;t think, however, that Zocalo is going to be a piece that attracts much attention; it&#x27;s going to be the way Amazon seems to increasingly deal with their suppliers in Walmart-esque fashion. (Walmart was notorious for going beyond merely asking for &quot;large customer&quot; discounts and heading into &quot;we will tell you what wholesale price we&#x27;re going to pay, and you will either make it work or you&#x27;ll lose the 60-70% of your business we represent.&quot;)",1405033181

8017865,comment,8016021,8016247,1,0,api,,,"I completely agree. I&#x27;m seeing an increasing amount of real evidence backing up skepticism over what I call the &quot;cult of the 80 hour work week.&quot;<p><a href=""http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/sleep-as-a-competitive-advantage/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/27/sleep-as-a-competitiv...</a><p>I think it&#x27;s quantity vs. quality. There are times when a huge overtime crunch is needed or when something is &quot;on fire&quot; and has to be dealt with right now, but the data is showing that overwork, lack of sleep, and too much focus on only one thing results in a loss of higher-order mental capacities such as creativity and long-term thinking.<p>I&#x27;ve experienced this subjectively myself... doing the workaholic thing for more than month or two and literally being unable to remember what it was that I was really doing or why I was doing it. You basically degenerate into some kind of crank-out-the-next-thing automaton with no big picture thinking ability or vision.<p>I&#x27;ve also seen second hand what occurs when this happens to a company&#x27;s leadership, and I think a lot of avoidable failure spirals originate this way. If you&#x27;re not being successful you need to pivot, and that takes creativity and an ability to stand outside the box of what you&#x27;re currently doing. Those mental abilities are the first to go in an overwork scenario.<p>Other negatives include depression, anxiety, and impulsive behavior. It was actually kind of scary. I had to give up the tech entrepreneur orbit for a while until I could re-center myself, and coming back to it now I consider it very important to avoid that trap.<p>Personally I think the cult of workaholism is more about machismo than real performance. There&#x27;s this weird ego thing in a number of industries including tech where people brag about how many hours they work, how little they sleep, etc. It&#x27;s stupid.",1405033038

The fact that some 10Mbps link is at 23% utilization is of no utility. Neither is the capacity of links not connected to the relevant customers.

There was quite a bit of sacrifice involved for many many years towards one single goal, but damn if the people involved didn&#x27;t take a great amount of pride in their accomplishment afterwards.

It&#x27;s also useful to note that the cost of upgrading a link is tiny in the terms of these companies - on the order of $10-20k[1].  Netflix already pays to have sufficient capacity at their end of the connection; it is the ISP&#x27;s responsibility to do the same, since their customers are paying to access <i>whatever internet content they want</i>. It is unreasonable to expect Netflix to pay for a separate, unnecessary connection.

(If there is a representation of the main resource which would do this that is acceptable to the client, this would seem to be an ideal way of communicating that.)<p>With PATCH, much the same, but with 200 OK.<p>> Do i have to first re-get the created object&#x27;s child locations and re-request each individually?<p>There&#x27;s no reason for a REST API to require that.<p>> How about just sending the full object state back as the response to my PUT request?<p>I see no reason why sending a full resource representation in a 201 status response, provided that the client has indicated that they are willing to accept the relevant media type, is problematic, especially if it does what the HTTP/1.1 spec says the 201 response entity should do. (The one thing that common resource representations might not do that they should is provide their own location and the direct locations of any embedded subentities that are separate addressable, but there is no reason why a resource representation <i>couldn&#x27;t</i> do that, and I&#x27;d argue that in REST it would be desirable that resource representations <i>do</i> do that.)<p>> Well, according to REST, the body of the response just needs to be a description of the error or success status.<p>As, stated, that&#x27;s accurate, but you seem to be acting as if that was &quot;needs to be just&quot; rather than &quot;just needs to be&quot; (e.g., misunderstanding it as a <i>maximum allowed</i> content, rather than a <i>minimum required</i> content.)<p>> Basically, REST sucks for reducing round trips if you&#x27;re going to follow it pedantically.<p>Except that none of the problems you&#x27;ve pointed to in that regard have anything to do with REST.",1405031272

PUT effectively replaces the state of the resource so you get it back right away (get the latest state, which should be what was sent in the request, minus a conflict for example if multiple clients do it or you have some incrementing revision id thing)<p>> For example, what if a single PUT request creates multiple sub-objects?<p>I&#x27;d use POST for creating/adding objects. I think of PUT usually as idempotent and as I mentioned above, use it to replace the state of the resource.  So if this one POST ends up creating multiple-sub-objects you can return a json object that encapsulates URIs do those new objects.<p>Remember resources don&#x27;t have to map to internal objects, db rows or other such things. You can have the objects or db rows represented or used in different resources. If it makes sense and if you have this transactional interface, maybe it makes sense to have an explicit transaction resource that is in charge of managing a transaction (where multiple things happen and then it kind of becomes very explicit).",1405030312

He was sued for contributing to the attacks and lost. These were correct addresses and it was true that they were abortion doctors, but a court nonetheless considered their publication to constitute an implied threat of harm to the doctors in question. There are some less dramatic cases involving the &quot;public disclosure of private facts&quot; tort, against which truth is not a defense (though an address would not usually be considered a private fact).<p>In the traditional (pre-automation) era intent played a large role. This worked out okay in most cases, because harmful things (like Horsley&#x27;s site) tended to only show up as a result of malevolent intent. Sites with lists of abortion doctors&#x27; home addresses didn&#x27;t just show up innocently, so if nobody had malevolent intent, they wouldn&#x27;t show up.

8017623,comment,8016756,8017035,6,0,Fezzik,,,"The study appears to be using &quot;arrested&quot; to mean &quot;convicted of a crime for which the person could have been arrested (taken in to police custody)&quot;? Example: I have never been arrested/taken in to police custody but, I was convicted of providing alcohol to minors at a college party and, had I not willingly taken the citation from the officer or, had I been belligerent and uncooperative, I could have been arrested. Technically, you could argue while the officer was issuing me the citation I was under some sort of arrest, but that does not comport with either the legal notion of being under arrest or what most people think of as being under arrest.*<p>Given the journal, that seems like an odd error to make. I could have that wrong, but it would make sense given that article specifically mentions truancy and underage drinking, two charges which seldom result in arrest.<p>Maybe that makes the statistic a little less shocking to those surprised by the number? Again, I certainly could be wrong, but it really would be surprising if the 40% refers to people actually having been read Miranda rights, hand cuffed, placed in a police car, etcetera. Even for other common crimes for that age group, like possession (generally marijuana), usually a citation is issued and the drugs are seized but no arrest is made. This is all said from the perspective of a judicial clerk in Portland, Oregon, who works a lot with the dockets related to citations related to minor misdemeanor offenses. Perhaps it is different in other states.<p>Anecdotally: almost everyone I know well  has been convicted of a misdemeanor of some sort for which they could have been arrested but only one person I know has ever been taken in to police custody.<p>* <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest#United_States_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrest#United_States_2</a>",1405029638

People tend to see an arrest and leap to conclusions.\nI say this as a person who has never been arrested. :/<p>> Anything that might make someone unemployable that didn&#x27;t result in a conviction or other defeat in court.<p>> The topic is arrests.\nThe fact you never shower is not going to get you arrested.<p>I guess to me the pattern was obvious but I accept it wasn&#x27;t obvious to you. Yes, the topic is related to arrests & court cases.",1405029630

When the tools of creation, promotion, and distribution become more accessible, it stands to reason that the attention gets spread over a larger number of artists.<p>I just think about my own history of music-fandom and compare my childhood in the 1980s and my teens and early 20&#x27;s in the 1990s with my listening habits now and it&#x27;s crazy to think how I used to only really know about those big name acts that got lots of radio and TV airplay.  Nowadays I can listen to something new (or something old I just discovered) every day and never seem to run out.  Just as during my younger days, I still only buy like 5 full albums every year but back then, they were more likely to be the same 5 albums another young rock fan bought as well.  Now they could be anything that really stuck out to me and I wanted to add to my collection.<p>More players means less platinum albums but more variety.  I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s easier than ever to find something that really appeals to you rather than just picking from the relatively shallow pool of the top few albums in a given genre every year.",1413820633

8482752,comment,8480551,8480850,0,0,jonsterling,,,"1. Call-by-value gives us both the ability reason by induction. It also typically results in the presence of non-pointed types, whereas Haskell only has pointed types.<p>2. Call-by-value gives us the ability to safely interleave effects. Now, I know you all think we should not be doing that at all, but I would say that this is only true in some cases. The point of reifying an effect in a monad is not because &quot;effects are icky&quot;; it is because we have written a non-extensional operation using effects, and we want it to be an extensional function. Wrapping it up in the monad &quot;completes&quot; the operation as such. However, there are plenty of extensional functions which may be written using computational effects (such as memoization): these should not be wrapped up in the monad. (FYI, it&#x27;s the effects that preserve extensionality which is what Bob calls &quot;benign effects&quot;, to the consternation of Haskell developers everywhere.) ML gives us the fine-grainedness to make these choices, at the cost of some reasoning facilities: more proofs must be done on paper, or in an external logical framework. I tend to think that the latter is inevitable, but some disagree.<p>I am hoping for a middle-ground then: something <i>like</i> ML, in that effects are fundamental and not just bolted onto the language with a stack of monads; something like Haskell, where we can tell what effects are being used by a piece of code.<p>The story hasn&#x27;t been fully written on this, but I think that Call-by-push-value can help us with both recovering the benefits of laziness as well as reasoning about effects.<p>3. Modularity is something which Haskell people simply do not take seriously, even with the new &quot;backpack&quot; package-level module system they are building. One of the most-loved reasoning facilities present in Haskell depends, believe it or not, on global scope, and is therefore inherently anti-modular (this is the uniqueness of type class instances). As a result, you can never add modularity to Haskell, but we may be able to back-port some of the more beloved aspects of Haskell to a new nephew in the ML family.<p>(Confusingly, laziness advocates often say that their brand of functional programming has better &quot;modularity&quot; than strict, because of the way that you can compose lazy algorithms to get more lazy algorithms that don&#x27;t totally blow up in complexity. I would say that lazy languages are more &quot;compositional&quot;, not more &quot;modular&quot;â€”I prefer to use the latter term for modularity at the level of architecture and systems design, not algorithms.)",1413820494

This is why you need to pitch your idea through a PR company, and never &quot;cold call&quot; send it yourself. Journalists do not have the ability to see why something is interesting or different; that is why they are journalists reporting on what others are doing and not devevlopers or doers themselves.<p>If you want your idea to get noticed, you need to either know a journalist personally and ask a favour, or throw a free drinks launch party, RSVP. Then you will get some results. Failing both of those, you need to hire specialist PR to push your message. They do all the things you cannot do; offer freebies down the road, invitations to parties, access to celebrities in whatever field, scoops, etc.<p>The other way to generate interest is to avoid the press entirely, and go directly to the public by whatever means is convenient and cost effective. If you&#x27;ve written a new Perl Module, suggesting it to TechCrunch will not get you anywhere, but posting on a relevant forum will. Of course, TechCrunch cant tell what is interesting in advance, wether its a Perl Module or some new consumer device no one has heard of or thought of before.<p>Then there is the problem of noise. Even if all journalists were capable of understanding the ideas and products that are sent to them, and the way these ideas and products will interact with other parts of the economy six level in, they do not have time to look seriously at everything that is sent to them, and so they must use some form of filter. A convenient one is the PR firm, that packages, and contextualizes the idea for them, so that ideally, they do not even have to do any writing themselves, they just copypasta the press release and photos that are handed to them on a plate. From their point of view, this is ideal. They get their work done for them, they are made to look like they have their finger on the pulse of the hottest ideas, and they don&#x27;t have to do any writing or research or photography themselves.<p>This is the reality of not only tech news, but of all news where new products are mentioned.

I also avoid ingesting a lot of sugar at once and caffeine, with this I feel less tired at the end of the day.

Lots of the reasons why are more due to real-life (TM) than the job market. At 20, you don&#x27;t really mind renting a spare bedroom in the basement of somebody&#x27;s house and working 100+ weeks trying to build the latest whatever non-world transforming consumer web thing. You <i>have</i> all the time in the world and no obligations beyond growing your career. You&#x27;re living to work at this point.<p>At 40+ you probably have a couple kids, a mortgage, a spouse, education loans, car payments, family vacations, pets, children&#x27;s activities, children&#x27;s pets, your own personal activities, cocktail parties, maybe saving up for your kids&#x27; college educations, whatever. Unless you&#x27;ve found yourself without these kinds of obligations, your job will end up being defined as something that can fit a work to live scenario. This is very hard to do in the previously described scenario.<p>So what&#x27;s left? Some startups will let you do the 9-5/5 40 hour work week, but the reality is that big boring mega corps, building boring B2B insurance/inventory/timecard processing/bleh software is where you&#x27;re likely to find the kinds of jobs that fit your new &quot;adult&quot; lifestyle. And you know what? You won&#x27;t really care all that much.<p>If you do care, and you&#x27;re tired of figuring out the access permissions for this role as part of that use-case for the umpteenth million time, you can career shift into management and start learning about the business you were supporting as a developer.

I haven&#x27;t done that too much since it seems less useful in my personal usage cases but the option is there.<p>The only thing I&#x27;d love to see is something more along the lines of Miracast where you have the option of sending content over an ad-hoc connection between your device and the Chromecast.  I considered something like a Chromecast for conference rooms at work but since you need to be on the same WiFi network, that&#x27;s not really an option since the accessible WiFi network at the office has restrictions and limitations that would make Chromecast unusable.  It would be nice if I could purchase several of these inexpensive devices that could easily enable streaming from online media providers but could also receive content directly from devices within range (like the laptops and tablets of people in a meeting) without needing to install separate access points just for Chromecast.",1413817353

Sometimes we forget that there&#x27;s plenty of people who have simply built up a clientele and a repuation through plain old networking. These jobs tend to be more lucrative and probably don&#x27;t require you to learn the flavor-of-the-month js framework. It&#x27;s no surprise that we don&#x27;t see many experienced professionals competing for what are essentially entry-level jobs (despite the use of the word senior in the job title and despite the high salaries inexperienced developers command). Obviously not all experienced professionals have built up that network. Those are the people you see applying for jobs.<p>Source: I spent a couple years getting to know a network of CTO&#x27;s and architects who have been doing ecommerce since it&#x27;s inception.

8482429,story,,,1,1,bozho,"Why aren't tech journalists responding to pitches?",,"I&#x27;ve had several announcements about pet-projects of mine that got to the front page of HackerNews. And although that doesn&#x27;t mean that the projects were promising, game-changing, or investor-attracting, it at least means they are somewhat noteworthy in the technology world.<p>My pet projects are not a startup, but nevertheless I pitch them to popular tech news sites, for the sake of the experiment. With absolutely zero response. At some point several people (including here on HN) pointed out that I should not write to the generic, catch-all news@sometechnewssite.com, but I should target individual authors that seem to be interested in similar topics. And so I did; with no response whatsoever, again.<p>Two concerns:<p>1. Why do they have a news@ / tips@ emails, if nobody reads that?<p>2. Are technology people, and especially startup founders at the mercy of tech journalists, trying to get personal connections to them in order to get something published?<p>While my projects are not my startups, and I&#x27;ve not thrown money at them, I imagine the confusion that a startup may have, when it hits a brick wall when trying to get publicity.<p>It seems that tech journalists (not all of them, of course) are not quite competent, but are also over-confident (just like any other journalist, actually). And they not only report &quot;news&quot; from the technology field (though many of the big tech sites are not tech tabloids; just look at the front page of Mashable), but they are also often judges of whether a startup is good or bad. And I don&#x27;t believe they are competent in that either.<p>On the other hand, does it actually matter? If a piece of technology is really good, it probably won&#x27;t need TechCrunch coverage to be successful.<p>Maybe only the readers suffer from the inability of tech journalists to curate interesting content. But on the other hand - that&#x27;s why we have hacker news.",1413817293

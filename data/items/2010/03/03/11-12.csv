1163902,comment,1163841,1163841,0,0,lpolovets,,,"Cool idea.<p>Both the article and other sites (<a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2230"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-2230</a> is an example) suggest that 3-20x performance improvements are typical.<p>I've worked on this problem before, and it seems like there are also simpler (and less memory intensive) ways of speeding up the computation. For example you can use properties like string lengths (or character distributions within strings) to get results that are just as good if not better. If you have a corpus of 1 million strings and you want to find all strings within an edit distance of 2 to a query, you can automatically eliminate any strings among the corpus whose length differs by > 2 from the length of the query string. Also, if you are willing to store 1-2 bytes of metadata about each string, you can use that metadata to very quickly generate lower bounds on edit distances, avoiding the O(N^2) distance computation whenever the lower bound is greater than your max tolerable distance. A good example of metadata would be to store (for each string in the corpus) the number of characters with ascii codes that are 0 mod 5, 1 mod 5, ... 4 mod 5.",1267617512

Initially it seems a weird choice of word: basically ""hey, if your not with us your against us. Oh and were going to burn you out"". On the other hand I think it's one used in science history books quite a lot (still in a negative context though) so perhaps it is because the guy is a scientist and that's how non-conformists are considered.<p>Or then again maybe it is just a political choice of words attempting to undermine anyone that does pick at the data.<p>(as an aside the guy is wrong - some of the biggest scientific advances come from ""heretics"" making big and controversial discoveries)",1267616151

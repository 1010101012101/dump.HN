4398460,comment,4397576,4398030,3,0,ZoFreX,,,"There's a very good reason to make it run only on Facebook - it's a ""Facebook game"", through and through.<p>To be clear, this isn't a real-time strategy game. It is no different to any of the hundreds of ""skinner box"" games already on Facebook. I let the app access my Facebook, but refused to let it post anything to my friends (make posts from this app available to: only me). Every time I reach an action where it wants me to message my friends or post to my wall (these are frequent) the app crashes and I have to restart it to continue. Probably not a coincidence!<p>In addition you can click on buildings in progress to speed them up, initially for free but I've played enough of these games to know soon that resource will become limited, unless I spam my friends or fork out cash.<p>From a gameplay perspective, you just click on what it tells you you need to be clicking on next, and then do quests to unlock more items that you can click on. You collect resources from your resource harvesting buildings by clicking on them periodically when they are full, an absolutely classic FB game feature that is completely absent from any actual PC game or RTS game.<p>Lastly, it doesn't even leverage the HTML platform well. One thing I expect from HTML is for things to be at least semi-usable on many devices, and in particular I expect sites to work well on reasonable resolutions. I'm on a MBP and even in fullscreen mode, I couldn't get the whole game to fit on screen, and so had to scroll in the browser to be able to click on some of the buttons. This really negatively impacted my experience of button clicking, especially as sometimes it took me a long time to figure out which button I was being told to click.<p>Edit: Played on for a few more minutes, and sure enough, time, money, or friends. I can really, really recommend that anyone on HN who hasn't played one of these games creates a throwaway Facebook account and tries one out, just to see how vacuous and manipulative these games really are.",1345233578

Talent and hard work are a pre-requesite, but everything from winning the genetic lottery (passport from an Industrialized country) to being attractive.<p>For another example... in 1999, a Canadian band called The Tea Party had a #1 single called ""Heaven Coming down,"" and had a great run in Canada, but they never became the global sensation Nickelback did, despite having talent.

Testing things like the color of a call-to-action button can certainly direct you to a local optima, but in a larger sense it misses the point. You can A/B test a whole bunch of small changes, but the really impactful ones take a unified vision that changes the whole design strategy of a website or product. Google didn't go from old Gmail to new Gmail by incrementally changing things based on testing, they took a good hard look at the pain points of the old site and applied a new visual direction to the site. The iPhone didn't come around by tweaking a phone piece by piece until people liked it better. It came around because someone had a vision and saw it through.<p>Don't get me wrong, usability testing is incredibly important. Every programmer can tell you how much they learned the first time they watched an uncoached newbie try out their software. And even with those paradigm-shifting design changes, you can and should test that the results are really an improvement.

  and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who
  comes short again and again, because there is no effort
  without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive
  to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great 
  devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the
  best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and
  who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring
  greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold

One of the problems with studies of environmental <i>non</i>-depleted (read: worse) uranium exposure is that results tend to be dominated by effects of environmental thorium such that any effects from uranium are below the noise floor.<p>Depleted uranium is a pretty harmless environmental contaminant as heavy metals go.

However there are a couple of things that alleviate the problems with reading the DNA.<p>1) DNA sequencing technology is currently advancing much faster than silicon technology, so give it time and it's likely that it will catch up with current hard disk reading speed at comparable sizes and volumes.
2) DNA's self-hybridizing nature makes it easy to pull out blocks with specific addresses (if you wait for the hybridization). So if you include address labels in the DNA as you write it out, you can probably pull it out in chunks of kilobase to megabase at a time.
3) As the other commenter pointed out, this is extremely easy to parallelize. So if you want to go twice as fast, divide the sample in half put half in each machine. Dilute and pipette as necessary.",1345230616

What I'm worried about is that non-technical people will skim this article and think that design is easier than coding. There's a rabbit hole in every discipline and my experience has been that the attributes that makes someone a decent programmer are usually the same attributes that makes someone a decent designer. In fact, I'd go as far to say that the attributes that make anyone decent at anything are usually the same for anything else.<p>So if you ""want to learn to code"" and for some reason cannot, then I'm going to bet you have other issues that prevents you from doing so, which is the sentiment Dan Shipper (the original comment this poster was responding to) basically attributed to ""false constraints.""<p>I guess the argument comes down to believing that coding (like most people believe about design) requires some innate talent to be able to do it. And while I believe that might be the case to be great at it, I truly do believe almost everyone should be able to learn to code (or design) if they truly want it enough.<p>Like with anything, I prefer people not to go into a field if they're not passionate about it. Don't code if you're not into it. And don't come into design because it's Plan B. Code because you love it. Design because you can't get enough of it. If you're non-technical and your passionate about wanting to build technical things, then you really only have one avenue for that outlet if you can't somehow convince others to help build those things for you and that's learn it the hard way.",1345230340

Lack of feedback is disenfranchising (unless you fake vote counts for comment-makers to see, which could have a worse effect of giving the wrong signals.)<p>Also, you can't count on there being proportional amounts of activity among the earlier users currently.

4398131,comment,4396747,4397771,6,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Two issues here:<p>1) Stories become popular despite negative sentiment in comments, or stated another way, some of the most popular stories on the front page of HN have little support in the comments. This indicates that the people who up-vote the stories in question are either not actually in support of the story's premise, or choose to remain silent in the discussion.<p>2) People are using up-votes as a way to bookmark stories, since that's the only flagging mechanism available to them.<p>The root of the first problem as I see it is that it is too easy too up-vote stories. This creates a low threshold for groups of organized users, i.e. friends of the poster, to get stories on the front page. Perhaps limiting the ability to up-vote stories in particular would have a positive impact here.<p>The second problem has an extremely simple solution: add a way for users to flag stories without up-voting them. Maybe a star icon that adds a story to their 'saved' directory.",1345230087

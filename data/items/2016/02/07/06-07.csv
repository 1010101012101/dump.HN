This is definitely not the case.<p>Let&#x27;s pretend there are no races for a second. What would racist people do? They would probably still hate on &quot;others&quot;. They would probably not have the vocabulary or the knowledge to group people, but they would still hate &quot;others&quot;. The fact that racist hate other races is just incidental to the fact that we categorize people, and then they use that as a tool / avenue for their hatred. So why would we promote their tool for hatred? We don&#x27;t categorize people based on eye color, so why skin color?<p>The idea is not to lose identity and pretend we&#x27;re all the same, but rather to avoid explaining things with race. When someone behaves a certain way, or when someone can&#x27;t get a job, or got the job, the explanation should not include race, because it&#x27;s just not needed, it&#x27;s inaccurate, and it promotes the semantic tools for racist to leverage and keep hating.<p>I&#x27;m definitely open to why this is wrong, so corrections are more than welcome.",1454828139

For now I will stick to what I perceive to be the average of the various dictionary definitions of racism. By that meaning, not talking about or thinking about ethnicity is definitely not racism.<p>> if black children only ever see white people winning Oscars…they won’t believe that they themselves could win one ... Having visible role models is important.<p>I think you&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s important to have visible role models with the same ethnicity and/or sex, and/or whatever other bodily attribute we&#x27;re focusing on at the moment. But why would anyone think that unless they already have racist and/or sexist beliefs?",1454826335

Some people will say that because the users are a worldwide audience that the demographics of the product/service producer should reflect that demographic (so reflect the demographics of the user base rather than the more traditional local talent pool or population, regional talent pool or population, etc.<p>But I think people make these demands arbitrarily [or rather not, but whenever it benefits them].  So as an Irishwoman or an Indian man, I might not fret about the diversity of a product/service from Ireland or India, but then if a product or service from the US or Japan is used extensively in Ireland or India, I might insist on it having representation of my country/ethnicity.<p>You also don&#x27;t hear people saying, HonHai (Foxconn) should hire a more diverse workforce, or Xiomi [or even Lexus, for example] even though many of the products out put by these companies are used in diverse places.",1454826056

That is a question which has a lot of opinions but not a lot of data behind.<p>One way to study this might be to take a population which is on welfare, and for some of them replace their welfare with &#x27;one string attached&#x27; basic income. The string is that if they take the BI they cannot also take welfare. However any money they earn by working doesn&#x27;t affect how much BI they receive, it&#x27;s a constant. Then compare them against other people in the study who were left on welfare.<p>The goal would be to see how many BI recipents returned to work versus welfare recipients over 1, 2, and 5 year time spans. Trying to get a sample set in the 100 - 200 people range could be very expensive but it would help establish some data with which to analyze the question of whether or not people will work or not while getting basic income.",1454826027

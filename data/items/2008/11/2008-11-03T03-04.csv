Still have it installed: it was one of the few games, other than Civ2 and Pharoah and Lords of the Realm that I moved over. And I love it because it's so incredibly detailed. So intricate. Everything combines into everything else. And Spore PROMISED that. I was expecting to have to balance different types of flora to maintain the ecological balance on my planets. At the very least, I was expecting some very intricate classes. Because that's FUN. Always has been.<p>Spore was one-dimensional, start to finish. (Though I didn't play too far on the space stage: from there I'd lost interest.) There was no interaction. I wanted the first stage to be the simplest. I wanted rapid iteration of complexity. Something for everybody. I got none of that.<p>It's a shame, because the technology was so incredible. It just went into an awful game.",1225684706

I'm not trying to be snide -- I'm honestly interested.<p>The rent I'm talking about for Indy is downtown (not that it matters in indy). If I went to the Indy Suburbs, I could probably get it cheaper... Almost free probably for trade of some sort.<p>But driving in Chicago is a real pain, and I wouldnt want to live in the suburbs and/or have to commute there.",1225684550
351882,comment,351724,351724,0,0,dangrover,,,"The reason I was disappointed with Spore wasn't because it was fun at the expense of being scientifically inaccurate... it's because it wasn't all that fun period.<p>I enjoyed most of the Sim games because they give you a complex system with rules where every little decision has some slight impact on the way the game turns out. Part of winning is learning the rules to the system and strategizing (whether or not that system really reflect the reality of what it is ostensibly a simulation of).<p>There are too many things in Spore that don't make any difference in the gameplay. Most of the influence from one stage to the next is purely aesthetic or otherwise very limited. And everything except the Space stage was pretty simplistic with few opportunities for strategy.",1225684311

They just type company/product name right into Google search and hit enter. The others 9% type it into browser address bar, which in most cases lead to same result!

I'm leaving Indy at some point -- but it is very hard to move from Indy (low cost of living) to SFC or any coast (high cost of living).

He certainly appeals to Americans who respect those who

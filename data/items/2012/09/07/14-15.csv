4489403,comment,4488662,4488662,12,0,pash,,,"Yes, Google Fiber is subsidized. And that's a feature, not a bug.<p>Cable television and Internet service in the United States is lackluster and expensive partly because the market engenders little competition. (It's a classic example of a natural monopoly [0].) The high cost of building out a network is a formidable barrier to entry, one that incumbent providers have happily lain down behind and gone to sleep.<p>The way to fix this broken market is to facilitate competition, and one way to do that is to lower the start-up costs of companies that want to offer new and better services. That's precisely what Kansas City, Mo. and Kansas City, Kan. have done in their partnership with Google.<p>It's reasonable to question these cities' prudence in absorbing part of the very real, very substantial cost of building a fiber network from scratch. Whether it proves a wise investment will depend in large part on what they get out of the deal. But that includes free gigabit Internet for dozens of schools, libraries, community centers, and public buildings, plus the centerpiece of an effort to put Kansas City on the map as an attractive place to start and run a tech company. (That effort formally gets underway on Monday [1].)<p>I live in Kansas City, and I've signed up for Google Fiber. I'm here partly because I'm excited about what I'll be able to do with it, and what others will do with. So I'm biased, but it looks like a good investment to me.<p>0. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly</a><p>1. <a href=""http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2012/09/officials-set-to-unveil-strategic-tech-effort-launch-kc-at-monday-event"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2012/09/officials-set-to-u...</a>",1347029921

Some of the quotes in the article sounded like PR from cable or some other companies.<p>The biggest thing from a cost POV is the access to city building and utility pole rights of way. In most places, utility poles are owned by a combination telephone, power and cable utilities (or third parties), and these parties make it very difficult to run ""last mile"" cable by refusing lease space to third parties, or making it extremely expensive to do so. Many municipal broadband initiatives have died as a result of this.<p>So Kansas City allowed Google to use it's rights of way, buildings, or leased pole space to run cabling. And it allowed a few employees to use excess city office space, and provide some marketing support.<p>Big whoop. Kansas City made some modest concessions available to make a important service available to its citizens.<p>The usual subsidy story is different. My city, like many others, indirectly subsidizes the cable company by giving them a monopoly on wired television service.

4489210,comment,4488561,4488561,34,0,nkohari,,,"My Hacker News account is 1859 days old (just over 5 years). Over those 5 years, I've gone through several stages of my entrepreneurial career.<p>HN has been there from the time when I just was dreaming about launching a startup, through the gut check when I finally quit my full-time job to found a startup, selling that startup to another company, being fired by that company, and finally joining a friend's startup as CTO. I've changed throughout, and I've seen Hacker News change as well.<p>The problem I have witnessed with Hacker News is that over the years, it's transformed from a place where civil and intelligent discourse can be had to a place where each comment seems to be made for show. Rather than making solid arguments, each person seems to want to be seen as more intelligent than the rest of the commenters. This phenomena is the reason for what in my opinion is a breathtaking level of pedantry about the most mundane topics.<p>For example, there was a post on the front page yesterday about scalability at GitHub. It was an interesting and insightful article from a knowledgeable author. The top comment was something along the lines of, ""I can't believe they wasted so much time making the UI look this good."" HN used to be a place where insightful articles were rewarded with intelligent conversation and debate. What happened?<p>Another example. Someone launched a site earlier this week involving the sales of hobbyist electronics. The site was definitely interesting, and they experienced a large volume of traffic from HN and Reddit. The top comment? Something along the lines of, ""when a startup can't keep its site up, it makes me question their abilities."" HN used to be a site where you would be congratulated for launching. What happened?<p>It's this kind of stuff that has to go. I don't think Hacker News was ever perfect -- and maybe I'm just rooting for the site because of the potential that it has -- but it's definitely gotten worse over the past few years.<p>As a community, we need to stop the posturing and the pedantry, and get back to civil and intelligent discourse. We also need to act as the site's immune system, and stop promoting content that is clearly written to be seen but adds nothing to the conversation.",1347028010

I like the auto-complete feature on the search, though it seems to be on titles and not on movie tags?<p>2. Under ""economics"" there are two RBS videos.  This made me wonder how videos/docs are selected.  Perhaps putting a how docs are selected link would be good.<p>3. I clicked on ""Submit"" and it tells me that I should log in.  Which means that I then have to make the extra step to go and click on the log in button.  Perhaps you take me to the log in screen immediately if I'm not logged in with the same type of flash message?  That way it saves me one click and it's functionality that I would expect.<p>4. As you have ads on your site on the right hand side, what if you included them as tiles in the doc tiling?  That way i'm more likely to look at them and it will let the very right hand column move up so you can put more information there.<p>5. Below each doc description, perhaps you can put how many times the page has been clicked into?  It would definitely help me take a look at some that might not be my immediate taste if I see that it's the one page that has been visited the most.<p>6.

Until they have a collision with reality they then to simply parrot what was driven into their heads because that's all they know.<p>On the business end, there are a lot of people posting on HN that have never actually started or run a real business, leased space and equipment, hired and fired, had to deal with the various corrupt liberal labor boards, had to deal with taxation and regulation, the agony of business problems and the exhilaration of business success and a myriad of other real-world forces that a business has to face on a daily basis.  Yet, they'll come to HN and think that because they read the internet they understand business.<p>All of this is OK to some degree or another.  As I said, it's human nature and this is a group of human beings.<p>I like HN and want it to remain a high-quality source of interesting discussions relevant to the tech entrepreneur (and not just about which LISP is better!).

Your Karma is basically how much votes you get to give.\nIf someone makes a good post, people upvote it, spending their precious karma. The person made the post, collects the karma and and they can use it to vote other posts.\nWe can limit karma by having new users start off with 0. And they only way they can vote/get karma is to contribute positively with quality articles/posts.\nNow it works the other way too. Make downvoting take away karma of the OP too, thus making people put more thought into their posts. The downvoting action will cost a vote, so people don't running around downvoting everything without thinking.\nBasically let Karma/Vote be a resource that can be used to promote positive contribution and dissuade useless contributions.\nThe tricky part is balancing the karma in the whole system. Downvoting siphons votes/karma from the system, we need a way to introduce additional karma/votes into the system. Maybe a monthly replenish method where say everyone gets 10 votes each month. But in order to qualify for the monthly bonus, you must first contribute enough (get the up votes) past a certain threshold (say 100 upvotes to your posts/contributions).""",1347027580

You could make the same argument about every video game system - it's less than ideal because you have to buy video games for it. This isn't because nintendo is evil or lazy, it's just how the system works. A video game system is a device for consuming other peoples' video games (and nintendo's too, if they want), and the kindle fire is a device for consuming other peoples' books.<p>Why is android less than ideal, because it's ad supported? You could say the same thing about facebook, twitter, and every other company out there that provides a free service supported by ads. Some people don't like this, and this leads to developments like app.net - we'll see how paid services like this do over the next couple of years. But the fact remains that if you don't realize when you sign up for a free service that people are being paid to make that they need to make money somehow, you aren't even thinking.<p>Then let's move on to all of apple's major devices. You get a iphone, but this relies on a contract with a service provider, which is in fact how apple makes most of their money off iphones. Oh no - immoral!<p>Or you may buy an ipod, apple's other big product. But what's an ipod without music on it from a third party. Hold up - third party pollution, the ipod is no good as a product.<p>Or perhaps you buy the only other thing they sell, a computer. But you'd better not put any software on it from a third party, because then it's just a means to an end, not an end in itself.<p>Overall, I understand the general idea, but this was very poorly thought out and needs more thinking and explanation, not to mention that at least to me, the statement about Apple's products all being an ""end"" is definitely false.",1347027261

In years past, all my 'alternative' friends would throw out all kinds of wild statements on how their treatments would work, safe in knowledge that it had not been conclusively disproved. Now that the gray area they reside in is being shut down, I've noticed a lot more lately that conversations end with ""well, I just do it for the placebo affect"". I never really noticed how often I hear this until I read the article. And now that even that gray area is being shut down, it makes me wonder what special pleading is going to be next.",1347026974

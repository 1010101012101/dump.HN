Pushing a new simplistic website to a LAMP (default one click installed), has as much difficulty as pushing files to a directory (/var/www). Even if Visual Studio gives a one-button-system, I would still not call that a killer feature over placing files in a directory.<p>When one pick between WAMP and LAMP, the question one should ask is if a) what framework matches best with the developers skill/knowledge and what features the site is going to have, b) what performance requirements are there, and c) what legacy code will have to run along side.

If you have a parent or grandparent born in a European country, take your birth certificate with you and try and get local citizenship along with a passport. Almost everybody I had met while travelling had done this.<p>Check the websites for the various consulates, embassies and travel advice from your home country to find out what you can and can't do. Also remember that in many second and third world countries the written rules and the real rules are two different things - this is how I came to get a third passport in Serbia for $10 which I used to get into Hungary (legally, this time) in the summer season.<p>There are also special type of visa, for eg. with an Australian passport you can easily (meaning, just an application) get a 2 year working holiday visa in the UK<p>For everywhere else where you have Visa waivers, what I would do is use it as an excuse to get away to another country and come back in. I did this in order to stay in South Africa for 2+ years. Never had any problems getting the visa renewed each time.<p>It all depends on which passport you carry. I am fortunate enough to have an Australian passport, but there are other western passports that are good with Visa issues.<p>Flights in Europe and Asia are very cheap, lots of established low cost carriers.<p>The other tip is that even in the most expensive cities in the world you can find shared accommodation with enough space for a bed, desk and internet connection for a few hundred dollars a week. Just ask around. That type of accommodation is usually clustered around suburbs, for eg. Acton and Shepherds Bush in London.<p>I really should do what Alex has done here and write some blog posts with tips and experiences.",1354088556
4841467,comment,4839502,4841153,2,0,SiVal,,,"Thanks for responding. This is food for thought and may be encouraging. We ""just jumped on Python 3.0 shortly after release"" and have been using it without a glitch for four years. I don't doubt your claim about Python 3.0's ""readiness for production"", though, because workstation number and text crunching ""production"" and high-volume web ""production"" are so different, but (in addition to other languages) we've been using Python3 as our only Python for years with no (known) problems.<p>I'd prefer to start doing webdev in Python3, too, as long as we can just work in Python3 without having our framework's (or our framework's vast, tortured userbase's) endless upgrade problems become our problems. We have no Python2 legacy baggage of our own, and I have no desire to go back and pick up anybody else's.<p>So when, approximately, will Django 1.6 ship, with ""no reservations"" about Python3 for production?<p>And do you have an estimate for when Django will deprecate Python2 entirely, so that Python3 programmers will become the assumed target for all features, docs, tutorials, code snippet examples, add-on modules, etc?",1354088535

4841423,comment,4839436,4840223,1,0,beemoe,,,"""any UI behavior that requires waiting seems pretty dubious to me...""<p>Deep down I really agree with that, but I become conflicted when I consider settings with severe limitations that have little else to turn to.  For example: the timed hover to select on some Kinect games: touch screens that use longpress as a substitute for right-click; touchscreen keyboards with longpress as a shift-like behavior.  It somehow seems regretfully acceptable when dealing with the limitations of a touch screen, single button, or no button environment.<p>One case where I think it is ok to require waiting are ""Ejector seat button next to the radio"" type situations where user action could have potentially disastrous consequences: I am glad I have to hold down my power button for some time to force a hardware restart.",1354087489

9372929,comment,9372303,9372303,0,0,jonpress,,,"The root of the eventloop issue is not Node-specific. The real underlying issue here is that one CPU core is given too much work while others are more or less idle. Offloading some of the work to another process naturally solves this issue - It doesn&#x27;t really matter that this other process is a Go program or a Node.js one - Both approaches would have solved the problem. Attributing credit to Go itself for solving the issue is disingenuous.<p>If you ran Go as a single thread, you would also run into similar issues. The main advantage of Go is that it makes it easier to parallelize your code thanks to goroutines and channels (a single source file can encapsulate the logic of multiple concurrent processes).<p>That said, I find that this &#x27;ease of concurrency&#x27; makes Go code less readable. In Node.js, it&#x27;s really easy to identify process boundaries since the child_process module forces you to put code into different files and communicate via loosely coupled IPC channels.<p>Most of the Node.js vs Go arguments are weak. It&#x27;s surprising that Node.js is still outpacing Go in popularity in spite of all this slander.",1429001830

However, the comment that he knows that Bernard does not know the date is significant.  This means that whatever date Bernard has been told, it must show up in at least two months.  This rules out May and June, since both of those months have unique dates.<p>Now, Bernard knows that the month is July or August, and based on this information, he says he can deduce the month.  This means that it cannot be the 14th as that date occurs in both July and August.  We are left with the  options of July 16, August 15, and August 17.<p>Finally, Albert tells us that based on the information Bernard gave, he was able to deduce the exact date.  If the month he was told was August, he would have no way to determine between the 15th and the 17th.

They have an unemployment tax/insurance… and is based on how many employees have become unemployed from you. It would be pretty easy to consider this to be quite low in a company that pays above-market.<p>The maximum is around 5.84% But seems the average is around 1% or less.<p>Medicare is 1.45% from employer (the additional 0.9% on amounts of $200k don&#x27;t really count here).<p>Social Security is 6.2%<p>So my total tax rate was off, but it still seems to be around 8.65%. Even less if their unemployment insurance figure is lower.<p>By the way, there were only 70 employees that were going to get an increase in salary. Hence my estimates of people who would be under $70k at all. I took what I thought would be the lowest figure for employees in a company like this (as well as the doubling comment in the original article) and estimated the total maximum increase at $35k to $70k (even though the actual increase <i>will</i> be lower).<p>Not that our figures are really that different in that case. My $2.45m increase versus your $2.6m. Plus an extra 8.65% tax ($220k).<p>You also mention that this is a highly competitive market. You&#x27;re right, but it&#x27;s also one that scales disproportionally compared to staffing. What do you think Stripe & PayPal in San Francisco pay their staff? 
I&#x27;m heavily involved in the finance sector (in AU anyway) and I can assure you that these businesses (especially in the USA) have significant margins on their average retail fees. 2.9% + 30¢ might seem like a great deal to most of everyone on here, but their top-line margins are > 30% on that, moreso for small transactions, as that 30¢ fee doesn&#x27;t really exist anywhere but the gateway.<p>As an example (in AU), a business doing mediocre credit-card volumes of < $1m/year will be paying less than 0.4% + the Visa/Mastercard interchange fees (which is about 0.33% for the vast majority of card types… 1.023% for platinum cards).",1429000666

My fiction is they&#x27;re embarrassed to show their junk so they use a stall. They don&#x27;t lift the seat and they pee all over it. Once in a while I see someone use the stall when all the urinals are full but more often than not there are free urinals but the guy still wants to pee on the toilet. Giving him the benefit of the doubt he doesn&#x27;t pick up the seat because he doesn&#x27;t want to touch it. But that just seems symptomatic of the &quot;me first&quot; American culture. Screw everyone else.<p>The #2 most common issue is broken stalls. The stalls in the USA are almost universally poorly designed. They have an 8 inch gap at the bottom and often are hanging from the ceiling. They are exceedingly easy to break or bend and the locks for the stalls have at most 2mm of tolerance so any bending means they don&#x27;t stay open. Worse (and it happens often) is when they barely stay closed so I get in, close, lock, pull down pants, sit on toilet in my most vulnerable moment and someone else closes a door in another stall and my door opens.<p>The #3 most common issue is stuffing / clogging the toilet. I can&#x27;t tell if people do this by accident or on purpose. There are sometimes signs up that say &quot;please don&#x27;t put non TP in the toilet&quot;. Others that say if you have to use a lot of paper please flush the toilet often.<p>As far as I can tell American&#x27;s take this stuff for granted. That&#x27;s just how it is.<p>But it&#x27;s not! In Scandinavia and areas near by I saw immaculate public restrooms. They might have cost $0.50 but they had full floor to ceiling doors with sturdy walls. Some even had their own private individual sink.<p>Japan public restrooms also almost always have doors that at least go all the way to the floor and usually aren&#x27;t destroyed like USA ones. Subway restrooms in Japan in general are not the cleanest but they are usually functional which is not true, at least in my experience, of many USA public restrooms.<p>As for #1 I wish someone like Adam Sandberg would figure out a comic meme that made it un-macho for men to pee in stalls. I guess I assume if it was funny enough and popular enough then it would be more embarrassing to pee on a toilet than use the urinal and that would fix #1.<p>I have no idea how to fix #2 or #3 though.",1428998704

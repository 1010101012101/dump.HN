383941,comment,382911,383925,0,0,KirinDave,,,"<i>The end result (Macro-Evolution) cannot be empirically observed in action.</i><p>Neither can God.<p>I do feel bad for you, kirse. 10 years ago I went through the same dilemma, debate and denial. If you want to be rational, you have to learn the evidence. If you learn the evidence and you apply rational, even-handed criterion to the subject, the conclusion that evolution exists and at least partly explains our modern world is undeniably apparent.<p>You literally have no rational leg to stand on. Your argument that the conclusion was made up and the data forced to fit it is so obviously false that it's almost laughable (few theories are as rigorously opposed as evolution has been, if there were any significant holes the scientific community would tear it apart).<p><i>This isn't about whether the evidence points to the end result, it's about whether or not we even have the right end result in mind.</i><p>This is exactly 180 degrees from reality. If the evidence points to a specific conclusion and that evidence can be replicated by diverse, neutral, competent observers the conclusion is true regardless of if we like it or not. Science isn't about picking a result then gathering data to support it, although if you hang out with the ID crowd I can see why you might get that impression.<p>If you want an example we can look again to heliocentricity.  It was not a popular viewpoint, but the data forced people to accept that position, despite the fact that it went against all the contemporary common sense and religious belief (and despite the fact that it's difficult to observe contrary evidence without a lot of bookkeeping and some optics).<p>P.S. I didn't answer your question earlier because I've already answered a very similar question in debates dozens of times. Your crowd really needs a revised playbook, because you can basically google ever question as presented and get a powerful rebuttal to your every potential argument.",1228272833

Thanks.<p>On nagging about India, I have felt it myself esp with one controversial debate that happened over Chandrayaan post. I do have good words but it has just so happened that there is more to whine about day-to-day feeling helpless (just how u explained in a comment above) than feel good or hopeful.<p>I chose to start a venture in India instead of moving to the US or Europe like my many friends did in the name of higher education, then job.<p>I do whatever good I can do for the country within my capabilities - helping people at individual levels to rise up. As you might have noted I do get highly opinionated and get into lot of trouble even government officials. So I see myself probably not smart enough with getting things across in a nice way, hence incapable of bringing a change at large.<p>Yes, we need a revolution.

383917,comment,383108,383347,0,0,rapind,,,"I think we're being a little harsh in this case and really overstating <i>never optimize prematurely</i> like it's some kind of religion.<p>Optimization is built in to most web stacks. Database caching for example. For rails this is convention over configuration when you're running with the production flag. Plus there's all sorts of other optimizations going on at every level, because it's suspected that even if a lot of applications don't need them, to not bake them in will cripple and add undo complexity to other apps. This adds tons of complexity, but it's well abstracted. And many of our apps don't need this... so it's premature definitely, but it's a pretty fast and fun stack to build with.<p>I think it is completely acceptable to perform certain types of optimization, even prematurely perhaps, provided the cost of these optimizations is low if you think there's a decent chance, or have a hunch that you could get into trouble if you don't. Experience teaches you which assumptions to make, but it's definitely not a perfect science. Sometimes you overdo it and there's a cost, but there's also a cost if you underestimate as well. It's an effort we make as developers to balance between the two.<p>So in this scenario, caching some pages to me sounds pretty acceptable, or at least border line. He implemented the caching in a very simple, basic, and well known <i>commonly accepted</i> way. No memcached or anything fancy, just static page dumps. He's running on a 256 VPS slice, which is pretty slim for a business, so it's not too hard to imagine he'd run into problems if there was even a small spike in traffic. Plus, his traffic is decent. I for one would probably have cached as well, at least the landing pages anyways.<p>He got in trouble sure, and as a direct result of his caching, but these things happen when you're running everything yourself. I don't think it's due to bad judgment.<p>This reminds me of another statement that is often taken to the extreme. ""Launch quick and get it in front of people. Don't assume you know what your users want."" I think it's a pretty good reminder once you start to go too far, but of course we all know you still need to make many assumptions just so you have a product. There's not much value in the canvas alone. These little gems like ""Never optimize prematurely"" won't do your job for you. The reality is too fuzzy, and that's why you get paid.<p>I hope this doesn't sound like a harsh reply. I do agree that there are many cases where people go crazy with optimization, features, etc, and it's good to have a little mantra like ""Never this, never that"". I just don't think he's guilty of any of these in this case is all. The cron was a blunder many of us have experienced. It cost him though, and he's learned that lesson well now I bet. I always learn best from my most costly mistakes.",1228271530

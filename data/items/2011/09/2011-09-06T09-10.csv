Hunt-and-peckers don't stand a chance when your keys are mismatched.

Sure, once you know it's option-3 it's not so bad, but I don't know how you're meant to just figure that out for yourself.<p>And the thing is, it's all just gratuitous.

The ribbon appears to be designed for this, with the option to present a less optimal interface for smaller screens by a combination of resizing interface elements and eliminating uncommonly used ones.<p>Try resizing the Ribbon all the way from super-wide (if you've got dual monitors, it's particularly interesting) to really narrow. It's quite fun to watch, especially in Office products with zillions of interface controls - the giant buttons and large scrollable boxes full of options become groups of smaller buttons with text, then even smaller buttons without text, then collapse into a single menu, before disappearing altogether into the 'more' button.",1315301719

It takes work, even for a man, to not become fat, smelly, and overly hairy.<p>I think the underlying cause for women to focus too much on appearances is because it is much easier for women, in current society, to marry into wealth and/or depend on a man. I think this has a much larger influence on women focusing more on their appearances than behavioral conditioning through constant complimenting.<p>The compliment is a signal. If the person is pretty and you say that, then it's a proper signal. If you tell a child they are smart because they did some random thing, it's not necessarily a proper signal. Sending a wrong signal is bad. In the case of telling a child s/he's smart when s/he's not, the child may not try as hard anymore because s/he may wrongfully think s/he's smart enough already... In the case of telling someone s/he's pretty, as long as it's true, there's nothing wrong with it because being pretty can actually have practical advantages.

At the same time, girls themselves get into peer pressure easily. Very quickly in their lives they get the feeling that in order to be 'looked at' you have to be beautiful. I am not saying that guys don't suffer from this, but girls suffer from this more than guys.<p>Its like the TV channels competing for TRP's. The demand for a something good exists, but the fact is that the demand is fueled by the content providers and not viewers.<p>Now on a larger scale, the society doesn't dumb down girls. Its just the mere biological reasons prevent them from doing so many jobs that are common for men. Women have higher social pressures, physically and biologically they have more limitations when compared to men. They have bigger social pressures to deal with. All in all, this counts for most of the reasons why women don't get the <i>incremental learning</i> at the same rate as men.<p>Now come to look at the other part of it, there is huge difference between looking good/presentable and wild chase for beauty. Cosmetic products exist both for men and women, but their nature differ. Apart from your usual set of deodorants and usual kit et al, you don't mascara or lipstick for men. Not that such a thing is not desirable for men, but its just that men won't chase it at all.<p>Ultimately you truly get what you want.",1315301631

Some of these statements are from my own perspective, others from complete newcomers to clojure that I've talked to or worked with:<p>1) Most of the time I resort to reading the actual source.<p>2) There are many libraries which have native clojure documentation on each function, but lack a website summarizing it.<p>3) Trying to figure out how all the various web components fit together is very time consuming.<p>3.1) How do ring sessions handle security? (they default to a memory store, but you need to dig to find this, I don't know if the cookie store uses encyrption)<p>3.2) ClojureQL is still in heavy development, but the documentation is lacking answers to many frequently asked questions. EG:<p>3.3) How does one execute a series of statements in a transaction?<p>3.4) How does one retrieve the id of the record just inserted?<p>There are answers. For the first, you can use clojure.java.jdbc, or clojure.contrib.sql, given some constraints. For the second, you can't, but the latest dev snapshot can.<p>3.5) How do you execute arbitrary SQL? (you can in batch with jdbc, but not all statements work in batch)<p>3.6) session expiry, a critical feature. But you need to dig to find hozumi/session-expiry. Also, it doesn't work with sandbar's stateful sessions in my experience. All not documented.<p>3.7) security restrictions are another huge problem for clojure web frameworks. Sandbar's are ok, but still limited and not particularly performant. I'll try to get some code released soon on this front.<p>3.8) Understanding how ring and it's requests work is a challenge. There should probably be a small book chapter explaining the architecture of this. I understand it, but it took a lot of reading on mailing lists and ultimately the source code to figure it out.<p>4) Beyond documentation. Clojure web frameworks are based on composing many small components. This is great and has many strengths beyond those of other frameworks. However, a lot of users are looking for a turnkey ""do this, do that"" solution. They want to know the best standard practice. This is process, something that gives strengths to frameworks like Ruby on Rails.<p>While I would not suggest abandoning the composability of clojure web frameworks, having a standardized large scale framework with standardized process would go a long way to getting more widespread adoption.<p>For example, a framework with recommendations for large scale code organisation like model view controller, or similar functional equivalents, along with recommendations for standardized modules and coding practices.<p>Webnoir is still too much of a micro framework to handle these needs. We don't need to abandon flexibility and composability. However, there needs to be a manual of best practices along with code that makes it easy to use for common web app development, all details included.<p>Above all, a central resource tying all these points together is what is needed. I too want to help with this.",1315300916

Most of the time you don't need your own collection classes, or new types that work like functions.

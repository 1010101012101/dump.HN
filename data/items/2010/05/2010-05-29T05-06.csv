What I mean is, take for instance a cloud based provider like Rackspace, which offers bandwidth for 20 cents per GB. Now say you have a default home page that is roughly half a meg in size, which when you account for all of the doohikies in the Web 2.0 era, is not totally out of the question. With those 2 variables in place, you're spending 20 cents for every ~2050 visitors.<p>Do the current online advertising rates cover the costs or would this be losing money in terms of bandwidth costs? Put aside all other costs for the moment. Perhaps the better question is, what kind of advertising scenario would be needed to even break even in such a scenario?",1275112646

1388409,story,,,2,1,niktech,"Ask HN: Using 5-drive RAID 0 array as another cache layer",,"I recently started using Intel Matrix Storage RAID solution that allowed me to use my 5 1TB drives for two RAID volumes. First one a 1TB RAID 0 striped across all 5 drives and second one a RAID 5 across the rest of the free space on all drives (around 2.85TB usable space).<p>The RAID 0 I use for OS, applications and games while the RAID 5 I use as a more-permanent type storage (photos, projects, etc). Now I do realize that running the OS and applications on RAID 0 across 5 drives is very dangerous, which is what brings up the following question.<p>Is there a reliable freeware realtime backup application that can backup a set of folders from one drive to another drive (no online backups needed)? I've already tried a few (Mozy, Yadis, Comodo Backup, GFI Backup, Idoo, Crash Plan) but none meet my requirements:<p>- Low CPU and RAM usage.<p>- Realtime Backups: as soon as a file is modified in the source folder, it is added to the backup queue which will be processed with the lowest priority when the CPU is idle. This backup queue should persist in cases of computer restarts and crashes (ie: the source and destination folders should always have the same set of files, except for the ones waiting in the backup queue).<p>- Incremental Backups: if only 10 bytes changed in a 1GB file, the app should only copy those 10 new bytes.<p>- Ability to back up locked and opened files (some apps, like Yadis, can't back up critical files like browser favorites).<p>- Ability to run as a service (no need for any user to log-in to have the app started).<p>Optional requirements:<p>- Compression of the destination into a well-known format (RAR, Zip) that can be directly read without the use of the application.<p>- Preset source folders (such as Browser Favorites, Game Saves, Application Settings, etc).<p>The idea is to use RAID 0 array as ""semi-persistent RAM-like"" storage which in case of a failure can be quickly rebuilt by reinstalling the OS, apps, games and copying over the settings, saves, favorites from RAID 5. I'm also thinking of taking this RAID 0 as RAM idea to the extreme with SSDs (as soon as we get some nice 6Gb/s SATA III SSDs out there), where a couple of SSDs chained in RAID 0 will work as yet another semi-persistent cache layer sitting between the RAM and the HD and serving all file requests for the OS, games, apps, etc.<p>Ideally, I need an application (or a loopback driver) that would convert any disk volume into a write-back, read-through cache backed by another disk volume as permanent store. If such an application doesn't exist, I'm thinking of writing one.",1275111396

What you should be concerned about is whether or not the address <i>works</i> (and usually, can/does the person who just signed up actually read and reply to email to that address).<p>Hypothetically, if an invalid address works (due to bugs in mail systems) -- then it works, and the only problem with accepting such an address is that the bugs might get fixed. If an address is valid, there's no reason to assume that it will work or that it belongs to the person who signed up.

1388405,comment,1386772,1387715,0,0,Kadin,,,"I mean that the implementation is not a true feature, but a quasi-bug in disguise.<p>This definition sums up my use of the term fairly well (<a href=""http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/misfeature"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/misfeature</a>):<p>>A feature that eventually causes lossage, possibly because it is not adequate for a new situation that has evolved. Since it results from a deliberate and properly implemented feature, a misfeature is not a bug. Nor is it a simple unforeseen side effect; the term implies that the feature in question was carefully planned, but its long-term consequences were not accurately or adequately predicted...<p>At some point, someone must have thought that allowing JavaScript access to the clipboard would be a neat idea.  And on a whiteboard, it <i>does</i> seem like a neat idea.  But in the extremely hostile environment of the Internet, where every feature <i>will be abused</i> in the most user-hostile ways possible, it is a liability rather than an asset.<p>The Internet has a long history of such features: the ability of a page to spawn new windows, which led to popups, is the one of the most glaring to casual users, but Usenet's  CANCEL messages and the ensuing Hipcrime debacle is IMO more to the point.<p>The prevailing attitude when developing desktop operating systems, which provide tools to developers under the assumption that they will be reasonably careful with them ('with great power comes great responsibility'), fails completely on the Internet.  On the desktop, you can assume that obviously flawed, hostile software will get eliminated by the market -- a few people might get burned, but then nobody will install it, problem solved.  On the Internet, this doesn't work; if you release a browser with a ""feature"" that can be exploited to take advantage of users or even to merely annoy them, it <i>will</i> be used, and it won't just be used a few times, it will be used over, and over, and over ... until the feature is hardened or removed (e.g. the BLINK tag, early ActiveX).<p>I am very concerned that the rush to provide desktop-application-like capabilities to web apps will open a huge can of worms in terms of the new avenues for abuse that it allows, and the overall effect of this -- when the abuse happens in spades, which it will -- will be to cause users to disable those features globally, and distrust web apps in general.",1275111201

So the impact on actual investment is likely to be close to zero, even if there are reduced incentives to <i>being</i> a VC.  Look at it this way - if a plague struck and killed one of every 10 VCs, chances are that the amount of capital wouldn't radically change - it would just mostly get reallocated among the survivors (I'm sure it would change in some marginal case, it might depend a bit on who the affected VCs were, etc.)",1275110603

There have existed people who lose themselves in games (among other things) to the detriment of their ""real life"" from way back.  Forgive me for dredging this up:<p><a href=""http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YswmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KAIGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6894,3927015&hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=YswmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=K...</a><p>So that's the question that has to be answered -- if there have been 500 billion hours of WoW played (just my random guess) in the last five years and 500 million hours of Rubik's Cube played in the 80's, is Ernö Rubik also equivalent to a drug dealer, just in smaller proportions?  Finally, maybe WoW is keeping guys from even less productive internet addictions, like, say, editing TV Tropes.<p>So I think I need to understand the moral line drawn in the too-successful argument.  Because otherwise I just see WoW as the current bête noire analogous to any other popular diversion, like video arcades were 20 or 30 years ago.  Is there a substantive difference, or is it merely quantitative?<p>Now the argument that does resound with me, as well as most game designers I know, is that designers are making gameplay that basically abuses the player without enhancing their experience of the game.<p>Some people have pointed at the simplicity of the gameplay in WoW (i.e. questing is too easy) and said that it's abusive to make simple gameplay compelling.  I personally find this bizarre.  Abusive gameplay is an area where I hold Valve, Blizzard, PopCap and others fairly blameless.  That's not entirely surprising for one reason: their customers pay for the game.  A fine player experience is what they hope will create more customers.<p>With many social gaming experiences, players have come to expect abuse, which is a crying shame.  That they will be tantalized, guilted, used to spam their friends, inconvenienced and annoyed.  Is any of that core to the game itself?  No, the proof being that in most cases if you pay, it goes away.  It's beyond just breaching the editorial wall -- the lame way that marketing is integrated into gameplay is what makes pro game designers howl with disgust.<p>P.S. Anyone interested in investing in a startup that breaks social gaming out of these shackles, please email.",1275109335

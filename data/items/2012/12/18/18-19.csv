With convertible notes, the early owners retain control and there's less risk for the investor. If everything goes well, the early investors get in on a ""proven"" success. If things go sour, there's still some chance of debt being repaid in a bankruptcy. Also, there's less pressure all around, as early investors can opt to just have their debt paid off, so they aren't anxiously waiting for the next round of funding or a liquidity event.",1355857142

The fact that they couldn't find the collision detector implies that the code had no class named CollisionDetector, no procedure named DetectCollisions, nothing of the sort.  Which implies (if not conclusively) that there was a whole lot spaghetti code floating around in there.

Nothing about writing a spec prevents you from prototyping and iterating, though. These are not competing ideas.<p>Of course you won't get everything right in the first draft of the spec. You won't get everything right in the first release of your software either. That's not an excuse to stop trying.<p>Let's suppose you write a spec, then go on to write some code. For each design problem that makes you break from your original plans, one of two things is true:<p>(1) Someone noticed a problem while writing or reviewing the spec, and changed the design. You've saved a ton of time over implementing the wrong thing and then changing it later.<p>(2) You didn't notice the problem until implementation. It still takes just as long to fix as it would have if you hadn't bothered writing a spec first.<p>If #1 is common enough, writing the spec saves you time. At worst, #1 never happens and you're out the time it took to write the spec. But how long does that take? In my experience, it takes a lot less time to write a spec than to actually implement it.<p>There's a lot of potential upside and little potential downside.<p>I don't advocate Epic Design Up Frontat some point, it's time to stop planning and start doing. But I do advocate Some Design Up Front, as opposed to Let's Wing It And Hope For The Best.<p>> Software should <i>be</i> the spec.<p>Software is not a spec. It's written in computerspeak so only the programmers can read it, and sometimes they're not even completely sure what's going on. Without a spec, QA has nothing to test against, so you get into arguments about how things should work because there's no record of any decision on the matter. There's nothing to write documentation against, so the documentation ends up worthless. Sales and marketing make up all sorts of neat features you get to implement whether they make sense or not because they've already been sold, and you can't really say they should've known better because you never bothered to write down what they should know in the first place.<p>If all you have is code, you don't have a spec.

Its that your models end up becoming arbitrary bags of logic whose contents lack rhyme or reason.<p>Let me unpack that claim.<p>In the models-and-controllers view of the world, theres no obviously good place to represent the <i>relationships</i> between models. The relationship logic usually ends up getting stuffed into controllers (making them fat) or into arbitrarily designated models (making them chubby). For a long time now, though, everyone has been told to keep their controllers skinny, so now most of this logic ends up in models. And so we get a lot of chubby models these days.<p>Example time.<p>Say you have employees, who have roles at companies, which own assets. Youll have a model class for each of these real-world concepts: Employee, Role, Company, Asset. So far, so good.<p>Now say you need a way to determine whether a given employee should be allowed to sell a given asset. Well, the answer to that question depends on the role that the employee has at the company that owns the asset. So where do you put the logic that answers the question?<p>Some people would put it in the Employee class, so they can write employee.can_sell?(asset). Others would put it on the Asset class, so they can write asset.sellable_by?(employee). Others would mix it into controller logic somewhere, because thats where the employee and asset objects interact. And yet others would create a separate module of permissions logic to house the interaction, so they can write permissions.has_sell_on?(employee, asset).<p>If you choose to put that kind of relationship logic into a model class, and lots of people do, odds are youll make the same decision again and again. And, in time, your models will get chubby.<p>The problem is that, after a while, your models get bloated up with logic about <i>other</i> models and become harder to reason about.",1355854980

Of course it sucks if you get undercut, or your product gets cloned. And you can't rely on your market to know the history and do the right thing.<p>The saving grace, and why Matthieu's post is horse shit, is that software is a lot like art. People don't want clones. They want Plants vs. Zombies not a clone. It's music, it's art, and guarding your secrets about how you make your art is unhealthy.<p>One of the things you get, too, is influence and respect from your peers. Pierre certainly has mine. He's put together an excellent resource for those who want to follow in his footstep writing and selling apps having realistic expectations about what it takes, and some great links to resources for doing things like promotion. It's still a lot of hard work, clearly, but he's increasing the size of his community, not giving away the <i>secret sauce</i>.",1355854858

4938667,comment,4937621,4938439,7,0,martinced,,,"Strawman: you're reducing differences between languages to semantical differences and that's simply not correct.<p>Someone already mentioned immutability.  Another example is sound concurrency support: a language which is using non-blocking synchronization is not going to have threads constantly blocked monitoring locks (I'm not talking about Scala particularly: but in Java the language, the ""synchronized"" SNAFU is really totally messed up if you've done any serious concurrent programming and it's <i>very</i> hard to get ""right"").<p>Then another example it's also a fact that crazy optimization can be achieved by using macro pre-processing at compile-time.  Java the language doesn't offer this.  It's actually so problematic in certain cases that there have been specific tools developed (e.g. by Nokia for accessing the J2ME Nokia API) that did <i>add</i> macro support to Java.<p>Another example where macro do shine: an API like trove, using primitives-backed maps/set, runs circles around, say, a normal HashMap{Integer,Long}.  But Java cannot automate/duplicate the code needed to offer this for all the primites types (which, some may argue, is precisely the reason why such performant maps/sets have never been part of the stock Java APIs).  So how do you do if you want to ""run around circle"" of these default totally lame HashMap{Long,Integer} like if you're say, the Trove author?  You write your own code generator generating all the .java files needed from a template.  Pretty cool (from the Trove author) but also pretty lame (from ""Java the language"").<p>With real macros this one is a no-brainer.  So much for ""semantics"".<p>These are just two examples: you're belief that language differences can be resumed to semantics is incorrect.",1355854025

4938652,comment,4933656,4936055,6,0,nsomaru,,,"I think use of that acronym itself constitutes geekiness ;)<p>A bit of background: I've spent the last three years of my life studying Indian metaphysics in India at a traditional academy known as an 'ashram'. The environment was somewhat similar to the original Greek academies, I can imagine, but that is speculation. I also have interests in tech, programming and philosophy. Please note that I am not trying to 'prove anything' either correct or incorrect -- indeed, this would not be the forum to do so. Rather, an opportunity to be of service to another individual and present two different views of this experience of the world and thus life itself.<p>For the western mind, indeed, for my mind -- it is ingrained to a point of 'truth' that there is a single objective world around us which presents itself to various individuals via the senses. It literally took me 1.5 years of serious mental deconstruction, analysis and questioning before I was able to entertain the thought that my body, brain and indeed the world around me were a _product_ of the mind, and did not produce the mind itself. Consider that. It's your whole system of thinking about the world turned upside down.<p>In building a metaphysical system for the world and individual, the Indians defined an individual as a 'body-mind-intellect' (BMI) experiencing 'perceptions-emotions-thoughts' (PET). The former they termed the 'relative subject' and the latter the 'relative object'. It is easy to see that these cover EVERY aspect of human experience.<p>I am taking a shortcut and would be happy to clarify further, but there is a facet of the spiritual path in India known as bhakti yoga (the science of union with the Divine through emotion) which targets the mind in its emotional capacity. It is not uncommon, then, to use an IDOL (which is NOT the same as the goal itself) to represent the goal of absolute subjectivity which one is striving for and cannot be perceived, felt or conceived via the BMI and their PET.<p>This representation, symbol, takes the form of a goddess/god whose strange and crazy figures and ornamentation are intended to initially (1) evoke questions in the seeker as t to their presence and (2) inspire more devotion once their significance is intellectually understood.<p>Coming back to the genius mathematician. If one traces one's own moments of lucidity or inspiration, one would find that they come at times when the mind is relatively calm, composed and engaged in a subject. The extrapolation of this is the state of bhakti yoga (complete absorption in the ideas represented by the deity), and most adherents thereto ascribe the 'doing' of their thoughts, words and deeds to the deity Itself, to efface their egos and move closer to their ideal of transcending the world itself.<p>Now look at that simple statement: ""These ideas were revealed to me by my God"" [paraphrase]. The simplistic notion that an apparition appeared before him or in his mind to provide him with these incredible insights does not hold to a scientifically-inclined mind. But the notion that he had trained his mind so highly that he was able to become absorbed single-thoughtfully upon a subject to the extent that he was able to perceive subtle nuances therein, indeed subtle nuances that would seem 'magical' to a non-trained observer is not unthinkable. That he then ascribed his discoveries to a deity is something that happens daily in Indian life and as previously covered is intended as an effacement and ultimate transcendence of the ego and the world it projects.<p>I can highly recommend A Parthasarathy's Vedanta Treatise if you are interested further.",1355853848

A diabetic can eat as much protein, fat and fiber as they want, but have to match insulin levels to their carbohydrate consumption (except fiber).<p>I'm highly simplifying, but carbohydrates are converted to blood sugar which insulin converts to energy at a cellular level. Insulin is needed so your cells can feed off the blood sugar.  The blood sugar that isn't used is stored as fat.  Carbs are quickly and easily converted to fat.  Other forms of food can eventually get converted to blood sugar, but not as easily and quickly as carbs. You absorb protein, minerals, vitamins, fibers, etc. very differently than pure Carbs.  So a Carb rich diet will make you fat.  Diabetics are only concerned with Carbs because they have the highest impact on their blood sugar level.<p>Further, America has proved this. Few cultures consume as much carbohydrate rich food as America, and as a result, they have the biggest issue with diabetes, obesity, etc.  Carbohydrates are the cheapest food to buy (fast food and junk food are very heavy in carbohydrates), so a disproportionate number of low income people have obesity problems<p>Dude, its the carbs.",1355853623

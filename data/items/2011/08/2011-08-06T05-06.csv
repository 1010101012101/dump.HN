They won't happen because they are not in the best short term interest of the politicians making the decisions. Natural selection has weeded out the congressmen that make decisions contrary to their ability to raise campaign money.<p>That is the root cause of the problem. Until that is solved, there's no point in dreaming up efficient solutions, because they won't happen.",1312610313

At home they support the economy of the US by buying things whit their salaries here.  Soldiers at home are cheaper than soldiers on a battleground. Add to that lower amount of injured soldiers etc... That's also a cost when you factor in the medical costs on the battlefield with the need for quick transport to a hospital etc and future disabilities.",1312610283

Here's a link to the relevant article on groklaw:<p><a href=""http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110427052238659"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20110427052238659</a><p>Disregarding your comments on patriotism and the USPTO (which I don't fully disagree with), the disturbing part about Google being unable to buy these patents, is that they appear to have been actively collaborated against in the auctions. Not being able to build a substantial patent portfolio denies them the ability to countersue in response to frivolous patent threats against Android, which I assume is a large part of why Google was willing to bid so highly for them.<p>Personally the part of the recent auction I found most disturbing was that the patents weren't sold to the highest bidder, they were sold to a conglomeration of bidders, some of which had already tapped out. To make a parallel with an art auction, it would be like half of the bidding floor banding together simply to ensure that another promiment bidder <i>didn't</i> get the piece. Possibly a valid action, but possibly anticompetitive, depending on the situation.",1312610221

I'm starting to realize that as a company gets big, it takes more and more people just to keep things going, make sure their systems don't melt down, do support, analyze all the useage data they're generating, manage the other people, etc. They're only at like 60 employees, right? That's really not many for a site with 25M users, many of whom run an agent that constantly hits their servers asking if there are updates.<p>Twitter's done a lot of hiring (up to ~500 people) and not a lot of releasing (last real release was ... new twitter?). Are they working on something huge and secret? No, they're keeping the site from melting down, making things more efficient so that that they site won't melt down in a few months, and making incremental improvements to the growing number of pieces of their service.<p>I'm sure Dropbox is working on more, but I don't think that they've made significant progress on anything earth-shattering. I'd guess that they're showing investors some very solid revenue and usage trajectories and some plans on how they're going to extract more money out of more companies in fairly obvious ways. Maybe some early prototypes of something earth-shattering.<p>(Cue giant release proving me totally wrong within a month)",1312610182

Will you be able to use Android phones without Android? No. I don't think your example fits well here.<p>Android OS is the most essential part to make Android phones operate. It does cost Google a lot of money to make, yet it gives phone manufacturers licenses for cheap, just to make phones cheap enough so that users chose them over iPhones. Google wants it so bad they are willing to lose a lot of money now hoping it will pay off in future when everyone has Androids. Apple (and Microsoft) who cannot use this model (they don't dominate in ads or search markets) obviously don't like this. How would you feel if you were Apple? So they will try to use patents to make Android licenses more expensive. I hope I explained it well this time.<p>P.S. I don't know what is the right response to dumping.

It is entirely possible for more debt than currency to exist.  Suppose you deposit $100 at a bank, which lends $80 of it to Alice.  She deposits her $80 in another bank which lends $60 to Bob.  So that's a perfectly legit scenario where more debt ($140) exists than currency ($100).

If you grant that Google was trying to buy the patents defensively, then what is your problem with their ""PR as a tactic"", it fits perfectly in with their story. They wanted to buy the patents so that they would have leverage to protect themselves and HTC/Samsung/Moto who have been sued and are paying out to Apple and Microsoft. It didn't work so their only remaining stance is to argue that the system is wrong. The fact that they tried to excel or protect their interests, considering that their partners are <i>very currently and very really having to pay out to Microsoft</i>, doesn't seem to damage their stance in my opinion. The act of defensively buying patents and calling the system broken are not mutually exclusive.<p>>And yes, the existence of 50 arrows pointing at not Google compared to 3 at Google (from companies not shipping phones) does do something against the claim Google is being picked on.<p>I've not seen anyone claiming that ""everyone who's not Google"" is teaming up against Google.

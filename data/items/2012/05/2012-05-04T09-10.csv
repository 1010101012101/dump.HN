The idea is to xor all valid inputs together.<p>When there is only one input this results in output=input.
If all 3 are active then the output is A^B^C.
The trick is that the next cycle only the granted input (say A) is removed so the output is B^C<p>Receivers are required to XOR two sequential values to extract the actual data.  In this case (A^B^C)^(B^C)=A.<p>See the ""NoX Router"" for details and explanation of how this compares to alternative arbitration approaches:

Something that breaks with xor lists.<p>Secondly if you have so many nodes that the memory saving of  one pointer is significant. Its likely traversing that list will take forever and force you to use a different algo anyway.<p>... an improvement on basic linked lists would be 16B/32B/128B/512B etc alignment of the nodes memory address and bit packing the Left/Right offset in units of the alignment unit.

The iPads current keyboard is very forgiving when I mis-press a key initially and move my finger to the right key. This should not cause the cursor to move. An easy adaptation of this solution would be to just use the two finger gesture for moving the text (if you want to move it faster, just use the tap and refine strategy I mentioned earlier).<p>Additionally, I wonder how text selection would work when typing with one hand. I rarely use an iPad the way it is shown here, laying on a table in landscape mode. Perhaps in addition to using shift, holding the two finger gesture could also initiate select mode.

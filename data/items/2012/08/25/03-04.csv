It has more to do with blood pH and CO2 levels, as well as perceived work of breathing, and a whole lot of other factors we don't understand. Maintaining adequate blood oxygenation is unlikely to do much to fix the shortness of breath caused by IPF.<p>If this technology comes to fruition, it would increase the number of people able to survive until transplant.

And even if Samsung ultimately has to pay the $1bn judgement, the company can afford it.<p>But we're likely to see a ban on many mobile devices from Samsung and other manufacturers in the wake of this case, as an emboldened Apple tries to create an unprecedented monopoly. If so, the ultimate loser will be competition in the technology marketplace, with even more power accruing to a company that already has too much....<p>Crucially, the jury found none of Apple's patents invalid, despite substantial evidence that others anticipated many of the innovations that Apple put together when it released its first iPhone. This is a shame, because Apple's abuse of our out-of-control patent system has given Apple its chief ammunition in its global campaign to destroy Google's Android operating system, which Samsung (and many others) adopted for its smart phones.</i>",1345866917

Us moviemaking guys, the studios, have less courage to make a movie like that today with the kind of racial, sexual overtones."" It's sad. I would appreciate a big budget movie studio that did not consistently churn out the safest derivative crap they can.<p>I do appreciate that there's one consumer electronics company that attempts and succeeds at novel, high risk products. Of course, there's a good chance that risk taking spark died recently, but I have appreciated its presence until now.<p>Maybe patents are bad, but I don't think is a case where that stance holds much emotional appeal other than to those who like to see Apple lose. Most people think Samsung clearly did something shady here and deserves to be punished.",1345864071

4430921,comment,4429234,4429645,1,0,Variance,,,"Since math is just the formalization used to describe quantitative patterns observed, you're already seeing math as purely as it will ever get. Really, it's the other way around--since math is an abstraction of observation, what you observe with your senses day to day is a much more direct and fundamental reality. Math is a language, and reality is what it talks about. Similarly, people who speak English will find that the most effective visualization and perception of what they speak about is to just directly see and perceive the thing that they talk about.<p>That's why I've never thought that there's any ""Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in Describing the World"". Math is derived from reality and describes it insofar as it can be observed to be given a description, and so it's unsurprising that math is effective at describing what it's designed to effectively describe. It's like saying that English is unreasonably effective at talking about things.",1345863608

But everybody having the ability to communicate cheaply with everybody else is a new phenomenon. We got along for a good long time without it.<p>I would think that the government's ability to control  popular opinion was much stronger in the industrial age than in any time since. We got through that period okay.<p>I think the internet is awesome, and I hope people fight like hell to preserve it. But if some controls are placed on it, I doubt it presages a new Dark Age. Also, I think there will be some lasting benefit due to the reduced cost of global communications and coordination, even if blogs are outlawed.",1237363155

521350,comment,520642,520762,0,0,hardik,,,"IMHO, our understanding of ability to hedge risk is still in infancy. The idea of complete diversification of risk is only good on paper and a lot of mess is a result of companies naively (or greedily) thinking that they can achieve it.\nI recently attended a presentation by some very respected actuaries where they showed empirical evidence that while risk can be diversified in general (across assets as well as asset classes) in the tail end of economic scenarios all asset classes have strong positive correlation. In other words in general you can ensure consistent returns by diversification, when things go bad, you are screwed and nothing much you could have done would prevent that; writing derivative contracts which would save you from such scenario are contingent on counter-party not defaulting, which it did (until the US Gov. paid the counter party taxpayer money to prevent defaults).<p>At the end of the day, yes, it feels right to not only AIG but those counterparties should also feel the pain.. at least they should not be given 100 cents on a dollar!",1237362186

Early adopters in <i>our little echo chamber</i> are <i>perceived</i> as mostly using Macs.<p>Its funny how much we think we know about early adopters, or any other demographic, for that much.  Do we know whether the user is a man or a woman?  Do we know which way they voted in the last election?  What do they think about gay marriage?  What model phone do they own?  Have they ever played World of Warcraft?  Have they ever been to a NASCAR race?<p>Does the typical early adopter happen to share all the above with your answers?",1237361500

It's successful, at least in terms of traffic, so it's worth watching and perhaps learning from.<p>2. The web hasn't obliterated the old document formats (yet). Not everyone that has content in those formats has the time or inclination to replicate the layout in HTML, so Scribd is making distribution easier for them.

Finance is an essential part of an advanced economy, and advanced economies are much more fun to live in than the other kind.<p>Populism is driven by basic, tribal emotions and explanations that appeal to the lowest common denominator. Humans fear that which is complex and hard to understand. They are envious creatures with a poor natural grasp of economics. They reason that if the goldsmith is getting richer, why, then I must be getting poorer!<p>Populism hasn't really progressed since the days of goldsmith banking. That's not what it is built to do.<p>I don't think populism is the wisest way to modify the banking system, but sadly we have decided that voting is the best method to make such decisions. Since populism is simple and appeals to the gut instinct, it wins out in  votes. So populism is what we get.<p>> ""Because we failed to get it right once doesn't mean we should stop trying""<p>The first failure caused immense human suffering. What we have now needs some tinkering, but it is immensely better. It would be foolish to make large, rash actions to experiment recklessly when the costs are so high. Speaking of which:<p>>""or we nationalize the banking industry like others have done and admit that the only thing that's really to big to fail is the government.""<p>I can think of three nations off the top of my head that nationalized banks. One was temporary (Sweden). The other two had immense problems with bad debt in <i>good</i> times (Japan and China, if I recall correctly). It turns out that the profit motive does help banks make good loans.<p>> ""But our current system has clearly failed, something needs to be done, time for another experiment.""<p>Our system has produced the most prosperous society in the history of the world. It did a bad job reacting to a novel circumstance. It needs to be patched, not scrapped.<p>>""Talking about possible solutions on a website is pausing, it's not like we're implementing policy here or anything. It's just an interesting things to speculate about.""<p>There are a few places where temperate, informed discussion of these issues take place.

Hack:\nQuite often I want to refer back to a particular phrase or word in a book, and I have a devil of a time finding it. At times I've methodically re-read 10 or 20 pages in failing to find it. I've wished I could just google the damn book.<p>I can. By using Google Books or Amazon's search facility.

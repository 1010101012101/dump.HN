A cutaway lock is a normal lock with portions of the casing made out of transparent material or removed entirely.  Their specific function <i>is</i> to practice lock picking.  And blank keys aren't tools with a single usage scenario.  Good guys and criminals alike use them to copy or make keys.  The important thing here is not to judge by the equipment, but by the intent of the owner.  Most laws about owning lock picks reflect this pragmatic view.<p>Also, if you're attempting to criticize the activity of lock picking in general, realize that it is a long standing tradition in the hacker community.  Sergey Brin is a prominent example of a ""non-evil"" person who tinkered with it [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/technology/10google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/10/technology/10google.html</a>",1259560346

967398,comment,967277,967277,0,0,olefoo,,,"Open Source for businesses is a tactic, not a strategy. And open source projects are orthogonal to business products.<p>Most of us are working on startups where it makes sense to leverage available open-source toolkits to solve problems rather than buying prefab solutions. But for larger and more established companies it has always been the case that service and support costs are the primary driver of decisionmaking. Businesses don't buy a box of bits labeled Oracle, they buy into the support structure that trains Oracle consultants and DBAs, and that ensures that they will be able to solve their data management problems using Oracle tools. To some extent it doesn't matter whether the underlying software is or is not open source, it matters whether the toolkit and the techniques that that software represents can be used to solve problems effectively.<p>In situations where you need to be monkeying with the inner workings of your infrastructure; open source is a clear win, likewise when you are strapped for cash. But if you have cash on hand and a well supported solution that covers your use case; a packaged solution from a vendor may be a better value.",1259559243

It's hard to tell, but the orange-ish background highlights the cheaper price for a song or album if there's a price difference between the two stores.

My opinion is that if you want to have longevity in your career, you need to focus on the theory.  That doesn't mean that you don't learn the other stuff -- you just learn what's necessary, and move on.  More to the point:  when you're spending big bucks on college classes, you'd better be devoting your time to learning stuff that you can't learn from a few hours of quality time in a coffee shop with an O'Reilly book and a laptop.<p>For what it's worth, though, I've known many CS professors, and many industry programmers, and I wouldn't put the average of one group ahead of the other in terms of programming skill.  The myth that academics don't know ""industry"" is a myth (but there are plenty of coders who don't know anything about algorithms).<p>Also for the record: I like Perl.

Boston you can park for free overnight at a metered spot as long as you get in it after 6pm (8pm some spots). Some areas an unmarked spot is open for parking (as long as no sign speaks otherwise), other areas you'll likely get ticketed or towed. In Somerville you can park a motorcycle in any 'permit only' spot and its ok (I called 311 and asked), and Cambridge it will land you a $30 ticket to do the same- god knows about Boston.<p>Street cleaning is a joke and its really just a way to annoy people and raise revenue (which I understand the city needs, but if everyone uses the services- everyone should pay for them.

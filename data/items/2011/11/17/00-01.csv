For example, when the first examples of <i>Ajax</i> came out, it was really hacky and most programmers would have never believed what they'd see today.<p>So, I think that you are half right with the ""introducing complexity in an unstable, unaffordable and insecure client."" Maybe with the actual technology and framework, you are right. But I'm certain that in the following months/years, we'll go toward the road of a better UI.<p>And, I still believe that it's not as hard as people think to make UI update first and update later. 99.9% of the time, the server returns ""ok"" or something we already knew.

3245807,comment,3244754,3244754,7,0,einhverfr,,,"This distinction between license and ownership underscores the need both for open source software and also for expanding such models into other spheres.  Here I am defining ""ownership"" as ""economic ownership"" namely the right to utilize a good in any way one wishes to (following Hilaire Belloc's definition of ownership).  Here ownership of a copy is distinct from ownership of the ideas or expressions in the copy, and the question becomes what you own when you get a copy of a piece of software or a recording of music.<p>With a piece of software, what you own is typically restricted by a clickwrap agreement.  You agree not to exceed your client access license ownership with server software for example.  With music what you own is the right to listen to that music for your private enjoyment only.  With software you get some limited economic ownership, but with music you only get non-economic ownership.<p>With open source software you get (nearly with the GPL and complete with the BSD license) full economic ownership.  You can connect as many clients to the server software as you want.  You can deploy it for customers.  You can use the software in any way you wish to use it, and you can combine it with other goods to produce goods for resale.  Only in this last area are there any limits to what is owned with open source software, and then only sometimes.<p>I don't believe that musicians right now know how to benefit entirely from creating entirely open content, but musicians could compete at the moment in part by offering additional ownership of their music:  get my songs, play them in your store, display my videos publicly to an audience of 500 people or less per viewing, ensuring that people are buying not only entertainment but also that the music has value.  The fact that it has value means it will be played more.  The fact that it will be played more means it provides more advertising for live shows.",1321489015

3245784,comment,3243434,3244582,2,0,Kuiper,,,"To extend the video game analogy, one activity that some video gamers have made a sport of is ""speed running,"" or trying to completely a single-player game in as little time as possible.    Sites like <a href=""http://speeddemosarchive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speeddemosarchive.com/</a> host videos, and people compete to get the lowest time.<p>There are two ways that one typically goes about improving on the existing record.  The first is to look at the video posted by the current record holder, dissect the run, and find all of the small mistakes that the current record-holder made.  Shave off a few seconds here, a few seconds there, and by the end of your run you've beaten a game in 4 hours and 57 minutes instead of 5 hours.  That's playing harder.<p>The other way to break existing records is to start completely from scratch, map out the game and figure out if there's a different route to take that the previous runner didn't.  Maybe it's doing the levels in a different order so you spend less time walking across the world map.  Maybe you spend an extra 10 minutes picking up a stronger sword that allows you to save 20 minutes over the course of the game because you're killing enemies faster.  These are the kinds of improvements that lead to people turning a 5 hour game into a 4 hour game.  That's playing better, not harder.",1321488563

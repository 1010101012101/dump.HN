It buys the support of public teachers unions, which will support the reelection of politicians whose sole idea for  school reform is ""more money"".<p>Another factoid that Cato likes to throw out is that public education spending has doubled on an inflation adjusted basis since the early '80s, yet scores on certain standardized tests have stayed constant. Still, listen to any presidential debate. Every candidate calls for more money for schools, more teachers, more computers, etc. It doesn't occur to them that the system is broken when scaling up the input produces no additional output.<p><a href=""http://www.heritage.org/research/Education/images/b2179_chart4.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.heritage.org/research/Education/images/b2179_char...</a>",1238871506

546544,comment,546080,546348,0,0,prewett,,,"Multiple monitors is really handy for GUI development.  Particularly on Windows.  Visual Studio eats up tons of space, so your program overlaps the code you are stepping through, leading to a lot of repaint messages that can make tracing through code tedious.  Plus, windows can't be moved, resized, minimized, or otherwise interacted with until Windows can call their wndproc.  Debugging an always-on-top window (like a menu) is a pain.<p>Multiple monitors is less effective on Linux.  X can unmap, move, etc. windows without their permission, so virtual desktops still work when a program is being debugged (like when you need to look up documentation).  Plus, emacs is pretty slim, visually, so you can often fit your program right next to it.  'Course, if you use eclipse, it sucks up extra space like VS.<p>(Vista might be able to move windows without their permission, since the contents are redirected to a buffer.  I don't have vista to try.)",1238871087

The first ""hacking"" I ever did was in jr high when I finally got to mess with computers all day - which had been donated by wordperfect and thus permanently shined with the blue of wp5. At 16 I got my CNA and landed a job at novel, however after starting to sign papers they informed me you had to be 18. Great. Changed my mind, traveled the world, lived in england, fell in love with programming, ended up back in utah valley 6 years later. Actually worked as a developer for a company that was in the first novel building down by geneva steel and later with another company at what was the wordperfect complex.<p>Now I realize the future I always imagined working for one of these companies is only going to come from creating it myself.

It should be wrong to discriminate based on religion, so long as you don't reverse discriminate as well.

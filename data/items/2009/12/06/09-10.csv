979383,comment,978253,978607,0,0,Ras_,,,"Interesting. This ""almost total lack of rank"" is also present in Finland (mandatory conscription could be the reason why).<p>In Finnish the personal pronouns second-person singular (you) and plural (you) are not the same. Second-person singular is ""sinä"" and plural is ""te"". Latter can be used as a singular when talking with an older person, but most don't like to be addressed with it (equality - people don't want to stand out). For example if I were to meet the CEO of Nokia, I probably would use the singular ""sinä"". Even more so it is appropriate to address cabinet ministers with their first name.<p>Finnish women always use their first names when addressing each other, but men might not. We quite often use surnames (that practice certainly comes from the military) - could this be because we might have more unique surnames than first names?<p>We don't have that many start-ups. Instead we have 5th most patents per capita (Israel #16). <a href=""http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_pat_gra_percap-economy-patents-granted-per-capita"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/eco_pat_gra_percap-economy...</a><p>Our ""Chutzpah"" would be ""Sisu"". <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu</a><p>Does communication in Israel often include small talk? In Finland it certainly does not.",1260093237

979377,comment,978859,978859,0,0,spitfire,,,"Ada. It's what Java should have been to begin with.\nStrictly typed, safety minded OOP programming language with modern features like generics and tasking (in 1983 no less).\nIt's designed to handle large projects over a long lifespan - millions LOC over decades.<p>The F-16, F-15, F22, any boeing/airbus aircraft and most rail systems are developed in it. As are financial systems, medical equipment, etc. It's the strong silent type of programming language you don't hear about it much because it just works.<p>And there's a JVM target for it.<p>EDIT: You might wonder why I mentioned all the safety critical stuff - Because safety is synonymous with reliability and maintainability. With Ada I find things are at times quite boring - things just get done without problems. This sort of thing tends to appeal to more mature developers.",1260092754

After that, though, I read the blog, tried out the program, and now I'm not so sure. It seems like it might be something Ben Noland is ready to confidently pursue. Also, I would say that it usually doesn't work well, not that it never works well. I'm not big on absolutes when it comes to things like creativity, business, and motivation.<p>One thing that makes zipit not apply is that it's already partly a reality in two different ways. First, he has a pretty good prototype, with good branding already. Second, his call to action has actually started some serious interest, from what I can tell. There are quite a few encouraging comments and suggestions here and on his blog, for something that was just announced half a day ago.<p>Ben, I hope you can bring collabedit to fruition!",1260092270

For example, the ""unless"" operator strikes me as very useless. It certainly doesn't save any typing and  it seems that the existence of many ways of doing the same thing makes it <i>more</i> confusing, not <i>less</i>.<p>That said, I'm definitely in the ""Perl has serious readability and maintenance problems and Python makes me weak in the knees"" camp.",1260091355

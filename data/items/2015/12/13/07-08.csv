My addiction is the high obtained from starting up and the opportunities that always seem to knock and i pursue, yet never work out.<p>I recently had an awesome remote front end gig, yet this crazy outlandish opportunity knocked and I tried to ignore it, but they kept knocking (reality TV show for startups), so I gave up my job for it.  I didnt make it that far in the competition, so now I am jobless .. late 30s .. similar debt .. dont own my own home .... no family  and g/f is tired of my lifestyle/gave up on me.<p>Overall you are not alone .. this stuff for those who struggle with business guys/girls (im an inventor), don&#x27;t have rich relatives or friends (investors to help you have a long runway to figure your road to success) isn&#x27;t easy.  Yet, we continue to do it ... it is an addiction, yet again Im too old now to drop everything(as I just did).<p>Also, there are so many of us in the industry who jump from one dev job to another for various reasons.  Again, you are not alone ... we all have the desire to leave our mark on this earth and or just do what we love to do.. create awesome stuff on the web!  Ironically my stuff helps me get jobs and then as you can see above distracts me from keeping many great steady jobs(but I AM DONE unless those who knock offer me loads of money & or a solid job doing what I love to do; invent).",1449993583

As an example, if someone in India gets stuck doing something they are unlikely to speak up about it until you ask then about it, this isn&#x27;t because they are lazy or whatever but just because their culture is a lot different to the West. The way you need to work with a team here is a lot different to how you would work with a team in the West - this alone can be the cause of a good chunk of problems that occur when outsourcing.<p>As your team is remote you can&#x27;t ask them a question and expect an answer in 10 minutes, but you shouldn&#x27;t expect this of a onsite engineer either as you&#x27;ll just ruin their flow.

For example, if you create Cheetos out of corn, you grind corn into meal, then bake it or whatever. When it goes into your stomach, it readily dissolves into an easily-digestible soup of corn specks and oil. If you just eat corn, the kernels have much less surface area available for the digestion process and some parts remain (notoriously) undigested.<p>That means it&#x27;s pretty easy to calculate the number of calories that highly processed foods contribute, since it&#x27;s near the theoretical max.",1449990649

It&#x27;s a situation they created for themselves and they can fix themselves.<p>I also can&#x27;t share her concern about &#x27;contributing to unlawful activities&#x27;.

While I have not completely figured it out, one thing I realized is that, even though I shelve many of my side projects, occasionally I come back to some of them, with fresh enthusiasm and move it forward another step or two (before loosing enthusiasm again). I realized that given enough &quot;cycles&quot; at least some of them are bound to be completed.<p>So a new approach I am trying is the &quot;GPU Pipeline of side projects&quot;. First, I choose to trim my list of side projects to a few important ones (4 is a number I like, so four). I work on them in a parallel pipelined fashion. So I have one that&#x27;s more advanced, one that is being setup, one that is being fleshed out, one still in ideation phase (you get the idea).<p>Secondly, I realize that when building things, the novelty can come from &quot;recursing down to the details&quot;. For example, setup a AWS pipeline for code deployment would mean, learning how to setup an Ec2 deployment, then a Chef or Puppet instance, then easy config management of them, best way to document our setup (gitbook etc) and so on.... So if we use our boundless curiosity, which is both a strength and a weakness, to look a little deeper, we will find enough novelty to keep going even in a &quot;single&quot; project.<p>What I realized is that one single project is like a LISP S-Expression. (project). You (eval project), and it returns (list sub-project1 sub-project2 interesting-research3 wonderful-idea4)\nAll you have to do is keep eval&#x27;uating the sub-expressions till you hit an &quot;atom&quot; of truth to share with the world.",1449990568

The AI could evolve into a super intelligence before dinner time.<p>We don&#x27;t need to rely only on humans to design every aspect of neural networks. We are already computationally searching for AI designs that work better. In a recent paper, hundreds of variations of design for the neuron of the LSTM network have been tried to see which one is the best and which of its components are important.<p>Also, we can play with networks like clay - starting from already trained networks, we can add new layers, make layers wider, transfer knowledge from one complex network into a simpler one and initialize new networks from old networks so as they don&#x27;t start from scratch every time. We can download models trained by other groups and just plug them in (see word2vec for example). This makes iterative experimenting and building on previous success much faster.<p>I don&#x27;t think evolving a super intelligence will happen by simple accident, it will be an incremental process of search. The next big things I predict will be capable robots and decent dialogue agents.",1449990225

Last I checked, this isn't something they teach in school. MIT and Stanford should have (undergrad) courses on founding startups that covers all the major steps. Students can make rational choices once they have the facts.",1248778789

This interface breaks that expectation by following links as soon as you mouse over them.  That is a terrible UI decision.<p>If I want to open one of those panels, I'll click on it.  That's what I've been taught to do by every website I've ever visited.  There is absolutely no reason to change such a valuable affordance.  So don't.",1248778694

So that ""beautiful daughters"" guy has found a gold mine. Who cares about science - tell people what they want to hear, and what they can use to chat on parties, and you can make lots of money. (Not only selling books, but also getting grants and invitations to universities, no doubt).<p>With that thesis the author can get famous, where is his incentive to be honest about it?<p>I am waiting for the corresponding articles to appear in all major magazines in my country (presented as established fact, of course).

A 5-inch e-ink touch screen is a novelty - I believe only larger Sony and iRex models have it.<p>A search on ""Samsung reader SNE-50K"" yielded a few good short notices - seems it's only S.Korea for now, priced at USD 274, in line with other 5 or 6 inch e-ink readers.<p>P.S.

For the former, you're right: the framework is less relevant, since the system is just basically responding to page requests. However, for a no-refresh app, the opposite is true, especially if the app is highly complex. The framework must manage the transfer of all code and content, which is where pre-fetching and factoring become particularly important.",1248775320

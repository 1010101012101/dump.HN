Business interests in the EU and don&#x27;t like to put in the extra effort? Or do you just enjoy that mode of righteous indignation?<p>I find it amusing that – even taking the Google shills out of the picture –, most of the &#x27;debate&#x27; around this topic is along the lines of Americans preaching to Europeans about how they&#x27;re &#x27;doing it wrong&#x27;, often with emotionally charged language, just like your comment here.

7821261,comment,7820996,7820996,2,0,thegeomaster,,,"Maybe it&#x27;s worth emphasizing that writing kernel code is a very responsible task, not to be taken lightly. Hackers coming from a userspace background tend to think it&#x27;s just &quot;userspace with a few quirks&quot; which is grossly wrong: your code has to be <i>completely free of bugs</i>, as a dangling pointer, for instance, won&#x27;t just send you a friendly SIGSEGV and terminate your ass, it will crash the whole system, leading to consequences for everyone who relies on its stability. Just imagine introducing a bug which crashes a Linux-based life support system. You could be responsible for endangering human lives. (I ageee that Linux isn&#x27;t a sane choice here, but just for the sake of the argument.)<p>Also, standards to get your pull requests merged into mainline Linux are insanely high, but even given that, you can never rely solely on maintainers&#x27; code review to catch your mistakes.

Someone in the US could say &quot;I&#x27;ll fight all the way to the Supreme Court!!!&quot; but you would be a fool to trust your business to their determination.  Especially if they say it about a subpoena, which means they haven&#x27;t even retained a lawyer to ask about this.  (If your business plan depends on being able to wage a legal battle, you really shouldn&#x27;t be scrambling through the yellow pages for a lawyer when you get your first subpoena.)<p>Back to the topic, I&#x27;ll have to point out that this <i>still</i> isn&#x27;t evidence of a company being required to backdoor a product.  Hushmail, the same company that thinks it can fight a subpoena for third-party data all the way to the Supreme Court, said &quot;well, we might be compelled to backdoor our product.&quot;  This is just more repeating of the meme without evidence.  It&#x27;s unfortunate because some developer who remembers Hushmail might take their ill-informed legal opinion as reality.<p>Of course, Hushmail <i>had access to cleartext copies of the messages</i>.  That&#x27;s the killer.  The government has the right to evidence about third parties in your possession.  (Canada derives from British law tradition like the US.  The government&#x27;s right to all evidence is a concept that goes back centuries.  If you can show that Canada broke from this tradition I would be most interested.)",1401450918

Given what we know, the most reasonable assumption is that the developers did not want to abandon the project to the wind and the future without leaving a proper landing page indicating that the project is unmaintained.  Vulnerabilities could be discovered in the future.<p>This is true of every piece of software, always.  No specific flaws have been mentioned by anyone.  Here, the (supposed) developers flat-out told us they just lost interest.  There hasn&#x27;t been a release in years, and now -- if his identity were to become known -- a negative result on the audit (no vulnerabilities found) would not be interpreted as an endorsement from him that the software is secure.<p>When/if the vulnerability is found, he will not be required to say &quot;I told you so&quot; or &quot;I&#x27;m sorry.&quot;  The last ten years absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, that&#x27;s just common sense.<p>And there is one vulnerability I think I&#x27;ve heard that&#x27;s not surprising anyone -- TC keeps the keys in memory while the partition is mounted.  Anyone with enough practice can supposedly freeze the chips, unplug them, put them into another machine, and boom grab your keys without disturbing the frozen bits.  Presumably law enforcement and other APT entities will be getting better at this technique over time.<p>If you&#x27;re worried about this and other threats, best to keep your partitions unmounted.",1401450457

Your post is bullying and stupid. Let&#x27;s start with your &quot;misogyny&quot;, which actually just means &quot;prejudice against women&quot;.<p>If you say <i>there cannot be such a thing</i> as a woman who is into tech, that is prejudice. If you say that (generally) women aren&#x27;t into tech, that IS NOT prejudice <i>because you are NOT pre-judging</i>.<p>So marincounty says he (I assume) has never seen\nwomen having monomaniacal focus on tech. He has seen men having that focus. He has seen such focus helping men careerwise in tech. And he has seen women more interested in marrying up than in careers. Stereotype yes, generalization yes, prejudice no. This is simply describing his observations. Just because someone says something that doesn&#x27;t go along with &quot;Grrl Power!&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it misogyny.<p>By the way, you can read up on the research by Professor Catherine Hakim at the London School of Economics showing how women are not so interested in careers, just as marincounty observed.<p>Secondly, when marincounty is describing that women should be not into tech and helpful for some aspects of his life, he&#x27;s <i>describing his own dating preferences!</i> How the hell is that misogynist? What right do you have to tell him who he should like? And who on earth prefers <i>hurtful</i> women instead of helpful ones?<p>Finally, when marincounty describes successful women as scary, he is describing <i>other</i> men&#x27;s opinions! He is NOT advocating for that position, in fact he worries that he might suffer from the same <i>defect.</i> If he thought this way of thinking were OK, he wouldn&#x27;t have ended with &quot;I hope this changes in the future&quot;.<p>Do you really think it&#x27;s a good idea to down vote people for thought crimes when they deviate from orthodoxy?

When society becomes so advanced that it produces more than enough for everybody – but also so advanced that most individuals below genius level have little to contribute and no way of earning money – everyone should get a yearly salary just for existing. Think welfare, except that it goes to everybody, there’s no stigma, and it’s more than enough to live on. This titanic promise has run up against a giant iceberg with BUT HOW WOULD WE PAY FOR IT written in big red letters on the front. If we cancelled all existing welfare and entitlement programs – which makes sense if we’re giving everyone enough money to live comfortably on, we would only free up enough money together for a universal income of $5,800. I don’t know if you can live on that, but I’d hate to have to try.<p>But we’ve gotten off track. We were counting the benefits of formal education. We did not do so well in trying to prove that it left you more knowledgeable, but it did seem like it had some practical value in getting you a little bit more money. With your shiny college degree, you can confidently assert “I’ve got mine”, just as long as you take care not to notice the increasingly distant hordes of manual laborers or the statistics showing that the yours you’ve got is less and less every year.<p>What of the costs of education? What have you lost out on?<p>Well, first about twenty thousand hours of your youth. That’s okay. You weren’t using that golden time of perfect health and halcyon memories when you had more true capacity for creativity and imagination and happiness than you ever will again anyway. If you hadn’t had your teachers to tell you that you needed to be making a collage showing your feelings about The Scarlet Letter, you probably would have wasted your childhood seeing a world in a grain of sand or Heaven in a wild flower or something dumb like that.<p>I’m more interested in the financial side of it. At $11,000 average per pupil spending per year times thirteen years plus various preschool and college subsidies, the government spends $155,000 on the kindergarten-through-college education of the average American.<p>Inspired by a tweet: what if the government had taken this figure (adjusted for inflation) and invested it in the stock market at the moment of your birth? Today when you graduate college, they remove it from the stock market, put it in a low-risk bond, put a certain percent of the interest from that bond into keeping up with inflation, and hand you the rest each year as a basic income guarantee. How much would you have?<p>And I calculate that the answer would be $15,000 a year, adjusted for interest. We can add the $5,800 basic income guarantee we could already afford onto that for about $20,000 a year, for everyone. Black, white, man, woman, employed, unemployed, abled, disabled, rich, poor. Welcome to the real world, it’s dangerous to go alone, take this. What, you thought we were going to throw you out to sink or swim in a world where if you die you die in real life? Come on, we’re not that cruel.<p>So when we ask whether your education is worth it, we have to compare what you got – an education that puts you one grade level above the uneducated and which has informed 3.3% of you who Euclid is – to what you could have gotten. 20,000 hours of your youth to play, study, learn to play the violin, whatever. And $20,000 a year, sweat-free.",1401449798

It may be true of public and influential personalities, but who cares your choice of words as long as you convey the message? I believe that everything and everyone can be laughed at.<p>Sure, you may feel offended inside. But you should at least understand that it makes no sense and refrain from sharing your &quot;I&#x27;m offended&quot; feelings.

The real problem is demanding <i>Google</i> or other services like theirs to delete data that appears from <i>other</i> services, that Google has nothing to do with, other than indexing them. Of course you&#x27;d have to believe that once the data is gone from the parent host, it disappears from Google&#x27;s cache, too, automatically.<p>But just asking Google to get rid of it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to me, and I think it unnecessarily punishes them, too.

Disabling DPI scaling for the application and then scaling to 150% inside Chrome produces crisp, clear text. Firefox also didn’t scale automatically, but it has a setting to adjust to make it follow the Windows DPI scaling rules. Once set, Firefox looks very nice and crisp. For most people, that setting should already be set to follow DPI scaling.<p><a href=""http://www.anandtech.com/show/7157/asus-pq321q-ultrahd-4k-monitor-review/2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.anandtech.com/show/7157/asus-pq321q-ultrahd-4k-mo...</a><p>Note that the review predates the release of Firefox 22.<p>edit: This is the tracking bug for Firefox HiDPI support on Windows: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=820679&hide_resolved=0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=82067...</a> .

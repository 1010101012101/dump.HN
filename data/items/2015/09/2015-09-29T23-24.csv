Simply put, first worlder&#x27;s are not providing the value that their salaries demand.  And if we actually are, then the companies we work for will have an advantage and will eventually beat the competitors using cheap labor.<p>As well local inflation + foreign deflation will change this, it will probably fix itself due to the crazy printing of money in the US.

You can do all the normal stuff like check balances and deposit checks, but you can also open new accounts (including credit cards) and transfer money (between other accounts you own or to other people outside the bank). And yes, the app has the ability to add new transfer recipients, which only needs their email address or phone number. There is a protection to guard against unauthorized adding of new recipients, but you guessed it, the protection is in the form of a 2FA code sent via SMS. So if you&#x27;re already in the phone and in the banking app you can add yourself as a transfer recipient with your email address and verify the recipient addition because you can read the incoming text messages too. And the warning email that comes when you add a new recipient and initiate a new transfer is likely going to come to the same phone you&#x27;re currently holding. If you get into my banking app through my phone you can send yourself as much of my money as you want and cover your tracks so I wouldn&#x27;t know until my next statement comes, and to top it all off, it looks like I was the one who sent the money to you, so how am I going to argue that I didn&#x27;t?",1443570760

Let&#x27;s compare two groups of employees, a full-time group and a part-time group.<p>The first thing that might surface in this model is that the part-time group requires more people to fill the same number of deliveries that the full time group can fulfill.  So, in terms of numbers of bad deliveries, you&#x27;ll have more failures just because you had to draw a larger number of individuals for the part-time pool vs the full time - even if quality of individuals for the full time vs part-time are exactly the same.<p>Adding further assumptions doesn&#x27;t improve things. Maybe one might assume that part-time employees are more likely to move on to other jobs and leave the Flex workforce - well that&#x27;s more churn and you get more people in category b, and more people temporarily needing training/experience. Maybe the distributions aren&#x27;t exactly the same between full time and part time - one might theorize that scammers are more likely to take jobs under flex (maybe even under multiple aliases to keep from getting caught)... again this makes the performance under Flex worse...<p>Maybe even given the quality differences, it only ends up making sense to offer Flex delivery on the periphery of where it doesn&#x27;t make cost sense to install or expand full-time infrastructure.",1443569676

And there&#x27;s also all the negative, misery inducing, pressure when you realise, even if you sold the house and spent it all on plastic surgery you wouldn&#x27;t be anywhere near as attractive or thin as the size zero model they&#x27;ve just tried to use to sell you the gadget you probably don&#x27;t need, that you probably can&#x27;t afford that was likely made by some &quot;exploited&quot; person from resources that probably aren&#x27;t sustainable and then shipped halfway round the world. And then you go and buy it anyway and hate yourself for being gullible and buying something you probably can&#x27;t afford... just so you can support some guy who&#x27;s just doing his job but secretly hates himself for engaging in a zero-sum game with the rest of mankind and persuading you to buy something you... every time he sits down at his desk so he can buy his kids new ipads for christmas when they&#x27;d arguably be better off without anyway [3].<p>Another nash equilibrium in a world crying out for socially optimal solutions [4] or just an another inevitable inefficiency of capitalism [5].<p>I mean what ever happened to the Just In Time philosophy. We&#x27;ve ran with it on the supply side so stuff is cheaper than it should be, but every day i get bombarded by tens of emails from companies investing a lot of effort in trying to kiddology me into buying stuff which i thankfully just filter away (as i do with the rest of it - ad-blockers, don&#x27;t watch live tv or listen to radio stations with ads, don&#x27;t buy into the whole sky pay for stuff and then also have to watch ads). It&#x27;s almost like a stupid tax.<p>At the end of the day I&#x27;m just not going to buy your <unnecessary> thing so stop wasting my time/sanity/electricity/bandwidth and yours. It&#x27;s not as though, for example, if i want to buy a new tent (which so far i&#x27;ve done about every 5 years) or do a canvas (probably twice a year) i can&#x27;t just wait ten minutes for the next millets sale or photobox offer (i mean when does photobox not have a sale on for something they just keep increasing the base price of anyway). And anyway i&#x27;d probably be better going somewhere that had spent slightly less on their kiddology so their quality sucked less.<p>I entirely get why people do it, the &quot;good&quot; of the website/service/... i provide hopefully outweighs the &quot;evil&quot; of the mechanisms i go to try and support it, but if you didn&#x27;t &quot;need&quot; the money, would anyone go anywhere near an ad-broker?<p>I can&#x27;t help but think if we factored money out of this whole equation, this whole pyramid of snafu would collapse and we can move onto a slightly more healthy, enlightened society? Is this the best we can do? Would basic income help [6]? Or do i have to wait for likely societal collapse to a lower energy level to render this whole thing moot (see Tainter)?<p></more ranty than i intended><p>[1] <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/litost/15113770968/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/litost/15113770968/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhjCrL40JIM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhjCrL40JIM</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGab38pKscw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGab38pKscw</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jILgxeNBK_8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jILgxeNBK_8</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://libcom.org/library/inefficiency-capitalism-brian-oliver-sheppard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://libcom.org/library/inefficiency-capitalism-brian-oli...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income</a>",1443569607

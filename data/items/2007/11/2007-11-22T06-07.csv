I'd like to see more sane comparisons, like: making a TCP connection, making a web request, encrypting and decrypting a string, computing base64, md5, etc.<p>And in Python, print ""hello, world"" is bad form. It would be proper to write (news.YC is omitting some newlines below)<p>def main():
  print ""hello, world""<p>if __name__ == ""__main__"":
  main()",1195714676
82685,comment,82534,82674,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Okay, you might want to actually look at some of those links. Just in case anybody else doesn't know what conversion tracking is, basically:<p>1. User clicks on ad.<p>2. User does something advertiser considers significant, aka a ""conversion"", like going to a download site or a credit card entry page.<p>3. Google tracks that occurence and crunches the numbers.<p>4. Advertiser can make decisions about what ads to run based upon how many conversions they get. Thus, if political ads never ""convert"" to donations, it's obvious they should be removed.",1195714606

This is not for non lisp users, it's a way to make javascript and client side development more bearable for lisp users. <p>As far as the abstractions, you will need to write some ugly DOM code at first, but then you hide away the ugly low level stuff inside of a package, write a couple of macros and you move on to writing the meat of the application at a higher level of abstraction.<p>To make an analogy, think of starting with C, implementing Python in it and then writing your application in it.",1195714204

82680,comment,81594,82382,0,0,Zak,,,"So ""robust"" = ""rigid""?<p>I asked you to explain yourself because you were expressing a belief - that a statically typed language that uses a lot of boilerplate and doesn't have first class functions is preferable to a dynamically typed language that doesn't require a lot of boilerplate and does have first class language - that is believed to be false by most members of this community. You are, of course free to get excited over anything you want, but expect to be challenged if you make meaningless claims about your favorite technologies.",1195713466

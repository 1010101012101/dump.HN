However, you've no idea how how much I want to go back to school but irony is that it's no more an easy choice. It's really hard to go back to school later in your life. I dropped out of school because I was kind of bored too. I will reckon that you should stay at school. Attend as many math classes you can. Also, take the hardest courses you can find in your school. Remember, these four years is the most important time in your life and this is when you can really enjoy life. TRUST me. Keep attending the school. In the interim try different things. IF something takes off and has a potential to grow only then consider this choice. Now that I'm married and badly want to go to school but you've no idea how hard it is. I know eventually I will.",1227970576

But I couldn't.<p>Then I went to the article and was skimming through it. Just gave up when I hit this imagine ""race track"" thing. Was too lazy at that point in time.<p>However the wikipedia picture did it in seconds. I didn't even have to read the above quote :)
Just proves that ""a picture is worth a thousand words""",1227969865

After that it can be deployed instantly...<p>I guess it would be possible to note in a bug tracking app ""we would have deployed here"" and then see how many, and what kind of bugs were found between then and actual deployment, which checks found them, and whether any of those were rollback-causers.<p>That would give an estimate of how much good the checks did in each case, and a way to choose which checks are ineffective for their cost. (Ish - some checks may only trigger once, ever, to be priceless).",1227969198

cappuccino looks interesting - except that it also looks _way_ out of most people's league.  by that, i mean that you appear to have to abandon everything you've learned - the server-side languages you're used to - and go the whole hog into both a new language _and_ a new framework.
i've included it for reference, on the original article at advogato.",1227969096

I consider programming to be a process of building abstractions, and I think the best high-level abstractions are concise.<p>I like to quote Peter Norvig on the subject of interpreted languages. But in his quote, he uses ""interactive."" Maybe that's a better word:<p>""Which way would you rather learn to play the piano: the normal, interactive way, in which you hear each note as soon as you hit a key, or ""batch"" mode, in which you only hear the notes after you finish a whole song? Clearly, interactive mode makes learning easier for the piano, and also for programming. Insist on a language with an interactive mode and use it."" - Peter Norvig, Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years.<p>I've seen Objective-J and generally have good feelings about Javascript. But it's not particularly strong on one other criteria that I like to apply, which is that it should be easy to mix code written at different language levels.",1231734963

Sure, maybe one day our economic policies will shift away from capitalism, but we are a capitalistic nation (though with some unfortunate socialistic leanings IMHO). The reason why economists can apply practically the same methods to the 21st century as they did the 20th is that there is no real difference in the fundamentals of the economy have not changed. We still operate in a capitalistic society where supply and demand create (relatively) efficient generation of wealth. Sure, you can buy things on eBay and the like, and transactions on the stock market are now digital, but the market still fundamentally behaves in the same way.",1231734899

430070,comment,429477,429585,0,0,gruseom,,,"CatDancer, the problem is that the system can't always know what you intended: should the range be ""greedy"" and jump to incorporate the new numbers as you append them, or should it be ""strict"" and keep to the boundaries you originally gave it? Sometimes the latter behavior is what is desired, and expanding to C2:C11 would be wrong in that case. So what's really needed here is a lightweight way to communicate your intention to the system. (Actually, you <i>can</i> do this in Excel - <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/26b78"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/26b78</a> - but it's far from lightweight.)<p>I'm assuming that (in terms of your example) the invoice amounts that you're adding up would form a contiguous range of numbers, and that this range would be bounded by whitespace. That is, you might have some other range that used column C -- say ""expenses"" -- but it would be lower down, say starting at C15, and there would be at least one blank cell between the two. Is that correct? If it weren't for that lower range, you could just take the sum of the whole column and you'd be good. But it's too inconvenient (and not the ""spreadsheet way"") to force everything into separate columns.<p>If the above is correct, how would you feel about being able to define a range with a notation like this: ""C2:C✱"", meaning ""the range of cells that starts at C2 and goes down until it hits whitespace""? Then as you add numbers to C11, C12, etc., the range would automatically expand to include them. But you'd still have to be careful to ensure there was a ""moat"" of whitespace around your invoice range. If you filled in the last non-whitespace cell before your other table, you'd now have connected the two tables in such a way that ""C2:C✱"" would leap down to the end of the <i>second</i> table. In other words you'd be lumping ""invoices"" together with ""expenses"" which is probably incorrect.",1231733285

7827873,comment,7827552,7827552,11,0,fozzieBoston,,,"Harvard Business School student here. I find this article fascinating, specifically because it highlights the challenge of transferring the case based method to the virtual world. Unlike regular lectures where you can sit and absorb, the case based method requires you to actively participate and defend your argument in front of 90 peers. You have to prepare, think on your feet and be ready to challenge and build upon what others have said. Each one brings his own experience to the table, and you find yourself learning a lot more than in regular lectures.<p>For example, in an average HBS finance class you will get input from former PE guys on how to actually valuate a company, the potential pitfalls and what is important to remember. In a global economy class (BGIE) you can hear from  bankers who worked in Europe on how they faced the global economic crisis.<p>This creates high barriers to replicate the HBS model online. I&#x27;m not sure what the UX will be for replicating this discussion setting, and invoking individuals to share from their experience. How do you validate the quality of the comments? how do you highlight the takeaways in a situation where there is no one right answer? These are all though issues to solve, and I&#x27;m glad HBS is actively tackling it. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if they succeed.",1401587741

7827869,comment,7826768,7827190,1,0,zackmorris,,,"One more way to think about it is the propagation delay of a transmission line, or actually the opposite of that, which is the velocity factor, proportional to 1/sqrt(LC):<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_propagation_speed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_propagation_speed</a><p>Coaxial cables are great for blocking interference because one conductor is inside the other, so external electric fields can&#x27;t penetrate.  But they have a high parasitic capacitance because the outside conductor has a large surface area.<p>So if capacitance is causing too much propagation delay, you can use twisted pair.  It also works to avoid interference, but because the wires constantly change position in relation to electric fields:<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_pair</a><p>The problem with coax for cable TV though is that for high frequencies, losses can be high because the capacitor begins to approximate a conductor (and TV uses really high frequencies!).  So cable length becomes a limitation.  Then you use fiber optic cables (I find total internal reflection somewhat miraculous, like an optical analog to superconductors).<p>Also in computer chips, parasitic capacitance is a problem because capacitance grows with area and shrinks with distance.  But the conductors are so close to one another that even a small area results in a large capacitance.  That&#x27;s why the latency to memory can be orders of magnitude higher than say, cache.  Optical interconnects would help here as well.<p>It&#x27;s been 15 years since I studied this stuff though, so if I misremembered, somebody please correct me!",1401587692

Some of the employers want you to apply on their site, we understand that but we do encourage them to accept applications through Jr.DevJobs.<p>Also, we&#x27;re getting ready to roll out JobMatcher which takes your profile and matches it to jobs we think you&#x27;d be a great fit for. Basically, we&#x27;ll find jobs for you. So your profile is used for more than just sending along with applications :)<p>Thanks for the feedback and again, I know how frustrating it can be to fill out a bunch of info only to lose it. My sincerest apologies, hope to hear from you again.",1401584469

Notwithstanding that this was a professional environment, where alcohol during work hours is illegal in some places - why pressure someone who isn&#x27;t into those things to do them? Many Americans are vegans. Will you force them to eat Turkey during Thanksgiving, or else get the fuck out of America?",1401584438

That&#x27;s like saying a PowerPC Mac and a first-gen Intel Mac are &quot;not the same thing&quot;. That&#x27;s ridiculous. That they placed artificial limitations on the ARM version definitely is a black mark on the Surface.<p>I really don&#x27;t get the love of the Pro though. They are heavy and don&#x27;t get good battery life. That&#x27;s fine for a laptop thing, but not for a tablet.

They would read books to me, I would read books to them. It is the very reason I am so well spoken and intelligent to this very day. Books were awesome. I loved books.<p>Note the past tense. Loved. I have not been able to will myself to read a book on my own since the third grade. It was Lois Lowry&#x27;s The Giver, that is the last book I can confirm to you that I read, in whole, because I wanted to.<p>It was in the second grade that I had to do my first book report, and the entire concept of reading a book not for joy, but for work&#x27;s sake, was a concept I could never rationalize. Even while I was reading The Giver, a book I had selected out of the elementary school&#x27;s own library through my own volition, I received snide and discouraging comments from the library staff and teachers. &quot;He shouldn&#x27;t be reading that book.&quot; &quot;That book is too advanced for his age.&quot; And on, and on.<p>Something changed. I lost my will and my zest for books. Even books I would&#x27;ve very much liked to have finished and I found interesting, such as Mick Foley&#x27;s Have a Nice Day!, his autobiography about breaking in to the wrestling business, I have not been able to finish. I have no will left inside of me to crack open a book, to even lift one off of the shelf. I feel like my love for books was steadily beaten out of me at a young age by the very institution whose job it was to educate me with them.<p>At least this author seems to be on the right track. In all of my years of watching society ask &quot;What is wrong with the kids today?&quot; so few have bothered actually trying to ask the kids themselves.",1401584426

A rough transliteration of `huntMen` for example into CoffeeScript using normal node callback syntax is under 20 lines and relatively easy to understand:<p><pre><code>  huntMen =(buffy)->\n    soulmates =(buffy, cb, mates=[])->\n      getMatches buffy, 10, (userids)->\n        for u in userids\n         do (u)->\n          getThumbnail u, (thumb)->\n            isPicAVampire thumb, (is_vamp)->\n              unless is_vamp\n                getPersonality u, (personality)->\n                  getLastTalked u, match, (last_talked)->\n                    soulmates.push userid: u, thumb, personality, last_talked\n                    if soulmates.length >= 10\n                      cb(mates)\n                    else soulmates(buffy, cb, mates)\n              else soulmates(buffy, cb, mates)\n                      \n    soulmates buffy, (soulmates)->\n      #Do whatever you need to with soulmates\n</code></pre>\nObviously it's still more of a hassle to deal with than a more featurey async library, but there isn't quite the panic of trying to do the same thing in JS.<p>Edit: For comparison, the Tame.JS style transliterates to ~15 lines of CS— but presumably that would compile to dozens more lines of JavaScript.<p>In exchange, it is lying to you about what the program is actually doing, as opposed to the callback syntax which obscures nothing.

2777608,comment,2776122,2777105,9,0,wes-exp,,,"As a former C# developer who did try to run some stuff on Mono, I don't think it's an unfair description at all. First, some personal anecdotes:<p>- Wrote a brief (4 hours perhaps) Windows Forms app that did some math. Ran it on Mono. To Mono's credit, it did run. But to my horror, it actually computed incorrect results.<p>- I used a popular UI widget library for .Net. Turns out though most of it was written in C#, it had a number of Windows-only DLL imports, and could not run on Mono.<p>- At the time, ASP.net support was barely functional, if it existed <i>at all</i>. To be fair, I'm not sure if this is still the case or not.<p>Further, I will offer this additional argument. It is widely known that Java's promise of ""write once, run anywhere"" is a joke. Not that cross-platform Java can't be done (in fact it can), but it does take deliberate effort to ensure cross-platform support. And this is Java, which has official support for Linux (i.e., the JVM code on Linux is basically the same JVM code on Windows).<p>Contrast the Java situation with MS .Net, which does not have official support for Linux, but does have the option of Mono on Linux. MS .Net and Mono are two totally separate environments built out of separate code-bases. In this situation you are almost guaranteed to run into major migration headaches, if not outright barriers.<p>Now perhaps you are running from Mono from the start; well of course that is going to work. My original point isn't that Mono doesn't work when running code actually targeted to it; that may well be the case. My point is that Mono gives traditional .Net developers the false belief that they can run their Windows-targeted .Net code on Linux easily. For most, or at least many, that is simply not the case.",1311015355

Can the OP really be this naive about modern construction materials and practices?<p>150 years ago it wasn't uncommon to build a house out of hardwood planking, with a stone foundation. Post in beam construction using 2ft square timbers was also fairly common. This kind of construction is built to last and it does.<p>By comparison the largest driving factor in material selection on your average home construction project is cost. That's why you get vinyl siding, soft pine 2x4's, and the cheapest interior hardware money can buy. So in this instance innovation is a euphemism for selecting poor materials.

As a free, open-source piece of software, it effectively acts as a lubricant in the consumer electronics market. By eliminating the manufacturer's cost of building a device's operating system, Google have made it more affordable for both device manufacturers and consumers to effect smart mobile device transactions. So while it may not be strictly financially ""charitable"" for Google to do this, if we account for the non-financial value of these transactions, I think it's fair to say that an enormous amount of wealth has been created above and beyond what would otherwise have happened in a market that was only dominated by devices running non-free software, especially in countries that have populations that are generally too poor to afford the iPhone.",1311014960

Yes, similar things were said after every revolution like the industrial revolution or the invention of agriculture but what you have to realize is that once we got over those job issues they didn't simply vanish. With more and more efficiency from these revolutions comes more and more difficulties for the common worker who has no particular skill set. The real issue that this latest recession displayed is that people who are running these small businesses and even large corporations alike have learned what running ""lean"" really means. They have now realized their most bare essentials to make it through these hard economic times and now that the bar has been set it will be incredibly difficult to lift it to the previous level.<p>I had a discussion with a Fixed Income Desk Manager when I visited MorganStanley a few months back about this very issue and we both agreed that companies will never return to the previous level of employment. The job market is fundamentally changing and this idea that everyone has that jobs are around the corner I feel is naive. Could their possibly be an uptick in highly skilled areas of the market? I think so but besides those areas I think unskilled laborers are in for a difficult time. There will always be room in the economy for people that can do hands on jobs because somethings cannot be left up to technology alone i.e. construction or landscaping but beside these things we are moving towards a more skilled society and I think the only way the economy improves is if older unskilled workers eventually leave the job market and make way for younger more technologically savvy employees.",1311013570

72635,story,,,1,3,imasr,"Are we part of the most elitist business?",,"Yet again, we find a post focused on drawing a line between the good programmer, and the bad one.
I think we should really be thinking how to become a better person and that does not come from stepping on everybody else, just to feed the ego.
I'm personally tired of lists of things not to do. Mistakes come from doing, and that's a fact of life, no matter in what profession you are. If the greatest minds of the world would have paid attention to this ""don't do"" lists, we'd still be living in caverns.",1193341974
72634,comment,72357,72416,0,0,stuki,,,"	It's worse than that. Simply by operating shitty public schools 'for free', the ruling riff-raff is crowding out investment in private alternatives for the less than well off. With no public schools available and minimal to no regulation of private ones, every neighborhood would have private alternatives with plenty of eligible kids to fill them.<p>	I suspect well off neighborhoods would still in general have 'better' schools, simply due to having more resources, but even the poorest of parents would have at least some competitively exposed, hence at least decent, options. If nothing else, charity, churches and such would help out the neediest of kids.<p>	As it stands now, a poor parent in an inner city (even more so in one as much at war with religious anything at all as Oakland), is pretty much left without viable alternatives to the local public indoctrination institutions.

72632,comment,72615,72615,0,0,abstractbill,,,"For anyone wanting to make their searches fast, I would strongly recommend ditching the database.<p>Write a program that sucks your entire database into memory (memory is cheap - unless you really have <i>tons</i> of data, you can afford to do this).  Store records as objects or more simple structures, and index them in hash-tables.  When you get a query, just look up the objects using the query as a set of keys into your hash-tables.  If you take advantage of your knowledge of the data, you'll be able to do any intersections, filtering and sorting way faster than the database can.<p>This is how I did things when I rewrote justin.tv's search engine.  The bulk of the work took me two days, and it's <i>fast</i> (it'll be live in a few days, when we let our designer loose on it - right now it's functional but ugly).",1193341403

But when writing about how to develop successful software, it tends to be things that would resonate with frustrated enterprise software programmers, like he used to be, or guys like Scoble perhaps.  But his theme is similar to PG's,  concentrating on making it possible to develop software using programmers with average talent will not result in exceptionally useful software programs.",1193341284

If they paid the same amount and didn't get the equity, would FB still we worth $15b?  <p>Paying $240m to secure their ad relationship may have been a good deal in and of itself.

72628,comment,72606,72621,0,0,brlewis,,,"I don't think Richard Gabriel nailed the genesis of worse-is-better popularity.  If valuing implementation simplicity above all else were it, then Scheme would be very popular.  Unix and C became more popular than Lisp by running fast on cheaper hardware.  For a long time Lisp has run fast on cheap hardware, but it's still not popular.<p>But if either simplicity of implementation or speed were necessary preconditions of popularity, how would Java have become so popular?  Marketing?  If marketing is what matters, how did Java (in its C# incarnation) displace Visual Basic?<p>Any time I hear someone say ""Lisp would be popular except for problem X"" I think of some other computer language that became popular despite problem X.  Even its supposedly problematic syntax.  Look at XML; it's popular, and has a syntax pretty much like s-expressions only worse.<p>Complexity of implementation?  Slowness?  Lack of marketing?  Unfamiliar syntax?  No, none of these explain the lack of popularity.  Someday somebody will hit on what the real roadblock is and remove it, probably by accident.",1193340743

Is it asking for the particular documents, or is it the request for meaningful information?<p>It's sort of like a woman who asks you what car you drive right off the bat, on the first date. It indicates she is only in it for the money. And that she also lacks the social intelligence necessary to gain information without revealing that she's only in it for the money.<p>For a startup to succeed its people need to be a bit irrational. A pure profit maximizing strategy for a good developer is just to do something boring at Google. You aren't joining a startup to do median case profit maximization, you're doing it to (a) do something interesting for a change and (b) have a shot at a big payday.<p>Now, there's a certain undercurrent here at HN that says ""F you, pay me"". OK, but this is not the type of personality that is likely to build something great. They are the first ones to bail when things get rough, the first ones to trash their former (or current) employers, the first ones to lay blame.<p>There is a role for highly skilled mercenaries, just as there is a role for really beautiful golddiggers. But they should gravitate to Google/really rich men, as that's where they'll find a mutually satisfactory exchange.",1324335495

3371380,comment,3370766,3371342,3,0,ComputerGuru,,,"The only ""safe"" .NET framework to use for development is version 2.0. Thankfully, with VS2010 you can compile C# 4.0 (the language version) against the .NET 2.0 Framework.<p>Since 2.0, Microsoft has engaged in random ""experiments"" with the .NET framework, taking it in random directions then killing those projects off and starting again. XAML/WPF is the best example, where Microsoft begged the world to stop using System.Windows.Forms (standard Windows widgets/controls) and to switch over to vector-based XAML/WPF where each project needs a developer + a completely separate designer to have any chance of making a half-decent looking project.<p>Some developers (myself included) never made the switch - good call, because today WPF is dead thanks to a) it was a stupid call in the first place and b) it was very badly implemented, introducing incredible lag, requiring lots of memory, and generally resulting in a bad user experience.<p>Their other problem is with distribution/versioning. New versions of .NET tend to be released a month or so after new versions of Windows - meaning you'll never get Windows shipping out of the box with the latest version of .NET. While backwards compatibility is preserved (i.e. .NET 3.5 will run .NET 2.0 apps), it's very subtly broken as you'll find that a .NET 2.0 app compiled with VS2010 will actually not run on an actual .NET 2.0 distribution because no one bothered to check if the same method signatures existed for certain functions and whatnot.<p>Now the new challenge is Windows 8: first, Microsoft seems to be leaving .NET entirely pushing their new Metro toolkit and WinRT as the preferred routes of development. IMHO this will be a complete failure as it leaves behind both the .NET developers AND the traditional, hard-core WIN32 developers in an attempt at a ""clean slate"" that no one actually wants.<p>Even worse, .NET 4.0 in Windows 8 breaks all that backwards compatibility. Out of the box, it will not run apps compiled for .NET 3.5 and below - all .NET apps need to be recompiled to run on .NET 4, or the user will need to install .NET 3.5.<p>Footnote: Unfortunately, Microsoft's other good feature for .NET, Linq, was introduced in v3.5 of the .NET Framework. If you're targeting Framework 2.0, this is the one good feature you'll miss out on.",1324333496

They don't have the iPhone (and are unlikely to get it, due to working on a different set of 3G frequencies). They don't have any plans for LTE deployment, unlike AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint. Their parent company wants to get rid of them.<p>To me, this just seems like the government has done very little here for consumers, they will still likely end up with only 2-3 carriers. Why is it better for consumers if T-mobile just dies out rather than is bought to improve AT&T? (Also, many people think AT&T has a worse network than Verizon. Wouldn't this deal have, then, increased competition?)",1324332300

Doing the wrong thing with JS prototypes is easier than doing the right thing, which leads many developers to simply throw up their hands, and write code like this instead:<p><pre><code>    function makeHorse() {\n      var horse = {\n        walk:   function(){ ... },\n        trot:   function(){ ... },\n        canter: function(){ ... },\n        gallop: function(){ ... }\n      };\n      return horse;\n    };\n</code></pre>\n... which is terribly inefficient and wasteful of memory, and accomplishes nothing that a prototype couldn't do in a small fraction of the space and time.",1324332198

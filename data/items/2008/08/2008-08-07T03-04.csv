269360,comment,269317,269317,0,0,netcan,,,"The 'is it alive' was always the sort of semantic bickering that biologists have always been prone to. Like all that arguing about classification (going back centuries). I don't mean when it's arguing about facts or their interpretation. As often as not it's just about naming conventions.<p>Anyway, 'is it alive' is not an interesting question. That's just about defining 'organism.' Like defining, human or mammal, there has to be some grey area.<p>'Is it life' might be a better one. Because then you are talking about something that has consequences. In the absence of 'true organisms' can viruses themselves start an evolutionary chain? This discovery might mean that they can.",1218081578

People compare numbers saying ""oh I can get this from dell with the same processor and memory and harddrive for half the price!"" but neglect several things:<p>-Almost all those inexpensive PCs are significantly heavier than the macbook.<p>-The screens are not as good as the macs, at all. Even at the same resolution the macs have better backlighting and better color & contrast.<p>-The macs have better battery life.<p>Show me a PC that weighs 5 lbs or less, gets 5 hrs of battery life and has a screen as nice as the macbook for the same or less money. They don't exist.<p>You can get a Sony with all these qualities except the price.<p>You can get a Dell with all these qualities except the battery life and nice screen. (Or you can get a nice screen in a machine that weighs 6+lbs and still has terrible battery life).<p>You can get a Lenovo with all these qualities but the screens are awful.<p>And so on.",1218081055

269333,comment,268633,268633,0,0,niqolas,,,"Face it – arguing over computers is futile.<p>Certain characteristics simply hold more value to some individuals over others, which is why some people choose to share their lives with blondes and others with brunettes or redheads. Similarly, some people choose to have Macs; while others choose Windows or Linux.<p>Suggestions that WomanA is ""better"" than WomanB are incredibly subjective e.g. a 5/10 to you might be a 10/10 to someone else. Although such suggestions can promote passionate discourse (as in this thread), inevitably the arguments that ensue end in deadlock - where you realise that no matter how much you argue, you and your critics will never see eye to eye.<p>Quoting hardware specifications is like saying ""she's an X out of 10” and running Windows, Linux or OSX is like preferring blondes, brunettes or redheads.<p>Hackers, it’s time to agree to disagree - because we all like to think we’re spending our lives with babes.",1218079462

The first SUVs were done by Jeep and Land Rover, and the ""modern"" SUV craze is usually credited to the Jeep Cherokee.  Toyota beat GM out with an SUV as well.<p>GMs never <i>really</i> been an innovator, at least as far as cars go - the company was formed as a conglomerate of several existing carmakers and their suppliers.  Their main innovations have been in marketing and internal organization: they pioneered the approach of having multiple nameplates, each targeting a specific socioeconomic strata.<p>As for the Volt, it's cool but I've yet to see any reason to believe it'll be better than the Prius, and given GMs reliability reputation, I see a lot of reason to believe the Prius will be better than it.",1218079443

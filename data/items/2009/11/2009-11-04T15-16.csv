Faced with a slowly-dying ancient Win98 laptop as her only computer and doing all the business's finances on paper, a few months ago I donated a slightly less ancient Dell laptop and a second-hand desktop box, after installing Ubuntu on both (the desktop also included a minimalist PoS system that I wrote over a few weekends, plus stuff like GNUCash already installed).<p>Talking to her since then, both machines seem to be giving her far fewer headaches than the Windows 98 box did, and despite me fishing for any complaints she seems perfectly happy with Ubuntu. For context, her level of technical sophistication is around the level of ""knows the difference between hard drives and RAM, and writes HTML by hand (using table layouts)"", so better than the average guy off the street but nowhere near stereotypical bearded Linux users (such as, um, myself).<p>So, what makes Linux work for her? 1) Support from a family member, though apparently so far everything just works 2) No requirements to use Windows-only software or unusual hardware 3) Extremely limited financial resources, combined with not using the typical means that reduce Windows' TCO to match Linux (bulk/academic discounts, hiding the cost in the price of new hardware, getting pirated copies, etc.).<p>These three factors are certainly not unique, but the combination is somewhat unusual, and I doubt <i>any</i> amount of aggressive word-of-mouth marketing from Linux geeks is going to get people using it without those factors.",1257349668

The MacKay book, ""Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms,"" already referenced by benm is quite good, but I'd suggest on top of it Larry Wasserman's amazing book, ""All of Statistics"". If the level of calculus and linear calculus in that book is too much for you, you might need to review that material first before moving on to anything sophisticated in statistics.<p>In the interim, you could start with David Freedman's ""Statistics"" (written along with Pisani and Purves) to at least get a feel for the basic ideas of statistics from one of the great statistical writers of the 20th century.<p>If there are other things you want to learn about, I'd be happy to make suggestions, as I went in the opposite direction as you're trying to go now, having been a math major as an undergrad who picked up CS along the way.

921807,comment,921165,921700,0,0,FooBarWidget,,,"Not quite. Current Linux packaging formats encourage the developer to build one package per architecture. This means presenting several download choices for the user which can be confusing. The user doesn't always know what his architecture is.<p>The problem can be solved in two ways:<p>1) Distributing through a repository and have the package manager auto-select the architecture. However this is highly distribution-specific. If you want to build a single tar.gz that works on the majority of the Linux distros then you're out of luck.<p>2) Compile binaries for multiple architectures and bundle everything into the same package, and have a shell script or whatever select the correct binary.<p>While (2) is entirely doable and does not confuse the end user, it does make the developer's job harder. He has to compile binaries multiple times and spend a lot of effort on packaging. Having support for universal binaries throughout the entire system, including the developer toolchain, solves not only confusion for the end user but also hassle for the developer. On OS X I can type ""gcc -arch i386 -arch ppc"" and it'll generate a universal binary with two architectures. I don't have to spend time setting up a PPC virtual machine with a development environment in it, or to setup a cross compiler, just to compile binaries for PPC; everything is right there.<p>I think the ultimate point is not to make impossible things possible, but to make already possible things easier, for both end users and app developers.",1257348067

Doing so sometimes requires using force against oppressive governments.<p>Yet on the other hand, the UN seeks to protect the sovereignty of the world's nations. How can it protect the sovereignty of a nation against whom it is fighting due to its other mission?<p>When its soul is built on two mutually contradictory ideals, it can never be anything but a schizophrenic wreck with at least one of those ideals (and more likely, both of them).",1257347811

I'd love to give one of these things a try for a bit just to see how it works.<p>The Twitter Peek is pretty funny when you consider that it will probably sell. I use Twitter more like an IM client these days than anything else. Its immediate, public and private at the same time.

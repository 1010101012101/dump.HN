The TCP/IP spec is open to all - if you want to build a network or device that talks TCP/IP there&#x27;s the specification, have at it. The open nature of internet and web protocols helped make the modern internet possible. We should not be so quick to shut the door on such a rich and productive legacy. (Or, at least, refrain from writing hyperbolic headlines).<p>That being said - a company selling an alternate, high-performance networking protocol could have a strong market.

The University of Utah and Brigham Young University provided the tech talent that really didn&#x27;t want to leave the state, and WP and Novel provided the jobs and, ultimately, the capital that started many of the companies south of Salt Lake City that turned the area into a tech hub (the UofU&#x27;s graphics program was crucial to companies like Evans and Sutherland further north).<p>It is unfortunate that, today, we don&#x27;t have that kind of &quot;anchor&quot; company in our &quot;Valley&quot;. Omniture was starting to take on that role, but it sold to Adobe.

Even if you have a 128-bit random seed, that&#x27;s still nowhere near enough. You need at least a log2(52!) = 226 bit seed to cover all orderings, even assuming every seed produces a unique sequence of numbers, by the pigeonhole principle.<p>And it&#x27;s even worse than that. Say you have a 226 bit seed. Well, you <i>still</i> won&#x27;t have a uniform distribution. Why? Because 52! does not evenly divide 2^226. Even assuming a &quot;perfect&quot; PRNG (again: where every seed produces a unique sequence of numbers), you&#x27;ll end up hitting some deck orderings less than others. In this case, it&#x27;s a difference between some deck orderings being hit once and others being hit twice - which can make a big difference! You can mitigate this by either discarding and reinitializing your PRNG if the initial seed is >= 52!, or just choosing a bit length long enough that the effect becomes minimal.<p>It&#x27;s like trying to pick a number between 0 and 45 with a 100 sided die - if you just take the number rolled mod 45, you&#x27;ll end up with 0 through 9 picked more often than they should be. Instead, you have to roll until you get a number between 0 and 89, inclusive, then take mod 45.<p>(Oh, and as for the response of &quot;just pick a larger seed&quot;, say you have a card game played with 4 decks (for example Shanghai rum with a bunch of players). Then you need a seed length of >=1307 bits. I cannot think of any PRNGs with a seed that large.)",1407790024

Customers have become conditioned to expect prices that are too low to sustain the market.<p>The three items above have led to an end state where large publishers who can afford the marketing spend hire armies of low-skilled developers to develop hundreds of games in hopes that one or two of them are wildly popular. If the game isn&#x27;t popular, you can just swap out the pixel art for new assets and release the game as a new product.<p>Free-to-play is the new hotness in gaming, but a successful F2P game is basically a marketing platform in disguise.

I just raised prices and watched what happened.&quot;<p>Not enough startups do this on a regular basis. They&#x27;re too worried about losing clients. If you don&#x27;t reinforce your value proposition on a regular basis by adding features, you will lose customer regardless.<p>With several of my side projects, I would add a new feature, then raise prices for new customers. At the same time, clients who renewed (I used a subscription based model) would get a discount. It was like magic. More people wanted in earlier, instead of waiting for a more mature, more expensive product. They gladly paid a lower monthly fee up front, in order to avoid the increase in price later on.",1407789485

For people who don&#x27;t want to deal with the Xbox One/Playstation 4 monocultures, there&#x27;s PC gaming. It already exists. The people who choose consoles over PC gaming choose it because it&#x27;s more convenient. And that convenience derives in large part from the monoculture (or duoculture, I guess). Low-overhead bare metal programming is what enables the relatively long life of most consoles compared to PC gaming, because developers have time to learn how to get the absolute best performance out of a particular hardware configuration. It costs less money up-front in hardware costs, and it&#x27;s a lot less work to figure out if a game will work on your system or not (almost no work, actually).",1407789197

For N > 2, you just need to show that each of 1 through N has an equal chance of getting the k-th slot for 1 through N. In the first step, every number has a 1/N probability of getting into the first slot. For all other slots: the number has (1-1/N) chance of getting/staying there, then by induction, all slots are equally likely, hence (1-1/N)*1/(N-1) = 1/N. This completes the proof.&quot;",1407788072

Then what happens to the company that had their employee taken away?<p>As a hiring manager?  that is not my concern.   But from a societal perspective, there are a few things the company that is outbid can do.<p>1. they can raise their own wages.<p>Note, this does increase the availability of workers through several mechanisms.  most obviously, more people will enter the field as wages go up, but that takes a while.  More immediately?  you have people that have the skills who can also do another job.<p>For example, my partner does embedded linux development, mostly on arm.   But, my partner could also do my job (I&#x27;m a SysAdmin) - and usually do it rather better than I am.   Right now, the embedded stuff pays about 10% more than the sort of sysadmin gigs I can get, reflecting the required skills.   But if there were suddenly more demand for SysAdmins?   if you paid enough, I&#x27;m sure you could get my partner to take a SysAdmin job.<p>This is an important part of how Capitalisim allocates labor efficiently.  Yeah, I could work as an apprentice motorcycle mechanic.   I&#x27;m probably pretty good, I mean, for an apprentice.   I&#x27;m not at journeyman level yet.   If being a motorcycle mechanic paid better than being a SysAdmin?  I&#x27;d probably spend the time and effort to get my motorcycle repair skills up to snuff.<p>2. they can train.<p>This increases the pool of workers rather more quickly than increasing wages.   This is what I do when I need to hire technical people, and I can&#x27;t afford market rates.  Find people that you think have the attributes to do the job, once they have some help and practice.<p>From a corporate perspective, both of these things are just a matter of money.

Reasonably, she takes an extra 5 minutes at the end of her teabreak.  Bob sees her, and joins her, getting an extra 5 minutes.  If this happens more than once or twice you risk complete breakdown in teabreaks, yet telling Ann to take her breaks on time means you&#x27;re an asshole.

That&#x27;s the sort of résumé-enhancing title that will bring you literally as much money as you want for the rest of your natural life.<p>What can you do with it? Do your stint in government, then hang out your shingle as a private consultant. That very day, Fortune 500s will start pointing firehoses spewing money at you in exchange for &quot;consultations&quot; where you parachute in to tell them all their problems are due to their IT staff being idiots. Your White House title will give you unimpeachable (heh) credibility in their eyes.

8164931,comment,8164408,8164563,31,0,btoptical,,,"Nope, the new fiber will be high dispersion compared to the old fiber and also will not have dispersion compensation along its length.  The old cable was designed for OOK signaling.  Previously optical signaling was 1 bit per symbol OOK (on-off-keying) and direct detection meaning you did not have any optical phase information to make dispersion corrections so the dispersion compensation was done in a specially designed fiber with the opposite sign slope for dispersion (DCF).<p>This fiber was also relatively high loss and has a narrower core which leads to higher nonlinearities in the link.  The old cable tries to keep the dispersion within the range that OOK technologies can operate error-free (post FEC) so there&#x27;s a lot of it typical at each repeater (EDFA).  The newer coherent optical technology can transmit multiple bits per symbol (BPSK, QPSK) by encoding the bits in the optical phase.  Since the phase is recovered at the receiver the dispersion accumulated in the fiber can be undone in DSP with a long enough FIR filter.  So the need for dispersion compensation is gone with coherent optical.  Taking out the DCF also reduces loss along the link reducing EDFA (amplifier) count and increasing spacing.  Also nonlinear penalties on the newer higher dispersion fiber are lower which improves something called cycle slips that can punch through the FEC and cause you to take post-FEC errors.<p>The net result is that you should be able to transmit QPSK at 32GBd in 2 polarizations in maybe 80 waves in each direction.<p>2bits x 2 polarizations x 32G ~128Gb/s per wave or nearly 11Tb/s for 1 fiber.

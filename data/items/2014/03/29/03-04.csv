My guess is that maybe you are testing now to see what type of demand there might be? I think some type of note on pricing would be helpful (even if it is somethings like &quot;currently free for beta testers but we plan to start charging from x date&quot;).",1396065516

7491357,comment,7489870,7490548,2,0,6cxs2hd6,,,"As a founder I <i>loved</i> to get feedback like this. Was I proud of some feature or design that I&#x27;d worked hard on? That&#x27;s nice, but if it&#x27;s not working for customers, it&#x27;s not working. Swallow pride, move on.<p>Although that&#x27;s a healthy attitude, it gets tricky when the company grows and the customer is criticizing work done by your employees. Your instinct is still that the customer is automatically right, and that&#x27;s still true, but you have to be less blunt with employees than you&#x27;d be with yourself. You need to acknowledge their work was good, we just need to try something different. Regardless, they need to hear and act on it. And there is <i>no way</i> you call a customer a &quot;prick&quot;, for offering polite feedback like in that video. You thank them.<p>Sometimes I&#x27;d remind folks that it wasn&#x27;t me, it was our customers who were paying for our salaries, the office around us, the chairs we&#x27;re sitting on. Ultimately the customers are the boss, not me.<p>Edit: If you have investors, now you have two bosses.",1396065483

7491328,comment,7491031,7491233,6,0,kleinsch,,,"I&#x27;ve been doing this full-time for the last year. It&#x27;s worked well for me in the SF area because it&#x27;s a lot easier to get in the door for new companies/products than with established companies that already have dev teams. I also like working on brand new products and technologies and startups are great for that. :)<p>The main lesson I&#x27;ve learned working with startups is that consulting is always easier working for people that are spending other people&#x27;s money. The guy who spent the last year saving $10K of his personal earnings to build his genius daily deals for big data social mobile app? He&#x27;s going to try to squeeze you for everything he can get. The startup that raised a $1.5MM series A? Going to treat dealings like a business negotiation and probably be less emotional to deal with.<p>That being said, you still want to manage risk based on who you&#x27;re dealing with. If I&#x27;m consulting for a company with $50MM in revenues and 200 employees, I&#x27;m not worried about them going under tomorrow, so I&#x27;ll let them pay me monthly net-30. If I&#x27;m consulting for a 5 person startup that&#x27;s operating on a seed round, I&#x27;ll usually require weekly net-7 or net-15. I&#x27;ve started avoiding companies that seem sketchy or are operating off personal savings, but if I was going to work with those types of clients in the future, I&#x27;d do a prepaid retainer.<p>Of course, this varies on a case-by-case basis so YMMV.",1396064751

7491312,comment,7491207,7491207,1,0,gexla,,,"Compsci is probably among the more time intensive degrees you could be shooting for. It&#x27;s heavy on math requirements, which requires a lot of practice to fully understand. The degree is also relatively rigid in its structure of requirements. You need math classes throughout and they all build on each other. The compsci courses also build on each other. The math classes are also requirements for the compsci classes. It&#x27;s real easy to screw up a semester (can&#x27;t get into a class because it&#x27;s full, have to drop a class, can&#x27;t take all the classes you need because of the load) and throw everything out of whack. It&#x27;s easy for a full time student to end up with a 5 year schedule, let alone someone who has to work full time.<p>If you are just looking for a piece of paper, then perhaps something Xbusiness would be better.<p>As to the value of the degree itself. I don&#x27;t know. You have been on a career track without it and you have been fine so far. Having a degree probably opens up your options, but it&#x27;s not the driver. There may be opportunities you can&#x27;t pursue because of a lack of a degree. But as long as you still have options, then it&#x27;s not a problem. In the tech field, it&#x27;s more about what you know and your network rather than having a degree. A more important consideration might be getting a work visa for the U.S. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s easier to get a visa while having a degree. This is something you will have to look into.<p>I don&#x27;t know that self study would solve anything. You have to put in X hours to pass a subject and you probably have to put in that time either through self study or while taking an actual course. You could self study before the course to pass the course with less work, but you still had to put in the time before hand.<p>You might also need to take a close look at your study habits. Is there something you could be doing different? Is there a way that you could substantially reduce your work load in school? Maybe you could let your grades drop a bit in certain subjects by keeping up on the material but skipping certain time consuming assignments?<p>The bottom line is that you should have a certain idea of what you want to do and then do what you need to do to accomplish that. If you are starting a business which will require all your time, then something has to give. If the business is more important, then you will have to drop school. You have already made that decision once, what would be different in the future?<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t know that going to the bay area and having a degree in compsci is a requirement for making an impact. Maybe it would be better to get knowledge of a field outside of compsci so that you can apply your development skills to that field. The best opportunities for start-ups are probably in things that a typical compsci grad living in the bay area probably wouldn&#x27;t even think about because that person doesn&#x27;t have that exposure. That&#x27;s the area of unknown unknowns. Instead, you get a bunch of start-ups creating &quot;me too&quot; consumer apps that nobody cares about.<p>There are a lot of problems to be solved outside the bay area. The bay area may be a hub of tech activity, but just as important are the outposts. For example, Uber is a service which supports a limited number of metro areas in the U.S. while WhatsApp aims to service the entire globe. I live in the Philippines are there are lots of problems to be solved here that people in the bay area don&#x27;t know about. Bill Gates would never have got his idea for his foundation if he had never visited Africa.<p>So, lots of approaches and limited time. Use it wisely. ;)",1396064315

7491293,comment,7490151,7491173,0,0,zAy0LfpBZLC8mAC,,,"Yes, the distinction is important, but this obviously is all about the legal part - the state has no business in discriminating between sexual orientations, so the state has to either offer marriage for everyone or not at all, and the same for &quot;civil unions&quot;.<p>Also, I think it is confusing to say &quot;cultural customs and rituals are not rights and don&#x27;t have to be inclusive.&quot; That is largely correct from a legal perspective, but still makes for a bad society to live in. You probably legally can found a club for white people only, but it&#x27;s unlikely that that would be a nice club to be in. And also, just because something has a long tradition, that does not make it non-discriminatory.<p>Whether some gay people don&#x27;t want to marry obviously is completely irrelevant to the discussion, as this is not about forcing gay people to marry. This is about the freedom for those who want to, not about forcing those who don&#x27;t want to. And even if some gay people feel that it&#x27;s not appropriate for other gay people to marry, it&#x27;s not the job of the state to enforce that on those other gay people who actually do want to marry.<p>And I do agree that you don&#x27;t have to carry any ill-feelings towards blacks in order to want to preserve the traditional definition of who has to sit where on the bus. But that completely ignores that there are people with feelings on the other side as well - people who are excluded, people for whom sitting on &quot;black only&quot; seats is not just a quaint tradition. Those strong feelings about traditional roles do exist and totally are real, be it about the role of slaves, of black people, of women, ..., but that does not mean that living them does not hurt other people. We as a society can (and have to) force people to confront that they are actually causing harm with their clinging to traditional ideas, often for totally irrational reasons. That does not mean that we cannot empathize with those people who sincerely believe that they are losing something when giving up such strong-held beliefs and ideas, but we also can not accept that they hurt other people.<p>And, really, I would want to encourage you to re-read what you write, replacing everything in it that is about gays with black people and mixed marriages and other things that we have figured out a while back, try to read it as a sincere argument. You are used to the idea that marriage is a custom specific to heterosexuals. But you have to consider that people at some point were equally used to racial segregation. There were people using the exact same arguments back then, feeling equally right about how traditionally marriage was for &quot;people of the same race&quot;. And yet I would hope that the suggestion of a &quot;interracial union&quot; for those mixed couples who want to get more or less the same benefits that &quot;one-race couples&quot; enjoyed traditionally (so that the traditionalists can keep their tradition of what they perceive to be a real marriage) would seems utterly absurd and inappropriate to you. Then try to extrapolate from that perspective on the past to how you would view this current discussion as a person in the equally (not that) distant future. And then reconsider who is undeservedly labelled a bigot or ostracized.",1396063835

(How many operations in the instruction are taking things off the belt before I get my data?)  In the Mill the operations are parsed in parallel and they have all the information they need to start processing as soon as the the instruction (block) is loaded in the buffer.<p>The size of the belt is a very finely tuned constraint (using simulations) that basically depends on how many cycles you have to save a value to the scratchpad memory (if needed) before it &quot;drops off&quot; the belt.  There is a lecture that describes why it takes the number of cycles it does and if you watch it you will probably understand better why the Mill is not about what is easy or hard for the compiler but all about getting the silicon to jump through hoops fast and efficiently.",1396063726

Or rather, there are many good answers, but they depend on your personality, field of interest, motivation, etc. Personally I&#x27;m not a big fan of school because I&#x27;m really motivated to learn on my own, and in school I have to redo a lot of stuff I&#x27;ve done several years ago. A lot of people I&#x27;ve met in school don&#x27;t learn anything that isn&#x27;t presented to them in class, so it&#x27;s a valuable resource for them. Ideally, that divide would answer the question for you (shouldn&#x27;t it be enough to just show you know what you need to know?), but the world isn&#x27;t ideal.<p>I live in the US already, so this might not be as easy for you, but my impression is that as a programmer with good jobs and a portfolio (GitHub), I could probably get a job in silicon valley pretty easily. I might be able to get a higher paying job with a degree, but if I find something and work for a couple years, I&#x27;d probably be fine.<p>If you&#x27;re looking to move here, my impression is you have to have a company sponsor you, and that is probably harder without a degree, but not impossible. Since you&#x27;re in a college program, you might want to intern at a company here, and prove you&#x27;re someone they want to bring back.<p>But finally, there&#x27;s this: as a programmer, are you going to be homeless if you don&#x27;t have a degree? I really doubt it. So I may have lied a little when I said I wasn&#x27;t a big fan of school. I hate it. I wish I didn&#x27;t, but I do. I thought I could go back to school for a year to finish up, and just deal with the unhappiness. Maybe I could if I really wanted to, but I don&#x27;t. So maybe I&#x27;m making more obstacles for myself in the future, but the trade off is that I&#x27;m a lot happier right now.<p>So I guess I haven&#x27;t really answered your question for you, but hopefully my thought process helps you come to a conclusion for yourself. Also, why not find out right now? Look up some bay area companies you&#x27;d like to work for, and apply. If you get in, then no, you don&#x27;t need a degree.

7491237,comment,7491207,7491207,2,0,gm,,,"One thing: Different countries view college degrees differently. In some, if you do not have a college degree, you will not even get considered for the job, no matter what you&#x27;ve done.<p>It might affect work visas as well (some countries give a lot of weight to a college degree when assigning a priority to your application).<p>Of course, to get stuff done you do not need a degree and examples abound about people who &quot;made it&quot; without a college degree.  Granted, they learned everything on their own, so if you have a low motivation to learn stuff that&#x27;s important in your field but boring to you (for example, algorithms and data structures), you might want to get through the degree just to force you to learn stuff.<p>For me, I&#x27;m in the US, where college degrees matter relatively little, specially in tech. Still, I can say without a doubt my CS degree has opened many doors for me, even a couple decades after having gotten it. Also I have had to fight far less to get good salary offers. Once people know I have a CS degree, we move onto the advanced stuff instead of them trying to see if I&#x27;m an idiot or not.<p>That&#x27;s my $0.02, your mileage may vary.",1396062216

Also seems to be in the same price range, and you end up with a full blown PC (which may not be what you&#x27;re shooting for).  One more thing that I liked is how natural it was to use one note to make notes, cut a part out, and move it around.  When I&#x27;m sketching ideas out, or learning math stuff, it&#x27;s always nice to be able to move a snippet over really quickly.<p>I also used to review and edit a lot of training materials that were being designed, and I was using an ipad 2 with PDFExpert, which was pretty great for that, but I always hated how crap the ipad was for writing things with a stylus or a finger.  If I could go back and do it again with a surface pro 2, I would in a heartbeat.<p>I tried other larger form factor e-ink devices like the Kindle DX and such, but if the screen wasn&#x27;t big enough to fit the entire page on the screen at once, it didn&#x27;t matter how big the screen was.  The device just ended up being too slow.  I liked the ipad because I could swipe around, highlight, circle things, make notes, etc.<p>Obviously the battery life on the surface pro 2 wouldn&#x27;t be in the same universe as this thing, and it&#x27;s bulkier, but just thought I&#x27;d throw it out there.  Kind of rambly, heh, YMMV",1396062103

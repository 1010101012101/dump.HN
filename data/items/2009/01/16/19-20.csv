There are huge numbers of people with high IQs who accomplish little.

437167,comment,436870,437001,0,0,dasil003,,,"It just depends where you are in terms of experience.  It's not that one is good or bad.  PHP is easy to understand, and you can jump right into it with no experience.  However over time if you have any potential as a serious programmer you will find the pain points and repetitive tasks.<p>In many ways, experienced programmers and language elitists are a lot like corporations.  They are risk-averse.  The reason best practices are what they are is to avoid known problems (sort of like bureaucracy).  This will make you a better programmer to a certain point, but it's also so easy to overestimate risk.  The painful truth is that a 20-year-old hacker figuring out things as he goes may be able to plow through the naive problems he inevitably creates and arrive at a finished, valuable product faster than a seasoned developer who writes uber-maintainable code with a comprehensive test suite and every best practice he can lay his hands on.",1232135562

437155,comment,436989,436989,0,0,sokoloff,,,"I wonder if selectable inertial separator would work on turbofans. (They are installed on single-engine PT-6 turboprops.) Imagine a system that requires air to make a sharp turn, but anything with significant mass (water, ice, birds) would pass through, or get ground up against something other fan blades. I couldn't find a good diagram online.<p>You would want them to be selectable (engaged during low-altitude flight, stowed during cruise flight) so as to hopefully not unduly hurt range, other than via the increased weight.<p>The problem though is that there are significant one-engine-out climb performance targets that must be met for Part 21 certification, and inertial separators have power penalties on top of the weight penalty. Taking performance away from a one-engine-out scenario would further restrict max take-off weights, increase balanced field lengths (meaning some airports would need to make improvements to serve some aircraft, etc), increase the time from roll to V1 (the takeoff commit speed) and at the end of the day, taking performance away may represent a higher risk than birds currently represent.<p>In 700 hours or so of single-engine piston flight, I've struck two (small) birds, and had close calls with half-dozen more. I've never had a close call with a bird over 2000 feet AGL, so cruise flight could surely be done without brid protection.",1232135191

437140,comment,436870,436870,0,0,martythemaniak,,,"To summarize it, I would say PHP is the ""get shit done"" language. It allows people who are just starting out with programming or people who aren't very technical to focus on what they need to have, rather than on the best way to do something. This is why so many websites (Flickr) and OS pieces of software are in PHP - they focused heavily on what users would be seeing, rather than what developers would be seeing and won out.<p>Of course, PHP doesn't preclude good design either. Once you have a working product that is excellent on the outside but ugly on the inside, you can start spending more time refactoring your code, or even slowly migrating your system piece-by-piece to another platform.",1232134519

Cacioppo and William Patrick. It quotes a lot of studies that statistically link feeling disconnected with all sorts of things you want to avoid, including health problems.<p>Of course, instead of having friends, you can try to avoid loneliness by getting rid of your social needs, in a kind of ascetism. I never managed to do that. On the other hand I read that Alexander Selkirk, the stranded sailor who inspired Robinson Crusoe, suffered terribly from loneliness the first one and a half years, but then got over it completely. Later, back in Scotland, he even regretted his time on the island. I was wondering if this story was true, and if there were other examples.",1232134461

437088,comment,436870,436930,0,0,KrisJordan,,,"Agree with your additions completely and would amend your #3 to say that PHP was big on re-use in the small, as well. I've known folks starting out with PHP who cobble a script together by copy-pasting snippets of code from here and there. Inelegant, yes, but when you are working on a small project it was usually effective.<p>This leads me to one point about PHP's documentation that I was surprised not to see. Their documentation has always (as long as I can remember, at least) had public comments. On many occasions questions I have had or example code I needed was crowdsourced by the public and located in-line below the function reference. I have been surprised other platforms don't make more extensive use of this.<p>Finally, in response to your ""I guess I'm looking for something else."" Understand your discontent - I've felt it myself over the past couple years and have found myself toying with Djagno, et. al. This fall I found myself returning to PHP with a mission to create a framework that I could use and not feel shamed to be in PHP. It's still early in development (4 months) but I believe it is looking good and getting exciting.

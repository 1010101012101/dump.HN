If the livelyhood of your entire business depends on the secrecy required (for marketing purposes) by companies from the UNITED STATES, then I think it is reasonable that you will take steps to stop people from standing outside and photographing into your company.<p>And they did not try to execute the man or put him on a prison in an island for 5 years without trial, they just took steps to make sure he did not have pictures that would compromise their factory.<p>Tens of thousands of people owe their daily bread to the secrecy. In this idealistic world view promoted by the article, kicking a man in the leg is a worse crime than letting 10 thousand people lose their job.<p>In the U.S, guards routinely shoot 10.000 volts of current into people.

In both fixed limit and NL variants, a competent player will raise close to 100% of his range preflop.

It's more flexible and concise than a templating library, and it forces you to bear in mind the separation of content and presentation. In turn, this makes it easier to unit-test the views, and to write automated integration tests.<p>For instance, if I were a designer writing a template, I have control over both the CSS and the HTML. This might tempt me to write the HTML around a particular design:<p><pre><code>  <div class=""post"">\n    <div class=""small"">\n      <%= post.points %> points by <%= author.name %>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</code></pre>\nBut if I am a programmer, without necessarily much knowledge of the presentation, I might be more careful to write more semantic HTML that's presentation-neutral.<p><pre><code>  [:div.post {:id (str ""post-"" (:id post))}\n    [:div.header\n      [:span.points (:points post)]\n      "" points by ""\n      [:span.author (:name author)]]\n</code></pre>\nWhich has the useful side effect of making it easier to write tests:<p><pre><code>  (is (= (css-select ""#post-1 .author"" (:body response))\n         ""Test User""))</code></pre>",1266494788

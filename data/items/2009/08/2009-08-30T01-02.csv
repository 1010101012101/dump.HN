793931,comment,793810,793810,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I am concerned by the public's changing mood, in regards to entrepreneurs. In the 1970s the American government began the process of deregulation, which allowed some important innovations in the industries that were deregulated. Transportation was probably the first big industry effected, followed by many others.<p>My impression was that there was a stretch when some combination of the public mood and the government's emphasis conspired to encourage small startups. The 1980s and 1990s were clearly good in this respect.<p>The mood of the last decade has been increasingly punitive. An increasingly harsh attitude toward flexibility in the law has been evident elsewhere for some time, but in the last 10 years that attitude has increasingly been expressed in the field of business. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is the most evident expression of the new trend - what once would have been treated as a civil matter is now treated as a criminal matter.<p>At some point during the next 30 years I expect breakthroughs in biology to allow for a new wave of startups, if the government and the public allow those startups to exist. In matters relating to health, it is worrisome to consider what a punitive legal attitude means -  a medical treatment that fails to perform leads to jailtime, rather than a lawsuit.<p>I think it is urgent that everyone who cares about entreprenurial culture in America to make the argument, to their friends and to strangers, that innovation in business depends in part on tolerance, and that, in practical terms, this means most matters of conflict should be treated as civil rather than criminal cases.<p>Once upon a time, before the mid 1800s, most Western countries treated bankruptcy as a criminal matter, rather than a civil one. The liberalization of bankruptcy law was one of the factors that allowed our modern economies to gain the dynamic nature they now enjoy. I would guess that most of us know someone who has tried to do a startup, failed on their first attempt, and then later met with greater success on successive tries. Tolerance of failure is the first pre-requisite of a dynamic economy.<p>Since the public seems at risk of forgetting this fact, we all need to make that case, to whoever is willing to listen.",1251597033

You need to put together a solid, total package, and don't forget 18%/year in maintenance. If your clients are getting funding from an outside source on this, you need to grease the skids. There are people who do nothing but set up and administer grants. If you can hook up with one of them, you're golden.<p>The best way to learn to sell is to do it. Try to find yourself a mentor you can talk to about it, and just go for it.

I like SPIN Selling by Rackham; it's researched, reasonable, and most other solution selling books that came out afterward just repackage Rackham's results. I like Jeffrey Gitomer's Little Red Book of Selling. It's mostly about maintaining a positive attitude while people are telling you no. This is necessary, because selling is a goddamn emotional roller coaster. Watch out for books aimed at the hard sell. You can't hard sell a university.<p>Good luck!",1251594302

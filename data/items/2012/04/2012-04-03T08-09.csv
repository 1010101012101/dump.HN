Several years ago our female Prime Minister pushed through laws completely legalizing prostitution.  It's just a job; maybe not a very nice job, but a fairly high paying one.  They pay tax, are protected by police, and have to follow health and safety laws.  And given our generous welfare net, nobody is ever even forced into prostitution to eat.<p>Do you think getting a haircut at a barbershop is consensual?  If so, then what's the difference?<p>Your idea of prostitution is filtered through the lens of your own experiences.  In America and other repressed countries, it's probably a good idea to assume that prostitution is not consensual; there is indeed coercion and violence, which is absolutely inexcusable and disgusting.  But America is not the world, and you need to drop the rediculous sweeping universal statements.",1333443535

3792110,comment,3791545,3792080,31,0,Lazare,,,"I'm actually a little confused.  You list some very negative things, which I strongly deplore, and then you say it ""isn't LSL's fault, but it certainly isn't helping"".  Those are, indeed, very negative things!  But...<p>A lot of things can be described as not being at fault, but not helping reduce the number sexual assaults in America.  Apple pie.  The Toyota corporation.  Cows.  Vegetarians.  The colour blue.  If LSL really isn't at fault, as you say, then why is it problematic that it isn't helping?  Just because it has sexual content?  I don't understand.  Doesn't your criticism apply to, well...almost everything in life?  (But especially almost every PG or higher rates movie and a huge number of television shows?  Most of which have vastly higher budgets?)<p>(There's also, of course, the question of whether this is even a useful avenue of attack.  There is some - confusing and contradictory, admittedly - evidence that violent games reduce violent crime, and pornography reduces sexual assaults.  We have a lot of experience trying to repress basic human nature, and we have very little evidence that it ever works.)<p>Edit @rogerbruan:  I've certainly been accused of being overly literal before. :) Still...<p>The original comment said that LSL isn't at fault. You're saying that it is a part of problem. I'm not sure how to square those two ideas. Either LSL fosters sexism, rape culture, and sexual assaults, or it doesn't. If it does, then it's at least partly at fault for these ills, and if it's not, then it's not bad for society, right?  Still, I think you're broadly right:  The original commenter was <i>trying</i> to blame LSL, and just phrased it oddly.",1333443206

The first step in solving this problem would be to compare the situation in the US, with the situation in countries where prostitution is legal and in the open.  Are things better there? If so are there lessons that can be drawn from this?  Trafficking is abhorrent and must be fought at all fronts, but forcing things further and further underground is not the solution for bringing the problem to light.  Make it legal, bring it out into the open and regulate it.  It won't make things perfect, and I'm not so naive that I think it would completely end all trafficking, but I do believe it will make things a whole lot better.",1333441094

Tasks that used to be major undertakings often boiled down to simple scripts. Python, Ruby and many other languages since have borrowed from and built upon the brevity that Perl first showed us and it&#x27;s unlikely that people will ever go back to the verbosity that used to be common for text processing and sys admin tasks.",1447556315

That&#x27;s one reason that IDE support for Java is amazing, but IDE support for JavaScript isn&#x27;t nearly as good - JavaScript allows and encourages <i>way</i> more freeform do-it-however runtime unverified stuff. Java locks everything down with a lot more &quot;must be compile time&quot; and static type system conventions.<p>You can permit the dynamic stuff as an alternative (as Java more or less does.) But if people actually use it, it screws up the tools&#x27; ability to introspect into your code.<p>As a result, less-dynamic formats like HTML and CSS get better tooling, as a rule, because the tools have an easier job to do. And highly-dynamic languages like JavaScript and Ruby have terrible tools support, because they make the tools&#x27; lives quite difficult because of their language and library design.",1447556256

I&#x27;ve seen powerful, BASIC-like 4GL&#x27;s whose operation were more clear than simple language doing equivalent things because they were designed for that. The ideal language gives you just enough features and power to let you productively express what you need without being too complex to understand.<p>The DSL languages are in a special category here. You start with powerful host languages such as LIPS/Racket or REBOL. The language is usually simple enough to understand plus has something like macros for extension. Each domain that we run into a lot and/or has plenty boilerplate can have a DSL that lets us concisely express those operations both for productivity and clarity. The underlying language is powerful and still comprehensible for times when the DSL&#x27;s aren&#x27;t enough.<p>So, the author is a bit off. What we need isn&#x27;t less powerful languages. It&#x27;s powerful languages maintaining clarity and avoiding the everything but the kitchen sink philosophy.<p>Note: HTML/CSS wasn&#x27;t the best choice to support author&#x27;s point. It was good for static pages. Yet, people needed more power. So, they added a crappy client-side language, all kinds of server frameworks, then all kinds of client frameworks, and so on and on. Languages like Curl and Opa handle the situation with a unified, powerful approach that was more clear than the web ecosystem in general. Also had less security and maintenance issues. So, author&#x27;s example works against them in practice.",1447556218

I must ask, what data do you have behind that statement.<p>I think both languages offer their own set of pros and cons.<p>For me, Go has been my go-to because of the maturity of the language. And, it has been implemented in systems that run at a very large scale by people within Google/YouTube as well as CloudFlare.<p>Would I consider it? Honestly, maybe one day. But that depends on how the language, and related things, mature over the next few years. And I think it&#x27;s after the libraries have filled-in, and there is experience running systems built with it at scale.<p>Go is allowing me to solve the problems I have right now with some well-built packages.

As an example, I&#x27;ve been assisting a small non-profit arts organization, constructing a database system to keep track of artists&#x27; work, etc.<p>In the past there was essentially no ordered data-keeping. For several years certain bits of info had been entered into a spreadsheet, like name, title of art work, date created, medium, email addresses and so on.<p>Data in that spreadsheet was a total mess.  Most fields were &quot;free-form&quot; text, with no consistency at all in format of dates, email, URLs, crucial fields left empty, data put in wrong fields, etc.  It was a lot of work to clean it up and quite clearly showed what motivates programmers to be &quot;controlling&quot;.<p>To be sure, excessive rigidity can be problematic, but it&#x27;s hard to make clear to users the importance of maintaining data integrity.  Frequently enough, users complain about constraints despite effort to demonstrate their necessity and benefits.<p>Of course constraints evolve, which is often the challenging component of creating and growing a system.  If there&#x27;s good reason to modify things, because what we conceived of as a number turns out otherwise, then we must indeed find a way to accommodate that reality.  OTOH if it really is a number and the user wants it different, we leave it as is and once again patiently try to show the user our reasons.<p>Finding the right balance between user &quot;freedom&quot; and necessary limitations on data input is hard to achieve.

I think it&#x27;s an awesome example of what can happen when you create a language with extensibility in mind.<p>-------------------<p>Scala solves this problem really well with typeclasses.<p>You can define a typeclass like<p><pre><code>    case class Refrigerated[T](thing: T) // this is just something holding things that have been refrigerated. \n    trait Refrigeratable[T] { // this is the typeclass\n      def refrigerate(thing: T): Refrigerated[T]\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow we have a refrigerated object that holds some object that&#x27;s been refrigerated, and it looks like I&#x27;m about to do some class composition, but I&#x27;m not. Bear with me.<p>Now, we have some sort of data class<p><pre><code>    case class Pillow(fluffiness: Int, warmness: Int)\n</code></pre>\nPretty straight forward, we now have a Pillow with measurable fluffiness and warmth<p>Next, lets implement refrigerated for pillow.<p><pre><code>    implicit val pillowRefrigerable: Refrigerable[Pillow] = new Refrigerable[Pillow] {\n      def refrigerate(pillow: Pillow): Refrigerated[T] = \n        Refrigerated(pillow.copy(warmness = pillow.warmness / 2))\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSo there&#x27;s an implementation of Refrigerable for pillow. Refrigerating a pillow just cuts the warmness in half.<p>So actually using the Refrigerable stuff. There&#x27;s two ways to go about this. One way is to just use the Refrigerable instance to refrigerate the pillow.<p><pre><code>    def refrigeratePillow(pillow: Pillow): Refrigerated[Pillow] = pillowRefrigerable.refrigerate(pillow)\n</code></pre>\nNothing special there. You could basically do that in any language. So how does scala do it better? Well, we can define a refrigerate method for anything Refrigerable like this:<p><pre><code>    def refrigerate[T](thing: T)(implicit refrigerableInstance: Refrigerable[T]): Refrigerated[T] = \n      refrigerableInstance.refrigerate(thing)\n</code></pre>\nNow this is really cool. Anything type that we have a Refrigerable instance for, can be used as an argument for refrigerate. And we don&#x27;t have to explicitly state what Refrigerable instance we&#x27;re using. Calling it looks like<p><pre><code>    val refrigeratedThing = refrigerate(anythingWithARefrigerableInstanceHere)\n</code></pre>\nOkay. We still haven&#x27;t gained a whole lot. All we&#x27;ve done so far, is make it so we don&#x27;t have to explicitly state what Refrigerable to use. So let&#x27;s go an extra step. Let&#x27;s make it so we just call refrigerate on the Object itself rather than passing the object as an argument to a method. This is possible, because scala let&#x27;s us make extension methods for generics.<p><pre><code>    implicit class RefrigerableOps[T](thing: T)(implicit refrigerableInstance: Refrigerable[T]) {\n      def refrigerate: Refrigerated[T] = refrigerableInstance.refrigerate(thing)\n    }\n</code></pre>\nOkay, now this is really cool. We&#x27;ve defined a method for any type for which we have Refrigerable in scope. This means we can now refrigerate our pillow more easily:<p><pre><code>    val refrigeratedPillow = myPillow.refrigerate\n</code></pre>\nWhat?! That&#x27;s great! And it gets better. Now that we&#x27;ve implemented this boilerplate, giving other things this wonderful syntax is easy. Let&#x27;s say I want to refrigerate my cousin, because she&#x27;s too hot.<p><pre><code>    case class Cousin(hotness: Int)\n    implicit val refrigerableCousin: Refrigerable[Cousin] = new Refrigerable[Cousin] {\n      def refrigerate(cousin: Cousin) = \n        Refrigerated(cousin.copy(hotness = cousin.hotness - 1))\n    }\n</code></pre>\nNow we can make our cousin less hot! Great!<p><pre><code>    val refrigeratedCousin = cousin.refrigerate\n\n</code></pre>\nThis is basically a good way to make things open to extension without subclassing it&#x27;s awesome!<p>You can even do more to simplify making the Refrigerable instances. You can effectively make them one liners.",1447554544

Though, I think an important addendum is that the selector relocation is context-global and thus the probabilistic mitigation cannot be thwarted by spacing the workload across threads.<p>----<p>(EDIT: Actually, I just reread it and in fact the event core will terminate a process after three successive &quot;segment not present&quot; faults, so that should be effective.)<p>----<p>By their testimony it is not any more susceptible to standard memory corruption errors than traditional monolithic OSes.

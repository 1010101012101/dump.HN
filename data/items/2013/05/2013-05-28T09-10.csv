I'd deployed the b2 blogging engine a couple of times before, and anything which made b2 easier to install/use/adapt was welcome. Amongst the (many) blog systems I'd tried up to then, b2 had the lowest technical barriers but was still an exercise in frustration to get installed and configured. In those early days of blog systems each product had its own quirks, and their own belief about what a blog was and how it should work. WordPress always tried to come across as ""the Writer's"" blogging system; once you had it setup to your preferences, it would stay out of the way. For the most part, anyway.<p>WordPress was never perfect, and it's still far from it, but you have to admire any system (particularly on the web) which is still going strong after 10 years, while remaining fairly close to it's original vision and principles. It made writing on the web more accessible to a generation of users, and for all its faults that should be celebrated.",1369735091

They have a strong synergy between their markets (content production and consumption, for instance), and their electronic products are still high quality, well designed pieces of consumer electronics, both on the engineering side as on the product design side.<p>They're a company that has tried weird, new kinds of devices, like head-mounted 3D displays, tablets and ultra-portables.

The first server has sensitive URLs, the second receives these in the referrer header.<p>In making the first connection, the client and first server get to make some security policy decisions: the crypto used in securing the connection, the availability of countermeasures against known TLS protocol vulnerabilities, client and server authentication methods, etc.  These parameters are complex, and you end up with a connection with some security level given some attacker model.  If you think about it really hard, you can come up with a quantitive estimate of what security you might get from the connection in terms of attacker work -- anywhere from zero (trivially broken) to 256-bit security (very good).<p>Assume our first connection has a 128-bit security level and has countermeasures for TLS vulnerabilities.  This is good going.  Now we serve over this connection a https link, which the user clicks.<p>Unfortunately the client and/or second server is poorly configured and we only manage (for the sake of argument) a 40-bit security level and no TLS vulnerability countermeasures.

When you crack passwords (either with rainbow tables or by brute force) you generate an iterator or use a dictionary and work through this generating hashes (with rainbow tables this works via a series (or chain) of what are called hash reduction functions instead of a plain iterator).<p>You then compare the hash you've generated against all the hashes being subjected to the crack. Where there's a match, you win!<p>If you're targeting a single hash and it's unsalted, rainbow tables will work as they're precomputed. It's inefficient, but it'll work.<p>If you're using a salt, rainbow tables need to be pre-computed for the salt - I actually did this years back with a team for oracle 10g SYS and other default user passwords as the username was used as the salt.<p>If you're targeting a single hash and it's salted then the iterative or dictionary approach will still work in roughly the same time as the salt is known. Separating the salt means you have to brute force it which is a PITA but generally because the way hashes tend to be stored (remember we're talking about a mechanism that shouldn't really be used anyway) the salt needs to be accessible by that system so you can dump the salt out regardless.<p>Depending on where my current research goes it looks like some salting mechanisms may be feasibly pre-computable now beyond those that use predictable salts. GPUs allow you to create and traverse enormous chains in rainbow tables and while having to precompute per salt will be a PITA it looks like it is possible with sufficient storage and GPU power.",1369731753

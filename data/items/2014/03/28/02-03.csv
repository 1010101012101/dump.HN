Unless you&#x27;re saying doctors are measuring things like dopamine activity or doing brain MRIs to diagnose ADHD.<p>There&#x27;s no good evidence that ADHD is not the result of psychological conditioning.  For that matter, even if you measured abnormal neurotransmitter activity or brain scans in suspected ADHD patients before diagnosing them, if you looked at animal psychology studies where pathological behavior has been induced by conditioning, I&#x27;d be surprised if there weren&#x27;t abnormal brain scans and neurotransmitter activity there, too.  The neurochemical/neurophysical measurements that might provide &quot;evidence&quot; of a non-psychological etiology are invalid if those physical aspects of the brain are themselves affected/modulated by neurological conditioning/development.<p>If your solution to any problematic &quot;neurobiological&quot; symptom that responds well to a certain drug is to prescribe that drug, because if it responds to a drug it must be a chemical/genetic problem, then <i>everyone</i> will be on a drug eventually.

Even the fake greenery and curb and gutter seams are still hard to pick out even when you know they&#x27;re there. And the lighting is excellent.<p>But the look -- aside from car styling -- isn&#x27;t a matter of charm and innocence. It&#x27;s a way of life that has been outlawed in America.<p>The mix of residential and commercial land use is illegal in almost all American communities, especially at the scale pictured. A few big cities still permit residential over commercial but whatever is left in most of America is grandfathered. If it&#x27;s taken down, you can&#x27;t rebuild it. In fact, my whole neighborhood is like that; if an earthquake hit, not one 1920s American railroad suburb bungalow on my block would meet zoning to be rebuilt.<p>Also, almost none of those commercial establishments has parking in front and surrounding it. The minimum requirements in almost all of America is about double as much space for parking as for all building interior space. Floor area ratios and landscape buffers usually require even more space around parking lots because they&#x27;re so ugly. Today, even the shots with parking wouldn&#x27;t have nearly  enough and almost all the commercial buildings would be illegal. I don&#x27;t see any of the residential buildings with the 2-3 independent parking spots usually required, either. Most of them -- for the sake of charm -- don&#x27;t have any off street parking. Also, driveways usually can&#x27;t abut the property line, so the garage has to dominate the front of the house, creating a snout house effect and eliminating the friendly front porches.<p>Part of the appeal of these scenes is evoking an America that has been outlawed in pursuit of faster roads and free parking. The grace and community of neighborhoods, the diversity of age and social class, and affordability have been part of the cost. Certainly this is not the first time reversing those mistakes has made a scene prettier.

When it is produced, your veins (I will use vein to reference both veins and arteries) expand. If you&#x27;ve ever exercised and seen your veins become larger, that is nitric oxide at work.<p>It also clears out the plaque &quot;pockets&quot; or &quot;cysts&quot; that form in your veins.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2050816/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2050816/</a><p>If those pockets break open (the very thin inner lining of the vein breaks) and the plaque content gets into your bloodstream, it causes a heart attack because that plaque liquid causes your blood to clot, essentially make a big scab ball in your vein that blood can&#x27;t get through, effectively depleting all the cells that rely on the blood from getting any oxygen or nutrients, killing the effected cells in minutes / hours if blood flow is not restored.<p>The problem with fat is that is really slows down nitric oxide production.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21903940"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21903940</a><p>Because to produce nitric oxide, your veins need a couple ingredients. Lets call them A, B, and C.<p>A + B + C = Nitric Oxide<p>A B and C fit together like a puzzle. Well, fat has a molecule, lets call it D. That can ALSO combine with A and B to produce something else.<p>So picture this:<p>AAAAAA   BBBBBBB     CCCCCCCCCC   DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD<p>If those can randomly form to their produce ABC, or ABD, looking at the quantities above, which are you more likely to have, ABC or ABD?<p>ABD... Which is not nitric oxide... Which is not what we want!<p>This is why eating too much fat is not good. It really harms your arteries because you can&#x27;t produce the stuff that&#x27;s needed to clean them out and help them expand properly.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;too much&quot; is a relative term. Considering in this age that 1 table spoon of olive oil is all the oil found in 50 olives... The fat quantities we evolved for are waaaaay too low for what is so readily available now. This is why the MAJORITY of people have atherosclerosis. That is the condition of plaque built up in your veins, which leads to heart attacks, strokes, and your dick not working.<p>P.S. vegetables increase nitric oxide production (because they contain the &quot;C&quot; molecule)<p>P.P.S. you should buy L-Arginine (the &quot;C&quot; molecule) from Amazon <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OVX3U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0013OVX3U&linkCode=as2&tag=k003f-20"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013OVX3U/ref=as_li_ss_tl?...</a> (affiliate link, I am thinking of selling it and this post is my MVP sales pitch).",1395975231

While not entirely independent, these CUDA cores have far deeper pipelines and far superior ALU&#x27;s to the one in the article.

Those psychiatrists who were “well informed” about investigations into the chemical imbalance theory of mental disorders knew it hadn’t really panned out, with such findings dating back to the late 1970s and early 1980s.

It&#x27;s a gratuitously bad idea to enable the prior restraint feature sitewide and by default. Besides the principle of prior restraint, that has all the hallmarks of being a feature that scales very poorly because it requires human involvement. Requiring human involvement and discretion is the point, so I&#x27;m not sure how one could eliminate that. Further, the part of it that say &quot;if a user has a comment in the pending-approval status, they may not post new comments at all,&quot; seems very, very likely to have adverse consequences of large scope. People participate in multiple discussions over time and change their minds about them and behave differently in different contexts in response to different prompts. Holding all of their participation hostage to something they&#x27;ve said in the most contentious available context, seems like a great way to exert a chilling effect on participation as a whole.<p>I strongly, strongly object to and oppose turning on the prior-restraint feature sitewide by default, and especially to the &quot;if a user has a comment in the pending-approval status, they may not post new comments at all&quot; part of the feature.<p>That said, the history of moderating large discussions, especially in digital media, demonstrates that giving moderators programmatic tools to enforce their judgment is a Good Thing. So if you consider the proposed feature as &quot;Allow moderators to say that any reply to a comment in the tree rooted at Comment Foo, must be human-approved before going live,&quot; sounds like a great tool for a moderator to have at their disposal. It is limited in scope and its effects can be judged and known.

The claim about h.265 encoded 720p video vs. h.264 encoded video is particularly egregious. From the article:<p>&quot;For example, a 720p movie transmitting in HEVC will only require 600 Kbps to crisply stream, a connection speed drastically lower than the current average of 4.5 Mbps.&quot;<p>Utter nonsense. The statement is phrased so it appears that they are comparing the same video quality, when in reality, the best h.265 encoders will probably only reduce 720p file size (for a given quality) by around 30% vs. x264 encoded h.264.<p>I do at least applaud the author for mentioning that hardware decoder support is a ways off, but the citations he offers for actual decoder support are very light on details. I seriously doubt we&#x27;ll see hardware h.265 decoding support in even half of newly marketed devices 2 years from now. Nevermind the heavily entrenched existing install base that Netflix will still be servicing. Software decoding h.265 will make a top of the line CPU scream right now.<p>And then there&#x27;s the problem that encoding h.265 takes about 40 times as long as h.264 which is hardly negligible but he just cursorily tosses off. His conclusion is what really annoys me though:<p>&quot;Despite these challenges, major ISPs working together with Netflix to adapt its massive library into a data-friendly format is a better long-term solution for every party involved.&quot;<p>Just how exactly will the US ISPs be involved here? Are they going to rent out a few thousand EC2 instances and re-encode all of that content? No. Are they going to donate substantial sums of money to x265 or any other effort to develop encoders? No. Are they going to provide R&D funds to Qualcomm, Intel, Nvidia, etc. to hasten the development of hardware decoders? Of course they won&#x27;t. They will do what they have always done: They will leverage the network duopoly they&#x27;ve been handed by the US Government. They will never make good on their commitment to build out a 45mbps/45mbps symmetrical network connection to every end user that US tax payers paid for, and they will rely on actual innovators to compensate for their lazy, unethical and greedy business model. The truth is that HEVC is not primarily intended to make 720p content cheaper to move about, it&#x27;s intended to make 4K and 8K content streaming possible given the wretched recalcitrance of US network providers.",1395973718

There should not be a scroll bar as long as the sign in link is shown.<p>Logged in UI:\nMargins seem off.\nNeeds filters, price range, location (look at sublet.com).\nShould show your own listings.\nMap view? (look at hotpads.com)\nFor a lot of rentals expect no pictures.\nIcons need tooltips.\nAbsolutely needs lessor and lessee ratings and need to solicit these aggressively, there are too many housing scams out there these days.<p>Appointment UI:\nDon&#x27;t like it. Use a standard calendar control IMO. (e.g <a href=""http://jqueryui.com/datepicker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jqueryui.com/datepicker</a>)<p>Appointment Workflow:\nWhen I click an &quot;attend an open house&quot; button I expect to see when the lessor has set up an open house, perhaps with an &quot;RSVP&quot; and &quot;request an appointment button&quot;. If the seller hasn&#x27;t set up an open house the main UI should say something like &quot;request an appointment&quot;. I assume that setting up an appointment fires off an email, but if it doesn&#x27;t it should.<p>Concept:\nInteresting, but crowded. Craigslist, hotpads, and sublet.com are all substantially sized competitors. You need to look at what they are doing and figure out how you are going to do it better, just focusing on a niche market isn&#x27;t enough but does allow you to better in ways that the larger market (and your larger competitors) don&#x27;t care about.<p>Business model:\nI don&#x27;t know about this one. Renters trash places, scammers double-rent the same apartments, and subletters get their crap thrown in the street when their &quot;landlord&quot; stops paying their rent and just pockets what you gave them... these are not situations you want to be in the middle of.  Also the expectation is that you are going to pay a small listing fee upfront instead of paying monthly... you are fighting inertia on that one. OTOH, I can see why no upfront cash would be attractive to college kids, though a lot of them will just do a deal between themselves and not pay you.<p>Also keep in mind that housing is regulated to varying degrees through the country.",1395972873

Not just because of your beliefs, which you have kept to yourself because they are so unjustifiable that you are ashamed to discuss them, but because of your ACTIONS, which tangibly contributed to the success of Proposition 8, thus destroying the existing gay marriages in California and preventing others. That was your intent, and that was the result of your actions, so you deserve credit for destroying those marriages, and you should be ashamed of yourself.<p>The Supreme Court finally ruled that Proposition 8 was wrong. Can you finally admit that YOU were wrong?<p>But I am sure you won&#x27;t, because as a religious bigot, you think you&#x27;re better than everyone else, and that you have a right to tell other people how to live their lives.<p>You&#x27;ve so much as proven that with your latest cowardly statement, a non-apology apology, which dances around the fact that you did what you did, that brought shame to the company that you direct, and blatantly avoids saying you&#x27;re sorry and that you&#x27;re wrong.<p>This is how your non-apology apology sounds:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocv5WdBmSok"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ocv5WdBmSok</a>",1395972845

Yes the person is more important than the language. I&#x27;d buy that.<p>I guess &quot;expression&quot; seems semi-obvious to me since it&#x27;s a standard rule in SBT. Variable assignments, return values and function bodies might get close.<p><pre><code>  val a = 1 + 1\n</code></pre>\nThat would be an expression. Instantiating a DTO with a dozen fields, using keyword arguments and newlines between for clarity would be a single expression to me.<p>An if/else with a simple switch for the return value would be an expression for example. A more complex else case might have nested expressions though.<p>It takes some charity I suppose; one of those &quot;I know it when I see it&quot; things. I don&#x27;t do a lot of Math based programming though. It&#x27;s all business rules, DTOs, serialization, etc. So maybe not something that could be formalized too easily.<p>I guess where I&#x27;d intuitively disagree (and would be interested in further reading) is that LOC as a measure just doesn&#x27;t feel like it works for me.<p>Considering only LOC to implement a task it&#x27;s likely: Java, Ruby and Scala in that order (from most to fewest). But in my personal experience bugs are probably more like: Ruby, Java, Scala from most to fewest.<p>Hopefully that helps clarify and not just muddy what I&#x27;m trying to express further.<p>What confuses me is that you appear to be claiming that fewer LOC should correlate strongly with fewer bugs, but then go on to say that terser is not automatically better (in this context (sic?)).

7484895,comment,7484106,7484520,4,0,MBCook,,,"I disagree with you, but I&#x27;m curious about this bit:<p>> I think of the three of them 1024 stands up the best. It takes the core ideas in Threes and sands them down into a game that is easier to grasp and plays faster, without becoming so simple (a la 2048) that it becomes a game a script can beat.<p>I&#x27;ve never played 1024. Could you explain how it &quot;sands [the ideas] down&quot; and and &quot;is easier to grasp&quot;? I found Threes simple to grasp, and it sounded to me from reading the essay that 1024 actually had <i>more</i> features. I would expect that would make it slower to learn.<p>> Mobile games need to be simple and streamlined<p>This is certainly true. I&#x27;ve found Threes did a pretty good job of this. My only complaint was the &#x27;signing&#x27; process at the end which was fixed with the first patch.<p>> I say all this to help others understand why I would point to this essay as an example of how not to respond to a problem like a barrage of cloners.<p>I didn&#x27;t see this post as a &quot;here&#x27;s why clones suck&quot; thing. I took it as a &quot;here&#x27;s what it was like for us to make our game&quot;. Only the prelude mentions the clones, the rest is just a development log. I&#x27;m glad they included that preamble, because I&#x27;ve been curious about their thoughts.<p>Basically, I didn&#x27;t see this as a message to customers but a &#x27;here&#x27;s what game development can be like&#x27; post.<p>> Customers don&#x27;t give you brownie points for how hard you worked on something. All they care about is how to get the best product for the best price.<p>Ah, but how they measure &quot;best&quot; matters. I <i>adore</i> Three&#x27;s presentation and I think the polish they put on it was well worth it. I see it as a sign of the amount of work they put into the whole product. I was happy to plunk down $3.<p>On the other hand 1024 and 2048 look like prototypes to me. Drawing a few colors of boxes and making them move around the screen isn&#x27;t hard. If 2048 was the only game to exist, they would have a higher barrier to get me to pay $3 as from screenshots (all you get in the app store) it doesn&#x27;t look like it&#x27;s worth it.<p>As a general note, it was clear a lot of thought and time went into Threes, but I&#x27;m amazed they had so many different visual designs and concepts along the way. There are at least 2-3x as many as I would have guessed.<p>I also kind of liked the argyle idea. That was rather neat.",1395972767

He kept calling me by my first name, once every two sentences, asking me if we could make a deal if only we could get past this tiny technical objection, and assuring me that his manager would be able to help. The manager was just as useless.<p>I used to do sales engineering. The most important long-term function of a pre-sales engineer is to know the field so well that they can recommend something that will work for the prospective client, even if that&#x27;s not something available from the engineer&#x27;s company. Trying to sell something that doesn&#x27;t work is a bad deal for everyone.",1395972101

If pending comments can be enabled per-thread, will there be a visual warning when commenting? I know mods will still have to approve the comment but that seems the lesser of the two benefits to me. If not then pending comments need to be enabled for the majority of threads to make everybody operation under the assumption that they are enabled.",1395972101

Always happy to see deep learning made more accessible and open!",1395972078

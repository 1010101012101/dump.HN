Is the increased productivity/good will you will get by allowing developers to pick worth more then enforcing a heterogeneous environment and loosing some productivity.<p>There are nearly always ways to work around compatibility differences. Sure you need word to talk to banks/accountants but most developers will be more then happy to work within a wiki. They have no need for Office (although sometimes Excel is worth having as a developer but open office will suffice for that)<p>The cost of finding these alternative routes is minimal especially if you find good developers who will no doubt have experience in this sort of thing. In fact you might create a more nimble work space if developers are used to accommodating others and are more open to change.<p>Good luck and be sure to let us all know how it goes :)",1258199021

It's more than not hurting to know them.  Although you may not ever use the knowledge directly, knowing these things affects your thinking in a myriad of subtle ways.<p>My degrees in mathematics appear pretty much useless on the surface, and rarely if ever get used directly.  But when I think about business, algorithms, implementation, planning, etc., I find myself explaining things with words in my head such as ""the topology"" or ""the metric"" or ""continuous"" or ""min-max"".  I then usually have to expand these to explain what I mean, and I've found yet again that the landscape in my head, put there by my studies, is helping me think things through in a way that others find difficult.<p>You won't need your degree, but studying this stuff (if it's a good school and you study it ""properly"") will have long-term intangible benefits.<p>The question is whether they will out-weigh the additional direct experience of working, not studying.  Without knowing you I can't say, but I would tend towards learning this stuff.",1258197008

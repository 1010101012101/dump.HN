It's a good read.",1173728556
3767,comment,3761,3761,0,0,notabel,,,"O'Reilly clearly gets to a point that I tried to make in reference to one of the first round of articles about freebase: namely, that by adopting the ideas of web2.0, namely relying on users to generate information because it is natural and convenient for them, we have a chance to take another shot at the semantic web, and perhaps actually make it past arguing in the W3C this time.",1173728349
3766,comment,3670,3670,0,0,Readmore,,,"It is true that making your users pay to try your product is the best way to keep your userbase small. I think that offering a free version and then a pay version with extra features is the only real way to expect users to pay. The problem is what happens when someone else comes along and offers all of your features for free? Google was really smart with Gmail because they started out offering people 2 gig of space, which seemed insane. What was even better is that they then made it constantly 'increase' so it seems like you have as much space as you'll ever need. But if you actually watch that ticker it's increasing so slowly that it probably isn't costing them any more money, and in fact their cost probably goes down, to give each user that much space.I guess my point is that once you have a user offering them a better 'precieved' value, even if it's not better than someone else, will get them to stick with you, or get them to consider a pay account.",1173728216

3764,comment,3727,3727,0,0,PindaxDotCom,,,"I also disagree with several of the minor premises in this article. Such as his statement that ""So what advantage does a 60-year-old .NET programmer have over a 27-year-old .NET programmer when they both have, at most, 5 years of experience doing .NET programming? Absolutely none."" ... That 60-year-old programmer has more experience and wisdom and that is a huge advantage over a newb!<p>Overall the author is making a good point. Technology workers have (or are beginning) to wake up to the fact that their skills are commoditizable. Anyone (anywhere) can be trained up to do their job. This is why most tech people get caught in the trap of the never ending skill upgrade cycle ... ""If I could just learn and get a certificate in X I can earn the big bucks..."". When what they really need to start thinking is how to apply the knowledge that they have into real solutions that they can then monetize.

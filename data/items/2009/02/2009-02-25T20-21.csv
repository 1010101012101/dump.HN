If someone doesn't deliver, someone else steps up and we move on.<p>In mature organizations, everyone is not running to the copier, and people begin to take notice of the terrain.  Politics, unpredictability, and general people challenges are perceived as a drag on the system.  As a defense mechanism, especially if incentives are involved, milestones are defined not for the common good, but to route around points of potential failure.<p>Milestones make it really easy for the offense to blame special teams and the defense to blame the coach after the team lost, even though they all celebrated success at different times during the game.<p>I agree, progress and outcome is what counts.

Here are my thoughts on the matter, as neatly as they can be summarized in a 1-minute forum posting:<p>1) We should allow & encourage more immigration of high-IQ, educated people.  Said IQ would be determined by using IQ tests on individuals, not by racial/country of origin quotas. Exceptions would be made for people with outstanding achievement in some field - we shouldn't exclude a world-class dancer because he has an average IQ, for example, or a great programmer because he doesn't have a college degree.<p>2) We should discourage immigration by low-IQ people, regardless of how hard they are willing to work.    Everyone would be assumed to be in the ""low-IQ, uneducated"" group until he has proven otherwise.<p>Do you disagree with either of these points?",1235594957

It makes some things easier, but other things are about the same.<p>I think a GUI app would be easier in, say, Haskell, than Java, for a number of reasons.  The lack of global state will make threading easy, which keeps the GUI responsive.  Abstractions like functional reactive programming will make the app's implementation cleaner.  Finally, if you do it right, most of your app won't depend on the GUI, and will be very easy to test.  (You can do that last one in any language, of course.)<p>Assuming your application does something useful, implementing the algorithmically complex part will be simpler as well.<p>Anyway, you can't understand the advantages of functional programming from reading some comments on a social news site.  You actually need to try writing the application -- then you can see exactly what the benefits are, and whether or not <i>you</i> care about them.  If you don't want to invest any effort in learning, well, that's another issue entirely.  (And is really the reason why many people don't all switch to Haskell.

494914,comment,494341,494686,0,0,ardit33,,,"European and Asians don't teach by the lowest denominator!!<p>Not everybody is born with the same abilities to learn.  Sure, you can teach people, but the slowest kids will take longer to learn. If you teach by the lowest denominator, you slow down the smart kids, the ones that will make great impacts in the economy in the future.<p>I am south-east european. Back at home everybody starts at the same footing.  Same books, same education.  By 5th grade, while people are still taught the same curricular, the brightests kids are bunched together in classes.  Assuming there are 200 kid in a grade, they are divided in classrooms  of 30-35 (teachers come to class, and students stay in the same class with the same peers), usually named A,B,C,D ...etc, witch a main teacher responsible for each class.   Example MySchool 5th A, gives a you the exact placement of a student.<p>Why it is unofficial  (not writen in policy) by the 5th the best students are usually placed in the A, B, classes, the average ones in the C and D classes, and the ones that are there just for a formal education in the rest of the classes.   There is some diversity introduced also,  (for those'd kids that try hard, (and whose parents care) they are still placed in higher level classes.<p>It is the same curricula, same books, maybe same teachers, but the evnviroment is different.  In the higher level classes students face more competition  (as there are lots of smart people), are challenged more to learn etc.<p>The system is setup in a way that it is easier to get a 5  (the lowest passing grade), but it is really hard to get a 10 (the highest grade).<p>Therefore, while you teach everything you can, the smart people are not artificially left behind by being taught by the lowest common denominator.<p>Also, a huge difference is that all sciences are taught,  By force.  You can't choose between physics or biology or chemistry,  you are forced to learn them all.  (biology is introduced in 6th grade, and chemistry in 8).  
The thought is that you have to try everything and have a taste of all sciences (and know the basics), so you know what you like to do in the future (in college)
The only thing you get to choose as optional is the SECOND foreign language you want to learn.<p>When I came in the States, i finished my last year of high-school on a average american high-school, and I could run circles around most american students.  Even in AP classes!<p>Amazing on how even a poor country like mine (Albania) can do some much better in basic education.   
I remember between 92-93  I had to learn in a cold class with no glasses on the windows, during winter, and we had to put paper on them, and all try to bunch up as much as possible together, around the wooden stove.<p>Amazing, yet there were so many bright students produced by that school.  1. Teachers cared. 2. Parents cared a lot more (education = future in their yes).  3. Curricula was heavy on science, and taught as much as it could on students and not on the lowest common denominator.",1235594563

Where were your contributions to the library, your documentation patches, your discussions of better ways to implement things? Have you been in the IRC channel, daily, helping people troubleshoot problems? Have you posted frequently on the mailing list in response to questions? If you're so dependent on Capistrano, where have you been? If your silence was because it all ""just worked"", then why are you so disgusted now? It all still ""just works"".<p>As for the ""Hey, anyone interested"" blog post: I've tried that before, on other projects. People don't respond to those. No one volunteers to be hit on the head with hammer repeatedly for no other compensation than a few slaps on the back. You have to really, really, REALLY want to do it, and a blog post is a bad way to ask for passion. Passion is discovered when you realize you need something, and it's not there (or not ENOUGH there). By dropping out, I've created an environment where people have to really examine their use of Capistrano and decide how passionate they are about it. Passionate enough to pick up where I left off? We'll see.<p>My decision was the right one. I stand by it. There has already been a post on the mailing list by a couple of programmers who have the credentials and the passion, and are willing to carry the torch. Maybe they would have responded to a blog post. Maybe not. But they've responded now, and now the community can either support them, or look elsewhere.

It doesn't sound like that's the case here.<p>Keep in mind  that most software isn't actually done when you deliver on the initial specs.  Companies will usually expect you to be available for some sort of maintenance phase where bugs fixes and small feature additions are done by you. They'll likely expect you to work at your original rate unless otherwise specified.  Even though you think it's only going to be 200 hours I suspect you will likely be involved with them longer than that.<p>What I would do is finish the contract, but start to set the company's expectations now so there are no surprises at the end.  Tell them honestly that you set your rate lower than your costs, and that after you deliver the project you will need to charge $35/hr or whatever the going rate is for further work.<p>On a side note, while $35 sounds like a great full-time wage when freelancing you'll be lucky if you can get 8 billable hours a day.  Sure, while deep in code it's easy to meet that, but there's the downtime between projects that you have to account for. Also as a freelancer you're expected to be an expert, so learning everything on the job is normally frowned upon -- you don't get paid when you take time off to learn how to use a new tool or technique.<p>I once heard the rule of thumb is that if you'd like to earn the same as you would working full time, but as a freelancer, that your hourly rate should at least be twice your full time wage.  Depending on where you live $35 might be good, but I don't know any experienced freelance developers in North America who charge that.",1235592694

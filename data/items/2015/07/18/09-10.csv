Unfortunately, due to the complexity of writing a mail client, I doubt I&#x27;ll finish in a week.<p>That said, thinking about the problem a bit more since last night, there&#x27;s 1 major performance bottleneck in the IMAP protocol for this particular use-case but it could be solved with an extension to SORT.<p>So, as I&#x27;m sure you know, the SORT command (even with ESORT) only allows returning MIN, MAX, MODSEQ, and COUNT (from memory there might be 1 more, but I forget what it is) in addition to the matching UIDs/indexes. It&#x27;s not that these aren&#x27;t useful, but to optimize the &quot;open a mailbox for the first time and display a message list to the user in the fastest way possible&quot;, they aren&#x27;t all that helpful. Instead, what is needed is something more akin to the following (made up) command:<p>TAG001 UID SORT RETURN (OFFSET 0 LIMIT 50 FETCH (ENVELOPE FLAGS ...)) UTF-8 REVERSE DATE ALL<p>And this command could return untagged FETCH responses with the requested info - since we&#x27;d need a way to determine order, we could say that the FETCH results should be in the order requested <i>or</i> we could also have it return an untagged ESEARCH response like extended SORT commands do now to define the UID ordering.<p>In other words, make it so that SORT (and SEARCH, for that matter) return the information that we ultimately care about rather than the list of UIDs which we then would have to use to fetch the information we want.<p>(in hindsight, this is probably what you meant by &quot;chatty&quot; whereas I interpreted it to mean &quot;verbosity&quot; last night)<p>Basically, make it a bit more SQL-like.<p>Problem solved.",1437213592

Or maybe your company is doing a poor job of making it clear what it is that he brings to the table.<p>No matter how expertly this is pulled of, human jealousy is still a risk. In particular, because there are more than a few people who think what other people do is less valuable just because it isn&#x27;t what <i>they</i> do. In addition, I don&#x27;t think many companies can successfully justify every decision in a satisfactory way to every employee, no matter what decisions they make.

9907111,comment,9902244,9906184,0,0,berkut,,,"Per iteration, bi-directional is extra work too. Obviously these integration methods are much better at finding certain hard-to-find light paths/sources, but my point is that in VFX, it&#x27;s generally good enough to fake stuff by just turning shadow/transmission (depending on renderer) visibility off for certain objects to allow light through.<p>It&#x27;s rare that we actually have glass/metal objects with lights in/around them such that bi-directional / VCM actually makes sense - even for stuff like eye caustics we&#x27;ve found that uni-directional does a pretty good job. And other situations like car headlights behind glass with metal reflectors behind the light, just turn transmission visibility off for the glass part, and yes, it&#x27;s not fully-accurate (in terms of refraction and light leak lines), but we&#x27;re generally using IES profiles for stuff like this so we get accurate light spread patterns anyway.<p>Well, they do in that camera rays generally (and light rays in bi-directional/VCM) end up using the higher mipmap levels of textures, so you&#x27;re reading a lot more data for these samples, hence pushing stuff out of cache much more: we&#x27;ve seen this with PRMan 19/20 in RIS: using incremental can have a 3x slowdown in some cases compared to non-incremental, as the camera rays are much more coherent per-bucket in non-incremental, so the highest level mipmaps are kept in cache much more. With incremental, you&#x27;re only sending the bucket size number of samples and equivalent texture reads for the camera rays, with secondary bounces generally using much smaller/lower mipmap tiles for the texture request (and you can get away with box filtering these in 95% of the cases), then moving on to the next bucket, which will probably need completely different high-level mipmap tiles for its camera rays. With texture IO often being the bottleneck in VFX rendering, this is a huge issue.<p>Nope, still in London for a bit, then off to NZ...",1437213227

It&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a huge risk to F-16 pilots zooming over guys with rusty AK-47s at 10,000 ft.  From what I can glean the US has lost two strike aircraft (an F-15 and an F-16) in Afghanistan since 2001, neither of them to hostile action.<p>If there&#x27;s any difference politically it likely arises from the fact that you typically use at least a 250 lb bomb in a manned strike, whereas drone attacks normally involve missiles with 20 lb warheads, which you can use to blow up, say, a single car without taking out the entire block.",1437211072

When it comes down to an individual making a decision against two people, this will <i>always</i> come into play, subconsciously or not. You have to be incredibly naive to believe that you&#x27;ll still get favored for bonuses if everyone hates you, no matter how good your performance is. This is why being likeable/liked <i>is part of</i> good performance.<p>If we&#x27;re talking aggregate bonuses, may not apply, but anytime it&#x27;s a 1v1 thing, yes, of course the amount the manager likes you is going to matter, even if it can&#x27;t swing the decision in your favor in that particular instance.",1437210803

Classifying them as &quot;not conscious&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be useful at anything besides making them stop arguing with you. At that point, &quot;conscious&quot; is just a word for people who meet some minimum intelligence and happen to also call themselves &quot;conscious&quot;. We might as well use any other word.<p>I don&#x27;t think the word &quot;conscious&quot; has enough of an agreed-upon definition for this question to be even as productive as the classic question-that&#x27;s-really-about-definitions &quot;does a tree falling with no one around make a noise?&quot;. I think the question &quot;is X conscious&quot; is mixing many different questions together. Does the US have a subjective experience? (Who knows. I think we only assume other humans even do because we realize we&#x27;re probably not the one special person to have one, but it&#x27;s hard to generalize that solution to things very physically different than ourselves.) Does the US think like us? (It clearly takes a stupidly long time to come to any decisions and then changes its mind every 4 or so years on certain things.)<p>Just for fun as a little tangent, here&#x27;s an absurd example possibly closer to the US: imagine you have a person that acts just the same as any other, except somehow their neurons in addition to carrying simple signals each have human intelligence and awareness and rich inner lives that they mostly keep private, but when you ask the person if they&#x27;re conscious, their neurons stir from their own thoughts at hearing a familiar word and break protocol by answering individually instead of following their proper neural behaviors to allow the person to answer the question themselves. (If that seems a little too disconnected from reality to even picture, then it might help to imagine a natural born human who undergoes a surgical process involving nano-machines that replaces their original neurons with the described self-aware neurons one at a time.)",1437210085

This is the code I do development on.<p>2) I release a copy of this software under an open source license that people can use for whatever they want. This copy is what is currently available on GitHub<p>3) This open source copy of the software is used in Insight Maker which is run by Give Team.<p>The key point of this setup is that the code for Insight Maker is open source and anyone can use it. But my copy of the code isn&#x27;t bound by the open source license and I can release copies of it under other licenses in the future if I need to (e.g. if I had a consulting arrangement I could provide the client with a copy of Insight Maker that they didn&#x27;t need to publish changes to, which the open-source license requires).<p>Here is a cool one:<p><a href=""https://insightmaker.com/insight/1954"" rel=""nofollow"">https://insightmaker.com/insight/1954</a><p>The World3 model is a detailed simulation of human population growth from 1900 into the future.

Does increasing the amount of non-renewable resources (which could occur through the development of better exploration technologies) improve our future? Also, experiment with the start date of a low birth-rate, environmentally focused policy.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World3</a>",1414322017

Of course, the &quot;full promise&quot; is queries that have the ability to draw inferences from indirect relationships in the data - admittedly the few examples I&#x27;ve seen, whilst remarkable - perform best when there&#x27;s only one, homogeneous underlying dataset. Where you have disparate datasets from many organizations/institutions (and the data spans decades), these things struggle outside of demos due to the huge work required in normalizing/mapping onto something common that can be sensibly queried against: and sometimes that&#x27;s even when the same ontologies are in use! The underlying data just doesn&#x27;t necessarily map very well into the sem-web representations, so duplicates occur and possible values explode in their number of valid permutations even though they all mean the same handful of things. And it&#x27;s the read-only semantic-web, so you can&#x27;t just clean it, you have to map it..<p>Which is why I&#x27;m always amazed that <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/</a> works at all.

I remember being excited about <a href=""http://openrefine.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openrefine.org/</a> for &quot;liberating&quot; messy data into clean linked data... but it turns out that you really don&#x27;t want to curate your information &quot;in the graph&quot;; it seems obvious, but traditional relational datasets are infinitely more manageable than arbitrarily connected nodes in a graph.<p>So, most CMS platforms are doing somewhat useful things in marking up their content in machine-readable ways (RDFa, schema.org [as evil as that debacle was], HTTP content-type negotiation and so on) either out-of-the-box or with trivially installed plugins.<p>If you look around, most publishing flows are extremely rich in metadata. For all sorts of things, like describing news articles [1], journal articles [2] (DOIs weren&#x27;t built to serve the semantic web, but certainly are rich in metadata), movie/book/audio titles and their content...<p>Beyond that, we just had GovHack [3] here in Australia a few months ago where groups were encouraged to do what they could with public government datasets (which themselves, again, aren&#x27;t necessarily &quot;semantic web&quot; but are increasingly using &quot;linked-data&quot; formats/standards for, if not interoperability, then at least dataset discovery). There are RDF representations of everything from parliamentary archives [4] to land use [5].<p>I&#x27;ve personally seen some great applications of inter-organizational data mashing/sharing/discovery in materials science and a few years ago I really enjoyed working with bioinformatics services such as [6] which allows some fun SPARQL queries to answer interesting questions.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.ap.org/ap-metadata-services"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.ap.org/ap-metadata-services</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.opendoar.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opendoar.org/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.govhack.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govhack.org/</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/vufind/Record/46420/Export?style=RDF"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/vufind/Record/46420/Export?...</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/ca83e9bf-1220-43b6-b332-206bf0daa258.rdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.data.gov.au/dataset/ca83e9bf-1220-43b6-b332-206bf...</a>\n[6] <a href=""http://biodiversity.org.au/confluence/display/nsl/services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://biodiversity.org.au/confluence/display/nsl/services</a>",1414321319

This has only gotten worse now, from what I hear.<p>Largely because these companies pay less, not because quality of work in product companies is higher.<p>I worked at a onsite location for a company which is one of the largest internet companies. We were all hired to work there after elaborate interviews. And we used to be repeatedly told they hire only the best, from the best universities and all that. Yet when we worked together as a team, most of these kids hired from IIT&#x27;s who really believed they were some special snow flakes and all they really got to work on was HTML and some small time shell scripts. These kids had never seen what it meant work on a P1 bug after clocking full nighter, never had any exposure command line kung fu, they didn&#x27;t know what it meant to having spend a full weekend writing a 2K line perl script because someone at the top wanted a prototype/reporting application done by Monday, heck for all the algorithm geniuses they were considered they could barely do any genuine work of significance to the real world. All they were really interested is in learning the next set of interview questions that were in trend so they could get some one in their alumni have an interview arranged for their next jobs.<p>The irony is we did bulk of the really algorithmic work there was. We set up a good deal of hadoop infrastructure and platform, we wrote a great deal of what were the complex workflows. And got a lot of systems and applications set up. Yet we were thought of as some kind of lesser children.<p>I&#x27;d really judge the best students/best professionals by the work they do, not the college they belong to, or their degree or their college network.<p>Show me what work you&#x27;ve done.

The same sort of thing as any local government regulation. Just because it doesn&#x27;t appear to be a more or less independant part of the government doesn&#x27;t make it&#x27;s rules any less of a law.

So here is my &quot;15 years of experience and no data points&quot; commentary<p>Indian Outsourcing has a history that made it the way it is today - and it has nothing whatsoever to do with the quality or skill level of (averaged) developers.  The article smacks horribly of what I call &quot;loud old white manager of forty Indians&quot; syndrome.<p>India in the 60s and 70s tried to cut itself off from the outside world and political strategy effectively strangled any native IT industry in it&#x27;s crib. So Indian hackers did what hackers all over do - got round the problem, either by emigrating or by flying out to find clients.  Outsourcing was for a while quite literally the only game in town for IT.<p>It worked really well - and therein lies the rub. If you want to maintain a good client relationship with a Fortune 500 company mostly you do it at the middle manager level.<p>Fast forward to 2014 - Now it is clear that software is eating the world, senior managers are going to replace middle managers with some combination of simplified process, automated decision making and &quot;empowering&quot; frontline workers.  And yet those middle managers are the ones outsourcers have spent decades learning to work with.<p>This has left a mark on the Indian university system - with a lack of professors (remember the good ones left) the schooling was left to commercial companies - and it is only slowly recovering from this bias - &quot;don&#x27;t challenge the loud old white guy&quot; and &quot;learn Java&quot; are two axioms that (good) universities would not teach but outsourcers have built in.<p>So there is innovation and hacker culture in India.  But it is not as celebrated as &quot;going to work, having a proper job and working for a named Fortune 500 company&quot;.  Every hackers mother prefers the second one, and India has an unusual situation that the majority of IT education prefers it too.<p>Apart from this quirk of history Indian outsourcing and project management is down the line the same as every where else - gosh! Training at the expense of the client ! Rapid turnover on internal projects! Badly spec&#x27;d out projects with minimal business justification turn out badly!<p>This is not an Indian problem.

This mini computer has been by our side since the beginning. We are emotionally deeply attached to it and it played a major role in building up our business. So this year we thought that we would like to contribute in two ways.<p>1- Over the years many Raspberry Pi fans expressed their enthusiasm for our project of providing an affordable smart home platform, so we decided to prepare a special christmas present - just for them. So if you own a Pi and a few Z-wave devices you will be able to use the FlatCloud.
2 - We will donate a certain amount of money to the Raspberry Pi foundation to support their cause.<p>Control lights, sensors / actuators, any home appliance - monitor energy - set up your rooms and most importantly the Actions will allow your devices to speak with each other.
Merry Christmas everyone!",1419520992

Many problems he mentions aren&#x27;t specific to India, you&#x27;ll find them across all developing economies (We had most of the same issues contracting work to a Chinese and Brazilian company).<p>At the end of the day, you get what you pay for. And some companies are clearly okay with said cheap work. There&#x27;s a reason the IT industry in Hyderabad/B&#x27;lore is booming. Want solid contracting work without slackers? Sure, you can still find plenty of those too in India (thoughtworks?) but pay up (albeit less than what you may have to in the valley). The reason you&#x27;re outsourcing core-work/parts of it to India should be that you can&#x27;t find enough talent locally; not for getting it done cheaply or because your in-house developers think the work is &#x27;beneath&#x27; them (I&#x27;ve seen this happen way often, dev with inflated ego doesn&#x27;t want to test. Wants to do a cold hand-off and expects the cheap developers to be on his level and take dirty work off his hands. Starts cursing). So, there&#x27;s probably room for both (cheap and expensive) industries in India. Unfortunately, you might have to expend more effort before you find the company that fits your needs.<p>Articles like these insinuate nothing but Xenophobia and racism. More often than not, Indians are always on the receiving end of it despite contributing so much to the software industry in general.

So vim, Emacs, SourceInsight, SlickEdit and others are much more popular than VS.<p>Top level directories represent depots (think: repositories) of the SourceDepot version control system (home grown Perforce fork). Directory levels also tend to represent branches, so e.g. WINMAIN has branches for most depots (e.g. FBL_minio, FBL_minkernel, etc.) with additional subbranches following this pattern (e.g. FBL_minkernel_devices).<p>I liked Windows build system a lot.

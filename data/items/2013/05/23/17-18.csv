5758335,comment,5758046,5758046,2,0,jfaucett,,,"To put it bluntly from my perspective, testing js is pretty much hell. Don't get me wrong, it does depend on the context though. For example, if I'm building a jQuery plugin or my own pure js libraries then qunit is in my opinion the best solution and it does a great job - I'd recommend it :).<p>But once you start to have to test large applications where the server side app and javascript are intertwined, you start running into lots of problems. I'm just guessing but I think this is the case for most devs that really want to test their javascript. Most arent building a library they're using one, they're also probably not building one page apps that are pure javascript, more like components that are getting integrated into larger (existing) applications. And personally, I haven't been able to find a solution that works well without tons of annoying headaches, that are often more trouble than clicking through your app in various browsers and os's for a day. So if anyone has found a solution i would love to hear about it PLEASE! :)<p>Right now you can try selenium (I personally don't like it, but wont go into it here), then you can also try something like phantomjs (or another headless browser), but this wont let you test IE at all, which usually defeats almost the whole point. Also you're most likely going to run into problems dealing with context, because your javascript is being inserted into the testing browser inside the test suite context (long story but I've had problems here too). Capybara has problems with testing async js, but you could try it. In summary its just a pain, I wish someone had a solution too but I unfortunately dont.",1369331993

Once you understand the basic technique it's easier to figure out your own organizational structure. My main suggestion is to discard the seed project's suggestions of organizing things into directories like /controllers, etc., in favor of organizing the files around specific screens.

Sure there are a million use cases some of them better than others, but that is because they give you near total freedom to use Evernote and structure things however you want.  Underneath it all the only real features are notebooks, notes, tags, and a powerful index.  Admittedly this ability to do anything is kind of hard to market, because you have to be somewhat of a power user to structure things efficiently.  If they built an app that was singularly amazing at storing files and photos for reference I think that would somewhat go against their ethos, and if you chose to use different specialized apps for all the use cases, it would naturally come at the expense of fragmentation.",1369331647

5758275,comment,5756911,5756911,21,0,cletus,,,"I too have built a reasonably sized Angular app in the last year [1] and echo a lot of these thoughts. I'll add a few of mine:<p>1. For CSS, honestly for any project it'd be hard for me not to simply use Bootstrap and be done with it and then do the minimum CSS possible (I say this as someone who has been doing CSS for years). Bootstrap really is the de facto CSS for the modern Web;<p>2. Organization: I agree the angular-seed project (which I started with and still use) isn't suited to organizing large projects and I agree separating into functional modules is the way to go;<p>3. Directives are awesome but to get all the two way data binding working requires a fairly deep understanding of how they work (to get the correct combination of scopes, transclusion, etc);<p>4. Directives also have limits that are sometimes annoying. You still can't generate definition list items with an ng-repeat, for example (a template has to have one top-level element). A solution to this is coming;<p>5. There's no good way of both just including code and using the parent scope plus some extras. This is done for reasons of code separation but there really is a use case (IMHO) for includes vs imports for templates;<p>6. $resource has no HTTP PUT method;<p>7. I'd probably avoid $resource altogether although it looks attractive. Use rich objects [2] instead;<p>8. Angular allows you to use a bunch of different other frameworks but it doesn't always play completely nice with them. Take the popover in Bootstrap. The way this works is by moving an element around in the DOM. This doesn't lend itself to a ""nice"" Angular directive (my version at least is kind of a hack).<p>9. Underscore.js is awesome. Use it;<p>10. Try to limit yourself to using jqLite that Angular comes with rather than full jQuery. This isn't really possibly with any reasonable part of Bootstrap however;<p>11. Isolate scopes in directives results some weird and unexpected behaviour. For example, if you reference something with an attribute, it'll work if it's an object (including an array) but won't with a simple value, requiring you to put such values in objects just so the directive can get a reference to it. This tripped me up a few times;<p>12. Scopes aren't always truly isolated either. For example, you can get tripped up by this if you have two attribute directives on the same element.<p>[1]: for those who follow IO, I am the Tech Lead of the Open Bidder project at Google (<a href=""http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/05/announcing-open-bidder-beta-platform.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleadsdeveloper.blogspot.com/2013/05/announcing-op...</a>)<p>[2]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/11850027/18393"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/a/11850027/18393</a>",1369331602

5758269,comment,5756142,5757093,3,0,microarchitect,,,"I think your opinion is at least a decade old. Research-wise Indian institutions are moderately productive now and especially so if you count the research budgets they have to work with. There is a challenge in finding high-quality graduate students because of course the likes of MIT and Stanford have a lot more to  offer. But this is no different from, say, the best undergrads at UMass going to MIT. My point is there are good students and good work does happen.<p>Part of the reason why the best students used to go abroad was because there were a lot more job opportunities in the US after a graduate degree. This is changing now with MSR India, Intel Research India, GE Research, TCS Research and so on becoming well-established labs in their own right. The job scenario for academic jobs in India is <i>way</i> better than it is in the US and a moderately competent candidate can easily get jobs now at an IIT/IISER/ISI.<p>As someone who is keenly following higher education in India, I think the state of higher education is better than ever and rapidly improving. An easy way of judging this is to look at where our students are ending up. The best undergrads in India today invariably end up at the best schools in the world. This wasn't true 30 years and there are many examples of really high quality IIT graduates who studied in mid-tier US schools. Even students from second-tier schools like, say CEG Guindy or NIT Surathkul, now end up at very very good universities. The situation is less good in the humanities and social sciences, which btw are struggling the world over, but some  of the newer IITs have social science and humanities departments and some progress is being made [1].<p>[1] <a href=""http://nanopolitan.blogspot.com/2013/01/sukhdeo-thorat-on-social-science-in.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nanopolitan.blogspot.com/2013/01/sukhdeo-thorat-on-so...</a>",1369331564

I don't know where to find my customers in the first place to get them to rent my product, let alone ask them questions regarding the development of it.<p>Then there's the market research aspect of what I'm doing. I know there's a market for VPS Instances, which is what I rent. But I haven't done any specific research for the specific niche I'm targeting, which is the financial sector who needs low latency access to New York City's financial district. I just know there are people who will find value in that my servers are colocated in a data center close-by to Wall Street, so I make that a selling point.<p>I know I want to eventually target big data customers when I ever get the opportunity to reinvest revenue & buy additional servers that I can build a cluster large enough to handle big data workloads, but I don't know if there are big data customers in the financial sector, I guess there ought to be, and it's a specialized enough market that if there is I could be a monopoly in the field. Maybe, I haven't done the research to find out. I don't know where to begin to do so.<p>It's not like I don't want to know, I just don't have the budget or the contacts to find out. For christ's sake my daily Google AdWords budget is less than $2. I don't even know if that's going to work at all.<p>I'm totally self- funded, so there's been no real need to show anyone a business plan, and as such I haven't bothered to write one. I'm not too good at writing projects, I stick to building servers which I can do.<p>I might need to seek outside funding, even as small as I am- I only have 1 server- albeit a real fast one, just to be able to manage a marketing plan to find customers that will fund expansion beyond server #1, and to finance operations expenses like colo fees.

The only thing it lacks is DOM wide selectors, but again, if you're writing a directive, you're passed the element, and you can do selectors on that element and it's children, which is all you should need -- otherwise, it seems the abstraction has started to leak, and requires re-consideration for your design.<p>I don't use any jQuery transitions / animations.

Looks are a <i>part</i> of it, but their reasoning is all historical. Unlike say, segregation in the 60s USA -- black < white simply because they're black.

5758139,comment,5756142,5756724,3,0,microarchitect,,,"<i>transferred back to Indian universities by returnees who start academic careers?</i><p>Of course, they are. I went to a top-tier school in India for my masters degree and I'm now a graduate student at a well-known private university in the US. I would say there is very little difference in the quality of teaching between my Indian alma mater and my current university. The main advantage here seems to be an army of teaching assistants conducting office hours,  ""precepts"" and such which probably help struggling students. But I think the in-class lectures, homework assignments and exams are of the same quality.<p>I also went to a second-tier private school for my undergraduate degree and that is where I experienced the sort of teaching the article talks about. I think, like most of India's other problems, it boils down to economics. I paid about about $1200 in total for my four year undergraduate degree. I believe the government supplemented some of this with a grant to private institutions for students who met a merit criterion. But my point is that this is very little money and you can see why it would be quite difficult to recruit and retain high quality teaching talent.<p>The top-tier institutions - the IITs, IISc, IISERs, ISI and so on - don't have great salaries but they make up for it with prestige, perks (on-campus housing, cheap food, discretionary financial awards) and research grants. But beyond the cream of the crop, unfortunately it isn't a rational economic decision to go into teaching in India. This isn't to say nobody does and I've had a few really great teachers even at my undergraduate school but I also realize that India is a poor country with no social safety net. I'm not going to judge anybody for choosing financial security over social service.",1369330549

5758133,comment,5756134,5757334,1,0,Groxx,,,"So far I'm liking Flickr better, though I've only dipped my toe in.  Uploads (on the site, see [0]) are fast, organizing is fast (though the batch organize is weird IMO), everything can be made private by default easily, and ONE TERABYTE OF STORAGE.  It's also much better for browsing than Picasa Web Albums, which are <i>functional</i> but don't really do it well.  Flickr makes browsing quite pretty (in a good way, mostly) and generally better for showing your photos to someone.<p>Picasa the website is fine, and does just about everything <i>right</i>, though generally not in the most ideal way.  Privacy controls are rich and you can still link directly to a photo to bypass (and revoke existing links).  Albums are functional, face tags are functional (though now they use G+ accounts if you link to contacts... not happy, but I guess it works), comments are a bit hidden but work.  I have several gigabytes in it (and bought more), no problems, no complaints.  Main downside is it has definitely not been updated along with the rest of Google's properties, and it integrates very poorly for the most part (notifications, accounts, weird partial G+ linkage...).<p>Picasa the application is... different, but decent.  It's surprisingly good in a number of ways, and I'd recommend it over iPhoto if only because iPhoto has routinely lost my data during updates, and slows to a crawl after several thousand photos.  Picasa stays fast, searches quickly, organizes oddly but effectively.  It leaves your photos in folders that (basically) match the UI, which may or may not be a good thing for you.<p>Picasa the application <i>when synced to your Google account</i> is slick 95% of the time (it all works as you'd expect), and a total hell-hole of duplication, sync failing, and filename mangling the remaining 5% (though most of that only rears its head when you hook it up for the first time).  The 'Sync to web' on/off switch for each album is handy when it works, but hasn't generally handled turning on dozens at once.<p>I would honestly recommend against the syncing aspect of it, though sadly it's a major selling point.  If you can hook it up once and leave it that way you probably won't have much trouble, but I did a lot of reconnecting, and it definitely got confused sometimes.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5758033"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5758033</a>",1369330500

The Volkswagen seems to be similar in many ways: comparable horsepower, weight, covered rear wheels, etc.  I doubt it'll be $22,000 though.<p>A friend even was able to get similar mpg numbers by boosting the battery pack to a similar capacity (in a competition).  Too bad the market didn't shine on the early Insight.  If I remember correctly, they only sold 20,000 worldwide over its 8 year run.",1369328611

You have to pirate them, since they are just recordings of him doing live shows and are not available commercially.<p>DJ Falcon is part of the French House genre. He has done a few records, but is known primarily for his live DJ shows and his collaborations with Thomas Bangalter of Daft Punk (Together and So Much Love To Give).<p>If you like Daft Punk, especially if you like their Alive 2007 live album, you'll probably like DJ Falcon's live sets. They're rhythmic, melodic, and interesting. There are frequently parts of 3 songs going at one time, which sounds like a recipe for disaster, but turns out utterly sublime.",1369328553

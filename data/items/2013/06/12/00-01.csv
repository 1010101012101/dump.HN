5865776,comment,5863823,5865685,1,0,dragonwriter,,,"> Just to be clear, though, we&#x27;re still doing the 2006 thing, with the only &quot;warrant&quot; being a general FISC ruling on the overall legitimacy of the program. Specifically, that it has acceptable measures in place to reduce and eliminate purely domestic intercepts.<p><i>Just to be clear</i>, that&#x27;s not at all the same thing. FISA warrants have always been allowed to be quite broad, and were primarily concerned with identifying that there was a foreign intelligence target and that appropriate minimization procedures were in place, exactly as is the case now.<p>What was at issue in 2006 had no review from anyone outside of the executive branch for either of those issues.<p>You can oppose what is being done now, but you cannot (without erroneously assuming that everyone else in the world agrees with you on everything <i>but</i> partisanship) validly look at the 2006 polls and the 2013 polls, especially given the difference in both the kind of surveillance at issue (listening in vs. call tracking) and the procedures at issue (warrantless vs. FISA warrants) and makes claims about consistency because they aren&#x27;t about the same things, <i>even</i> if you think that people <i>should</i> feel the same about them.",1370998706

5865774,comment,5864948,5865643,9,0,rW80b2,,,"Here you&#x27;re wrong.  The CIA and some other members of the IC are <i>very</i> selective in who they hire, but not in the way most top-tier companies are.  The issue is applicant clearance. So if you&#x27;re a genius, native-US born linguist who has lived in several Middle Easter countries, speaks Arabic, and has a honors degree from a top school, or a brilliant mathmetician/computer scientist who studied in Eastern Europe and married an Eastern European, it&#x27;s relatively hard to get the level of clearance you need for the CIA, because of the way that foreign residence and/or family and friends count on your clearance questionnaire.  And if you&#x27;ve got this background and smoked a couple of dozen joints in college, getting a clearance becomes near impossible.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re a community-college educated applicant with solid grades and military or law enforcement experience, and no foreign residencies or drug experiences and/or alcohol-related misdemeanors, you&#x27;re golden.  You allude to this phenomenon.<p>But while it relatively easy for a certain kind of applicant to get into the CIA, it&#x27;s far from the truth to say that they&#x27;re not selective.  They&#x27;re incredibly selective, and they&#x27;re excluding some of the most promising candidates that apply because of their particular kind of selectivity.<p>Beside the loss of many highly-qualified applicants (what serious language expert hasn&#x27;t lived overseas?), this is also said to create a certain culture that bears more resemblance to boot camp than to the highly-professional organization the CIA has been traditionally.  Snowden alluded to this in his interview.<p>This is not a secret problem.  In fact, there were quite a few public Senate hearings on the issue after 911.

People are complaining about &quot;NSA spying&quot; or simply &quot;this&quot; and calling it unconstitutional without defining what these actions were and why they are unconstitutional. In the absence of detail, people are substituting their own worst fears. For the most part, that is also the case in the linked articles.<p>So far, by my understanding, we have:<p>1. A court order for Verizon to create a database of phone transaction metadata and make it accessible to the NSA. We don&#x27;t know what (if any) procedures are in place for controlling access to the data.<p>2. A non-technical document claiming that the NSA has direct access to &quot;the servers&quot; and is getting information from several companies. News reports imply that this refers to internal company servers. The companies named unanimously deny that this is the case. We don&#x27;t know the details of what information the NSA is collecting or how they are collecting it; specifically, we do not know and cannot say that they are failing to follow the 4th Amendment and other legal procedures.<p>3. Something called PRISM exists.

But I&#x27;ll also add a fifth reason: the fewer than 2000 FISA orders a year <a href=""http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2013/05/fisacases.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/threatlevel/2013/05/fisaca...</a> , combined with the fact that David Drummond appears confident the average number of people covered per order isn&#x27;t very high. If FISA orders were being used routinely, or even often, to investigate simple immigration cases then there would be a lot more of them; as things are, if you were busted for run-of-the-mill illegal immgration by a FISA order then you&#x27;d have to have been very unlucky. It&#x27;s possible you could be identified by chance as part of a search for terrorists, but again not statistically likely, and as you say the government would want to be very careful about tipping its hand in that situation. There are also NSLs, but Google&#x27;s NSL tally suggests that there aren&#x27;t huge numbers of those per month either.",1370997469

He&#x27;s absolutely right.<p>We have ways of making smart tools. It&#x27;s called &quot;programming&quot; and &quot;database engineering.&quot; That part&#x27;s a little too hard right now, and part of why it&#x27;s hard is because if you try to make it easy to mould a flexible program to try to define what your data means and how it should work, it becomes so generic as to be as unusable and amorphic as a cloud of smoke.<p>I&#x27;ve tried this, moving from a space where Excel was predominantly used, and trying to capture the process into an application. We tried to keep all the customizability and malleability as Excel: but I&#x27;m now convinced that was a huge mistake. It led us into genericland.<p>It <i>is</i> possible to build applications that work for these processes, using the tools of programming and good data design.

Someday we&#x27;ll have a systemsome sort of super-Railsthat makes this so easy that anyone can do it. Someday Programming will be an ancient art, something that only your Grandfather did, like crafting your own tools or woodworking or making jams and jellies.<p>Someday that will be true.

Google is also has billions of data points about all of the individuals that use its services. If those data points were dollars, and the revenue agencies were intelligence agencies, what creative ways might they come up with to disassociate which data point belongs to which user such that they could still use the data but not be compelled to hand it over. Just like they use those free cash dollars rather than hand some percentage over as tax.<p>I&#x27;ve got nothing but respect for the smart people at Google, and still have friends that work there (and folks who used to work here and are now working there :-).

People think the CIA is very selective with who they hire:  they aren&#x27;t.  As a guy whose former company used to make me go to career fairs every now and then to man the booth in the DC area, I was shocked at how many cocky, CIA employees looking for a way to cash in their TS/SCI clearance at a contractor would show up and have AWFUL education credentials (colleges with reputations as being diploma farms with dorms, weak majors, etc).  The CIA is more likely to hire someone who went to a &quot;joke&quot; party school with an A average than someone who went to a difficult school with a C average.  \nI can&#x27;t speak for Snowden&#x27;s skills, since I never knew him.  I will say this:  he worked IT security for a while.  The Federal Government, and particularly IC and DoD IT security has no middle class.

They rely on their Security +, CISSPA, etc certs, which are obtained with cramming courses followed by incredibly easy (for people who are smart enough to code) tests.  Then there are the &quot;red team&quot; folks.

Most of the patents in the case covered other ideas (&#x27;381 patent - &quot;rubber band&quot; scrolling, &#x27;D &#x27;305 patent - home screen design, &#x27;163 patent - double tap to zoom onto a specific block). The &quot;rounded rectangles&quot; issue had little bearing on the verdict.<p>Second - Read patent D&#x27;889 (Please note that it isn&#x27;t a regular patent, rather, it&#x27;s a design patent). The patent specifically (and only) covers a touch-screen handheld tablet shaped like a rounded rectangle, with a thin bezel, edge-to-edge glass, and minimal extras, a charging port at the bottom and no stylus. It&#x27;s hardly as simple as a patent on &quot;rounded corners&quot; - it&#x27;s a patent on very specific design features, and if a single one was changed, the patent wouldn&#x27;t apply (and it didn&#x27;t!).",1370995904

Any unencrypted-but-legit payment pages undermine the lesson that payment pages should be SSL-only, when we should be encouraging it.",1370995233

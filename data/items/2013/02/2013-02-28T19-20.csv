My wife and I looked for a younger large breed dog for nearly a year, and were turned away at every local shelter because our yard wasn't fenced and we both worked full time. A few years earlier, living in an apartment disqualified us from adopting a cat in Massachusetts.  We drove 3 hours to adopt a cat from New York, and 2 hours to buy a dog in New Hampshire.<p>Looking at petfinder for my area, the only dogs in shelters nearby are ""imported"" from Puerto Rico, and even those only go to homes that are worthy.

5300573,comment,5300064,5300212,1,0,robomartin,,,"> Overhead is what would it cost for the business to exist, but to create nothing and ship nothing.<p>OK, taken to an extreme this means a few hundred dollars a year to simply exist as an LLC.  I know that's not what you meant.<p>> ""how much of the capital will NOT go to create value for the investors?""<p>In the case of a typical minimal startup one could easily argue that nearly every dime you spend is going to go towards creating value for investors.  In other words, if you need to rent a small space for three people to work together than create the software, well, that's creating value for the investors.<p>Now, if you decided to spend money buying fancy desks, printing unnecessary business cards prematurely, installing a large flat-screen TV in the office and more along those lines clearly there would be a number of line items that are not directly involved in generating investor value.  I guess I am arguing that this is not the case for the vast majority of startups.  In fact, most of them do (and should) not spend a dime on anything that is not directly related to what is needed to launch the product.<p>Not trying to be obtuse.  I am actually trying to figure out if there's a reasonably objective way to define this for a web/software startup.  So far everything I've been able to dig up is nebulous and non-conclusive.<p>Maybe the ""proper"" analysis is in phases.  On the assumption of responsible management, during the pre-launch and launch phase every dime spent is spent to build the software product.  Overhead, in this case, might be limited to rent, utilities, capex (?), marketing and a few other things.  Once the site is launched you could easily argue that a portion of developer cost as well as infrastructure (server) cost could be allocated at a per-user rate to the cost of ""making"" the product.  In other words, that would be excluded from overhead.  If you lost users you'd need half the servers, therefore anything past one minimal server just to have a website falls outside of the definition of overhead.<p>Perhaps the judges wanted to learn something akin to your other comment: ""how well have you planned to spend what you hope to raise in this round?""  Or, during pre-launch and initial launch, are you going to spend any money on anything outside creating direct value for users and investors alike.<p>I am somewhat surprised that such a simple question can have so many tentacles.",1362081407

5300568,comment,5300255,5300463,38,0,JPKab,,,"I think the point that is left out by the article, but emphasized by Robert Lustig (Dr. mentioned in the article) is that sugar, in nature, is almost always accompanied by large quantities of fiber, which prevent it from being absorbed too quickly.<p>Sugar isn't toxic, but refined sugar, or sugar that has been separated from the fiber it sits with (fruit juice) is indirectly toxic.  Dr. Lustig's research has demonstrated this, and he has some very detailed lectures on the subject.  He isn't some quack:  he is a leading researcher in both understanding AND TREATING pediatric Type II Diabetes, which is a newly occurring disease.<p>When I drink a beer, I understand that the alcohol I love so much in it is essentially a toxin, that in low enough quantities won't hurt me.  I also know that regualr, periodic consumption of it will negatively effect my health.  Oddly enough, Lustig's research has shown that fructose, in quantities which are completely normal for someone who has just consumed a moderate amount of refined sugar or fruit juice, has a very similar effect on the liver to alcohol.  Not completely identical, but similar.  I suggest you watch the video.<p>I have a 6 year old son and a second child on the way.  The only fruit juice he gets to have is extremely diluted with water.  This isn't me overreacting as an ignoramus.  I've looked at the data, evaluated the research, and found it extremely compelling.  Ever use a juicer?  Think about how many oranges it takes to make an 8 oz. glass.  (It takes several, and if you tried to eat that many, you would be full halfway through due to the fiber.) Refined sugar is just juiced sugar cane with extra chemical preparation.<p>Oranges are good for you.  Orange juice is bad for you. I know it screams out BS, but I assure you, look at the science.  You will, as I was, be shocked.  How the hell can this stuff I've been eating all my life be THIS bad for me, without me knowing it.",1362081370

Cash is pretty clear -- it means dollar notes and coins.  The definition of a negotiable instrument is that it must be exchangeable for a fixed amount of money, specifically money that is the fiat currency.

Private businesses may adopt their own policies on whether or not to accept cash as long it doesn't violate state law.""<p>So when you say this: ""all governments and businesses can not refuse to be paid in dollars""<p>You've misinterpretted the law.<p>And when you say this: ""Thus, if you try to pay me in Bitcoins in return for mowing your lawn, I can laugh in your face, but I can't refuse your dollars and demand that you pay me in Bitcoin.""<p>head asplode!</i><p>I apologize, I overreached.<p>You are completely right, two entities can pre-negotiate a contract for any kind of exchange of payment and good/services in advance.<p>However, barring any such advance negotiations, you can't refuse my payment in dollars for a debt incurred by delivery of a good or service, and I can't force you to take any other form of payment.<p>This doesn't pertain to a retail purchase, since there is no debt until the item is delivered -- if you want me to pay you in BTC, or jellybeans, or rubles for that candy bar, that's fine.<p>But, if you mow my lawn for $25 and I don't specify how I'm going to pay you, then you are within your rights to demand that I pay you in dollars, and not $25 worth of BTC.",1362080908

It's just that at that rate you'll find it hard to book 350 days / year. Billable days are anywhere from 125 to 200 / year depending on your rate, reputation and skillset. If you bill $2k/day (definitely doable) you'll find that it gets harder to book all your days, it's simply demand and supply. Elsewhere in this thread someone is charging $800 / hour, which is great, you would only have to work a very small number of hours at that rate to have a living, or you could work a much larger number of hours and save like crazy.

In short, it controlled for everything controllable, and it satisfied the longstanding Bradford Hill criteria for whats called medical inference of causation by linking dose (the more sugar thats available, the more occurrences of diabetes); duration (if sugar is available longer, the prevalence of diabetes increases); directionality (not only does diabetes increase with more sugar, it decreases with less sugar); and precedence (diabetics dont start consuming more sugar; people who consume more sugar are more likely to become diabetics).""<p>As far as observational studies, (of which I am a huge skeptic), this one is pretty well controlled for.

The tldr is I've always had a better impression of Hinton than Hawkins, and have studied/followed Hinton's approaches much more carefully.<p>In late 2006/early 2007 I was working a lot with standard two layer feed-forward neural networks (first for my research and then for my job). Hinton had a great paper on practical deep networks at NIPS 2006 (a big AI/machine learning conference), which sparked my interest in more complex neural networks. I had read Hawkins' book a few years earlier, and my impression of it was somewhat negative; I thought it was a really interesting book, but it was too fluffy and high-level to be intriguing. He hit a lot of points about hierarchies in intelligence that were intriguing but not new or drastically insightful. After NIPS I downloaded some of Numenta's code (numenta is Hawkins' company) and it was pretty slow on toy problems so I didn't spend too much time with it - this isn't a judgement of their code, I just didn't have the time to dig deeply into it.

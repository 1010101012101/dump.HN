Yes, the atmosphere is (very slowly) stripped away by the solar wind, so we could not simply terraform it and forget about it. On the other hand, the timescale is very long by human standards, so as long as we produced new atmosphere at a rate faster than it is being stripped away, I don't see it being a fundamental problem. I could be wrong, of course.",1353632377

4820605,comment,4820431,4820582,2,0,Peteris,,,"Thanks, yeah that was a bit of shame; I actually discovered logic programming through Clojure's core.logic. Definitely logic and probabilistic programming are some of the most useful DSL's that can be built. The power is there, it's perhaps the case that Prolog compilers have a much longer history of optimizations, so it might take a while to catch up even though core.logic has some convincing benchmarks too.<p>Another area is functional logic programming. I've played around with Curry, and it's great and it feels even better than just having a logic DSL. The way you can represent strongly typed bi-directional declarative regular expression parsers is simply magic.<p>It's an exciting decade for logic :).",1353632273

Arab nationalism was against current foreign policy of Saudi Arabia and was in fact pretty secular and very progressive for its time. The US didn't want them because ""it waz teh commiez"".<p>I thought that was a widely known fact... that was the time when the US backed the Taliban/Bin Laden, they actually made Rambo III about it.<p>So, actually, yes, I think there would most certainly be less oppression of woman if the US had backed out from middle east in the 70s. I think almost every serious historian/sociologist or layperson who knows about politics in that region would agree with me, I've actually spoke to many who do, even sociologists that study Islam and Middle East with CIA grants. What they definitely don't agree with me is basically how much what they call ""political stability"" in that region is worth.<p>TL, DR; Yes, I think if the US had backed out in the past there would be less oppression of woman. I think ""the US"" also thinks it, but they just don't care and want a stable regime so that oil prices don't fluctuate chaotically due to heavy speculation.<p>EDIT: Got four e-mails about this... If someone wants references, I was just compiling some but realized that Chapter 2 of Perilous Power by Chomsky/Achcar is most likely the best place to start. So sorry, no Wikipedia or newspaper article that accurately portrays what I'm trying to explain as an undisputed fact... get used to reading and debating a lot if you want to get into Middle East politics.",1353632222

4820537,comment,4817446,4819116,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"> <i>What super rational system developed from first principles by the greatest minds of all time did you have in mind here?</i><p>I was referring more to the presumption that all complex systems, everywhere, can be replaced with a positively designed rational system. This is pretty hard to refute amongst the HN crowd because our entire bread and butter is creating positively designed rational systems. It's what we do.<p>As I said further down, in the limited case of laws, the civil laws have tried to replace a historical patchwork of custom, local rules and decrees by a single, positively designed, single rational system of law.<p>But this still frequently turns out to be inadequate. Injustices and oddities pile up around a glitch, which is modified in isolation; then more small changes occur, until a new pattern is recognised by the legislature and the code is rewritten.<p>Sound familiar? It should: in practice the civil law winds up being adaptive, just like the common law. At least the common law doesn't delude itself into thinking the whole thing could be nutted out from the very beginning.<p>Software engineers should know better. Just look at the archives of the IETF sometime. Here intelligent individuals discuss, design and promulgate the protocols that make the modern world pulse with activity -- the technology that makes it possible for us to retread an argument that is at least several hundred years old.<p>Yet RFCs are periodically deprecated and replaced with updates. Why? Because of unforeseen circumstances, errors, abuses and so forth. No matter how intelligent the designers, they were simply unable to foresee all the possible cases in advance. And the IETF, like the Common law, places intelligent, localised-to-problem adaptation of existing principles at the centre of its mechanism.<p>> <i>Your position seems to be that we've stumbled upon a system of law here that introduces very little accidental complexity and that handles well the essential complexity of the real world.</i><p>I'm sorry if I gave that impression. The legal system can and does sometimes impose enormous drag. The the extent that laws become onerous and the legal system highly unpredictable, it's necessary to petition to legislature to reform them. Patent law is certainly one such topic.<p>But the complexity of legal <i>reasoning</i> is not accidental complexity, in the sense Brooks was talking about. It is essential complexity. It exists in the problem domain, which is all relations between human beings.",1353630168

It's important to know the ecosystem of the area you're going into - where the needs are, who the customers are, what the value chain looks like etc, and typically this would best be gained by work experience rather than theory.<p>There's many examples of successful people who never completed or went to college: e.g. Richard Branson, Henry Ford, David Ogilvy, Pete Cashmore, Walt Disney etc et al. Richard Branson once noted that the first three months of running a business teaches you more than three years at business school.<p>So it's not to say higher education isn't valuable, but 'learning' isn't confined to the classroom and practice oft trumps theory :)",1353629633

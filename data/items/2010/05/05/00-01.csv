1319859,comment,1319694,1319694,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This is just another example of the ""clear only if known"" (COIK) problem, which is pervasive especially in tech. The proper way to explain a complicated system to someone who doesn't know anything about it already is to start with the most basic of simplifications, start with a mental model and build up from there, adding levels of detail at each step, making sure that each level of detail makes sense in the context of the previous level. Working from overly simplistic, inaccurate abstractions down to the nitty gritty details.<p>Instead what tends to happen is that people describe each component in detail and the entire system in too much detail. None of it makes sense because none of it has context, but eventually with persistence and immersion it may make sense, but it's a lot more difficult than it should be. Nobody sensible tries to teach someone about how cars work by giving them a circuit diagram of the EFI system, yet that's not too far off how many devs are introduced to complex systems in software engineering.<p>The problem is far worse than this may seem though. Because at a very fundamental level software engineering lacks a common set of abstractions and a common language to even properly discuss software design at a wide range of levels of abstraction. This is reflected not just in problems educating ""noobs"" but also in the very design of most software. This lack of vocabulary and mental models is devilishly intertwined with a distinct lack of design patterns at certain scales in software, which helps explain why so much software tends to be a tangled mess of crap rather than well-designed and modular. We build big ball of mud after big ball of mud instead of tractors, cathedrals, and cruise ships partly because we don't have the intellectual tools (vocabulary, models, design patterns, etc.) to tackle design problems on that scale.<p>Compare the complexity of software architecture patterns such as MVC or layering to the construction patterns of, say, an automobile, a house, or an airplane.

As a staunch believer in the disconnect between academic achievement and real programming competence, I would suggest that the comment is true - but you've survived an arbitrary system constructed to achieve very little. It's a little bit like finding your way out of a garden maze - amusing and interesting perhaps, probably difficult, but the relation of this accomplishment to anything else is hazy.<p>> <i>""They enter an environment, evaluate it critically to figure out what skills they need to succeed and thrive in said environment.""</i><p>Perhaps - but assuming the goal is to be a great programmer (or whatever else your passion may be), why would you spend all your time and effort defeating this arbitrary system as opposed to pursuing things that actually make you a better programmer? (or carpenter, or doctor, or what-have-you).<p>That's the disconnect that I see. Academic performance is measured in such a way that doesn't shed light on real ability, and in fact much of the curriculum for a lot of degrees/certificates bear little relevance to the job they supposedly train for. Beating this system is IMHO meaningless, since it contributes little to your professional abilities.<p>Which is also why I think the medciore grades sometimes get a lot of love - I know more than a few people who eschewed academia in exchange for actually getting their hands dirty and writing a lot of code. They learned what they needed to learn from school, and spent the rest of the time perfecting their craft instead. IMHO these people make stronger programmers than those who spent their time and effort optimizing for something that <i>isn't</i> their end goal.<p>When I was in college, I knew a few people who were hardcore academics. They hit the books <i>really hard</i>, got great grades, aced exams regularly, and generally were kicking ass. What they were <i>not</i> doing was developing their professional abilities - so they graduated with little to no practical experience under their belt. They were rudely surprised when their intensely deep knowledge of a great number of theories weren't at all attractive to employers who needed people to get things done.<p>I also knew this one guy who was academic <i>and</i> spent a lot of time honing his real, executable skills. He's a superstar.<p>Given that, I would say that the real discerning variable here is how much practice you've had at programming - the variable of academic achievements is really largely independent from competence as a hacker.<p>> <i>""there is nothing that stops a high achiever from being a passionate, free-thinking, risk-taker""</i><p>I would agree with this point with some caveats, but this comment strikes me as particularly arrogant:<p>> <i>""good grades make better anything""</i><p>Really man, really? Wow, thanks for reinforcing the ivory-tower holier-than-thou stereotype that academics surely must love having.<p>[edit] At the risk of being inflammatory, a lot of this ""high grades make better everything"" hubbub seems like sour grapes from people who optimized for the wrong variable, and are now frustrated that the ""losers"" from before have become the winners (insofar as employment goes anyhow), and that the variable they were taught to religiously optimize turned out to be a bit pointless (for the purposes of employment, anyhow).",1273018052

As it stands you can easily change a MAC address and the translation of private -> public IP address done by a NAT capable network device combines the traffic of multiple computers to look like it is a single one.  This means you can only attribute file sharing activity to a public ip which in practice might have numerous clients behind it.<p>Hence if there were a law like that and everyone obeyed it then you could generally identify the exact machine that did the file sharing.",1350849469

The problem with arguing from a postmodern perspective is that the argument instantly self-destructs (it applies first to itself, which means if you're right, then I have the right to ignore you).<p>The essential foundation of dialogue is consensus, shared ideas, and shared word definitions. Without those, there's no possibility for dialogue.<p>> Your definition of algebra (beyond the naming of symbols, or variables in programming parlance) is not useful to most people.<p>Utility is not the basis on which words are defined. Words mean what they mean, how we feel about those meanings is irrelevant.<p>> I think people would be much better served implicitly dropping out than explicitly.<p>So those who are qualified to be in school can be surrounded by those who aren't?<p>> If they understood it [science] was much more about teamwork and physical setting up and running equipment/software and thinking creatively ...<p>That's not what science is about, unless plumbing is about wrenches.

This puts together a number of really neat ideas that I plan to totally pick apart and use individually.<p>It's all the little details that makes a form either dull and predictable or a total joy to use. You may not even notice it but the design and interactivity of a form really makes a big difference when it comes to your use of it. I truly believe the right form design makes a big impact on conversions and a person's impression of a site, especially one that makes heavy use of text input.<p>A lot of people neglect the typography of form inputs. The cursor is also something I've really been interested in changing. The shape and/or the color of it is something that can really delight a user.<p>Think of the text editors and word processors we use. Many are fairly consistent but you see much more variation of the editable area in desktop software than on the web. Apps like iA Writer, Mou, and others make the act of typing text so inviting that just having them open, at least for me and I assume many others, compels you to fill that space with text.<p>I love writing and I'm fascinated by the design of text input fields whether they be normal one line inputs or text areas so this project is something I'm excited to explore.",1350849088

4680552,comment,4679756,4680322,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"You've missed the second part, which is reading out the sorted list. By storing which numbers you've seen, in a virtual bit field you have 'codified' in the index of the bit field the seen number. Thus to 'print the sorted list' you simply go through the bit field starting at index zero and print any index in the bit field that is a 'one'. That is your sorted list of numbers.<p>The reason this was an interview question was because it allowed the interviewer to see if the candidate could see 'past' the requirement of sorting (which pre-loads your mental algorithm cache with all sorts of algorithms) to the somewhat more subtle concept of embedding partial computation into the data structure.<p>Early in my career at Sun I was tasked with putting mandatory file and record locking into UFS in the kernel, the challenge had always been how do you avoid deadlock? Of course one level deadlock was fairly easy, you need to know if process A is holding a lock and waiting on process B which is holding a lock elsewhere, and you are in the context of process B trying to get this lock then you can see that you will deadlock A. But 'n' level deadlock starts getting harder because the possibilities multiply. I discovered that you could create a doubly linked tree structure which had modest memory growth per-process but any process could walk it one way and look for 'itself' on the list to discover if there was a deadlock possible. Here the 'code' was walk a list and note that you were already on it, so you would deadlock if you got the lock.<p>The number 'sorting' problem is very much like that because while numbers have different values, they are intrinsic values. Unlike strings which consist of an arbitrary sequence of tokens. So the goal of the question was to identify people who could see the difference between 'sorting numbers' as a problem and 'general sorting.'",1350848660

The difference is that instead of hiring various independent companies to do the policing (which ended in a lot of false positives, probably because those companies were trying to turn over as many IPs as possible), they've pooled their resources to create a single streamlined process.<p>Now there are a couple of reasons they would want to downplay the real purpose of this system. First, ISPs aren't going to get on board with a ""help us sue your customers"" plan. But ""help us educate your customers about copyright"" is probably appealing to an ISP. And as far as the public is concerned, it's a good bet that some details of this would have gotten leaked if they had tried to just keep it under wraps.

Some years ago I had occasion to email them about something, and thinking that a company called Sleepycat Software would still be a one- or two-person enterprise, I added in the email that I liked their name and, as it happened, I had a kitty on my lap at that moment.<p>The reply gave me a chuckle, as it made clear that the company had grown significantly and that some of the new employees found the name a bit embarrassing.<p>Anyway -- one thing I've learned about Purr Programming -- don't let the cat have the keyboard.

If and when we beat cancer, the solution will not present itself as a magic pill.<p>Therefore for any instance of magic pills (glyconutrients included) we can infer that it won't cure cancer with any reliability. You can have a narrow tool that strikes one kind of cancer and does nothing (or even harms a little) on all others, or we can have something that comforts you a bit but without much statistical outcome.<p>If you have malignant cells dividing inside you, they would not be easily stopped.<p>Trying to self-medicate a random cancer with a random magic pill will likely yield no result at all - or maybe only from Placebo effect.<p>Therefore if you're at earlier stage, your best bet is conventional treatment, and if you're at late stage, it might be better to spend the remaining time wisely.",1350846402

If we can abstract a value to a symbol, we then can operate on the symbol rather than the value, greatly increasing the generality of mathematical ideas. Which operation is more useful: sqrt(2) or sqrt(x)? Another example -- which is more useful: D(7^n) = 7^n * log(7) or D(x^n) = n * x^(n-1)? (The first can only be applied to 7, the second can be applied to any values of x and/or n.)<p>* As to the second, algebra is much more useful now than it was 100 years ago. Those who don't learn algebra are inviting politicians to lie to them, which they will certainly do if given a chance.<p>> Maths as traditionally taught is the leading cause of high school dropouts rates ...<p>This confuses cause and effect. If we drop math education to prevent dropouts, we will have implicit dropouts (people who drop out but without physically leaving) instead of explicit ones.<p>> ... people who might have been scientists turning to arts instead ...<p>One's preference for art over science has deeper roots than a lack of comprehension of mathematics.

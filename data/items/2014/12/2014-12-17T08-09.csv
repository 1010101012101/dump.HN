8761623,comment,8761076,8761502,0,0,Mikhail_Edoshin,,,"I agree that weighting is the key to stability for professional cooks and bakers, but up to a gram or not depends on what you&#x27;re weighting, how much of it, and for what purpose (and yes, the gram itself as a unit is irrelevant). This is engineering tolerance and it&#x27;s same in every field; even a fine metalworker can be imprecise provided he stays within the defined range.<p>Yet for part-time cooks as most of us are weighting is impractical: we don&#x27;t have scales, and even if we do the amounts are usually too small. And stability is not necessary the goal :) For home cooks the usual task is to scale a recipe up or down and with cooking units the math is much simpler. Another thing about cooking units is that the number of different units helps to convey that engineering tolerance I&#x27;ve mentioned; the smaller the unit, the less the tolerance. When everything is expressed in one unit, you need to specify the tolerance explicitly.",1418806587

I get it! I&#x27;m sure Linus was well aware of that when he made this remark. However, the point Linus was making (in a humorous way) was that like most computer scientists / mathematicians, Dijkstra was overly fond of obscure, single-letter names, which nobody ever intuitively understands. Whereas the names &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; (see the rest of Linus&#x27; quote) are far more intuitive.

But I think it&#x27;s far fetched to see her approval as a positive message. There are women out there contributing to the objectification of women too, for whatever reason they have. (One weird side of this is people think women are shielded from criticism of their own objectification, but it&#x27;s a delicate matter to say the least. One has the right to objectify <i>themselves</i> so it&#x27;s hard to say something without getting in the way of their right to self express.) There are more than one side to this issue; but it&#x27;s not about her consent, it&#x27;s about how it might be contributing to boys club image of tech.<p>It&#x27;s easy to see that we have a problem of the lack of women in tech. I find this very depressing since they&#x27;re able as much as men are and it looks wasteful to dismiss half the population. I think we&#x27;re getting better each day, but it does not happen magically. People fight for it and will keep fighting until there&#x27;s no discrimination based on sex. I accept that Lena image is one of the minor issues, but I still see this as one of the factors that drives women away. This boys club image of tech gives the implicit message that women are not wanted here.<p>I know there&#x27;s no nudity in the image and one needs to research to find its origins in Playboy so it seems unlikely to come across it. But the real reason here is if we&#x27;re willing to combat sexism, it will give women comfort that we&#x27;re willing to change tradition to be more welcoming. I believe actions speak louder than words, and if the reason to keep the tradition is not all that important, we should do it.<p>(I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to compare it to an image of a naked guy, since it&#x27;s unlikely to drive boys away from tech. It&#x27;s not just naked guy vs. naked girl, the context and the message makes a world of difference.)",1418805407

So many of those planets are unsuitable for any life, microbial or otherwise, but such a large number fills me with hope that the unlikely miracle of eukaryotic evolution could happen more than once.

Jefferson suggested a decimal system based off the seconds pendulum at 45¬∞ latitude. He did this in coordination with scientists in France with the direct goal of achieving a universal standard. Before congress could adopt this system, the French modified their standard:<p><i>Although French scientists working on a decimal system had originally supported using the seconds pendulum as a scientific basis, and Jefferson had deliberately matched his seconds pendulum proposal to the French one, based on a measurement at the latitude of Paris, the French decided to use the length of a meridian of the Earth instead of a seconds pendulum. This and other developments changed what had promised to be an internationally developed system into a strictly French project. Jefferson wrote, &quot;The element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, ipso facto, every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them.&quot;</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformity_in_the_Coinage,_Weights,_and_Measures_of_the_United_States#Subsequent_developments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_for_Establishing_Uniformit...</a><p>As a result the US wound up passing on Jefferson&#x27;s system and eventually settling on US &quot;customary&quot; units.<p>The real benefit of adopting the metric system is to have a consistent, widespread system of units. The United States has had this for over 200 years and most sectors of the economy have been isolated enough from Europe and the rest of the world where adopting metric has not been worth it. Industries that are increasingly global (automotive, electronics, etc) have already effectively adopted metric.",1418803527

You need it to initiate phone calls from your app, right?<p>This kind of thing is why I can&#x27;t see myself switching to Android as my primary mobile OS any time soon. If anything, I can see a bright future for Microsoft. In spite of the fact Windows Phone exists, Android is very much the Windows of the mobile ecosystem.<p>Permissions on Android are horrendous for developers. But they are even worse for users. If a developer can&#x27;t tell the difference between ACTION_CALL and ACTION_DIAL, what chance does the average end-user have?<p>And when every app requests at least half a dozen permissions, how many users are going to carefully review each and every permission and how many are just going to give up and grant all requested permissions to every app the way that everyone reflexively clicks &quot;agree&quot; to every online ToS? Even if Android actually had a working method to deny individuals permissions, nobody ever has any idea which permissions are essential to which classes of app and which should be treated with suspicion.<p>Compare this to iOS, where you may occasionally get asked to grant an app access to contacts or location - this is a rare occurrence and you can choose deny every time with no negative consequences (except for restricting that functionality).<p>The comment by jbk illustrates just how big a mess permissions on Android are, beyond just being confusing. On top of that you&#x27;ve got custom intents, which while a great idea on paper, just pile more complexity on top of a broken foundation of complexity and obfuscation.<p>This IMO is the single biggest thing wrong with Android, which Google should prioritise fixing like Microsoft in 2002. Never mind signed-app stores like Play: the fundamentally broken security model is the reason why Android is the only mobile platform to have a problem with malware. It&#x27;s also a brilliant case study in over-engineering with a complete failure to consider human psychology.",1418803316

Of course, replacing hamburger for steak in the calculations would reduce the inflation rate, but it represented the rate of inflation in terms of maintaining a declining standard of living. Cost of living was being replaced by the cost of survival. The old system told you how much you had to increase your income in order to keep buying steak. The new system promised you hamburger, and then dog food, perhaps, after that.",1298753650

2266487,comment,2266124,2266406,0,0,strmpnk,,,"I completely agree here. While I think node.js will have a certain amount of success, its biggest limit is and will continue to be the utterly poor composability of code. You can't just take other code and call it anymore. It has to be written to interact not only asynchronously but ALSO track and maintain state the same way other code is handled that might be using it.<p>Solutions that make this transparent almost always return to heavy constructs that people like Ryan Dahl called out as big scaling problems (like threads). Just shoveling state around is a mess and abstractions around it almost always reinvent the smalltalk-style spaghetti stack.<p>I'm not sure node.js has a clear option moving forward. Right now the library choice for this is pretty wide, so fragmentation is a problem. While it's hard to choose sometimes, right now the community really needs some direction.<p>Meanwhile, languages and platforms that have already chosen their concurrency primitives, be it goroutines and channels, erlang processes and messages, or even ugly threads and locks, seem to be moving forward. It's not about defeating some other method of expressing things. It's about providing something that works and right now node.js only solves half of the problem.",1298753435

Todd Bishop is a great guy and he had done an earlier article on an older app of mine so this was a nice tie-in.<p>- Mail Anne Eisenberg of the NYT and point to both of the above.

He related a story (possibly apocryphal) about Larry Ellison of Oracle and how he would run into meetings of Oracle's sales guys in the early days and berate them for <i>not lying enough</i>. ""If you don't lie nobody will believe you!""<p>Anyway, this guy was saying that this is exactly true. If you don't lie people won't believe you.<p>I've kind of seen it myself in the business world. I also think that it explains much of what we see in the world with regard to religion, political ideologies, superstition, etc.<p>The problem is that the primate social part of our brain interprets uncertainty, skepticism, doubt, and even caution as signifiers of low primate social status. Huge, gargantuan claims, boldness (even if wrong), and certainty are seen as signifiers of alpha status.<p>Thus a certain-of-themselves idiot or nutjob is of higher social status than a cautious, skeptical, rational person.<p>Salesmen exploit this by intentionally telling audacious lies (of a sort) in order to elevate themselves socially in the perception of potential buyers.

Now, build up a few more of these patterns, start watching them intertwine with each other in ways that require you to manually interleave them, come to the realization that building your glorious asynchronous stack on top of a fundamentally synchronous language was a bad idea.<p>In languages that are not fundamentally synchronous, such as Erlang, you do not leap through hoops to manage this. You simply write a function that performs your insertions in the straightforward and obvious way, and the runtime manages it with no blocking at any point.<p>I actually don't like the frequently-made assertion that ""a pattern is automatically a weakness in the language"", but it does apply here. As the Node.js community laboriously builds up the patterns necessary to work in this paradigm, recapitulating the work done in numerous other async-on-top-of-sync-language libraries, it probably is worth keeping the assertion in mind. You shouldn't even have to <i>think</i> about this, let alone argue which way is the best way to do it.<p>(Somebody modded this down. Maybe I should make it clear that I'm actually speaking from experience on another asynchronous project written in Perl on top of glib's asynchronousness, which isn't fundamentally different from Node.js'.

Even a run-time type error would be fine, Erlang mostly works that way (""true and 0"" results in a bad argument exception, unfortunately the ""if"" construct is less picky).

YMMV.<p>It seems to me that Amazon is desperate for you to have Prime, but as what is basically a loyalty program, it doesn't work for them if they simply give it away. The customer has to feel engaged somehow, either by paying for it, or feeling like they're getting something really valuable for some promotional reason. I personally suspect that as the Amazon Mom's year ends or the student's year comes up that the announcement will be made that out of the goodness of their heart, Amazon has decided to simply extend the program for another year or something, and that as they can work out reasonable excuses to give you a free Prime subscription they will continue to do so.

    some models are useful.
</code></pre>
Using the reals as a model makes the math a <i>lot</i> easier than trying to do everything in discrete structures, especially since we don&#x27;t actually know the scales that these discrete structures might be at.  We don&#x27;t know what the smallest unit of space is, and it&#x27;s still not clear that there is one.  As a result we use the reals as a model, and it does incredibly well.<p>So in a sense you are helping support the main point of the original article.  The fact that the reals are an approximation to what you claim reality might be should be acknowledged, and then we should explore the limits and limitations of that models. The Banach-Tarski theorem does exactly that, showing us at least one place there the model apparently fails, and should certainly be treated with care.",1433768282

Even if you built a much longer straight section (you&#x27;re not cornering significantly at these speeds) the question isn&#x27;t going to be how many of them can you get from A to B, it&#x27;s going to be what runs out first, fuel or tires.

I don&#x27;t think those are synonyms or have much to do with each other so the close intermixing is a bit jarring.  Often enough they oppose each other.  They don&#x27;t get along so its hard to use them as supporting arguments even if true.<p>Another observation is hard to quote but boils down to languages and paradigms are synonyms, which I disagree with.  A language is a pile of paradigms wrapped up in some syntax to formalize it.  You can write FORTRAN or perl in any language.  Or functional, at least somewhat.  Its easier to write worse programs than the language and very hard to write better programs than the level of the language.  In that way LISP is the master language above all the others because it can express seemingly anything therefore if everything is beneath it, its above everything.  The third paragraph is closest to what I&#x27;m trying to express and it comes very close to hitting the mark.<p>It would be interesting to see logic programming in a safety critical embedded space.  I&#x27;m not sure if it would be &quot;good&quot; interesting or &quot;train wreck&quot; interesting.  That would be an interesting suggestion for the second to last paragraph.

In short:<p>- The Hyperloop paper doesn&#x27;t mention how trains would cross San Francisco Bay, or include a cost estimate for doing so. A new bridge? A new tunnel? Both would add greatly to the $6 billion cost estimate.<p>- That $6 billion estimate also assumes that elevated concrete pylons can be built for much cheaper than any other project, with no mention of how.<p>- The proposed track doesn&#x27;t go to downtown LA; it ends at Sylmar, which is still ~25 miles from downtown and even further from most of the LA area. A 30 minute ride becomes much less exciting when it takes another hour or more to reach your real destination.<p>- With the proposed 30-second headway, the system&#x27;s capacity is only about 25% of a high-speed rail line, and 30 seconds still violates the crap out of typical safety standards (you can&#x27;t run trains too close together without risking a collision if you can&#x27;t brake quickly enough).<p>- There are no intermediate stations; this is obviously a problem for the Central Valley, but it makes life inconvenient for plenty of other people too. Eg. someone in San Jose (pop. ~1 million, greater than SF&#x27;s) would need to spend an extra hour or more getting to San Francisco vs. a station in San Jose itself.",1433767478

If I don&#x27;t call the other person won&#x27;t either. If I call he/she is busy, on vacation, doing something else. If we meet we can stay up all night, chat, laugh, have a nice time. Then we both go on our separate ways.<p>I really didn&#x27;t understand how this works. I know that now I work a lot. But I wasn&#x27;t like that when I was younger. Nevertheless it was always me that had to keep a relationship going. If I didn&#x27;t do anything things faded away pretty quickly. If I did the relationship agonized for a while before ceasing.<p>I know that I am not unpleasant - people don&#x27;t talk with someone for hours just to be polite. And only one person has ever told me that she always hated me because of how annoyingly smart I was. But then again I went to university where one of my fears was that someone is smarter than I am (and probably a lot of folks actually were).<p>When not at work most people relax with a game of cards, small talk about repairing the car, the new update for the phone, etc. What I do for fun when I am not programming is read about consciousness studies, biology and nutrition, philosophy, physics. If the person is up for it we can talk for hours on such a topic. But most people most of the time are not. I have two kids and I like talking about them - kids are fascinating and incredibly funny at the same time. However people who don&#x27;t have kids don&#x27;t have a clue what I am talking about (I was the same when I didn&#x27;t have kids). People who have kids usually just want a beer. I like running, hiking, riding a bike - good topics for a conversation. Until I say that it&#x27;s fun to ride a bike at night, while it&#x27;s raining.<p>So I was at lunch with my colleagues one day and it suddenly hit me - the problem is not that I am smarter or a genius or the like. It would be nice, but actually most of my colleagues are as smart as I am and some of them are smarter. The problem is that I cope with pain and hurdles differently. When people stop to rest I usually push some more. When they seek a shelter from the rain I want to ride more. When they need to chat with someone I need to read a book. I am a hyperactive introvert with a strange set of interests. I am a little different and because of that it&#x27;s much harder for me to make friends.<p>You say that you have started so many projects. To me this means that you have a lot of energy and it&#x27;s quite possible that people just don&#x27;t want to play catch up with you – it’s tiring for them and they may actually prefer to just relax.",1433767357

This is the only specific painpoint the blog post mentions with Rust, and its just a single anecdote.<p>2. The idea that Rust is a premature optimization is a weird meme.

Rust is a language that became stable 3 weeks ago and time has not yet told whether it will be &#x27;mainstream&#x27; or not.<p>Rust has a memory model that includes some degree of manual management, like C (instead of malloc/free and pointer arithmetic, you have ownership and references).

A $10 million investment for 10% equity with a 1x preference in a company with $18 million in assets is not as risky as the headline grabbing $100 million valuation might make us believe.",1433767026

In addition, he predicts that there are no proofs of the abc conjecture that use significantly different techniques than those used in his papers.[17] There was a workshop on IUT at Kyoto University in March 2015 and another one will be held at Clay Mathematics Institute in December 2015.[18]<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture#Attempts_at_solution"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abc_conjecture#Attempts_at_solu...</a>",1433766939

Be with the crowd sometime but not all the time.  As there&#x27;s also things to be learned from other people too.   And it&#x27;s great being able to be your own person and ignore that crowd.<p>Given, I greatly prefer Van Gogh to Picasso and Matisse, it&#x27;s probably just as likely his mental state were an influence of his art, not the whole loneliness thing.  Drawing the conclusion the other way seems dangerous, to encourage isolation.  However it&#x27;s good to say it&#x27;s not ok, or not one&#x27;s fault.<p>It&#x27;s hard especially due to &#x27;fake socialization&#x27; like Facetube and such, smartphones, and people&#x27;s busy isolated schedules involving central air conditioning to expand a circle of people you know.  It seems dangerous to say to be creative you must be lonely, it&#x27;s very wrong.  Yet it&#x27;s also wrong to say it&#x27;s wrong to be lonely, because of factors that make it a really hard thing.<p>I think we need to suggest to other people that <i>aren&#x27;t</i> so isolated to reach out and be friendly to more people.  In the south (of the US) it <i>used</i> to be increasingly common for people to say hi to people they met out walking, and increasingly as people move in from other places, it&#x27;s rare when someone says hi back.  Then people go back into their houses and you don&#x27;t see them again.<p>The problems that cause society to be isolating are somewhat improveable, but it requires awareness of it.  I think it&#x27;s possible Van Gogh didn&#x27;t really want to be isolated, but that was his way of justifying it and being ok with it, and that his feelings of isolation were rooted in deeper problems.<p>We&#x27;ll never know.  But if you are feeling isolated or whatever, don&#x27;t feel you have to be that way.  It&#x27;s not your fault though something you have to fight for (because everybody is caught up in doing whatever they are doing), it&#x27;s everybody else&#x27;s fault to a degree, and you can be creative either way.",1433766524

Humans beings aren&#x27;t wired to intuitively think like a constraint solver.<p>I&#x27;m not an experienced developer but my thinking on this issue is that the platform should provide some functionality to achieve the most common boiler-plate layouts and anything more complex should be written in code.<p>Usually constraints are simple and so are the layouts.

The constraints were making me tear my hair out and finally I wrote 5 lines of custom layout code and it took me only ten minutes and this was after futzing about with the constraints for half an hour and it did what I wanted to on an iPhone , iPad and for any height or width.<p>I personally believe in a simplified version of FlexBox for common cases (yes I think it needs to be even simpler) and custom code for anything more complex.<p>Bringing in all the baggage of a constraint solver to do your layout is like trying to use an Abrams Tank to kill a mouse.",1433766153

When we look closely at things, we always find combinatorial structures of discrete entities (smooth matter -> atoms -> protons -> quarks). For example, electrical charge is discrete, not continuous, and the unit appears to be 1/3 the charge on the electron (as carried by quarks).<p>The balance of evidence is that our universe is spatially compact, with time bounded in the past (Big Bang), so it is possible that there are no infinities at the cosmological scale either. The evidence for the temporal future has recently changed from closed (Big Crunch) to open (infinite expansion).<p>There are various theories about how space and time emerge from discrete quantum mechanical structures. For example, a simple derivation in Loop Quantum Gravity gives a discrete spectrum for area. At the moment, we don&#x27;t know which theory is correct, but it is likely there is a smallest finite unit of area (and volume).<p>Another reason for rejecting real numbers in physics, is that each value contains an infinite amount of information. The Holographic Principle is interesting because it rejects the notion of an infinite amount of information in a finite space. In fact, it goes a lot further, and says the total information within a 3D volume does not scale as the volume (!), but as the 2D surface area. Essentially there is one bit per Planck Area, so 10^66 bits/m^2.<p>It is easy to imagine, but not to describe or prove, a combination of these theories that implies everything is finite, discrete and combinatorial, without an infinity or a real number in sight.",1433766057

Only claims of personal benefit in terms of calm and compassion, plus an increasing body of scientific evidence of cognitive benefits.<p>Invisible men in the sky are the antithesis of Vipassana, and anyone who uses it to ensnare anyone are frauds. The only benefits are within yourself, and the teachings make that abundantly clear.<p>Also, implying that Vipassana and meditation can harm anyone is absolutely ridiculous. It cannot do that anymore than reading a book or eating breakfast can.",1433765472

Some would say that we should only treat it as an Integer if we intend to do computations on it (for example adding those 2 apples to another 3 apples), to which I&#x27;d ask how come the word&#x27;s essence (its &quot;transformation&quot; from a String to an Integer) changes depending on the type of action we intend to apply on it? (so to speak, English is not my primary language).<p>Anyway, things in this domain are damn complicated, and have been so for the last 2500 years at least, starting with Socrates (or was it Plato, in fact?) who was asking about the essence/idea of a table (i.e about its type), i.e. is a table still a table if it only has 3 legs remaining? what about two?, and continuing with Aristotle&#x27;s categories and closer to our days with Frege and Cantor (somehow the table problem can be connected to the latter&#x27;s continuum hypothesis, but I digress).

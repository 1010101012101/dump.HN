There are several of these plus radar stations etc.  NOAA uses a subset of that information to make weather forecast (they normally toss out old data and data from the other side of the planet because it's not useful even if it might make a slightly better forecast).  We can make highly accurate block by block forecast an hour ahead over major cities and just about any point in the US.  However, there is little point in reading that level of detail from a forecast for such a short period of time.  Sometimes when the forecast is 50% chance of rain over the next 8 - 12 hours they know where and when it's going to rain they just don't know where you are.<p>edit: <i>One of the world's largest scientific data systems, NASA's Earth observing system data and information system (EOSDIS) has stored over three petabytes of earth science data in a geographically distributed mass storage system.</i> that's just Nasa and a lot of their data does not make it into EOSDIS.<p>The goal of science is to understand the world.  Running the same simulation on the same data and getting the same result only tells you that the machine running the simulation is not broken.

They run a few different models with different assumptions and pick the average result.  Over time each model is updated independently to maintain its independence.<p>PS:  You don’t validate E=MC^2 by doing the exact same experiment 10,000 times.

I have to admit I'd have to think more carefully about this, but I'm not sure it's a knockdown win either. In the real world, the extra information comes from the environment in its capacity as a selection mechanism. It is a large source of such information. Simulations tend to have a radically simplified selection mechanism, what with not containing reality and all. Just because something looks complicated and can't be effectively gzip'ed doesn't mean its actually high in information, it's tricky stuff. I'd be much more inclined to buy this, if evolutionary programming was much more impressive than it actually is and actually routinely pulled off programs that were clearly high in information value.<p>(I've actually spent a bit of time with evolutionary computation. It has one of the largest hype/reality ratios in computer science.)<p>""Reproducibility does not involve the lab that made the discovery sending the devices used to make the discovery to another lab.""<p>This is an artifact of the fact that is impossible to do this with physical objects, so we've built the mechanics of science around not being able to do that. Don't mistake historical accidents with scientific imperative. While it is still absolutely desirable that simulations as independently-constructed as possible and give as similar a result as possible, if there was an equivalent in the physical world of being able to rigorously examine someone else's experiment we would be doing that. How long would Cold Fusion have lasted if that was available?<p>Science is inevitably a product of its environment. We don't demand particle-physics precision from the sociologists not because it is undesirable, but because it is impossible. We don't pass around experimental apparatus to each other for examination not because it is undesirable, but because it is impossible. It isn't impossible for simulations.

Some general comments about both:<p>Width: To accommodate (almost) everything, most designers keep things to a maximum width of 960px. Your site is 1100px wide. On most sites I'd say this is an issue, because unless you specifically <i>want</i> horizontal scrolling it's a bad idea. Since your site is targeted towards gamers, they might all have monitors that wide--I don't know. I'd take a look at your analytics and make sure that's a safe width. I'll note that even if it is ok it <i>feels</i> really wide. Your designer's done a decent job of keeping it under control from what I can see, but recognize that text that stretches across the whole width is not at all readable.<p>Navigation mouseovers: right now when you mouse over your navigation links, they turn blue and get underlined. The dark blue is hard to see on both sites, and the effect just seems unrelated to anything else on the page. Do one or the other. For the color, I'd go with either the same color as the 'current page' link, or something halfway in between the two. I normally prefer the latter, but you do have to make sure that the difference is enough to be very easily noticeable.<p>Some comments on the new design, specifically:\nFirst, I'd like to say that this is <i>much</i> better in general. It still needs work, but it's much improved.<p>A few relatively minor about the top section:<p>The baseline of the text in the logo should probably align with the baseline of the navigation link text. (I'd cut out some of the shadow or make it fade more quickly so it fits there.)<p>The switch to a serif face for your 'sales pitch' is good--it draws attention to it, and that's what you want. I would recommend getting a little more creative with font choices than Times New Roman though!<p>The snowflakes don't make much sense to me--I just don't know why they're there. It might look better than with a plain or gradient background anyway, but finding something a little more topical might be a good idea.<p>I see what you're trying to do with the computer, but right now it's drawing attention away from your software and putting it on the computer. I think just a screenshot of your software could be much better.<p>The bottom part I think needs some new ideas. It's too same-y (and a bit messy) and my eyes get lost.

This doesn't fix the problem that if a network partition occurs since you still have locality of chunks in a single rack.<p>For more information about how complicated Lustre in a production environment is check out the talks at the last UG by Sun employees (Lessons Learned & Best Practices, Managing High Availability on a Shine-Equipped Lustre Cluster):<p><pre><code>    http://wiki.lustre.org/index.php/Lustre_User_Group_2009\n </code></pre>\nI've not tested Ceph in production but many people I talk to about our Lustre woes recommend Ethan Miller's work - <a href=""http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~elm/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~elm/</a> - which leads to Ceph ;)<p>Even if you aren't worrying about availability, Lustre has issues with usage:<p>Lustre requires older kernels - which means compatibility with modern non-RHEL distros leads to headaches when you need the lastest version of KVM (or python).<p>Lustre also tries to be a POSIX filesystem but it breaks horrible when you try to use features like O_APPEND from multiple nodes (file corruption!)  We are still tracking down Lustre breaking when we read files in a certain order (rsync is ok, but start skipping around in a file read leads to the kernel stopping responding)<p>After months of dealing with Lustre issues with trying to support POSIX I have come to love the non-POSIX (S3-like API) to distributed filesystems.",1264191067

For a couple of months I couldn't express myself clearly, if at all. I couldn't put more than a couple of words together. I only understood about half of what people were saying to me. I couldn't even ask the bus driver to stop so I could get off at my stop.<p>After that short period, though, I became very comfortable communicating in Russian. I realized that there's probably no way to learn a language without going through that painful period. I think the same is true of programming languages. You're going to have to stumble through a couple thousand lines of horribly written code before you become fluent. You might as well start writing those now and get it over with.<p>I just started in a new roller hockey league this week. I still can't skate backwards well. I know that if I want to learn I'm going to have to fall on my butt a bunch of times. As long as I stay cautious and don't allow myself to fall, I'll probably never learn.",1264190900

1070543,comment,1069808,1070329,0,0,jerf,,,"""Weather simulations have even more data; they are less accurate for other reasons.""<p>I doubt anyone can beat particle physics for sheer information quantity. I seriously doubt that we have petabytes of <i>real weather information</i> to feed our simulations. I can find some references online to petabyte stores for weather simulation results online, but that's ultimately just cache, not information (in the information theoretic sense).<p>This is part of what I mean when I talk about the information theory, and how you can't get more information in the information-theoretic sense than the sum total of the simulation and the original data. Weather simulations may chew through terabytes or petabytes of RAM in the simulation phase, but they are not fed that much data. If the people involved mistake it for real information, then this is also part of what I mean when I say that once you get into using computers in a big way my training does indeed start giving me standing to complain again by even the most rigid ""stay out of my science"" standards.<p>Secondly, your assumption that running the simulation again is useless in a world where you can casually assume that you have all the data and the simulation and can have the contempt bred of familiarity for the whole process. In the real world, if you can't replicate the results, how can you criticize the model? I think there's still some ""the computer said it, it must be right"" underlying your answer; you <i>can't assume</i> the computer model is worth anything, it must be proved and debated and peer reviewed, which is not possible if you can't even get it to run and get the same results. The model is still subject to scientific inquiry, it can't be given a free pass.<p>Independent replication of results is also desirable, but you need both. In a world where nobody can replicate the results and it's hard to verify the simulation against the real world, it's too damned easy to end up with the Feynman electron mass situation where the selection effects from the researchers dominate the putative results of the simulations. The researcher summaries of the results of some runs of some models you can't see or execute and some data you can't get at happen to align... what does it mean? Frankly, who knows?",1264190828

I like the colors just the way they are, the blues, greens and grays, etc. I also like the female face with the headphones, I hope you own the image because it could be a strong brand image for you. She is very unique with the green eyes, green headphones and tattoos on her fingers and wrists.<p>2. I wonder, and probably others will wonder what those tattoos say or are, so maybe you could play it up a little and put something about it in your FAQ’s as a marketing angle to set your business off from the competition as hip, cool and unique. Think about what your target market would find memorable about this.<p>3. Some say they think the site is ugly, interestingly I do not think it is ugly, in fact I like it a lot. The fonts, colors, pics, etc., really seem to work for me. If you are shooting for a big time corporate look like some of Version’s or Sprints pages I think you have come pretty close, an 8.5 out of 10. I agree with some of the suggestions about having a designer look at it and suggest improvements, but if it were my site I would limit those changes to small customer tested iterations in layout vs. color and content.<p>4. My test of your site was if I were looking for a product of your type, based on this website would I personally trust the download enough to give it a try. My answer based on your website is 98% yes. Meaning if I were a potential customer I would download, set it up and give it a try, yes without a doubt I would. Then providing the product was a better than the competition I would keep it--sale made.  So as far as the site goes you could change it, pretty it up with different colors ect., but that might change my personal decision to download, but I am only one person and the site needs to be tested in live commerce still, so do iterate and test.<p>5. The <i>Features</i> page has a display problem on my big monitor with IE 7.0.5730.11. The four boxes on the right are lined up 50% on top of the text on the left. Also the text in the bottom box is displaying outside the bottom of the box.<p>A tip: If you’re using an x-y-z style of coding with layers or something similar, sometimes the older non-layer style (x-y) will be more cross browser compatible with less work.<p>6. If you are not already using banner ads, personally I think the site is good enough to spend banner ad promotion money on right now. If it were my site and ad money I would start a banner ad campaign right now if you think the product is ready to release to the public. Just iterate the site slowly with only very minor changes, and then test the changes on actual click through customers with an A-control site and a B-iterated site setup to see if the changes make any difference in amount of downloads between the two sites.<p>7. I would make the link to Green Ear more prominent and play it up a lot more. it will add gravitas to the product and possibly increase downloads.",1264190726

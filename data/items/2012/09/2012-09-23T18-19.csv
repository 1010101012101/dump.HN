The reason is that the deployment of the refactoring has the complexity of a new deployment, or even higher.<p>However, given that at large organizations updates and deployments can easily become political issues, it's a good habit to deploy often. That makes your life easier when trying to deploy new changes because those who are watching or performing the deployments get used to it - and the errors occuring during such deployments.",1348426757

4561712,comment,4561233,4561233,17,0,psykotic,,,"Daniel J. Bernstein has a nice survey paper covering all the major multidigit multiplication algorithms:<p><a href=""http://cr.yp.to/papers/m3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/papers/m3.pdf</a><p>What I like about it beyond the comprehensive coverage is that it explains the mathematical structure that underlies each of the algorithms. Unfortunately for HN readers, the paper's intended audience is mathematicians, but with a bit of background in algebra you might still be able to glean some useful insights.<p>As an example, I'll try to describe the Karatsuba trick.<p>We want to multiply two linear polynomials p = a + bx and q = c + dx. That is, we want to calculate the coefficients e, f, g in (a + bx)(c + dx) = e + fx + gx^2 in terms of a, b, c, d. The standard algorithm is e = ac, f = ad + bc, g = bd. This has 4 multiplications and 1 addition.<p>Here's the Karatsuba trick as usually presented. The word 'trick' is apt because this makes it seem like pulling a rabbit from a magician's hat. Let u = (a+b)(c+d) = ac + ad + bc + bd. Then f = u - ac - bd = u - e - g. Thus Karatsuba's trick calculates u = (a+b)(c+d), e = ac, g = bd, f = u-e-g. This has 3 multiplications and 4 additions. We've saved 1 multiplication at the expense of 3 extra additions.<p>If we now apply Karatsuba's trick recursively in divide-and-conquer fashion to the left and right halves of higher-degree polynomials, we get an algorithm that is faster than the standard algorithm even if we assume that scalar additions and multiplications have the same cost. The standard algorithm has cost O(n^2), where n is the degree of the polynomials, and Karatsuba's algorithm has cost O(n^(lg 3)), which is around O(n^1.6).<p>So what's the structure underlying Karatsuba's trick? Well, you might have noticed that u is p q evaluated at x = 1. You can evaluate a product of polynomials without multiplying them out first because evaluation is a homomorphism, so u = (p q)(1) = p(1) q(1).<p>Evaluation is a lossy (non-injective) mapping, so we will have to evaluate their product at three different points (since the product is quadratic and hence has three coefficients) to recover the original product uniquely. We've already evaluated at x = 1. Two other obvious candidate points for cheap evaluation are x = 0 and x = infinity. Evaluating at x = 0 just gives the constant term, so (p q)(0) = a c. Evaluating at x = infinity (make the substitution w = 1/x, clear denominators and evaluate at w = 0) gives the highest-degree term, so (p q)(infinity) = b d.<p>Now that we've evaluated the product at three points, all we have to do is interpolate between them with the Lagrange formula to recover the product.<p>That's the conceptual, geometric derivation of Karatsuba's trick.<p>This evaluate-and-interpolate approach is also what underlies FFT-based multiplication algorithms. The n-point FFT efficiently evaluates a polynomial at the nth roots of unity, which are the vertices of the regular n-gon on the unit circle in the complex plane. The inverse FFT efficiently interpolates an (n-1)-degree polynomial from its values at the nth roots of unity. The usual way of looking at FFT-based multiplication is via the convolution theorem (polynomial multiplication is convolution of the coefficient sequences). That may be more direct, but I like the unifying character of the evaluate-and-interpolate perspective.<p>Rather than use just evaluation, you can apply more general homomorphisms. That's how you get Toom's trick. If you've taken algebra, you'll recall that evaluation at a point t is just the quotient homomorphism for the maximal ideal (x - t).<p>If you find this intriguing, I suggest you study djb's paper.",1348426599

Can you push back when queue lengths get too high at some part of a multi-stage pipeline?

The thing about A-level people is they already know other A-level people who can make an intro in that city.

However ""taking it easy"" on a business trip is pretty crummy since you often don't know anybody.<p>Here's an idea - a service that is focused on frequent business travelers.

I only heard the talk that was made public along with this project that was posted here, and which was recommended as an information source, and pretty much serves as the web page and documentation for this project ;P.<p>> Again, not a Clojure expert, but a namespace is coarser-grained than individual local scopes, right? The problem I'm talking about is when you have a local variable inside a nested scope (e.g. inside a `let`). If this is not named by a namespace, then you would still get collisions.<p>Ok, so are you are concerned with the case where the person defining the macro uses a symbol from the namespace of the person using the macro but that symbol has been rebound by the user inside of a let surrounding the aforementioned usage of the macro?<p>If so, that requires a cyclic module dependency, which isn't allowed (as the namespace from which you are getting the symbol would need to be required, but it would have to require back to get access to the macro: it does eager name binding, so that can't happen).<p>If not, and you are just talking about the simpler and more obvious case of a let shadowing a binding inside of a larger scope used by a macro, that works fine. The following code prints ""1100"", despite the macro expanding to multiple uses of the same symbol ""t"".<p><pre><code>    (def t 1000) 
    (defmacro run [x] 
        `(+ ~x t))
    (let [t 100]

You might then wonder (as I have) whether this is implemented by simply renaming the variables bound by let to something random: that would be sufficient to implement this. However, if I go out of my way to unquote an unqualified symbol, I can capture: the following code prints ""1200"".<p><pre><code>    (def t 1000)

Linus created both his great successes (linux and git) after experience with similar systems (unix/minix and bitkeeper). Being able to play with an implementation, experience its strengths and weaknesses, gives you a concrete base to use, reason with, push against, and come up with new insights - it's enormously helpful in <i>seeing</i> the problem.<p>But that's a grand vision - I wonder if Linus is also talking about programming in the small, each step of the way, as a low-level pragmatic guide.

4561555,comment,4560691,4561516,1,0,dherman,,,"> Clojure does not have these issues: when the macro is called, the symbols are already attributed with the full namespace qualification, and usage of quasi-quote inside of the macro definition will also apply namespace qualification to variables local to the definition of the macro; you have to go out of your way to break this.<p>Again, not a Clojure expert, but a namespace is coarser-grained than individual local scopes, right? The problem I'm talking about is when you have a local variable inside a nested scope (e.g. inside a `let`). If this is not named by a namespace, then you would still get collisions.<p>Regardless, Clojure's approach seems to be much closer in spirit to a hygienic macro system: it attempts to get scoping correct by default, and allows you to intentionally capture.<p>> You should spend more time looking into it before claiming to people that it doesn't work correctly; you could easily have just said ""that's a good question, we'll look into that after the talk"" rather than telling the person that Clojure wasn't as good.<p>Fair enough as far as it goes. I did react snappily, but you didn't hear the offline conversation (this whole thing was a dialog at my office with a friend and colleague, incidentally) where I said ""I'm not entirely sure, but I believe there are things you just can't express with systems like Clojure's."" And we concluded, just as you reprimanded me to do, that we should look into it further when we have time.<p>Dave",1348423504

Good relationships with suppliers and competent execution of your strategy are paramount -- think Walmart.<p>(b) Competing on product means you have to be able to blow away your competition.  It's easier the smaller your niche is.  It's often about having a talented designer -- Steve Jobs, Shigeru Miyamoto, Notch -- together with a support team.<p>A lot of software is easier to compete on product, because (1) the zero-marginal-cost structure of the industry means that competing on price is a race to the bottom that will ultimately be won by open source, and (2) a lot of software is specialized.<p>Companies that win in (a) tend to be driven by business types who are good at the stuff they teach in MBA school.  Companies that win in (b) tend to be driven by creative types and have a culture where the creatives' vision is the core competency, and the business side is seen as more of a support role.  The good news for bootstrap-stage startups is, if you're in category (b), your business chops don't matter as much; the product can make up for a lot, if it's good enough.<p>So if your team is thin on business talent but has a ton of technical talent, you should use strategy (b).  The reverse should use strategy (a) in theory, but in practice is rare among startups; business types who are good at what they do tend to pull down very good compensation, and mostly hang around companies that can afford it.  Of course, if you're in YC or funded, you may have access to business-knowledgeable people; but getting to that point usually means you already have a great product and a lot of technical talent.",1348423280

I trust restaurant employees not to poison my food, but that doesn't mean I trust them with my SS number, bank account, and the details of my personal life. Pre 12.04, if Canonical wanted access to the personal information of their users, it would have involved putting in a backdoor that would be 1)detectable by all Ubuntu users 2)illegal under most spyware laws and 3)cause an extremely large backlash and wide mistrust of Canonical. So I 'trusted' Canonical not to engage in widespread criminal hacking which would have severe legal and social consequences. These consequences now seem removed: 1)There's no way to know if they are misusing the information that is now passed through their servers, barring someone on their end leaking something. 2)They don't appear to have made a legally binding promise about what they are actually doing with the data. Even if they did, the legal consequence of breaking it may be ambiguous. Just because I _did_ trust Canonical doesn't mean I trust them forever. Canonical's method of dumping an obviously intrusive function on users and then issuing a smarmy response that downplays genuine concerns shows that they are missing the social intelligence that would be required to even properly understand issues of privacy invasion, and I'm certainly looking to migrate elsewhere.",1348423239

That said, look at Amazon's Kindle which is radically cheaper now a few years later. I suspect not many people would buy it over the iPad if it weren't so cheap. That's a great advantage for Amazon for selling but I think it says a lot about Apple that it can charge such a premium for its product that really anyone else should be able to make from the same core components.<p>I was really struck by this phenomena when I asked the day of the iPhone 5 announcement if a co-founder (who isn't an apple fan boy) if he was going to buy the new iphone. He said yes. I asked if he had seen the price yet or read all the new specs. He replied no. How many companies can convince you to buy a product you haven't tried or heard the price for? I doubt anyone would say the same thing of Samsung or Amazon products. Apple definitely puts out the best product and experience if you measure it from that perspective.",1348423220

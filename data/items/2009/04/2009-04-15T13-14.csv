563442,comment,563246,563329,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"Yes, I agree completely.  The first part of my post was expressing why I found the question about approaching Earth misguided, irrelevant, or inappropriate.  Clearly the Nerd Rage is just about the inconsistency with the ""earlier"" episodes.<p>The comments about the physics also sparked a conversation about escape velocity here in the office.  It's easy to compute that orbital velocity at grazing altitude is about 8 km/s.  People confuse that with escape velocity, which is sqrt(2) faster, or about 11.3 km/s.<p>The <i>real</i> confusion arises in that a craft never needs to reach escape velocity to escape.  You can happily escape without ever travelling faster than 6km/hr - walking pace.<p>If this confuses you, it's fun to work out why. And how. And why NASA doesn't do that.  The sums are fairly easy, it's the conceptualisation that's hard.",1239803609

Exceptions abound. Consider that example of the mail-order wine business. Do you know how hard it was to start such a business in the days before FDR? There was a lot of ""regulatory interference"", personified by guys like ""Eliot Ness"". You couldn't start a wine business in the USA, full stop -- unless you kept it underground. That era also had a devastating effect on our brewing industry that took a generation to recover from.<p>One could also ask some of the people who run porn sites about the complex history of ""regulatory interference"" in their business.<p>And, as we now know all too well, there have been times when regulation of the financial industry was much more strict than it is today. That's not a simple history, either: Corporations and stock exchanges have existed since the 17th century, but their degree of regulation has changed in complicated ways over time.<p>And a relentless focus on taxes obscures other forms of interference that were more important at certain times, for certain industries. However onerous it is to start a telecom-based company today, it was probably harder back in those days before FDR, when AT&T held a government-sanctioned monopoly over all of US telephony:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Bell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma_Bell</a><p><i>In 1934, the government set AT&T up as a regulated monopoly under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission, in the Communications Act of 1934... by 1940 the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States, from local and long-distance service to the telephones themselves. This allowed Bell to prohibit their customers from connecting phones not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a type of phone not leased by the local Bell monopoly, he or she had to purchase the phone at cost, give it to the phone company, then pay a 're-wiring' charge and a monthly lease fee in order to use it.</i><p>That the Internet managed to come into existence at all is the result of a complex interplay of antitrust law, the rise of government-funded research under guys like Vannevar Bush, and the Cold War (DARPA, which funded the Internet, was born in the days after Sputnik).<p>Today, our cable and phone companies also wield virtual monopolies with the help of the FCC.

I can't see any examples of ideas historically that wouldn't have been made in the absence of a patent.  And to patent an idea rather than an implementation...<p>The exception would be investors stealing an idea they see and the solution would be contracts but I doubt investors would sign these.",1239800920

And the moderate of 50 years ago would be fringe today.  The moderate of 100 years ago would be a radical today.<p>Don't surrender your reason to social contructivism.",1239800911

Just like I wouldn't go and jump from a bridge to defy gravity I wouldn't say ""God doesn't exist"" to my mother, who is a fundamental Christian. I am not particularly scared of consequences of saying ""fuck you, pig"" to a policeman but I'm also not scared of banging my head against the wall. Yet, I don't see any particular reason why I should bang my head against the wall.<p>I like PG's essay ""Things you can't say"" since it describes me so perfectly. Inside my mind anything is allowed, even the most perverse and horrible fantasies -- ANYTHING. Yet, not much of this goes outside :)",1239800738

563374,comment,561731,561731,0,0,apoirier,,,"The python Nagare framework use both approaches of programmatic HTML
and minimalist HTML templating. For example, to create a HTML list,
in a div, from a Python list:<p><pre><code>  from nagare.namespaces import xhtml

  l = ['the', 'mandatory', 'hello', 'world']

  h = xhtml.Renderer()
  with h.div(id='content'):
      with h.ul:
          h << [h.li(element) for element in l]

  print h.root.write_htmlstring()
</code></pre>
Or a (X)HTML template can have nodes annotated with a 'meld:id=<id>'
attribut. They are then retreived and manipulated in Python.<p>In both cases, one of the main goal is not to reinvent a new
syntax / templating language but to use normal Python with all its power.
Also the generated (X)HTML is always well-formed.<p><a href=""http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki/PresentationTier"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nagare.org/trac/wiki/PresentationTier</a>",1239800681

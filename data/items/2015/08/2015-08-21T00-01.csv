Once a prosecutor has you in his sights your choices are to fight back, demand a trial, and have the prosecutor throw the book at you and ask for the maximum most extreme sentence, try to lock you in a cage for years to be repeatedly beaten and raped and destroy your ability to succeed in society for having the audacity to demand your rights, or accept the punishment the justice system has decided to dole out to you with a plea. So we trust prosecutors to only push cases they truly believe are just. But the promotion scheme for prosecutors is such that those prosecutors who believe any winnable case is a just one get the most convictions, and therefore the most power.<p>And consider juries; as a juror you are instructed (falsely) that you are required to judge a case simply on the facts and that you must leave your ability to be a human being and do moral reasoning at the door (hence, morality has no place in a courtroom -- the jurors, who decide the case, are explicitly told they may not use it), and lawyers are even legally prevented from informing the jurors of their rights.<p>I think you&#x27;re very right about the source of these problems -- they come from lawyers in so much as almost all of our legislators are lawyers, trained into this profession and having gone through all of this before they create laws. But it&#x27;s not the trial lawyers or judges who created these issues, and many of them get into the game in order to make things better. But I think to succeed in a system requires acceptance of the system; it changes you. I&#x27;ll concede that it&#x27;s likely there are many, many people in the legal profession for whom my analysis isn&#x27;t particularly accurate and I&#x27;m encouraged by your vigorous repudiation of my pessimism (I don&#x27;t want to be right), but I think there&#x27;s some truth there to what I&#x27;m saying. And I&#x27;m not suggesting that there is an easy solution; the problems are emergent, systemic, and very deep.",1440118671

10095397,comment,10093026,10095358,0,0,logicallee,,,"Well, I said you can only use technical knowledge.  If you really want to be anal about the analogy then the game is you can only <i>dictate</i> technical knowledge to someone in 1860 (or I guess show them diagrams, but only of technical things - you are not allowed to talk about anything else) and give them starting capital.  Then how well you do at the game depends on the ability of the person you picked to...execute.  (As well as understand the technical knowledge they&#x27;ve been dictated/shown)  It&#x27;s not hard to understand what I&#x27;m getting at.  But if you pick someone who can&#x27;t understand the ideas, you won&#x27;t do well at the revised game.<p>Why this is a workable analogy is because this really is similar to the position that founders with technical ideas are in.  They have this vision that something can more or less work - <i>but even if it does</i> they still have to execute on it.  That&#x27;s my point.<p>Everything you dictate in this revised game is 100% guaranteed to work, because you&#x27;re reading it straight out of technical manuals for the scientists who build these things today.  But that still doesn&#x27;t make a company that manufacture these things pop out of thin air.  You can transfer a very large part of a $1 trillion in R&D back in time -- the ideas; but you won&#x27;t suddenly have a company as a result.  Someone still has to make it all and sell it all.<p>As an example, even if Babbage had invented modern transistors, he didn&#x27;t &quot;almost&quot; create Intel and IBM.

Especially if both universes started at around the same time.<p>But then I guess that would probably mess up orbits of smaller things. Although space is big so maybe not. Just a thought.",1440117097

The reason that those stories exist is that the information was leaked.<p>Those leaks were almost certainly Google&#x27;s fault. Either Google leaked the information themselves, or they leaked it indirectly.  If we read the enforcement notice, it claims that Google at first complied with the order to de-index the web site which published that person&#x27;s criminal record, but Google <i>also notified that website owner</i>. In other words, they tipped off the owner, which can be regarded as a form of defiance of the court order: agreeing to the letter of the order (performing the delisting) but not to the spirit (earnestly helping to bury that person&#x27;s past).<p>So that might be the source of the leak; maybe the website owner&#x27;s feathers were ruffled, and they reacted by gleefully leaking the story to the media.  Such a reaction is so predictable that it&#x27;s likely Google tipped off that website owner <i>on purpose</i> in order to generate the leak. Knowing that the leak will reveal details about that person, and knowing that the Google index will in turn pick up the stories resulting from the leak.  Also knowing that they could refuse to delist those stories on grounds that they are are noteworthy stories of recent interest, representing the journalistic judgment of their respective news organizations that Google has no reason to second-guess.<p>Google should have removed that index entry <i>quietly</i>, without notifying the website owner. Then the removal could easily have gone unnoticed and there might now not be any  stories mentioning that person.<p>They are now simply being asked to mop up the leak that they caused.<p>Whether or not you agree with this &quot;right to be forgotten&quot; business, you have to agree that particular twist in the plot isn&#x27;t any <i>dumber</i>.

when 1
   name = &quot;Coffee&quot;
   price = @items[:coffee]
... #end of case statement<p>vend(name, price).<p>That&#x27;ll DRY up your code at least a little bit.",1440115358

Creating your own such organization, on the other hand, usually isn&#x27;t unless you&#x27;re a very large project (on par with LLVM, Apache, etc).<p>Instead, consider joining one of the several umbrella organizations that support FOSS projects (including managing donations and legal issues), such as Software Freedom Conservancy (which covers projects like Git, Mercurial, QEMU, Samba, Boost, Inkscape, and PyPy), or Software in the Public Interest (which covers Debian, PostgreSQL, ffmpeg, LibreOffice, MinGW, Arch, freedesktop.org, and others).",1440115331

Even though they talk about &quot;airlines&quot;, the stats are really just for &quot;scheduled air services&quot; as far as I can tell. Indonesia has a huge number of scheduled air taxi services compared to countries like the USA, Canada or Europe. So it would be more fair to compare the stats with the air taxi operators in rich countries, which have a much poorer safety record. There&#x27;s a big difference between landing a two-crew 737 on a 2 mile runway with a Cat III ILS and SOPs, and a 250 hour wonder landing a bush plane on the side of a mountain.<p>Look up &quot;worst place to be a pilot&quot; on youtube.",1440115247
10095296,comment,10091454,10095036,0,0,javajosh,,,"Ah, okay, well that example makes it clearer. It wasn&#x27;t clear from your example (or from my local test) where you just show this:<p><pre><code>   class Todo
	# variable defined in class scope
	var count = 0
</code></pre>
Which compiles into this:<p><pre><code>   var count = 0;
</code></pre>
And also your example page elides the IIFE that your compiler surrounds all output with, implying (falsely) that it&#x27;s global.<p>As for ST, I think that for me based on my brief experience, you might want to add more compiler warnings to the watcher. (Basically I messed with Imba locally with two ST windows side-by-side, looking at Imba on the left and js on the right, treating the watcher output as compiler output.) Don&#x27;t get me wrong, ST feedback is great, but the watcher feels more canonical. Besides, not everyone has ST!",1440115226

The reporting party should feel guilty about not putting effort into providing system information and troubleshooting further and reporting their findings. This is exactly why Stack Overflow works so well: low quality questions are downvoted mercilessly, and closed if they aren&#x27;t improved within a short time period. It is also why automated reporting tools provide a good amount of contextual information along with the error and stack trace.<p>Furthermore, not including a description of the issue along with the stack trace makes it impossible for other users to determine if they are experiencing the same issue or something else (since it is possible for two different bugs to produce the same stack trace, or even the same error message).",1440115214

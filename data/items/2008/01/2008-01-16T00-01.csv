Not even their shared hosting plan is what they claim it is... they shut down mine after ONE blog post became popular and started receiving a lot of hits.<p>Just stay away.",1200444661

98975,comment,98757,98799,0,0,vitaminj,,,"I'm not certain that Paulson could have afforded the losses if the market kept booming, so you're likely right about the six months earlier or later.<p>However in principle, this is exactly how Nassim Taleb (the Black Swan author) made his money during the 1987 wall street crash (iirc). At the time, people were selling options that hedged against large falls in price very cheaply. Taleb bought loads of them and profited hugely as a result of the crash.<p>Paulson's scheme was a little more complicated, but the formula was essentially the same - underpriced hedging instruments + crash = massive profit.<p>This quote from the article sums it up perfectly:
<i>Mr. Paulson became convinced investors were far underestimating the risk in the mortgage market. In betting on it to crumble, ""I've never been involved in a trade that had such unlimited upside with a very limited downside,"" he says.</i>",1200442840

98973,comment,98757,98896,0,0,vitaminj,,,"True in general, but when he bought them, they were priced very low. Even after he bought millions (presumably) of the swaps, other investors thought he was an idiot and didn't follow suit, so the price of the swaps probably didn't go up much. It was only after the sub-prime fiasco got into third gear that other investors began clamouring for the swaps.<p>By all rights, his initial foray into buying the swaps most likely had minimal effect on the price. Ultimately he felt they were incorrectly priced by the market and made a bet on them.",1200442065

They could also throw in a few random free movies, too.  And since the sticks are ordered en masse, they'd probably pay for themselves within a short amount of time.  It's something Blockbuster could try to stay in the game, at least.",1200441787

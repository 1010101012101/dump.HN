This translates to, ""Don't risk what you have"".<p>And therein lies a problem, if I have little but can't risk it then I'm risk averse and cannot gamble on high risk opportunities. I desperately want to do a start-up and to do something new, but what could possibly encourage me to risk what I now have, I've earned a normal life and I have no plan B were I to jeopardise it.<p>So I fight to never go back, which isn't the same as fighting to get somewhere in the future.<p>The real achievement, if I ever manage it, will be to get out of that predicament and to be free to take risk without fearing too greatly the repercussions. I probably won't ever be back on the street, but it's very hard to shake the fear of it. If someone else's tale can tell me how to do that I'd be grateful.",1268920674

1201269,comment,1201062,1201240,0,0,m0nty,,,"""Should I have a more positive outlook?""<p>Yes, I believe you should and I apologise if I came off a bit snippy. The campaign I was involved with (the PCG, opposing IR35) was ultimately unsuccessful in parliament but won some victories on a case-by-case basis and ultimately made a significant difference to people's lives. In my own case, the Inland Revenue tried to over-tax me but were forced to drop the case because of what the PCG did. Did I feel pleased about that? I think so, yes.<p>I also wrote letters about the RIP Act when that was going through parliament. I wrote to (and met with) my MP, Mark Oaten, who seemed like a thoroughly decent and intelligent man who grokked the issues immediately. I also wrote to Jack Straw, Tony Blair and (because she was saying the right things) Anne Widdecombe, even though I suspect she is in all other respects quite barmy. Of course, they ignored me, afaik.<p>What I think did make a difference was a casual conversation with an acquaintance who turned out to be the Conservative front-bench spokesman in the Lords for Trade and Industry (Francis Lord Northbrook if you're interested). He asked me to write a briefing paper, which I did -- a couple of sides of A4 saying what was wrong with the legislation. He used it as a basis for his response to the RIP Bill, as it was at that time. OK, it shouldn't come down to personal acquaintance but it sometimes does, and if I hadn't written all those futile letters we would never have had the conversation which prompted his request to me.<p>Now to my point: if the situation is really that desperate why even post the article? Just STFU and continue to let them rip you, me and everyone else off. Or you could, you know, <i>engage</i> with the flawed people in this flawed situation and possibly, I don't know, do something to make a difference. Win or lose, I'd rather participate than sit and whine about things.<p>""What did you do during the Internet Wars daddy?""",1268920626

A teacher is giving a mathematics lesson, and he gives the students a problem: ""Prove that such-and-such is so-and-so. Any questions?"" One of the students raises his hand. ""Sir, what is a proof? How do we know whether a proof is any good or not?""<p>It turns out that although the idea of a proof is relatively easy to grok and to use, proving whether something is a proof or not is extraordinarily difficult. The story comes to mind for two reasons: First, because ""intellectual curiosity"" is like ""proof,"" easy to grok but difficult to define precisely. And second, because now you've piqued my intellectual curiosity: Is it possible to write a program that does a good job of flagging off-topic stories?",1268918839

1201189,comment,1200832,1200832,0,0,lutorm,,,"It seems to me this is how capitalism works. Those that say a free market economy maximizes choice I think are out to lunch. If you want exactly the same thing that everyone else does, then yes there are tons of choices (e.g. 50 different types of toothpaste in the store), but if you want something that's even a little out of the mainstream, forget it. Try finding <i>electronics</i> at an electronics store, where by electronics I mean something that isn't a shrinkwrapped gadget, like a breadboard, for example.<p>Another personal story: I have fairly small feet, where by small I mean 39-40 in European size, which by no means is abnormally small. Finding shoes for me is a frustrating exercise because most stores don't carry sizes that small. And the thing is that <i>every store</i> stops at the same size, so if you don't find it in the first store it's highly unlikely that going to ten more stores will help.<p>It seems to me that what the article is describing is exactly what happens: everyone rushes to the largest market with the largest potential and, while <i>in theory</i> there should be someone establishing themselves in the smaller markets, when deciding whether they want to be a big fish in a small pond or a small fish in a big pond, they go with the latter.<p>It's like when you get to a fraction of the total market (defined in some way) and it's below 5% or something, it's not like only 5% of the actors in the market will offer something for you. Everyone makes the same decision so the selection quickly drops to zero.<p>Thing came out longer than I expected, sorry for rambling.",1268918659

1201162,comment,1200959,1201136,0,0,buro9,,,"Rough family, poverty. I grew up in council housing in West London, there was physical violence and there was crime everywhere around. I put myself on the streets to get myself away from the immediate physical danger and to prevent myself from continuing the vicious cycle of being nurtured in crime having that define my own life.<p>Whilst on the streets I hitch-hiked around, and as I did so I discovered that you slept during the day and kept your wits about you at night. It's too cold some nights to sleep out, so then you move. Or crawl into a building site where others wouldn't go and you'd be safe and mostly sheltered.<p>I eventually found that not being on the street at night was better than being on the street, since I was young I went to bars that had gigs. You could get in early before the gig started, so entrance was free. And then stay post-gig as a club would run until 3am at least. Some nights you'd meet students who would take an interest in the story and let you crash at theirs. Which is a free toast top-up and shower opportunity. I developed confidence from having to find these opportunities.<p>With the gigs settling in I would meet bands, and then they'd know me and give me free food from their riders. Eventually I knew a lot of the bands and I offered to run their T-Shirt stalls. This earned me money too.<p>Knowing the bands gave me exposure to them, so I wrote fanzines and sold those. You'd sell more fanzines if the band who were playing were on the cover... so I'd make only the insides, and produce covers according to who was playing.<p>Elastica took a shine to me so I followed them around, helped design their merchandise, run their paper mailing lists and sold T-Shirts. This led to the stock management thing, they purchased me an IBM computer which I put in the squat I then was living in. I built a program to manage their stock, then their mailing list, then tax reports of merchandise sold, etc.<p>Finally I ran into another band who I liked, and I offered all of the services I now knew how to do. The sales of merchandise, running of fan club, etc. They said yes, and I did that stuff and also acquired a modem (it was 1996 now). I taught myself HTML and PERL and made a website too.<p>Within 2 years I'd gone from the streets to employment in the music industry where programming was a core part of my job alongside selling merchandise. Later I worked directly for the label and by this time was off the streets properly with a flat-share with a girl I'd met in the music industry.<p>It makes a great tale, but not all of it was easy. Hunger was frequent, illness almost as frequent, cold nights scar your memory. I slept in some bad places at times, and other times managed to blag my way into some swanky places. It was ups and downs, but all of it was better than returning to the place where I had grown up. And the driving force in my life is to ensure that I never return to the place I came from, and to never go back to the streets. It's a hell of a motivator.",1268918108

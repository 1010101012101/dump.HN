But regardless, tomorrow, for &quot;research purposes&quot;, we are going to take a run at seeing how far we can penetrate the system. Any ideas on some things we should try out. I&#x27;ll tell you that we are running java on a weblogic server.<p>Things we&#x27;ve already planned include:
Mapping out the network

Here&#x27;s one he recommends as an intro to the capabilities and philosophy of Erlang: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41GEwIq2mE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u41GEwIq2mE</a><p>The entire Erlang thesis falls out of one simple fact: for a program to be highly available, it must run on more than on piece of hardware.<p>When you run on more than one piece of hardware, you need to be able to communicate between pieces of hardware, detect failures, and when something fails you need to be able to restart it (hacks: systemd, SMF) or reassign responsibility to a different piece of hardware that hasn&#x27;t failed yet.<p>Monitoring and restarting in itself isn&#x27;t simple.  What if what you&#x27;re monitoring is on another physical machine?  You need built in networking and for simplicity, you need built in location transparency.  If I start process Bob on machine A and process Kat on machine B, I should be able to interact with Bob on either machine <i>without</i> specifying where it&#x27;s running (i.e. RMI that works).<p>And all of this is the Erlang VM so far—nothing to do with the language itself.  The language adds nice features like pattern matching and atoms and tuples and cons cells and binaries and bignums, but those features are independent of the &quot;Erlang-ness&quot; of the runtime.<p>There are a lot of great articles written about rationales behind all these topics and a lot of great talks up on YouTube.  Just search YouTube for Joe Armstrong talks and/or general Erlang intro talks.  You&#x27;ll soon see how the basics of Erlang are being re-implemented in 2015, except half thought through, and it&#x27;ll take another 10 years for these ad-hoc remade components to become &quot;I&#x27;d bet the farm on it&quot; reliable.",1438907441

Off the top of my head I can only think of 1 or 2 quality anime doujinshi that were subbed - making it a worse example for &quot;for-free artists&quot;. Many doujinshi will hand out free copies of their manga though when starting out, to gain popularity. Even if it is initially a loss for them.<p>For anime, it&#x27;s produced for-profit, that&#x27;s correct, but piracy arguably <i>helps</i> their for-profit motives more than it harms them. If they spent a bunch of money, time, and effort preventing all piracy of their IP - they&#x27;d lose out on countless international sales of merchandise... and for what exactly? Because they own the IP? That&#x27;s nice. As long as it&#x27;s profitable for them, why should they care? This is why Comiket is tolerated.<p>It&#x27;s costly to sub an anime for a foreign release where it isn&#x27;t guaranteed to do as well as it did in Japan. Often times unpopular anime from Japan is very popular overseas, so it can be difficult even choosing what to release overseas. They&#x27;re essentially getting free labor from fansub groups which results in sales they would have had to pay for (by releasing their own sub/dub). That&#x27;s a win-win for the studio.<p>This is less applicable to Hollywood movies that lack merchandise deals (e.g. anything that isn&#x27;t superhero related) and music. I&#x27;m aware of that, but each form of media has its own arguments.<p>Over 1/2 of my music library was purchased <i>only</i> because I originally heard of the artist because a friend pirated their music or I was listening to their music <i>for free</i> (I use AdBlock, so they aren&#x27;t making money off ads) on YouTube. I would not have discovered the artist or purchased their music without this method of discovery, which is reliant on my friends or other people pirating their music and &quot;broadcasting it&quot; to the world.<p>So it becomes an issue of &quot;if 1 pirate results in greater than or equal to 2 sales, it is profitable to let the pirate pirate&quot; and measuring (and quantifying) the pirates &quot;free marketing&quot; aspect. While I can personally quantify which items my friends have pirated and determine whether it was, in the end, profitable for the company to let them pirate or not.<p>The company has no way of measuring what sales of their sales occurred because of pirates. They only know that piracy means they &quot;lost a sale&quot;; which might not have happened even if piracy wasn&#x27;t an option. This is where the problem lies and opinions differ.<p>I&#x27;m of the opinion that the free publicity piracy provides outweighs the lost sales that occur from piracy, therefore tolerating, <i>but not promoting</i>, piracy is an overall net gain.<p>This argument is different than one I would use for a painter or photographer. Where stealing is a lot more harmful to the artist, especially since attribution is almost never given for stolen works. In this form of media, piracy <i>steals</i> recognition and publicity rather than <i>giving it</i>. That&#x27;s actively harmful and is more easily provable that it harms the artist.",1438907379

Yes, that is the ideal, but the real world intrudes.<p>I did hang out with my kids while they used the internet. We did have the discussions about safe and unsafe behaviour.

They know if anything they come across on the internet makes them uncomfortable they can come to me and not get in trouble. They have done this often as they were starting out. We kept the kids computer out in the family room, in the public family space and not in their bedroom where it is unsupervised. I’ve put in that hard work.<p>But you know what? I can’t be with then every minute they are on the internet. They have phones and laptops for school now. The internet is used ubiquitously in our house. They’re teenagers now, and I am not a helicopter that can hover over them.

I don’t have to rely on my imperfect supervision and my mercurial mood to yell at them to get off the computer.<p>When the proxy logs show one of my kids was starting to search for porn, I was able to have the discussion with them on about how pornography is entertainment, not educational, and when you are sexually inexperienced it can really give you wrong ideas of what sex and intimacy is like, and screw up your expectations. It helped me to give my kid timely education, not catch them and be able to go “Ah HA!”

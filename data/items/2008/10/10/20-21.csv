Once they couldn't necessarily count on their rising stock price to act as part of their employee's compensation they started to raise salaries to help make up the difference.",1223672220

Can I unclick a star?  I may have misclicked.<p>There should be some indication that the large box in the middle of the page is loading something when you first go there.

The criteria I mentioned would just be the start of the search -- you should easily come up with scads of stocks that meet that criteria. There are a lot of steps after that.<p>Going to an index is usually a safe bet. I think it still is. But that's long term. You could end up waiting ten years just to double your money. I'm just talking about a quick hit. Now you could combine the approach and go with an sector index.

While a good AI would engender a positive emotional attachment, a truly intelligent bad AI would attempt to do the same; good and bad AIs are effectively indistinguishable until they get out.

If the limitations of the web platform are taken into account from the beginning when writing multi-platform C or C++ code, and one doesn&#x27;t go crazy with C++ templates, it actually is not too bad. Porting a huge existing code base with many external dependencies is quite another topic.<p>I found the performance of asm.js in current JS engines the least limiting factor, instead it&#x27;s the higher level APIs like WebGL, WebAudio that become the limiting factor.<p>Also, existing (game development) middleware hardly focused on reducing code bloat so far, which then results in huge Javascript blobs (but also huge native executables).<p>I&#x27;ve started a little while ago writing a low-level C++ engine from scratch with all of this taken into account (here: <a href=""http://floooh.github.io/oryol/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://floooh.github.io/oryol/</a>) where the size of the Javascript blob is (roughly) in the same ballpark as a three.js demo (minified and compressed three.js is around 100kByte, Oryol 3D samples start around 90 kByte.<p>So basically: asm.js and WebAssembly yay, HTML5 APIs nay :)",1452952395

I still loved (and love) the OS, but already in &#x27;95 it was on borrowed time and it cost a fortune to tack on enough third party add ons to make it viable. And the lack of software was becoming a problem - a colleague and I even spoke o Escom at the time about writing a browser for them, because the available Amiga web browsers were already then lagging behind he times.<p>And in &#x27;95 people <i>did</i> care about the &quot;remote networking case no one cares about&quot;. At university, we also had old Sun servers that served up apps for dozens of dumb X11 terminals each.

Are we talking about fully thread-safe or only being reentrant?<p>For the most part, being reentrant is sufficient -- i think there are few cases where it makes sense to be really thread-safe (i.e., lock mutexes on every access as opposed to let the client do the locking as needed) since that forbids composability.<p>Making a function reentrant is mostly <i>very</i> easy.

The prior state of the art, Grisu3 (2010), is great but is only fast for 99.5% of inputs; it was nevertheless so useful that there are now several language implementations with Grisu3 (IIRC, including V8, SpiderMonkey, Go, Julia and Rust). The new algorithm, Errol3, improves Grisu3 by using double-double floating point format (instead of 64-bit custom FP) and applying more precise error analysis.<p>Quoting the highlight of the paper: (emphases original)<p>> After removing the narrowing and widening steps, we used the enumeration algorithm to generate a list of <i>possibly</i> incorrect or suboptimal inputs. Each input was run using Errol2 to enumerate a <i>complete</i> list of inputs that do not generate correct and optimal outputs. In total, we found that only 45 inputs (of the nearly 2^64 inputs) generate incorrect or suboptimal results; all other inputs are guaranteed to generete correct and optimal output. In order to correctly and optimally handle the failing inputs, they are hard-coded into a lookup table that maps the failing inputs to correct and optimal outputs. Combining the special handling of integers and this lookup table, Errol3 is guaranteed to be <i>correct and optimal without runtime checks</i>.",1452950042

In effect, this statement invites micro-management.  Interestingly enough, the author knows this approach is problematic, because they say immediately after, &quot;Again, the default of the Approver should be to monitor the decision process, not result.&quot;<p>Alternatively, a Vision/Retrospective process might work better, where by the Owner&#x27;s manager (the business structure) provides the higher-level vision and then looks at the Owner&#x27;s decisions and executions in retrospective.

If Facebook is worth $100 billion and Instagram poses a 1.1% threat to the value of the company then it's worth it to pay $1 billion to take them out. In particular Instagram being bought by twitter probably poses much more risk to Facebook than $1 billion. Twitter wasn't in a position to buy them for $1 billion in stock so Twitter loses out. I have a feeling that even a year or two from now buying Instagram is going to look like a very smart play, in 10 years it might just look genius.<p>Remember that Yahoo had the opportunity to buy Google for $1 million and turned it down. Given that Instagram added 10 million users on the news of acquisition it seems fairly sane.<p>Thus with those figures in hand it's easy to paint a picture where the board acted with fiduciary duty in the interests of shareholders.

3849902,comment,3849136,3849136,1,0,corford,,,"I have a bit of a problem accepting one of the arguments in this article (under the heading ""Is There a Bubble?"").<p>The author seems to be arguing that if you look at the actual and projected growth rate for both Instagram and OMGPOP (measured in number of account signups) as a percentage of the userbase of their suitors (i.e. Facebook and Zynga respectively), then the money paid for these companies represents ""EXCELLENT"" value.<p>To me that is an absolute fallacy. OMGPOP was going for 6 odd years and almost out of cash before they stumbled upon something that worked. Draw Something caught on like wildfire but the buzz will eventually die. What comes after it? i.e. how does past performance guarantee future performance (especially given the majority of past performance wasn't great)?<p>Similarly, Instagram has caught on like wildfire but even the CEO admitted that they have no way to monetize the user interest. So what we have is a freebie product that people love to use to send photos and an accompanying strap line of text. Yes it's cool but it isn't curing cancer and the users are using it as a fun throwaway service. They have no loyalty to Instagram and would drop it in a heartbeat if a charge was attached to using it.<p>So, where is the inherent ""value"" in all of these user accounts & signups? Having millions of user's doesn't automatically translate to a long term money printing machine like Apple or Google.<p>You can apply this argument to Zynga and Facebook themselves. Facebook has 800 million users but its total yearly revenue is half of Google's annual profits (according the wikipedia entries). Zynga IPO'd at $10 a share. Almost 6 months later and the share price hasn't moved. That doesn't look like explosive growth to me.<p>Given all of the above it really does feel like a bubble (at least to me). All the valuations seem to be based on a house of cards...<p>P.S.

Coming from Baltimore to DC, I was pulled over and given a citation for 67 in a 55 or something similar.<p>VASCAR is a method that is used with a stopwatch and a simple computer that divides distance travelled by the elapsed time. To avoid too much error, markings on the pavement are usually fixed and marked at a tenth of a mile or a quarter of a mile interval. In this case, they were using the time at which the car left the shadow of a bridge, to two traffic cones on the side of the road on an uphill stretch of I-95 - <a href=""http://g.co/maps/x6az8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://g.co/maps/x6az8</a><p>When I got the ticket, I asked two things - how did you know how fast I was going and when did you set up? He answered that they had started writing tickets around 9:45 that morning and the ticket was issued at 2:15 in the afternoon. Instantly, I formed my alibi.<p>Since we knew that the lines on the street weren't painted, we knew that the sun travelling across the sky would alter the point at which the car came out of the shadow, and, we were using two traffic cones on the side of the road that didn't cast much of a shadow to judge the position of the car. I forget the math based on the time that they measured it, but, it was something on the order of 12-18mph error based on the angle of the sun, time of the year and their setup time versus when I was stopped. I had pictures, a handout showing the math used referencing geometry books with footnotes explaining the sun's positional changes, the distance that the shadow would have moved over that time period, the increasing error throughout the day.<p>The officer stated that his VASCAR computer had been calibrated and he was a certified operator and all of my math was just mumbo-jumbo. They took a five minute recess - unheard of in traffic court - came back, and issued a not guilty on my case. The judge then asked if anyone else there had received tickets on that date from any of the six or seven officers that had issued tickets, and about 25 people raised their hands - all having their tickets dropped.<p>In point of fact, he probably was within 3mph of my actual speed as all of my measurements had been done based on a 1/10th of a mile rather than the quarter mile that they had used that day, but, there were a lot of happy people that day.

In addition to ""taste"" there is also Taste. A number of the hallmarks of Taste in instrumental music, like the ability to use slight modulation of rhythm to convey the visceral feeling of specific dance steps, are demonstrably cross cultural and enduring across generations. Many of the hallmarks of Taste in visual design (rule of thirds) have endured over hundreds of years. Note that these examples are rooted in the function of the human sensorium -- that's not coincidence.<p>This isn't to say that absolutely everything Louis Armstrong's contemporaries did still resonates today. It also isn't to say that absolutely everything the old masters painted resonates with 21st century viewers. But note how much of what Louis Armstrong and Michaelangelo did which still resonates and which contemporary artists still include in their practice. We now know from science that people are not ""blank slates."" This notion was just an ideological fiction. Our senses and perceptions mostly work in a particular way, and this is bound to give rise to Taste.<p>That said, you are mostly right, and our functioning as social animals with the ability to maintain ideologies as a group bonding mechanism also gives rise to ""taste.""<p><i>Taste is almost negligible.</i><p>If by this, you mean that the ratio of Taste/""taste"" is frustratingly close to zero, I'd say you're right.

I think I could be equally productive as a programmer on 20 hours a week, since I spend a lot of time on the web and generally doing things that we programmers do when we need to give our minds a break. I really don't think anybody can actually do 40 hours of programming a week.<p>I'm going to lazily posit the law has something to do with it. I had my own business for a while, but never really made enough money at it (I'm a lousy entrepreneur). Even if I weren't making more money for about the same time investment, I might have fled from business ownership simply because I didn't like having nightmares that I did the taxes wrongand I never had an employee. It's probably as hard and as expensive tax-wise to hire someone for 20 hours a week as 40 and probably a lot harder for more than 40.<p>Another possibility is that it's just what happens in our society.<p>These answers don't feel all that satisfying to me.",1334615346

There's an identifiable difference between a flight on Virgin America and one on American Airlines, so at least some of the competition occurs on a dimension other than price.<p>There's a model called 'Porter's five forces' that is often used to evaluate the strength of business models, and Thiel's choice of language seems to indicate that he's familiar with and supports at least some aspects of this model.  It looks at five major factors:<p>1) threat of new competition (new airlines)
2) threat of substitutes (WebEx, high-speed rail)
3) bargaining power of buyers (you and me)
4) bargaining power of suppliers (Airbus, Sysco Foods, Airports, Labor, Fuel)
5) Intensity of competition<p>Thinking quickly about airlines, my thought is that items 2 and 5 are the largest problem areas.  Item 2 because if prices rise too much, businesses can shift some travel to email/webex/conference call, and pleasure travelers can pick alternate destinations either on lower-priced (likely less profitable) routes, or can simply not fly to their destination.<p>Item 5 because if A creates a profitable flight, there's a fairly strong incentive for B to start offering a very similar flight and competing (in part) on price.  This is likely to eventually drive the profit generated from that flight down to zero.  After all, even if A and B managed to reach a profitable equilibrium, C is likely to notice and compete on that flight, and this is likely to continue until everyone's revenues are just meeting their expenses.",1334615306

A human has a much wider range of movement, though, and I believe we better maintain force under movement.

This cult of collecting users as trophies or even faking them is both damaging to brands and user-hostile; in the long term it will fail and LinkedIn already has trust issues.<p><i>The g+ post just displays OP&#x27;s confusion at &quot;connect&quot; really meaning &quot;invite&quot; in instances where contacts don&#x27;t have a LinkedIn account.</i><p>The LinkedIn page is deliberately deceptive (showing a dead person as a member who can be added to someone&#x27;s network), in an attempt to goose their stats and get more signups. There&#x27;s no confusion here, and I&#x27;m surprised that you&#x27;d try to characterise it as that, deception might be a better word. If it means invite, it should say invite, and it should be presented as sending an email to a harvested contact, not inviting an already current LinkedIn member. This kind of <i>dark pattern</i> is where you end up if you trust certain metrics blindly and always make the modification which incrementally increases your metric (say user signups), regardless of other consequences.

There is also evidence showing that creativity comes easier during play time, not work time.<p>Nevertheless, I worked long(er) hours until I was about 28, and also at 31 because of my startup. The bottom line, for me, is that you end up missing out on life; unless there&#x27;s nothing in your life but work, of course, and that, for me, is quite sad.

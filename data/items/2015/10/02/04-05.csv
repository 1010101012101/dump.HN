If that is so, it is a solved problem :)<p>Basically, implementations log the error to the console and raise the PotentiallyUnhandledRejection event if an error occurs inside a promise and no .catch handler was attached. If a .catch handler is attached _after_ the error is already logged, then a RejectionHandled event is raised.

My girlfriend back then said that I had told her: &quot;There&#x27;s this undergrad at school who is the smartest person I&#x27;ve ever met.&quot;<p>That semester, Gates was fascinated with a math problem called pancake sorting: How can you sort a list of numbers, say 3-4-2-1-5, by flipping prefixes of the list? You can flip the first two numbers to get 4-3-2-1-5, and the first four to finish it off: 1-2-3-4-5. Just two flips. But for a list of n numbers, nobody knew how to do it with fewer than 2n flips. Bill came to me with an idea for doing it with only 1.67n flips. We proved his algorithm correct, and we proved a lower bound—it cannot be done faster than 1.06n flips. We held the record in pancake sorting for decades. It was a silly problem back then, but it became important, because human chromosomes mutate this way.<p>Two years later, I called to tell him our paper had been accepted to a fine math journal. He sounded eminently disinterested. He had moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico to run a small company writing code for microprocessors, of all things. I remember thinking: &quot;Such a brilliant kid.

People are afraid.  Think about every person who has a family member in an Oregon college; think how they felt when they heard, &quot;A mass shooting at an Oregon college has led to 10 people&#x27;s deaths&quot;.<p>The minimizing the impact, the &quot;let&#x27;s focus on heart disease not guns&quot; are ridiculous deflections, but hey, if you want to go down that path, lets do it.

In that same amount of time, 2.6k deaths were caused by terrorism.<p>So, let&#x27;s stop fighting terrorism and start taking care of gun violence.  It&#x27;s much scarier than terrorism, right?  I mean, terrorism is much, much rarer than gun violence.  Why are people scared of it? If they are,&quot;the solution is either education, psychotherapy or both&quot;.<p>Even though they are rare, we don&#x27;t ignore shark attacks.  We try to prevent them.  We study why sharks sometimes attack people.  Why don&#x27;t we do that for gun violence?<p>The right answer is to spend a little money on looking into why we have so many mass shootings.  We need to let the CDC study gun violence.  Let&#x27;s do some research and see if there is something we can do.<p>It&#x27;s time to stop shrugging our shoulders, like the article writer did, and try something.

There are many more, of course - but IMHO, crossing these two steps takes you past the tipping point.<p>For example - &#x27;%&#x27; matches parentheses and braces. So if you want to delete a block of code, you could go to the opening (or closing) brace, and do &quot;d%&quot;. If you wanted to indent only that block of code, you&#x27;d do &quot;=%&quot;. In this context, &quot;:help motion.txt&quot; makes for a good read.<p>Apart from this, I&#x27;d also recommend listing down things about your current workflow that you find irritating, and trying to find solutions for them in vim.<p>For instance - I wanted to be able to browse through cscope matches in a regular vim buffer than the ridiculous less-like interface that&#x27;s the default. I found quickfix, which solved my problem neatly. I then wanted to open each match in a vertical split, rather than in the same window - I ended up writing a little bit of vimscript and a keybinding for this.<p>Sometimes, when going through a gazillion cscope matches, I find it convenient to hide stuff that isn&#x27;t relevant - I use (manual) folds for this purpose.",1443759718

But I'm not sure if you're capable of being VPE but are being passed over because the CEO wants to bring in a buddy or because you are genuinely extremely unsuited for the job.<p>If you don't want to be marginalized, fight to get the VPE position. If you're going to get fired or further marginalized for fighting, you might as well learn now so that you'll win next time. If you get VPE, learn the skills required to be a great VPE and prove him wrong. Ask point blank for the position and find out why the CEO thinks you're unsuitable for VPE.<p>For some reason suits think management is not learnable/teachable. You sound smart; it's quite possible you'll be able to learn the required skills.<p>IMHO, people who think management is about ""people skills"" and ""politics"" are the clueless ones. Read up ""High Output Management"" by Andy Grove, a hard-core geek if ever there was one. He turned out to be an amazing manager too. Bill Gates, even harder-core nerd also turned out be an amazing manager.<p>To my mind, management is more similar to programming than to party planning (where people skills are really required). The manager's job is to set up systems and processes which will result in maximum output. To do this, you need to be analytical, quantitative, data-driven, open to being proven wrong etc. Do you see how you've been practicing all of these skills as a techie? Do the same for a proper manager's job skills and you'll see the overlap.<p>As an aside, I think all managers should have some individual responsibility also. Otherwise they will be tempted to create problems that can be 'solved' to justify their existence.<p>Re: ""politics is not your strong suit"" comments: you're expect things to work rationally but they seem to be irrational. Being techie who's always open to the possibility that you might be wrong, you're getting a second opinion to check your conclusions. Nothing wrong with that; that's a strength.",1236704377

Of course, people in the UNIX/web tradition would probably not admit that great hackers exist in those cultures, but they've put out some pretty impressive software...<p>Also - I suspect that great UNIX/web hackers don't use IDEs because the IDEs for those languages <i>suck</i>.  I work on a C++ web team.  If you glance around our monitors, everyone has the same setup: 4-6 terminals, 3-5 emacs/vim windows open, and Firefox.

If I find myself doing something at a lower level than the rest of the function, it's time to break things out.<p>- If I find myself using the word 'and' to describe what a function does, and it isn't pretty high up the abstraction ladder and primarily just driving calls out to other functions, it probably needs to get broken up.<p>- I'm not formal about it, but my mental metric for my code is to minimize 'total loc + total indentation * some constant', meaning I'm willing to trade loc to reduce nesting, to a point.<p>- I like functions to be no longer than a screenful.

The client would specify the URL scheme, port and an arbitrary name and the server would generate and return a URL, or an error if it doesn't support the requested scheme (servers could support a very limited set of schemes and ports, perhaps just one). Raw socket endpoints would use ""tcp://host:port"" and ""udp://host:port"". Servers that provide raw sockets would probably want to create a subdomain for each endpoint to avoid port contention. Since the server knows the URL scheme, it can transparently do caching/filtering/mangling for particular protocols.

The key was there were only 3 of us, who knew the code thoroughly.<p>Fast forward 20 years and I an flying solo on a vast JBoss/Spring?Struts/Hibernate project.  I just added a feature with 6 lines of functional code, along with another similar piece in a DAO to get the data out of a database.  Essentially, I was mapping a key to an inventory item to a key to a document.  The feature was about 80 lines because of Java baggage and Spring injections.  In addition I had to modify another 10 files of interfaces, implementations, struts actions, DAO's, a jsp, struts xml, and spring xml.<p>Another place where there is a functionless proliferation of small routines is caused by the java method overloading model.  A common case is to have a method with several parameters, most of which have common defaults.

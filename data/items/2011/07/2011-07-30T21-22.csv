2826915,comment,2826493,2826868,2,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Seriously, start on Twitter. Everybody who's anybody in the Toronto developer scene is pretty active on Twitter these days. Find a few developers with blogs, follow them, then start following a few of their followers or people they RT. From Twitter, start attending some meet-ups. If you're an iPhone,  Android, Python, Ruby or JS developer, it's a pretty good job market right now. Most of the places you'll want to work at are right in the downtown core so you can bike, walk, or subway/streetcar it to work. That also makes socializing vastly easier as everyone is clustered in the same area.<p><a href=""http://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Web-App-Developers/events/22556421/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/HTML5-Web-App-Developers/events/225564...</a><p><a href=""http://techtalksto.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techtalksto.com/</a><p>I know there are a ton of Toronto lurkers on here too.",1312063081

This dramatically increases your chances of being hired, because it replaces the technical interview. You just have to prove that you're capable of dealing with other human beings, and most people can do that.<p>Do something -- anything -- to get your code out there. Even if it's the most obscure and idiosyncratic library, throw it on Github.<p>I got a ticket to the Valley on the strength of some decently interesting (but by no means amazing) open source code. And I'm not even American and have no CS education, so it was considerably more difficult for me than it will be for you.<p>Incidentally, my current employer, the Wikimedia Foundation, is very open to remote contractors.

Wanted to think of the simplest yet compelling rules for a word game that used scrabble-like tiles. Some interactions were tweaked along the way because of the physical layout on the screen, but most everything was thought up that first night.<p>Time on implementation: a few days. Getting the whole game engine working was pretty fast, then just integrating the logic with the interface took a while. Learned about (and added) multi-player through Game Center in one sit-down session on a Friday night.<p>The part that took the longest (it feels like) was just entering all of the Leaderboard and Achievement data into the Game Center console on Apple's site. Then of course writing the logic in the game to trigger each achievement when they should be unlocked.<p>The graphics: several hours, probably a total of 10. Tweaking the tiles took the longest.<p>edit: added to answer parent's edit: I don't have go-to books really. This was the first game I've ever written (except for Rock, Paper, Scissors in BASIC when I was 9). So I just was learning as I went. Usually I just use Google/Stack Overflow for technical questions, but for the game part I just mashed together observations I had made while playing other apps (especially word games lately).",1312062590

2826879,comment,2826314,2826665,1,0,trentonstrong,,,"Syslog implementations like syslog-ng support both TCP and UDP relaying of all log data on a machine to a centralized Syslog server, and can even bypass storing those logs to the source machine's disk at all.  Syslog-ng also supports inserting that data directly into MySQL, and there are various other backends (like Splunk, though I know it's commercial) that can accept the TCP and UDP streams and index them in all sorts of fancy ways.<p>I think the key point here is that all the above mentioned implementations have significant adoption and are in a sense ""battle-tested"".  For example, what if your background worker has failed and log events are piling up in the Redis list you are using as queue?  Do you have monitors in place to detect that situation, and at what value do your alarms go off?  Projects like this have a way of taking a lot more time than originally thought, often at the expense of your core development time.  I personally don't like spending the time writing and maintaining code for a project that isn't aligned with the problem I'm trying to solve, so I avoid it whenever possible.<p>On the flip side, if you are setting out to build a really robust logging system on top of Redis, and that's something of value to your organization, then more power to you!",1312062563

You're immediately jumping to the dogmatic conclusion that if there are less women in computer science right now, it <i>must</i> be because someone else is setting up obstacles to hold them back.  But we don't actually know this to be the case.<p>It may instead be down to a lack of interest.  It may be because the best and brightest programmers are all hackers who have been obsessed with computers since age 12; that's the kind of person you need to be, it seems, to keep up in this field, and that's a very male profile.  Are we to cry ""discrimination!"" if it turns out that 12 year old girls are genetically predispositioned to prefer socializing with friends, over intrinsically loner activities like tinkering with computers?<p>It may even be a matter of aptitude.  It's well known that although males and females, as groups, have roughly the same mean IQ scores, males have a greater variance in their scores.  This means that if you look at the extremes of low or high intelligence, you'll find more males than females in either direction.<p><a href=""http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.fsu.edu/~baumeistertice/goodaboutmen.htm</a><p>Programming is not only an intellectually demanding career, but your potential as a programmer seems to correlate with your intelligence more tightly than in most other occupations.

This may be taboo to speak of, but we shouldn't let dogmatic value judgments cloud a discussion about empirical truth.<p>So what am I saying?  I'm not claiming to know why there are more males than females in computer science.  If there is some sort of hidden institutional misogyny keeping women from succeeding in this field, then of course that's a bad thing and should be fought.

It leaves us with a climate sensitivity of 3C for a DOUBLING of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Of course, this assumes the existence of positive feedbacks in the climate system.

This is assumed to be a result of the aftermath of the Norman conquest of England, where an Anglo-Norman-speaking elite were the consumers of the meat, produced by lower classes, which happened to be largely Anglo-Saxon[citation needed], though this same duality can also be seen in other languages like French, which did not undergo such linguistic upheaval (e.g. boeuf ""beef"" vs. vache ""cow"").<p>With the exception of beef and pork, the distinction today is gradually becoming less and less pronounced (venison is commonly referred to simply as deer meat, mutton is lamb, and chicken is both the animal and the meat over the more traditional term poultry.

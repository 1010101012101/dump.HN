The customer service at these companies is great and helps sort through 1 million+ skews, which is completely different from picking 1 out of 20 TVs at Best Buy.<p>Their customers are companies like Caterpillar who need projects to be on time and same day delivery. Fastenal even puts fasteners directly inside of bins on the assembly lines so that the customer doesn't have to haul a huge chunks of metal.<p>Amazon would have to seriously boost its service (ie, same day to location) delivery to gain the non-retail customer base as well as expand its sales staff expertise dramatically (which of the 1000 cutting tool bits do I need for X job, what angle does it have to be installed at etc?). What this will do is consolidate the industry with Amazon and the existing big players at the expense of the mom & pops which are over 80% of the market.<p>It's a $140-160bn a year market. Just goes to show how much opportunity there is in technology to expand outside of consumer-focused businesses.",1335218244

3881162,comment,3879504,3879504,1,0,hlfcoding,,,"The whole concept of ""digital modernism"" is a fluke since modernism emerged from seeking functionality, not aesthetics, while the former is trying to emulate modernism on GUIs. Print design can appear ""modern"" and ""Swiss"" since its function is to be read. GUIs are different, and require new thinking to design and style correctly. Just removing the ""style"" portion and calling it modern is like adding fins onto the back of a car to make it more ""space-age"". Apple already debunked this movement, since the general user obviously prefers the higher-fidelity GUI -- even if the trend is now growing out of proportion. For a designer with a trained eye, of course s/he needs less visual cues to figure out the GUI, so anything remotely physical looks overdone. I would react the same way when approaching from a modern graphic design standpoint: Hey, that's not how things should look if I apply the grand unified theory of modern design that I learned in design school. I'd say no one is closer to getting ""digital modernism"" correct than Android, but essentially redefining what it means for a GUI to even be modern. This idea from the article to knockoff the Swiss movement is sadly, a joke. I've used Prismatic beta, and the UI didn't wow me, at all (from either designer or layman standpoint).",1335217992

The code you ran isn't quite what <i>/etc/profile</i> does. Here's a run of that on an older machine where I work (see below on versions):<p><pre><code>    $ time eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n\n    real	0m0.106s\n    user	0m0.084s\n    sys	        0m0.021s\n</code></pre>\nHowever, looking at my current machine, I realize that <i>/usr/libexec/path_helper</i> is no longer a shell script at all. It's compiled. Running that same test on a newer machine, I get this:<p><pre><code>    $ time eval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n\n    real	0m0.004s\n    user	0m0.001s\n    sys  	0m0.003s\n</code></pre>\nSo, in a nutshell, I think you're right for current machines: The path_helper advice looks to be out of date.

3880997,comment,3880565,3880687,11,0,csmeder,,,"Two factors are going on. That result in the current social media gold rush.<p># Factor 1<p>The first is the fact that the people who have disposable income already own more tangible items than the ultra wealthy of our cave dwelling ancestors did. In terms of value.<p># Factor 2<p>Since people already own most of the tangible things needed to live a comfortable life, consumer focused companies need methods to find the specific consumers that are currently interested in buying tangible things, or who can be convinced to be interested. They then need to profile these people and then present them with messages engineered to elicit feelings of hope for fulfillment (I say hope, because often the fulfillment does not come). This is describing classic consumer research and classic advertising. This is currently a costly process*.<p>U.S. ad spending grew 6.5% in 2010 to $131.1 billion, according to new data from Kantar Media.<p># The Result<p>A huge market has been created. A very real market. As an aggregate our private information and attention (market research & advertising) is quite valuable. Not to say this market is so vast it eclipses all others. Facebook is valued at over 100 Billion according to some. Selling tangible goods like oil or Apple products seem to still be larger than this market. So a few individual markets are larger than social networking market?<p>We live in a world where the ability to line people up, study then and then use psychological tactics to hook into their desires and wants, on an aggregate, is worth more than the products on an individual case are worth.<p># An Analogy<p>If this is hard to wrap your brain around, think of this analogy. Imagine a world where the automobile, plane, boat etc were never invented and no roads exist. However a few Rail Road companies exist. The FB RR, the Twitter RR, Instagraam RR and the Pinterest RR company. The FB RR just bought Instagram RR. Companies like Coca-Cola sell tangible products (sugar water) And before the 4 mentioned Rail Roads existed Coca-Cola did quite well selling its sugar water. It has become a billion dollar business. By way of Pony Express (Television, magazines, research groups) many people have chosen to buy Coca-Cola. However, from its point of view it could sell more and hiring men to carry large sums of sugar water long distances on horseback is expensive. And worse now that Rail Roads are popping up in small towns competing companies such as Pepsi, Jones soda, etc are delivering their sugar water for cheaper.<p>The truth is if no Rail Road existed and no Pony express, you or I would be fine. We would drink water, we would tend our farm and trade carrots for apples. Which we would use to make apple juice. Evolutionary speaking we don't need Coca-Cola. And the heads of Coca-Cola know this. If they don't start paying the FB, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest RR to ship their sugar water to local towns people will stop buying Coca-Cola. A billion dollar business is at the mercy of these 4 Rail Roads. But its not just Coca-Cola. There are millions of businesses in the same boat.<p>So yes, social networks provide intangible goods to you and I, however, to consumer focused companies they are essential for Sugar Water Co to be a billion dollar company in today's economy.<p>The result is a gold rush, and though you may feel morally against this gold rush, you cant deny its not real money, real value being created. A better mouse trap has been built. It creates wealth. In this case this mouse trap tracks you, analyzes you and convinces you to spend your money on Sugar Water. This is a tanigable, valuable and desirable good to many rich people.",1335215474

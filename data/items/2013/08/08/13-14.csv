If I am going to commit myself to another mobile platform (although I use Xubuntu on the PC), I want it to have some future. If the thing breaks after 3 years, what I am going to do? I will have to change the platform again when I buy a new device.<p>I actually question what the Canonical is doing when it comes to this. I bought Asus EEE with preinstalled Ubuntu 12.04 recently, and it&#x27;s great. However, you cannot upgrade to 12.10 because the proprietary video driver for X is missing. So what they&#x27;re thinking? If they want people to switch to Ubuntu (and I would love that, that&#x27;s why I bought this netbook), then they have to commit to it as a long term goal.<p>It seems that everybody is so impatient nowadays that if success doesn&#x27;t happen in one year, they kill the project.",1375970377

A UX designer is basically another name for a consultant who, by training, knows a lot of stuff about <i>the experience your users will have with your product.</i> Like with any consultant, the relationship can be anywhere from asking them direct questions, to getting them to make you mock-ups, to modifying your product, to having them tell you what to do. As with any other consultant, you hire them for their perspective and experience, not for some particular skill.<p>A UX guy is not necessarily good at creating pretty designs--although he&#x27;ll be able to tell you, using user-testing et al, whether a design <i>is</i> pretty. And so forth, for each thing they do. It&#x27;s not a collection of skills; it&#x27;s an approach.<p>(A similar question might be &quot;what does it mean to hire a <i>scientist?</i>&quot; Not skills; approach.)",1375970351

Because, if you assume you have a rate of return, you must assume you are taking risk in order to get returns above the risk-free rate.<p>Rather than assuming you will earn interest in the market, people may want to consider the strategy of saving like they won&#x27;t earn interest and scaling back as they get older.<p>The OP suggests that the past 139 years may not look like the future 139 years.  I&#x27;d say they almost definitely won&#x27;t.<p>The current generation entering retirement has very big problems ahead, and the younger 20-35 year old generation will have even larger problems with retirement.<p>If you follow my strategy, retirement planning is easy:<p>1)  Assume no inflation in either investments, salary, future needs (this makes sense since they match)<p>2)  Figure out how much money you want to live on in retirement using today&#x27;s dollars.<p>3)  Divide the number by an assumed interest rate.  I&#x27;m using 5% for my retirement.  (that number is higher than you would get today in income and lower than what has occurred over a long period of time.)<p>In order to have $100,000 a year salary in retirement, you would need to have $2M in the bank in today&#x27;s dollars.<p>+++This isn&#x27;t a perfect calculation, but seems far more realistic than assuming you will earn a return above inflation.

The prosecution is required to share all exculpatory evidence with the defence, but this wouldn&#x27;t be exculpatory. There is an obligation to provide probable cause in order to justify each search, seizure, warrant, arrest, etc. but this obligation was met - that would be the purpose of the parallel construction. Cases were tried based on probable cause that was shared, and so that probable cause must have been sufficient. The investigators simply did not disclose ALL the probable cause they had, (because some of it was secret).<p>There will be some contention over whether investigators lied or simply didn&#x27;t share all evidence. This will probably lead to some slippery wordplay. For example, in the case of a &quot;random&quot; traffic stop that was actually targeting an individual, the word &quot;random&quot; could be stretched to mean &quot;without reason&quot; - meaning that by saying it was a &quot;random&quot; traffic stop, investigators were really just not giving a reason for the stop. Since no reason is required for a random traffic stop (under this new definition), that&#x27;s all fine.<p>Perhaps the real problem here isn&#x27;t that the NSA was sharing information, but that it is easy to find probable cause when properly motivated.",1375969886

If you never try, then that someone will never be you.<p>The only trick is to find a market for the product you are offering (the market doesn&#x27;t even have to exist, if you have tested the waters and are sure that when people see your product they&#x27;ll think, &quot;I didn&#x27;t know I wanted that until I saw it&quot;), then deliver what that market wants. Once the product is done and is what the market is looking for, it&#x27;s all about getting the product in front of those users and making a compelling case for them needing what you are offering. And at that point, if you&#x27;ve done your job well, the product will sell itself.",1375969853

You can &quot;roll your own&quot; easily enough: Write a &quot;/usr/local/bin/add-relation&quot; script that takes a function and a list of arguments to configure that function.<p>Write a script that reads a config file that defines the relationships between container types (e.g. your MySQL container and your Web container), and triggers execution of those add-relation scripts. E.g. your Web container gets called with &quot;add-relation Mysql --ip [foo] --username [bar] --password [baz]&quot; and the version of the script in that container knows how to add users to MySQL.<p>That is <i>very roughly</i> the approach that Juju (Ubuntu&#x27;s orchestration system) takes.<p>The point is to split all configuration details into thress classes: Those that can be set statically on build. Those that can be decided on first boot (e.g. re-generate a ssh-host-key, get IP address etc.). And finally those that needs to be set dynamically based on what other containers are spun up.<p>The latter has no place in the Dockerfiles or images, but scripts or tools to set these config details based on input from some external source, does.<p>It may sound painful, but only if you do it to a handful of vm&#x27;s that rarely change. The moment you need to manage dozens, or need to spin vm&#x27;s up and down regularly, taking the effort to set up proper orchestration, whichever method you prefers, wins hands down to having a user set it up (I can guarantee with near 100% certainty that said user will not set them up different VMs consistently).",1375969673

Software design, copy, marketing, UI, etc. etc. Everything. We all know this and understand this.<p>What UX is, then, is <i>software quality systems engineering</i>. &quot;Everything that goes into the experience&quot; is no longer simply visual design or UI components, but a complex web of inputs and influences to manage in order to ensure quality. A good UI designer has one piece of that puzzle and ensures the visuals and interactions are spot on, but a good UX designer takes all that and more into account and extends their influence to many other areas outside the visual. It&#x27;s not their job to do all the work, but it is their job to manage the systems in place to ensure the experience is high quality.<p>Software is getting more complex and more interesting. The &quot;UX designer&quot; moniker is just a response to that; a recognition that UI designers are becoming more holistic and with wider reach. They are becoming quality management systems engineers. This requires more than just UI design, though most UI designers probably naturally have the skills and knowledge to make it happen.<p>It&#x27;s a positive development IMHO. You may not like the broad nebulous term UX, but I think if we think of it more as systems design, maybe we can start to pin it down and make it a useful job title.",1375968990

6178753,comment,6178326,6178679,5,0,ronaldx,,,"There are significant downsides to saving for a pension as well, as I will try to illustrate:<p>The advantage of putting money into a pension (rather than regular savings) is presumably that you get to save the money in a relatively tax-efficient way.<p>In the UK, you can presently take a percentage as a tax-free lump sum, and an annuity allows you take advantage of an assumed lower tax liability at retirement. That&#x27;s all very nice. However, if you have 40 (or even 50?) years until retirement, you&#x27;ll be relying on several governments not to pull those rules and pinch from your pension pot, and you&#x27;re relying on the financial industry to kindly look after your money for that long.<p>More urgently, putting money into a pension means that you don&#x27;t have it for what you need now: if you need to pay off (or simply avoid) expensive debt, or if you need to save for housing rather than paying extortionate rent/mortgage costs, those should likely be higher priority.<p>There are not many young people who can put those concerns to one side and start saving earnestly for retirement.",1375968669

Why would someone get the phone at $695 when it could go down more? Obviously the said the price won&#x27;t go down but they had said that previously when they were above $700.<p>2. $695 immediately withdrawn from your PayPal account prior to tha campaign succeeding is a hard pill to swallow for many even if you are refunded 100% if (when?) the goal is not reached.<p>3. May 2014 is a pretty long time from now and I bet the wait will end up being longer (I waited almost 1.25 years for my Leap Motion and they had significant VC backing). Too many people may not be able to think this far ahead.<p>Why did I back the project? Well, I liked the idea of making a custom hardware device and thought crowdfunding the creation was interesting.

One man residing in Russia, a Russian national, offered Snowden a job relevant to his experience. This article says nothing about the public perception of Snowden in Russia. Anything else is supposition. All he has is asylum and a job. Both things can be granted by a huge minority of people in government, of which we do not yet understand their obscured motivations and agendas.<p>* I don&#x27;t think we should be praising Russia for this - let&#x27;s remember Russia is the place where homosexuality is almost scathingly rejected, human rights violations are normal, and freedom of the press is in effect...except when it&#x27;s not. Yes, they gave Snowden asylum. I wonder <i>what</i> they could gain from that aside from just being a bunch of good guys...come on. This says nothing about the Russian people understanding America&#x27;s problems, and they are certainly not an ideal to strive towards (nothing against Russians as a people, but a lot of their laws are deplorable by modern standards).<p>* I wouldn&#x27;t trust the job, and I wouldn&#x27;t take it. I wouldn&#x27;t want any solid association with anyone, high-roller or not, who could be leveraged against me. This is paranoid, but whatever is uncertain about the NSA scandal, it&#x27;s certain the government (or members thereof) is probably desperate to retrieve Snowden.<p>* Again, as I have said <i>repeatedly</i> since this all came out - don&#x27;t let your outrage at the (vastly exaggerated) NSA scandal prevent you from seeing the truth - as a government agency, the NSA is largely beneficial to our country, and we shouldn&#x27;t seek to disband it.

So there is no way $5M in cash.\nAlso, knowing how the company used to function, I think Mike Reining was really important to its growth, so it&#x27;s really unfair to ignore his input.<p>If you look at the company story, at the time Mike had a really great career - working for Boston Consulting Group and later as the Head of New Ventures at eBay, where he worked on the Skype takeover (Google his Linkedin profile).\nIt was Vishen who was chased out of the US with the green card/visa requirements and Mike just was the only person who decided to team up with him, drop his position at eBay and set off to Malaysia to do something fresh.<p>It&#x27;s safe to say it wouldn&#x27;t happen without the German guy at all.",1375967273

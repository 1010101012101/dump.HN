Laminar flow on the leeward side means the sail is deflecting air on that side as well, generating a &quot;pull&quot; in addition to the &quot;push&quot; on the windward side.<p>The keel generates its righting moment through lift also and not only its wieght btw, since a sailboat moves through the water at a slight angle.",1412798397

I&#x27;m going to buy a laptop for use when working on sensitive data but I need help on setting it up with the right tools and configuration.<p>I&#x27;ve read a couple articles and done some preliminary research so I have some ideas. I&#x27;m not interested in trying to use TAILS. Here&#x27;s what I have so far:<p>- Debian OS
- Tor Browser
- PGP encryption of all outgoing files and emails
- some kind of full-disk encryption (Truecrypt?)<p>I have two questions as well:
1. If I travel with the laptop and airport security asks for my password to unlock FDE, is there anyway to protect against being forced to give them the key?<p>2. How should I transfer files to and from the laptop? USB key?",1412798385

There&#x27;s a lot of different ways to say the exact same thing. Why? Which is best? Are there any cases where one works but the other doesn&#x27;t, and if so, why does the other exist?<p>Yes, but which one would you remove?<p>If you disallowed the curly ones, developers would suddenly require an additional language feature to define methods which could be used like this:<p><pre><code>  using(someResource) {
    // do something with ressource
  }
</code></pre>
Apart from that {} has semicolon inference, while () doesn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s extremely helpful, if you have some expression and really want to make sure that it can&#x27;t be split into something like { doThing1, doThing2 } by an unaware developer.<p>> Total type safety is a trap.<p>Sure, there are limits on what can be done with a type system, but these options have been growing larger and larger in the last decades.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t throw away the last 40 years of progress in that area and start doing stuff manually which any decent compiler can figure out for me.<p>> Groovy<p>I haven&#x27;t heard from Groovy since a long time ago.

No matter how many people hate General Motors, the spokesmodel of the latest TV commercial is not likely getting death threats.<p>Its always the people who insist on making themselves the brands, that self-promote themselves as a brand, that attract the death threats and nut cases, just like any other &quot;brand&quot;.<p>If you can separate the brand and the person in a way even the trolls can understand, let them hate the anonymous brand all they want, what does it matter?<p>Maybe a sports analogy helps?  Everyone in the state of Wisconsin viciously hates the brand of the Chicago Bears and the journalists encourage it as much as possible.  But no one sends death threats to Mr. XYZ who is a ticket collector at gate 3.  One is a brand and hating brands is seen as a universal good (other than on social media, whoops).  The other is just some dude making his way thru life, no problem.<p>(edited to give you another example.  Look how /b/ on 4chan behaves toward women on /b/.  Not women in abstract or women in journalism, I&#x27;m talking about humans with two x chromosomes talking on /b/ itself which is about 99% male trolls (and lots of lurkers).  Frankly, /b/ behaves pretty nicely and civil almost gentlemanly toward women actually on /b/ AS LONG AS she doesn&#x27;t go all self promotional &quot;gimmie attention look here I am a girlie on /b/ everyone look at me because you&#x27;re mostly guys and I are a girl so you must worship me its all about me me me me&quot; and then they turn on her like starving wolves beginning with &quot;show us (you can guess) or GTFO&quot; and it generally kinda devolves from there, in fact it gets quite a bit worse, and very quickly.  They now hate her because she is now a brand and not a person.  Find me a trollier place on the internet than /b/ (good luck) and I bet they behave the same way, people treat people like people, and some people treat some brands like dirt, worse than dirt, worse than you can imagine dirt being treated, and if the brand happens to be an intensely self promotional person instead of an abstract entity or corporation or idea or whatever then things are really going to suck for that brand-which-happens-to-be-a-real-woman.  Or TLDR if you want to be treated like a person on 4chan on /b/, its really easy no matter who or what you are, just behave like a person, not a brand or a PR rep or marketdroid.  The internet is very nice to people, and occasionally utterly shockingly brutal to brands.  Go choose your destiny...)",1412798046

Is that the same as DRM? In practice, mostly, since it&#x27;s hard to see how that particular scheme would work without DRM. (But licensing is not the same as DRM, right? I buy a lot of DRM-free tech books, but that doesn&#x27;t give me license to put those books up for free on my web site.)<p>But I&#x27;d nonetheless argue that the primary issue is <i>not</i> that Adobe is implementing new licensing schemes of dubious value.

I don&#x27;t use Adobe Digital Editions unless I absolutely have to, but until now that&#x27;s been because the software is awful, not because it&#x27;s philosophically objectionable.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that it may not be entirely fair to describe Adobe as &quot;obsessed with rights management&quot;; they&#x27;re providing a platform for publishers, and using DRM -- or not -- is the publishers&#x27; choice.

They have designed a concept for a fusion reactor that, when scaled up to the size of a large electrical power plant, would rival costs for a new coal-fired plant with similar electrical output.<p>. . . .<p>&quot;Right now, the UW’s concept is about one-tenth the size and power output of a final product, which is still years away. The researchers have successfully tested the prototype’s ability to sustain a plasma efficiently, and as they further develop and expand the size of the device they can ramp up to higher-temperature plasma and get significant fusion power output.&quot;<p>Well, good luck to them. But this is a press release about a &quot;concept,&quot; and it has not been tested out as a source of electrical power (as contrasted with being a test-bed for plasma containment) at all yet, at any scale. Solving the plasma containment problem for a fusion reactor is something I have been waiting for more than forty years. If it was easy, it would have already happened. Maybe the new concept will help solve that problem, but maybe not. At the very least, we still have NO IDEA what the economics of running a power plant will be at scale when using this concept.<p>Many, many submissions to HN are based at bottom on press releases, and press releases are well known for spinning preliminary research findings beyond all recognition. This has been commented on in the PhD comic &quot;The Science News Cycle,&quot;[1] which only exaggerates the process a very little. More serious commentary in the edited group blog post &quot;Related by coincidence only? University and medical journal press releases versus journal articles&quot;[2] points to the same danger of taking press releases (and news aggregator website articles based solely on press releases) too seriously. Press releases are usually misleading. Not all press releases spin their statements as badly as one very bad example a skeptical blogger commented on,[3] but all of them should be compared to independent sources for a second opinion. Whether in medical research or in reports about new breakthroughs in energy production, press releases often run ahead of the facts.<p>The most sure and certain finding of any preliminary study will be that more research is needed. All too often, preliminary findings don&#x27;t lead to further useful discoveries in science, because the preliminary findings are flawed. The obligatory link for any discussion of a report on a research result like the one kindly submitted here is the article &quot;Warning Signs in Experimental Design and Interpretation&quot;[4] by Peter Norvig, director of research at Google, on how to interpret scientific research.

If you go to us, we just route your job to the employee profiles in our database, they respond if they are interested and for what wage, and you receive a list of potential employees with different prices, that you may or may not book.
2.) Software Technology: Agencies do pretty much everything by hand. The have software to manage their processes, but they don&#x27;t really automize any processes.

And over the course of a year or two your debt will likely change hands multiple times, at incredible devaluation. (Listen to the This American Life episode, it&#x27;s great in this regard.)<p>These companies will make all sorts of outlandish claims about what might happen if you don&#x27;t pay. In reality, nothing at all will happen outside of the hit your credit rating will take if they take the issue that far. All things considered, that&#x27;s a non-issue for most people facing debts they have no way of repaying.<p>In the not very likely event you are actually summoned to court, what will happen is that the lawyers working for the current owner of your debt will try to strong-arm you before you go before a judge. They&#x27;ll say &#x27;let&#x27;s settle this now before things get serious in there&#x27; etc., and will offer to accept a fraction of what the paper says you owe.<p>That&#x27;s when you ask, &#x27;where is your witness?&#x27;.

The wind is split by the leading edge of the sail (the mast, headstay, or luff). It is split into two turbulent streams, one on each side of the sail.  One stream has slightly less force on the sail so the sail begins to move in that direction.  As the flow stabilizes over that side, the wind moves faster on that side than on the turbulent side.  This creates lift like an airplane wing.  So the wind is actually pulling the sail, not pushing it.<p>Lift on the sail causes the boat to heel (lean over).  Some of the lifting force is counterbalanced by the keel underwater keeping the boat upright.  The remainder of the force pushes the boat downwind.  However, the flat keel underwater prevents the boat from sliding downwind, with the result that the boat is forced forward.<p>I recommend you read this book for your next version:<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Sail-Power-Complete-Guide-Handling/dp/0394727150"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Sail-Power-Complete-Guide-Handling/dp/...</a>",1412795271

Many love it! But I want to be legally allowed to write this kind of software and release it without a backdoor.<p>It&#x27;s hard enough when we all fight about implementation details and security vs. convenience.

I wasn&#x27;t even talking about pure functional programming. By talking about <i>variables</i> captured by closures, I&#x27;m implicitly not doing so.<p>In the context of server programming, by using the word &#x27;statelessness&#x27;, I meant that the request (from clicking the link) doesn&#x27;t need to go back to the same server that created the link. Having an in-memory hash-table containing closures or continuations keyed by an ID in the request implies that request needs to ultimately reach back to the same machine, one way or another.<p>I&#x27;m talking about programming the Lisp-style multi-request process using continuations (as described by pg in his essays), except making them work in a stateless way - without the requirement for hash tables full of continuations that need periodic collecting, with the consequence that the links go stale.<p>A request handler generating such continuations would, of course, need to be simple and lightweight, not deep or complex. Code artifacts and stateful resources would need to be serialized using keys that contain enough information to find or recreate them. Imagine having server-side URLs for every function, for every resource, where doing a request for a function pointer or a resource could potentially open a database connection or load a library. The keys would be analogous to such URLs.<p>Consider an activation record. It is the storage for local variables, parameters and the function return location (aka continuation, when you twist your mind around it). The activation record for any given function has a particular signature. Let&#x27;s say one of these local variables is a Customer object, mapped by an ORM from the database. That is something that can be reduced to an ID; if you know that this activation record only ever has a Customer in that slot, you can potentially serialize that object as a single number.<p>Keep the chain of activation records short, and they act mostly as a path through a tree to the current state of a process or interaction. Function a calls function b calls function c, which returns a result to the client, along with a continuation (or more interestingly, multiple continuations). A serialized continuation would be little more than a record of the current step in the overall process, everything needed to pick up where one left off. I think, with the right level of language abstraction, this can be made very slim.<p>(PS: I detect a certain amount of exasperation in your tone.

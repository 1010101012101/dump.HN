6879853,comment,6878974,6879598,8,0,leoedin,,,"This is a good comment. It&#x27;s easy to forget that the proportion of people &quot;above the glass ceiling&quot; is tiny, regardless of gender. Girls outperform boys consistently through school and, as you&#x27;ve said, admissions to university have a significant gender skew. With the decline of many of the more traditional blue collar male-dominated industries, our system is quietly failing a high proportion of boys.<p>It&#x27;s hard to discuss this stuff without verging dangerously close to the rather toxic &quot;mens rights&quot; movement, but I think there needs to be more recognition that the male dominated glass floored executive club is not just a &quot;boys club&quot;, but an &quot;old boys club&quot;. It&#x27;s not particularly welcoming to women, but it&#x27;s also not particularly welcoming to men from the wrong class or background. Our organisations may have a male dominated executive, but the middle layer is rapidly becoming skewed the opposite way.<p>When we talk about &quot;equal opportunities&quot; only in the context of gender, I think we miss the less obvious inequalities in our industry. Walk into an office of software engineers and it&#x27;s immediately obvious that there&#x27;s a significant gender imbalance. What isn&#x27;t obvious without asking questions is that there&#x27;s also a significant imbalance in socioeconomic background.<p>I should add that I&#x27;m not aiming to detract from efforts to see greater gender equality in our industry. My first comments apply more to broader society than tech, and I&#x27;m definitely an advocate for equal opportunities regardless of gender. This challenge is, however, much less black and white than it&#x27;s sometimes portrayed in the media.",1386669510

6879836,comment,6879667,6879795,20,0,nostrademons,,,"Problem is that it requires that the app handle all the security aspects of talking to the Internet, because STDIN/STDOUT is an unrestricted protocol.  Normally when you write a webapp you have a well-tested parser to validate the HTTP request for you, and you have safe APIs to access parameters, and your templating language auto-escapes dangerous characters for you, and the response goes through middleware to prevent XSRF attacks, and the whole thing is written in a safe language where there&#x27;s no possibility of buffer overruns.<p>With this, you have to handle all of that in your application binary.  You can certainly do this.  However, if you are asking why you need to do this, you are almost certainly not ready to do this.<p>I agree that this is a pretty useful method of tying software systems together.  However, one of the the systems you&#x27;re tying together is the public Internet, where all sorts of danger lurks.  Writing secure parsers is <i>hard</i>.  I&#x27;ve written an HTML parser [1], one of the most well-tested ones out there (I spent the better part of a year doing nothing but testing & debugging, and ran literally billions of documents through it), and Google&#x27;s security team still found 2 bugs in it with about a day&#x27;s work.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser</a>",1386669249
6879834,comment,6877692,6878873,4,0,weland,,,"Quines are not quite the same thing.<p>Reasonably simple illustration: in Common Lisp, it is possible to write a function that takes a mathematical expression as an argument and returns another expression, as its derivative.<p>So basically I can write (pseudo-lisp-ish):<p>(defun diff (f) ... )<p>then call it like this:<p>(diff &#x27;(+ (pow x 2) x)<p>and I&#x27;d get the expression<p>(+ (* 2 x) 1)<p>as a result. The point is, however, that this expression is Lisp-callable code. If I already have a function p, I can write:<p>(setq dp (diff p))<p>and dp is now the function computed by (diff p).<p>This is not necessarily the most practically-useful example, but I think it&#x27;s closest to being a strong illustration of the principle. In a nutshell, you can do symbolic manipulation with code from within your code.<p>Edit: I just read your other post from this thread. It&#x27;s important to note that this happens <i>at runtime</i>, not at compile time.<p>This isn&#x27;t impossible to do in C if you <i>really want</i>, but it wouldn&#x27;t be portable (the reason for this is left at the user&#x27;s discretion). Think about how you would do the same in C: write a function that takes a pointer to a function f, and returns a pointer to another function g, so that g is the derivative of f. It&#x27;s obviously ok to restrict f to common mathematical operators.<p>I can think about ways of doing it, but it ain&#x27;t pretty.",1386669235

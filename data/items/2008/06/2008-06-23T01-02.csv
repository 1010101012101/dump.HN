224593,comment,224191,224396,0,0,oz,,,"Amen. I remember loving math at age 12 (grade 7 here in Jamaica), and hating it up to recently. I honestly don't know how I passed my high school exams. I got the lowest grade you could pass with.<p>I started a CS degree at the University of Technology in Jamaica in August 2005. We had to take an aptitude test to get in, which included some math. I passed, not because I understood the math, but because I could reason things well.<p>I started programming (in Python) at age 14 or so, and knew I was good at it. What bothered me at Uni was that I knew somewhere that I was good at math, because I understood programming. I actually told my classmates so. We had PreCalculus in the first semester. I failed of course; I'd stopped attending classes and took the time to learn some things from scratch. I actually picked leaves and played with them till understood how number systems, basic operations, fractions and exponents work! I was working out of an American elementary school textbook. My friends thought I was crazy, but I knew, somewhere, that I was right.<p>During the summer after year 1, I got offered a job by a man working as technical consultant to a telecommunications startup. I went to his house the Sunday afternoon, and Monday morning I reported to work, in the only 'work clothes' I had. When the summer was up, I stayed on. The pay sucked, but I would have done ANYTHING not to go back to school. Luckily, the man who had hired me was also 'anti-school.' He knew his telecoms well; self taught. My parents, naturally, wanted me to go to school, but they didn't push me, knowing I can be quite...strong-minded.<p>It was at that job I first realized just how good I was. Within a few months, I was conducting interviews for the IT department. I interviewed university grads, and most of them didn't even come close. I remember asking one of them about the Nyquist Theorem (which I knew only cursorily). I swear he nearly jumped out of the chair! I was obviously younger than he, and asking advanced questions. I loved it.<p>What I discovered about myself at that job was that I TRULY love to learn! Most people just. dont. care. They only want to know that they pass the exams. They don't have that child-like curiosity about how things work. I didn't have a computer at the time, so I stayed at work till 11pm most nights, just reading online books, whitepapers and tutorials. I was walking lonely streets to get to the taxi stand after work, but I didn't care. I was learning. Safety second. On some nights, I'd call a cab to take me home, which cost the equivalent of $5USD. We were paid weekly-the equivalent of about $60USD. But I didn't care. I was learning, and loving it.<p>In the past few months, I've experienced what can best be described as a 'creative awakening' (insert moving music here). I've started writing and drawing again, and am actually starting out in graphic design. I'm listening to more classical music and operas, and listening to less rap, dancehall and reggae. I came across Lockhart's Lament, and it rang so true that I had to put it down a few times. Vindication tastes good; you can believe that.<p>Lockhart makes the point that mathematics is a creative endeavor like any other. I remember always wondering why the quadratic equation equaled 0. Why not 543.98? I didn't understand what exactly they were trying to accomplish. A few months ago, before my 'creative awakening,' (sounds esoteric, doesn't it) I started spending my days at the library. (I was fired from the job, a few months before the entire group of companies crashed, the CEO is now on bail, go figure). I came across a book about the history of Mathematics, from the Egyptians  and Babylonians to Hero of Greece,and his postulate that all lines are equal since they have corresponding points(Google it). It then talked about the Hindus. Turns out, they have to build their altars with specific proportions, and developed quadratics as a means to that end. I was furious. Why hadn't I been taught this at 15? But I was also delighted: I'd always felt that many of those who got good grades in Maths class didn't really understand it, they could only apply formulas to specific exercises. I felt that I was now in an exclusive club. I haven't visited the library since that day; got distracted, you see (you know how nerds are).<p>But this is why Lockhart's Lament rang so true. He's also not the only one to criticize contemporary Math education. Google ""Morris Kline"" who's written books on the subject. Richard Feynman also wrote on just how abominably bad most textbooks are.<p>Damn, is it 8:55 PM already? I'm actually at a friends house; I came to get me some cake and icecream.",1214186159
224592,comment,224191,224282,0,0,vitaminj,,,"Believe it or not, formal education and self-study aren't mutually exclusive... you can do a combination of both and benefit from the value of each style of learning.<p>One of the good things about most tertiary institutions is that you're not obliged to show up to any of the lectures, so if your preferred learning style is self-study, then you can skip the lectures and just learn the material by yourself. But you can still take advantage of aspects of formal education that are valuable for autodidacts, whether it's clear course structures, access to good professors, hanging out with smart peers (ie. learning by osmosis), access to expensive journal subscriptions, deadlines to motivate your learning, etc.<p>Anyway I wouldn't write off school so quickly. A really motivated autodidact can use school to their advantage, instead of lamenting its obvious flaws. Study the required material, but then learn beyond the basic necessities of the course, study whatever interests you. Don't be too concerned about grades and don't bother studying just for the test. If you're learning for the love of it and for a true, deep understanding of the subject, then let me assure you that you'll have no problem passing.",1214186062

Might be music, might be hiking, might be journalism, might be Ultimate Frisbee playing, whatever. Find something that isn't related to what you'll end up doing 9-to-5 after you get out, and explore that thing.<p>EDIT: slackerIII's point about making new friends is also spot-on.

224557,comment,224520,224520,0,0,Kevin_Johnson,,,"First off, since your a sophomore, your plans will change.  Bet money on it.  Don't get caught up in specifics of where you want to be.  Instead take advantage of the powerful abstractions where you can to work out what ""axioms of life"" you want to design your life with.  That's your homework assignment in the unwritten curriculum of the university.  The vast majority of people fail that lesson, good folks recognize it and get it partially right, the great people master this lesson, implement, and refine it for the rest of their lives.<p>Always consider your personality.  My regret may be exactly what you DON'T want to do.  Having said that...  Being a physics students at very good engineering school, and having participated in student design competitions my only regret is not having taken more pure mathematics.  In science and engineering, if it works, there's your evidence.  You have shown it can happen.  Mathematics I viewed, at the time being so simple minded, as a set of neat tricks for solving physics problems (or engineering problems, which at the time I thought of simplistically as merely applied physics problems).  The reason I regret not taking more pure math isn't the theorems or skills I missed getting, it was the mindset.  Every profession and field looks at the world in a particularly special way.  It's a more abstract version of the saying ""If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.""  I'm actually doing research in graduate school now in mathematics and I'm really glad for it.  The perspective from being a bit physicist, a bit engineer, and now a bit mathematician really gives one a lot of versatility, and that's where the variety of experience in the ""hard subjects"" pays off.  You see, everyone who has specialized to be only one thing, think university professors, are like shaft mines.  The specialists dig deep to get at the really rich seams, but they pass by a lot of pretty good stuff following the very richest dig through their subject.  Take a bit more breath in your studies and you will see lots of good stuff, and how it's connected together.<p>Finally, have fun too.  Every day of my undergraduate schooling was a cycle of learn, work, play, build, fight, drink, sleep, and repeat tomorrow.  It's the best that could have happened in spite of being exhausting, all consuming, obsessive, and unrelenting.  I loved it because to me that is fun.<p>Best of luck to you.",1214182822

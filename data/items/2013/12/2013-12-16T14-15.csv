6915034,comment,6914092,6914648,1,0,hyp0,,,"First off, excellent idea. It seems simple and straightforward to automate web site interaction, especially for those lacking APIs (e.g. my stoneage bank, to check for telegraphic transfer payments).<p>But I&#x27;m torn. On the one hand, I support developers getting paid for creating tools/libraries (instead of working on in-house software; or consumer/business startups). I think it&#x27;s better for the world. It&#x27;s also how I&#x27;ve supported myself for the last 10 years.<p>On the other hand, I don&#x27;t like your email-wall etc.<p>As I see it, you need to serve two markets: the businesses that will pay for your software; and everyone else, who won&#x27;t pay, but <i>will promote it</i> word-of-mouth/google juice, through blog posts, stackoverflow answers, reddit/HN posts/comments etc etc etc (this is incredibly helpful for getting sales). Thus, you need to serve both, and make it both easy to buy, and easy to <i>not</i> buy.<p>1. Your email-wall is one solution. People can still get it free, they just don&#x27;t like. I think it will fail (but it might work, who knows?)<p>2. Another way is two versions: free/community/demo and paid. Find features that matters a lot to businesses (or sounds like it), and doesn&#x27;t matter to everyone else.  Quotas are another way, although hard to enforce in a library (easy in a webapp), but also consider that legit businesses prefer buying over cracking. (e.g. pkzip got pirated like crazy, but the guy also made money).<p>3. A way to do open source is &quot;dual-licensing&quot;: GPL + commercial. The GPL forbids closed-source distribution, so you license it to people who want to distribute it. The problem with this (I did it) is long sales-cycles, because there&#x27;s no urgency for people to buy, they already have it. (they <i>do</i> eventually pay, it just takes a long time).\nGhostscript does something similar.<p>But your big problem is more subtle: you have a cool idea that is truly valuable to businesses - but it&#x27;s easy to implement. I think most coders here could hack a barely-working prototype within 2 hours. All it takes is one of them to publish it on github, and keep working on it for 6 months, and you&#x27;re finished. It&#x27;s not because theirs is <i>better</i> than yours - but because <i>they will get ALL the word-of-mouth and google-juice.</i><p>Thus, you need to serve both markets. This denies oxygen to the copy-cats - why would anyone bother with that half-assed knock-off, when they can get the real thing from you? Even if someone starts a clone, it will languish without any interest or feedback. People also like to reward originators (provided it doesn&#x27;t actually cost them anything...).<p>Another thing you can do is implement difficult features - from skimming your site, it all looks pretty easy... but if you find some obstacle that seems to kill how it should work, that&#x27;s a <i>GREAT</i> thing. Solve it, and you have a barrier (this is what happened for me). Or as Joel said, &quot;where there&#x27;s muck there&#x27;s brass&quot;.<p>But the most important thing for your long-term success is to realize the situation is dynamic. You have to keep improving constantly (this often means discovering new ways to improve, even when it seems there aren&#x27;t any). Even if someone copies, you still have the latest and greatest. Thus, you can measure your barrier in time - how long before they catch up? Even if it&#x27;s only 6 months - or even 1 month - provided yours is always significantly better, everyone (businesses and others) will prefer it. There&#x27;s also some lag, that it takes for word to get out of a competitor, to build word-of-mouth/google-juice, and to convince pragmatists that it really is credible. So this &quot;market&quot; lead also gives you some time (probably only a few months though).<p>Note: even when hackers are no longer excited, businesses will still be interested - because they don&#x27;t buy cool technology, they buy solutions to their problems.  They don&#x27;t care how sexy it is, they care if it works, and that&#x27;s it. So don&#x27;t be discouraged when you are no longer hot.<p>Finally, to address your comment directly: I agree it&#x27;s a problem, for libraries especially. I think open-source + consulting is a terrible idea (unless you&#x27;re a consultant - then it&#x27;s fantastic publicity. But conflict with making it easy to use, so it doesn&#x27;t need a consultant...).<p>Looking at wildly successful developer tools, they seem to be desktop tools: IDEs (JetBrains on the frontpage now); xmlspy and a bunch of xml tools.  I don&#x27;t know why this is (Maybe it feels like non-code to programmers, unlike a library? Maybe because it&#x27;s more work, and needs GUI-skills/interest?)<p>I&#x27;m intrigued by the idea of &quot;service components&quot;: library-like functionality, used through web-APIs. (In contrast, most current web-APIs access data and/or business service, not a computational service). It would sit in the cloud, next to their web-app, so it&#x27;s fast - but they don&#x27;t have the source, and can only access it  to via the web-API. Note that libraries naturally are accessed through an API - this is just on a different machine, like a DB often is (you probably want to config the query, <i>then</i> run it, to minimize network traffic). Then you can do quota restrictions, like any other web-app.<p>---<p>One thing though: if it doesn&#x27;t work, <i>please</i> try a few other strategies before giving up. You have a valuable idea there.",1387205694

There is an overall feeling of meddling in other people&#x27;s affairs associated with most US actions nowadays.<p>Germany already has declined participating in the attack on Iraq, but still provides plenty of passive (possibly also some active, even though that would be illegal) support (logistics, allowing air bases) and most people still perceive it as the right action.<p>It is hard to find recent surveys on the topic and especially Transatlantic Trends seems to refuse to ask the question if Europe should continue to support US military actions further and focuses mainly on the NATO (neither drone strikes nor the Iraq War are NATO operations).",1387205651

JavasScript allows for much the same, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that, it&#x27;s just not something that will last into the future.

One thing: the author falls victim to a common, unfortunate mistake in calculating the percentage gains: <i>...120 cycles. That’s a 30-percent speed-up.</i> and then <i>...98 cycles. Compared to the original code, that’s 60 percent faster.</i><p>The right way to calculate this figure is (t1 - t0)/t0, rather than the author&#x27;s formula which seems to be (t1 - t0)/t1.  For instance: (157 - 98)/98 = 60%, but the actual amount is (157 - 98)/157 = a 38% speed up.  A heuristic: 60% of 157 will be much more than 60 (since 60% of 100 = 60), which means a 60% speed up would reduce the speed to below 97 cycles.<p>It gets even more misleading the more efficient it gets: <i>Adding up the cycles, the total was just 1689. I had shaved almost 1200 cycles off of my friend’s code. That’s a 70 percent speed-up!</i>  The author has 1200/1689 = 71%, but the correct numbers yield 1200/(1689+1200) = 42%.<p>Not that I don&#x27;t think these are significant gains, but it&#x27;s just misleading to label them like this.

The average developer salary in the US in 2010 was $90k a year(<a href=\"http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer/salary\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/software-developer...</a>). Say this developer works 260 days a year, so makes roughly $350 a day. If it doesn&#x27;t take him 75%, but only 25% less effort to write and maintain some web automation code, then each day of him working with Helium saves the company $87.5. This means that after about 11 working days, using Helium will have paid off, leaving potentially 249 more days in the year during which to reap Helium&#x27;s benefits.",1387205030

Jeremy and his partner Nathan Barry wrote &quot;The App Design Handbook&quot; and pulled in $36,297 in the first 24 hours and over $56,000 in the first month. He posted these earnings on Twitter at which point I urged him to write up a blog post regarding his success. Jeremy replied with the following disheartening tweet:<p><pre><code>    &quot;@cballou kind of like this? [url redacted]\n    \n    That actually hit HN homepage but the mods \n    took it down :(&quot;\n</code></pre>\nHe also followed up our conversation with:<p><pre><code>    &quot;@cballou yeah, actually we’ve had several posts taken\n    off the front page. Don’t get it&quot;\n</code></pre>\nMy question to the HN community, and particularly the mods, is WTFMATE?<p>Jeremy is a well respected member of the community with an Apple Design Award under his belt. He has a substantial following in the iOS community and my initial inclination is that him sharing the blog post led to upvotes which triggered flagging/deleting his post. I believe that in the case of a post deemed to be as beneficial to the community as this one, you&#x27;d realize it&#x27;s likely not upvote gaming but true interest.<p>I&#x27;ll follow up with links to the Twitter conversation and the original article that was removed.",1387202444

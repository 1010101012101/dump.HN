I've heard people say things like, ""We should eat our lunch before someone else does"".  The problem is that starting lunch too early can result in you losing your core business too quickly.<p>For example, if MS is making $15B a year in client products right now.  And over time, against Google and such, that number will drop $1B/year until it hits $3B.  Or they could accelerate that drop, such that it drops $3B per year, but they can generate $1B dollars per year by eating their lunch.<p>While it may be ""fashionable"" to be the cutting edge company generate $1B/year on some cool technology.  It's actually prudent to fight against the new technology as the incumbent for as long as you can.  And try to find totally new markets, rather than eating your own lunch.",1275677806

1405232,comment,1404298,1404298,0,0,kunjaan,,,"I feel the author did not do a good job in defending the thesis of ""Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything.""<p>I do agree that relying on the first aha-moment,however grand it may be, to carry the entire weight of success is a bad investment. Similarly to throw away an insight without analyzing it is equally foolish. Of course, you can never predict if an idea will derive its entire value when thrown and mingled with other external factors. However that doesn't mean that the idea itself plays a small role in the success of any endeavor. Every execution step that the author talks about requires coming up or at least using the so called ideas. You need creative insights in every step of your project. This will require the same amount of diligence in  defining the purpose, testing the hypothesis and maybe even jumping that leap of faith. The author needs to clear the distinction between a conceptual idea and the execution of it.<p>Lastly, he has to mention the metric required to judge the success of an idea. Since he envelopes every single Idea into one set, he has to have a parameter to at least attest the value of them. I personally feel ideas as diverse as Darwin's idea of evolution to an entrepreneur's idea of a company to an artist's idea of an art cannot be lumped into one category.<p>I do agree with the author that ideas when defined without any context or in isolation cannot be judged. But none of the arguments that he makes truly discounts the worth of it.",1275677671

Amateurs. Here's how you sue 14,000+ P2P users"").<p>In essence, the litigation strategy followed here targets those who illegally download films produced by indie filmmakers, sues them collectively as fictitious or ""Doe"" defendants, uses subpoenas to ISPs to compel disclosures of their true identities, and then sends demand letters telling those targeted to pay $1,500 or so to settle up or face litigation that is almost a sure losing proposition for them (I had discussed why I think this is so in a commend or two made in the link above).<p>It now turns out that Time Warner Cable, instead of simply complying with the subpoena it received, has moved to quash it and this has given EFF and other rights groups a venue in which to argue that a collective suing of ""Doe"" defendants in a remote forum with which the individuals being targeted have little or no connection allegedly violates the rights of those individuals.<p>In effect, the underlying litigation strategy being used here by those suing for copyright infringement ""plays the numbers"" and depends on mass processing for its effectiveness. As the article linked to above points out, the estimated recovery on these claims to date approximates $20 million and the strategy is obviously just beginning to gain traction, with many thousands more being and about to be sued in this manner.<p>What EFF and others are trying to do is block the ability of the plaintiffs in such cases to file in one convenient venue and use a single subpoena to gather the identifying information easily and quickly. The arguments they raise suggest that this violates due process rights belonging to the persons being fictitiously sued and, therefore, that the plaintiffs should instead filed individual suits against these people in the districts where they live.<p>It these arguments stick, it obviously would upend this whole strategy but, in my view, the decades-long use of the ""Doe"" procedure, coupled with the fact that it is obviously not possible to sue individuals in the districts in which they live when you don't yet know their identities, makes it unlikely that the court will go with this argument. It will be interesting to see how the court rules.",1275677563

After Jobs returned, between 1997 and 2001 Apple caught a big upswing and then a big downswing, the up presumably aligned with the colorful iMacs/iBooks and so forth, and the drop presumably due to some combination of broader economic forces and slowdown/uncertainty to do with the OS X transition, etc. Apple stock has been going nuts since the beginning of 2003, doubling 5 times (!) in the last 7 years.",1275676342

Typically we've observed the highest drops in between the first 3 billing cycles, after that attrition rate seems to stabilize. If you're lucky attrition stabilizes after the second rebill cyle and you can better manage front end testing and customer aquisition strategy.<p>b) You're at something of a disadvantage w/price elasticity testing w/SAAS because you're going to get press, people are going to hear about you / hear about your pricing and write reviews early. If you change pricing UP, the internets will scream loudly :). Plus you have to worry about current customers getting upset, always implement price changes DOWN accross the board, always grandfather price changes UP to current users (and tell them about it so they feel warm and fuzzy).<p>A strategy we've used before is to put together a meaningful ad budget for PPC, and test the heck out of the front end pricing. Treat it like traditional elasticity testing, expecting that rebill #s will hold relatively steady on the back even though you can't predict that. The point is to get the highest front-end you can and then work it down, it's obviously much, much easier to lower pricing than raise.",1275675873

Currently his implementation and XBMC configuratino is just months, years of trial error and building based on what he needed.  Therefore the code base is poor, and overall there are a lot of things he has said if I had the chance I would do them right.<p>Him and I have decided that we are going to start with formal requirements, documentation and design and then start coding.  The hope is that this project will be open source, iterative and agile in development cycles such that we can continually produce working features to incorporate with our existing production system.<p>I am looking for thoughts, suggestions, comments on how a two man team can make a project great?

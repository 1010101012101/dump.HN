5095427,comment,5094680,5095311,1,0,fatbird,,,"The problem is that the imbalance is what's discouraging women from entering STEM careers; addressing it just means doing things like this conference is doing to increase female participation.<p><i>But to say an entire sex should do something is nonsensical. It's entirely possible they don't want to study stem.</i><p>You realize these two sentences contradict each other, I hope.  You say that it's non-sensical to discuss what the entire sex should do, then try to talk about what the entire gender may or may not want as a reason for (or against) acting.<p><i>To say that they're under-represented is to belittle what individuals choose to do with their lives.</i><p>No, it doesn't, because it doesn't require any individual to do anything, or to give an individual responsibility for what the entire gender does.<p>When I talk about ""under"" represented, I mean that absent the historical injustice of sexism, you would see a different gender balance.  And as this conference and GoGaRuCo demonstrate, when you control for the historical imbalance, women and men are selected equally to speak in a blind process, thus showing equal ability, if not interest; it's reasonable to assume that after correcting the historical artifact, gendered participation ratios would be much closer.<p>I've already agreed that affirmative action isn't the answer, but this--community outreach, basically--isn't affirmative action in any sense.",1358827191

Most created by nameless, faceless people just doing their part.<p>Which again makes me wonder why the tech world has been a week of adulation of Aaron Swartz, whose two greatest accomplishments (if you follow the lede of every story about him) were that he was pushed on the Reddit founders by PG after his own project failed (then exiting before them), and that he was one of a dozen plus people who authored a revision to a brutishly simplistic RSS 1.0 spec, his single celebrated attribute being his age.<p>I hesitate hitting add comment because I know the above is effectively sacrilegious, but I don't buy it.

Did not open to the west until ~ 1870s. The last time it was involved in trying to invade another country was as a vassal state of Kublai Khan. And yet such assertions go unchecked.<p>Korea is not belligerent and has much riding upon regional stability. We are talking about an economy that is roughly the scale of Italy's and a standard of living that is in many ways better than the US.<p>The biggest impediment to North South reunification is the immense disparity. The difference between East and West Germany was minute in comparison.<p>I am not Korean but love Korea. Have had the chance to work there (3 yrs) and know a slight bit of the history, language and culture.<p>There are many better sources of information on North Korea - don't give the Unification Church any more publicity. The Netflix documentary mentioned is a good one.<p>And stop with the misinformed ideas of Korea. It is not like China and Japan even though it is stuck in the middle. Korean language and culture compared to Chinese is roughly analogous to English with Latin. The base is completely different but Koreans borrowed Chinese philosophy and science.<p>Linguistically Korean has more in common with Mongolian and Hungarian than it does to Mandarin.",1358826624

And one side effect of that is the ability to feel shame, to feel like you're a worthless individual because of your effect on the group, which in pathological situations can result in eliminating yourself from the gene pool.  It's not that there's a gene for suicide, it's that there're genetically-based traits like empathy, ambition, and pain-tolerance that when combined with a hostile environment can result in suicide.  (One of Aaron Swartz's traits commonly referenced in his eulogies was how unusually empathetic he was.)<p>It's very well-documented that there are some genes that can be adaptive in some situations and fatal in others.  For example, sickle-cell anemia is highly adaptive in sub-Saharan Africa where it confers immunity to malaria, yet results in debilitating blood clots when expressed in some individuals.

Discrimination is discrimination, regardless of whether or not it affects a disadvantaged group in a positive way.  There is also the risk that such discrimination will only deepen the problems that caused the disproportionate representation in the first place:  people might conclude that a woman's success in a technical field was the result of the advantages she was given (e.g. by being given an unfair boost in being invited to speak at conferences), and in the worst case this will reinforce notions that women are not as good as men.  I have heard the last concern <i>from women</i> in computer science and technical fields -- women who worked hard to get where they are, who now worry that other people will doubt their abilities because of this sort of thing.<p>""Anyway, I'd still be interested to hear from you how (following your metaphor) you would suggest to dismantle the white car directly.""<p>The car is not the problem; the paint on the car is the problem.  While it is more expensive in the short-term to repaint the car, in the long run you realize savings (less fuel than the truck, no need to lay down rails, etc.).  The point here is that the problem can be attacked head-on:  the problem with female representation at conferences is a reflection of the problem with female representation in the field, which may be harder to solve but whose solution will ultimately save effort and pain in the long run.  Why waste resources on solutions that make the situation even more complicated, when we could spend resources on solutions that simplify the situation?<p>Yes, it is hard, but there are people working on it.  The woman who organized this conference should have worked with those people.  I see efforts on the part of the professors in my department to bring more women into the field <i>by focusing on the 101 course</i>.  It is not clear which approach works best; some professors have tried making the introductory course more graphics-oriented, theorizing that young women would be drawn to something more visual; others have tried to make the intro course more relevant to fields where women dominate, hoping to make the material more comfortable or familiar to potential dual-majors.  I know one professor whose idea was to make the course more like a math course, with intellectually challenging problems and with the idea that high-school boys are more likely to have spent their time hacking, and thus will have an advantage in any course that is ""hacker oriented"" (and so making a theoretically rigorous course would help level the field).<p>There are probably other approaches that could potentially work better, but the point is this:  the root of the problem is in the lack of women choosing to apply to or enroll in engineering and CS programs.  I saw this problem first-hand as an undergrad (there were <i>no</i> women in my EE class; the department simply had no applicants at all), and I see it now in a CS grad program.  This is not a problem that can be solved by layering more discrimination on top of it; instead, we need to <i>remove</i> the discrimination at the deeper levels.  If women are being turned off the CS by 101 courses, or if they are not even bothering to <i>take</i> 101 courses or even <i>apply</i> to schools with CS programs, <i>that is the problem that must be solved</i>.  I suspect that the ultimate solution will be found in middle school, because that is the age where girls with talent for math and science seem to lose interest in technical fields.",1358824954

I don't know how bad my situation was comparing to some of them described in the comments. I have fought hard to get myself back up. I remember I tried so hard to seek help. Reflecting back, I think I really just wanted a peace of mind knowing that I will get better if I could see a doctor. What horrified me was not what I had to go through. What horrified me is how some people start to treat me afterwards. They would treat me as a mental patient; they would think I am dangerous and crazy.. They also think I probably would be able to achieve anything in life anymore. I feel so sad about this. I have never been treated like this.",1358824139

Comments are not intended to be critical in any way, just trying to give feedback since you asked for it on what would make the site more usable and immediately intuitive as someone not terribly familiar with home-schooling:<p>(1) You have a triple site-title (header, image and main page) which takes up a lot of space. You could also save space up top by pushing the copyright notice to the bottom of the page where it will be less aggressive. The prominence makes me wonder if you are worried about people stealing copy and might be off-putting to casual browsers.<p>(2) It took me a while to figure out what was on the site. Not because your description was wrong or inaccurate, but because the words ""learn"" and ""freedom"" are so generic that the combination didn't provide any substantive clue as to what was on the site until I looked at the site archive. It also made the first paragraph hard to scan. The titles of the subcategories seem vague. ""School is Dead"" is much catchier topic. Perhaps change the intro text to spike the reader's interest? :)<p>(3) CSS recommendations: try bumping up line-height to 1.6 for main text, and decrease both font-size and line height for blockquote elements to make the site more readable, and set quoted passages off from the main text.",1358824096

He/She will also <i>always</i> defend everything Apple does, spinning and twisting every news story to make Apple appear in a positive light and often directly contradict their previous stance, when Apple does something unexpected. These types also collect old Apple computers, like they're trophys, and pay for a cinema ticket to watch a Steve Jobs interview.<p>They glorify Apples quarterly earning report and don't seem to notice that it's actually them paying a $500 profit margin on an iPhone - or maybe they're just happy to do so.<p>I know, because I've met a few in real life, and the worst thing it's completely pointless to discuss anything related to Apples decisions with them - it's like talking against a wall.

Back then, innovation happened at industry research laboratories, the CEO used to be a scientist or engineer, and most important, CEO salaries were lower.  When you ran your company into the ground you&#x27;d be without a golden parachute.  I&#x27;m not convinced at all that Elizabeth Holmes or Carly Fiorina are an improvement over Roy Vagelos or Dave & Bill.  I&#x27;d say that the current system stifles innovation.",1454259596

For instance, the Internet, begun in 1966, took nearly 30 years to become the behemoth force it is now. No single corporation could have pulled it off because of the timeline alone.<p>Consider however that we&#x27;ve been doing this transformation thing since we began as a species.<p><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_dependence</a>",1454259548

He lives in an $8.8 million condo at the Ritz-Carlton residents in downtown LA.<p>Imagine being a broke attractive 18 yr old girl and standing in the atmosphere of a mega glass condo.  There&#x27;s a 50 yro man in good shape and decent looking offering you $1000 for sex.<p>Persuasion is a strange thing.  At 18, you can easily be convinced to do something terrible and then devolve into a full on prostitute.  It&#x27;s a fun and easy life, at first.<p>I specifically asked the Morgan guy not to mess with the girl.  But he couldn&#x27;t help himself.  He sends me a text, &quot;bro can we share her?&quot;, offers her money and she freaks out and leaves.<p>On Halloween, 3 girls from a fashion institute came over before we were going to a party in Malibu.  In 5 minutes, the Morgan Stanley guy tried to weasel his way into their lives.  We left and the next day he asked me for one of their numbers, a very beautiful 18 yr old girl, so he could offer her a &quot;sex scholarship&quot;.<p>Her friend, a 20 yr old girl, has now become the guy&#x27;s personal pimp.<p><i></i>*<p>Years ago I was one of those guys bringing 12 models to the infamous LA pamper parties.  Volleyball, massages, pedicures, fun during the day, and creepy old men orgies at night.<p>Parties hosted by Peter Nygard, who has a 115,000 sqft treehouse island where Barbara and George Bush used to vacation (I took a photo of the photo in Nygard&#x27;s Marina del Ray house.)  I know several models that told me horror stories about the island.<p>Peter tried to put his hand down my friend&#x27;s pants and I stopped him.  We had asked where we could go, and he said &quot;upstairs and I&#x27;ll join you later&quot;.  A 70 yro man who allegedly has HIV wanting to have a threesome with 2 people who are 20?  And we barely talked before he propositioned us.<p>Jeff Greene, billionaire in Beverly Hills and Ivan Wilzig, almost a billionaire in the Hamptons have similar parties.<p>As for the Ritz, the LAPD and the Ritz security said they don&#x27;t want to hear about the drugs and sex crimes of rich people (who can afford lawyers).<p>Matt Bettenhausuen is the Chief Security Officer of AEG.  He was a deputy governor, a federal prosecutor and worked in the White House.<p>Now Matt sells overpriced sugarwater to sports fans and cashes millions in checks from AEG as a result.  Contributing to the obesity epedemic and the general decline of western civilization is his main job, so ignoring sexual predators and money launderers at the Ritz is par for the course.<p>But Matt is a federal prosecutor, so he thought it&#x27;d be smart to harass and intimidate my colleagues in a company I am a partner in.<p>He lied about me, threatened them and in the process committed Obstruction of Justice in regards to a federal investigation of USDA Under Secretary Butch Blazer, BLM Officer Joyce Blazer and DCCC Chairman, Congressman Ben Lujan, in regards to a $44 million weed company called Organic Cannabis Solutions.<p>Lujan was in my unit at the Ritz when OCS weed was there.  His liaison, Juan Buddy Abeyta, is the #3 on OCS.  Emails with Joyce Blazer and files referencing Butch Blazer etc.<p>The principle, Doug Fierro, is the stepson of Butch and son of Joyce.  He stole $500,000 from my roommate and then tried to extort him for $250,000.<p>I protested the extortion and also my roommate was being a super creep to every girl I brought over (and wouldn&#x27;t let me bring guys).<p>Morgan Stanley tried to recruit me, probably because they know I have super rich friends.  But I didn&#x27;t want to work there and so we went from talking about business to him asking me the day befoee I moved out, if I could manage his SeekingArrangement account.<p>He is a full on sociopath.  His girlfriend of 7 years attempted suicide on Oct 20th 2015 and he stopped talking to her (I asked him to please talk to her).<p>He was fired as Executive Director.  He lived with another money launderer and a corrupt psychiatrist, Dr. Rick Jenkins, an obese man who is ignorant of his own biology but an expert in the mysteries of the brain and thus is the largest Adderall prescriber in LA.  He has 3 homes, including the $8.8m condo and 20 cars.<p>And the Ritz HoA President, Kerry Moy, is a 1st Vice President at Morgan Stanley and took a lot of money from a major weed dealer 4 years ago.  So he is yet another money launderer.<p>I was at Morgan&#x27;s offices for 3 weeks.  So much juvenile talk of hookers and blow that it was ridiculous.<p>I despise men who pay for sex.  My spiritual beliefs range to the &#x27;sacred feminine&#x27; and what these men do is utterly destructive, stupid and evil.<p>But no one cares.  &quot;Not my problem.  I don&#x27;t want to lose my job.&quot;",1454259108

These efforts mostly end in failure, usually after a blind hyperparameter search.<p>The easiest way to separate the winners from the losers in deep learning and elsewhere is to ask them to derive the method they are using and explain what it&#x27;s doing.

Obviously, &quot;sugar baby&quot; is not a sexist expression because it is not gendered. As for what it means, to be clear: Alice is Bob&#x27;s sugar-baby (conversely, Bob is Alice&#x27;s sugar-daddy) if Bob is an affluent older person who is both dating the younger Alice and is gifting her with financially-expensive gifts. The gifts could be as immaterial as &quot;I have this car I never drive, you can use it as if it were your own&quot; or as material as &quot;I will pay off your student loan debts.&quot; Usually, if Alice has her own professional career and is providing well for herself, then we&#x27;d not call it a sugar-baby relationship even if the gifts are expensive and one-way. Furthermore if she is taking care of the household and/or kids, that would tend to mollify the judgment. The essence of the judgment is the belief that if the sugar-parent were not providing the gifts to the sugar-baby then the relationship would not persist; the very terms themselves suggest that the relationship is too uncomfortably invoking a parent-child dynamic in a romantic context.<p>A stay-at-home wife is generally not a &quot;sugar baby&quot; since they are married and not dating; you could potentially extend the term to cover married couples but even so, if there are no expensive gifts or they&#x27;re of comparable ages you wouldn&#x27;t normally say that he&#x27;s her sugar-daddy.",1454258434

Most email layouts are a single column or pre-built with a multi-column area. A good editor allows you to add new sections that are single or multi-column.<p>* Responsive by default. For email this means that multi-column layouts can &quot;collapse&quot; to one column on mobile. So a 3x3 grid becomes 1x9 and the content of each cell isn&#x27;t tiny on a phone.<p>* Cross email client compatible. It handle Outlook, GMail and Apple Mail out of the box.

You can host the images yourself, but most of the time that&#x27;s an extra step you don&#x27;t care about.<p>* Allows for saving and re-editing.

No, making roads solar panels is not a good idea. At all. End of story. It&#x27;s always a better idea to spend the money on a solar farm.<p>1. Road surfaces need to be resilient to grit and large trucks driving over them in rain and other shitty conditions. Glass is much softer than rocks, and it will undoubtedly crack eventually in the constant heating and cooling, not to mention tree roots and all the other issues that fuck up asphalt. Not to mention you&#x27;d need to clean (or replace) the panels so often you might as well make the roads out of gold.<p>2. In order to actually get the power from the solar panels, you need an energy grid that is as big as the road network (this isn&#x27;t a big deal for small rollouts, but it is an important note to make). In almost all countries, this is simply impractical (the electricity network is several times smaller than the road network) and would be an enormous waste of money for very little gain.<p>3. Solar panels are already about 30% efficient at best. However, that metric only applies for solar panels being hit with direct sunlight. If you lay your panels flat on the ground (and not on rotating sunflower-like angled panels) you lose yet another third of the amount of energy you could&#x27;ve gained. Why? What was the fucking point of that?<p>TL;DR: Please just build solar farms and stop trying to reuse the road system for something it wasn&#x27;t designed for.

In common speech we use &quot;hair&quot; to refer to refer to hair on a mammal, made primarily of keratin, and to a chitinous seta on an insect.

The executive leadership of this company appears to know nothing about the business they seek to upend.  I am sure the Cleveland Clinic is wondering WTH they got themselves involved with.  Also very telling that Holmes was at Cleveland Clinic the day after this letter was released.<p>They are clearly operating as a bog-standard lab doing conventional testing to be able to report patient results and be a traditional CLIA-certified lab (except may be one test they have - the HSV)  This significant fact seems to have escaped everyone.  They can&#x27;t report any tests performed by their top-secret technology because it ain&#x27;t FDA approved.<p>For a conventional refererence lab like Quest or Labcore, their inspection faults would be embarrasing but fixable.  For Theranos, it&#x27;s likely fixable but the PR fiasco may be ultimately fatal.<p>Someone shoukd really have studied the industry they seek to upturn and worked with real professionals rather than pusing global dominance and glossy PR.  The cart is miles ahead of the horse at Theranos",1454256776

Tablets were a thing, but not big. e-readers were a thing. Phablets were growing in markets like Asia.<p>What if everyone started buying tablets, and used bluetooth headsets to make calls? It seems unlikely that they would completely replace phones, but it could be that people start buying phones that are compatible with their tablets, and Apple would be frozen out.<p>So they brought out the iPad, and no, tablets didn’t replace phones, but Apple made some money and Tim Cook sleeps well at night.<p>Now I think it’s the same thing with watches. It seems unlikely, but one day we might find that all watches can make calls, and Amazon has one that uses voice to buy toilet paper or whatever, and what if people start buying phones that are compatible with their watch instead of watches compatible with their phones?<p>Apple doesn’t want to be frozen out of that game, so here’s a watch, and Apple is making some money, and if watches evolve to become huge, nobody is going to think of Apple has having “missed the boat.”<p>For the market leader, this is their primary imperative: Don&#x27;t miss the boat. They don’t have to win in tablets or watches, they just have to make sure they are strong enough that if the phone business gets disrupted, they can compete. Or if the phones aren’t disrupted, at least make sure that nobody buys a Samsung because “Apple doesn’t make a tablet or watch that works well with an iPhone.&quot;",1454256436

Very few of the young newspaper reporters I used to work with 10 years ago are still in the business, having gone into doing PR or government for saner work hours and much better pay. I can only think of one of my fellow interns who put her years as a beat reporter at a regional paper who successfully made her way to a national outlet. I made the jump myself but only because I was also a programmer. While there are new avenues into big journalism careers, such as blogging or getting your start at places like Vox/BuzzFeed...it doesn&#x27;t seem like the career path from college to small to regional to national paper exists anymore (I&#x27;ve heard the freelancing route has been just as decimated), and the jobs created by online outlets are a fraction of what traditional news outlets used to have.",1454256398

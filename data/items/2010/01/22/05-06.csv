Having a single config flag used to chose which codepath a video went through meant we could launch it for staff only at first. Then, as we rolled it out to more people we could very easily switch to the old codepath if we found issues.<p>We've used flags for changes at all layers within the application code itself - whether to use the more optimized javascript, the new css sprites, the new database access layer, the new database schema, the new spam detection system etc etc.<p>You get even more out of config flags when deploying non-user facing changes - nobody knows if you roll it back so you can turn it off and on as many times as you need to get detailed data on exactly what impact the new code has on your metrics (both business and infrastructure).<p>One thing we don't use flags for is changes in the layers below the application - the OS, web server, php libraries etc. It's much easier to roll these out server by server.",1264139560

Pay could be perfectly fair and people will still be insulted because they don't believe developer X is really better than they are even if everyone else believes so.<p>The only thing I've ever seen that makes people not feel this way is an objective ranking system and pay scale, such as the military.  You pass text X and have Y years in service you get Z dollars, with the test generally meaning more than years in service so as not to prevent stars from rising but still allowing lesser talent to earn rank with time in service.

It is funny how that works, it is rather counter intuitive.<p>And in the second case, I think in the worst case scenario the optimization performs the same number of link followings as the original algorithm. That is because the original algorithm performs duplicative work as the turtle has to follow the same links the hare did.<p>But of course if following a link was that expensive, one would modify the original algorithm to save all the links that the hare traversed so that one does not have to pay for the turtle to follow them. This will result in the original algorithm being faster in certain circumstances than the optimisation (although it may use a bit more memory).<p>Well anyways I was wrong at the top, I am sorry if I offended anyone by stating that they had bugs in their pseudocode. I should not argue with stuff that has been obviously academically developed and argued and double checked to death before i have seen it.",1264136895

1069162,comment,1067815,1068558,0,0,jackpal,,,"A go bencode serialization library could be smaller if it just serialized the bencode data to and from a generic dictionary container. I think another go BitTorrent client, gobit, takes this approach.<p>But it's convenient to be able to serialize arbitrary application types. That makes the bencode library larger because of the need to use go's reflection APIs to analyze and access the application types. Go's reflection APIs are pretty verbose, which is why the line count is so high.<p>To make things even more complicated, the BitTorrent protocol has a funny ""compute-the-sha1-of-the-info-dictionary"" requirement that forces BitTorrent clients to parse that particular part of the BitTorrent protocol using a generic parser.<p>So in the end, the go bencode serializer supports both a generic dictionary parser and an application type parser, which makes it even larger.",1264136628

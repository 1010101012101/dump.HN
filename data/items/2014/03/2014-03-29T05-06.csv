This is entirely supposition and speculation, and I welcome hard evidence on the subject regardless of which way it points..<p>Right now we find ourselves watching vital cornerstone of the Free Internet suddenly ripping itself apart. A community of people who would usually be working on improving (at least attempting to improve) concepts like freedom of speech and publication (press). This is especially important right now, given all of the NSA/Snowden drama of the last year, and the threats they revealed.<p>So I&#x27;m forced to wonder: <i>who&#x27;s the spy trying to wedge the community apart?</i><p>Yes, yes, we&#x27;ve been arguing about sexuality and marriage for a long time, and it should simply be old factions suddenly forced to confront their current situation. Normally, I would simply accept that explanation.<p>However, given that the spy agencies have been using[1] tactics to disrupt groups they see as threatening, I&#x27;m forced to wonder if these new &quot;wedges&quot; between previously-stable communities. Especially in the cases like Mozilla, where and its role on the world stage certainly makes them a target for COINTELPRO or similar attacks.<p>...<p>Because of this worry, I&#x27;m going to suggest something counter to my usual instincts. Being gay myself, I would normally be strongly against Mr. Eich for reasons already said elsewhere. There is a wisdom in picking your battles, and right now there are more important issues.<p>So, instead, I am choosing to see Mr. Eich as a strong ally against greater threats. Marriage rights won&#x27;t easy to fight for if we lose the surveillance/police-state battle first. Emotions are running strong right now - I won&#x27;t deny that the idea of having funded prop 8 does piss me of - but winning one war often means <i>finding allies</i>, even if you don&#x27;t like them.<p>edit: forgot footnote<p>[1]: <a href=""https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipulation/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/02/24/jtrig-manipula...</a>",1396072461

7491543,comment,7491093,7491330,6,0,davidp,,,"There may be a standard project organization that &quot;makes sense&quot; to people familiar with Go, but based on the amount of confusion out there about this, that page is obviously not succeeding in its mission.<p>Consider items like these:<p>> The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your workspace. It is likely the only environment variable you&#x27;ll need to set when developing Go code.<p>> If you keep your code in a source repository somewhere, then you should use the root of that source repository as your base path. For instance, if you have a GitHub account at github.com/user, that should be your base path.<p>> To compile and run a simple program, first choose a package path (we&#x27;ll use github.com/user/hello) and create a corresponding package directory inside your workspace:<p>> $ mkdir $GOPATH/src/github.com/user/hello<p>Keeping the above snippets in mind, here&#x27;s my thought pattern while reading the page:<p>So... I have only one workspace for all my work and I can set GOPATH once, in my .bashrc?  Or I have one workspace per project and I need to set it differently for each project, kind of like a Python virtualenv?  But then what&#x27;s the difference between a &quot;workspace&quot; and a &quot;project&quot;?  I do have a github account with a bunch of different projects -- err, repositories -- so that seems to reinforce the first way, but I don&#x27;t typically work on them at the same time, so why would I combine them into a single Go workspace?  And what&#x27;s a &quot;base path&quot;?  I must have missed that definition... nope, it&#x27;s not in there, ok, I guess it&#x27;s the root of where I&#x27;ll put my... _new_ code?  (Is it going to sync down all my repos?)  But wait, here&#x27;s an example where they say to create a Go &quot;package&quot; directory github.com/user/hello -- AHA! A Go &quot;package&quot; is like a git repository!  Wait, that doesn&#x27;t make sense... I&#x27;m planning to check this whole directory structure into github as a single project -- err, repo.  Or am I not supposed to do that?  But then I&#x27;d have to recreate all this on any machine where I want to work... is that really the intent?  Yep, sure enough, they eventually say I should put the package directory into its own repo.  So yes, I&#x27;m really only supposed to have one workspace for all my Go projects (I think).  I wonder how Go manages dependency isolation for completely unrelated packages -- err, projects? -- that have the same output filename but are in the same workspace?  Anyway, it sure would be nice to have a shell script or something to set up the workspace scaffolding for me, since I&#x27;m not supposed to check it into github...<p>And so we end up with folks like the OP doing exactly that.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a way to beat your head against this stuff until you eventually &quot;get it&quot;, but it ought to be far easier than that to teach people coming from other environments.<p>At the very least, it would be helpful for this page to start by explicitly defining the mappings between the way Go uses words like &quot;workspace&quot;, &quot;package&quot;, &quot;project&quot;, etc. and the way other languages/environments use them.",1396071477

I actually still have a list of the donations, and I covered this topic in my Kickstarter page (which is not yet public).  I probably should have returned the original donations as it was not a huge amount of money, but I was planning to surprise my original backers with something -- cat is out of the bag now I guess.  I still remain friends with many of the original Genesis fans like David Sahlin, Collin Popel, and Seiji Tanaka.<p>My parents were very supportive, but at the same time I had been living with them 8 months post college, and it came to the point where they were hinting more and more that I get a job and move out.  After I launched, it became pretty clear that I was not going to support myself off of Genesis even though the reception was very positive (there was no equivalent of Kickstarter at that point in 2006, unfortunately).  Not more than 2-3 months after launching I got an offer at my the startup my brother worked for (which was not lucrative, just $35k year to work 80 hour weeks). I put in 10,000+ hours of work into Genesis, no one was more disappointed than me to shut it down.  I did what I could and released the source code, hoping that I could return to it later.  I made several attempts over the next couple years to make Genesis-related projects (most of my failed game engines) or make something that could support me to do so.  For the most part, I&#x27;ve been working 80 hours or more trying to make up for it for the past decade.<p>The only situation in which my current project will become vaporware is if I run out of money and have to get another job, and I am really hoping this does not happen because I have put so much work into it again.  Thank you for bringing this up, if I can do anything else to make up for Genesis please let me know.",1396070149

The internal becomes external. The scaffold becomes external. The walls are stripped back and the plumbing is visible, and you might even add some extra scaffolding and pipes that serve no real purpose anymore.<p>Serifs themselves are another example of this phenomenon. When the first &quot;Sans Serifs&quot; were produced, as part of the modernism movement (unlike post modernism, modernism is about stripping back decoration and reducing things to their pure functional nature) they were called &quot;Grotesk&quot;, and the hacker news of the day widely panned them for being useless and illegible and stupid.<p>Now it&#x27;s just boring and normal.<p>In a post modernist web page, every element has border 1px, normally used only for debugging purposes, and a label explaining what type of HTML tag it is and what its attributes are.<p>It&#x27;s a cheeky rebellion against art history.

7491504,comment,7491345,7491345,27,0,tomstokes,,,"Before anyone considers experimenting with Donepezil or other  acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in hopes of enhancing their learning, it should be noted that there are plenty of unknowns and a few serious concerns around altering the cholinesterase levels of otherwise healthy adults.<p>Briefly: Acetylcholinesterase terminates acetylcholine neurotransmission events by deactivating the acetylcholine, allowing it to be reused. An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as the Donepezil used in the article inhibits the action of acetylcholinesterase, which in turn enhances acetylcholine neurotransmission in a dose-dependent manner.<p>Highly potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are used as poisons (Sarin gas, for example) because they interfere with  all of the acetylcholine-based neurotransmission that happens throughout your brain and body. Less potent inhibitors are used at lower doses in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease as it is hoped that they will improve cognitive function and perhaps even slow disease progression. Thus far the results have been mixed.<p>Now the bad news: Cholinergic neurotransmission is widespread through your brain and your body. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are a <i>very</i> blunt and non-specific way to manipulate that neurotransmission. Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t just enhance memory formation and learning related neurotransmission, you amplifiy cholinergic transmission indiscriminately everywhere. As a result, it&#x27;s possible to get some quite negative effects as well. There are reports of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors causing or at least inducing PTSD-like symptoms ( <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17308243"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17308243</a> ). Furthermore, we just don&#x27;t know the long-term effects of these medications on young, healthy adults as they&#x27;ve primarily been studied in elderly populations.<p>In short: It&#x27;s potentially very unwise to use Donepezil or similar medications for the purposes of enhancing your learning or your memory. Leave the experimentation to the carefully controlled studies until more is known on these powerful substances.",1396069931

I haven&#x27;t seen fashion designers catch any flack for preparing separate collections for different genders. It is normal to sometimes seek the company of your own gender, e.g. to have &quot;a ladies night out&quot; - but deliberately inviting only white friends would raise eyebrows, to say the least. Nobody&#x27;s weirded out by a bachelor party, either. There are many gender-related or even gender-exclusive traditions, places, institutions, and businesses.<p>In other words, we aim for a post-racial society, in which race is considered outdated and irrelevant to personal and social relations.

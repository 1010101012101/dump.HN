There was recently discovered a macroscopic bacterium - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomargarita_namibiensis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiomargarita_namibiensis</a> Yes, you can see them with your own eyes.<p>""If the energy-producing machinery straddling the membrane is not constantly fine-tuned, it produces highly reactive molecules that can destroy cells. Yet fine-tuning a larger membrane is problematic because detecting and fixing problems takes longer.""<p>The solution, then is to create short-length response pathways.  Presumably the ""reactive molecule"" they're talking about is superoxide - Life has evolved an incredibly awesome enzyme that takes care of it - superoxide dismutase - and even a slightly defective SOD doesn't lead to inviability.  Certain types of photosynthetic bacteria, which need to ""carefully manage reactivity"" have solved this problem by creating 'hydrogenases' which bleed off excess energy in the form of hydrogen molecules (these may become useful in the alternative fuel industry).<p>""Acquiring mitochondria, it seems, was a one-off event.""<p>Well, no.

Prior to the oxygen catastrophe, mitochondrial cells would have only been able to survive in homeostasis with a cell that was happy to have its poop (oxygen) taken care of locally...  Not to mention that eukarya are generally considered to have branched off of archae...  The specialness of eukarya is that they were a unification of two highly divergent branches of the phylogenetic tree.",1287731480

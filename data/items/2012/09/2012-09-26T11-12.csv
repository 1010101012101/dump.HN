4575134,comment,4561011,4573559,1,0,regularfry,,,"In a hypothetical typical situation, you have the problem that up-front, before anybody has actually done any work, the assumption is that everyone will put in equal effort, so everyone gets equal share locked in from the beginning.  Someone doesn't pull their weight, the shares suddenly look out of whack and people get annoyed.<p>So, you could try the simple fix: a grunt fund calculated on the simple assumption that all hours worked are made equal.  Say one person does 60 hours, the another 40, and you get a 60/40 split.  BUT: the person doing the 40 hours was working on a patent application, and the person who did 60 was just bashing out template HTML.  Not only that, there's a third person who's fronted some cash for a lawyer, and they don't get anything because they're working 16-hour shifts at their day job and haven't put any actual <i>hours</i> in.  The shares look out of whack, and people get annoyed.<p>Next - and this is where my impression of the grunt fund idea comes in - you define an exchange rate between the various types of input up-front, so a 1 hour working on a patent application gains equal share as 5 hours writing HTML, or $100 paid out of pocket.  Everyone is happy, everyone gets a share they feel is proportionate to the value of their input, and everyone's working towards the same ""pay-off"" day.  The question is, what happens when it turns out, say, that they don't need a patent after all?  The patent-writer's work has no value at pay-off day, except in a certain nebulous ""we had to go through that learning to get here"" way.  Not only that, but the HTML-wrangler now has an incentive to get the company to pivot into that situation so that there will be no more patent work, and lots more HTML work.  That's a weird incentive.<p>That's what I mean by the trade-off: in the first case, you have total uncertainty over who's actually going to do what.  In the second case, you have uncertainty over how many hours people are going to work.  In the third case, you have uncertainty over the value of those hours at pay-off day or, to put it another way, you have uncertainty over the accuracy of the exchange rates you define at the start.",1348660383

4575110,comment,4574955,4574955,7,0,ditoa,,,"Well ""slams"" isn't exactly accurate however he is right in saying Windows 8 is still a pretty big work in progress for Microsoft however they had to release this year. It is a stable OS however it is a little schizophrenic to use with the awkward way that Metro (Modern UI) has been crowbarred into it.<p>In my opinion Windows 8 is more of a technology/strategy preview and not a ""real"" Windows release. I have been running the RTM since it hit MSDN and it is fine to use as a primary OS however it isn't all that nice to use as your primary OS. There are so many rough edges and inconsistencys it is quite frustrating to use at times. However this is Microsoft trying to work out how Windows will work on tablet/touch based devices so it is to be expected.<p>Other than developers wanting to get used to some of the new development options available with WinRT and people who want Windows on a tablet and not iOS or Android I don't see any real reasons to upgrade from Windows 7. Especially as Windows 7 is a nicer experience for desktop/laptop users IMHO.",1348659868

By the time that your system is in the 5% of cases, you're looking at a massive rearchitecting effort.<p>Of course, to be fair, you're probably already looking at a rearchitecting effort at this point!<p>However, looking at the architecture diagram, much of the complexity could be hidden behind the scenes with a devoted toolset built on top of Postgres, rather than trying to cobble together Kafka, Thrift, Hadoop, and Storm. 
Sometimes, one big tool beats a lot of small tools.<p>For that matter, I wonder if a series of Postgres-XC (or Storm) servers couldn't do the same thing without learning a series of complex tools.<p>Step 1: Everything goes through a stored procedure. Deletes, updates, and creates are code generated through a DSL. Migrations would be a pain under this system, but mitigated by the fact that the complexity is being handled by the tool.<p>This stored procedure then writes to the database of record and then sends a series of updates to, essentially a system of real-time materialized views that serve the same purpose as the standard NoSQL schema.<p>The lambda architecture purposes would still be fulfilled with lower data-side complexity. After I read through Big Data I'll revisit this with a more nuanced view, but I wonder if hadoop and nosql really give you anything.",1348658832

If you have a system capable of streaming all the events and writing out the reporting views, why not use it for everything.<p>At my previous^2 job, we had a distributed event store that captured all data and could give you all events (or events matching a very limited set of possible filters) either in a given time range, or streaming from a given time onwards. For any given view we'd have four instances of the database containing it, populated their own streaming inserters; if we discovered a bug in the view creation logic, we'd delete one database and re-run the (newly updated) inserter until it caught up, then repeat with the others (queries automatically went to the most up to date view, so this was transparent to the query client - they'd simply see bugged data (some of the time) until all the views were rebuilt).<p>The events system guaranteed consistency at the cost of a bit of latency (generally <1 second in practice, good enough for all our query workloads); if an event source hard-crashed then all event streams would stop until it was manually failed (ops were alerted if events got out of date by more than a certain threshold). This could also happen if someone forgot to manually close the event stream after taking a machine out of service (but at least that only happened in office hours); hard-crashes were thankfully pretty rare. Rebuilding the full view after discovering a bug was obviously quite slow, but there's no way to avoid that (and again this was quite rare).<p>In use it was a very effective architecture; we handled consistency of the events stream in one place, and building the view in another. We only had to write the build-the-view code once, we only had one view store and one event store to maintain. And we built it all on mysql.",1348657407

I think this would work because the community is fairly observant of the rules. Plus you could shape behavior by suggesting certain tags when the user wants to add a new tag to a submission. On top of covering the use cases you detail, it would:<p>1) Help with search if it is ever implemented<p>2) Allow users to quickly disseminate the subject of articles on the front page without ever opening them (especially helpful for ambiguous titles)<p>3) Maybe in the future allow users to subscribe/unsubscribe to certain tags if the front page starts getting too busy",1261346371

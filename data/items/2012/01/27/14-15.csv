3518450,comment,3517329,3518328,6,0,jules,,,"I have seen some of da Vinci's paintings in real life. Among them his famous Mona Lisa. I didn't find them particularly extraordinary among the other paintings in the Louvre, though I already said that he was a good painter.<p>What are his important discoveries in anatomy, optics and civil engineering? What did da Vinci discover about optics that Euclid hadn't already discovered 1700 years earlier? It seems to me that his contribution in those fields is mainly as an illustrator. Which of his ""inventions"" actually worked? How do you explain his nonsense engineering like flying machines?<p>Perhaps the case that da Vinci was an illustrator-wannabe-scientist/engineer is overstating it a bit. I'm not saying he made no contributions whatsoever, just that there are other people far more deserving of the deification that Leonardo da Vinci enjoys, like Newton, Galilei, Gauss, etc.<p>When people talk about da Vinci's contributions they always talk in vague terms. Now take Newton and we can easily find numerous contributions that are still extremely important even in our age:<p>* Calculus - the basis of physics, engineering, and a large part of practical mathematics<p>* Newton's laws of motion<p>* Newton's law of gravity<p>* Major contributions to optics<p>* Newton's method - one of the most important algorithms<p>The trouble with these is that they require far more effort and study to appreciate compared to a bunch of drawings, especially if you don't try to look critically at the drawings and try to determine whether the machines depicted actually work.",1327676270

Some can be approximated with a software-only approach, provided that the content provider wants to not only take the time to implement, but also wants consumers to continue to have those benefits.  There are also properties of physical media that are impossible to duplicate with the internet, and what they do provide relies on them never going offline and never stop serving any each and every piece of content.<p>I have NES cartridges in my closet that are much more versatile than games on steam.  I have a netflix streaming account that I _can not_ use when I visit my father because he doesn't have an internet connection and I can't cache netflix movies on my laptop.  I have a friend, who because of hardware failure, can only use xbox dlc if he is connected to the internet (I don't really know the DRM specifics, but on the original hardware he didn't need to be connected).<p>I put up with some of these limitations because I hope they are temporary and digital distribution companies will eventually get their act together, but they're still a ""last resort"" option when I buy media.",1327676218

In surveys, Microsoft is deemed ""competitive"", ""best-in-class"" and so on (by the masses).  But the tech who have to administrate it prefer Linux.  Windows caused them some huge headaches in the nineties.  Now, starting about 2002 a lot of these same Linux-using tech guys switched over to Macs as a Unix.  As Apple grew and grew, it did not completely piss off these same people.  Now the Mac is becoming walled-off, but Apple gets a pass from these same sys admin type people where Microsoft doesn't.<p>I agree with you that Windows means huge productivities for millions of businesses, and also that Macs really resonate with huge numbers of people, also millions.

The reply button wasn't showing.<p>Anyway, that 150-160 hours was to the point where I was comfortable enough to sit down and code away. I'm still working on the system and I'm still learning a lot. I'd also like to become a lot better with css/jquery. I know the basics and not much more. A guy on my team is a front end whiz so I don't have to worry about cramming that into my head right now.",1327672953
3518271,comment,3518059,3518059,1,0,saltcod,,,"Fantastic post. Thanks so much for it. I decided to really dig into Ruby on Rails after Christmas this year, after thinking/talking about it for years. I was thrilled to hear that you really had no programming backgroundI think a lot of us are in this boat.<p>I watched the Lynda.com videos on Ruby, and the one on Ruby on Rails (both from Kevin Skoglund). I just watched enough of both to get fairly overwhelmed and confused, then moved on to Michael Hartl's site. Things started to click much better therethat's the best Rails resource I've seen to date.<p>Still though, After really digging in over the evenings and two weekends, that nagging feeling started to set inam I actually going to 'get' this? Am I wasting my time? Is this going to take years? Will I ever get past layouts/partials? Should I just go learn PHP / Javascript / iOS / something else?<p>Did you feel like giving up? Or question the purpose/wisdom of learning Ruby and Rails?",1327672942

I get a lot out of interacting with the people that actually use my software. It makes things more personal and that makes me more motivated to work on a project. And the feedback helps to make what they actually want instead of having to second-guess, or build to some abstract specs.<p>That the project is technically interesting/challenging also goes a long way, of course, but that's not everything.<p>Worst would be a project that is boring <i>and</i> you don't know whether anyone, including yourself, is ever going to use it.",1327672896

For much of this, we can thank the loosening standards imposed over the past two decades by a specialized patent appeals court that has given overblown...<p>> No, this is just a common misconception. If you look at the history of rulings from east Texas, you will see they invalidate a higher percentage of patents than other courts in the US.<p>The &quot;specialized patent appeals court&quot; that GP is referring to as having imposed &quot;loosening standards&quot; over the past two decades is certainly the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, not the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, for the following reasons:<p>1. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas is a trial court, not an appeals court,<p>2. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas is a <i>regular</i> federal court, not a <i>specialized</i> patent court (even if it may have attracted some attention because of patent litigation that has gravitated there),<p>3. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is an appeals court, not a trial court,<p>4. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is unique among the Circuit Courts of Appeals in that it has national jurisdiction for appeals of certain classes of cases (including, notably, patent cases) based on subject matter.<p>So, however interesting your essay on the merits of the patent procedures of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas might be, it really is completely irrelevant to the post you are responding to, which wasn&#x27;t talking about that court at all.",1388188778

From what I understand there has always been someone who had more control over property than another.<p>Who will redistribute in a practical way?  Who watches that person to make sure they are both efficient and fair?<p>Also - look at a list of the richest people in America.  You&#x27;ll notice that most came from middle or low class backgrounds.  It seems like redistribution occurs fairly rapidly (within one or two generations) compared with other times.<p>Also - please explain who in America has massively unequal bargaining powers?<p>In another comment you said you needed to use &quot;counter propoganda&quot;.  The internet and forums are largely dominated by your way of thinking. Maybe it&#x27;s because people who hold your view would rather type about issues than do solid work.<p>And I&#x27;ve also been thinking about this practically.  It is right that claims on property, the foundation of many forms of capitalist forms of economies, are not inherent.  However couldn&#x27;t powerful property taxes be useful as this?  If we defined property well and taxed ownership then redistribution would be built in and taxes would fall on the richest (those who use the most resources)?  I&#x27;m just playing with that idea.<p>Also - there is one prominent example of someone living on $7,000 a year comfortably (early retirement extreme) which is far below the minimum wage.  This person lives a lifestyle far better than almost anyone two generations ago and most a generation ago.",1388188626

(It&#x27;s still pretty funny to me either way.)<p>I am dead serious.<p>> Haskell tries to be a language where all code only does this: Take input, produce output from it; whenever input is the same, output needs to be the same, nothing else may happen, no exceptions whatsoever. Since this forbids things like printing to the screen, reading from a network connections and other useful things, there needed to be a single construct that is excempt from these rules, so Haskell can be useful. Monads are these constructs.<p>Stop conflating monads with IO. Monads just <i>happen</i> to be usable for modeling IO, but they can model other things as well.<p>> Monads are the house rules you bring to your Monopoly game to make it fun.<p>Ironically, when I program in Haskell, I try to keep as much stuff outside of IO as possible. The reason is precisely that IO is usually not fun.<p>> (Yes, that means Haskell is not a fully functional language, it&#x27;s just more functional than most.)<p>No, it just means that IO is a DSL for constructing imperative programs functionally.<p>===<p>Anyway, I have no desire for being trolled, so this discussion ends here.",1388188265

I was asked to carry out SSD analysis with some very specific criteria: budget below £100, size greater than 16Gbytes and Power-loss protection mandatory. This was almost an impossible task: after months of searching the shortlist was very short indeed. There was only one drive that survived the torturing: the Intel S3500. After more than 6,500 power-cycles over several days of heavy sustained random writes, not a single byte of data was lost. Crucial M4: failed. Toshiba THNSNH060GCS: failed. Innodisk 3MP SATA Slim: failed. OCZ: failed hard. Only the end-of-lifed Intel 320 and its newer replacement, the S3500, survived unscathed. The conclusion: if you care about data even when power could be unreliable, only buy Intel SSDs.&quot;<p>Source: <a href=\"http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/12/27/208249/power-loss-protected-ssds-tested-only-intel-s3500-passes\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/13/12/27/208249/power-los...</a>",1388188241

The few that <i>do</i> eventually go off are likely to injure uninvolved parties who didn&#x27;t see what they were stepping on -- people and companies who may not even have been born when you tightened the last screw.

They are very likely to sell your handiwork to someone else, perhaps under financial or legal duress.  This may happen several times before the explosives in your creation decay into harmlessness.  Chances are, any influence you may have when you manufacture your mine will only diminish with time.  It is not only possible but likely that what you are building will fall into the hands of people whose interests and values are far removed from your own.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s unlikely that you will be the one who eventually steps on your own mine.

Right now you either renew it online from home or wait in a ridiculously long line to talk to a human.

I don&#x27;t really see why DMV employees can&#x27;t be remotely located and have a TV monitor and less employees at the location.<p>The other inventions were spot on for the most part. Probably because the ideas are fairly easy, it&#x27;s the execution and bringing to market that are difficult. The components and infrastructure just wasn&#x27;t there to make a lot of those things happen without the internet, which was not as common as it is now (20 years later). The internet will continue to change the way we live, there are still lots of potential to better automate processes and make the world more efficient. It&#x27;s getting kind of hard to imagine the next 20 years though. We&#x27;ve come so far in the past 20 that the things that are left are the really hard problems (space travel, re-arranging molecules and atoms at will, advanced medicine).<p>One problem with a more efficient and automated world is the loss of jobs. Hopefully all of this innovation will also create as many jobs as it removes. Then we can also start moving towards a post-scarcity society, like socialism but more of a Utopian society that will actually work. We just need molecular re-arrangers to be as common as a printer and BAM, then the only things we will have to worry about are running out of land and accidentally creating a virus, parasite, or robot that kills everyone.",1388186486

One incident where someone was charged several hundred dollars for what amounted to a cab ride home to from a bar and another where an uber rider left their cell phone in the car.

Technology extends and scales human ability. But the onus is still on people to use technology morally, ethically & responsibly. The double edge on technology&#x27;s sword is that not all people make choices with morals or ethics in mind. So, is a technology provider responsible for self policing their platform?

6973041,comment,6972154,6972564,1,0,Dewie,,,"I find the Spotify Android app to be a pain. I just opened it and it took literally around 15 seconds to show my playlists. I kind of have a good amount of playlists, but that is basically the only way I&#x27;ve found to keep track of things I want to listen to with the exception of starring (so yay for having an unholy mess of playlists for which there doesn&#x27;t to be anything like filtering or what have you for actually dealing with a large amount of playlists manageable). And there is no obvious way of having different playlists for mobile and Desktop/browser, although I only want some playlists for mobile so that I can use them offline. Some times it also takes literally 30 seconds to load a playlist that I&#x27;ve selected, and up to 12 seconds from starting a song until it actually plays. There is also no way for me to turn off 3G streaming SPECIFICALLY, so it&#x27;s either offline mode or I have to be careful not to play a playlist with some offline tracks if I happen to not get WiFi unexpectedly for some reason (and WiFi goes out unexpectedly and without warning because wireless is volatile like that, plus no app ever will tell you that you have no WiFi specifically, it will just say &quot;No Internet&quot;). Also a lot of nuisance with Spotify claiming that I&#x27;m &quot;offline&quot; when I know that I clearly am not, though that has gotten a lot better. Desktop Spotify is totally fine, though. But right now I&#x27;m really craving going back to a 16 GB iPod Nano when it comes to listening to music wherever I want. Downloading and &quot;undownloading&quot; and the clusterfuck of playlists is just a big hassle for something that is supposed to be a lot more convenient than an mp3 player.<p>They also used to have a horrific splash webpage with autoplay IIRC, but thankfully they seem to have changed that.<p>Maybe there is some obvious way to fix all of this such as by reinstalling the Android app (did that about half a year ago I guess) or googling (though I&#x27;ve been mostly dissapointed when googling issues, ending up at the Spotify communit/support forum and basically finding out &quot;yeah that&#x27;s not possible/you have to do this tedious work-around&quot;), but I mostly wrote this because I saw the opportunity to vent, so...<p>EDIT: Also, when I first wanted to use the browser version, the actual webpage/URL for the player was so hard to find it was almost as if they tried to make it a secret on purpose. But I&#x27;m happy that there even is a browser player in addition to the desktop app. And the Linux version of the Desktop app is very good (on Ubuntu at least) so I don&#x27;t need to use Wine.",1388185691

When you negotiate your initial salary, you are at a disadvantage because you have less information than the employer. At the start of your career you have very little information about the job market and what your position is worth to a future employer. Your initial salary is often the base for future income.<p>There&#x27;s obvious problems when people don&#x27;t know how much they should be paid. I need only point to the history behind the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 as a real-world example.<p>Moreover, public salary information is not inherently corrosive to a job environment.

This would be an example of a process of &quot;discovery&quot; about a character, but this discovery is happening in the form of revelations in the text rather than by the act of the author.<p>If you wanted to make the analogy more precise, you could imagine a character created with peculiar traits, and the author later realizes a single explanation for those traits which they had not originally conceived, which they then write into a story.  In these two cases, the effect on the reader might be identical, but in one essential information about the character was held back and in one it was developed later.<p>All of this is a little academic, though, since none of the information about Holmes & Watson in the post-1923 stories has a material effect on their characters, as ACD&#x27;s estate attempted to argue.",1388185627

Also, nobody was sure what networking protocols would become popular (IP? OSI? XNS?) so a lot of work went into making everything as flexible as possible.  This reached an apogee with AT&T&#x27;s &quot;STREAMS&quot; subsystem (a competitor to the sockets API for writing networking code on UNIX) which was very flexible but also extremely complicated.<p>What Van Jacobson&#x27;s work was saying is &quot;look guys: by paying close attention to the fastpath you <i>can</i> saturate your 10Mbps network with TCP traffic&quot;  I&#x27;m sure everybody who has written a TCP stack has seen this email and has taken the tricks to heart.<p>These days not all of the tweaks might be still relevant.

If you look at the history of rulings from east Texas, you will see they invalidate a higher percentage of patents than other courts in the US.  East Texas just implemented rules on length of filings and length of arguments to cut out most of the crap out of patent cases, making the process cheaper and faster for both sides.<p>So, if you have an iffy patent, and you want to have the best odds of winning, don&#x27;t file in east Texas.  But expect to pay a lot more.<p>I guess the east Texas model is bad for lawyers who file thousands of pages of &quot;supporting material&quot;, and then get paid $200/hr to read it.

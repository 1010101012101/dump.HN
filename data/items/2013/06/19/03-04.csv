Simone Gordon described meetings where managers created quotas for lower-level employees, and a bonus system for reaching those quotas. Employees who placed ten or more accounts into foreclosure in a given month received a $500 bonus, Gordon wrote. Bank of America also gave employees gift cards to retail stores like Target or Bed Bath and Beyond as rewards for placing accounts into foreclosure. Employees were closely monitored, and those who didnt meet quotas, or who dared to give borrowers accurate information, were fired, as was anyone who questioned the ethics  of declining loan modifications for false and fraudulent reasons, according to William Wilson.",1371614359

5903633,comment,5903372,5903372,6,0,yareally,,,"Like the author, I&#x27;ve been using Scala more and more as of late (mostly after finding it to be a viable alternative to Java on Android). Perhaps the biggest thing that I&#x27;ve had to get over is the &quot;feature freedom&quot; of the language after being walled in by Java on Android. I know I&#x27;m not too far off in saying it, but it&#x27;s like Martin Odersky created it in direct response to the nanny-like restrictiveness that Java has, but perhaps went too far in some areas (as the article describes a bit). He did write the current java compiler, so he&#x27;s well familiar with how Java is. I just sometimes get the feeling someone pressed accept to every feature enhancement to the language at some point as just about any feature you can think of in a modern language has found its way into Scala. Generally, I find that to be a good thing, but I can see how it would be off-putting to some and makes Scala somewhat of a controversial language for both imperative and functional language advocates.<p>If one is not careful and adhering to a formal style guide, it would easy to end up with an unreadable mess of inconsistent code. Anyone with some grounding in programming already at a professional level shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, but someone that&#x27;s relatively new to development might want to look into another language. For example, all of these are valid ways to create a class with some parameters/properties:<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/yareally/5811498"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/yareally/5811498</a><p>After having to use Java on Android for the past three years, such freedom is both liberating and shocking at the same time. I use C#, JavaScript and Python pretty frequent as well, but it&#x27;s just I&#x27;d say Scala is even more liberal than any of those feature wise. It&#x27;s more like Perl (not quite, but close), but not quite in the area of a Lisp variant. Scala is definitely written from the viewpoint of the developer and not the intended users though. It&#x27;s also nice to have access to features that are standard in languages like Python, Ruby, C# and functional languages. Seeing 13 lines of Java become 1 line of Scala[1] is a great feeling.<p>I&#x27;d say if you have experience with Java, C#, Python, Ruby or any functional language you&#x27;ll pick up on Scala pretty quick. If Java is your only language experience, it might be a bit rough at first, because of the expressiveness and freedom of the language, but don&#x27;t let it detour you. If needed, you can mostly stick to the imperative side of Scala and slowly work in more functional features as well as some of the useful syntactical sugar stuff (like operator overloading) that Scala provides.<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/yareally/5810767"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/yareally/5810767</a>",1371613197

PRISM, a subsystem of collection management mission application, is a Web-based management and synchronization tool used to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of theater operations. PRISM creates a collaborative environment for resource managers, collection managers, exploitation managers, and customers. In joint collection management operations, the collection manager coordinates with the operations directorate to forward collection requirements to the component commander exercising tactical control over the theater reconnaissance and surveillance assets. A mission tasking order goes to the unit responsible for the collection operations. At the selected unit, the mission manager makes the final choice of platforms, equipment, and personnel required for the collection operations based on operational considerations such as maintenance, schedules, training, and experience. The Air Force uses the collection management mission application. This application is a Web-centric information systems architecture that incorporates existing programs sponsored by several commands, Services, and agencies.

Interesting idea, but not safe. All that&#x27;s needed is an algorithm that finds the object existing in both images.

If you try a more rigorous system, where there&#x27;s two pictures full of images in both, then you might have a better chance. But you&#x27;ll still be giving text instructions to specify <i>which</i> image is the one you need to trace, and this can be automated as stated above.

You could specify nothing, and instead tell the human to trace two matching objects. Regardless of whether or not there&#x27;s more than one matching set, you can still automate this and pass with a machine.<p>I think this is an interesting, and perhaps capable idea, but it&#x27;s far away from having any practical or secure utility.",1371611647

You basically have to be willing to devote your life to journalism if you want to break in. Treat it like it&#x27;s medical school or law school.\n2.) When interviewing for a job, tell the editor how you love to report. How your passion is gathering information. Do not mention how you want to be a writer, use the word &quot;prose,&quot; or that deep down you have a sinking suspicion you are the next Norman Mailer.\n3.) Be prepared to do a lot of things for free. This sucks, and it&#x27;s unfair, and it gives rich kids an edge. But it&#x27;s also the reality.\n4.) When writing for a mass audience, put a fact in every sentence.\n5.)Also, keep the stories simple and to the point, at least at first.\n6.) You should have a blog and be following journalists you like on Twitter.\n7.) If there&#x27;s a publication you want to work for or write for, cold call the editors and/or email them. This can work.\n8) By the second sentence of a pitch, the entirety of the story should be explained. (In other words, if you can&#x27;t come up with a rough headline for your story idea, it&#x27;s going to be a challenge to get it published.)\n9) Mainly you really have to love writing and reporting. Like it&#x27;s more important to you than anything else in your life--family, friends, social life, whatever.\n10) Learn to embrace rejection as part of the gig. Keep writing/pitching/reading.",1371611341

5903534,comment,5897458,5898270,1,0,dsuth,,,"That&#x27;s interesting. I&#x27;m fairly sure I played on Hard, although this was years ago so my memory may be rusty. Some parts of the game were definitely &#x27;hard&#x27;, but seemed artificially so. Like the last boss eschewing all of the tactics learned prior to it, or a generically drawn &#x27;maze&#x27; level which was just confusing for the sake of filling in game time.<p>My main gripe with this game, and others like it, is that even if the difficulty can be ratcheted up, the result is not engaging gameplay. It doesn&#x27;t generally require more skill, or novel tactics, or using the right tool for the job, just better timing or more patience. This is the point I was trying to make, although sloppily.<p>Well-design hard games draw you in with the surprising complexity of thought or skill required to beat their challenges, hidden under a deceptively simple surface. For example Monster Hunter&#x27;s weapons involve maybe 3 or 4 combos, whereas God of War&#x27;s had more than I could easily memorise. But using combos in GoW didn&#x27;t matter anyway because just mashing the buttons had the same effect. Using the wrong combo in MH will likely leave you exposed to a brutal attack, a quick death, and a long walk (or simple failure of the mission, goodbye 50 minutes of game time, you get nothing). Same story in Dark Souls, except you <i>might</i> be able to fight your way back to reclaim the stuff you lost. You really need to <i>think</i> about how you&#x27;re attacking things, what your positioning is, what you&#x27;re attacking etc etc. That is the complexity underneath the &#x27;simple&#x27; combat systems that makes these games <i>engagingly difficult</i>.",1371611276

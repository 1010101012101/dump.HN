I worked for 3 companies as a dev in about 6 years of experience, I always left because I wanted to move to something &quot;more&quot;, not because I didn&#x27;t care or didn&#x27;t feel included. In all 3 I had a seemingly open space and I really like it if I have space to breath.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s about not caring or mattering, actually, the open space environment originated to fight that feeling of being nobody, alone in your cubicle. What open space is trying to achieve is showing that everyone is, at least theoretically, on the same level.<p>Ultimately, I like it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s perfect and it will probably change.

The article might want to mention what you should do if you find a vuln.<p>The first thing to do is to check whether the company has any disclosure programs set up.  This is somewhat rare, but companies are starting to pay regular bounties for this type of thing:  <a href=""https://hackerone.com/hacktivity"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackerone.com/hacktivity</a><p>If there&#x27;s no program in place, contact a pentester and ask how to proceed.  There are a variety of pentesters available on Twitter who will absolutely jump at the chance, so if you&#x27;re looking for a way to responsibly disclose a bug, that&#x27;s one way to do it.  If you&#x27;re worried they might try to claim credit, well... Don&#x27;t worry about that.  No one&#x27;s interested in tanking their own reputation by pulling a stunt like that.  The discovery is much more valuable to you than to them.<p>What you should <i>not</i> do is continue to probe the vulnerability beyond what you initially discovered.  E.g. if you got access to a server somehow, disconnect and seek a way to responsibly disclose the vuln.  Don&#x27;t try to see how deeply you can breach, and don&#x27;t run commands to poke around at their data.<p>If you&#x27;re a teenager, there are pretty much two options:  Show the vuln to your friends, or try to disclose the vuln responsibly.  Showing it off is usually a bad idea.  They&#x27;ll probably pressure you to show off, which makes disclosure a little more difficult.  The cred you get won&#x27;t matter long-term.  But impressing your peers is a pretty powerful force to try to persuade against in an HN comment.  Whatever you do, don&#x27;t tell anyone but a pentester any specific steps to replicate your finding, else you&#x27;ll be on the hook for whatever silly thing they do.<p>Your vuln may seem very important, and maybe it is.  But you&#x27;re also usually the first one to run across it.  Even if it takes 17 months to resolve an issue, companies in the current social climate are almost all willing to work with you to get it done.  This is where contacting a pentester can help, because they can contact the company on your behalf, or at least advise you about what to say when you contact them.  Again, don&#x27;t worry about them claiming credit; they have no interest in such things.<p>The article raises a few points I&#x27;ll pass on addressing.  I wanted to give a perspective on how to disclose a vuln that you stumble across.<p>Emphasis on &quot;stumble across.&quot;  The world is in a strange state right now where it&#x27;s not really a good idea to go looking for flaws unless a company is actively asking you to seek them out, like Twitter.",1448962270

The second time, this effect is about 100 times stronger than usual, so 10 times less strong than the first time.\nThen you want to go back to that first unbelievable fantastic time, and take more. You may get at 200, but the more often you take it, the less the effect, and the stronger the craving for it.

But more importantly, tools depending on proprietary platforms usually have a short life. For example people loved Mailbox from Dropbox, while I was the one complaining that it only works with Gmail and iCloud. And I was right, Mailbox is dying.<p>And also these tools get access to all of your email, which is a privacy concern. And in the context of a company, that can mean industrial espionage.

I went to change a recurring cleaning schedule and they presented me with a modal pop-up to keep my cleanings at 50% off. I agreed, and my future cleaning pricing all showed up at $43/cleaning.<p>My next cleaning comes around, and I&#x27;m hit with a $101 charge. The receipt literally says &quot;Price: $101, Discount: $58, Total Charged: $101&quot;. I end up having to go back and forth over Twitter DM because they refuse to respond to my emails and pick up their phone to get my charge adjusted. I ask if the remaining three cleanings that I was signed up for would honor the $43 price reflected in my account summary. They said yes.<p>The day before the next cleaning, I get hit with the same $101 charge. Again, I reach out to them and spend about three hours going back and forth finding out that the &quot;last representative did not provide the right information&quot;, and that I need to &quot;show the coupon code (I) used&quot; (there wasn&#x27;t one). I ended up getting my service cancelled for good.<p>Terrible. Never again. I&#x27;d rather pay a premium for a real cleaner to show up.",1445900370

10455094,comment,10434726,10452184,0,0,jsprogrammer,,,"Sure. I&#x27;m actually reading through (a translation of) The Logic of Scientific Discovery right now, but I am already familiar with the ideas, conclusions, etc of Popper, Godel, and others whom have done related work.<p>However, mathematical induction is different from &quot;inductive reasoing&quot; (as opposed to deductive, or &quot;the deductive theory of testing&quot;, as Popper&#x27;s translators call it). In fact, I don&#x27;t believe it is a contrast to Popper&#x27;s work; mathematical induction is actually a form of deductive reasoning (of course, this makes it rather confusing to talk about). Popper&#x27;s method requires first formulating a system (axioms) in pure mathematics (logic). Then deriving the logical conclusions from the system and determining tests that could be performed that could contradict those conclusions. Popper also provides a schema for comparing systems, deriving contradictory conclusions, and designing experiments to distinguish between the various theories under consideration.<p>>The way this works is:<p>I don&#x27;t mean to be obtuse, but it&#x27;s not immediately clear to me at the moment what &quot;this&quot; refers to (although, from the context of the prior post, I would assume it refers to Inter-universal Teichmuller Theory). Is there another way you could clarify what we are talking about?<p>Edit: Ok, I read my last post again and I think maybe you are giving a physical theory that is not based on integers or number theory? My concern with that interpretation is that I&#x27;m not sure how meaningful of a distinction can be made between Integers, ZFC, or Logic within the context of physical theories. Doesn&#x27;t Shannon&#x27;s work allow us to collapse all writable (a necessary precondition to execute Popper&#x27;s method) theories to integers?",1445900298

(Think of &quot;Jersey barriers&quot; lined up in a construction zone through which a zebra crossing lies. That&#x27;s an easy abutment scenario and striking a line of Jersey barriers end-on at 30mph provides a deceleration approximately equal to a 30 mph head-on collision with an opposite direction car of equal mass also traveling at 30 mph. That&#x27;s going to be a massive shunt.)<p>I agree there&#x27;s an overhyping in the title, &quot;programmed to kill&quot;, but the decision of &quot;cause a near-certain harm to a pedestrian&quot; vs &quot;cause the car to leave the known roadway and suffer/inflict unknown and unknowable harm&quot; is a very legitimate concern.<p>(I worked as an intern for Daimler on a completely autonomous bus. Our only fallback was &quot;mash the red E-stop button [shutting off the computer servos] and manually take over&quot;, so we literally never let the vehicle exceed what the human safety driver was comfortable with, but eventually that&#x27;s going to go away for fully autonomous vehicles.)",1445900136

My current freelance project sees me working in a room with 20 people, lined up on long desks (not even Cubicles). After a while, it can get a bit smelly. There are 4 women and 16 men working in the room, and to be honest I wonder why the women put up with it (they are not developers, either).<p>That kind of setup is not uncommon. I have been asked to work in windowless rooms, which I rejected. I have worked in ugly industrial areas and ugly buildings. I have worked in the basement that wasn&#x27;t officially suitable for human use (only legal for storage).<p>After 6 hours, my eyes hurt from the strain of looking at HTML and Javascript all day, trying to find tiny mistakes in the source code. But I have at least 2 more hours to go.\nHuman interaction is minimal - yes there are meetings, but that is not the same as human interaction that for example a doctor sees.<p>Sure, jobs at Google or Facebook might be fancy. But even at big companies (including Google) I have seen those big open plan offices. They just had more colorful toys lying around at Google. And most devs won&#x27;t work for Facebook or Google.<p>Why do I put up with it? Because I need the money to feed my family, and I can not easily switch to another profession. This is probably controversial and will give me downvotes, but most women don&#x27;t need to work to feed their family - their husbands do that. So they are not forced to put up with smelly, crowded, windowless rooms for years and years on end. And women can easily switch profession, too: they can simply become mothers, which 40% choose to do (become fulltime moms, that is - more women become mothers of course).<p>I enjoy programming for my own projects, but most dev jobs I did for money were gruesome.<p>Note that this gruesomeness affects women and men in the same way. There are no offensive Star Wars posters or other Geeky things lining the walls. The environments just tend to be less comfy, because devs only stare into their computers anyway.<p>The notion always seems to be that the women who shy away from tech end up leading &quot;wasted&quot;, brainless lives as housewives. Not so. They become doctors, or journalists, or liberal arts people (and btw., housewive and spending time with your kids is not all that bad either).<p>I understand if companies want to lure women into tech, because it gives them a greater talent pool and lower wages (because of greater supply).

I don&#x27;t need it anymore.<p>Furthermore, they&#x27;re doing the typical thing that businesses resort to when they&#x27;re desperate. They&#x27;re asking you to review every single damn time you use their service. (I had the same sitter for 30 weeks in a row. Clearly I like her or I&#x27;d use someone different. Stop bugging me!)<p>They also try to steer you towards using their service more when there&#x27;s no need for it. Every time I book a stay, they want me to look into other pet sitters on their site. Why would I do that? I&#x27;m completely happy with the one I found. If I ever need a change because I move or the sitter moves, or we have a falling out, I&#x27;ll consider looking for a new one. Until then, get out of my face!<p>And on top of it, they&#x27;re trying to push services I don&#x27;t need. I never want someone to come to my house to walk my dog. I don&#x27;t need strangers coming by my house. And I need an overnight maybe 3 times a year. (And I&#x27;ll continue to use the day sitter I have as they also do overnights.) It&#x27;s almost impossible to find a day sitter on rover.com, and they seem to be pushing everything <i>but</i> that.<p>Their whole model seems like it&#x27;s living on borrowed time to me.",1445896871

Generally this works by avoiding single large assembly points, putting entrances and exits such that there&#x27;s no through transit of a space or building, and otherwise dispersing the energy of crowds.<p>2. Las Vegas. The manipulation is so grossly apparent to me that the entire place disgusts me. Windowless interiors, no clocks, bright lights and flashing displays, loud music. And, most iconically: moving walkways to take you <i>into</i> casinos, but having to depart under your own power.<p>3. Much of air safety practices. While it&#x27;s not possible to design out pilot (or other human) error, you <i>can</i> become <i>highly</i> aware of what leads to accidents.

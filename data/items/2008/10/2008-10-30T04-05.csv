And it suggests that there probably isn't a strong case to be made for the official procedures to be workable for them, and they may have already tried it and failed.  I suspect they didn't sue first--that's a very big weapon to fire as an opening salvo.  Though, I guess it does happen.",1225340597

348417,comment,347322,348304,0,0,thwarted,,,"One of the best ways to learn is to take a risk or know someone who takes a risk.  Obviously this doesn't work in all cases, one has to be mature enough to internalize and understand the ramifications when exposed to them.  But they do have to be exposed to what these risks and ramifications are.<p>""Social liberals in the country’s “blue states” tend to support sex education and are not particularly troubled by the idea that many teen-agers have sex before marriage, but would regard a teen-age daughter’s pregnancy as devastating news. And the social conservatives in “red states” generally advocate abstinence-only education and denounce sex before marriage, but are relatively unruffled if a teen-ager becomes pregnant, as long as she doesn’t choose to have an abortion.""<p>There's the answer right there.  If the families and communities treat teenage pregnancy as a (relative) non-event, then there are no ramifications to getting pregnant.  They ""understand the ramifications"" and ""the risk of what they are doing"" to be relatively low.  By encouraging abstinence and not making it hard on those who don't practice abstinence, it's sending a message that sex isn't that big of a deal.",1225339855

348412,comment,348377,348379,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"According to a conversation I had with Paul Buchheit (paul here at HN) in the past, GMail spam filters are heavily reputation based, which leads me to believe that Bayesian filtering is not a first line of defense, and likely would be specific to each mailbox rather than universally applied.  So, if it's happening to everyone, then it's a universal rule at GMail that's doing the filtering, and thus I would guess not heavily based on any Bayesian results.  But I might be wrong, GMail spam filtering may have changed dramatically since paul worked on the project, or I may have simply misunderstood his explanation.<p>But pg did invent the most powerful recent spam fighting technique.  I'm not sure why one would say the description provided in the essay isn't the same as inventing it?  Certainly Bayesian analysis existed long before the essay, but I think it's safe to say that the inventor of the airplane was no less its inventor because the internal combustion engine existed before.",1225339624

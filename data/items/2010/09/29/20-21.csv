In this case banks are controlling the market to hold them up.  By the way, putting them all on the market would not necessarily lead to another wave of foreclosures.<p><i>If it's the government propping up house prices, kidly explain why prices are stable when there are ~300,000 homes in various stages of foreclosure:</i><p>Foreclosures are primarily driven by the owners ability to make their mortgage payment.  Current house prices have little to do with that ability.  A lower price could prevent the owner from being able to sell, but that assumes there would have been buyers at the higher price.<p><i>Seriously, what information are you basing these conclusions on?</i><p>Prices have come down, but the government has done it's best to hold interest rates artificially low so that people could refi and possibly get out of the idiotic loans they took on.  These low rates have also helped those with money buy houses at the still over priced prices thus propping them up.  There are also government sponsored loan modifications that help to keep people in homes that they can't afford.  House prices are 'sticky' on the way down by nature, but the government has helped make them stickier through all the help they have been giving.<p>Historically house prices have been set by the average income of a given area (and in general prices raised along with inflation like salaries)[1].  This is because people buy a house based on the monthly payment that they can afford.  Low interest rates lead to higher priced homes and and vice versa (as an aside the best time to buy a house would be when irates are sky high and likely to fall because the absolute price of the house would have to be lower for anyone to afford it), but what stays roughly the same is the payment.<p>What happened during the bubble is that money was so cheap that house prices ran way out in front of most peoples ability to afford a house without taking on a crazy loan.  Even in areas where prices have fallen, if you compare prices to average income you'll see that many houses are still way beyond the average persons ability to afford them.  In addition to the supply situation you mentioned, if you also add in that many people have been permanently put out of the market with banks now requiring down payments, better credit scores, and conventional loans the demand side of the equation has also fallen (and may never return to those levels).<p>[1] Like most rules there are exceptions, in particular location. An area where many rich people buy second homes for vacation purposes may not reflect house price as a function of average salary for the area.  Common sense will tell you if you're in one of those neighborhoods versus one where the people living there work nearby.",1285793118

The article did not explicitly state the metric used to quantify ""output"", but, given other similar studies I've seen, I must presume that profit/employee across the economy is a likely underlying metric.  Given such a metric, could labor cost differences explain this ""efficiency""?  Let us consider a contrived example where, in Ohio, construction workers earn $20/hour and, in New York, $60.  If we examined the techniques used (by capitalists) to build a structure, we would surely observe more capital-intensive but labor saving techniques in New York when compared to Ohio.  Does this mean that the New York workers get more done?  If you measure output (yards of concrete spread per day or whatever), then yes -- using a really expensive robotic concrete spreader allows the $60/hour employee to produce a lot of output.  However, it might also be rational in Ohio to forgo the machine in favor of more labor-intensive methods.  The profitability of the Ohio construction company might actually be higher, but the laborers in New York are ""more productive.""<p>I know little of Germany's regulations w.r.t. employment.  Are labor costs (due to not only wages but taxes paid by the employer and other non-wage burdens) higher?  Do employers in Germany rationally select higher levels of automation?

That's a huge stretch from CD-quality audio--it used to be presumed the minimum required for voice to be understandable, and besides the u-law encoding, it's uncompressed.  You would get much better audio quality by recording voice at a higher sampling rate and encoding it as a 64kbps MP3, which is the same bitrate as the PSTN and trivial for cellphone hardware to do; however, cellphones have to be able to call landlines and other cellphones, and the common point of connectivity (and so the lowest common denominator) is the PSTN.  VoIP can use even better audio compression algorithms that result in audio quality far superior to anything you'd hear through the PSTN.  For instance, this is why many reviewers of FaceTime report that activating it makes the audio quality of their call noticeably better, on top of all the niceties of the video stream.<p>It's not just humans that have trouble hearing at 8kHz 8-bit u-law--voice transcription software is remarkably more accurate when using a microphone on a computer recording at 44kHz 16-bit compared to over the phone.  This is part of the reason, for instance, Google Voice transcription is nowhere near as effective as Dragon Naturally Speaking on your laptop, and never will be.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_network"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_switched_telephone_netwo...</a>",1285790842

If you have any suggestions on good ways to do that we'd love to hear them!<p>And finally, re: iPads, we're not tied specifically to a device -- we're a web app so we work on anything that is HTML5 capable. We're trying to find the right case for iPads to make them more resilient, but we're also trying to find some cheaper devices such that it's not such a big deal if they get dirty...<p>Again, thanks for the feedback and hopefully we can talk again sometime.

It seems like its success is because of this, not despite it. Rather than be a formulaic FPS, RTS, RPG, etc, it's something (fairly) new that leaves it up to the player to have fun with. I've heard the comparison to Lego frequently, and I think it's an apt one. Most videogames today play more like movies, but sometimes it's nice to have a game that you can play with how you like.<p>(This post started out about being about being willing to ignore conventions, but drifted somewhat into the nature of gameplay, sorry.)",1285790658

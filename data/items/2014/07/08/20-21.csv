8006722,comment,8006308,8006308,5,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;ve been reading through the &quot;A History of Korea&quot; by Michael Seth, hoping to get some insight into how Korea went from a colonized underdog into a global economic power in such a short time. The modern history of both Koreas is truly fascinating as are their early parallels.<p>One thing I&#x27;ve been surprised to learn is how much of a role various Christian groups in Korea played in anti-governmnet activities going all the way back to the Japanese Colonial period. There&#x27;s some interesting and unique history there with respect to Korea&#x27;s history with Christianity -- including being one of the only countries with a history of self-conversion, before missionaries ever showed up there.<p>More recently, the parallels between the economic development of the North and the South are quite striking. While the North made some very big economic development strides early on, the long term focus on almost pure heavy industry and military development caused the country to stagnate and economically regress -- despite an almost constant stream of aid and support from first the Soviet Bloc and then China. The infrastructure has begun to crumble because the state never bothered developing the entire economic ecosystem needed to keep it running.<p>The South on the other hand, under the military dictator, Park Chung-hee, took a more step-wise foundation building approach that&#x27;s yielded tremendous long-term success for the country. Seizing power from an incompetently run, but democratic, government. Park put in place a complex series of programs designed to build up an export-oriented economy through gradual development of industry from light-industry to heavy.<p>It was tremendously corrupt, and built on lots of favor trading. But he used the power of the military and the government to keep the economy focused on pure growth, and pragmatically eliminated &quot;non-essential&quot; economic activities. Starting with things like sugar refineries and textile manufacturing, the country started working up to construction (a significant number of U.S. projects during the Vietnam war were built by Korean companies), then shipbuilding, cars, petrochemicals, etc. Each designed to both provide economic opportunities for export, as well as provide domestic capabilities for the next steps.<p>No political activity was allowed and the country was basically run like a giant, efficient, no-nonsense, military apparatus for decades. It took until the 80s before it was really time to switch off from this into the more liberal and democratic country we see today.<p>He financed all this with a very pragmatic finance scheme, hitting up Japans booming economy during the 60s and 70s, despite a great deal of animosity between the two countries. And then more importantly sold back the finished goods to Japan and the U.S. markets.<p>It was under Park that South Korea started doing major construction projects in the middle-East. The technical ability of South Korean construction companies can&#x27;t be underestimated -- the Burj Khalifa was built by Samsung.<p>Despite significant student demonstrations and unrest during the Park administration (and the similar Chun Doo-hwan one that closely followed), most people were simply too busy working and scratching out a living to take to the streets, or form anti-government organizations.<p>There&#x27;s other parallels as well, extremely low participation in the work force by women, a history of foreign meddling, etc.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that idle hands may just be the source of a lot of this misery. In richer Arab countries, most of the work is done by foreigners on the cheap and locals live off of the proceeds, they&#x27;re bored and have nothing else to do. In poorer ones, people need jobs, are desperate and again, have nothing else to do.<p>There&#x27;s been some half-hearted attempts to provide other activities. KAUST, for example, is a Science and Tech graduate-level university that&#x27;s had billions invested into it. But one of the interesting points my book brings up is that setting up advanced schooling, or advanced industry, doesn&#x27;t make sense unless a Park style staged economic program is put in place first to build all of the necessary social, educational and economic foundations to support these advanced industries. You can&#x27;t really leapfrog these things, but you can make progress unbelievably fast.<p>The real problem is that, at least for the oil rich parts of the Arab world, there isn&#x27;t much incentive to really do these things. If any place might have a go, someplace oil-poor, like Egypt, might be a logical place to kick off something like a &quot;Tiger of the Nile&quot; program. I know I&#x27;m not the first person to think of this either.<p><a href=""http://www.academia.edu/5319334/A_Comparison_of_the_Political_Economy_of_Egypt_and_South_Korea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.academia.edu/5319334/A_Comparison_of_the_Politica...</a><p><a href=""http://www.e-ir.info/2013/12/23/south-korea-egypt-and-wallersteins-world-system-analysis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.e-ir.info/2013/12/23/south-korea-egypt-and-waller...</a><p><a href=""http://www.imd.org/research/challenges/TC057-13-two-dictatorships-lehmann.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.imd.org/research/challenges/TC057-13-two-dictator...</a>",1404853155

With sites like c9.io, he can have a coding environment in the cloud and access it from any web browser, including a random library computer.<p>What needs to happen is inspiration. If you can inspire someone to believe in himself and show how comparatively easy current technologies are, you should be able to ignite the self-sustaining desire to get better.<p>My approach would be to pick a funded company that resonates with him and clone it. There are plenty of them that can be cloned in a day. This will demonstrate that building software capable of attracting funding is not difficult and that becoming an engineer on such a team is easier than pursuing professional sports.<p>Once you decide on the target, systematically disassemble the site and discuss what makes it work.<p>Install git, setup a local repo and a repo on bitbucket, and instruct the student to &#x27;git commit&#x27; after substantial changes and &#x27;git push&#x27; every so often. It&#x27;s never too soon to introduce version control.<p>Starting with HTML, talk about DIVs and nothing else. There is no need to talk about other tags. Explain that DIVs are the building blocks and demonstrate a page built of just DIVs and no other tags. Fill it with Lorem and style with Bootstrap. Ignore AJAX until much later.<p>This will lead into CSS. Explain how CSS is used to style DIVs so each element looks different.<p>Now I would talk about Bootstrap and how it changed the way we build web apps.<p>Once CSS is a relatively clear concept, lead into jQuery but don&#x27;t talk about JavaScript in general. jQuery would be introduced as a way to interact with DOM.<p>JavaScript is a confusing language to learn as a first language. It may make sense to shift gears and talk about Ruby and Python, whichever one is more familiar.<p>By now, this person should be ready to learn about control structures, loops, and other basics of programming. It is difficult to get motivation to learn that without a reason to learn it.<p>I would introduce real programming by following the BDD methodology. Teach the student to write tests before talking about how to make them pass. It is so unusual that it should be intriguing. I am not familiar enough, as of this writing, whether Ruby or Python have a better integrated testing frameworks, but I will explore that in detail later.<p>Once the student has a solid understanding of Ruby or Python, I would only then introduce JavaScript and map the concepts from Ruby or Python to JavaScript. By now prototypal inheritance will not seem as alien and brackets and semicolons will be just extra things to type.<p>AJAX and oAuth as well as the concept of REST APIs would be next.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s go to the cutting edge and tie it all up with Meteor and Velocity testing. This will introduce nodejs, MongoDB and mobile app syncing.<p>Just say no to PHP. We thankfully have alternatives to it now.<p>As for books, I would advise the student to get a library card at a library that has access to either Safari Books Online or Books 24x7. He will then have access to the bulk of O&#x27;Reilly titles. I prefer the Headfirst series when getting started with a new language.<p>Little known fact: as a resident of the state you can get a library card from any library within that state and different libraries have different resources. This means he doesn&#x27;t have to be limited to whatever library is local to his community. I have 7 library cards.<p>Hmm... this might inspire me to produce a video course based on this outline and test how well this theory might work.

Nor should anyone need a PhD in mathematics to understand the strange notations in your examples/proofs.<p>Operators cannot be searched for in the same way ASCII text can - we need specialized search engines which don&#x27;t ignore characters - and they generally need to be written on a per-language basis to be useful. I think the time wasted doing this far exceeds the benefits user-defined operators provide.<p>Also, many unicode characters look alike, and it may be possible to utilize this in malicious ways where arbitrary characters may be used - by assuming someone reading/reviewing code will not look up the code points of every character. Having a limited set of characters makes it pretty simple to distinguish each one, unless you have poor fonts and can&#x27;t make out differences between 1,I,l etc.<p>Operators are useful for sure, but they&#x27;re never <i>necessary</i>. More to the point, they are <i>just</i> functions - treating them specially is silly, because it&#x27;s much more useful to abstract over functions of any arity than to abstract over only binary functions.",1404852766

For a student that&#x27;s struggling to understand what&#x27;s happening (not just type and have faith), blocks turn into one of those &#x27;down the rabbit hole&#x27; pieces of syntax that requires a bunch of hand waving and earnest assertions of eventual understanding.<p>If you&#x27;ve got an explanation that would work in week 2 or 3 of a CS1 course, I&#x27;d love to hear it.

While Islamic democracies elsewhere (such as Indonesia—see article) are doing fine, in the Arab world the very fabric of the state is weak.<p>First, &quot;fine&quot; is relative. Religious conservatives have been a major force in turning back progress in countries like Bangladesh. The 1972 constitution envisioned a secular republic, and the end result was . . . something less than that. In particular, a series of constitutional amendments eliminated the commitment to secularism and made Islam the state religion. Over the past few decades, there was been a substantial regression in areas like womens&#x27; rights, coupled with an increase in public religiousity.<p>Second, comparing the Arab states to south Asian muslim states is comparing apples and oranges. To use Bangladesh as an example again, that country has had organized government for almost all the past 500 years, between the Mughals, the British Empire, India, Pakistan, and independence. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, while nominally part of several different empires prior to the 20th century, was always on the outskirts of those empires, and was never really an orderly, centrally-administered place. In Saudi Arabia, central government has taken a back seat to tribal power for almost that whole history.<p>There&#x27;s lot&#x27;s of other reasons, obviously. I think a big one is this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse</a>.

You get to a point where you&#x27;ve read enough PR department press releases that you can write the entire summary (at least to the required standards, which in my experience, is &quot;barely comprehensible English&quot;) by looking at the headline. I was able to finish 50 word summaries in under 30 seconds. They values range from .25-.50 and they seem to come from a lot of submitters.<p>I&#x27;ve had a theory that out in the world somewhere is someone selling a guide to using MTurk to create article summaries and the guide suggests the price range of $.25-.50 because for the entire time that I&#x27;ve been on MTurk (many years now), every time I come back the price range is the same with small fluctuation.<p>Past the relatively low amount of summaries that are posted daily, money can be made by watching the right forums where people post high paying HITs (the name of the most popular forum eludes me at the moment) that are typically 5-15 minute surveys that pay .5-3.00 each.<p>By far, the biggest barrier to making a decent wage for me was the number of available HITs. The ones that pay over pennies each are few while the ones that are horrible time invests are everywhere. If I had an unlimited number of summary HITs, I could have made well over minimum wage.<p>[0] Made about $450 over the time, but this was sporadic, random working periods.",1404850654

FOIA requests, meetings, hearings, transcripts, budgets, expenditures, rosters, etc.<p>What might make governments even more accountable are the threats of loss of tax revenue (people and companies doing business elsewhere) and loss of campaign contributions. This is similar to how corporations are held accountable by shareholders (CEO compensation), employees (take their talents elsewhere) and customers",1404850029

Israel is no democracy - they claim the West Bank is Israel, in a defacto sense it is, and they do not let Arabs vote.  We see the contemplation of Islam causing problems, why don&#x27;t we look at Judaism in the same manner in how it is against democracy?

127489,comment,127470,127484,0,0,mk,,,"Added. This makes some sense. I often find that on reddit some stories that are actually interesting get downvoted to oblivion for no apparent reason and yet at a later time are up voted to the front page with a similar headline. I'm sure there are other cases where it would bring up other problems.",1204484088
127488,comment,127233,127385,0,0,bobp,,,"I agree. Despite the guidelines, I can see this potentially being used to spread rumors, gossip, lie, or just stuff that's plain unflattering on people. I doubt many people will be actively monitoring their Biographicon profile and this content could go undetected for a while, causing the subjects real harm.",1204484087

I can't think of an English equivalent now, but both people are said to ""follow the book strictly.""<p>There are many things to ask; I just wondered if you had a general impression about the comparison. You said they share quite a few traits -- for example?",1204484058

It's fair to say it is extremely unevenly distributed. It's also fair to say the US has the best university system in the world. Just look at where people try to go to study.",1204483673

It's also difficult to measure wealth.

8419032,comment,8418836,8418928,1,0,chrisdone,,,"Ollie is the hardest thing to learn in skateboarding. It took me and my friends a long time. I think it&#x27;s hard to explain it, so it&#x27;s hard to teach.<p>It&#x27;s rather that the initial smack or pop of the tail against the floor makes the board fly upward, which you can reproduce by just by stamping on the tail of your board. That was my first insight.<p>You can do a standing Ollie with one foot: stamp it and as the board starts going up you shove your same foot to the right to stabilize it. After mastering that, a two-foot Ollie was just a matter of practice. Also, the longer you delay putting any downward force in the nose, the more air you get. I feel like I should make a video of a standing single foot Ollie, as two feet complicate demonstration, I think.<p>The moving forward of the foot isn&#x27;t for adding more forward velocity, a standing Ollie can get really high and land in the same place. A moving Ollie relies on your existing velocity, which should be pretty high.<p>I&#x27;ve not skated for about 10 years, but I got a board recently to see if I still had it. Ollie&#x27;ing is like riding a bike, never forget how to do it. :)",1412639574

Tesla/Elon has shown that they&#x27;ll make good on vehicle upgrades/substandard parts if needed (battery shield and debris bar upgrades at no charge).<p>Generally speaking, how much a car costs to fix correlates with what the car costs new.   Part of this is parts cost;  I mean, if you compare a 3-5 year old bmw 3 series to a new honda civic, you are getting a car of about the same size for about the same price... but the BMW rotors, for instance, are beefier to begin with, and they wear faster -  even if you are just paying for the metal, you are paying more for bmw rotors.  (with brakes and tires, there is usually a trade-off between performance and longevity, to some extent.  Softer tires/softer rotors do the job better, but don&#x27;t last as long.)<p>On an electric car, I would expect this to be dominated by the cost of battery replacement, which I would assume would dominate the cost of electric car maintenance. A smaller electric car is going to have a smaller (in both size and power) battery pack, and a smaller battery pack is going to cost you less to replace when it wears out.<p>The other part of it is price discrimination.  Service and parts for the bmw are priced, you know, for people that can afford a bmw.  If you have a bmw, the mechanic is going to charge you the &quot;premium service&quot; because it&#x27;s a good indicator that you are willing to spend more on a car than the person that drives a civic.",1412638127

The CEO originally wrote:<p>> When an employee is dismissed from employment at a company, the policy of almost every company (including reddit) is not to comment, either publicly or internally. This is because companies have no desire to ruin someone&#x27;s future employment prospects by broadcasting to the world that they were fired. In return, the polite expectation is that the employee will not go shooting their mouth off about the company especially (as in your case) through irresponsibly unfounded speculation. Signing a non-disparagement indicates that you have no intention to do this, so the company can then say &quot;Ok, if anyone comes asking for a reference on this guy, we needn&#x27;t say he was fired, just give a mildly positive reference.&quot;<p>The CEO is effectively stating that Reddit was willing to provide a &quot;mildly positive reference&quot; for an ex-employee the CEO now claims was totally incompetent and &quot;did not even come close&quot; to getting his work done. Further, he states that Reddit was willing to omit the fact that the ex-employee was terminated for cause (fired). This is horribly unprofessional and, in my opinion, completely dishonest. Based on the CEO&#x27;s incredulous statement, I don&#x27;t see how anybody can trust a reference from Reddit.<p>Note that this is not common policy as the CEO implies. Non-disparagement clauses are typically negotiated for monetary compensation (severance pay), not for the promise of a dishonest reference.<p>Companies don&#x27;t comment on employee terminations because of the legal risks associated with doing so. In fact, one of the ways some companies address these risks is by adopting a no reference policy. They will simply verify employment and dates of employment when asked, and offer nothing more.",1412638064

We, the large company, had a rather large budget to buy them, like 7 figures, not bad for a company without a published v1 and with no revenue. We did not specifically say how much we were willing to give or what we were willing to do for them, because that is negotiation. On the other hand, they hide behind lawyers, talked to us only generally, and left us in the dark. In the end we decided the time wasn&#x27;t worth it (their technical skills and product offering sure were, but that&#x27;s another story), so we ended the discussions. Ultimately they ran out of funding and said it was our &quot;large companies distractions&quot; that kept them from &quot;making it big&quot;. Maybe that is true, I can&#x27;t rewrite history to know for sure whether it is or not. However, what I can say is if they had said &quot;Sure we&#x27;re willing to show what we can do, we want $x,000,000 if we can show we are capable&quot;, we would have given it to them. Hell we would have paid for the due diligence (&quot;We want $200,000 to go through your due diligence whether we make a deal or not&quot; would have been a very acceptable request).

Elsewhere, they cite how a study showing the ills of stress was misused. Nothing here seems to back the conclusion that stress is beneficial.<p>Work, of course, is not war, but this Paul Fussell[1] quote comes to mind as a demonstration that everyone has a finite tolerance for stress: <i>&quot;In war it is not just the weak soldiers, or the sensitive ones, or the highly imaginative or cowardly ones, who will break down. All will break down if in combat long enough. &quot;Long enough&quot; is now defined by physicians and psychiatrists as between 200 and 240 days.&quot;</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/bookauth/battle/fussell.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/bookauth/battle...</a>",1412636867

How can the mailing list software know that the direct reply actually got through to the people in the To: and CC: list?<p>Didn&#x27;t the intended recipients occasionally miss replies to their messages, and wasn&#x27;t it a bad idea to put the responsibility of re-sending bounced (or un-routable) email to the person you&#x27;re replying to in the hands of the person writing the reply, not the mailing list itself?

That&#x27;s kind of inefficient, in my view.  But as sp332 pointed out, the kids should already know how to subtract numbers by this point.  If a kid didn&#x27;t get it before, this curriculum throws a new method at them, hoping that this one will make sense to them.

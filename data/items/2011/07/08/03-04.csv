I know that and use screen, and the post we are discussing mentions tmux, so he knows it as well.<p>>  whereas an emulator with some mux features can provide benefits not easily achievable with a standalone multiplexer.<p>The op was being snarky but that was the whole point. iterm2 doesn't seem to be giving something which we(in a generic sense; I use linux and have nothing to do with iterm) want and aren't already doing in the current emulator/multiplexer setup.<p>> One example would be mouse-based text selection. Using vertical splits in tmux, and triple-clicking to select a full line will select the contents of both split regions, whereas a GUI app can limit it to one region. I'm sure there are plenty of other features.<p>I don't use tmux but that's the behavior in gnu screen vertical split as well.",1310097274

Build the app (or other type of project) you've always wanted to, and complete every part of it. You'll need to hire a designer if you want people to use it, but many professional designers are willing to trade services, so you don't need to spend anything there. What you do after you release your product depends on what it is. If it's a web app, then launch it on a good server, but something that doesn't cost too much. I'd recommend an EC2 server which is relatively low cost and gives you a free trial long enough to see what users will think of it before you make too big of an investment. If it looks like it's going to be successful, then you just succeeded in your goal. If not, you only made a small investment and try not to get discouraged; build something else.<p>Apart from that, I would recommend you join forrst if you haven't already. If you haven't and need an invite, I can giv you one. Forrst really helped my programming skills go from just a hobby to something that people ask to hire me for without me ever having to search for clients.<p>Forrst also helped me get my name out there. It's made my posts visible to enough developers that I've had my stuff tweeted about by people with over 20,000 followers.<p>But above all I'd recommend to just learn as much as you can and get as much experience as possible. If you want to make a career out of it (which seems like a good fit for you), there's no such thing as too much knowledge or experience, it's what can separate you from the crowd. If you can finish college with a degree in another science field _and_ 6 or so years of real life programming experience, you'll be leagues ahead of the competition.<p>Best of luck!",1310096381

The problem was that the conduit feeding the Sphinx indexer was handling Unicode incorrectly (to be specific, it was deleting certain bytes wholesale because this guy believed them never to be valid, and this broke multi-byte sequences horribly). Those two days would have been much better spent working on his current project.<p>Additionally, not handling Unicode correctly can leave you open to certain types of security holes!<p>The biggest of these is probably that Unicode means _a string is not an array of bytes_, so nave allocators for languages with byte-array strings (read: C and its brethren) are susceptible to buffer overruns when handed multi-byte Unicode sequences when they're expecting ASCII.<p>Here's another one: the Unicode character space contains many, many glyphs that look almost (or in some cases exactly) like ASCII characters. RFC 3492 defines a framework for internationalized domain names (IDN) that encodes non-ASCII code points using ASCII characters, and the most common implementations of this <i>transparently</i> go between the two. This means that you could register ""bnkofamerica.com"" (actually xn--bnkofamerica-x9j.com) and put a phishing site there, and people would happily click on the identical-looking URL and give you their bank account. This was pointed out several years ago and most modern browsers have mechanisms in place to defend against it, but your custom application might not unless you're careful to check what you're doing.<p>There are plenty of blog posts and articles out there designed to tell you how to be safe when dealing with Unicode (and you should assume that you will be).

2741158,comment,2726673,2729106,1,0,rluhar,,,"Indeed. But sometimes you need ""magic"".  If you have a developer that is working on a specific part of an application, building business logic that does not require her to know how MQ transactions are handled, or which database drivers are used, using a DI framework like Spring or Guice may help. These frameworks may add some overhead, but they also make unit testing, documentation and reduce code complexity of business logic.<p>I guess it depends on the team you are working with. If you have solid, experienced engineers who understand the business domain, using Spring may not be relevant.  But if you have a team that have different levels of skills and experience, a framework that abstracts away some of the underlying complexity is useful.<p>If you are building a real time trading system, you probably don't want to use Spring because you want to control each and every component. But for most other projects it can be useful.<p>Btw - your link mentions TDD.  What tools did you use? (just out of curiousity..)",1310094028

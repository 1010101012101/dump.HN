The fact that multiple accounts were compromised through this attack (despite their rate limiting) and that it would be literally impossible to guess my password sans quantum computing indicates _their_ password was compromised, not the password of any affected account.  The solution is for them to use proper password security.",1384909161

In no way did I mean to suggest that Google was going to take the role of a UN with teeth, to mediate between different countries.<p>It would be more accurate for me to say that Google has a demonstrated willingness to allow their employees to contribute to political activism using company resources. Absolutely, it has a selfish motive, but it&#x27;s a central principle of capitalism to leverage selfish motives into public goods. (No comment on the principle itself.)",1384909131

Give them a chance to explain. If the company is 30 people you should be able to drop by the CEOs office and ask. Like I said they may not be saying anything because the financing is not final.<p>Alternatively if they are not cooperative.<p>Go in tomorrow and ask to exercise your vested options. At this point they have no choice but to tell you the FMV of those options. Don&#x27;t exercise them, or do that is a separate topic and you have to watch out for tax liability.<p>Do it again after the financing finishes. The FMV of your shares will change. If it is significantly lower the options may not be worth your time.<p>They can&#x27;t avoid telling you the FMV of the shares you have because you need to know to calculate your tax liability for the spread between the strike price and the current FMV.<p>Think of it like any other investment. If it isn&#x27;t gaining in value it&#x27;s not worth your time. If the FMV of your shares   is say 4/5s of what you had before financing you did well. If it is 1/9 you got screwed or your company is doing very poorly (although why would anyone invest in it then...) In the middle it is more complicated.<p>If your company is healthy and not taking on a large amount of money for growth the FMV of your shares might actually increase despite the dilution.",1384908565

6765668,comment,6762389,6763614,2,0,ScottBurson,,,"The biggest problem with stack ranking, as I have read about it being practiced, is that it is implemented on a team-by-team basis rather than across an entire engineering department.  The consequence is that differences in strength <i>between</i> teams are not taken into account -- the members of each team are ranked only relative to the other members of that team.  This leads to people trying to game the system in various ways to make sure they&#x27;re not seen as the weakest on their team.<p>Ranking all engineers in the department together would be more difficult.  Managers have a hard enough time getting a read on the strength of their own people; getting them to agree on how their people rank against the other managers&#x27; people would take quite a bit of work, I imagine.  But it would give a much better answer to the question of whom to let go first, and it wouldn&#x27;t provide as much incentive to game the system.<p>And I agree with you that the ranking should explicitly emphasize how well each employee works with their teammates.",1384908540

6765663,comment,6764804,6765461,4,0,lambda,,,"Yeah, SO is explicitly designed not to be appropriate for qualitative questions with nuance. The problem is that those kinds of questions can frequently lead to endless debate, there&#x27;s no clear &quot;right&quot; answer, and so on, and anything where there&#x27;s voting and marking &quot;accepted&quot; answers and which is designed to be a good resource for someone Googling something to be able to find an answer isn&#x27;t going to be a good fit for qualitative, subjective, nuanced questions.<p>I am a professional software developer in real life, and I use SO to ask questions occasionally, and answer questions often. There are definitely plenty of cases where it is much more useful than just elementary &quot;how do I X&quot;; there are lots of cases of real, difficult questions being asked and answered, or lots more of people who are experienced developers but new on a particular language or framework or library asking questions about that. It&#x27;s also quite good at it&#x27;s mission, of providing fairly good answers for when you Google a question, rather than a forum post where you have to go to the third page to find a comment that almost, but not quite, actually answers the question, and then two pages further to find the clarification that makes it all actually work.<p>So, you have to use it for the right kinds of questions, but I find that it really does work fairly well for those. The two main problems are that there is a somewhat low signal to noise ratio, as on any popular forum (lots of beginners asking those basic questions that you mention, lots of people asking questions poorly or unclearly, lots of people jumping on people for not quite asking their question perfectly at first), and that people are a little hasty to close imperfect questions without giving them time to be fleshed out into good questions.<p>The moderation, voting, and closing of questions is supposed to help with that signal to noise ratio, but I&#x27;m a bit skeptical, as it seems to be suppressing a little too much signal, and letting through a little too much noise.<p>Here&#x27;s an example of StackOverflow working for a fairly deep question, about the maximal possible asymptotic slowdown due to purely functional programming: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990464/efficiency-of-purely-functional-programming"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1990464/efficiency-of-pur...</a><p>Now, we saw the problems that I described at first (the question was a little bit vague, a lot of people jumped in with hasty and incorrect answers, and it was closed for being too vague), but since the system allows editing, voting, and re-opening of questions, those problems were fixed.<p>For a lot of questions, if you Google for a question and find it on StackOverflow, there&#x27;s a very good chance it will be answered correctly. If you find a question that has no answer or was answered incorrectly, you are able to correct it or answer it yourself.<p>I guess what I&#x27;m saying is that StackOverflow isn&#x27;t perfect, but you really shouldn&#x27;t write it off based on a single bad experience. Just keep in mind what it is for; questions that are answerable, not just subjective or bikeshed questions, and you need to do at least some effort to ask a good question that has enough detail to be possible to answer.",1384908436

6765500,comment,6763520,6764178,1,0,gizmo686,,,"In practice, I suspect that we have numerous ways of dealing with mutations. However, if I recall my high-school biology correctly, during DNA replication there is error correction. My guess would be that evolution would tend to regulate mutations rates through the efficiency of error correction mechanisms (and the accuracy of the primary duplication mechanism) more so than a meta-evolution in the structure of DNA. Having said that, it is reasonable that there would be evolutionary pressure to have DNA that requires more mutations before becoming dangerous.<p>Responding to the content of your post. DNA is not executable code as much as data. The &#x27;primary&#x27; purpose of DNA is to provide the blueprints for proteins. DNA sequences can be thought of in by grouping the base pairs in 3 called codons (this grouping is not reflected in the molecular structure). The beginning and end of a gene are marked by &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; codons, which are just a specific DNA subsequence. Conceptually, a gene is converted into a protein by replacing each codon with its corresponding ammino acid (based on a lookup table) [1]. The function of a gene is determined by the chemical properties of the resulting protein.<p>As it turns out, there are parts of DNA that do not code for proteins, yet still have significant effect. However, I am not aware of any evidence of a naturally occurring use of DNA that resembles executable code.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.biogem.org/codon.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biogem.org/codon.jpg</a>",1384906049

To me, this kind of thing would be much more readable using promises to wrap the asynchronous nature of the code. Assuming you used when.js, you could do something like:<p><pre><code>  function delay(fn, ms) {
    return when(function (resolve) {
      setTimeout(function () {
        fn();
        resolve();
      }, ms || 0);
    });
  }

  function eachDelay(arr, fn, ms) {
    arr.reduce(function (prev, curr) {
      prev.then(function () {
        return fn(curr);
      });
    }, when(null));
  }
</code></pre>
That looks more complicated on the surface, but in reality, libraries like when.js and underscore give you convenience functions that abstract away much of this boilerplate. I didn&#x27;t want to presume anything but the bare `when`. If you really get used to programming &quot;the combinator way&quot;, you get to the point where you write these cute little primative combinators that can be combined in very readable ways. If you like coding in this style, definitely check out Javascript Allong (<a href=""https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read"" rel=""nofollow"">https://leanpub.com/javascript-allonge/read</a>), which makes this all look far more appealing than I&#x27;ve done here.",1384905883

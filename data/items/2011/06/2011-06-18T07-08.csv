A few things to be aware of:<p>1. Security. I can't stress this enough, as people new to managing their own VPS can end up doing some bad mistakes with respect to security, e.g. leaving root account login enabled, weak firewall etc. Make sure you do a bit of googling to make sure you get a good hang of the security aspects of hosting your sites on your own VPS.<p>2. Although you mentioned that your sites are low traffic ones, you might still want to choose a light weight webserver like nginx/lighthttpd over Apache, which can be quite heavy weight and need a larger slice.<p>3. You won't have any mail server by default, which is a free benefit in a shared hosting environment. Setting up and managing your own mail server can be nightmarish.. Look into something like Amazon Simple Email service for that.",1308383741
2668197,comment,2668119,2668119,1,0,blackRust,,,"""1. A/B testing requires sacrificing some conversions as part of the experiment.""
Yes, because it is a net gain if you do it right. If you want 5 signups today instead of 50 in two weeks you're doing it wrong.<p>""2. A/B testing measures only quantity, not quality.""
If you have anything that can quantify your 'quality' of customers then include it in your metrics (I understand this can be hard). If you don't then it is not quantifiable and any analysis of 'quality' won't be based on statistics.<p>I agree on the other points. Overall I think A/B & multivariate testing is a good approach but can significantly be improved.<p>It seems like we use it in 'one size chunks' rather than as continuous improvement. Yes we do it ever 'x' days/weeks.
What would be interesting is some kind of machine learning algorithm applied to A/B testing. It has the success metrics, you set a rotation period and it focuses in on the part that works.<p>You would have to integrate a factor for #5 ""Things change"" so that the algorithm has the flexibility to adjust to those changes.",1308383697

There is very little excuse that Netflix has for not having this content available. While ""the best"" solution from a technical perspective is to figure out a way to add captions to content, the alternative, serving up a ""burned in"" caption feed for those who need it, is technically possible and easily done.<p>Of course that costs Netflix money, they have to maintain two copies of each movie. But the law says you have to make the same accommodations available to disabled individuals as others have. Disabled persons shouldn't have to wait until Netflix can find ""the efficient"" answer, or the best technological solution. It is Netflix's responsibility to make this content accessible, and if today that means two copies of the content, so be it. Such laws are there to protect disabled individuals when it's not the best answer for a company's ""bottom line"" to accommodate them.<p>Netflix has been dragging their feet on this, and this is why they will likely lose this case.",1308383257

I may be a little band with only a $20 to spend a month on promoting myself, but I can still reach an engaged audience to come to shows.<p>And like ad-words there's an inherent feedback loop which keeps all parties in check. Fans will only listen if they hear music they like and band will only pay if they have listeners to promote to. The dynamics work out that its in the company's incentive to do the best job they can matching bands with fans.<p>Bands are like any business, the band is the brand, the song is the advertisement. I've got countless friends who spend all day outside of clubs handing out 10 cent fliers that just end up in the trash.

I think the guy working on Phantom protocol (code.google.com/p/phantom) was planning on using something like DHT for a decentralized DNS.<p>Right now there are only 2 choices if you want to keep a free Internet:<p>1) Try to stop them from passing bills like Protect IP, by making a lot of noise online and offline, and trying to gather as much support for this.<p>2) Let them do what they want, and eventually we all move to something like Phantom.<p>Obviously this 2nd solution doesn't seem ideal, at least in the short term. Long term, it might be better to have a completely anonymized and decentralized Internet. But it seems like such a hard task to get to the point where many people would use it. It took a decade for Bittorrent to be used by many people, even though I wouldn't say it's exactly mainstream right now.<p>So the <i>easier</i> way to keep our Internet freedoms would be to speak out against such measures and do whatever it takes to stop them (even revolutions). And it seems that Anonymous is already moving to do just that:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_9T1SPJXRI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_9T1SPJXRI</a>",1308380938

The content he was writing was ephemeral fluff, designed to fill the daily news hole. It's not like Wikipedia. They could lose everything that all these writers wrote up to 6 months ago and chances are that nobody would notice.

If you pay attention to the way LulzSec writes and words things, they aren't at all immature in their thinking or worldview.  Ceasing to give a fuck about perceived trivialities is something that comes with age and seeing how the world really works.  The confidence they have came with age as well. Neither is not a sign of youth whatsoever.<p>I'd guess mid-thirties for these guys, at least for whomever is putting out their twitter updates.  This is someone who is basically immune to white-knighting and is a truly hard-core realist.  It takes quite a while for someone reasonably intelligent to become that cynical, and then a while longer for them to act on it.<p>Anyway, I'm a fan of these guys.  While I wouldn't do what they are doing myself, I certainly understand the mindset.  I'm not quite sure I understand the arguments against what they're doing.  The knee-jerk reactions of wanting to call them wrong frequently seem more immature to me than their recent campaigns.  The real world is messy, and LulzSec's work is a valid reflection of that.<p>As far as the comparisons to sociopathic thinking, that's just ignorant.  Sociopaths generally don't care about anyone but themselves and that's obviously not the case here.  A sociopath would never release any of this data, and would simply use it for their own advantage, regardless of who was harmed.<p>LulzSec is gleaning entertainment here from the unwashed masses to be sure, but they aren't out there enslaving people with debt, indoctrinating them with religion, shooting them for protesting, putting them in cages for drug offenses, etc.  All of which is completely legal, and in my opinion, far more sociopathic than releasing some bit personal data or playing a few practical jokes on people.",1308380736

Boutique hotels are the ones that provide guests with a greater experience on all fronts. Say you wanted to go on vacation to NYC for your anniversary with your wife and you want to let the hotel know what you are coming for. Using a regular online booking service there is no way of doing that, however, with this service, you can let them know it is your anniversary and they can offer you a personalized deal based on the information you provide (free room upgrade, discounted room, gift card to the hotel spa, etc).<p>Hope that clears it up.",1308380701

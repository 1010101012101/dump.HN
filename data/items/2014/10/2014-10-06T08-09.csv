8414866,comment,8414389,8414483,1,0,taway0192837465,,,"huh, there are some terms and notions been thrown around in this discussion that may lead to a very skewed world-view but let me first respond to &quot;With computer driven cars nearly here&quot;(as in &quot;Shut up and work till it last since you are going to be replaced sooner than later&quot;).<p>There is an upcoming revolution (not only) in the IT sector knocking on the door, comparable(in principle, not in scale) to the aftermath of the big industrial revolution in the late 19/early 20th century. Not only are most of the it-services jobs going to be obsolete(I&#x27;m not talking about people facing the customer, although this segment will be affected as well), even many of the &quot;high-level&quot; engineering jobs have an expiration date. Just look at your team, how many &quot;code-pushers&quot; do you have within that team compared to creative folks coming up with new radical(emphasis) ideas. There are &quot;thinkers&quot; and &quot;hands&quot;(and - since the world is never this polarized / clear-cut, some overlap in between - mentioning only so nobody would nit-pick an argument over this). The ratio may vary based on the team/project but &quot;hands&quot; are usually the most in numbers(and this is OK, we do need people that can actually finish a project, can get the work done; this was argued a 1000times here and I agree with most of the conclusions). If you see yourself in the first category(please keep in mind that the term is not a very lucky-chosen one) - there is no reason to be anxious .. well with trade agreements plowing the global economic field 24/7 I&#x27;m sure there is no-one on the planet that could do the same job as good as you for far less(well, to be honest, there indeed are people with a combination of skills that you probably would not find anywhere else - hence the &quot;evil-genius&quot; acquisition by google - and you may be in that category).. for everyone else, something to think about.<p>This process is already gaining momentum in &quot;ES-like&quot; environments - the IT job market is going to change once again and this time it won&#x27;t be a zero-sum game(even when we widen the scope to the whole economy - we have already passed the point where new emerging industries could compensate the rising efficiency of the old ones).<p>Now to the notion of class. To have money is <i>not</i> the same as being wealthy. Having a 6fig salary doesn&#x27;t push you “one class&quot; higher - just imagine what would happen if your skill-set would become obsolete tomorrow. You&#x27;d have to start over in a new industry(I will assume that median of the IT crowd is above average on the IQ scala and therefore would not have a problem finding another job*), the house/apartment you could barely afford is now over your budget and since most of your peers have the same problem, the housing market normalizes; you&#x27;d loose even more money if you&#x27;d want to sell it and move to a cheaper area(now throw-in a mortgage and you are set for years). Being upper-class meant that you had enough diversified &quot;income-producing&quot; assets to overcome such changes without loosing your living standard(I&#x27;d say even more important was/is the &quot;upper-class&quot; social network you were/are a part of, which handles the diversification even better and represents a valuable safety net on its own). How many peers owning stocks from companies across the industry, real-estate(fe an office building on the main street in some &quot;emerging&quot; town), with at least some connections to leaders of other industries / politics etc do you know?<p>So, TL;DR \nA 6figure salary doesn&#x27;t make you jump to a higher &quot;class&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t even make you &quot;wealthy&quot;, it just widens your economical horizon / makes you a little more free(the money-to-freedom function is not linear, nor is the money-to-wealth func)<p>We all are facing the same, unavoidable employment crisis as those bus drivers mentioned above.<p>+ I fully agree with sschueller&#x27;s comment - why not invest in public transport and give something back to the community German Mittelstand-like instead?",1412585194

There are many factors that will attribute to an employees stock in the company, and I&#x27;m not just referring to &#x27;company stock&#x27;. Equity is an entrepreneurs best friend, and as such should be treated little different than a savings account (Rarely touched: with exceptions of a rainy day, or if something exists that you REALLY REALLY want/need e.g. a specific Employee) as opposed to monopoly money, where it is spent till the original owner has none of it left. If the company starts to award every employee high yields of equity, it hinders an entrepreneurs ability to leverage the companies assets to possibly position it&#x27;s longterm stability. This is why there exist so many &#x27;perks and high salaries&#x27;, and they  work... for the most part. However, to imply that these perks and high salaries are falsely impacting an employees investment at a company for long term duration&#x27;s seems a bit of a stretch without data points, perhaps Hacker News should strike up an Anonymous Poll to find out if such claims are true? I will speculate that for some it is nothing more than &#x27;just another job&#x27;, but for the right person, it can be the right job. Thus, perhaps the solution isn&#x27;t necessarily in an excessive amount of equity, or bloated perks, or high salaries; perhaps the true solution is taking the time to find a candidate that isn&#x27;t necessarily as skilled as they could be, but over compensates by possessing a fervor of desire? If that is indeed the appropriate conclusion; isn&#x27;t that in other words what Y.Combinator is all about? The ability to find individuals in the most unliklyist of places with a will and a heart to attempt what may just lie out of their reach, helping them grasp what once was only the impossible? It is people like this that attribute towards a companies long term standing, and without them, fulfilling the founders end goal will be much more difficult.",1412584361

Ts&#x27;o was correcting Lortie&#x27;s misunderstanding of that documentation.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg38774.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg38774.html</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg38778.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ext4/msg38778.html</a>",1412583025

Its a breath of fresh air! No bloat, no evil, gets the job done - Not to mention some lovely features such as <i>Full</i> (no unencrypted boot slice) disk encryption via softraid, a completely unprivileged X server (with KMS supported GPUs), and a brilliant set of simple and solid daemons included in the base system.<p>The only time I&#x27;ll switch away is to use linux - The two reasons there being 1) High-end Gaming, 2) Virtualization.",1412582959

If the pay needs to be higher, that should be codified by law.<p>I would oppose a protest asking Bill Gates (whom I do not particularly like, btw) to pay more at the grocery store for same services as anyone else just because he can, regardless of whether the person at the register is making a living wage or not. And facebook paying drivers more is similar.",1412582712

I have seen how cultural bias is mitigated on these and other tests, a battery of stats are run on the raw item scoring and if a question is found to disproportionally punish a particular group captured in the demographics section, the question is thrown out of scoring even if the reason isn&#x27;t clear on review.",1412582690

In Scandinavia cash is really uncommon.<p>EDIT: Ok, so you&#x27;re talking about debit versus credit card? That&#x27;s a different story but then I don&#x27;t understand how you see Square as US centric. It applies to debit cards as well as credit cards. The reason it won&#x27;t work in Europe is because most countries here require chip (see iZettle for a competitor with support for chip).",1412582527

I regularly buy stuff on card, but always debit if I can help it, and I would assume that that&#x27;s also the case in the France.<p>I grew up in The Netherlands and I&#x27;m living in Italy now, and credit cards are generally viewed with suspicion. I didn&#x27;t get a credit card until a few years ago when I needed one to live in the US.<p>A lot of people that I know are uncomfortable with credit cards. I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s because they&#x27;re associated with fraud; banks here don&#x27;t make it easy to file reports in general. My card was used fraudulently for the first time a few months ago and it took A LOT of paperwork for my bank to accept that I hadn&#x27;t made the purchases.<p>I&#x27;ve always wondered if it&#x27;s a coincide that Paypal, Square, Google Wallet, Apple Pay etc. are all US-based, or whether it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t address a significant pain point this side of the Atlantic.",1412582515

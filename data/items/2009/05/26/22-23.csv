It'll never legally become one but once your brand has reached genericized trademark status you have a lot of brand power. And that brand power is even more powerful online. It's one thing if you have a store shelf where Kleenex and generic kleenex are right next to each other. It's different if you're sitting at a computer thinking, ""what site am I going to use to google for facial tissues?"".<p>There's a marketing concept--I've forgotten what it's called--where people will think of a small number of brands for a given category. If a brand gets in your brain this way it's viable. That's why we see so many silly commercials that just say things like ""Nike"" with some sort of vaguely inspiring imagery, or irrelevant things like polar bears advertising Coca-Cola. It's not a matter of actually convincing anyone to <i>buy</i> the product, it's just to get their attention and get the brand name in their working memory, so the next time they think ""I need to get new sneakers"" or ""I want a fizzy drink"", their brain will enumerate the possible brands and something constantly shoved into their mental attentions like Coke will come up instead of RC Cola, even though they're next to each other on the same shelf.<p>With search engines, Google is in the enviable position of being the <i>only</i> search engine that comes to mind. No one thinks anymore, ""I need to go to a website that will help me find fizzy drinks on the internet. Which sites do that? Ask Jeeves? Google? Windows Live Search?"". They just think, ""I'm gonna google me some fizzy drinks"".",1243376954

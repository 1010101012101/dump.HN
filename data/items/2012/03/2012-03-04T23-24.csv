Imagine that we did not have any kind of email. We invented computers, and computer networks, but somehow, incredibly, overlooked inventing email.<p>In this hypothetical world, people still communicate by writing letters, and sending them through the post office. Of course they write the letters on computers in word processors, and then print them, and it is the print outs that they mail.<p>Now, imagine in this hypothetical world that someone finally comes up with the idea of email, and pitches it as an electronic equivalent of regular mail that is faster and more convenient. Is he going to make it plain text only? Of course not. It will need to be as capable as physical mail, which means it needs to support sending anything that people can print on paper. That means some kind of rich format that can handle different typefaces and fonts, colors, inline images, and attached documents.<p>Email started off plain text only simply because when it was invented the technology wasn't up to the challenge of handling the presentation features of real mail.

There are people who want to learn programming for the sake of programming, just like there are people who like learning math even though they don't see immediate practical applications.<p>I teach programming to a tiny class of 10-12 year olds on Saturday mornings, and have taught a couple one-off classes at Stanford's Splash program to a classes of a dozen students. I've found that having an end-goal in mind of what they will create is a much better hook than just explaining what for loops are (or the idiosyncrasies of the languages are, which Python & Ruby are good about keeping to a minimum.)<p>I don't think graphics and cute cartoons are needed to make programming engaging either. My book ""Invent with Python"" has games that use ascii text up until the last few chapters. There's a pretty low standard for games/programs that are cool enough to show off to other people, but nobody ever shows off code snippets.<p>I think the best thing about ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" over a book like O'Reilly's ""Learning Python"" is that your book cuts it down to the bare concepts: ""Type this. This should appear. This is what is happening."" That's great compared to most computer books where there are paragraphs upon paragraphs that could be whittled down to a single sentence or cut out entirely. ""Learn Python the Hard Way"" is barely over 200 pages. That's much more digestible than some 600 page tome.<p>I just think that many classes where the students aren't CS majors or necessarily dedicated to learning programming forget that it's not just the concepts that people want to learn but what they can make using those concepts. Small games and web apps are great for that. Like in Exercise 22 of your book says, ""Its important when you are doing a boring mindless memorization exercise like this to know why. It helps you focus on a goal and know the purpose of all your efforts.""",1330902045

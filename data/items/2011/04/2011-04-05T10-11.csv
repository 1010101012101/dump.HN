It's a complete non-sequitur and doesn't make sense.<p><pre><code>    Sure it's dumb legislation, but blame the \n    politicians for failing their job\n</code></pre>\nActually I blame the people that voted for those politicians. Those politicians are only doing what was promised in their campaigns -- and it's the people's fault that politicians need big and costly campaigns to get elected, making them seek sponsors in return for favors.<p><pre><code>     Patent protection and lobbying are not exactly \n     MS invented tactics. Both exist because the \n     legislative system allows for them.\n</code></pre>\nIf a bully from your school kicks you in your balls, that makes it right because other bullies do it too?<p>Great way of pointing out how much the situation sucks, btw. Yes, it's not Microsoft's fault, it's the fault of their customers that tolerate, excuse or applaud such behavior, without thinking that this hurts the economy and ultimately everybody.<p>And btw, in this reply I haven't mentioned ""open-source"" once, as this is a problem far bigger than that, IMHO.",1302000294

Well, consider a US carrier offering an Android handset: under the new laws, they would effectively be required to prove that not only did they not use any pirated Microsoft software, but that none of their suppliers did either. And given that many of those suppliers are likely to be in China, where piracy is not completely unknown, the chances that at least one supplier is in fact using the odd dodgy copy of Windows or Office is probably somewhat close to 1.<p>But it goes much further than Android. One of the biggest growth areas for Linux is consumer electronics. Many of the most exciting low-cost digital consumer products are running stripped-down and customised versions of Linux at their heart – and not Microsoft's Windows CE. Again, retailers and importers of those Linux-based systems would need to be able to prove that not a single one of their suppliers had a single pirated copy of Microsoft products anywhere. If they couldn't, Microsoft could effectively block the import of those products into the US states that have passed this new legislation.""",1301998808

And, really, what person is going to both discover and use Thunderbird if their primary interface with the world is Facebook? They probably find Facebook by typing it into Google every morning.<p>Worse would be if they were talking about actually making the whole facebook experience part of Thunderbird. That you could not only communicate through Thunderbird via the Facebook messaging service, but actually read and post ""wall"" updates. Talk about feature bloat.<p>(I know there's no reason to expect that they're going to do this - it's all speculation . . . though I'm sure if it's not going to be part of Thunderbird, it'll become part of Firefox).<p>When you get to the point that you're facilitating status updates on services through an email client, is it still just about communication? Twitter certainly isn't as much about communication as it is pimping your company or self (or persona) to the world. A rather one-sided ""look at me"" conversation.<p>At that point, I don't know how we determine what Thunderbird <i>shouldn't</i> facilitate. Should it provide a customized interface to updating your Wordpress website? Or your Drupal site? (I know some things have APIs that let you just send an email to a service and have the data added to it, such as the add-by-email functionality that pinboard.in has - but I think we're talking about specific added functionality beyond that in the client).<p>Where do we then differentiate the browser and the email client? It starts to sound like Thunderbird isn't so much an email client for email communications, but that Firefox as a ""receive"" device and Thunderbird is a ""send"" device.",1301998666

2410361,comment,2409411,2409411,2,0,gavinballard,,,"It's really interesting to see that so many HN readers describe themselves as ""self-taught programmers"". I would describe myself as that as well, despite just graduating from university last year with a Software Engineering degree (at my university, Software Engineering is a four-year degree that's essentially a superset of a Computer Science degree).<p>I think the use of labels in this instance are not helpful. A person who hasn't touched a piece of code before they enter university is unlikely to magically become a great programmer in the course of three or four years. Indeed, my first-ever submission to HN was spurred on by a bit of disgruntlement at the quality of some of my peers (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1902687"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1902687</a> - not much in the way of discussion :).<p>My opinion on what you might get with a degree that you would be less likely to get without formal study:\n> More study of development processes and tools (this might apply more to SE than CS)\n> More study of the broad theory of computation\n> Earlier exposure to team programming (this comparison is clearly with ""self-taught"" programmers that aren't working in the industry)\n> Much, much more cruft that you're not really interested in :)<p>I'm personally glad that I studied SE at a tertiary level. It balanced out my other degree, it was a good way to meet other like-minded folks (and to compare my own skills against them), and perhaps most importantly I was exposed to a lot of stuff that I feel I wouldn't have sought out on my own. That said, I would feel it the height of presumption to ""look down"" on a programmer with a lack of degree. I know firsthand that a piece of paper does not make you a good programmer, and vice versa. The real determinant of how good a programmer you are is how good a programmer you are.",1301998398

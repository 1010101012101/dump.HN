But I'm not sure if that distinction would have been meaningful to most users.<p>The Apple HIG on Modifier Keys doesn't give much in the way of rationale for Command versus Control, except to say:<p>> Because the Control key is already used by some of the universal access features as well as in Cocoa text fields where Emacs-style key bindings are often used, it should be used as a modifier key only when necessary.",1283457018

Dating websites have a lot more competition and are probably closer to $50/customer.<p>2) Lifetime Value.  Customers of dating websites are transient, there only for a matter of months.  As such, their lifetime value is not particularly high (I'd guess something in the $150 neighborhood).  Netflix customers have long lifetimes (I've been a customer since 2000, with no intention of quitting) which adds up to a LOT of value.<p>3) Customer Price Elasticity.  Dating websites are catering to people who will spend many hundreds of dollars on dates in their pursuit of happiness.  $30/mo is a drop in the bucket if it helps increase your odds of finding that somebody.  Netflix charges between $10 and $30/mo, depending on your plan, which is comparable to the cost of a few premium channels on cable, which is a cost their customers are accustomed to paying.<p>4) Price as value.  If Netflix is more expensive, it does nothing to help you, it just costs more.  If Match.com is more expensive, then the people on the site are likely to treat it a bit more seriously, which can make it a better product for some.",1283456698

Think of your thin-client AGPL-using webapps as if they were thick-client GPL-using desktop apps, and the requirements are roughly the same.<p>That still leaves the same grey areas as in the GPL, which seems to be some of your questions: what exactly counts as an API, what counts as a derivative work versus a separate piece of software that communicates, etc.<p>The intention though is usually to require you to AGPL any SaaS you build on top of the original AGPL'd code, the same way the GPL would require you to GPL any thick-client app you built on top of GPL'd code. That effect is usually intentional, because AGPLing code is sometimes used as an alternative to not releasing it at all. For example, Dropbox keeps their source code closed, partly to keep someone from being able to build a competing SaaS on it. Some people choose to AGPL it instead, as an in-between sort of route: people can now build a competing SaaS on your code, but they have to open-source any improvements, which you can then incorporate back into your own service, so at least they can't leapfrog ahead of you using your own code.<p>I'd recommend that if your goal is to build a SaaS that has significant portions of its source code stay closed-source, you probably shouldn't use AGPL'd code.",1283455765

School teaches you how to deal with other children of the exact same age in the artificial environment of a school. This is an exceptionally poor environment to learn socialization in.

Before homeschooling there is no way that you could have convinced me that some hair brained idea like let you kids choose what they want to do would ever work.<p>It has changed my perception of how children learn now. My 4 year old is putting together robots and working out logic with a Lego Mindstorm, set and my 12 year old is well into Algebra and rivals any professional graphic artist or digital media professional I have ever seen.<p>Most of the kids that we know in the homeschooling and unschooling social circles enter into collage at between 14 and 16 years of age. Something is obviously working here.",1283454545

1657234,comment,1656510,1656510,0,0,tptacek,,,"This is a wildly editorialized and misleading article.<p>Here is the gist of what Ars Technica is saying: the OAuth ""consumer secret"" exists as a sort of obscured ""user-agent"" string, a ""hint"" to Twitter about what client you're using. Because end-users can usually recover the consumer secret easily by basic reverse engineering techniques, there's no security in them, and therefore they shouldn't be relied on for anything.<p>Well, almost. But before you get there, note what Ars Technica hasn't reported: <i>anything an appsec professional would term a compromise in Twitter's OAuth security system.</i><p>The issue here isn't that attackers can violate OAuth security. It's that Twitter may want to use the OAuth consumer secret as a way to revoke OAuth access to suspect applications. The claim here is that devious malicious people will steal the consumer secrets from popular native applications, abuse them in some overtly scammy way, and get those native apps cut off from Twitter.<p>That's maybe true as far as it goes, but it ignores the fact that Twitter would face this same problem in a myriad of other ways even without OAuth. It also shellacs Twitter for the failings of OAuth, which was intended to facilitate cooperating <i>web applications</i>, where the consumer secret really does provide some benefit, because it's hidden on web servers that attackers can't readily access.<p>(Incidentally, native app developers can simply keep consumer secrets on their own servers, which seems to me like using OAuth the way it was designed to be used, rather than as magic cross-platform authentication pixie dust, which it simply isn't).<p>Has Twitter done everything right here? Probably not. They're the ones promoting OAuth as the preferred standard auth method. The documentation could be clearer as well. But nothing they've done merits an article that suggests they've fielded a bona fide security flaw because of how they handle OAuth.<p>The rest of the claims in this article --- particular the last page's worth of complaints about obscure errors --- be aware that when it comes to (psuedo-)crypto authentication protocols, it's pretty easy to get dinged for having distinguishable error messages. The best practice is: be as vague as possible whenever possible. At best, Twitter could maybe do a better job with error reporting on a staging server developers could use to prove out their OAuth support. But that's hardly a news story.<p>I'm prepared to be wrong about anything here. But I think Ars got this one wrong.",1283454244

  Every new developer adds .25% of value to the company minimum.  Higher caliber people in the same position will add .35% of value.  So your equity range, per developer, will be .25%-.35% (in this example).",1239885975

You could dump all the text I've put in square brackets:<p>[Hi!  Thanks for contacting 3mindMe.com, here are some instructions to get you started:]<p>Quick reference:
    help@3mindme.com    - Emails you back this information
    <when>@3mindme.com  - Emails you at <when>
    echo@3mindme.com    - Emails you at the <when> specified in the Subject:<p>Quick examples:
    tomorrow@3mindme.com        - Emails you in 24 hours
    5pm@3mindme.com             - Emails you at today 5pm (in your timezone) 
    5pmPSTtomorrow@3mindme.com  - Emails you tomorrow at 5pm PST
    2days@3mindme.com           - Emails you in 48 hours<p>What does 3mindMe.com do?
Basically, we're a gateway to your future self: email us anything, and we'll mail it back to you at a future time and date of your choosing.<p>[How much does it cost?
Nothing!  This is just a fun project for me.]<p>[put this on a separate page]
What's new? (updated 2008/5/3)
Hooray, the first update not for timezones!  Unfortunately, it's for spam.  Luckily, I did something really tricky, so I'm hoping it won't be a problem...  If you do get any spam via 3mindme, let me know.
[/put this on a separate page]<p>How do I use 3mindMe.com?
There are two primary ways:
- Email <when>@3mindme.com and your email will be reflected back to you at whatever time or date you specify.
- Email echo@3mindme.com and it'll be sent back to whatever time is set in the Subject line<p>[What do you mean by ""<when>""?]
You can construct your <when> in three steps:<p>[1) Ask yourself ""When you want your email sent back to you?""]<p>2) Write that down just as you'd say it out loud, for example:
    friday
    tomorrow noon
    next tuesday at 5pm PST
    2 weeks
    5 minutes before January 1st 2008<p>3) If you're emailing echo@3mindme.com, you're done!  Just put that on the Subject: line of the email and send it, and it'll be sent back to you at the time and day you picked.  For example, you could make the subject:
    5 minutes before January 1st 2008: Get champagne, quick!!<p>4) Alternatively, just take all the spaces out and stick @3mindme.com on the back, and mail to that.  For example, the above ones would be converted to:
    friday@3mindme.com
    tomorrownoon@3mindme.com
    nexttuesdayat5pmPST@3mindme.com
    2weeks@3mindme.com
    5minutesbeforeJanuary1st2008@3mindme.com<p>[put this on a separate page]      
Do you store my mail?
Only as long as it takes to deliver it.  After it's sent back to you, the mail is deleted.
[/put this on a separate page]<p>[What's with the crappy name?
Ya, 3mindMe.com doesn't exactly roll off the tongue, but all the good names were taken.  Please don't hesitate to email me suggestions at dbarrett@quinthar.com.]<p>[put this on a separate page]
Who are you?
I'm David Barrett, and you can read more about me at <a href=""http://quinthar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://quinthar.com</a>, or just email me at dbarrett@quinthar.com.

Then at the appointed time your email is sent back from their system.  Emails are usually prompt, and they probably assume a flight time of seconds.<p>If I'm right then the system will work pretty well almost all the time.  It's a simple but great/fun idea.  Their ability to interpret times may be taken from something like the *n?x ""at"" command, but it looks quite nice.<p>Don't rely on this working to sub-minute accuracy, though.  Email flight times can be significantly longer when things go wrong.<p>But I like it - I may well be using this.",1239885440

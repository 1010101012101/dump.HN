It <i>is</i> a case of the government taking a settlement because they are afraid of losing in court, but everyone knows that stock prices are artificial and that the media can manipulate them.<p>That's why I don't get the recent anti-speculation sentiment.  The stock market was never about value-investing, it's about speculation.  Everything is speculation -- when you put money in a CD, you are speculating that the bank is not going to become insolvent and lose your money (and that the insurer is also not going to become insolvent).  That's why you get the interest rate premium over treasury bonds.  Now, you may argue that you're less likely to lose money in your savings account than in betting that Google will drop to $1 a share, and you're right... but it's all about degrees.  Every decision you make is speculation.  The market is all speculation, either people speculating, or people's algorithms speculating.  Nothing more.",1276408534

If there's a code and you have to respond, you can't just drop a tablet in your pocket and run. If you leave it at the nurse's station at the county hospital, there's every reason to assume some gangbanger visiting his gangbanger buddy will take it. If you're going to the OR, there is precious little horizontal space where you can safely lay something down, or even lean it. Everything in an OR is on wheels, and is likely to get sprayed with some fluid, before, during, or after the case.<p>I also think authentication will need to get lighter and more responsive. I think thumbprint detectors in the margin would be ideal. Pick it up and login. Logout if it sits without input for 2 minutes.

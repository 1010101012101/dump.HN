9369232,comment,9368031,9369066,0,0,rwcarlsen,,,"I think you mean fissile instead of fissionable [1].  Current reactor technologies consume a very small fraction of fissionable material.  Reactors discharge nearly as much fissionable material as they take in.  And the lifetime of uranium resource is highly dependent on the price you are willing to pay.  Seawater contains enough uranium to supply all reactors in the world at current consumption rates for ~60,000 years [2] estimated to only be about 8x the current spot price [3].  Using fast reactor technology that has already been developed and researched heavily could also stretch the resource by another factor of 100X or more.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material#Fissile_vs_fissionable"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fissile_material#Fissile_vs_fi...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-global-uranium-deposits-last/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-long-will-glob...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium#Seawater"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak_uranium#Seawater</a>",1428947977

There&#x27;s just too much room for selection bias (i.e., did they apply their methodology to every play written between 1550 and 1620 to see how many false positives it resulted in? What if the use of function words in the Shakespeare corpus was less distinctive than they imagine?) Though to be fair, I think that language like &quot;proven&quot; is being added by journalists interpreting the study rather than the authors themselves. It&#x27;s certainly an interesting lead for future research into the provenance of the play, at any rate.",1428947925

In a way, it&#x27;s sort of a role-play, with all the different &#x27;factions&#x27; on /r/thebutton collectively assigning meaning (in the form of mock religions) to the button itself.  I don&#x27;t think &quot;screaming&quot; is really the vibe- it&#x27;s playful, because in the absence of any real meaning, any meaning for what a &quot;player&quot; chooses to do (not click, click, click at a certain time) can be almost completely made up.<p>Look at it like a very simple role-playing game.  When you play D&D, your roleplay has to fall within the constructs of the world and the story.

9369225,comment,9367298,9369095,0,0,garrettr_,,,"Best practice would be to use an HSM to store the key. It provides the usability benefits of an unencrypted private key with strong guarantees about the security of that key.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the security benefits of encrypting the private key are limited in most cases. Whenever the server restarts, the private key is decrypted and stored in memory, so an attacker who can exploit your web server would be able to access it anyway. Some attackers might not be able to access memory (e.g. exploits in a web application), but in that case you should be able to use standard file permissions to protect the key.<p>Encrypting the key would have more benefit if you are planning to store it in places other than the server it is used on, and/or transfer it across a network. In that case, it&#x27;s probably best to carefully consider your threat model and security requirements, rather than solely relying on the default encryption provided by OpenSSL. For example - do you have the discipline do use a strong, unique passphrase on that key? If not, encrypting the key doesn&#x27;t provide much protection against a determined attacker. Is stretching performed to slow down a brute force attacker? And so on...",1428947891

Norms for cyber warfare and international cyber activity to be developed. (The US may not be able to lead this post-Snowden, but they should try and should be involved.)<p>2. Cooperation on international standards, development and funding in cyberspace to improve and prove the security of networks, protocols, hardware and software.<p>3. Deescalation of cyber capabilities and activities. These exercises can be expressed in many ways such as &#x27;cyber-free days&#x27; where nations show their good intentions by withholding operations in good faith.<p>4. International investment, development, data sharing and standardization of forensics capabilities to squeeze the attribution problem. This may be done in lockstep with protocol development.<p>But at its root there are three reasons nations hack one another: intelligence, intellectual property, sabotage.<p>Whatever deterrents and legal frameworks are in place will need to be as or more compelling than the motivations for cyberactivity.

Just because the copyright owner can sue whoever distributed the first copy doesn&#x27;t mean piracy would stop after that. In order to get any effect at all, they would have to tell every customer about it, and the effect would likely not be 100%. It only take one person who upload the song to make it a permanent resident in torrent swarms.<p>If someone were to use this, the profit calculation is 1: Can winning lawsuits cover the costs, 2: Can informing (accusing) all your customers be worth the decreased rate of uploads. If neither of those 2 sound attractive to your business model, then spending money/reputation on personalized watermarks is completely pointless.<p>(edit) additionally, lets look at a typical scenario. Let say a file is being spread unlawfully and you track down it to customer 40#. The customer is a hardcore fan, studying for a music degree, and has no idea how the song &quot;got out&quot; when confronted. Customer 40# is against piracy, as can be seen by the major library of lawfully bought copies. However, they are also a member of a small fangroup, and did share the song with its 10-20 members. The customer was sure that everyone in that place would never think of uploading it to a public place.

There&#x27;s variance, and sometimes you do get stumped, so it&#x27;s a bit stressful, but at least you have some kind of prior history as a guide.  But surprisingly often, it turns out to be something like encountering a rubik&#x27;s cube for the first time.   How long does it take to solve a rubik&#x27;s cube?  Well, once you know how to solve one, it takes less than 5 minutes.  How long does it take to figure out how to solve one when you&#x27;ve never encountered it?  Well, for some, never.

It was not really part of the logic of teaching.  It could have been done without reference to fingers at all; e.g., &quot;Could we have a math system if we only used two numerals, 0, and 1?&quot; but that would not likely have piqued the interest of third graders very much.  And actually some students might have taken issue with the ten fingers/ten numerals idea, since &quot;zero&quot; as a numeral screws that up.  E.g., our number groupings in written, columnar form really go from zero to 9, and then 10 to 19, 20 to 29, etc.  You don&#x27;t count zero things on your fingers....",1428946031

The earth maintains a fairly constant temperature below approx. 4-6 feet and so as long as your home is insulated well, you would not find it fluctuating so wildly as you suggest.<p>Cooking by fire takes a bit of practice, but even that is easy with some practice. Admittedly, this in many cases isn&#x27;t considered renewable, but you can remove a cord of wood (approx. 85 cu. ft.) per acre per year without ever depleting your supply. People in Northern climes claim they require 5-6 cords to get through their winters, but with a well insulated and geothermally &quot;heated&quot; house, you could reduce this fairly effectively. A wood gasifier can be used to drive gas burning engines - I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d recommend it for cooking due to potential CO output - you certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to use it for cooking inside the house.<p>We have an abundance of energy all around us and while the technologies that harness this energy aren&#x27;t perhaps as efficient as we&#x27;d like yet, they&#x27;re efficient enough that harnessing a bunch and wiring them together with a battery bank, charge controller and power inverter is enough that you can power your home sustainably with a much reduced need for fossil fuels. There&#x27;s certainly enough for lights (especially if you&#x27;re running all LED lights) and T.V.<p>For the moment, portability of tools and machinery (think chain saws, sawmills etc.), the need for gasoline still isn&#x27;t removed completely - you could go back to a felling axe and use your own energy, but trust me, as time gets on, you&#x27;ll realize you spend an awful lot of time rushing to beat winter and wasting time doing things that are done far quicker with power tools. We&#x27;re now at a point where you can comfortably live off-grid and (mostly) power your home with sustainable energy without giving up too many off the creature comforts you&#x27;ve come to take for granted. With some efforts to reduce your reliance on modern appliances - such as dishwashers, dryers, hairdryers, electric stoves etc. a modest battery bank would be enough to have enough electricity on demand to keep you running relatively normally.<p>I think there&#x27;s a difference in living sustainably and using fossil fuels.

The smarter plan is to add or subtract 1 randomly (or do nothing) in order to <i>match</i> the LSB to what you want; this symmetry is harder to detect (but still very possible, the methods are just more complicated).<p>The reason you encrypt the data is not just for data security, it is so that the embedder does not have to worry about the data that they are embedding screwing everything up.<p>tl;dr LSB steganography does not give you any plausible deniability because it&#x27;s really easy to detect in any type of image at very low embedding levels due to inherent limitations of the process. If you want to use it, you&#x27;d be safe with a single message at perhaps a level of 0.005 bits per pixel, but then in a ten megapixel image you&#x27;d get 150kB of data which hardly seems worth it when you have to transmit losslessly. Even then, you&#x27;d still be screwed at a theoretical level with Ker&#x27;s square root law.",1428945785

You&#x27;ll get 3-5 times more done, because most office environments are horrible and anti-productive, but you&#x27;re basically stepping out of the political fight. There&#x27;s so much nonverbal subcommunication that you&#x27;ll miss about who&#x27;s viewed as a top performer, who&#x27;s not, who&#x27;s ascending and who&#x27;s not.<p>The social environment of most workplaces is Meritocracy By Assertion. It has to conceive of itself as a meritocracy but the politically successful people are always most able to make themselves seem to have the most merit. No one ever said, &quot;I&#x27;m promoting this guy because of his political success&quot;. And yet... over time, what we see is that non-WFHers rise up the ranks, because it&#x27;s just such a political environment to be in the office during normal working hours, and, in general, when they get to the top, they&#x27;re hostile to the whole concept. So then you have places like Yahoo where, even if you don&#x27;t care about climbing the executive ladder, you have to adopt behaviors of those who do (namely, avoiding WFH).<p>The really depressing thing to learn about organizational politics is that, while they&#x27;re a grind for hard-working, decent people, they&#x27;re actually <i>fun</i> for psychopaths. About 95 percent of people will be utterly miserable if they have to spend 90 hours per week in a packed, open-plan environment. The other 5%, mostly psychopaths, thrive on that shit, like the creatures that live in deep-sea thermal vents (extremophiles). It energizes them.<p>You see this in <i>The Wire</i>. Stringer Bell doesn&#x27;t love &quot;The Game&quot; (meaning criminal enterprise). He plays it because he&#x27;s good at it and is trying to work his way out of it, but Marlo (and, to a lesser degree, Avon) is a natural gangster just as much as McNulty and Kima are natural cops. Natural office politicians are the 5% who don&#x27;t start to fade and fail when subjected to 90-hour weeks in open-plan bullpens, for the same reason that polar bears don&#x27;t mind ice. Eventually, though, an organization ends up full of natural politicians and has lost the whole &quot;vision thing&quot;.<p>Most organizations think that it&#x27;s valuable to &quot;be tough&quot; and schedule meetings during weird hours and cram developers together and set unrealistic deadlines. But the people who thrive in such environments aren&#x27;t &quot;the best&quot; in terms of the ability to get work done.

So, while you normally may be sharing IPs, if an enterprise customer&#x27;s website example.com starts getting attacked they will put it on dedicated IPs, then broadcast those IPs from one or two data centers. They will then reroute all other enterprise traffic away from those data centers, thus minimizing the attack effect on other customers. If these websites were all on the same IP, it would be impossible to distribute traffic selectively between data centers like this.<p>Another thing they can do is use anycast to load balance across data centers. So, if a data center rather than a website is a target - the attackers will need to know which IPs to attack. They can start flooding the broadcasted IPs from a particular route. However, if this happens then hypothetically Cloudflare could just stop broadcasting the IPs at this particular data center, re-broadcast them at all the surrounding data centers, and basically spread out the attack load across multiple sites. If the attackers change the IPs that they target based on new routes, then Cloudflare can continue fast-fluxing the IPs every 5 minutes  and mitigate the attack.<p>It&#x27;s pretty cool use of BGP and anycast, but being able to change IPs of website and where they are broadcasted in real-time is core to Cloudflare&#x27;s security.",1428945377

9368858,comment,9365252,9365503,0,0,Cacti,,,"Cooking food isn&#x27;t necessary, but there are distinct advantages to doing so, namely, it improves digestion. This may not seem like a big thing but it ends up significantly increasing the amount of calories one can absorb, massively expands the types of food one can eat, and greatly decreases the amount of effort one has to spend to process those foods.<p>Comparisons to other primates are illustrative: non-humans basically spend most of their life acquiring food, chewing it, and digesting it, at something like 85% of their entire waking lives. Cooking reduces that to roughly 10%, freeing up evolution to take advantage of that calorie and time surplus by, say, growing larger brains. In fact, studies of chimps suggest that almost their entire social structure is built around the tradeoff between eating, calories, and digestion---even a small change in habit (say, by doing something other than eating with a mere hour per day) significantly reduces calorie intake to a net deficit. Without cooking there is literally no time to do much else.<p>In fact, the most scientifically dependable and reproducible form of dieting is just to eat raw food.<p>It is becoming common now among anthropologists to hold the view that cooking food has had the single greatest impact on human evolution, even over hunter/gather, agriculture, meat, or any of the traditional attributed causes.

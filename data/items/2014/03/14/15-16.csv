7399684,comment,7398968,7398968,1,0,zeidrich,,,"You need to discover what is important to you.<p>You say that none of your jobs make you feel your passion, your joy.  But you haven&#x27;t decided what that is.  You&#x27;re looking for happiness, maybe you aren&#x27;t sure what happiness is.<p>You say you have ideas and goals of starting a company.  Why? What kind of company? Starting a (generic) company is not a very focused direction.<p>I think your issue is that you are afraid of choosing the wrong path.  Like a Hollywood romance, you&#x27;re expecting the right path to be self evident, and just feel perfect.  This isn&#x27;t going to happen.<p>My advice is to choose the wrong path. Walk down the wrong path, and while you&#x27;re doing it, try to work out exactly why it&#x27;s the wrong path. Make little corrections. It&#x27;s going to be when you&#x27;re walking down the wrong path that you learn what is right.  When you learn, tend toward what feels right. Don&#x27;t jump right on to another path, just correct a bit, because if you switch careers you&#x27;ll lose that context and feel lost again.<p>In the worst case scenario you&#x27;ll be in a career that you didn&#x27;t enjoy to start with, but one you&#x27;ve learned to make the best of, and have earned a lot of experience in.  In the best case scenario you will have discovered what you were looking for and learned how to get there.<p>Pick something that pays the bills, make the best of it, and try to figure out how you can make yourself a little bit happier there.",1394812746

Specifically, unless a program explicitly synchronizes via channels or mutexes, writes from one goroutine might be partly, entirely, or not at all visible to another, often with no guarantees about ordering of writes.[36] Furthermore, Go&#x27;s internal data structures like interface values, slice headers, and string headers are not immune to race conditions, so type and memory safety can be violated in multithreaded programs that modify shared instances of those types without synchronization.&quot;",1394812646

What they fail to mention is that $10 + $3.99 for 5-8 day shipping is not equivalent to $13.99 for 2 day shipping.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I love it, but I never once believed I was paying upfront for free shipping when I bought prime. I was paying for an upgrade to 2-day shipping.

7399651,comment,7398981,7398981,4,0,harshreality,,,"Buffet and his business partner Charlie Munger have a simple philosophy: You can&#x27;t make intelligent evaluations about everything, so focus on the (simple) things you can evaluate well, and pick the best of those to invest in.<p>It works well enough as an investment strategy, assuming the political landscape affecting the moral view of businesses doesn&#x27;t change radically, or at least it has worked well for the last ~half century.  It also means you end up investing in candy companies, sugar water companies (Coca Cola), sugar tomato sauce companies (Heinz)... (and did they invest in a tobacco company? I don&#x27;t remember, but Buffet was on record in the 1980&#x27;s praising the business model of big tobacco, even though he later changed his tune.)  Note the externalities and lack of vision: some major BRK investments are in companies that are rather bad for people&#x27;s health.<p>Buffet and Munger are very smart.  They know their limits, and they are fanatical about avoiding cognitive bias.  They&#x27;re very ethical within the small domain of their business.  However, they don&#x27;t concern themselves with, or dream about, the big picture.  They have avoided most tech companies, for good reason, but individual tech companies have flourished (e.g. Microsoft and Oracle, then Apple and Google, and now newer startups).  Being too complex to be favored by Buffet and Munger does not necessarily mean you will fail.<p>Seeing Buffet complain about bitcoin, I have to wonder why he&#x27;s warning investors about something he doesn&#x27;t understand (nothing against him; neither do I) rather than focusing on his core competency.  The sad answer, I fear, is that Berkshire Hathaway is in the politics business now because their business has gotten too unwieldy (which they&#x27;re honest about; they openly admitted long ago that returns would decline).  Slowing the decline in their rate of return is their business now, and that means playing politics.  Bitcoin, whether it&#x27;s viable or not, could be a threat to the economic establishment.  Therefore, it threatens Berkshire Hathaway, and rather than staying silent on the subject like he does about almost everything else he doesn&#x27;t understand, he makes a public statement against bitcoin.",1394812526

I started life as a Mechanical Engineering student and quickly grew to dislike the degree. I discovered that I did enjoy running projects and my school offered a degree in Engineering Management. It&#x27;s one of the few schools that has that degree AND is an ABET accredited program, its mostly a manufacturing based degree, my specialty was Industrial Engineering.<p>I digress...<p>My initial job out of school was operations for tin rolling mill, I quit before my first day. I switched to aerospace avionics/comms.  I guess I was really lucky in the fact that my department was really meant for gray beard engineers, and I did do a lot of grunt work. I was, and still am, a hybrid part business and part engineer. I&#x27;ve since moved through a couple of different positions but I&#x27;ve landed at a web agency as a technical project manager. In the beginning it was a lot a harder to find positions. Why? Not many companies are interested in Junior Project Managers. Despite the belief, being a good project manager isn&#x27;t easy and requires experience that&#x27;s not easily gained by hacking at some software in your undies (that&#x27;s my weekend hobby). Particularly dealing with clients, there&#x27;s no substitute for experience.<p>I&#x27;m a bit older than you, and I know that you feel fucked at 25, I did too. Ever job posting wants more experience than you have. Do the very best you can now to pick up those key responsibilities and accomplishments of a project manager. Make sure you resume resonates the level of responsibility.  I ran a $300k project 2 yrs out of school, which was a lot of money for my company. I made sure that was on my resume.<p>I&#x27;m currently looking to relocate to the Austin, TX area and for the first time, I&#x27;m telling companies that I&#x27;m not interested in them. Here&#x27;s why I&#x27;m now successful:<p>1. In small companies devs & design tend to dislike PMs, there&#x27;s a lot of bad ones out there, and a lot that have no clue. I&#x27;m pretty good with Linux and I can write some basic Django & Python scripts, but I&#x27;ve also managed some very nasty clients.\n2. It&#x27;s experience, I run about 4-5 projects at at time now.\n3. Just stick with it.<p>To give you an idea, I&#x27;m approaching about 6 yrs of work experience now. It&#x27;s been an uphill battle but nothing easy is worth having.<p>My suggestion to you is look for opportunities to grow your BA & PM skills, while your technical skills are important as well the focus for you should be the former. The technical skills are easier to pick up on your own.",1394812397

Not grinding beans, cleaning stale milk out, mopping floors and humphing inventory all over the place for basically minimum wage (in most cases.)  What do you actually want to do on a day-to-day basis?  If you like coding, then do that.  If you don&#x27;t, do something else.<p>If you want to code and don&#x27;t have the degree, get more technical and build your portfolio.  If you want to do product management (which sounds like a shout), then DO IT for a bunch of products - your own or someone else&#x27;s.<p>Edit:  I got more technical, but I don&#x27;t use it on a day-to-day basis for work - just to solve my own side-project-problems.",1394812335

Netflix is a tad popular in the US, here and there.<p>Hollywood has two major issues that&#x27;s aren&#x27;t faced by the music industry. The first is the theatrical release window: they&#x27;re tied in to a business model in pretty much every country worldwide where a significant chunk of their revenue comes from a system that relies on limited availability via a single method. This is changing, slowly. The window is shrinking and iTunes is being used to push out online releases prior to the DVD hitting retail. But it&#x27;s slow and will not go away unless there is some seismic change.<p>The second issue is international releases. Unlike music, films needs to be dubbed / subbed for releasing in many countries. This means staggered availability for most films worldwide (less so for the massive blockbusters which have resources thrown at them to ensure simultaneous release as much as possible to maximise the return from publicity), staggered retail windows, etc etc. It makes catch-all online release services more difficult to produce.<p>On top of all that? There are three (verging on two) major record labels worldwide (plus a bunch of indies who often operate quite well together). There are six major film studios in the US, seven if you count Lionsgate, multiple major studios in many individual countries, and persuading all of those to do the same thing at the same time and throw all of their films onto a Netflix-style service in every country worldwide....?

In the extreme form of that view they had a view on management that aligned nearly 100% with the view of the big capitalist &quot;barons&quot;. A common view among industrialists of the era (starting in the late 19th century) was that modern scientific management, statistics, supply-chain-management, etc., was making bazaar-style capitalism obsolete, and ushering in an era of efficient, centralized, vertically and horizontally integrated, scientifically optimized production. That was one of the arguments used against anti-trust legislation: industrialists argued that anti-trust legislation was just purposely shoring up obsolete, inefficient models based on the medieval bazaar, which were out of touch with a modern scientific, centralized industrial sector.<p>A certain variety of early Marxism said more or less: yes, we agree with all that. Except for one thing: once industrial capitalism has centralized the economy, with a few huge trusts running things as a smoothly oiled production machine, the shareholders are now more or less superfluous. So, we&#x27;ll just knock &#x27;em off and distribute the proceeds of this machine among all the workers equally. The industrial capitalists only disagreed with the idea of socialist central planning in that they didn&#x27;t want to distribute the proceeds of central planning, not in believing that decentralized planning was better. Many did agree that <i>some</i> kind of redistribution was necessary so that all society benefitted, but they preferred redistribution managed by the monopoly capitalists themselves in the form of philanthropy, which they felt they would be able to thoughtfully manage (Andrew Carnegie&#x27;s <i>The Gospel of Wealth</i> is representative of this view).",1394812067

In practice you can push those constraints a bit around and most of the time you can hide them in dark corners where nobody looks and nobody gets hurt, but there is no silver bullet and there will never be one. (The last paragraph might be interesting, too.)<p>I completely agree with you but I was a bit unclear about what I wanted to say. What I really wanted to say is that the problem is fundamentally unsolvable in the general case no matter how hard you try. The pathological case is that from some point in time on you capture less information than you did before - only the full name instead of first and last name.<p>This is admittedly a relatively rare case in practice but nonetheless possible. Now there is fundamentally no way to migrate data captured past that point back before that point because you just don&#x27;t have the necessary information and can not make it up out of thin air. As you mentioned it is not a big problem to migrate data captured before that point forward and backward by just keeping the additional information around and therefore making the migration step non-destructive.<p>In practice it should be a relatively rare case that you have to migrate data forward and backward repeatedly so the relevance of all that is not to high. Most of the time you start capturing additional information or stop capturing no longer relevant information and these cases behave much nicer under schema evolution. But especially when ever you change the way you capture some information you will from time to time get into trouble.<p>It is instructive to think of data migration in terms of mathematical functions. The function to migrate the data forward is always defined otherwise you could not perform the migration in the first place. But not every function has an inverse function and so you may not be able to migrate the data backwards. You can always make up a function that returns a tuple of the function value together with all arguments and therefore make inverting it trivial - this is exactly what also keeping first and last name around when you actually want to merge them into full name means - but as mentioned above this fails for new information where you only capture the function value and no longer the function arguments.",1394811917

Other than that, I don&#x27;t really imagine any feasible solution for communication on interstellar scale other than laser-based one, so my initial point was put forward exactly in that use-case. If there ever will (and I hope it will) be a galactic-scale communication system, humanity will have to:<p>- Improve the current laser technology to the point of sending laser beams without much dispersion over light-years distances.<p>- Improve the optical sensor technology in order to receive (and distinguish) from (multiple) artificial sources of light orbiting close to a noisy star.<p>- Set up the laser system(s) taking in account: the time-frame of the moving celestial bodies - both stars and the orbiting emitter(s)/receiver(s), the gravitational time dilation factor, other currently known factors that I don&#x27;t know of (I&#x27;m not a professional physicist), and whatever any other new additional subtle effect that may be still discovered in such setting! I think this fine calibration will be the cake&#x27;s top-cherry, BTW.<p>So yes, theoretically all is just an engineering problem. The development speed cycles of such systems though, are already dictated by the laws of physics - years (and in human time - generations).

I mean it appears in advocacy as a bullet point, but by itself it just isn&#x27;t that compelling. Especially given that so many developers do so much to distance themselves from JavaScript proper (TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc). The actual problem space on both the client and the server tends to be dominated by non-JavaScript related issues (e.g. the DOM, state, etc).<p>Node offered good performance, a decent model for asynchronous implementations (in an era when the PHP / .NET model was entirely synchronous. Every .NET advocate could point out some method of emulating what node does, but it was awkward and not at all idiomatic), and possibly more important than everything else it presented a platform that was a ground zero -- to get into it and start a project using best practices took an afternoon of learning, versus established platforms like .NET and Java where cargo culting and pseudo-best practices made even the most trivial of implementation a monumental task if you wanted to avoid raising the ire of others.<p>Since then other platforms have largely caught up. Even moreso, the way we develop apps have changed -- the server side isn&#x27;t a presentation layer, but instead is often merely a service layer. For that purpose some other technologies are often a better fit. Personally I&#x27;ve mostly transitioned to using Go on the service side, as the glorious glue that hooks information together.",1394811314

The big difference between electro-magnetism and gravity is, that you have positive and negative charge for EM and only positive charge for gravity. So you can not shield gravity, because the shielding can only add to the gravitational force, not subtract from it. A gravity occlusion in a similar way as most things are opaque does therefore not exist.<p>Reflection is tied to the electric properties of the reflecting material. [1] So there is no electric field in a conductor, otherwise the electrons would move around until there is no longer a electric field. This means that the field on the surface has also to be zero. So if a electro magnetic wave, light, hits the conductor it has to be reflected, since the energy has to go somewhere and it can not enter the conductor.<p>Refraction of gravitational waves, well that could be interesting. [2] In non-conductors a passing EM wave induces a EM field in the material, so called polarization. [3] This can be traced back to the large wave length of light compared to the length scale in the crystal lattice. It could well be, that you could generate interference patterns of gravitational waves, if the gravitational waves would pass through a similar arrangement of  point masses. ( But this would likely need hundreds of stars aligned on scales much smaller than a light second. )<p>[1] I am not sure, if the following is fully general. But it covers at least metal mirrors.<p>[2] I am basing my reasoning on a formal analogy between linearized gravity and the Poisson equation, it may be that it would turn out that refraction can not exist via a more subtle argument, like any such device would collapse into a black hole or something.<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density</a>",1394811301

7399428,comment,7398926,7398926,2,0,EGreg,,,"Um, am I the only one who considers Node.js a beautiful tool suited for developing servers?<p>Why async by default? Because defaults should encourage best practices. It can handle C10K problem out of the box. With libraries like Q, the code can actually be rather easy to follow and maintain.<p>One of the biggest reasons why a multi-user server should be coded in async-by-default style is as follows: often, you want to obtain objects and not care about how they are obtained. In procedural languages, this isn&#x27;t possible. Consider the following challenges:<p>1) Query sent to 10 different shards, wait until they all return, combine the results in the app, and then use them. In a synchronous language, you HAVE TO go to one shard, then another, then another, and the time is 10x longer. In an async style, it&#x27;s only as long as the longest query!<p>2) Some of the objects may have already been cached, whereas others need to be obtained. In addition, the ones that need to be obtained shouldn&#x27;t be requested more than once at the same time, but callbacks should be placed on a waiting list.<p>3) Various parts of your code (e.g. from different requests) might want to request the same object. Not only that, but you might want to batch your requests. That is to say, wait 10 milliseconds and see if any other (unrelated) parts of your code also want to grab some objects from the same DB table. Suddenly you are issuing a lot less queries because you can build middleware like this easily in JS. Not so in PHP for example - I would know. A lot is wasted there.<p>4) Let&#x27;s consider #1 some more. The queries may go to other HTTP endpoints - do you really want to wait that long for I/O? Furthermore, even if they are going to local MySQL shards, your site becomes slower with an extra factor of O(log n) with the number of users. Kind of like when you use a relational database instead of a graph database for one-degree-away lookups. It could have been O(1) but instead you introduced another factor of O(log n). Not terrible, but certainly gives you a 5-20x cost down the line.",1394810975

When you start a live render, we start a client on the server, but instead of translating the scene graph into WebGL, it translates the scene graph into V-Ray.  Any changes you make to the scene are sent to the server-side client using the same mechanism used to synchronize changes between 2 users editing the same scene.<p>If we used a different language in the front end and the back end, we would have ended up with a <i>lot</i> of duplication of effort.",1394810965

Feel free to contact me if you want to talk (email is in profile)<p>First off, I&#x27;m 29. I already feel like I&#x27;m a failure because I&#x27;m not Mark Zuckerberg rich at my age. Get in line!<p>> * I have ideas and goals of starting a company, but am unable to build everything myself, and lack the financial resources to hire anyone to help me.*<p>Great, so we&#x27;ve identified the main problem (I&#x27;ve been there!). Here&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve learned - people who are technical will respect you much more because you do have a technical understanding. So all is not lost in thinking that you can&#x27;t find someone to partner up with. Think of the whole technical/non-technical challenges like this: it&#x27;s like walking into a French restaurant and asking for a cheeseburger in English. If you are able to throw at least a rudimentary understanding of French (&quot;un cheeseburger, s&#x27;il vous plaît&quot;) you signal to the waiter that you want to talk on his level. This has less to do with your ability to speak fluently and more about respect of the person&#x27;s craft/culture. In my experience techies love this. You know what they hate? They hate non-technical people coming to them and saying &quot;Oh god that&#x27;s so easy, you should be done with it in 5 minutes&quot; or &quot;build the next facebook with me! it&#x27;s easy!&quot;. So you&#x27;ve already got a leg up on 90% of the people out there.<p>The most important thing here is to continue to search for what you enjoy. Some people find this at 18, some people find it at 60. Don&#x27;t be discouraged if your path isn&#x27;t equal to what you perceive everyone elses is. Stop reading TechCrunch dreaming about how or why you aren&#x27;t the next 30 under 30 who just raised $50m in VC funding. Just get out there and build stuff people like.<p>Good luck!",1394810595

So what I did was force myself to go through it. I did it a day a time, always thinking, &quot;tomorrow it&#x27;ll be easier, tomorrow it&#x27;ll be funner&quot;.\nAnd it eventually got easier and funner. My programming skills started to take off, and let me tell you. After a certain threshold, learning becomes fun, and exciting, and I found that I didn&#x27;t have to force myself anymore. It seems to me that beginner materials do not really provide people with inspiration.

Why not use Ruby or Python?<p>If you really want to force Node into being a dumb scripting engine, you could use the various sync functions that Node.js provides. Problem is, they block the entire thread. But if you want to, you can. And I believe with some clever hacks, you can use the blocking nature of (for example) the fs sync functions to make other calls (including http requests) synchronous as well. But unless you use Node to build something that&#x27;s not a server (people build command line tools with it as well), I don&#x27;t think you want to.<p>By using synchronous functions, everything Node is built for will go down the drain. Everything done will be done in sequence, and during the time the sequence of operations has not finished, the Node runtime will be unavailable to serve any requests.<p>I suggest you look into promises as a somewhat saner way to deal with asynchronicity than callbacks, although you can pretty far with just the Async library.

If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At $1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.<p>Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?<p>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.<p>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons).

7399203,comment,7397637,7397637,3,0,tyler-codenvy,,,"I have read the article and this thread with keen interest. I am curious to solicit community feedback on our choices as we faced the Node vs. Java choice in 2012. In particular, does our business ultimately suffer long term consequences by our stack choice?  We think we ultimately have strong advantages vs. any competitor built using Node.JS, but the beauty of HN is that we can open up the thoughts for everyone to contribute.<p>I am the CEO and founder of Codenvy.  We make SAAS developer environments, and have been working as a team since 2009.  Starting in 2012, we recognized the limitations of our initial system and needed to rebuild the entire system from the ground up.  We had three criteria: performance, security, and modularity (of our core base and an ability for ISVs / enterprise to plug-in their own customizations).  We raised $9M in Jan 2013, so we now have big investors and aspirations equally large.  Our target market is primarily enterprises and ISVs that build Eclipse plug-ins.  Individual developers and consultants are a secondary audience.<p>We chose to go with a pure Java stack, after a careful evaluation of Node.JS vs. Java. We wanted to provide some of our thoughts, as we continually ask ourselves whether there are downsides to the approach we chose. For the record, we have competitors like Eclipse Orion and Cloud9 that are pure JavaScript / Node implementations, but we are - as far as I have seen - the only Java implementation in our market.<p>Our team is currently 40 people, with 35 or so in R&D. Our engineers have experience with Java, Scala, JavaScript, AngularJS.  Prior to this project, most engineers were working on server systems for content and document management firms. The hard stuff: sync, versioning, correlation, and so on.  As for myself, my career started as a Java engineer in the 90s, but for the most part have been hands off as a technologist for a decade. My skills may have faded, but as a CEO, I am conversant.<p>We did 2 prototypes on Node.JS where the client and server were combined systems. We ran a battery of performance tests and did conclude that we could probably run a large scale system on fewer physical nodes with Node.JS than with Java, but the gains were not enough to justify the choice.<p>Our long term architecture was different from our competitors. Most SAAS dev environments provision each user / group their own VM, give you root access, and let you control that system.  We chose an approach that would optimize overall system density by by offloading builds, debugs, and editing onto separate clusters.  User environments will be virtualized and routed to the appropriate cluster on-demand.  The user will feel like they have a personal VM, but our elvish helpers route traffic between the nodes across performance queues.<p>After offloading LDAP (for identity), event / log management (for analytics), and cloud administration, the only core systems left was our API services (account / builder / runner / auth) and editing.  These core systems would be subject to heavy iterative development, and Node&#x27;s architecture could offer higher density of requests / users than Java, but by our tests the comparison was 10-20% difference, not 300%.<p>By way of scaling, for every 10,000 concurrent developers, we average 20 editing nodes (I/O constrained), 75 debugging nodes (memory constraining), 5 builder nodes (CPU constrained). A similar TS / VDI implementation would require nearly 5,000 nodes of the same shape / size to service the same population.<p>So, we saw a disadvantage to Java as we could have reduced our editing node even further. But we chose Java because:\na) The library selection.  Broad and mature. In particular, it&#x27;s data structures, file management, REST services.\nb) GWT. This library gave us cross-browser portability of code written in Java.  \nc) Eclipse Plug-Ins.  We knew we wanted to target Eclipse plug-in developers and saw the Orion project as optimized for Web dev, leaving a gap in Eclipse.  We saw it as a business gamble that Eclipse devs who needed to move their plug-ins would find a pure Java plug-in architecture that was similar to RCP more attractive than a newer (but have to learn new tech & rewrite) approach.\nd) Our history.  We did a straw poll of our engineers before we started. We asked them if they felt that they would rather do Node or Java, and 75% said that they would enjoy Java more.  When asked why? They had tool familiarity, were confident in the maturity of maven, and better job prospects.  This last one completely surprised me.\ne) JVM. The number of optimizations of the JVM would give us advantages for enterprise deployment.  We built our system to be automatically installable on-premises.  We do so with Puppet, but recognized that we would be encountering many IAAS and PAAS standards internally.  Enterprises had security and performance tested the JVM, so we saw an opportunity to win hearts and minds of system admins, datacenter architects, and security specialists by our choice of architecture.<p>So, we carried forward.  Since we started working on our next generation architecture, we have focused hard on the best practices associated with agile, devops, and continuous delivery. We have 7 teams of 4-6 people, each focused on a different aspect of our stack. We are able to release any Jira issue at any point in the day.  Each team can push into acceptance, staging or production without coordinating with the other teams. At the same time, we have achieved modularity and a rapid development tempo.  While we haven&#x27;t released our new system to the market yet, we find that the performance of the environment is similar to a desktop environment, and it scales cleanly with simulated load tests. We have also been able to give out our SDK (github.com/codenvy/sdk) to 6 different partners, some of which are Eclipse plug-in developers, who are able to code, build, test, integrate, and publish their plug-ins without complicated dependencies to our core team.  Their feedback was that the port of their plug-in took about 1/2 the time of the original development.  And there is no real way to estimate what the effort would be to do the same in a Node-based offering like Orion.<p>What we can&#x27;t measure is whether our competitors are able to release faster & more functionality than we are.  It seems like a crap shoot.  One other variable we can&#x27;t account for is the cost to maintain legacy.  The system we have Codenvy.com is legacy for us, and will be retired in Q3.  We have to continually allocate 3-5 people to work on bugs, special partner projects, or other related items to keep that system live while we also work to roll out the new system.  We know this is a drag, and some of our engineers think we may more than double our productivity once we consolidate to a single architecture.  I am a bit skeptical at that - but I find that it&#x27;s unwise to disagree with my engineers.  I tend to lose.<p>So at this point, we feel like we made the right choice.  But time will tell - we begin selling our enterprise offering earnestly once we ship our new system in Q2.<p>Looking forward to the discussion.",1394809518

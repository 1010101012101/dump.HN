This is going to be a fascinating B-school case study in a year or two.

Or is there an objective measure of deserving something, so that it may be a fact?<p>Maybe it&#x27;s not strictly a objective fact because their is no quantitative measure, if this is how my statement is interpreted by most people then it is my mistake.<p>This does not mean that that the entire argument makes no sense. Many things in life cannot be objectively measured or strictly defined. We all as human beings have the intuition to judge whether or not someone &quot;deserves&quot; something or not even when I don&#x27;t explicitly mention who does the judging. If I had said that &quot;a murderer deserves to be punished, this is fact&quot; would the argument still make &quot;no sense&quot;? No. It wouldn&#x27;t.<p>Let me put it this way, unless you&#x27;re a psychopath, I assume we all have the ability to judge who deserves and doesn&#x27;t deserve something and that ALL our judgements will be remarkably similar if viewed from an unbiased perspective. That is why I can say such statements without explicitly stating objective measures.<p>If you&#x27;re rich yourself I would say your judgement is remarkably biased and that you will take a more opposed or ambiguous view towards my statement about what rich people deserve. This occurs because people tend to almost always justify their own situation. This is a fact. Do I have an objective measure of this? No. Do I expect the average reader to be able to understand what I said despite lacking an objective measure? Yes.",1432216751

Because there is no buffering at the consumption side, the overall grid must be able to handle peak demand. That is, we must over-provision. With batteries everywhere, this isn&#x27;t necessarily the case. In theory, we could all have generators, but we don&#x27;t because they&#x27;re noisy, smelly, and a maintenance hassle.

And by definition the traffic behind you is more compressed than it otherwise would be, because you&#x27;re hogging tons of lead space all for yourself.  So you&#x27;re dampening the waves in front of you by making the waves that develop behind you even worse!<p>Given that the minimum amount of lead time drivers are comfortable with is constant, if you pour tons of cars into a highway at rush hour, traffic necessarily must slow down because there&#x27;s too many cars per mile of road to accommodate a safe lead time for each car at high speed.<p>So if everyone tried to smooth out traffic waves by leaving extra space in front of them, they&#x27;d effectively be making the number of cars that will fit in a mile of road even lower by artificially requiring more space for themselves.

My impression is that many of those regrets stem from spending too much time on things that others, rather than the self, find important in life.<p>Speaking for myself, there was a time in my life when I wanted to create and raise a family, wanted to own a house, because that&#x27;s what people told me I should do. Yet here I am in my 30s. I have a happy relationship that for various reasons isn&#x27;t aimed at having kids or owning property. I rent an apartment in a co-op community which, while it certainly offers its own challenges, also brings rich memories that I may not have had were I living in my own house in the suburbs. I&#x27;m bootstrapping a software company, which is significantly easier without a mortgage and 2.5 additional mouths to feed. And I&#x27;m happy. I wake up when I like, put in 20 or so hours per week of real work, then spend time reading or exercising or working on fun projects. That&#x27;s not to say I&#x27;m better than anyone else, and not everyone has the luxury to choose as I have. But I&#x27;d likely not be here, with the freedoms and lack of stress I have had I chosen the life others said I should, which is what I took away from reading this. And it&#x27;s not all easy. Sometimes I look at those of you who are younger and have done more in your 20s than I could ever imagine, and question my choices. Then I realize that my life brings its own rewards, and it&#x27;s good to externally be reminded of that sometimes. There are certainly plenty of other reminders that someone with my talents could likely be raking in lots of money right now if they pursued a different path, and sometimes those are hard to disregard. :)<p>Also, as someone who has chosen to not pursue the rat race, I often feel pushback and criticism from those who have chosen it, as if my choices directly threaten their own. If an article seems more boastful than maybe it should, perhaps it&#x27;s a reaction against having one&#x27;s personal choices questioned, dissected and ultimately put down by someone working 80 hours a week with a family to support and a mortgage to pay, attacking others with the Gaul to not have taken on those obligations.

I once taught a course like that, too, and I&#x27;m not proud about it at all. In order to appreciate the value of philosophy, you need to define it in a different way.<p>Philosophy is not a collection of knowledge, but a <i>way of life</i> that never tires of asking &quot;why?&quot;, uses the power of reason to figure out the answer, and tries to live according to that answer. In other words, the life of a philosopher is a life of criticism. It is a life of reflection, a life dedicated to developing and refining the one faculty that distinguishes us from all other animals.<p>I honestly don&#x27;t give a shit about any of the dead white guys that we call philosophers. Because the point of philosophy is not to learn who they were and what they said. The point is to learn the way of life that those people exemplified. The content doesn&#x27;t really matter; most of that is wrong anyway. The methodologies, however, are worth learning. How to spot a fallacy, how to construct convincing counterexamples, how to go about dissecting a tightly woven rhetoric so that it collapses as spectacularly as possible.<p>I think philosophy is to the mind what exercise is to the body. You don&#x27;t become an athlete by memorizing trivia about famous athletes; you become one by emulating their daily routines. Similarly, you don&#x27;t learn philosophy by memorizing what Descartes said; you become a philosopher by learning to think like him in everyday life and practicing it until you&#x27;re good at it.<p>STEM fields also help you train your mind, but usually in more specific ways.

I could work 40 hours a week, or more even, but I choose to work only 20 hours so I can work on other things of my own design. I do <i>not</i> spend the time &quot;in leisure&quot;, though I enjoy the work so much that it&#x27;s practically the same thing for me.<p>The Bill Watterson quote drives me up a wall. I can&#x27;t imagine doing nothing.<p>I live in Washington DC with my wife. I make slightly more than she does (though with taxes and her benefits it probably comes out even), and she made enough before meeting me to buy her own condo here in one of the most expensive areas of the country. I charge only about half of what other consultants with my experience and skill set charge. Neither of us makes six figures. Just shy, but not quite. Combined, our AGI was just under 200k.<p>By almost all accounts, we&#x27;re &quot;rich&quot;. We went on three international trips last year. We went on three other mini-vacations that were only possible because I can work from anywhere. I&#x27;m working two 40 hour weeks here this week and next, just so I can have a big chunk of extra cash that I can play with--I think of it as reverse-vacation, I get to choose to work more for spells of time. I&#x27;m buying a gaming laptop with it, and some parts for my desktop. I could afford it without the &quot;overtime&quot;, but this way I don&#x27;t even have to think about the budget. We also put in quite a bit of money to our retirement funds, and have excellent health insurance.<p>How is this possible? I know couples making $500k between the two of them that don&#x27;t get to go to all the amazing places we go to, because they&#x27;re constantly worrying about money. It&#x27;s because, for the rest of the year, we live in our means. Three international trips <i>was</i> in our means. Computers and electronic toys whenever we want them are in our means. If they weren&#x27;t, we wouldn&#x27;t have done them. We pay ourselves first (retirement funds). We don&#x27;t have a house larger than we need. We don&#x27;t have multiple cars (I don&#x27;t need a car, so we have only one. Our great credit has meant that it&#x27;s nearly paid off after two years, at an APR that has been less than inflation). We aren&#x27;t fashionistas, so we don&#x27;t drop money on clothing all the time.<p>Long story short, we just don&#x27;t go into debt. The only real debt we have is the mortgage on the condo. We work her travel mileage card, so most of our flights are &quot;free&quot;, in a sense. We just don&#x27;t overspend on recurring expenses.<p>A $350/mo car payment doesn&#x27;t sound like that much more than a $300/mo car payment, but it adds up! That&#x27;s $600 in one year that you could have spent on a graphics card, or on a longish flight, or on a nicer hotel, or on a rental car instead of buses.<p>A $2800/mo apartment rental doesn&#x27;t sound like that much more than a $2500/mo apartment, but it&#x27;s $3600 a year! That&#x27;s a brand new, uber powerful gaming computer every year. And you don&#x27;t even need to buy it every year.<p>The recurring expenses in your life are a lot more expensive than you think they are. They are a hell of a lot more expensive than most of the expensive, one-time purchases you&#x27;ll want to have in your life. Who needs a large house? Who needs 4 cars in a household of 2 drivers? Who needs a gigantic minivan or SUV for <i>one</i> kid? My parents drove my sister and me around in a coupe for most of our lives, making us squeeze past the front passenger seat to get in the back.<p>Even if you&#x27;re living alone, you could get a roommate, or an efficiency apartment. You don&#x27;t need a lot of stuff. I&#x27;d like to get rid of some of my stuff, and I don&#x27;t actually have a lot. What do you use on a daily or weekly basis? I submit that there is nothing you&#x27;d use on a monthly or yearly basis that you can&#x27;t rent more cheaply than own.<p>Don&#x27;t chase after high-paying jobs if they require you to drive somewhere. Cars are expensive, gasoline is expensive. So many people here drive an hour one-way to get to work. It beats up their cars so they replace them every 5 years. They feel like they have an image to maintain so they buy BMWs and Lexuses. Every 5 years, another 45 - 60k for the car, probably 10k in gasoline, probably another 10k in maintenance. Call it an extra 13k a year, to drive to work. No job is offering 13k more to come to the office. I make slightly more now, part-time, than I ever did full-time driving into office. I could be charging twice as much as I am now, and I could be working twice as much. But I choose not to, because it&#x27;s easy.<p>We&#x27;d have even more if I could convince her to move out of DC. I&#x27;m thinking we move to Pittsburgh, get a place <i>slightly</i> larger than our tiny condo, she quits her job, rent out the condo, sell the car, and we have more take-home than we did before.<p>Everything is so easy when you don&#x27;t have debt. Yes, we are &quot;rich&quot;, but for the types of skills that people on HN have, you should easily be able to achieve our sort of rich. Because our sort of rich happened because we first lived within our means and got out of debt. Once we got out of debt, it was easy to start holding out for the darling opportunities. When you don&#x27;t have debt, you aren&#x27;t desperate. You don&#x27;t have to take just any job that comes your way. And when you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to take just any job, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to move into a new place right away, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to buy a new car right away.

The result was a bit anti-climatic: peoples wages were consistent and fair, no big drama.<p>After switching jobs to another software consulting company Reaktor (<a href=""http://reaktor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reaktor.com</a>), I brought up this topic and the discussion was very similar. I decided to try a different route: I created a wiki-page called &quot;Voluntary salary information&quot; and added my name and salary to the top of the page. I then wrote a post to our discourse board explaining why I thought this was important. As of now there are 68 names on that list ( with only 1 obvious troll ) out of about 300 employees. Our head of HR replied to my discourse post with a detailed explanation of how peoples salaries are decided. Overall a great day for transparency.",1432214897

Also, ask Kepler owners about their current driver support in recent titles. They are not happy.<p>&quot;NVIDIA set out to optimize the game as best as they could for their hardware.&quot;<p>AMD helped optimise several titles that worked just as well on NVidia (excep that one Tomb Raider fiasco, what was solvable doe to the openly available TressFX code. Can we say the same about hairworks?). But somehow many NVidia titles are optimised in a fancy way that always hits hard on AMD cards (Crisis 2 and Batman AA come in as uncovered examples).<p>&quot;AMD didn&#x27;t set out to do anything: once again they sabotaged themselves by not getting involved.&quot;<p>I guess you can back up that statement.<p>Edit: wording, grammar",1432213703

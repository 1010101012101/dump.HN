You can&#x27;t arbitrarily write to their SRAMs.<p>An SOC has various bus arbitrators that are built into hardware which control the dataflow. It is part of the chip&#x27;s backbone. I&#x27;ve never seen an architecture in which you could easily write to the aux core&#x27;s SRAM. This is partially because those cores are often responsible for DRM therefore access to them is very restricted, but also because it is expensive (in terms of gates) and unnecessary to hang them off the main bus.<p>It is a very unlikely &quot;DMA hacking&quot; vector.<p>The peripheral can just as easily DMA to main memory and overwrite kernel code if the memory apertures are set wide open to allow peripheral to DMA anything into the host.

First of all, the scheduled activities happen when they happen. Second, some activities take more mental focus, it works best for those things to be done first. Third, activities such as music come before homework in terms of their value -- they represent gaps in the school curriculum, that we are filling in ourselves.<p>So, homework can come last for good reasons. Also, some activities require awake parents. ;-)<p>Now, about the 1am thing, that only happens roughly once a semester due to an exponential distribution of homework assignments.

I was wondering how you got the display onto the mirror and then I scrolled down and saw the monitor on the back of the silvered surface (doh-doi!)<p>A couple of suggestions:\n(1) Externalize the mic - either have it hook into your phone to listen to your voice or through some other mechanism - it will boost recognition accuracy significantly and allow you to do complex tasks\n(2) Better demo. I&#x27;d sure you could take this into school / work and film in a better lit location. If screen brightness is an issue, you could sand down the silvering right in front of the screen\n(3) If commercialization is your plan, look into Samsung&#x27;s new OLED tech that&#x27;s super skinny. \n(4) Android speech interfaces are easier and more flexible to program. And dead-simple to use\n(5) Find someone who can build a nice interface for you and design that interface in the <i>highest contrast</i> possible (bright fonts, black backgrounds)<p>While I was building my NLP product, I went looking for companies that were building smart mirrors and came up empty for ones that were on Google but still in business.

United States],[citation needed] explaining that the words &quot;free white person&quot; in the naturalization act were &quot;synonymous with the word ‘Caucasian’ only as that word is popularly understood,&quot; pointing out that <i>the statutory language was to be interpreted as &quot;words of common speech and not of scientific origin, . . . written in the common speech, for common understanding, by unscientific men.&quot;</i><p>So while it&#x27;s true that biological factors have long been used to assign race, the choice of which factors to use <i>as you yourself say</i> is socially determined. Hence <i>race is socially constructed</i>.<p>There&#x27;s no useful genetic basis for saying there is a &quot;black&quot; race, other than as an expression of a phenotype. The diversity of people with black skin is entirely too large for that characterization to be useful.<p>Stop using definitions of race that were discredited decades ago.",1446003318

He would read the catcher&#x27;s hand signs to the pitcher, indicating the next pitch. They buried a wire from center field to the first base or third base coach, which would vibrate something under his foot signaling the pitch to him, and he would signal the batter.

10462660,comment,10444917,10461464,0,0,dalke,,,"[part 2 - who knew there was a size limit to HN comments?]<p>>  I&#x27;m exactly the opposite of Wikipedia&#x27;s description [of social conservative] (&quot;opposition to abortion, LGBT rights, gender equality&quot;)<p>The Wikipedia page at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism</a> starts:<p>> Social conservatism is a group of political ideologies centred around preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy, in the face of social progressivism. The aims of social conservatism vary from organisation to organisation, and from country to country.<p>That is the definition I was meaning. The one you quoted refers specifically to social conservatism in the United States, which is only a facet of what social conservatism means as a general term.<p>As social conservatism is a rather vague definition, I explained my meaning further as &#x27;believes that the terms you grew up with are somehow the correct terms and should not change&#x27;. This is &#x27;preserving traditional beliefs, attitudes and philosophy&#x27;, yes? And I believe you consider this aspect of social progressivism as politicization of speech, so I still believe I used the term correctly, and compatible with the Wikipedia definition.<p>Quoting again from you:<p>> Was the mainstream media screaming that the term should be used in a certain way, and shaming those who disobeyed?<p>I have no idea of what you&#x27;re talking about. The other term was &quot;gay&quot;, yes? Yes, I believe there was a concerted effort by the LGBTQ movement to use the word &quot;gay&quot; (or &quot;lesbian and gay&quot;) instead of &quot;homosexual&quot;, and that made its way into mainstream media. You can see a reflection of that in Google n-grams: <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gay%2Clesbian%2Chomosexual&year_start=1900&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cgay%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Clesbian%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Chomosexual%3B%2Cc0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=gay%2Clesbian%...</a> . But I don&#x27;t know what &#x27;screaming&#x27; and &#x27;shaming&#x27; has to do with the mainstreaming of the term &#x27;gay&#x27;, and suspect you are alluding to something else entirely.<p>Of the Big 6 that make up mainstream media in the US, I&#x27;m aware of how News Corporation screams and shames people for wanting to use terms (like &quot;marriage&quot;) in new contexts. Is that what you are referring to?<p>> What you call identity I call preferences<p>If you wish to accept it that way, then feel free. Whenever you hear someone say &quot;I identify as a man&quot; then translate it as &quot;I strongly prefer to take on the cultural roles more commonly associated with males.&quot; When you here someone say &quot;I am a Muslim&quot; then translate it as &quot;I strongly prefer to follow Muslim customs&quot;.<p>Be sure to always think of it as a &quot;strong preference&quot;, in roughly the same way that &quot;strong folkways&quot; become &quot;mores&quot; when talking about social norms. It&#x27;s different enough to warrant its own term.<p>> I avoid clothing that would be too much of a statement<p>So like many geeks, part of your identity is to not make a statement through your clothes. This is itself a statement. Others can look at your clothes to infer you might be a geek. Thus your clothing choice helps establish your identity so you don&#x27;t have to explain it to people.<p>> I observe or discover them<p>Remember that <i>everyone else</i> is as disinterested and objective as you are. Just about everyone thinks they&#x27;ve made a rational, objective decision for how to reach their goals.<p>Also note that <i>your choice of goals are part of your identity</i>. Some people born female have the goal of taking on traditionally male gender roles, and they do the best actions they can to achieve those goals.<p>It seem like you understand the basics of identity theory, with the minor proviso that you don&#x27;t like the word &quot;identity&quot;.<p>Now explain this: how do you understand Kennedy&#x27;s &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; speech? Does &quot;civis Romanus sum&quot; make sense to you? When Kennedy said &#x27;Today, I believe, in 1962 the proudest boast is to say, &quot;I am a citizen of the United States.&quot;, do you have no conceptual framework for interpreting it? And when he ended with &quot;Today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is Ich bin ein Berliner!&quot; - do you really not know what it means?<p>These are all phrases of shared identity, but are difficult to explain using your goal-oriented or preference framework.<p>Which echos my complaint earlier that &#x27;your purely descriptive interpretation ... has no predictive power&#x27;.<p>(I noticed that you didn&#x27;t try to interpret the protests that are likely to occur from my evening dress scenario, using your descriptive framework. Is this a tacit admission that descriptive definitions are not appropriate for describing reactions to change?)<p>> In addition to equal rights, feminists also try to abolish social roles.<p>I&#x27;m a feminist. I totally all for social roles. There are teachers, construction workers, programmers, mayors, judges, dancers, greasers, metalheads, members of the KISS army ... see the long list I gave before. While I don&#x27;t want there to be dickheads, my concern as a feminist is that gender and gender preference should not restrict someone from taking on one of these social roles, excepting a handful of cases with a bona fide occupational qualification.<p>Patrick Stewart is a feminist. He also supports social roles like acting, piano playing, and car enthusiast, based on his Wikipedia page.<p>I can&#x27;t even figure out why what you say makes sense. Who thinks there will be only one social role in the grand feminist utopia? Have you perhaps picked on an extremist view that doesn&#x27;t reflect what the vast majority of feminists believe? Or have you only understood what feminism means through the words of its detractors?",1446001792
10462659,comment,10452903,10461183,0,0,scriptman,,,">Actually, the markets created some of the most disease-ridden, sewage-infested hellholes<p>The two most polluted places in the world currently exist in China and Russia and stem from when they were run by Communist dictators ships without markets. So, an absence of markets doesn&#x27;t seem to reduce pollution, it actually seems to increase it.<p>Market&#x27;s aren&#x27;t pefect, far from it, but alternate systems seem to do worse at providing for the things that you specifically care about.<p>> jobs that exploited child labor<p>In agrarian societies, children worked in the fields and still do. This has been since near the beginning of human civilization. It&#x27;s only in advanced, developed countries with mature markets that there are barely any children working.<p>>threw away the sick and injured<p>What evidence do you have for this?<p>>It was people who took up arms, got shot at, but persisted in wrenching some measure of control from the &quot;capitalists&quot; who managed to pass child labor laws, get medical insurance, and 40 hour work weeks.<p>What are you talking about? Who got shot at in advanced developed economies to ensure these laws were passed? The laws were passed through the acts of various parliaments, not through revolution. These changes were made peacefully with in most cases broad agreement across the community. In countries that have experienced violent revolutions, like China and Russia, there are still many children working today, even though they&#x27;ve passed anti child labour laws.<p>You don&#x27;t like the current system, obviously. But any alternate systems that have been tried appear to have done a poorer job on achieving the objectives that you desire. So what alternative do you propose and what evidence do you have that it will do a better job than our current systems?<p>>Your fairy tale narrative is a pleasant fiction, but we have plenty of examples of unfettered capitalism in history--the vast majority of them were horrible.<p>It&#x27;s a shame you don&#x27;t give any examples. I&#x27;m presuming you would be referring to the early industrial revolution. Supposing this is the case, you would be right - at the start of the industrial revolution the working conditions for many people (including children) were poor compared with the standards we enjoy today. Yet, despite this, people still flocked to the cities from the country side to work in factories. Why do you think this is? Do you think that people back then were stupid, or that they hated children? Or do you think they could see for themselves that compared with living on subsistence farms that they were better off? As I said earlier, it is common for children in to work on farms, so they weren&#x27;t any worse off, and the extra income they provided their families made their whole family better off. It&#x27;s easy to apply today&#x27;s morality to people having to deal with conditions hundreds of years ago, it&#x27;s harder to actually live under those conditions and make the best decisions for one&#x27;s family.<p>Also, without going through the early industrial revolution, how do you think we all would have escaped living lives that were poor, nasty, brutish and short?",1446001762
10462658,comment,10444917,10461464,0,0,dalke,,,"What emotion you hear is one of tiredness. Everything I write has been written up in more depth elsewhere. I provided links to some. I don&#x27;t particular want to follow up on a discussion about the lack of a genetic basis for race when the Wikipedia link I gave covers it in detail, but I persevere. As you read from the Wikipedia link:<p>> There is a wide consensus that the racial categories that are common in everyday usage are socially constructed, and that racial groups cannot be biologically defined<p>That quote is followed by several references. The only one which isn&#x27;t to a book is <a href=""http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=2583"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.americananthro.org/ConnectWithAAA/Content.aspx?It...</a> :<p>> &quot;Race&quot; thus evolved as a worldview, a body of prejudgments that distorts our ideas about human differences and group behavior. Racial beliefs constitute myths about the diversity in the human species and about the abilities and behavior of people homogenized into &quot;racial&quot; categories. The myths fused behavior and physical features together in the public mind, impeding our comprehension of both biological variations and cultural behavior, implying that both are genetically determined. Racial myths bear no relationship to the reality of human capabilities or behavior. Scientists today find that reliance on such folk beliefs about human differences in research has led to countless errors.<p>Yes, I believe you are making an error by assuming that &quot;race&quot; is meaningful in this discussion. (We are not talking about forensic anthropology, which is one of the few contexts where it has some meaning.)<p>Most emphatically, &quot;black&quot; is not a meaningful racial category. Black skin is only one of many phenotypes that could be used to split up people into groups. Why not blood type (which is a discrimination issue in Japan)? Ear shape? Lactase persistence?<p>What you call &#x27;breeds&#x27; for dogs would correspond more to the ethnic Icelanders or the Ashkenazi Jews, who are often studied because of their relatively isolated genetic heritage. It does not correspond to race.<p>At this this point it&#x27;s up to you to demonstrate - with reference to recent peer-reviewed literature and not imagery from decades old text books or pop culture magazines - that there is a useful genetic definition behind race. I&#x27;ve provided plenty of evidence to back my position. It seems to me that all you have is your belief that you are right.<p>Quoting now from you:<p>> I never had the need to explain myself<p>That is not strong counter-evidence. A nun, wearing a habit, does not need to explain to people that she is a member of a religious order. A beggar on the street doesn&#x27;t have to explain the role of a beggar. If you fit into your cultural role, and especially if it is a culturally acceptable role, then there&#x27;s little need to explain yourself.<p>Do note that I wrote &quot;well known, large, and easily recognized subculture&quot;. You somehow interpreted that to exclude minority groups. It does not. A minority group, like blacks in the US, can still meet my qualifiers. An example of a minority group which does not is the Hmong population in the US.<p>> proud to be black<p>I do not believe that you have read the links I gave, which explain why it is incorrect to interpret this as &#x27;I am proud to have black skin&#x27;; though the links were about LGBT and not black skin, the principle is the same. I shall quote from the second of those links:<p>> LGBT pride does not mean being proud of having been born lesbian, gay, bisexual, or trans.<p>> It means being proud of having survived.<p>> It means being proud of living in a homophobic, biphobic, transphobic society — a society that commonly treats us with contempt at best and violent hatred at worst — and still getting on with our lives. It means being proud of flourishing, in a society that commonly thinks we’re broken.<p>Again, the emotion you hear from me is the tired frustration of tracking down and linking to relevant resources, only to conclude that it&#x27;s going to waste.<p>You write:<p>> pretentious&quot; to mean &quot;trying to impress by pretending&quot;, which is pretty much the dictionary definition that has nothing to do with identity<p>Here are some examples to show that they are more often coupled than I would expect if &quot;pretentious&quot; had nothing to do with identity:<p>&quot;Self and Pretence: Playing with Identity&quot; - <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008.00443.x/abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9833.2008....</a><p>&quot;A person who assumes a false identity makes a false pretence to which this section applies ...&quot; - <a href=""http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262/s144b.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/sa/consol_act/clca1935262...</a><p>&quot;The story humorously illustrates the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or &quot;Wangero&quot; as she prefers to be called, who scorns her immediate roots in favor of a pretentious &quot;native African&quot; identity.&quot; - <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_Use"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everyday_Use</a><p>&quot;This is because saying ‘pretentious’ is a way of sharpening the borders of your identity, and most people can recognise this instantly. Calling someone pretentious is most commonly code for “this person cares more about appearances and trends than I do”. Because the other person is never really the true focus of the comment, though, it’s more important message is “I care about appearances and trends the correct amount”. ... People who say &#x27;pretentious’ a lot, though, have fallen for a trick: they think that the best way to shore up your own identity is by bringing down people who identify differently. &quot; - <a href=""http://becausegoodbye.tumblr.com/post/42707760044/on-the-word-pretentious"" rel=""nofollow"">http://becausegoodbye.tumblr.com/post/42707760044/on-the-wor...</a><p>You&#x27;ll notice the last one is making my exact point, and much better than I did. You should read that link.<p>A dictionary defines words, but only rarely gives usage hints. For example, consider the words &#x27;graveyard&#x27; and &#x27;cemetery&#x27;. Both mean the same thing. But in the mid-1900s England, the former was more likely to be used by someone in the upper class. This was part of the &quot;U and non-U&quot; discussion on social dialects, see <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_and_non-U_English"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U_and_non-U_English</a> . General purpose dictionaries are not going to record that distinction, just like a general purpose dictionary won&#x27;t go into the deeper conceptual nuances of how &#x27;pretentious&#x27; is used. That&#x27;s not the point of most dictionaries.<p>You therefore cannot use a lack of a specific dictionary definition as negative evidence for a connection.",1446001723

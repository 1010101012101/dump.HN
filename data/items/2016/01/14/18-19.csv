There&#x27;s a third option: start a &quot;lifestyle&quot; business that can eventually be semi-passive. I am currently making about $400k / year working about 5 hours / week from a few different &quot;lifestyle&quot; businesses which I&#x27;ve built slowly over the past 5 years.<p>There&#x27;s no question that joining a startup as an employee is a terrible idea for any competent engineer. By far the best way to make money in startups is to be a founder. In every business I&#x27;ve started, I&#x27;ve always had big exit dreams, but when those fail to materialize, my startups have soft landed into passive &quot;lifestyle&quot; businesses of which I collect 90% of the profit. Mere employees are forced to quit in this situation and are left with nothing - this is why being a founder is so important. Also, never take VC money without a very good reason to do so.",1452797963

But it is per file system, not per directory. though per-user limits seem to be supported too.<p>But even if a per-directory limit could be enforced, how would you get around the fact that the program could create files in other dirs than the controlled ones, under your overall home dir (as long as they had write permission)?

Often a dedicated RTK transmitter is installed on the farm for the tractor to pick up and use to correct against the GPS you may be already familiar with like the one in your car or smartphone.<p>End of Row Guidance:  A piece of software that allows you to program macros to control an orchestrated set of events for the implement you&#x27;re pulling behind you.  (seeder, bailer, combine).  There are many repeatable events that happen when farming from lowering & raising seeders, dealing with drift, changing seeding depth based on previously collected yield data, etc...<p>Mesh Networks:  So one guy can drive a tractor and a combine with the combine following next to the tractor.<p>Auto Guidance:  Think self driving car.  Functional safety is a huge problem for companies producing self driving tractors - see ISO26262<p>ISOBUS: Is a technology whereby an implement is attached to a tractor and the tractor&#x27;s cabin display creates a GUI image and/or menu for that implement to control it.  The display need not have any advanced knowledge of the implement.  So even the implements have an on board computer too.<p>It really irks me to see comments like yours.

I was curious why you think that content is heading that way?<p>If anything, I&#x27;d argue that globalizing Netflix combined with stronger control over their own original content enables Netflix to move towards an endgame where lots of niche audiences are served (rather than only mass markets). At CES, Ted Sarandos (VP of Content) mentioned that traditional TV had to hit home runs all the time, while Netflix can score with singles, double, etc. Why would Netflix jeopardize this advantage and hop in the time machine to become an outdated TV company?<p>It sucks that House of Cards and some of the older original content (particularly the more popular titles) aren&#x27;t globally available, yet, but I believe (also from the CES talk), this was done because Netflix couldn&#x27;t afford the financial risk at the time (and/or simply could not afford the global rights) for some of these shows. More recent/upcoming shows are licensed globally, so there&#x27;s an apparent effort to ensure that Netflix moves to having a single global catalog.

There are all kinds of technology in these things as well as on the farm itself in the form of GPS correction (called RTK) to deal with auto guidance and improving GPS accuracy.  We are also building mesh networks so a tractor and a combine can be driven by one person & having the combine follow the tractor in side-by-side fashion.  I work on over the air software updates, some of the touch screens are essentially custom computers running Android.  We have a number of on board modules handling steering and precision farming as it&#x27;s called in the industry.  All these modules are interconnected with a mix of technology (CAN, TCP/IP over Broad-R-Reach, LIN, WiFi, and GPS).  Check out ISOBUS too... ISOBUS is a technology where any tractor can be connected to any tow behind implement, including 3rd party, and that implement&#x27;s GUI is shown on a touch panel for the operator to control and program.

10903358,comment,10886253,10901088,0,0,Manishearth,,,"Yes. And this problem is isomorphic to the problem where you have a freestanding function; i.e.<p>struct Foo {..}<p>impl Foo {\n fn handle(&mut self, req: &mut Request) {..}\n}<p>is isomorphic to<p>struct Foo {..}<p>fn handle(foo: &mut Foo, req: &mut Request) {..}<p>And of course it is. The handle function needs a `Foo` to store state or whatever. If it didn&#x27;t, you wouldn&#x27;t have implemented it as a method at all, you would have implemented it as a non-self function (`impl Foo {fn handle(req: &mut Request)}`, which can also be passed directly as `Foo::handle`). Where would the Iron function get this receiver from? You have to pass the receiver down with the function, so you need a closure (anything which is callable and has an associated state, i.e. more than just a function pointer)<p>This has nothing to do with `self`. It has to do with the fact that <i>methods</i> need a <i>receiver</i>, which is a general fact of life with methods.<p>So your handler needs a receiver with some extra state that you&#x27;re using. You would need to pass down the receiver regardless, and the signature doesn&#x27;t support arbitrary receivers.<p>This is a problem in Rust and Python, as you correctly noted. It&#x27;s a worse problem in Java where the stdlib callable doesn&#x27;t even allow arguments, so you have to implement an interface (FWIW this solution is available to you in Rust too, either directly implementing `Fn(..)` or if Iron decides to accept a special trait instead), which is much more typing. PHP needs you to construct an array thing to make a callable closure, which is arguably just as &#x27;bad&#x27; as Java.<p>C# has type safe callbacks which allow you to specify arguments, however methods don&#x27;t work. You need additional boilerplate for it (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015451/pass-a-method-as-a-parameter"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4015451/pass-a-method-as-...</a>)<p>C++ has function pointers, but methods don&#x27;t work as function pointers (since you still need there to be a closure under the hood, and C++ doesn&#x27;t do that kind of implicit stuff). C++ Concepts seems to have a &quot;Callable&quot; concept, but I didn&#x27;t look into whether or not it comes with auto-closureifying syntax.<p>So really the issue has nothing to do with `self` being used for method signatures, it has to do with whether or not `object.method` is automatically turned into a closure. Rust tries to avoid such magic, so it doesn&#x27;t have this feature. It could, with relative ease, <i>without getting rid of `self`</i>.<p>Two languages which do seem to do this are Javascript and Go. In Go (<a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/jsKtkbD7vr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/jsKtkbD7vr</a>), `foo.handle` is automatically turned into a `func(*Request)`, which is even more magical, since IronRun expected a `func` and not an `interface Callable` or whatever.<p>Javascript does the same, `obj.handle` will auto-create a closure for you.<p>Yes, it would be slightly neater for Rust to auto-closure `obj.handle`, but this sounds a bit too magical for Rust (which tries to be low level and make costs explicit). This has nothing to do with `self`, and this isn&#x27;t a problem localized to Rust.",1452796611

But, I know what I like, and I know working on a Cisco feels like 1996, and that working on a full-blown modern UNIX/Linux system feels like home. And, fast network gear <i>is</i> available for Linux and the BSDs. 10Gb interfaces that work with Linux/BSD are not difficult to find, and 1Gb interfaces (sometimes several of them) have been <i>standard</i> on every server and barebones rackmount on the market for a decade.<p>I understand there are special purpose boxes that do things no off-the-shelf commodity box can do (I don&#x27;t know enough about high end networking to know where to draw that line), but I honestly doubt 95% of business networks need them. And, yet, a huge percentage of business networks that have real routers (rather than little wifi routers from LinkSys/NetGear or whatever) have a Cisco of some sort, even when they don&#x27;t have anyone on staff who knows how to work the thing. I&#x27;ve walked into several businesses that had expertise in house for everything <i>except</i> their router, which is also weird...why pick a Cisco router for your little ~100-1000 node network, if you&#x27;ve got Linux or BSD guys hanging out in the server room every day? They&#x27;d call someone and sit around waiting when their network was acting up.<p>I learned how to use Cisco routers just so I&#x27;d be able to replace them easily (enough knowledge to read the routing tables, firewall rules, etc., but not enough to do much useful), when I found situations like that.",1452796194

That&#x27;s a huge difference!<p>I&#x27;m wondering where my calculations went off. Obviously they&#x27;re paying a premium for the best talents and have the money. Let&#x27;s not discuss money, but rather why engineering is endless.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting case study when you limit it to just apps.<p>A back end might be endless work - it needs to be scaled to handle 1M photos per hour and have 99.99% uptime and so on.<p>Front end has no issues with scale. Whether there&#x27;s 10 users or 1M users that hour, it just handles what the back end gives it. Users won&#x27;t notice most optimizations.

Previously they were fine cutting their own production in order to maintain a particular price because they were certain that eventually ALL of the oil in Saudi Arabia would get sold on the global market. If that took 100 years, that actually was even better for them. If you believed in peak oil, then being the last one standing with reserves actually would be awesome.<p>With clean energy beating projections it looks like we&#x27;re not going to burn every drop of oil in the Earth. Given that, the Saudis are no longer patient. If they hold back their reserves to maintain a particular price it&#x27;s very possible we&#x27;ll get off oil before we run out of oil. Thus the Saudis would have left money on the table if they didn&#x27;t shift strategy.<p>It seems like their new strategy is to extract every dollar they can for their oil reserves.

Is there any way for me to find out what sort of fundraising activity has happened since I&#x27;ve left?<p>Longer version\nI joined the company mid-pivot, after they had just closed a fairly large round of funds, which pushed up the e strike price to very high levels. While there, we burned through a good chunk of that money, and I am aware of 3 other times the company raised cash, albeit not publicly known about (revolving debt via a bank, some high-net-worth-people investment and some &quot;partnerships&quot; that included money).<p>Just before I left the company, there was a stock option repricing that brought the price down ~66%, although I was a bit unclear on the details of it. I still decided not to buy more of my options, even at this new price, due to the aforementioned worries. The reason I bought 1 share is so that I can judge whether I made a mistake or not. I&#x27;m using this as a learning experience, whether I have good judgement for whether a company&#x27;s stock is worth anything. Friends of mine who were at the company years before I joined chose to forfeit their options which were in the $1/share range, and mine were in the $30 range (after the repricing, they were $90+ before), and they&#x27;ll never really know if they left a good chunk of money behind or not. I&#x27;d rather know!<p>However, I&#x27;ve been unable to find out why this repricing happened, or any information about the fund raising activity. I&#x27;ve searched SEC.gov for company filings, but they end back in 2013--my guess is that the JOBS act changed this sort of reporting? Some companies still seem to file documents, but it seems that it&#x27;s no longer required.<p>Summary: Does anyone have experience with tracking former companies&#x27; financial activities and how it pertains to current stock ownership?",1452795411

This has always helped me in becoming a better human being. Once when I was travelling I felt that except for sharing a photo on existing social networks (and adding a caption) or sending it as a message on messaging apps there isn&#x27;t a place online where I can go to specifically inspire my friends to travel to the place where I was. And that&#x27;s when the idea of Uggozi started taking shape. In Uggozi we bring the joyful experience of sending and receiving picture postcards to mobile. To create a postcard one can upload a photo or select an existing gorgeous photo of a place, add an inspirational quote to its back and send it to friends.<p>It&#x27;s been often said that we&#x27;re &#x27;born too late to explore earth, born too early to explore space&#x27; but what if we could rekindle our innate desire to be explorers. At Uggozi we hope to do just that. One can become the &#x27;Uggozi explorer&#x27; of a geographical location by taking the first popular photo from anywhere in that geographical location.<p>Uggozi derives its name from the isiZulu word ugq!ozi which means collective inspiration and aptly defines our mission of making a community where travellers, explorers and dreamers can collectively inspire each other to explore this beautiful planet. In the first step of this journey we are focused on making it the most visually appealing and inspiring place to be at when you get those wanderlust pangs :)<p>We moderate the photos uploaded so that their subject is the place they have been marked with and not an individual. The photos should somehow define the place, it&#x27;s culture or people. And also to deliver the best experience on a device, Uggozi shows only the photos that will look good on that specific device.",1452795340

By the time these increased costs reach individuals the effect is negligible but it does affect the broader (Malaysian) economy. The second is through insurance companies increasing charges across the board. Insurance is a marketplace just like any other and in order to stay competitive in one market costs can be spread to another. The final is direct regulatory intervention where the wider customer base is directly charged a percentage (google &quot;insurance levies&quot;).<p>So I opened with &quot;I don&#x27;t know what the story is in Malaysia but ..&quot; because the relative influence of each of these factors is profoundly regional, related to regulatory and government policy .

Jokes on them though: That oil is always going to be profitable around $50-60/barrel. Once the Sauds lower production to raise the price of oil back up, frackers will fire right back up. It&#x27;ll take 12-18 months, but it&#x27;ll still happen. Almost no one burns petroleum for electricity mind you (nat gas, yes, but not oil) except Hawaii and parts of Alaska, and they&#x27;re moving as fast as possible to renewables because of price spikes that occur occasionally.<p>So you&#x27;re going to see this seesaw effect. Oil shoots up, more oil comes onto the market, oil goes back down, etc.<p>Renewables. Oh how I love me some renewables. There&#x27;s this legislation, the production tax credit [1]. It generously subsidizes the installation of renewables in the US. There&#x27;s always been this quagmire though, as Congress would only extend it 1 year at a time (hard to plan capital expenditures worth billions when the legislation you&#x27;re relying on is always up in the air).<p>But things changed in December of last year. At the end of 2015, in a landmark deal, Congress extended it for <i>5 years</i>, and in return, the US lifted export restrictions on crude oil. That means that solar and wind is going to roll out faster than ever. Natural gas will push out the remaining 30% of coal fired generation in the US, and wind and solar will fill the gaps (this is good; natural gas is cleaner, and produces much less CO2 per MWH produced). As more wind and solar comes online, along with utility scale battery storage, we&#x27;ll reduce our reliance on natural gas (protip: don&#x27;t invest long-term in generators who own substantial nat gas generation assets).<p>China is deploying wind at an astonishing rate, faster than even nuclear [2]. They&#x27;re heavily subsidizing electric vehicles now as well [3]. The price of coal is plummeting (which is good!) [4]. The best case scenario is whatever is left of it is left in the ground.<p>If you can afford it, elect to get renewables from your utility. The premium should be ~1-3 cents/kwh. If you can afford to get an electric car, and it makes sense for your lifestyle, do so. If it doesn&#x27;t, use a carshare program.<p>Collective effort can change the status quo.<p>[1] <a href=""http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-tax-credit-ptc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/savings/renewable-electricity-production-t...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2015/highlights50"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2015/highlights5...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-consumers-bought-nearly-300-more-electric-cars-year-compared-2014-2222591"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/chinese-consumers-bought-nearly-300-m...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.quandl.com/collections/markets/coal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.quandl.com/collections/markets/coal</a>",1452794908

Studies like this only reinforce the already existing negative stereotypes about &quot;nerds in tech&quot;, in both sexes.<p>You claim this is a problem. Here&#x27;s a simple solution: Make tech companies segregated by gender. What about that? The thing is, I presume, people who did the study don&#x27;t want to solve a problem of &quot;unwanted sex advances&quot; in the workplace. They want to solve a problem of not enough women in tech. And this is not the way to go about it.<p>It is also an interesting question, and I am genuinely curious. I also doubt women actually choose the career based on amount of unwanted sexual advances, and having the numbers could finally put that stupid theory to rest (if it&#x27;s false, of course, maybe it&#x27;s not, I dunno; but based on the above provided link, it probably is false).",1452794614

Using separate key pairs without an agent doesn&#x27;t prevent key theft due to memory disclosure vulnerabilities like this one; it merely compartmentalizes the damage.  But if you use an agent, the client never loads the private key, so it&#x27;s safe from memory disclosure vulnerabilities.  Stealing a private key would require filesystem access or remote code execution, at which point <i>all</i> of your private keys are at risk, so you might as well just use a single private key per device.<p>For the best security, store your private key on a smartcard, so even an attacker with filesystem access or remote code execution can&#x27;t steal it.",1452794470

Being able to get into a meditative state quickly can make or break your performance. Take to long, and you don't reach the state, and are more prone to errors. Almost all of the high level gymnasts visualize every routine they do, with varying degrees of success.<p>As you pointed out, Jason's goal does only average at about 5 minutes a day. But that's more time than a gymnast usually has (unless he wants to dismiss his teammate's routines, which is not exactly... nice).

The optimization is going to be based on a search engine algorithm, and with Google being the most common search engine that's the one most people are going to optimize for.<p>That was my point: if you're trying to compete in search and analytics, it's not in a vacuum; it's in the context of a specific company's search algorithm.

The difference between them is the convention of how this is used.<p>cons lisp assumes pairs are typically head, rest, and so the natural form of most functions is linear recursion: an expression involving some function of head and a single recursive call on rest with a base case handling the empty list.<p>conc lisp instead assumes pairs are typically left, right and so the natural form of most functions is binary recursion: an expression that is a function of recursive calls on both left and right with a similar base case.<p>Which prompts some thoughts: are there optimizations similar to constant space tail calls for binary recursion? What about n-way recursion? What would a lisp built of n-tuples (perhaps cache line sized) look like?",1295580485

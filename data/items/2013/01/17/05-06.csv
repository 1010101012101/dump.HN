Yes, it involved that too, but it also involved taking materials that others had copyright to and threatening to make them publicly available, which could have disrupted many organizations' functioning.<p>Would you be surprised if someone pulled four million videos off of YouTube (or books off of Google Books) and torrented them, and then was prosecuted and asked to serve six months?",1358402388

A hacker or an entrepreneur is someone who breaks rules to create something. Innovation and consensus are antonyms, not synonyms. Innovation does not happen by committee. If you wait for a ""democratic process"" that is bought and rigged by the copyright maximalists, you will wait forever. The bold actions of individuals are the only way anything has ever changed for the better.<p>As for the fetishization of ""democracy"" in Kerr's post, sometimes elections produce good outcomes. But often the wisdom of crowds isn't so wise; I'd hate to have the value of the gravitational constant or the next CEO of Google determined by public plebiscite. And many times, perhaps most times, the crowd votes after someone bold has already moved and shown the way. That's what Swartz was doing. What is legal and what is moral are not the same thing, and all those who argue ""it's bad, but it was the law"" are the moral inverses of Swartz: ""it's good even if it's not the law"".",1358402105

The product is fundamentally flawed.<p>3) Cross-promote. You need to somehow get a friendly slightly bigger player to put a link in their game to your game, and visa versa.

5071232,comment,5067709,5067709,4,0,chipsy,,,"Like others, I would have to point to the choice of making another sudoku as a critical flaw. When a game is the same game as every other, it gets very little buzz or word of mouth...unless it has some overwhelmingly strong new feature to add value.<p>Content items like art, storytelling, quantity of levels and pre-scripted events are mostly reflective of how video game development budgets tend to be proportioned against marketing budgets, where as the marketing budget gets bigger, more money is spent on making a lavish production that slightly outclasses the competition. These things help when a game has an existing audience that needs to mature into a more elaborate experience, but they have strongly diminishing returns on investment.<p>Software features like multi-player, solvers, hints and tutorials, puzzle generators, are all good incremental extensions that can get people's attention, and many of these features are relatively cheap compared to additional content.  Unfortunately, all of the big, obvious features for incrementally extending sudoku have been covered - there's no chance of gaining a lot of new users in this market when it's so thoroughly saturated.<p>Monetization has also been saturated. Game monetization follows a pattern typical to  innovative technology: Innovators can go pay-to-play if they're selling the privilege of a new experience. A good number of niche games can slip under the radar, making good profits for the innovator, but not enough to get attention. If the game is so profitable that it attracts a lot of attention, clones will appear and add incremental improvements, which pressures both price and quality. Eventually price collapses as free-to-play versions appear. However, free-to-play is _not_ the last step - open-source is. When people are hacking together polished, open-source versions of the game design, it's usually well past profitability, and sudoku is definitely in this category. (Exceptions to open-source as the last step exist, but are mostly related to the relative costs of content vs. technology)<p>Which leaves you with ""create a new, sudoku-inspired game design."" Game design is the underlying source of both profitability and popularity in the videogaming sector, but it means having design skills in addition to production skills - formulaic processes for making original, marketable designs don't exist. The vast majority of people in the sector understand either original(but unmarketable) or marketable(but unoriginal), but have trouble recognizing when a design decision and a marketing decision are related, and what the implications are. And since maximizing marketability is more likely to keep you in business, industry consensus always biases around it.",1358401923

5071196,comment,5070956,5071150,3,0,downandout,,,">plea offers are not binding on the court and are presented as optional suggestions for the judge to consider during sentencing<p>That's not entirely true.  There are two basic types of pleas.  One is a sentence recommendation - the government recommends a sentence, but the court is free to do what it wants and the defendant cannot withdraw the plea if they are unhappy with the sentence.  However, rule 11(c)(1)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure  allows for plea agreements under which the court may only either accept or reject the plea and the stipulated sentence; it cannot change the sentence.  If the court rejects a plea made under this rule, the defendant is free to withdraw their plea and go back to square one (face a trial).  The Rule that the plea is being made under is always specified in the plea agreement in writing.  I don't know which type they were discussing, but he would have had to be insane to plead guilty to 13 felonies and not insist on an 11(c)(1)(C) plea.<p>He may have been stressed not over the initial sentence, but over the the consequences.  For one thing, he would have been under federal Supervised Release for a period of either 3 or 5 years, during which a judge could have barred him from using a computer or the Internet.  Any violation of these rules could have then yielded an instant sentence of up to the length of supervision - either 3 or 5 years - even if the violation occurred on the last day of his supervision.  These types of restrictions are put in place all the time.<p>Finally, pleading guilty to 13 felonies may have been problematic from a criminal history point of view.  If he were ever charged with anything in the future, the judge or prosecutor would be unlikely to show mercy on someone that has 13 felonies on their record.  In some states, any prosecution for a felony subsequent to this deal would have qualified him for a three strikes/habitual offender status and an accompanying life sentence (Nevada being one, for example, that does not distinguish between violent and non-violent felonies for purposes of three strikes sentences - a felony DUI in Vegas after this plea would have earned Aaron a life sentence).",1358401313

Many small journals depend on subscription fees from services like JSTOR.<p>But look, I'm not saying the law is perfect. There are whole encyclopedias written on legal theory about people's responsibilities to follow arguable but imperfect laws, and that is a big debate. The essence of the case here is that a ""long ranger"" activist who acts to publicize a massive database does threaten a significant financial disruption to many parties, and that is ""harm"" even under JS Mill's ""harm principle."" It's not like possessing drugs (which of course people go to harder jails for 20 years for possessing).<p>If I am recalling correctly, a key point in the government's case was that Aaron was going to distribute the documents to the world had he succeeded. If so, they would have had to prove that beyond a reasonable doubt. If Aaron had a good case that he was just downloading the documents for his own personally curiosity, he would probably have won, and it would be easier to say the prosecution was overblown.<p>But all that seems to have happened here is that the government offered 6 low-security months to someone who the government believed it could prove, beyond any reasonable doubt, was intending to undermine the revenue model of a significant part of the world's academic infrastructure.

In fact, I should further point out that it is not merely the use of such technologies but rather the perfection of these technologies that allowed Apple to use them and create a user experience that would amaze the world, followed by developers using the perfected technologies to create even more delightful experiences.<p>Now, going back to the Title of the article that caught my eye in the fist place, while it is realistic for people to expect enhancements of hardware, new design, new software, etc. from Apple, it is unrealistic to expect Apple to release revolutionary products every year, simply because the core technologies don't follow a 1-year introduction cycle.

Instead, complain that this is business as usual in federal criminal cases around the country  mostly with defendants who no one has ever heard of and who get locked up for years without anyone else much caring.<p>On the fourth issue, yes, the Swartz case does point to a serious problem with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

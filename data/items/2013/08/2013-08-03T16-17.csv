One of the simplest and most robust way of doing parallellization of a system like DF avoids all such issues in a very simple way with no almost no synchronization needed.<p>Basically, when starting the game, spawn X threads and partition the world between them so that only one thread can write to any particular world block. Then, when calculating a new frame, make a read-only copy of the previous world frame. Any reads are done from that copy; any writes obviously occur only in the blocks assigned to a particular thread. Wait for all threads to complete, then render thread. No messaging, locking, event handling or whatever needed. Just care and forethought.<p>But you are right that Toady likely not possessing that kind of knowledge. That&#x27;s the very reason why people would like to see others involved for things like optimization and UI design and the main point these people are trying to make; Toady seems either not able or willing to do it himself, and it could improve the state of the game tremendously.",1375549151

In Russia, time on the computer was measured in minutes, he says. When you write a program, you are given a tiny time slot to make it work. Consequently we learned to write the code in a way that minimized the amount of debugging. And so you had to think about it a lot before you committed it to paper. . . . The ready availability of computer time creates this mode of working where you just have an idea and type it and maybe erase it 10 times.

Do-It-Yourself Cellular IDS
&quot;For less than $500, you can build your own cellular intrusion detection system to detect malicious activity through your own local femtocell. Our team will show how we leveraged root access on a femtocell, reverse engineered the activation process, and turned it into a proof-of-concept cellular network intrusion monitoring system.<p>We leveraged commercial Home Node-Bs (&quot;&quot;femtocells&quot;&quot;) to create a 3G cellular network sniffer without needing to reimplement the UMTS or CDMA2000 protocol stacks. Inside a Faraday cage, we connected smartphones to modified femtocells running Linux distributions and redirected traffic to a Snort instance. Then we captured traffic from infected phones and showed how Snort was able to detect and alert upon malicious traffic. We also wrote our own CDMA protocol dissector in order to better analyze CDMA traffic.&quot;",1375547024

6152466,comment,6151748,6151932,3,0,btilly,,,"Natural gas is often cited as a bridge to more renewable energy.<p>The thing about renewable energy like wind and solar is that it has sudden variability.  To satisfy your needs with it, you need some other form of energy that can be ramped up and down just as quickly as a counterbalance.  The obvious candidate would be batteries, but we do not have battery systems large enough to supply the grid for minutes at a time.  (People are working on this.  But we do not currently have it.)<p>This is where natural gas comes in.  It produces lots of energy.  And you can ramp energy production up and down very efficiently, almost instantaneously.<p>By contrast compare something like nuclear power.  A nuclear power plant is basically a huge steam engine with the water heated by radioactivity.  To start generating power you bring the water to a boil.  To stop you let it cool down.  But big tanks of water do not heat up or slow down fast - you need hours.  Thus you can supply a grid from nuclear, but you can&#x27;t counterbalance nuclear and renewables.<p>Therefore the common vision is that we move from a largely coal base to a mixed natural gas/renewable base, and then to a renewable/battery base.  So natural gas is seen as a bridge to an all renewable future.",1375546312

It seems the product is aimed at technical users (at least initially), though there are some technical details I didn&#x27;t see in the video, description or FAQ:<p>- This is an MUA, correct?  Based on the features on the project page, it sounds like MailPile will not act as an MTA or MDA, and is predominantly interfacing with mbox/maildir.  I see features for IMAP and POP3 on the roadmap, but its not clear if using those protocols is idiomatic for MailPile.<p>- How is PGP/GPG handled?  The server-side code for MailPile must have access to my secret key, correct?  Is MailPile&#x27;s web interface then accessible via HTTPS (given the proper cert)?<p>- Is there a plan for a key management interface?<p>- It sounds like the MUA itself (MailPile) is a server, and it would access maildir/mbox directly.  Is there any API planned for accessing that data through MailPile&#x27;s programatically, or is MailPile&#x27;s main goal to provide a browser interface?<p>- This might have been covered, but will the web interface support mobile as well?<p>Thanks for working on this...it really sounds like a great project!",1375545653

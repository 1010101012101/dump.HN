Static linking and dead code elimination is a problem we solved in the 1970s for compiled languages. Has the time come to adopt a proper linker for the web?<p>Google&#x27;s Closure Compiler has supported dead code elimination [1] since 2009, but the feature imposes some unpalatable restrictions. It never supported popular libraries like jQuery. The process is also rather slow, as Closure Compiler must analyze all code in the bundle at once.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilation_levels#advanced_optimizations"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/compilat...</a>",1454479029

What Patek and the like might be worried about is people moving from Patek to Apple.<p>But when you start to think more carefully about that scenario, it&#x27;s rather ridiculous. People into watches don&#x27;t just buy one. You don&#x27;t &quot;switch&quot; brands, you just select a different one for your next purchase. It could be another Patek, perhaps an Audemars Piguet, or even an Apple Watch.<p>The idea that someone buying these watches would sell them all and buy an Apple Watch, never to own another high-end watch again, is simply absurd.",1454478932

11024869,comment,11017587,11021295,0,0,EvanPlaice,,,"From a library developer perspective, the major issue I find with NPM is that it stores it&#x27;s own copy of the source.<p>Old but useful libraries will often stagnate and get forked by users who still want/need to carry on development. Linking directly to a repo would make more sense but that&#x27;s not how most people use NPM.<p>> In terms of knowing what&#x27;s cutting-edge practice it seems you have to watch Twitter a lot and be careful not to follow every single bad idea.<p>A lot of this stems from the fact that todays solutions will likely become tomorrow&#x27;s technical debt. It&#x27;s not a popular opinion on HN but adjusting development to follow current/future web standards is insurance against future technical debt.<p>Webpack, for instance solves todays problems:<p>Modules:<p>Currently, there are 3 non-standards (AMD, UMD, CommonJS). To make 3rd party libs interoperable, all 3 standards have to be supported so Webpack handles the messy details. Which BTW is a huge improvement over not being able to use libs that don&#x27;t support whatever non-standard you choose. As for future standards, Webpack is moving in a very positive direction by adding ES6 module support in v2.<p>Transpiling:<p>Transpiling as it&#x27;s used today will likely become less relevant over time. In terms of Javascript, ES6 provides useful additions to make programming in vanilla JS much nicer. ES7 has the potential to shake things up even more in a really good way. For instance, decorators will make it much simpler and more straightforward to create higher order functions; which in turn will make it much easier to do functional-style programming in JS.<p>The next major shift will come with CSS extensions. Less, SASS, Stylus are the current common non-standard solutions to the difficulty of managing large CSS codebases. I&#x27;d expect that the web standards people will eventually cherry-pick the good parts from them the way they adopted the good parts of CoffeeScript in ES6. Unfortunately, those who heavily rely on Less, SASS and Stylus will either have to adapt or continue to use/support the tools of a dying standard when everybody else moves on.<p>Bundling:<p>Bundling as we know it today is an anti-pattern but also a necessary evil due to the limitations of HTTPv1. Warming intermediate caches helps but a warm local cache trumps all.  Unfortunately, bundling is in such widespread use the chances of a user having a warm cache are essentially nil.<p>HTTPv2 will (hopefully) move influence developers to abandon bundling strategies, thereby improving cache reliability for all.<p>The next major shift we need to improve cache reliability is a widely-adopted versioning strategy that library devs use to mark packages for long-term support. It&#x27;s insane that everybody relies on bleeding version of dependencies but everybody bundles everything so there&#x27;s no measurable benefit to sticking with an older, more stable version of a dependency.<p>I would touch on the issues with the widespread adoption of functional-specific supersets of JS but -- considering the tastes of many HN users -- I really don&#x27;t feel like being downvoted into oblivion.<p>> Does anybody know a quick way of making the right decision?<p>Try to see things from a long-term perspective. Stay cognizant of the nature of the hype cycle.<p>Some technologies really do have the potential to provide huge improvements in performance and usability. Some will eventually provide the improvements they promise but the first version won&#x27;t be good enough.<p>Most tools -- no matter how useful they appear to be today -- will likely die or be replaced by something better in the future.",1454477212

It was in high school... and I mean during school hours my junior year. It was 1988. Yes, stupid and irresponsible I know but it was a great experience.<p>I only took 1/3 of a tab... a friend had it and we split the tab between three of us. Coincidentally there was a field trip that day for Jr&#x27;s and Sr&#x27;s and I had not turned in my permission slip and so didn&#x27;t get to go. I suppose that&#x27;s how I justified taking LSD in school to myself. Everyone else was already gone on a trip so....<p>The friend who had the LSD was a &quot;bad kid&quot; and was in in school suspension so he went to sit under out of class supervision all day. The other friend got on the bus and went off on the field trip. I went to mostly empty classes.<p>I had guitar class that semester. The class was mostly freshmen and sophomores with shag hair aspiring to be the next Metallicas and Iron Maidens. They were a pretty wild group. I on the other hand was outwardly at least pretty studious and responsible and respectful of authority.<p>The class had a sub teacher that day because the regular teacher was chaperoning the field trip. So there wasn&#x27;t a real lesson... just a bunch of amateur Bevis and Butthead antics while the sub teacher read a magazine and I sat in the back watching the whole thing with a godlike sense of enlightenment. At one point one of the kids wadded up a paper and threw at the sub hitting her in the head. I didn&#x27;t see who it was but did see the paper hit her. So she flips out and starts yelling. And I&#x27;m trying not to burst out laughing. Not because she got hit by a paper, but because of the utter ridiculousness of the whole situation. Here we all were, on a little ball of mud in infinite time and space and we don&#x27;t have anything better to do but sit in a room wasting limited time and acting up and throwing papers and get upset when we get hit by a papers. And that&#x27;s what life in society was... silly monkeys acting out because they didn&#x27;t understand the deeper implications of existence. And now I knew how trivial it all was and it was entertaining to watch.<p>So the sub gets really mad and calls in the assistant principal. He come in and says &quot;OK, who threw the paper?&quot;. No one speaks up. I&#x27;m just grinning away in the back at the petty foolishness of the whole thing. He sees me and singles me out.<p>(principal)\n- &quot;Who threw the paper?&quot;<p>(me)\n-&quot;I didn&#x27;t see who threw the paper&quot;<p>(principal)\n-&quot;Ok... if you don&#x27;t tell me who threw the paper you will get detention&quot;<p>(me)\n&quot;If you have come to a place in your existence that it is your destiny to give me detention, than I will take the detention, but I did not see who threw the paper&quot;.<p>At this the assistant principal stops and does a double take. He pauses for like 30 seconds completely confused and bewildered (and briefly wondering about his destiny). But he can&#x27;t back down so he gives me three days detention. So I tell him &quot;I accept that this is who you are and this is what you feel you must do, but it does not in any way affect who I really am&quot;. At this he does another double take, gawks for a bit and then leaves the room.<p>Later he comes up to me at lunch and apologies for his anger and rescinds the detention. And he is looking at me like I&#x27;m some kind of strange wizard or something. I just smile and say ok, fine and keep eating my lunch.<p>I never looked at the social/organizational aspects of school the same again. I also never took LSD in school again. I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s now and even though I did have other experiences later I haven&#x27;t for nearly two decades and wouldn&#x27;t take LSD at this point. I&#x27;m not against it.. I just wouldn&#x27;t take it. I don&#x27;t think I need to. I have gotten out of it what I think I can... some useful, some maybe not so useful and honestly I have zero interest in exploring it any further. Sorry for the long post. I think the original point is that sometimes being in a normal situation under the influence of LSD can give you a whole new perspective that is actually more truthful. It breaks the layer the mind puts on reality and you have no choice but to see a more objective view of the situation. It&#x27;s certainly not reliable though and a lot of confusion results sometimes in people thinking things that aren&#x27;t really so. And sometimes you mind needs to put a layer over reality for you to function. Just my opinions.",1454476957

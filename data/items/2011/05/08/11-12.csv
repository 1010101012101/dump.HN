It's part of the IEEE 754 floating point specification.<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IEEE_754"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/IEEE_754</a><p>Look, a big ""system language"" like Java also defines NaN, +inf, -inf as values of double (see Field Summary).<p><a href=""http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Double.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/Doubl...</a><p>As in<p>double mathError = Double.NaN;<p>Any other standards conformant language supports NaN for floating point numerical values. I would even argue an absence of NaN should be perceived as a language flaw.<p>EDIT: I realize the above might not actually be sufficiently explanatory. ""Not a number"" is used to specify the class of numbers that cannot be represented in floating point notation. This includes the undefined like 0 / 0 and imaginary numbers (e.g. square root of a negative value). It can also be used for missing values in a large computation.<p>Any operator with a NaN results in a NaN. So 1 + NaN = NaN. Most NaNs are quiet, as in they do not throw an exception and allow the operation to continue. This allows large batch computations to continue without stopping the entire process for one bad record. Instead there will be a NaN for that record and the rest of the data will be processed correctly. You can see why this might be useful when dealing with large amounts of scientific data and hopefully why the IEEE would introduce such a feature.",1304855790

2525715,comment,2525646,2525646,13,0,maxklein,,,"This article is proof that there is something wrong in the system. The article mirrors those ""an era of never ending growth"" posted by Jon Katz et al during the first boom.<p>The first boom was a game of financial geeks. The boom was a way for smart people who are into financials to move money from one set of hands into their own hands. The computer nerds got played by financial nerds - value was not really destroyed, it just relocated into the pockets of a few saavy guys.<p>There are signs that the same thing is happening again, but this time on a different scale. Certain big time investors make their money from playing mathematical games on the financial market. They are betting low and selling high. Those same investors have seen another opportunity to do such trades, but betting on these so called 'startups'. There is a certain category of financial wizard - once you see them jumping into an industry, it means that the mathematics has gotten complicated enough that they can use their knowledge advantage to move money from one set of hands into the other.<p>The rumours of a boom are not unfounded. There is a financial game being played, but it's not a penny game like the first one, this time it's a premium game. They are avoiding the mass of last time and moving bigger chunks of money around.<p>People are going to lose money, but I don't think those people willl be Joe Ordinary this time. I think it's going to be a bunch of medium-wealthy people, who will buy into the claims of extra-ordinary returns.<p>In the end, the same thing will happen - the cycle of money being pushed around and part of it going to the people in charge of the system is going to stop, and once more people will lose money.<p>However, I doubt the outcry will be particularly large this time, because there will be less people affected, even if the sums could be similar.<p>Where there is a lot of money moving around, there are people trying to get that money to come to them. Those people are the same people 'controlling' the eco-system.<p>Watch the edges of any movement. When you see the 'uncool' people dropping out of the game, then there is something wrong in the middle. Watch the cycle of money - when investors are giving money to a company, which then takes that money and buys another company who also received money from the same company, then it means that people are using cyclical methods to 'invest' other peoples money, and then get themselves paid out.<p>There is no innovation problem - new and good products are being created everyday. That's fine. The boom lies in this financial layer that the financial geeks are building on top of the natural process of innovation - and the methods that are being used are there to benefit the companies participating in the financing.",1304853883

I'm sure they'll find some way to postulate that btc as a currency is technically illegal, but even if they didn't, you have to know that everything that is big in government and the power scene right now is going to collude to take btc out of the picture as far as possible. They are going to marginalize and destroy it as much as they can.<p>The government hates it because it's difficult to track the money; they'll claim it's used for terrorism, money laundering, and other forms of illegal funding, and as you know, once such a claim is solidified in the public psyche it doesn't really matter what statute the actual legal charge is based on. They'll also hate it because it makes taxation much more difficult. You may argue that cash does the same, but cash still originates and terminates in the government's officially sponsored banking system and it bears official government markings that are used to track its movement. Cash has also been (intentionally) corralled into disuse by the major financial players (governments, banks, huge businesses).<p>The banks will hate it because it cuts them out of their usual money-shifting shenanigans, which are both obscenely profitable and generally amoral, if not in principle, then in practice due to gouging and misrepresentation.<p>Bitcoin allows easy and practically free e-commerce. Bitcoin allows for extremely innovative new banking interfaces and practices. Bitcoin is at least practically if not technically unbound by the onerous regulations and rules that bankers have installed for themselves to help control which people are allowed to play with them.

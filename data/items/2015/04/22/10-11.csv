If I blast a millimeter-sized piece of your finger with neutrons the body dose might be extremely small, but that piece of finger tissue might itself become radioactive and the newly-made-radioactive atoms in it will keep irradiating the cells around. Then some of them will get cancer mutations. Then some of them will go long enough along the path to cancer. Then some of them will metastasize...<p>The girl seems to have a good understanding of dose safety. But a poor understanding of biological effects, just like everyone else. Beta vs alpha vs gamma radiation have very different biological effects and sieverts, the measuring units that take some of these differences into account, are a gross over simplification. You can kill someone with a radiation dose well below the lethal one in Sv and you can survive a dose above the lethal one...<p>Biological systems have very complicated relationships with radiation in general, that&#x27;s why even the health impact of non-ionizing radiation needs to be investigated (yeah, your cellphone is most likely safe ;) ...but you know that you have at least some cells in you body that respond even to non-ionizing EM radiation - they are in your eyes and thanks to them you can read this :) )",1429700126

(2) Most Oracle customers are not very tech companies, and have mixed quality employees. As a result, there is little pressure on building a robust, correct product, rather than one which meets a feature checklist.

LiFe batteries have longer lifetimes, are safer (less likely to catch fire or explode), are less finicky about how they get charged (more like lead-acid), seem to be potentially a bit cheaper, easier to use in multi-cell configurations (cell-balancing issue related), etc. You can also source or sink more current, so faster to charge/discharge. Downside is 14% less energy density which is why they don&#x27;t get used in laptops or smartphones and (in Tesla&#x27;s case) sometimes also not in cars. But that&#x27;s not much of a downside for (off-)grid storage..<p>Pretty sure there&#x27;s a gap in the market there just waiting for someone to jump into.

Just check the loc count on something as common as Hadoop (close to 1 million [1]) and that is excluding the &quot;stack&quot; described in the article. I wanna bet you, because we all know how volatile the job market is that even the guys building or supporting the software did not write or read even half of that code.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.openhub.net/p/Hadoop/analyses/latest/languages_summary"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openhub.net/p/Hadoop/analyses/latest/languages_s...</a>",1429697622

It also was pretty close to be a much bigger problem.<p>They are both very very important nuclear incidents which should be taken seriously. And they are remembered because of that. Chernobyl, though, was much more dangerous and uncontrolled.<p>In the big scheme of things, they are dwarfed in impact for huge natural disasters like Haiti&#x27;s earthquake in 2010 or the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

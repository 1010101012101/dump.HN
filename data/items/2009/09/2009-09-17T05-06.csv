Note I didn't say money doesn't matter.<p>Let me illustrate by paraphrasing the conversations I have on occasion.<p><pre><code>  Ordinary Programmer: I'm quitting.
  Me: Why?
  OP: I can get $15k more at X.
  Me: Will you stay if I match it?
  OP: Yes.

  Great Programmer: I'm quitting.
  Me: Why?
  GP: I've got a great opportunity to work over at X with Y  doing Z.
  Me: Look, I can't afford to lose you: If it's a matter of money I'll match it. 
  Me: Perhaps we can see how Z might work for us....
  GP: Actually I'm pretty keen on working with Y. 
  GP: It's not about the money, believe it or not I'm taking a bit of a cut.
  Me: I see. Is there anything I can do to make you stay?
  GP: Nope. Hey, once I'm settled in you should come and meet Y.</code></pre>",1253166810

BeOS was impressive but I guess Linux can be made to play a dozen videos at the same time, too. And I usually stick with only one.<p>But the user space and the user interface are brilliant!<p>I would trade Gnome, KDE, Windows, OS X, or $NAMEIT for the BeOS userland any day, both as an end-user (wrt. UI) and as a developer (user-space API). I hope we'll have more choice in the future.",1253166577

In my recollection, you generally get a list of language-level constructs and that's it. For example, the names of those exceptions are not as useful as the text you've shown there. If VS does that for exceptions, great! Contrast it with the 2003/2005 IntelliSense feature, where you just get method prototypes.",1253166422

Several years ago I ran the BeOS R5 livedisk, and while this is reminiscent, since I'm running in a virtual environment it falls short.<p>Running BeOS on the metal was amazing - setting a thread to realtime would make it really snappy, and it's just not the same when it's virtualized...<p>Either that or Haiku has some way to go yet - I can't tell...<p>EDIT: you know what?  actually, this is still really impressive...  it DOES behave a lot like BeOS, and it's alpha...  I crashed firefox, and gdb popped right up.  I dropped into a shell (bash) and there was a GNU style environment right there.  That's actually really cool!",1253165936

827499,comment,827358,827468,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I often explain monads to laypeople as ""It's a way to abstract away extra information that's passed through the computation, and define arbitrary ways to handle that information.""  One of the possible types of ""extra information"" that may be attached are the types of exceptions thrown: see the Error monad.<p>And yeah, monads have most of the same problems that checked exceptions do.  Each action in the monad must have the same type; you can't just ignore one of those bits of extra information and declare that it doesn't matter in this context.  For example, if your complicated algorithm writes to a log file, you probably don't care in the rest of the program and could just as easily treat it as pure.  But the type system won't let you, unless you fall back on cheats like unsafePerformIO.<p>I dunno really what the right answer for this is, but I really like the Erlang philosophy toward errors.  ""Let it crash, then do something simpler.""  Instead of trying to enumerate all the ways your program can fail, it just assumes that you <i>will</i> fail sometimes, so you ought to try multiple ways to succeed instead.  That requires quite a paradigm shift from the way programmers normally think about programming, though.",1253165622

827481,comment,827190,827363,0,0,skolor,,,"You have to figure: Color Blindness is a recessive trait (at least in humans, I don't know about other species). In order for it to survive, and even increase in expression over the course of human evolution, it has to carry with it some benefits (admittedly, it is also carried on the X chromosome, which has found to be highly linked to IQ). You also find color blindness in several species of animals, particularly those that are predators.<p>To be honest, it isn't an optimization. Its a trade off, that has benefits. An example would be being able to see infra-red light. You would be able to see more colors, which comes with all sorts of advantages (distance the color carries, how well it reflects, what it reflects off of, etc), but the trade off would be you would be even worse off when looking at a pattern. For whatever reason, the human brain (at least, this may be true for other species) considers color to encode quite a bit of information, and it is quite high up on the list of things to process.",1253163913

No he's not, he's misunderstanding the problem. The problem isn't how to make reliable software, it's how to best understand a problem and describe a solution.

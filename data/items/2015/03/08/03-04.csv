And I&#x27;ve always felt incredibly limited as a consequence. E.g. given the popularity of Rust, I&#x27;m really interested in type systems to limit aliasing. But the papers make my eyes glaze over. Self-teaching is difficult, because even the stuff written with an eye towards approachability assumes mastery I don&#x27;t have of a couple of years worth of discrete math.",1425787195

9164465,comment,9163921,9164424,0,0,thinkdevcode,,,"> You witness those who&#x27;ve made it as devs<p>If you read my other comment you also read the part where I said I have been around a lot of terrible developers (worked with, for, under, around, consulted for, etc). These people have &quot;made it&quot; as you said, with long careers in software development, but they are far from competent. Which leads us to your next point:<p>> how many of them end up as decent developers<p>I don&#x27;t honestly think where or how you start can be used as any sort of determination for how &quot;decent&quot; you are. What matters to me is passion (i&#x27;ve said this a few times already in other comments). When I am hiring and interviewing developers to bring on to the team I barely look at their resumes and I definitely don&#x27;t look at their education history. Whats more important to me is the initial call, and then the face-to-face. I don&#x27;t even bother asking any real technical questions. What i&#x27;m looking for is a spark; something that tells me this person loves to build and learn. Self-taught or university taught makes no difference at the end of the day, and should never be used as basis to judge whether a person is a &quot;decent&quot; developer or not.",1425787147

Personally I studied computer engineering which is essentially the hard classes from computer science combined with the hard classes from electric engineering.  I suck at algorithms. I have a hard time with abstract theories.  I contribute to open source not too much but I do.  I started in .net and now try to stick to JavaScript and node or rails.  I have held titles of architect, director, and team lead.  My favorite title though is &quot;engineer&quot;.<p>The answer to this question is very simple. It&#x27;s not school vs self-taught.

9164458,comment,9163984,9163984,0,0,HashNuke,,,"SCREENSHOTS - <a href=""http://imgur.com/a/k9mCf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/k9mCf</a> (read notes below)<p>For people who have negative opinions about this, hold on. There&#x27;s more to the DigitalLocker than you think. I tried using this the day it launched (a few weeks ago). Here are a few things for people who haven&#x27;t tried it.<p>1.) Apart from storing documents, the other important feature is to share documents with entities (seems like both govt and private). Right now in India, for anything new you want to signup for in the offline world, you are usually asked for multiple ID and address proofs. This site has a feature to share stored documents when entities request for it. So you get document requests from entities (just like Facebook friend requests) and you approve them to share the documents required. Way better than having to carry xerox copies to the office of the entity.<p>2.) It also looks like entities can issue you documents. If implemented, then we wouldn&#x27;t have to about carrying and safe-guarding physical copies of documents. I have about 20-30 physical documents I need to safe-guard and more than a dozen marks cards from college. Imagine just receiving a notification that the document for your new insurance policy has been received in your digital locker? Ah such minimalistic life.<p>3.) Love the simple Aadhaar-based login process. That is so layman-friendly. Entered my Aadhaar card number to get an OTP to login. Most Indian govt sites have ridiculous rules about setting passwords - all of which I cannot remember at all. Even worse changing your account email or password on those sites is a nightmare. To change the email address on the Service Tax website, I have to write a paper-based request to the authority.<p>4.) You can store any document you want to. This isn&#x27;t limited to government issued IDs. There&#x27;s an &quot;other&quot; category when uploading.<p>5.) I&#x27;ve been using Dropbox to store scanned copies of my family&#x27;s important documents. It has come handy many times. It is the govt offering to digitally store govt-issued documents. Why would I bother about privacy? I&#x27;m glad they made this.<p>6.) About the SSL cert: AFAIK they seem to have broken the site during a recent update. SSL was fine during the launch day. Oh, and when the Indian govt website specifies &quot;beta&quot; version - they literally mean it. And this site isn&#x27;t as bad as booking a Railway tatkal ticket on IRCTC, for which there are tutorials and videos on how to use the site. I&#x27;ve forgotten my IRCTC username/password again and I&#x27;ve exhausted all mobile numbers in the house to signup for new account. I&#x27;ll have to get a new sim just to book a railway ticket next time.<p>Mailed the DigitalLocker team my concerns about the 10mb limit and also offered to send code contributions if it was opensource. I got back a very quick reply:<p><pre><code>  It is not a open source project, but you can contribute by your valuable suggestions as it is still running in beta Version.\n  \n  Regarding Storage space we have noted the issue. Inconvenience regretted.\n  We shall review and resolve the same as soon as possible.\n</code></pre>\nBesides it&#x27;s been mentioned in the FAQ, that the storage limit will be increased to 1gb in the future <a href=""https://digitallocker.gov.in/Resources/FAQ-Digital_Locker_v0_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://digitallocker.gov.in/Resources/FAQ-Digital_Locker_v0...</a><p>[EDIT: I&#x27;ve edited my comment multiple times to add more information]",1425786992

This is OK if you&#x27;re using them as approximations - which is the common use of floats - but the fact floats are exact on the integers up to a large ceiling is useful (see Javascript) as with many other of their exactness properties.<p>Even better might be a symmetric level-index number system; you get the advantages of logarithmic number systems but <i>also</i> get immunity from overflow and underflow - the only operation that isn&#x27;t closed is division by 0 and since operations can&#x27;t underflow <i>all</i> 0s are actually 0.<p>If it were me implementing a new very-high level language with only weak cares about speed (eg. faster than doing it symbolically), I&#x27;d probably choose to use fixed precision fractions that fall back to symmetric level-index numbers instead of rounding. That way I&#x27;d get precise rationals (including int64s), immunity from underflow and overflow and a smoother error curve than floats.<p>---<p>Some people are pretty surprised to hear me criticize decimal types, but they&#x27;re genuinely numerically worse than binary floating point.

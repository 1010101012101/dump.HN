The post mentioned GMail spam filtering - it&#x27;s hard to make a good filter without the level of data Google has. Cloudflare&#x27;s ability to protect you from threats is another great example - by centralizing traffic of so many web services under one command, they can notice the threat against one and immediately set up defenses for everyone.<p>Another benefit of centralization is efficiency - when everything is distributed, everyone does all the same work over and over again, which could be done just once.<p>The question is, how can we keep centralized just the things that (users of them) really benefit from it, and let the rest be decentralized?",1425394798

They&#x27;ve done a lot on a few levels:<p>- For smartwatches (and possibly even wearables) they produced and shipped what I&#x27;d consider to be the first mainstream phone-connected wearable.  I&#x27;m sure it was on the big players&#x27; radar but Pebble produced a decent product relatively on time and I&#x27;m sure people learned quite a bit from them.  At the least they showed their was a market.<p>- For crowdfunding: Pebble got a MASSIVE stack of money.  Way beyond what anyone expected.  They managed the sudden increase in scale well, and I think showed that startups could be funded to the tune of $millions rather than $tens-of-thousands.<p>- For hardware startups: Pebble showed that an independent startup can compete (and continue to compete) with giants who have a vast existing customer base.  And that funding is available for that endeavour.  I also think they set the standard for communicating with customers.  I still remember their updates from factories in China.  I think they blazed something of a trail for companies that followed (Amp, Navdy, Ouya, off the top of my head).<p>Smartwatches aren&#x27;t for me - I&#x27;ve lost every watch I&#x27;ve ever owned - but I&#x27;m in awe of this team.",1425394784

The Lisp Machines were really on to something, users didn&#x27;t really have to know a lot of languages or competing systems. They also ensured good access to documentation.<p>This is also two areas where the Macintosh failed (perhaps intentionally). Though Hypercard was extensible through XCMDs and XFCNs, It was a huge leap from HyperCard to the Macintosh Toolbox, not just in difficulty, but also because of the tools and documentation simply didn&#x27;t exist on most people&#x27;s Macintoshes, and was very expensive to buy.",1425394760

For instance, a bag of apples will not be exactly 200g, it might be 205g or 195g. However, you know it will have 4 apples in it so you&#x27;re paying per apple. If you buy apples loosely then you can pick the weight and pay accordingly.<p>You can see the same for the fixed price chickens vs the organic/free-range that are priced by weight.<p>Although Tesco will no doubt try to game the system, it is in their interest to show you understandable unit prices because they want to flog their stuff cheaper than the brands.",1425394635

I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion for various species on the planet.

It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. So, that didn’t look so good.<p>But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, completely off the top of the charts.<p><i>And that’s what a computer is to me.

9137875,comment,9137552,9137552,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Reminds me of a time I was tasked to do operate lights on an amdram performance. I had a 6-channel programmable mixer to control a bunch of lights, and created something like 12-20 different light scenes for various parts of the performance. I wrote myself a table of light values in all scenes.<p>I quickly realized though, that manually changing power of lights will take a few seconds, and it&#x27;s easy to make an error. The mixer itself was programmable however, which meant that I could assign a particular preset of all lights to a single channel, which would then serve to interpolate this preset from no power to full power. So I coded myself a Lisp program that took all my 12-20 scenes and reduced them to 6 channels at different power settings. So instead of changing 6 different lights between scenes, all I had to do to kill one channel and move another to a power level my program computed. For each scene now I just had a note like &quot;Channel 2 - 50%&quot;, or &quot;Channel 5 - 66%&quot;, etc.<p>It was somewhat brutish and inelegant approach, but solved my particular problem.",1425394250

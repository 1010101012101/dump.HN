Bear with me on this...<p>The key difference between a traditional academic lecture and a TED talk is the <i>audience</i>.  Here, the TED audience functions as a cultural sieve. Yes, a &quot;dumbing down,&quot; relatively speaking, but then again, lay audiences <i>are</i> so by definition; academic lectures are attended by self-selected experts in a given field.  TED audiences, on the other hand, are usually a collection of diverse specialists and semi-specialists from <i>different</i> fields, and thus may be considered a lay audience for all intents and purposes.  Moreover, the internet audience is almost entirely a lay audience.<p>The benefit of TED is, as others have stated, the &quot;cross-pollination&quot; of ideas that one would likely not have exposure to in other ways.  And, unfortunately, that implies a lay audience, with all that it entails.<p>So, yes, that implies showmanship.  It implies humor.  It implies oratory skills.  Because that&#x27;s how you reach a lay audience.<p>Good presentation has much in common with good leadership skills.  Per Howard Gardner, there are 3 key points that many good public speakers and leaders possess (<a href=\"http://ecglink.com/library/ps/stories.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ecglink.com/library/ps/stories.html</a>):<p>1. Having a central story\n2. Fitting the story to the audience\n3. Data is not enough.<p>This is something that speakers like Gladwell get.<p>It also means that academic lecturers need to up their game.  And this gives them a model for what a lay audience wants.<p>I once had a lecturer who was very proud to tell his postgrads &quot;real science is boring&quot;.  Yes, it often is.  And for those of us who can stomach boring, it&#x27;s a paradise of intellectual nourishment.<p>But most people aren&#x27;t like that.  Most people need shiny things to guide them.<p>Is this fundamentally a good thing?  Probably not.  But we don&#x27;t have the luxury of pre-screening an audience through self-selection, as is the case with most academic audiences.  An academic may be absolutely brilliant, but if he/she can&#x27;t connect with the lay audience, it does no good for the ideas he/she espouses.<p>Just view the TED talk by Marvin Minsky to see a good academic flounder in front of a lay audience.\n<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/marvin_minsky_on_health_and_the_human_mind.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ted.com/talks/marvin_minsky_on_health_and_the_hum...</a><p>Take home point: yes, this is a dumbing down.  Take it for what it is.  Instead of complaining that audiences don&#x27;t react to dry academic lectures, academics need to study people like Malcolm Gladwell to emulate his delivery and rhetorical style, <i>without</i> sacrificing their academic integrity.  Easier said than done, but there are plenty of substantive talks on TED to suggest it <i>is</i> possible. If indeed the medium is the message, then academics lecturing to lay audiences need to get the message.<p>P.S. For those worried about TED&#x27;s influence on academia, methinks it will be minimal.  Academia is a very conservative endeavor, and whereas sales-pitch talks (like TED) may get sexed up, academic lectures to academic peers will continue in their wonderfully &quot;boring&quot; approach, for many years to come (and thank goodness for that).  Why? Because academics will never cease to try to poke holes in others&#x27; ideas.  Intellectual snark works in academia.  It doesn&#x27;t work with a lay audience.  However, narrative <i>does</i>.",1387291446

AIUI they can be very disruptive to track maintenance (particularly given modern safety regulations[1]); they also require paying staff, keeping stations open during the night, leasing nonstandard carriages that can&#x27;t be used for anything during the day (which in turn means either dedicated locomotives or careful scheduling and shunting, something that modern railways try to eliminate as much as possible). Certainly the sleeper train to Scotland is heavily subsidized and I believe the one to Cornwall is as well (less confident of that though). With Eurostar, AIUI the government even bought and fitted out sleeping carriages in the early days of the channel tunnel, before they turned the whole thing over to a private company to operate - which then concluded that night services would be uneconomic, and sold the carriages off cheaply to Canada.<p>The ghost trains you link to are more about a legal obligation; even if they cost the relevant companies a lot of money to run, they don&#x27;t have any alternative. (And honestly an off-peak daytime service, when the trains are already out and the staff already on shift, isn&#x27;t really comparable).<p>[1] Which are not unreasonable IMO - people have been killed by e.g. a train on the track <i>next to</i> the one they were working on.",1387291391

Like anything, given enough time, TED will have to fight off self promotion and the recycling of ideas to remain pure and relevant, but I am confident that the fight is worth fighting.<p>I have a friend who teaches middle school Biology, and his students (in his words) &quot;light up&quot; whenever they watch a great TED talk about the similarities between chickens and dinosaurs or the way a gecko can swim through the air while falling based on something way up it&#x27;s evolutionary tree. I think science-driven TED talks fill a great purpose in inspiring people that may not (yet) be scientifically minded.<p>Perhaps it isn&#x27;t as bad as Bratton believes it is, because I can still show a good TED talk to my non-techy mother or father and blow their minds. My father is a deep thinker, but just doesn&#x27;t come across deep or novel ideas very often in daily life. He is a football coach, so he just doesn&#x27;t get a lot of that between dealing with kid problems and trying to win. TED has been wonderful for delivering him a nice, distilled idea to think about.<p>If nothing else, TED gives the general populace a starting point for the state of high-level research and a chance to think about something other than their mortgage or drama on twitter. And it does so in a manner that can be highly entertaining. It is sadly surprising how many people live a whole day, a whole month or a whole year without being inspired by anything at all.

That&#x27;s problematic for the profession, given how early someone can max out his earnings early in his career. A proficient developer with 5 years development experience can earn 125k fairly easily, which is around 80% of the apparent industry max. So there&#x27;s not much incentive to improve one&#x27;s craft beyond the minimum in a salaried track.<p>Most devs I know who&#x27;ve broken above 150k fall into one of two categories: startup founders or freelancers. That clearly resonates with the &quot;break from the pack&quot; pitch in the article. The founder path is difficult and risky, but fairly understood at this point (no one is surprised if a successful startup pays their founders well).<p>Conversely, A lot of people are surprised by how much a successful freelancer can earn. There&#x27;s still an industry misconception that the skilled people must prefer salaried work and that contractors are somehow in a second tier. But 150k is a fairly easy goal to hit for a new freelancer. Someone billing at 125/hr for 1,200 hours will reach that in pre-tax dollars.<p>That&#x27;s only assuming a 60% utilization rate (there are around 2,000 total billable hours in a year).

This will completely out you unless you leave the cell phone in the same location <i>all the time</i> or for extremely large portions of time (a (1 - O(1/n))-sized proportion of your time) where n is the number of Tor sessions you want to perform.  That&#x27;s a bit pessimistic -- you could improve things by scheduling your Tor activity at times you would never be moving your cell phone anyway, and at times other people would consistently never be moving theirs -- a certain hour of the day.  For example, suppose you never move your cell phone between 5 and 6 AM -- that&#x27;s just a pattern in your life, and a pattern in others&#x27; lives, and if you scheduled your activity in that hour, you&#x27;d leak information much more slowly.  But eventually, as more and more active cell phone users have the occasion to use their phone in the wee hours, it&#x27;ll leak.<p>You also need to treat your personal internet activity and also perhaps electricity consumption (depending on metering technology) the same way as cell phone activity in this regard.  You can&#x27;t be going out using Tor at 5-6 AM some days and then be home browsing YouTube at 5-6 AM a small-ish proportion of the other days -- they&#x27;ll nab you with 99.9999999% certainty in no time.<p>Edit:  And you can&#x27;t even be tired, or energetic, or have any measurable change in social activity before or after the Tor session either, of course.",1387290662

Now perhaps from a civil unrest viewpoint it&#x27;s better to have the plebians thinking they have a shot at changing the great ship of state by the traditional democratic process, but I doubt the founders would have believed it.<p>This &quot;rights-centric&quot; view of the founding is a bit of historical revisionism that seems to be in vogue as of late. The framers saw republicanism, federalism, democratic accountability, and separation of powers as the key bulwarks against excess government power, not the Bill of Rights. That&#x27;s why the Constitution is almost wholly preoccupied by defining a blueprint for these things.<p>Only one of the 85 Federalist Papers is primarily concerned with individual rights, and it&#x27;s an argument for why a Bill of Rights is unnecessary: <a href=\"http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_84.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thomas.loc.gov/home/histdox/fed_84.html</a>. In Federalist 84, Hamilton makes the argument that a Bill of Rights is unnecessary in a democratic republic. In the context of the freedom of the press, he writes:<p>&quot;What signifies a declaration, that &#x27;the liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved&#x27;? What is the liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security, whatever fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general spirit of the people and of the government. [3] And here, after all, as is intimated upon another occasion, must we seek for <i>the only solid basis of all our rights.</i>&quot; (emphasis added).<p>> This, along with changing up the figureheads at the top of the corrupt political system regularly, has kept a lid on social unrest for a good long time. Here&#x27;s hoping that continues along unimpeded.<p>Well obviously we don&#x27;t see eye-to-eye on whether its worthwhile to fix the spying issue, because we apparently disagree about whether it&#x27;s a defect in an otherwise fairly sound system, or a symptom of irreparable corruption. I will say this, however: revolutions are rarely democratic processes. They are, more often than not, a way for radicals and other ideological minorities to impose their viewpoints on the majority.

The most dangerous centralization is at the ISP level, because it&#x27;s the first gateway to the internet. When I saw the article title I was hoping it would be about that. Unfortunately, wired internet connections make for a really good natural monopoly, so until we have super fast wireless internet everywhere, I don&#x27;t expect a solution. If any wifi mesh net appears, it would be a good start, but I&#x27;m skeptical it would become widespread.<p>The other dangerous centralization of the internet is the DNS system. I know, technically it&#x27;s decentralized because there even thousands of root name servers. But politically it&#x27;s centralized under ICANN. Domains are controlled by registrars and governments. That&#x27;s not necessarily a bad thing, but a truly distributed system would help guarantee a neutral internet. There are some good solutions for this already, namely Namecoin (<a href=\"http://dot-bit.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dot-bit.org</a>), which uses proof of work and a bitcoin-like blockchain as a P2P DNS. Namecoin uses the .bit TLD, but probably the largest barrier to adoption is that it&#x27;s not accessible by default on devices because it&#x27;s not ICANN sanctioned and therefore not in the root name servers. There are workarounds for this. ICANN could add Namecoin to the root servers but then it would still be under the control of ICANN. The true solution would be for ISPs to add it to their DNS. If the ISP decentralization is solved, this becomes trivial.<p>In my opinion, this is the only real way to guarantee net neutrality and prevent censorship.",1387289657

Not to mention that the author fails to mention how important, in passenger volume terms, are some of the routes he mentions e.g. Barcelona-Paris, come one, +800km on a train it isn&#x27;t going to be cheap nor fast.

Add to that the need to be there 45min before the plane departs, and any of the usual delays. That&#x27;s at least 1h 15min of my day gone in commuting to travel. If I travel by train my commute is not that different than that of going to work by bike, needless to say that the train gate closes 2min before departure, not 45min.<p>> Location: the train station being located at the city centre is extremely convenient, forget about getting a taxi and bumping into traffic, paying arbitrary &quot;airport&quot; fares, etc.<p>> Comfort: the leg space, seat width, baggage allowance, etc knocks out air travel. I can open my laptop on a tray way bigger than those on planes and comfortably work all the journey with my 3G/4G connection and get real work done.<p>> Flexibility: train frequency is much higher than that of planes, so finding a time that fits my agenda is not a problem.

Nation-states have the ability to issue currency by policy, to remove currency from circulation through taxes, and resolve international disputes (with military force, if necessary.) Bitcoin, through its decentralized nature, has none of this.<p>And before anyone checks in saying that it&#x27;s impossible to get 51+% of the Bitcoin node network... you don&#x27;t understand the level of resources that banks can bring to bear if they have the right motivation. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if we see one or more of them collude to take over the Bitcoin cloud and print money for their own purposes. If they could do it with LIBOR, they can do it with Bitcoin. Goldman Sachs has been driving up the price of Aluminum by controlling a significant portion of the global stock and keeping it out of circulation. It&#x27;s naive to think that these companies couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t exploit the fact that Bitcoin is almost entirely unregulated: if they can get control of the node network and print money, it&#x27;s not clear there&#x27;s anything illegal about it.",1387289396

They&#x27;re just not noticed immediately because of relative &#x27;obscurity&#x27; to an existing paradigm we have built around imperative and structured models of computing. This is the real difference between the past and now - in the past they were free to explore without restraint, but now we are carrying baggage that can&#x27;t simply be dropped (The requirement to remain compatible with C, JS or whatnot, and worse, the unwillingness of many programmers to learn new things.)<p>Even C had baggage, from (B)CPL and Algol. C wasn&#x27;t some magical innovation that appeared, but the result of incremental improvements to an existing paradigm, and the popularity of C++, Java and the likes happen for the same reason.<p>Conversely, LISP was hugely innovative because it introduced a new paradigm for thought and experiment, which led to even more new ideas appearing that wouldn&#x27;t have been discovered if we were only stuck in an imperative world, but some of those ideas were then able to be brought back into the imperative world which brings about more innovations. Likewise, integrating procedural ideas into the mathematical world has brought about new innovations too.<p>I don&#x27;t see languages like Dart as very innovative because they barely add anything new to the mindset. It&#x27;s largely existing ideas that have been tried before, getting rid of some of the bad ideas of past, and putting it together in a neat package, however, it&#x27;s still very much in the same existing paradigm, and incremental improvements to an existing paradigm only tend to solve small problems.<p>Bigger problems will be solved by completely new ways of thinking, but one needs to be able to abandon existing frameworks in order to explore them, then worry later about how to integrate the good ideas into existing models.

I&#x27;d have to think a bit about why there is a separate log file for each branch. It seems that there&#x27;s some redundancy in doing that, and I&#x27;m wondering what the advantages and disadvantages are of splitting the history up in that way.<p>Think of each branch as a pointer. Then realize that you can make that pointer point <i>anywhere</i> on the DAG, even to parts of the DAG that have no connection to each other. The `reflog` is a (local, non-comprehensive) history of where that pointer has pointed. That&#x27;s why there is a separate log for each branch. I guess that technically they could have a single log file and add another field to specify the branch, but using the same directory tree structure as under .git/refs/ makes the mental model simpler (and probably a performance improvement not to have to parse the reflog for <i>every</i> branch just to see the reflog for one branch).<p>> I&#x27;ve developed a loathing of excessive hierarchies/trees, so I&#x27;d rather see them flattened in a single directory. But that makes sense.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what branches living under .git/refs has to do with excessive hierarchies/trees.

For longer trips, planes win. Period.<p>To me, the HST is what makes the train able to compete with the car for medium-distance travel. Let&#x27;s take an example from Germany: Hamburg to Frankfurt. It&#x27;s about 500km, which takes 4-5 hours by car. The HST link takes 3:30h - if you take the time from station to station. But that&#x27;s not a fair comparison, because generally you do not want to go from station to station but from some place in Hamburg to some place in Frankfurt. If we add an hour of traveling by local public transportation, we arrive at a local trip time of 4:30, in the same range as the car. The HST has made traveling by train a viable option - not insanely fast, but comparable to the car.<p>Mass transit is slow compared to cars. HST is fast.

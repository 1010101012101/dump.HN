The OP is saying that the way things are doesn&#x27;t make much sense.<p>My guess is that the thinking goes something like this: White hats aren&#x27;t going to hack us anyway, and will be fine with the tiny rewards we give them.  So there&#x27;s no reason to increase the rewards for them.  Black hats probably aren&#x27;t going to be dissuaded even by very high rewards, or perhaps even with high rewards they&#x27;d try to have their cake and eat it too, selling exploits first and then reporting them.  Basically, they can&#x27;t be trusted so trying to buy them off with a fair-market price isn&#x27;t even worth it, so we may as well ignore them in our pricing strategy.<p>I don&#x27;t know if that reasoning is correct, but I think approximates the thinking that leads to the status quo in this case.",1391108135

The truth is there are a myriad of factors at play, but what we can say is that starting poor ends up being a big disadvantage to overcoming poverty in our current system. It&#x27;s not about downplaying this factor, it&#x27;s about recognising there are other factors at play, including factors that can tip the odds in someone&#x27;s favour, the main one being education (and an enriching social life, but that&#x27;s harder to mandate).<p>Look at countries like India, they still have huge issues with poverty, but it&#x27;s also clear that the focus on education has been instrumental in their growth in personal income. The issue with countries like the US is coupling poverty with a system that does not have the same broad level of commitment to education. The situation will continue to get worse, but it doesn&#x27;t have to, that&#x27;s the real tragedy.",1391108028

You&#x27;ll notice the examples already assume a selected element and leave much of this heavy lifting out.</i><p>You don&#x27;t really need jQuery for that, though. You just need a forEach-like function that works with NodeLists. This is easily implemented in three lines of JavaScript.<p>> <i>Furthermore, jQuery offers the selection simplicities of Sizzle (ie: &quot;#div .container .item). To do the same selection process in vanilla JS, I&#x27;ll need to nest 2 getElementsByClassName functions in a getElementByID function, and return the concatenated results from each potential .container. That is to say nothing of more complex selectors.</i><p>Not since IE8. These days, you can just do document.querySelectorAll(&#x27;#div .container .item&#x27;). For most common selectors like the one you showed, Sizzle ends up delegating to this method anyway.

Automated testing is a convenience that saves you from doing manual testing.  Unit testing is a convenience that catches test failures before commit rather than during the automated testing phase.  Creating the unit test, well, is it more convenient to create 8 interfaces and completely change the way the code is structured, or is it more convenient to mock out the singleton?

When the server is killed by the OOM killer or when power of the server fails or the network connection between the client and the server fails (for too long) while the commit is in progress, the client also doesn&#x27;t get an explicit response, and thus also doesn&#x27;t know whether the commit succeeded or not, so it has to deal with that case anyhow - and if it doesn&#x27;t lose data in that case, it won&#x27;t lose data on SIGKILL either.<p>And the whole point of a journal is that it doesn&#x27;t need to be clean. If your database requires the journal to be clean on startup as a condition for its correctness, then the journal is useless, it could just as well just require the data itself to be consistent. The only reason why there is a journal is so that correctness is not affected when writes are interrupted as any point.<p>Also, for that matter, a SIGTERM might be able to guarantee that the journal is clean, but it would be highly broken if it tried to guarantee that the client gets to know about the result, as that could take an arbitrary amount of time that might be dependent on the behaviour of remote systems, which would be terrible shutdown behaviour indeed.<p>Really, the only reason why a database should even try and catch SIGTERM is when checkpointing on shutdown is a lot cheaper than log recovery on startup - other than that, it only makes the code more complicated without providing any benefits.",1391106536

AFAICT that&#x27;s more or less exactly what&#x27;s going on.<p>Also, in the US, from c. 1960-1990 labor unions had a monopoly on unskilled labor in many domestic markets, which allowed the price of labor (i.e. wages) to move away from a competitive pricing model and get closer to monopoly pricing model.  Globalization allowed companies to break the unions&#x27; monopoly on labor by moving operations to other countries.<p>The solution is simple and obvious:  If producing X in country Y saves you D dollars due to lower wages, laxer safety/environmental regulations, lower taxes [3], etc., you should tax those goods by D dollars when they cross your border.  However, the money that can be made by avoiding monopoly labor pricing means that the business community successfully bribes / lobbies politicians.  Even educated voters are largely ignorant of economics, and politicians can usually come up with rhetoric to support just about any economic policy they want, so the voters don&#x27;t provide enough political force to stand up for their interests in a way that&#x27;s effective.<p>Warren Buffett talked some years ago about why we need to have tariffs [2].

While using jQuery, I can emit a $(&quot;.class&quot;).hide() call, which will apply to all elements with the matching class. Simple and elegant.<p>However, using native JS as the page suggests, I will need to construct a loop within my function, especially if I&#x27;m using the DOM supported getElementsByClassName method, returns a pseudo-array of DOM nodes which don&#x27;t have the style method available on them. You&#x27;ll notice the examples already assume a selected element and leave much of this heavy lifting out.<p>Furthermore, jQuery offers the selection simplicities of Sizzle (ie: &quot;#div .container .item). To do the same selection process in vanilla JS, I&#x27;ll need to nest 2 getElementsByClassName functions in a getElementByID function, and return the concatenated results from each potential .container. That is to say nothing of more complex selectors.<p>So yes, if you&#x27;re addressing the absolute simplest form of selection, this works, but otherwise I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s really presenting the situation honestly.",1391105550

There answer to my enquiry as how one can proove that they are legit owners of a domain in the evnt of a domain dispute were time and time again fobbed off. They have suggested I be content with the receipt available for download by logging into my account but that is nothing but acknowledgemnet of receiving payment for an order placed with them to register a certain domain but is definitely not a certificate of regsitration or another similar.They just point blank refuse to answer my emails despite numerous phone calls all lasting over 45 mins a pop. SO BEWARE ! - shall i transfer all my domains pronto ? - this is INSANE",1391104805

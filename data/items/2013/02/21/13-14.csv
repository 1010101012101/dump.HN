I can elaborate on it a bit more. Based on the previous submission I reasoned OP is behind the blogpost. If not, my question doesn't make sense.<p>Why this question? Recently I have the experience, for Android, that developing in a 4.1 world while supporting at least 3.2 is a tricky thing (and since there's quite some version fragmentation on Android, this supporting at least 3.2 is still more than reasonable). For instance, you should/want to use Fragments, but 3.2 doesn't know them. Compatibility library helps of course, but there's gaps in it and if these gaps pose a problem, you're bound to write it yourself or revert to using deprecated code (and not leveraging the 4.1 benefits there). So, no disasters there, but still tradeoffs to be made and I simply wondered what tradeoff was made here (or what part I have been overlooking, of course :). [/edit]",1361455016

An effect, not a cause. There is no necessary clash, no dichotomy between mans reason and his emotionsprovided he observes their proper relationship. A rational man knowsor makes it a point to discoverthe source of his emotions, the basic premises from which they come; if his premises are wrong, he corrects them. He never acts on emotions for which he cannot account, the meaning of which he does not understand. In appraising a situation, he knows why he reacts as he does and whether he is right. He has no inner conflicts, his mind and his emotions are integrated, his consciousness is in perfect harmony. His emotions are not his enemies, they are his means of enjoying life. But they are not his guide; the guide is his mind. This relationship cannot be reversed, however. If a man takes his emotions as the cause and his mind as their passive effect, if he is guided by his emotions and uses his mind only to rationalize or justify them somehowthen he is acting immorally, he is condemning himself to misery, failure, defeat, and he will achieve nothing but destructionhis own and that of others.""<p>- Ayn Rand, Playboy interview, March 1964",1361454366

5257299,comment,5256808,5256808,16,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Very interesting case study in how simple changes lead to emergent complex systems. Who would have thought that taking health insurance away from the person and assigning it to the employer would lead here? With every band-aid we put on the system, it just flows around and makes itself more complex. All of these systems, the paymaster, the insurance companies, the employers, the drug companies, the trial lawyers, etc -- they live in an ecosystem we have created over time. This ecosystem was continually adjusted to solve one problem, thereby creating more complexity for all other areas.<p>For that reason, I do not believe a list of remedies is the way to go here. Especially trying to increase hospital taxes -- that has as much chance of working as spitting in the ocean increasing global sea levels.<p>Whatever we do, we have to fight the complexity actively -- even if it doesn't directly lower costs. We can understand these things as basic software architecture principles. A couple of small suggestions:<p>- Eliminate needless architectural tiers. Make it illegal for anybody but the patient to pay healthcare providers. If you have insurance, fine. The insurance company pays you, then you pay the provider.<p>- Decouple the hospital (building and administrative staff) from the services being provided<p>- Standardize components. Mandate that all services provided must be in a free and open market. That means open pricing (bidding), public consumer reporting, outsourcing if possible, and so forth.<p>- Require interoperability. One provider cannot require that another provider be used. It's the provider's responsibility to interface with other providers<p>- Establish naming conventions<p>You get the idea.<p>The point here is that we've been playing whack-a-mole. Some guy goes out and writes a wonderful article about the complexities and problems with the market. So new adjustments are made to fix them. They only create more problems, which some <i>other</i> guy goes out and writes about. Each iteration may take many years. Over time the amount of cruft and inefficiencies is staggering. If we continue with this strategy of fixing the problem it's just going to get worse.<p>This method of problem solving hurts. Let's not do that anymore.",1361454147

My first task was to interface a Mac with a high frequency generator using a data acquisition connection and a very specialized environment called LabView (sort of like Sketch but for research equipment). I had the HFG's manual as a reference and it was pretty straightforward, after I wrapped my mind around the fact that voltage of 0 was a logical 1. The ""code"" (little boxes representing various devices and virtual wires connecting them) was complete and actually pretty straightforward after a refactor or two. Except it did not work. No errors were raised but the HFG did not produce a frequency. I spent Thursday and Friday debugging it and left the lab very frustrated. This was my first project and I wanted to be taken seriously. Looking back I was probably putting too much pressure on myself about this really minor thing.<p>So far as I know, nobody was in the lab over the weekend and certainly nobody would have touched my workstation. When I came back Monday the code worked. It worked the next day and the day after. The only thing that changed over the weekend: daylight savings ended.

The company supplies services (industrial) to the public and trade sector. Initially the company supplied the services from a small factory. The company has grown to be the market leader in it's field and it's brand is almost a household name among it's market. It has more enormous rankings on search engines and for what is a small cottage business receives huge traffic that is well suited to the many services the company provides. We also have a strong offline presence, we attend shows and do numerous localized and nationalized marketing hits. The company offers it's service across the whole of Europe.<p>After 18 months it made more sense to pass our work on to a larger factory that could handle the sheer volume we have.<p>That factory would now like to buy our business. Our work input has been so large they have had to employ more staff and expand their floor-space to compensate.<p>They have proposed a deal:<p>1. they buy the website and the brand\n2. they pay of it over a 3-5 year payment plan\n3. I stay on as a paid consultant to help develop into further markets and maintain postion.\n4. they want a guarantee that if the companies internet presence was to slide - effectively in their words they can seize paying<p>Point 3 causes me concern. Ideally i would like to sell it for cash, perhaps over a few payments. I'm happy to give them 3 years. I experience with them and I think the merging of our brand into their factory will be tremendous for consumers and for them. What i dont like is having to gaurantee performance of the brand over a long period. What or how is this usually dealt with.<p>Lastly. The value. We receive circa 1.25 million GBP of inquiries per year. Part of the proposition  proposal demonstrates that the turnover of the company can be greatly increased. Can potential such as this be valued?<p>Thanks for your help",1361453363

TrueTech hired Jonathan Kraij, a talented young designer to make that logo and it was featured in many places, magazines such as wave and many others besides in the late 90's.<p>Not three weeks after one prominent bout of exposure the logo appeared in an advertising campaign by Sony the Netherlands.<p>We talked it over with them and they traced it to a guy working for one of the agencies that designed the campaign. He'd most likely been subconsciously influenced by exposure from a magazine. Sony was pretty good about it, promised they wouldn't use the logo any further and paid us a fair bit of money to offset the use.<p>All in all it could have been a lot worse and I think that before you start using words like 'pirates' you have to dig a little deeper to be sure that it was intentional and that it wasn't some external party that caused this.<p>Sony is a damaged brand, they've done lots of terribly stupid stuff but at a minimum they should be given the benefit of the doubt until there is hard proof they did this on purpose. We all know Sony fucked up in the past but that is no reason to automatically assume they did so again without any proof.",1361452736

Your resume might be decent in getting a ""high school"" job like a supermarket, but it's still not great.<p>I think the Software Dev Club VP could be something, but you don't explain it at all. What is it? Did you cofound it? What do you do as VP? Accomplishments?<p>Your resume is somewhat fluff. You have skills, but it takes up >1/3 of the page without much to show for it. Try 2 column for skills. I'd also move it to the bottom, since your experience should speak for the skills you have, the skills are just a reminder^H^H^H^Hkeyword spam and list other things that may have not been included.<p>Not enough info at that point? Try speaking to some of your hackathons. It's an extracurricular thing.<p>One trick for designing resumes is to flip it upside down and look at the text as shapes rather than words. How is it balanced? Are there noticeable gaps, and are those intentional or should they be filled in?<p>Also, cover letters should be custom for each job. If you template them it's really only 1 paragraph you should have saved, and the rest should be custom per job.<p>As a high school student, don't send to jobs@. How do you even know the mail alias exists and actually gets looked at? Send to somebody.<p>EDIT: One last thing -- your resume is pretty flat. You are obviously strong technically, but you have no reference to teams or working with others. Hence why you should expand Club VP (maybe to experience section). If you do volunteering or organized something or did a Boy Scout project, I'd put that on there. You do get a bit of resume forgiveness as an intern that you don't get professionally.<p>I've looked over resumes for interns before, and basically you know that the most you can hope for is technically strong. Most of the time you want strong soft skills and they just grow technical skills through the internship. You don't show me any of the soft skills.",1361452428

IANAL, but if it's LGPLed, they can probably just include it without issue - they just need to note that the _image_ is open source, not necessarily the rest of their stuff.  The only real problem here is the lack of proper licensing (i.e. the default its-all-ours! license is too strict).<p>And totally unnecessary too, probably.  I seriously doubt this kind of software is in any way an edge over their competitors - it's probably just big corp habit.",1361451769

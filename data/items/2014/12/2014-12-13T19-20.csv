One major reason is that societies change and today&#x27;s audiences are different from audiences of 30 years ago.<p>The reason people don&#x27;t want to pay for art is not that they assign a value of zero to it; it&#x27;s that they have figured out a way to get it without paying the artist.",1418500793

Everything has moved so fast that I don&#x27;t think we understand the first principles of the system.<p>For a while I believed that all the new music production tools out there meant that the market is flooded with crappy music released by hobbyists giving it away for free.  The system affects of that sort of thing is that the listeners are bombarded, they shut down, they don&#x27;t have the opportunity to reliably discover &quot;good&quot; music, and that therefore people writing &quot;good&quot; music fall through the cracks, don&#x27;t earn money, eventually stop writing, and culture is worse off.<p>But... I&#x27;m coming around to the view that the market is pretty much flooded now with &quot;good&quot; music.  I&#x27;m being hand-wavy, defining it as merely music that deserves to exist alongside other &quot;good&quot; music.  If that&#x27;s true, then it&#x27;s a different model.  Great for the consumer, they can probably subsist on a healthy music diet received for free.  There the only path through for a musician is to try and invite fans into the &quot;family&quot; and hope fans will pay a premium for that.  But still, you&#x27;re going to have artists that write good music fall through the cracks and stop writing - it&#x27;s just that in those cases, culture isn&#x27;t necessarily worse off.",1418500722

8746153,comment,8745540,8746105,0,0,pvnick,,,"Racism&#x27;s trajectory is such that it is quickly disappearing. That is the case even in the deep south where I&#x27;m from (this is fairly profound considering our civil war defeat is still a big deal in the minds of many), but rather the racism you do encounter is in response to perceived injustices such as those I listed. Thus the hyper-vigilance perpetuated by the media does more to harm racism&#x27;s disappearance than to hasten it&#x27;s natural death.<p>Edit: Also, because racism is illogical. Irrational ideas tend to be replaced by good ones in the &quot;free market&quot; of ideas. There is no reason to beat tolerance into people, simply show show them the compassion and unity that equality leads to, and contrast that with the ridiculous KKK guys in goofy white cone hats and piss-stained bed sheets and let them make up their own mind.",1418500701

Could you at least address why these things don&#x27;t allow bitcoin to scale? It&#x27;s pretty unproductive to criticize something, then say inb4 all the reasons why most criticism is invalid. It&#x27;s like saying &#x27;Humans are stupid because a child can&#x27;t do math. inb4 comments about how adults can&#x27;. I mean why even post that?<p>Point is, 1mb limits are arbitrary, which is where the 1 TPS comes from, 1 TPS is how much transaction data fits in a 1 megabyte block. You know this, so say it.<p>And that 1 megabyte block can go to 10 megabytes. Why not to 1 billion megabytes? Because it&#x27;s expensive to process that data (network to transfer it, storage to store it, CPU to verify signatures).<p>And it&#x27;s a PERFECTLY sensible thing to then say, that moore&#x27;s law affects the ability to verify more transaction signatures. Or that Kryder&#x27;s law affects the ability to store more data. Or that Nielsen&#x27;s law allows networks to transfer more data.<p>How childish is it to say &#x27;inb4 perfectly fine reasons why my criticism is more nuanced&#x27;.<p>And yes, the blockchain can be pruned, requiring less storage. And yes filters can be used to require less data to be transferred. And yes it is possible to run light-nodes, where you only store some transactions and not others, so that you can make a small contribution to decentralisation.<p>But look at the current 1 MB blocks. That&#x27;s 1024 kilobytes every 600 seconds, or 1.7 kb per second.<p>Now look at an example, take Bitpay, they have made public that they process close to half a billion dollars a year. (yes, peanuts compared to VISA, don&#x27;t worry I know). And they&#x27;ve done this by utilizing a fraction of the bitcoin blockchain. Which itself is at a fraction of its current arbitrary 1 MB block capacity.<p>So a company that utilizes a fraction of the blockchain, which is at a fraction of full capacity, which utilizes 1.7 kb/s of network, is powering half a billion dollars of money processed per year, without any optimizations, and you&#x27;re telling me that this can&#x27;t scale up today, nor can it scale up up in the next 10 years despite moore, kryder, nielsen&#x27;s laws, even after optimizations?<p>It&#x27;s simply not true. I won&#x27;t stand here and say bitcoin can scale to 1 million VISA networks, no. I know there are limitations, and I appreciate that a distributed, redundant, decentralized system is more expensive than having to run a single centralized node.<p>I appreciate that. But this notion that bitcoin can&#x27;t scale at all to any significant TPS period is so devoid of any NUANCE.<p>And your comment about how core devs realized bitcoin can&#x27;t scale. I&#x27;ll leave you with these concluding remarks by Gavin Andresen, Chief Scientist of bitcoin&#x27;s core development who virtually completely disagrees with you.

Doesn&#x27;t make him right and you wrong in and of itself (although he&#x27;s both a very involved guy, knows what he&#x27;s talking about, but isn&#x27;t on the hype train. i.e. he still calls bitcoin &#x27;an experiment&#x27;.) but at least the notion that bitcoin core devs don&#x27;t think it can scale is, again, a lot more nuanced.<p>As for the corporate shill, freedom hater etc stuff. I hear you, that kind of sentiment from some bitcoiners got old really fast. But it&#x27;s not nearly as bad as a few years ago. A lot of cool sensible middle-ground folk have arrived who get as tired by a &#x27;you&#x27;re a corporate shill so your comment is invalid&#x27; remark by a crazy bitcoiner as a &#x27;you probably think I&#x27;m a corporate shill, so you&#x27;re a bitcoin nut whose comment is invalid&#x27; remark by people like you.<p>[0] Comments by Gavin Andresen on scalability:
<a href=""https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/a-scalability-roadmap/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitcoinfoundation.org/2014/10/a-scalability-roadmap/</a><p>There is a clear path to scaling up the network to handle several thousand transactions per second (“Visa scale”). Getting there won’t be trivial, because writing solid, secure code takes time and because getting consensus is hard. Fortunately technological progress marches on, and Nielsen’s Law of Internet Bandwidth and Moore’s Law make scaling up easier as time passes.<p>The map gets fuzzy if we start thinking about how to scale faster than the 50%-per-increase-in-bandwidth-per-year of Nielsen’s Law. Some complicated scheme to avoid broadcasting every transaction to every node is probably possible to implement and make secure enough.<p>But 50% per year growth is really good. According to my rough back-of-the-envelope calculations, my above-average home Internet connection and above-average home computer could easily support 5,000 transactions per second today.<p>That works out to 400 million transactions per day. Pretty good; every person in the US could make one Bitcoin transaction per day and I’d still be able to keep up.<p>After 12 years of bandwidth growth that becomes 56 billion transactions per day on my home network connection — enough for every single person in the world to make five or six bitcoin transactions every single day. It is hard to imagine that not being enough; according the the Boston Federal Reserve, the average US consumer makes just over two payments per day.<p>So even if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to Bitcoin in twenty years, broadcasting every transaction to every fully-validating node won’t be a problem",1418499927

To look at somebody and consciously judge them to be inferior based on their skin color is so outdated and obsolete, that those who do so are fringe members of society who are typically elderly and either changing their mindset or dying out. We elected a black president in a landslide victory for God&#x27;s sake. Twice!<p>No, what is harmful is the vindictive, hyper-vigilant collectivist attitude that persists in a ham-handed attempt at &quot;leveling the playing field.&quot; The idea that certain groups of people (blacks, women, gays, etc) need compulsory protection at the expense of other groups (white males), induces a sort of resentment as a response to what is perceived to be a witch hunt. For example, certain events - such as the destruction of Paula Dean for admitting to saying the word &quot;nigger&quot; in the past, or Brendan Eich&#x27;s dismissal as CEO for his donations against gay marriage - and certain policies - such as affirmative action or the greatly lopsided outcomes of most child custody battles - evoke an understandable, but completely irrational, feeling of resentment towards those groups as a backlash for perceived unfair treatment. It&#x27;s this &quot;us vs. them&quot; victim mentality that&#x27;s the problem in mainstream America. That&#x27;s where the real racist attitudes come from, not some sort of widespread, conscious conclusion that certain groups are intrinsically inferior to others.<p>The answer is not collectivist protections or more anti-racism vigilance, it is to look beyond our superficial differences and to consider all people as individuals with an equal capacity to love and to be loved.

My tribe is humanity.  I was not raised to think race was important, and I didn&#x27;t.  That upbringing is with me to this day. I didn&#x27;t reflexively categorize people by race, and I still don&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s not something I even notice unless attention is called to it somehow.<p>Other people from the region were raised differently.  The inland pacific northwest is a region that white supremacists like, and we had them.<p>Growing up in a racial monoculture, you could wind up totally innocent and clueless (like me) or totally racist (like some people I knew of), and probably a lot of other things.  It really depended on what you were taught.<p>The same can happen in diverse cultures, too.<p>When I moved to Seattle, there was a lot more racial diversity.  It still didn&#x27;t mean anything to me, but it clearly meant things to others, and some people made quite a big deal out of it.  I had an amusing conversation with a fellow visiting from the UK about it:<p><pre><code>    Him: So . . . what is *with* your black people?
    Me: Excuse me?
    Him: Well, back home, we have black people, too.

The racial diversity in Seattle and in the UK did not result in the same attitudes!  Of course, there are other &#x27;tribes&#x27; over on that side of the world that <i>do</i> matter.

It&#x27;s really interesting to here what conclusions he draws from some of these shows, and it&#x27;s amazing what he picks up from shows like Wild Kratts.<p>We recently got an ipad mini for travel. It was great while traveling; he starting using some apps about the human body, one that let him build robots and guide them through a maze, etc. But now that we&#x27;re done traveling for a bit, he keeps wanting to use the ipad. I want him to continue gaining exposure to devices like an ipad, but I also don&#x27;t want him to have excessive screen time. He complains loudly for about a minute when we tell him we&#x27;re finished with the ipad, but then quickly finds something interesting to do in the house.<p>What do HN parents of kids around this age do? At what age did you start setting specific time limits for screen time? At what age did you start your kids on projects specifically related to programming?

It was like a real creature wandering around interacting with it&#x27;s environment.

I am looking to scale up only to the next higher order of animals and would be very happy to get to the mouse brain in my lifetime.<p>A couple of things that make scaling up a difficult issue:<p>1) C Elegans does not grow any new neurons or synapses over it&#x27;s lifetime so it is a static model as far as the connectome. Plasticity is a whole new paradigm that my current model does not consider. I do have ideas for growing new synapses that I actually worked on around 8 years ago and with this research, should allow me to move forward.<p>2) It is hard for current computing power to handle the C Elegans nervous system with 302 neurons. The next level would be the Jelly Fish with 800 neurons. Drosophila has 100,000 neurons, and other higher order animals would be a hard problem indeed.<p>3) My model works on a fully mapped connectome. C Elegans is probably the only animal that has this attribute. The Allen Brain Institute is doing detailed mapping on the mouse brain so this might be a good direction. The Human Brain project is doing the human brain but they would be first to tell you it&#x27;s a multi-decade endeavor.<p>However, there are so many benefits to this research beyond what I have accomplished. The recursiveness of the connectome that I have found is very significant; which by the way compounds the complexity of brain science 10 fold, I am also exploring the cross connections of neuron pairs to try and find patterns and distinctions. Like all good science, we take a step forward and find many new things to explore.<p>The OpenWorm[1] project is doing exactly what you are suggesting - trying to map the connectome to a virtual body. I encourage you to look into what they are doing in more detail.<p>...However, my robot-connectome is fully autonomous and this is something we rarely see in science where we give a machine a level of intelligence we cannot control so in this regard, I firmly believe that if the singularity is met, it could be caused by a guy in his garage and the &quot;old&quot; humanity could be doomed forever more. But this is pure speculation and we won&#x27;t know until we get there but it is something to ponder and whether it&#x27;s a bad thing or good, I guess depends on your point of view.<p>Thanks for your kind words and please continue your thoughts,

Hence, where the relation of master and slave between them is natural they are friends and have a common interest, but where it rests merely on law and force the reverse is true.&quot;</i><p>and also:<p><i>&quot;And again, no one would ever say he is a slave who is unworthy to be a slave.&quot;</i><p>This would suggest that the easiest way to not be Aristotle&#x27;s slave would be to tell him to sod off and do his own cleaning, though I suspect the reality may have been different.",1418498165

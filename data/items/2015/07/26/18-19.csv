VLAs and restrict are explicitly not in C++ because they&#x27;re somewhat broken (C++14 did add &quot;dynamic arrays&quot; which are VLA-lite, and there&#x27;s work on a better restrict-like functionality, cf. <a href=""https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3988.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3988.pdf</a>), while designated initializers does not mesh well with C++ semantics.<p>In practice, then, C++ without RTTI, exceptions, or the standard library is basically a strict superset of C and C code compiled as such will tend to be legal and identical in semantics. The same cannot be said for C# or Java. Given that C++ has some rather useful features (most notably, the ability to guarantee cleanup even in the face of inattentive developers), the only real valid reason to not be using C++ instead of C is if there&#x27;s no C++ compiler.",1437937119

9951838,comment,9951394,9951579,0,0,drostie,,,"This experiment should neither prove nor disprove it. It measures a parameter of a phenomenon (neutrino oscillation) which is well-known and which is only weakly affected by the premise that neutrinos are Majoranas.<p>So, just as a quick overview, there are two ways within the Standard Model to give a particle mass, one is the Higgs mechanism where the particle couples with a field generating an effective Dirac mass; another is to sum up certain Feynman diagrams (loops and other particles and such) generating a Majorana mass. These Majorana mechanisms effectively require that the particle be a charge-neutral fermion, so bosons (force-carriers) are out, as are quarks, electrons, muons, and taus. That leaves the neutrinos as the only known particles which could get mass this way.<p>For a while, it wasn&#x27;t even known if neutrinos had mass; we now know that they do, but it&#x27;s (m) at a scale much smaller than any of the known masses (M) of the Standard Model, and just postulating, &quot;hey, the diagrams work out just right so m/M is a small number&quot; feels like a cop-out. So one of the most intriguing Majorana-mechanisms is the so-called &quot;seesaw mechanism&quot;: this postulates some symmetry breaking between the left-handed neutrinos of the Standard Model and some new right-handed neutrinos; the left-handed get ratio m/M and the right-handed I think get ratio M/m and it all sort of balances out.<p>There are two clear &quot;signatures&quot; that neutrinos are Majoranas: one would be to observe these huge right-handed neutrinos. The other is to observe two neutrinos perfectly annihilate.<p>What I think you&#x27;re thinking of: In the early 2000s there were claims that experiments had observed the latter. This is a little tricky and the process is called &quot;neutrinoless double beta decay,&quot; since a beta-decay produces an antineutrino and two antineutrinos can only annihilate if they are their own antiparticle.<p>The general consensus now is that those early experiments weren&#x27;t sufficiently reproducible and we&#x27;ve never seen neutrinoless double-beta decay. However, that doesn&#x27;t shut the door completely since double-beta-decay is already pretty rare: 76-Ge for example decays via double-beta-decay into 76-Se with a half-life of 10^21 years, or a hundred billion times the age of the universe. The GERDA experiment has been studying this stuff and can conclusively say that the half-life for <i>neutrinoless</i> double beta decay must be at least 10^25 years, and they&#x27;re looking to increase their resolution to 10^26 years: so it&#x27;s less than 1/10,000 of their decays observed so far, but they can capture it if it&#x27;s more frequent than 1/100,000.",1437936149

I&#x27;m part of a large extended &quot;tribe&quot; that has repeatedly proven its ability to mobilize substantial resources and manage large complex logistical operations with no permanent hierarchy or profit motive, and that demonstrates that there is some valuable body of social skills and experience present which, so far as I know, nobody has yet laid down in writing for others to pick up.

The problem is that the way you get notified that it has happened is that IP packets suddenly start to get delivered to the wrong machine.  If you&#x27;re lucky, the net result will simply be a dropped TCP connection.  If you&#x27;re not lucky, pretty much arbitrarily bad things can happen.<p>Now, it is true that IP is not reliable, and so arbitrarily bad things can happen at any time and you do have to be prepared for those.  The problem here is that there is no notification.  Potentially bad things are happening here not because something has gone wrong, but <i>by design</i>.  That, IMHO, is the very definition of Bad Design.<p>Normally, when you make a DNS change, you control the DNS and the affected end points.  That way you know when the change is happening, and you can give yourself as much time as you need to make the transition in an orderly way.  With ELB, the <i>only</i> guarantee you have is the TTL.  With a 60 second TTL, that means you have <i>at most</i> 60 seconds to do the transition, and even that is only if you notice it when it happens (and the only way to guarantee that is to poll the name server constantly).",1437935690

It&#x27;s also Bad Design on the part of AWS because switching IP addresses this way means you can&#x27;t keep a TCP socket open to an ELB machine for more than 60 seconds at a time because you never know when the routing rug is going to be yanked out from under you.  This makes ELB useless for anything involving a persistent connection.  No websockets for you!",1437934232

9951728,comment,9950179,9950179,0,0,throwaway009382,,,"I am both an aspiring graduate student (though, maybe not after reading this) and grew up with many friends who were/are still in organized crews, plus did some delivery for a few years myself when I was a foolish 17 yr old.<p>Most delivery driver jobs here pay $150-200/day depending on how busy the line is, and the people that work them usually aren&#x27;t looking to move up instead they want cash wages for easy work, since most have records and can&#x27;t get decent paying jobs anywhere else. The article is correct almost all these guy&#x27;s still live with their parents. There were only 2 guys I knew that actually thought they could move up and make big money while the rest of us accepted we were only ever going to make $200/day and were essentially contractors, we were never privy to any gang internal business.<p>Gangs no longer hold drugs when corner selling (where you make the most money, selling by the point at full street value), they pay an addict in drugs to do this while they run security watching over the operation to prevent robberies. Street enforcer is where you start if you want to move up since you are essentially managing operations instead of just a delivery boy. You also hang around the top people as they call on you to come along to jack rival operations. These thugs get a lucrative percentage when they steal drugs off other crews and pass them down to the delivery lines to sell so are making real money, since it seemed every enforcer in my little dope crew was bombing around in a Porsche Cayenne customized to be bullet resistant with hidden compartments installed to hide their handguns, lived in huge houses by themselves and were always decked out in latest heatbag designer clothes. I don&#x27;t remember any of these guys being broke, and technically they are the lowest rung on the gang hierarchy since the drivers are just contractors.<p>That was back in 2005 though, and now the vast majority of gangs are not handling any product here. Their income model is intimidation and extortion. It&#x27;s far easier to wave a gun around on the street and tax everybody in the drug business than it is to put in work building up a line or managing operations. They don&#x27;t even steal each other&#x27;s lines anymore, just demand a percentage of the profits. As a result street violence has actually declined, since jackings and hits decreased and most beefs are now solved by passing money over a table. These independent dealers are also way better at selling drugs than gangs, so bring in much more money and the dominant gang that taxes them also offers protection from robbery (we are robbing you to offer our robbery prevention services).<p>This gangster method is more profitable, has almost no startup costs besides needing vehicles and guns, is much harder to prosecute since they never are directly involved in narcotics trade, and has an endless recruitment pool inside prisons to replenish ranks faster and with tougher recruits. It&#x27;s also how all those Mexican border cartels operate. They are merely taxing the smuggling routes into the US skimming the shipments of Gulf and Sinaloa cartels. Those cartels have to build manufacturing, supply chain and retail while paying off politicians and police while the thug at the border just needs a gun, and is impossible to get rid of since they hold down their territory hard.<p>tl;dr Stepping into a gang as the new lowest position pays much more now, and is almost a guaranteed ladder to better positions since narcotics handling has all been outsourced as drug dealers are good at being drug dealers, and gangsters are good at being thugs.",1437933789

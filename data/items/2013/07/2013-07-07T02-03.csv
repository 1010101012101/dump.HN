The primary goal is speed (data size is small enough to fit entirely in memory, sharded across multiple machines if needed). The primary bottleneck is feature extraction, transformation and iteration, which is both CPU and read/write intensive. Model building is not too slow, so no need to distribute training/testing as of yet.<p>I&#x27;ve heard good things about Spark/Shark and Storm. Does anyone have any experiences or recommendations? Maybe we don&#x27;t even need a super sophisticated system and a Riak/Redis K-V store cluster would do?<p>Thanks in advance",1373165997

have started to convince me that
the SCOTUS role as &#x27;supreme&#x27; or
&#x27;final&#x27; is not really correct and that
Jefferson saw this.  Instead,
after the SCOTUS come the voters
who can tell Congress, e.g.,<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care what the SCOTUS says.
I&#x27;m a citizen and a voter, and I
say that what the NSA has been
doing spying on US citizens 
violates the Fourth Amendment,
and I want you to pass a law
throttling the NSA and
getting them honoring 
the Fourth Amendment.&quot;<p>And if such a law is not enough,
then the citizens can
amend the Constitution.<p>It will be nice if some plaintiff 
with standing to sue brings
a case before the SCOTUS and
wins.  E.g., maybe a class action
on behalf of all 120 million or
so Verizon customers who had their
telephone metadata grabbed by the NSA.
Apparently Google is bringing a case.",1373165923

IPython[1] is a more advanced Python shell you may like. Lots of people also swear by pdb, the Python debugger. Personally, I get less use out of it than others, but YMMV.<p>But overall, this is a problem involving documentation, design and naming, and your own mindset.<p>Ideally you would never really be put in the position of not knowing, because it would be clearly documented. Of course, we all know how well that tends to work.<p>Second, well-designed systems with good naming practices will make it fairly obvious most of the time what sort of arguments are expected, and what you can expect to get back. (This is related to the next point.)<p>Finally, coming from a &quot;static&quot; language, your brain just isn&#x27;t trained to perform its own type inference and deal with duck typing. This is mostly a matter of practice, you get better at it. But if you aren&#x27;t already familiar with various kinds of typing, be sure to do some reading. A better understanding of the differences will help make sense of what you&#x27;re seeing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ipython.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ipython.org/</a>",1373165784

First I tried Xubuntu but I quickly began to miss many of the niceties of a more featureful desktop environment. Feeling a general dissatisfaction with Ubuntu I decided to try Arch Linux. It was quite a task to configure a base system with video drivers, networking and other hardware working at a similar level that you would get out of the box with Ubuntu. But in the end I&#x27;m extremely pleased. I went with the Gnome 3 desktop because it handled a lot of things for me such as drive mounting and managing the network. I actually prefer Gnome 3 to Unity. It&#x27;s more visually pleasing and minimal. The only thing I miss is the HUD for accessing deeply-nested menu items. The best thing about Arch Linux is that most packages are the absolute latest stable versions. You don&#x27;t have to wait 6 months for an update to the official package. And if there&#x27;s no official package, the AUR system for building packages from source is better than Ubuntu&#x27;s PPA which requires you to trust binaries compiled by 3rd parties.",1373164639

At least with Java you do not need to manually break cyclic references to prevent memory leaks.<p>As for closures, why would I want to specify which variables are captured?  If I reference a variable from the enclosing environment, I capture it.  If I mask the variable, I do not capture it.  What point is there in explicitly declaring this?  Frankly, the entire C++11 approach to closures is insane.  Why add the extra syntax to explicitly declare how variables are captured, when capture by value covers all cases?<p>I stand by what I said.  C++ is an awful language.",1373163978

The Peacekeeper missile lists a CEP of 120m, although it&#x27;s now retired. As for Trident, with a 11,000km range, I think we can put it in the same category when looking at reentry accuracy.<p>In any case, accuracy is gated by navigational accuracy, not so much guidance, as long as your initial aim isn&#x27;t too bad. ICBMs have a 100m CEP because they&#x27;re using inertial navigation all the way. Switch to GPS and you&#x27;ll have no trouble doing better.

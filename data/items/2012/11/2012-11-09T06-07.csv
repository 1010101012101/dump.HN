Most of the models that erred predicted that the 2012 turn out would lean less Democratic than the 2008 turn out model, based on the 2010 mid-term turnouts and a (mis)perceived dampening of enthusiasm among Democrats and increased enthusiasm among Republicans.

For the past 3 years i have worked at a startup that i founded as a CEO and programmer. Ultimately we failed but it still was a superb experience but the long hours and high stress also had alot of negative impacts on my life.<p>I got high blood pressure without noticing it, i gained about 10kg in weight, lost a long term (8 years) relationship and always felt stressed and guilty of not doing enough.
In the end the product didnt find success and i realized that even if i love my work and love to work hard, i dont want to sacrifice my health and life as a yound adult.
Now i go to the gym 4-5 times a week and try to maintain some balance while still working hard and most importantly more efficient. Even in 8 hours of highly focused work you will get alot more done than in grinding it out for 12 hours each day, and with regular exercise you will feel much better and be healthier!
I love working out, not only is my blood pressure in excellent condition again and i feel fitter than ever, but it also gives me something else than my coding work to excel at, which is very important to me.<p>This is just my experience and YMMV, but i learned it the hard way.

The <i>fact</i> that any number of models say the earth will warm is <i>not</i> further proof that these models are correct.<p>I have witnessed attempts to model some really complicated activity.  This is typically done with massive amounts of data, we're talking millions of precise observations per day.  These models are back tested with decades of daily data available.  Most importantly, almost all of these models fail to produce and accurate prediction of the future.<p>Now, these climate scientists, with models that are based on mostly extrapolated data, want me to believe that their models accurately predict the future.  To prove it we just have to wait 50 years to see if their predictions come true...<p>Along the way, they seem to take every opportunity to use current events as further evidence that their models are correct.  If there's a hurricane, then it's GW, if there's an earthquake[1] it's global warming, if it's a cold winter[2] it's global warming.  As if none of these things happened before we started burning coal and oil.<p>Here is how the models can be proved correct though:<p>Produce a single, completely objective method for measuring the earth's temperature using the exact same hardware, locations, and environments.  No recalibrations, no changes to the equipment or its environment at all.  Then take the current measurement, use their models to predict the next 10 years, use the exact same hardware to recalculate that measurement every year for the next 10 years.  Then we'll really see how good these models are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/15972840.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/bigphotos/15972840.h...</a>

b) Use your experience.

This works great on a single subnet, but it's likely to just be treated as broadcast (in the absence of IGMP snooping on the switches).

Setting TTL=1 for multicast traffic is often bad, because it causes the first hop router to have to generate an ICMP time exceeded message. Having to do this lots and lots and lots of times per second can crush some legacy router platforms. Speaking as someone who builds networks just for multicast, we instruct our application developers to always use a large TTL and tell them we will ensure it doesn't go further than it should.

Species is just another word saying ""a lot of people"". I'm sure to some of these people suppressing right of some other people would be very beneficial. So what?<p>>>> The concepts of ""fairness"" and ""equality"", are both fundamental to good societies.<p>People understand very different things when they say ""fairness"" and ""equality"". Some people think it's ""fair"" that somebody can not work a day in his life and still get money, shelter, services, education and many other goods paid by somebody else who works 14 hours a day. Some think it's not. Some think it's not ""fair"" that some people have millions and live in luxury and some have trouble with paying for their basic needs - and others think it's completely ""fair"". 
Same with equality - equality of what? The only way people can be truly equal if they are identical clones living identical lives in identical circumstances. This can not happen. So equality needs to be qualified - what we want to be equal? 
The society can do nothing with these definition - these things mean different things for different people, and always will.

Individual has absolutely no obligation to be ""beneficial"" to other people. Treating people only as resources or sources of benefits for oneself is immoral and such treatment - if you're talking about sociopaths - is usually a sure sign of some pathology in emotional/moral sphere.

If your degree was really the ticket to a ""vibrant middle class"" job you'd be able to pay off your student debt.<p>The reality is not all degrees are created equal, and people should think a little bit before they go $200k into debt for a degree that's going lead to a $40k job.  Granted, 18 year olds aren't very good at this kind of reasoning, but that's what parents are for.<p>On top of that, for a lot of fields a degree from a public university is just as good as one from an Ivy.  Nobody is entitled to a pricy private college education.  Either you go on family money or you think very carefully about how those loans are going to get repaid.",1352441455
4761615,comment,4760781,4760781,1,0,evoxed,,,"--- I typed this up just before getting a call, so apologies for the first-draftiness. I refreshed the page to see if anyone was saying anything similar but I didn't see anything, so I might as well post it. ---<p>I really think they should just skip over the whole maj/minority struggle and work on a more suitable approach. What makes Reddit so special? Each subreddit and its dedicated and often unique community. When reddit was relatively new I avoided it, because on the surface all I saw were fellow tech-hungry teenagers looking for the next big place to gather. Only a few years ago did I stumble on some of the smaller, more interesting subreddits and realize that I could spend my entire time among just a few without ever caring about the rest of 'Reddit' because within those <i>little</i> communities, there was something really cool and fun. Expat living in Japan? There's an r/ for that. Love cartography? There's an r/ for that. Linguist/mathematician/physicist? Plenty of r/s for you, of varying quality and concentration but interesting nonetheless.<p>Sometimes when I'm motivated to learn more about a subject, one of the first things I'll do is check if there is a decent subreddit that's relevant. Lo and behold, r/spicy and r/bonsai now come to my frontpage to shower me with pruning advice, sauce exchanges, and more. Of course, anyone can create a new subreddit if the existing ones aren't interesting enough, moderated poorly, or the subject just doesn't have a home yet. My list of micro-wikis and webpages to set up now has marks for items that would work just as well being a subreddit. But we're talking about revenue here, so let me get to the point.<p><i>Don't just think about Reddit as one big thing, but rather as a world full of lively other things some some tiny, others huge.</i> They can make money without looking heavy-handed or causing too much controversy, as long as they see the users (all of them) as collaborators in that effort. Subreddits already enjoy a certain amount of freedom (of moderation, styling), why not gamify it somehow? For example, most people wouldn't mind if r/pics had real ads, and r/pics is probably one of the most trafficked subreddits around. Those who still don't want the ads can get Reddit Gold. However say r/crypto thought the ads were silly, and wanted them removed. Then they could, for example, buy their way out directly (garnering a few extra features for the local mods) or encourage their own subscribers to get gold, with some percentage reducing the number/location of ads until reaching zero.",1352441453

What does this poor white person have to do with your successful white family?  That whole story is not relevant to this person as an individual.<p>We can see that on a historic scale the entire group of people that can trace back to slavery was more hard done by than others.  But that means nothing to this poor white person.  In fact, he may have suffered oppression by government in some other form.  He may have just shown up during slavery fleeing a war-torn country, or political or religious imprisonment.  Or this government may have falsely imprisoned his grandfather years ago.  On a large scale it's nothing like the systemic oppression of slavery, but the point is, he doesn't feel responsible for any of the other guy's issues.<p>It is well known that the government in the past was in the wrong.  But when it comes down to individuals, it's going to be difficult for someone to accept that a guy living next door scraping by on food stamps gets a boon from the government every month, and they don't, simply because they are white.  I see your point, that the white person's problems are less attributable to the government than the black person's.  But I don't think that this is the way to stamp out racism or even make people feel any better about the past.  I think this is the wrong way to go about fixing things.<p>I think it would be better to make a <i>big deal</i> about government racism and punish it <i>going forward</i> in a very serious way.  I think people will appreciate ongoing work to punish current and future offenders much more than a handout for wrongs past.<p>Also, helping those who are economically challenged based on their economic situation makes more sense than trying to correctly and accurately attribute their economic situation to their race and offenses from decades past.  The government is going to end up helping some poor white people in this case along with helping some poor black people.  I don't think that's a bad thing.<p>Unfortunately, in this scenario some black people aren't going to be helped.  In fact, even some black people who can directly trace their history back to slaves aren't going to get help because they aren't sufficiently poor today.  That's not ideal, but hopefully they would appreciate that going forward, racism is being discouraged and at least some attempts are being made to assist the less fortunate.<p>Obviously there is no silver bullet here, and there will never be complete agreement on how to deal with this.  But I absolutely do not think that continuing to make decisions and policy based on race is the way to show that racism is not okay.  It's a completely toxic way of thinking that needs to be eliminated - especially from government.",1352441044

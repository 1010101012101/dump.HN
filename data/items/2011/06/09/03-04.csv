Naturally, I was really curious about the voracity of the claims, so I did some research. It's actually worth reading the thesis as it's pretty interesting stuff. It's here: <a href=""http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/pdfs/research/super/PhD(Muller).pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/pdfs/research/super/PhD(Mulle...</a><p>The study was, as best I can tell after reading through much of it (a lot not relevant to this discussion), quite limited. The largest number of students considered for any of the experiments: 370. All from one school. Most of the other experiments included far fewer students (fewer than 100).<p>Chapter 9 (additional experiments in chapter 10), and the section on Participants and Design has most of the relevant information. I was particularly fascinated by the decision to remove students from the final result for ""watching more than one multimedia treatment."" I mean I understand why it's important to control for this, but part of the point of KA is to provide additional treatments of information.<p>I am not saying that this in any way invalidates the research, but I also don't think it's fair to say that this is somehow a surefire tested solution that is being handed over. In addition, because the research hasn't been repeated outside of the original setting -- at least I couldn't find it, please correct me here if I'm wrong -- it makes the claim that ""because introducing misconceptions was effective in this study means it must be effective in all science videos"" a pretty serious stretch.<p>I'm all for research. We're doing a lot of it right now with our pilot students/classrooms and existing users. But just because something has been research-tested doesn't mean it's automatically the right thing to implement for KA or its students.",1307591798

2635892,comment,2630867,2635307,2,0,gruseom,,,"I like your phrase ""how that language thinks"". C# doesn't think like Smalltalk, so it's a mistake to write C# code as if it does. ""Uncle"" Bob is not a reliable source here.<p>It's been a while since I've read any of PG's code, so the following may be off-base, but I don't think he has any heritage in the OO-short-method school. In his books, at least, he's usually looking for functions that work like language constructs. The hallmark of such constructs is that they can be composed orthogonally. This is not at all true of the long delegation chains favored by classic OO.<p>As for brutal simplicity - a thousand times yes! But what we're discussing is how do you get it. More precisely, how do you get it at the only level that counts: the whole-program level. Otherwise you're just shifting complexity around, and probably thereby increasing it.<p>Edit: Two addenda. (1) I'm surprised to see PG's code come up in the discussion the way it did, because his writings were probably the thing that cured me of OO, or at least convinced me to check myself into detox. (2) I just had the scary thought that someone might read this discussion and think that I'm arguing against short functions in favor of long ones. God no. I'm arguing in favor of <i>short programs</i> against <i>longer programs</i> that have many more function definitions and interactions. Somebody assure me that was clear.",1307591406

He stressed that they have just recently grown to 8 employees thanks to the recent funding, and that they are doing their best.<p>Their overall vision is one of enabling true mastery of subjects by enabling students to proceed at their own pace, and expand upon on a topic only after mastering the prerequisites (switching from percent knowledge in fixed time to complete knowledge in variable time).\nThe eventual goal is to change the in-class focus from data transmission to social interaction, learning interpersonal skills, communication, leadership, and teamwork.<p>I was sceptical about Khan academy, but I believe that with sufficient funding and attention they will be able to create a curriculum that is at least as good as what the average student gets now, and probably much better.

2635849,comment,2630867,2634565,3,0,gruseom,,,"<i>With longer methods, it becomes more strenuous to say that it obviously has no errors.</i><p>I disagree. The proper comparison is not between one long function and one short one (that's a no-brainer), it's between a long function and a corresponding <i>set of short functions plus all their interactions</i>. Posing the comparison correctly makes the complexity tradeoff look very different. I'm not saying it's obvious, but the prima facie bias goes the other way.<p>There's a shortcut for answering this kind of question that may not be infallible but is very useful: program length. Things that make a program longer tend to increase its complexity. One should hesitate to argue that something which inflates code size is making a program simpler. But that is what the short-methods-OO school does routinely.<p>I don't see why one can't take overall program size as the basic measure of total complexity.<p>Edit: from another comment in this thread I gather that you tend to see interactions between functions as less complicated than code inside functions. Boy, do we look at this differently! If a function can do a single meaningful thing in isolation, of course I'd factor it out (that's almost another no-brainer). Those are what PG calls ""utilities"" in his Lisp books. They're meant for random access. But when functions start to interact with too many other functions in ways that affect application logic, my complexity Geiger counter goes crazy. I'd much rather have those interactions isolated in one place, where nobody else can get random access to them and introduce even more dependencies. As befits a truly different world-view, I'm puzzled as to how you can even hold yours.* It seems like a simple matter of combinatorics.<p>* Doesn't stop the discussion from being delightful though.

I haven't read the whole thing, but I've read enough to know that this particular Zuse-head is bullshitting.<p>I'll list just a couple of errors that would be impossible to make if one had read even <i>most</i> of the book. Wolfram often pedantically reiterates the same points, so keep in mind that these things are hard to miss:<p>1) ""The Principle of Computational Equivalence"" does not state that all-is-computation. It states that whatever 'objective' means we use to quantify computational complexity, we will discover that all computations are either trivial or of equal complexity. I.e. computational complexity (where this is crucially left undefined) ""saturates"" very quickly in the world of natural computations, no matter how you decide to measure complexity.<p>2) SW's discovery of universality among the simplest CAs is not a triviality, because unlike what this guy says, the dovetailer is <i>not</i> a simple program -- it is explicitly set up to be universal (in a manner). Its Turing machine rule number is probably in the trillions or higher. Whereas the surprise is that even amongst the very simplest programs, universality is easy to find.<p>To use an analogy, string theorists would <i>cry with joy</i> if it turned out that there was some small number of ""simplest natural string theories"" and one of them gave us all the known particles of the Standard Model.<p>3) Asymptotically optimal program search, in practice, isn't the way you would hunt for universes, and it is relatively easy to see why (TL;DR for now). Schmidhuber's academic work is of no practical relevance to the chapter on physics, although its cool from a math geek perspective. Same with maximally rational agents.<p>And the main idea here is just Occam's razor, not some arcane formulation of maximum predictive accuracy under a strange universal prior of symbol sequences, as cool as that sounds.<p>4) Wolfram <i>doesn't</i> propose the universe is a discrete CA, although everyone seems to think this. He makes all the obvious points about why it is unlikely to be so, and goes on to propose a graph automata model as being a suitable generalization of space and time.<p>So yeah, don't trust every well written review you read on Amazon.<p>As for not referencing people enough, I have sympathy with this criticism. On the other hand, as the book delves into a million and one different domains, the inquisitive reader would get extremely bogged down if he were to descend into the jargon of each individual field. And you <i>would</i> need to descend into jargon to say anything other than light summarizations of what has come before.<p>But these light summarizations <i>do</i> exist, in the extensive notes. In fact they're often not so light -- for example there is quite an interesting discussion of why the Pressburger arithmetic and the theory of intermediate degrees isn't a contradiction of the principle of computational equivalence.<p>Many times when one first thinks that Wolfram is being simplistic or naive, it turns out that he's gone into a lot more depth in the notes (I assume to avoid getting bogged down in the main text).<p>He really does know his shit.<p>Disclosure: I work on Wolfram|Alpha.

Using Arch is dead easy compared to Debian, Ubuntu, and Slackware (my old favorite).\n* It's vanilla. Arch doesn't mess with upstream code, it contributes to upstream.\n* It's current. Arch has the freshest packages. Partly because of it's vanilla policy. As a startup using the latest tech it's quite foolish to use a distro that bundles old (Admittedly proven) versions of our tools.\n* It's stable (enough). This one is the most disputed but if you pay attention when you `pacman -Syu` it's pretty tough to break a system. I'm running the testing repo on my home workstation and laptop because core is too boring.<p>__Some reasons <i>not</i> to use Arch__\n* You have to pay attention. You can't just forget about it for long periods of time.\n* It is currently susceptible to (theoretical) man-in-the-middle attacks on mirror sites. To get around this you could use the Arch Build System (Like Gentoo or ports) and build everything you need from source then use that machine as a local mirror. So if total security is a must just use Gentoo.\n* It moves fast. Don't expect to be running Postgresql 8.4 on here it or anything that isn't the latest release. Major upgrades are announced so everyone sees them but there's no support cycle for old releases. Upgrading individual packages rather than the whole system for long periods of time is haphazard and not sustainable.\n* They're already using Py3k as `/usr/bin/python`. This is part of moving fast but I put it here because it's exceptionally important and upset a lot of Python folks.<p>Sometime in the coming months I am actually preparing a longer form version of this for my blog.

Probably your best bet is to do what Go will do once the patch enneff was referring to is merged: scan conservatively on the stack and precisely on the heap. You can still get false positives and leaks, and you can't do moving GC that way, but it's better than fully conservative GC.<p>By far, the hardest part of GC is precisely marking the stack and registers.

4202019,comment,4201748,4201748,5,0,kaib,,,"This is a really interesting approach to writing graphical user interfaces, if you have written any GUI code ever this is highly recommended reading. The differences are subtle but extremely important. Here is a simple example that both renders a button and tests if it has been clicked:<p>if button(""label"", 100, 100) {
   buttonAction();
 }<p>There are two main benefits to IMGUI's. First, you don't need to package your data from whatever store it is into some GUI widget format. The canonical example is a long list or any other data intensive format that you want the user to be able to explore. In a classical GUI there is a lot of data packing and unpacking to be done to handle this.<p>The second benefit is that your UI's can be much more dynamic and reactive. Because rendering can be nested inside conditional statements and similar it's easy to create bespoke details easily that would be very hard with a traditional GUI framework.<p>The main limitation with IMGUI's is that they are easier to implement on a system that has pretty constant screen refresh and where you can control the pixels on the screen directly. It <i>is</i> possible to implement an IMGUI on top of a classical GUI framework but that is usually not worth the effort, the classical framework will kill most of the benefits of IMGUI.<p>A second word of warning is that while IMGUI's tend to result in 40-50% less code that code will be more intensive. This is definitely a technique you want to utilize when you need to hit those high notes and create something world changing.<p>For a concrete example of IMGUI's in the wild take a look at the editor at <a href=""http://tinkercad.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinkercad.com</a>. The whole user interface is done as an IMGUI system which is a big reason why we have been able to create things like our unique manipulation widget.",1341470705

They've always been pervasive, but I can remember at least as far back as the late DOS/Win 3.11 era, and I can't recall any point in that span where they've been a ""cool"" brand. The Xbox is about the closest thing I can think of, but that's always felt like some weird thing Microsoft did that happened to work out cool than anything that defined Microsoft as a brand.<p>They're nowhere near as bad today as the mid-late 90s when every story about Microsoft on Slashdot was accompanied by a photoshopped borgified Bill Gates, but they really could use a shot in the arm branding wise. The Metro stuff they're doing now is distinctive, but there isn't really any driving philosophy to the marketing at this point. I think the linked article does a great job of providing it that.<p>That said, many of Microsoft's problems have as much to do with management as anything. I'm pretty much convinced they're going to continue to flounder as long as Ballmer remains CEO.

4201926,comment,4199808,4201778,3,0,AYBABTME,,,"I understand your point of view.  Here's my insight on this.<p>French is my mother tongue, and I was quite good at it a few years ago.  I thought that people misusing words or making blatant grammar errors were careless and demonstrated an absence of perfectionism.  Then I started to work and study in English.  Since then, my level of English has greatly improved, but my mastery of French syntax and grammar intricacies is decreasing.  In fact, I noticed that I tend to forget much of the edge cases of French.  Sometime I write a text in French and get to feel bad while re-reading it, knowing I used to have a much better style and grammar.<p>Of course, I could dedicate a greater part of my time to nurturing my study of both languages details.  But natural languages intricacies are too often irrationals, or too far stretching for the added value they bring.  Thus I have a hard time finding the passion to go in their details, master them and use them.  I don't mean I won't investigate them when I first encounter them; I will out of curiosity, but I won't give them as much importance.<p>Now, I got to start learning a third language, which is fundamentally different from French and English: Vietnamese.  As I study it, I find further less reasons to concentrate on each languages edge cases.  I understand the beauty of using a language to its full extent.  But I do not intend to be a master of any specific language, I intend on communicating ideas in the three languages.  I prefer being a master at communicating using languages, than being a master at communicating in one language. As long as I am able to communicate any idea of any complexity, I'll be fine.<p>Maybe it's a sad use of the Art of Languages, using only their generic components.  But I feel my brain can only hold <i></i>this much<i></i> by-hearth-illogical-details, and there are only so few minutes left in my life, I have to make good use of each one.<p>So now, my perspective on language comes to be that my ability to communicate with 90% correctness with as many people as possible is more important than my ability to be correct 100% of the time in a single language.<p>It's quite similar to my view on programming languages.  They come and they go: concentrating on a single one, learning and exploiting its intricacies seems inefficient to the bigger picture, and more error prone when working with other people who might not understand my use of little known features.  Knowing to effectively convey meaning in many languages seems more useful.  Not that I wish to be ""jack-of-all trades, master of none""; just that I think I can be a master at languages, without being master of a language.<p>So to sum it up, I used to think mastery of a language was a symbol of perfectionism.  Then I got to feel that only so many details about a language are useful in 99% of the cases.  Then my recent experience at learning a third language further comforted this opinion.  And when I look back at my friends who write perfect French but have little energy left to learn other languages, I feel sorry for them as they are putting themselves in cages.<p>Thus, I think one can have an easy time programming even though they do not master the intricacies of a single natural language. =)",1341468582

What I find strange about the lcd-touch-panel version is why everyone wants to use it?  I thought skeuomorphic design was something that everyone but apple was actively avoiding.<p>I think I actually prefer the version where you draw a 2D pattern on a grid of numbers, or a picture... although this may also be covered by the patent. Hate patents.",1341468313

The thing is, the complexity of reality is far far more awesome than that and making simplistic sounding plausible evolutionary arguments for certain behaviours is just hubris.  Yes, evolution is happening but we're really overestimating ourselves if we think we know just how it's happening in the absence of archaeological fossil evidence.",1341468277
4201912,comment,4201654,4201654,7,0,cageface,,,"Even taken with a large grain of salt as the TIOBE rankings must be, this is unfortunate since Obj-C is a pretty poor language, IMO.<p>After a year of working almost exclusively in Obj-C I still haven't come to enjoy its verbosity and awkward and incomplete collection classes. The lack of namespaces and inadvertent selector overloading are a regular nuisance. And the Cocoa frameworks are more dynamic than they need to be and heavy use of notifications and KVO make code a rat's nest of indirect jumps that are very hard to follow.<p>It's ok as a widget glue language, I suppose, but really a lot of other languages could serve that purpose just as well without standing over the flaming pit of C all the time.<p>The new collection literals and operator overloads for the collection classes will help, of course. And you have to give Cox some credit for a design that was, in its time, quite visionary. But language design has caught up to and passed Obj-C by in the meantime. If it weren't for my reservations about having one more software layer between me and the machine I would have moved to MonoTouch/C# a long time ago.",1341468265

The other elephant in the room is tech culture that readily accepts copycats or competitors that aim for a proven market to cash in on me-too success with no intention to improve the idea and move technology forward.<p>Patents are supposed to discourage this. Steve Jobs probably agreed with the principle that you should aim to innovate, not merely make money.<p>Of course the problem is the legal system is ill suited to perform what is really an economic incentive. All these trials about silly details like straight edges and slide to unlock comically miss the bigger picture, but they're the only current avenue.",1341468181

After you see and use something it's always easier to find <i>this said solution</i>. BUT before Apple it seems that none of the 100 engineers you mentioned came up with the idea and it was never build and that means it was never obvious before Apple created it.<p>Saying things are obvious after someone already <i>invented</i> a dead simple and good solution for a problem we had for years is always easy.<p>EDIT: Grammer.",1341468179

Better yet, they were going to backdoor this in via an automatic update most users wouldn't see onto a physical device the users paid for.

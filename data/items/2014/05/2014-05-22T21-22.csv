I guess they are doing the same.<p>Once you&#x27;re done with the diagonals: fill the line which is most close to completed.

There&#x27;s nothing magical about our level of consciousness; as unintuitive as that may be. Aaronson argues that the model must yield to our intuition, but if the model is consistent and explains our observations, our intuition should yield to it. - the obvious analog here being quantum mechanics<p>In regards to saying &quot;both that the Hard Problem is meaningless, and that progress in neuroscience will soon solve the problem if it hasn’t already,&quot; neuroscientists and mathematicians too often overlook the Turing test here.

The benefits are proven.<p>But where did you get the notion that washing the whole body with soap is beneficial or even benign? You&#x27;ve cited many studies, but they all deal with aging and not with skin flora.<p>Skin flora is complex. I know of no scientific study that has looked into whether skin flora or hygiene is improved by full body soap washing.<p>Full body soap washing began in the early part of the 20th century, following a steady marketing campaign with ads such as this:<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1yyuz0p6ybhby3/Soap%20Ad.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1yyuz0p6ybhby3/Soap%20Ad.jpg</a><p>At the time, people bathed little. When they bath more frequently, with soap, odour improved. Soap usage became widespread.<p>It seemed a reasonable inference that soap was the cause. Particularly since if you stop using soap, you get smellier, even if you bathe.<p>I believe this inference is wrong. I stopped using soap in 2011. For the first 2-3 weeks, I smelled worse. Then I smelled better. I have had practically no BO since, even in the most sensitive regions. Women have confirmed that I smell good, spontaneously. If you saw me, you would never know I don&#x27;t use soap.<p>I&#x27;m using an N of 1, but it seemed like the bacterial balance of my skin improved. It also became less oily. I can only speak to my own example, but I have seen many reports from others who went through the same transition as me.<p>So I&#x27;ll repeat: where is your evidence that <i>full-body</i> soap washing offers benefits? Are there any scientific studies that support your position?<p>My hypothesis is that full body soap makes us worse off and that we don&#x27;t realize this due to the transition period. Our habit was begun by marketing and cemented by tradition. (our parents washed us when we were young)<p>Edit: I just noticed this sentence:<p>&quot;There is no evidence whatever that there are any large number of bacterial species or other microorganisms that are actively &quot;beneficial&quot; for human beings&quot;<p>This seems rather unsupported.

They don&#x27;t target &quot;bad organisms&quot; - there really aren&#x27;t bad organisms. Monocultures are bad because they have no competitors. A mixed-ecology where you have several or many species which do compete usually inhibits the ability of any 1 type to take over successfully.<p>Of course, this is all happening on the surface of your skin, and how stable is that environment anyway? History says not very - and on top of that pretty much all of these things are really nasty if they successfully get <i>under</i> the skin.<p>One successful way to treat IBS-like symptoms for example is to take a course of antibiotics which are known to be mild - that is, they tend to have a balancing effect on the gut&#x27;s fauna. I can personally attest this makes all the difference in the world.<p>Conversely, it&#x27;s not at all clear that probiotics do <i>anything</i> - for reasons similar to the above. In a crowded environment, they can&#x27;t easily take over, and bacteria are all about film-forming and quorum sensing and the like - isolated cells are much less active.<p>On top of those issues, there&#x27;s a scale one. Humans basically regard about 150-500 people as being actual human beings like them (Dunbar&#x27;s number). Historically we tribalized on that sort of scale but almost every culture started to use various scents or cleansing practices when they built larger and larger groupings. Sure, maybe we can get by with intact surface cultures, but can we get along? The human nose is <i>important</i>. Try being in a room with someone who has a bad smelling odour - the urge to simply leave is powerful. The urge to try and wash it off is powerful. Its not clear that we&#x27;d be at all tolerant of people who smelt sufficiently different - and I suspect that&#x27;s why we standardized on a zero which we can all achieve.",1400794197

7786650,comment,7784288,7784288,5,0,tokenadult,,,"The author of the story kindly submitted here begins by writing, &quot;I was Subject 26 in testing a living bacterial skin tonic, developed by AOBiome, a biotech start-up in Cambridge, Mass. The tonic looks, feels and tastes like water, but each spray bottle of AO+ Refreshing Cosmetic Mist contains billions of cultivated Nitrosomonas eutropha, an ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) that is most commonly found in dirt and untreated water. AOBiome scientists hypothesize that it once lived happily on us too — before we started washing it away with soap and shampoo.&quot; So what we are particularly talking about here is an early-phase human trial of a cosmetic product (which is regulated in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food, Drugs, and Cosmetics Act) which may or may not have the benefits claimed by the manufacturer. The trial is to find out if the new cosmetic does anything at all beneficial, without too much harm. Getting news coverage like this is of course public relations gold for the manufacturer.<p>I read most of the comments here before reading the article and then posting my later comment. A lot of the comments revolve around the issue of the health effects of &quot;modern&quot; human life. All epidemiological evidence to date suggests that living like a middle-class or wealthier person from a developed country is good for health. An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why.&quot;[1] refers to the steady long-term upward trend in healthy lifespan in the United States. Whatever we are doing about washing our bodies or our hair so far doesn&#x27;t have any harmful effect that isn&#x27;t swamped by the generally helpful effect of all the other changes of modern life. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the developed countries of the world.[2] The overall trends are so favorable to further improvement to general health that if the observed facts about people who are already born and conservatively projected current trends continue, we can expect that girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot;[3] by James Vaupel, originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[4]<p>On evolutionary grounds, there is every reason to expect that human beings have haphazard adaptations through natural selection to survive to reproductive age despite a world full of microorganisms that were neither created nor evolved to benefit human beings, but rather just to survive and reproduce themselves. There is no evidence whatever that there are any large number of bacterial species or other microorganisms that are actively &quot;beneficial&quot; for human beings, rather than simply being well tolerated by human hosts. To live to healthy old age and greater enjoyment of the natural world and all its wonders, human beings may very well be better off continuing the human way of shaping their environments and culturally transmitting environmental interventions that lead to &quot;unnaturally&quot; good health and longevity.<p>AFTER EDIT, TO RESPOND TO QUESTION BELOW: Yes, I am saying there is weak or no evidence of &quot;beneficial&quot; bacteria for human beings. This is to be expected from the consilient findings of evolutionary theory. (Human beings have had to live in highly microbe-free environments, for various reasons.) I am specifically asking for evidence, from medical review articles, that there are well accepted &quot;beneficial&quot; skin microbes. Which are they? What is the evidence that shows the benefit?<p>The author of the article seems somewhat convinced by her personally experienced anecdote. It would of course take much more long-term study (not to mention more double-blind study designs) before we will be sure what is beneficial for human skin in particular and human health in general by way of applying bacteria intentionally to our skins. Suffice it to say that I am not afraid of washing my hands with soap nor afraid of washing my hair with shampoo. The book <i>The Checklist Manifesto</i> reports on an experimental study in a poor country of promoting hand-washing with soap, and how that showed evidence of improving health outcomes. Let&#x27;s not throw out good hygiene with the bath water until more research has been completed on this interesting topic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[4] \n<a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a>",1400793875

No one noticed I stopped using either.<p>I can only speak for myself, but I still use soap after using the washroom and when handling food.<p>There&#x27;s pretty clear scientific evidence for the use of hand-washing in specific cases. I think most of the people trying the no-soap, no-shampoo thing are actually rather empirical and respectful of science.<p>I used to work on repairing old newspapers in an archives. I saw the old ad campaigns for soap. We originally started using soap due to marketing, not due to scientific studies.<p>At the time, people didn&#x27;t bathe that much. Ads recommended bathing regularly with soap. This improved odour. People fell for a correlation and thought it was soap that was the cause. This knowledge &quot;wash yourself with soap!&quot; was handed down through successive generations.<p>This belief was strengthened due to a TEMPORARY increase in BO if you stop using soap, once started. Takes about 1-4 weeks before the body adjusts and you become LESS smelly than you were before. Few people would have tried going without soap that long, so naive empiricism backed up marketing and tradition.<p>In other words, our current &quot;soap everywhere, every day!&quot; habits were not formed due to empirical inquiry and scientific study.<p>Here&#x27;s one of the soap ads.

It stinks that they have to do so.<p>That&#x27;s true, but it&#x27;s also life in general, I&#x27;ll explain what I mean.<p>I&#x27;m an agnostic who tends towards atheism with a very specific policy.  I will not lie to people about my religious views, but I will let them make assumptions.  Many people assume I&#x27;m Christian and I never disabuse them of that notion.  The reason is simple:  For me, the issue isn&#x27;t important.  I believe more in people than ideologies.  For them, it is important, so let them have their comfort.  Their beliefs do not offend me, and I defend their right to have them without harassment (I dislike Atheism in general even though I tend towards that thought process).<p>In all my years, I&#x27;ve only ever had a single person ask me straight out if I was Christian (in a work environment).  I was working through an outsourcing company, and a week later they were asked to replace me with someone else.  In essence I was &quot;fired&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s was unfair, and it was crap.  I doubt you&#x27;ll find many people who will disagree with you.  Could it truly have been a coincidence?  Possibly, but I find the likelihood of it very doubtful.<p>I took it as just more bullshit that&#x27;s happened.  I didn&#x27;t get particularly offended by it, I certainly didn&#x27;t start painting everyone with the brush that I&#x27;m a victim and they&#x27;re terrible.<p>people are shit sometimes, you just move on.  You deal with your own shit.<p>This is all to say that I <i>understand</i> their point of view, and this is one of the reasons why I reject them in general.<p>To bring it back on topic, it is tough, and maybe it is unfair.  But woman have a right to an opportunity, they do not have a right to no bullshit.  Someone making unwanted sexual advances isn&#x27;t a problem.  Someone doing it after it&#x27;s been made clear they&#x27;re unwanted is.  Someone playing grabass is absolutely a problem that needs to be dealt with immediately.<p>However, someone dismissing an opinion because they have a bias against women is not something they need to be crusading against, and the reason is quite simple:  I&#x27;ve had my opinion dismissed for being male (by them), for being a software developer (by business people), for political reasons (I&#x27;m a freelance software dev... I&#x27;m sure you can imagine).<p>There are shit environments no matter who you are, what you believe, or what you look like.  But you deal with them and move on because that&#x27;s life, it isn&#x27;t perfect, and you do not have a right to everyone being perfectly fair to you.<p>This is a separate issue from why women do not join our industry, but it gets conflated.  We do not have a problem with women entering our industry and then leaving (anymore than men).  We have a problem with women not entering at all.<p>They hurt themselves by conflating the two, and causing many people (like me) to stop listening to them.  At the end of the day, we have to deal with shit too, and when they put themselves on the list of shit we have to deal with, we have a tendency to simply move on.  We cannot emotionally engage, because we&#x27;ll get angry.<p>If they want us to emotionally engage, they need to approach it differently.",1400793763

I use it to access the files from my Mac, Win 7 PC and iPad. Two days ago, I got a notification on my Mac indicating a new update for Box Sync was available. I executed it. After the update, it gave a notification that files were being migrated to a new folder and I should &#x27;not use Box Sync&#x27; during the migration. I left my MacBook alone but noticed that Box was doing a Sync. After a while I returned. There was a new &#x27;Box Sync&#x27; folder. I started working. Upon trying to open a file, I found it missing from the sub-folder in the Box Sync folder. I had worked for hours on this doc the night before. After several painful minutes of panic, I found that there was another new folder &#x27;Box Sync backup (not synced). This had 216 files in multiple folders in it. Luckily, including the file I had been working on.<p>My entire set Box folders is a mess. I did the update on my Mac, here I have 200+ files off to another folder tree.

This is not only true for files I edited the night before, but files I have not touched for days.<p>I files ticket immediately with Box. It is over 30 hours and I have no response from them.

I have no confidence when I edit a file on my PC that I was working on the latest version and it will sync back to my Mac.<p>Anyone else suffer this fate? Is there any guidance on how to resolve it?

I love this stuff.<p>So my understanding of FHE is that it can take an arbitrary circuit (any arbitrary program) and convert it into a circuit which operates on encrypted data.<p>That means it must be possible to write the equivalent of<p><pre><code>  if (op == OP_ADD) { /* interpret addition bytecode */ }\n  else if (op == OB_MUL) { /* interpret multiplication bytecode */ }\n  ...\n</code></pre>\netc, where &quot;op&quot; is encrypted data.  By extension, you can write an entire interpreter for encrypted bytecodes.<p>Now, when the program executes, it&#x27;s obviously possible to monitor it and watch what&#x27;s being done.  However, <i>until</i> it executes, the bytecode remains secret.  That means it should be possible to ship programs which are impossible to analyze until they&#x27;re actually executed.<p>It&#x27;s a common malware technique to write a program which contains an encrypted subprogram, which is only decryptable on a certain target machine.  (For example, you could use a specific computer&#x27;s MAC address as an ecryption key, which means no reverse engineer can analyze it except on that specific machine.)<p>FHE, on the other hand, provides the opportunity to ship a turing-complete interpreter to everyone, which executes encrypted bytecodes which can&#x27;t be analyzed until execution time.  That means a FHE program could be a timebomb set to wipe your harddrive at some specific date and you wouldn&#x27;t know it, since the best you could determine beforehand is &quot;this interpreter sometimes tries to execute shell commands&quot; without actually seeing which commands it&#x27;s capable of executing in practice until it&#x27;s too late.",1400793490

Weird and disturbing. Weird because I&#x27;d expect such an organization to be gravitating towards big industrial nations&#x27; interests if we&#x27;re to assume that they are susceptible to lobbying - not the other way around. Disturbing because if they are doing politics rather than science then we have a different kind of problem which is that the bodies of experts that we should be trusting on very complex subjects are not to be trusted and I don&#x27;t know where that leaves us as a society.<p>I&#x27;ll accept the point of not putting forward very well researched links but to my defence:\n1. Climatology is far from my expertise. As is microbiology, or nuclear power or space exploration. And that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m ok with paying people (from my taxes) to have an educated opinion on such matters.\n2. as you probably know it&#x27;s quite difficult to find who are the generally respectful scientists (remember dismissing a whole lot of them just a while ago (IPCC)).\n3. I -sorry about that- thought that we&#x27;re past scepticism on the subject as I have only seen that attitude only in conspiracy theorists (right or left leaning).\n4. I pitted the problem as a problem that can (or at least should) be solved in the same way that humans have been improving their lives - with ingenuity and a mind for the society as a whole.<p>Anyway - thank you for your long and researched answer and I sincerely hope that Landsea is right because I don&#x27;t believe that we&#x27;re about to change anything in our ways any time soon.",1400793121

Some prefer simple and not having to think and some prefer tweaking, suprises and flexibility. If I had said &quot;stupid&quot; iOS users then it would be an insult.<p>1) No his complaint isn&#x27;t valid. There are sensible defaults - it only becomes a choice if you install another app that does the same things. In this case Gallery is built in and Google Photos is well Google&#x27;s. It&#x27;s not as if every app has a choice on launch. And how exactly are you going to solve the problem of user not having tried one or the other if the user isn&#x27;t willing to choose one? Throw him a training video for both apps? That sounds even worse.<p>3) The whole idea of Android is different things for different people. You don&#x27;t go buy an $699 unlocked phone and use it as a Specifically Optimized for Carrier X phone. It is an unlocked phone designed to run on many carriers as possible. If you need to download an app or two for further customization that&#x27;s not really a big problem. If it is, then you should&#x27;ve bought something from T-Mobile store that they&#x27;ve customized for you. Wanting it both ways while pretending to be a simpleton user doesn&#x27;t warrant any discussion.<p>4) If you need a certain type of lock screen and aren&#x27;t willing to install one - you should at least look at the phones in a retail store and pick the one with the right lock screen - you can find a lot I bet. Complaining about HTC having confusing lock screen is contradictory to entire point of how Android works.<p>5) Yeah, sure - but at least it works.

It&#x27;s as normal as breathing air and eating food. Your mother colonizes you with bacteria at birth and through feeding. Our foods help us build immunities. Our friends and being outside and playing and working and everything we do exposes us to bacteria. Being exposed to bacteria isn&#x27;t evil or wrong. Being weak to bacterial exposure is like being weak to sunlight-- it is going to dramatically change your life and make you very &quot;abnormal&quot; as a human. That&#x27;s not our fault.<p>&quot;Soap and water have saved more lives than any medication, ever.&quot;<p>Proper hygiene has saved those lives, of which soap and water played a role.

Just because someone wants to be healthy doesn&#x27;t mean you have a right to accuse them of attacking you. If you&#x27;re that sensitive, you need to protect yourself with heavy isolation.

IANA (ICANN) and the RIRs then worked to recover some blocks of unused IPv4 addresses.  These became the &quot;recovered IPv4 pool&quot; and the agreement was that allocations from this pool would begin once one of the RIRs reached the last /9 of their available IPv4 address space.<p>LACNIC hit that mark and triggered ICANN&#x27;s policy to start allocating out of this recovered address space pool.  The NRO has an announcement up about this, too:<p><a href=""http://www.nro.net/news/iana-allocates-recovered-ipv4-addresses-to-rirs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nro.net/news/iana-allocates-recovered-ipv4-addres...</a><p>Basically, after this recovered pool of IPv4 addresses is allocated by IANA, there aren&#x27;t any more IPv4 addresses to give out.",1400792599
7786520,comment,7785681,7786279,2,0,bdcs,,,"To underscore your point, there was recently a speed test[1] conducted to compare the Moto E (~vanilla android, 120$ unlocked) vs Samsung Galaxy S5 (TouchWiz, ~700$ unlocked) in user tests (think Google+ load times, not MIPS). The Moto E was faster, despite having roughly 1/3rd the hardware metrics.<p>Hardware vendors and carriers are to blame for a lot of this UX disaster (e.g., including their own superfluous app, causing the Intents Dialog confusion on day 1 rather than popping up after you choose to install a new app for X). Is Google to blame for not doing a better job of controlling fragmentation? In my opinion, in the past, no. Android might not have taken off without the freedom given to manufactures/carriers. In the future, Google DOES need to wrangle this crapware problem (I think of it as crap icing on a delicious vanilla cake). Google is doing exactly this with Android Silver [2].<p>Finally, what does Android do wrong? Well, just look at CyanogenMOD&#x27;s features to see what Android is lacking: privacy and app permissions, data limiting (ads), firewalls, etc.<p>[1]<a href=""http://phandroid.com/2014/05/19/samsung-galaxy-s5-vs-motorola-moto-e-video/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phandroid.com/2014/05/19/samsung-galaxy-s5-vs-motorol...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/android-silver-launch-date-2014-5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/android-silver-launch-date-20...</a>",1400792592

This is all me having fun speculating.<p>I think you&#x27;re being too handwavy about what FHE is capable of. FHE means that specific operations performed on encrypted data result in data that, when decrypted, have the right result in cleartext. It&#x27;s not &quot;hiding the data&quot;. So it can&#x27;t run your encrypted bytecode, only transform it into other, also encrypted bytecode, which it also can&#x27;t interpret. Executing encrypted bytecode doesn&#x27;t really make sense, because the bytecode tells its interpreter what to do. Either the interpreter can read that information and do it, or it can&#x27;t. The former means its not encrypted in the first place, and the latter means it won&#x27;t work. You&#x27;re trying to use a scheme by which the interpreter doesn&#x27;t how to evaluate a function, but evaluates it correctly anyway.",1400792420

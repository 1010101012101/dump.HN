Arrays are no longer objects?  An &#x27;each&#x27; function that uses it&#x27;s own way of combining what countless languages before you have split into &#x27;map&#x27;, &#x27;filter&#x27; and &#x27;each&#x27; functions?  Etc etc.<p>I&#x27;m going to hazard a guess that your work has been predominately if not exclusively as a solo dev.  This is effectively your personal utility library.  That&#x27;s cool.  The problem is that virtually all software eventually ends up being a team effort, if nothing else than by the guy/gal who has to work on it after you.  You may not like how JS does some things (like zero-indexing), but that guy already knows JS, he doesn&#x27;t know your library.  By revamping core semantics of JS, you&#x27;re forcing him to learn your opinions.  Are you so sure of your opinions that you can confidently say it&#x27;s worth everyone else undergoing that effort?  Are your opinions really so important as to break compatibility with every other piece of JS?<p>I gather from your comments that you intend this library as the base of a larger project.  I&#x27;d encourage you to base that project on more widely known foundations -- pick your favorite module system, and use underscore.js or one of the other widely vetted and tested utility libraries.",1377111565

When the simulation resumes, the glitch is gone before we can scientifically investigate the reported paranormal event.<p>The obvious question is then why don&#x27;t they also adjust our memories before resuming the simulation, so that nobody remembers seeing the ghost? One possibility is that they don&#x27;t know how to.<p>We can see a similar thing in machine learning. If you trained a big neural net to, say, do word classification, you almost certainly would not be able to go in and tweak in a predictable way how it classifies a specific word by fiddling with the weights by hand.<p>Limitations on the developers&#x27; ability to tweak our memories could also explain much of myth and legend. Maybe so many cultures have old stories of dragons because there were really dragons in the simulation. When the developers removed dragons, they could take out the physical evidence (the dragons themselves, dragon remains and fossils), but not our memories, and so dragons became beings of myth as those with first hand knowledge of them died off and their descendants did not believe the stories.",1377110708

6252438,comment,6250431,6251963,3,0,throwaway9848,,,"Let&#x27;s examine typical examples of authoritarianism: Stalin, Pol Pot, Pinochet, Franco, to name a few.  Note these are people, not nations, yet they they instantaneously identifiable with the USSR, Cambodia, Chile, and Spain.  This is a key aspect of authoritarianism - the origin of laws and their enforcement are from a person or cabal, not from the people of that nation.  Dictatorship is not synonymous with authoritarianism, but they have a large overlap.<p>All of my examples are universally considered extremely immoral.  However, there are also some countries that are mostly authoritarian, but are arguably not immoral (some middle eastern sultanates come to mind).  There is an enormous body of though on the morality of laws.  This starts in Greek time with Plato and The Republic, and has had contributions from Aquinas, Hobbes, and more recently MLK.  A non-authoritarian state can easily pass immoral laws, too.<p>Finally, the degree of enforcement of law is a concept which I consider separate from the system of government and the particular laws of the society.<p>So my objection is that the post commingled three separate ideas:  the origin of law within a society, the morality of law, and the rigor of law enforcement.  I think the commingling was incorrect.  I think some of this is so obvious that not recognizing it can be fairly characterized as stupid.  Hope that I hope that clarifies things.<p>To offer my opinion, the US is not close to being an authoritarian state.  However, it has some immoral laws.  That can be rectified via a democratic process.  I think the enforcement of those laws in this case was actually fairly lax, because he clearly committed crimes and it would not have been difficult to have made a case for treason which would have been eligible for capital punishment, as another commenter noted.",1377110423

6252436,comment,6251087,6251652,4,0,Bluestrike2,,,"Tangential, but you hit on a really fascinating field in psychology with your post.<p>We have these differences--linguistic, cultural, even physical characteristics--that are huge. The differences that highlight a lack of shared background/experiences/origin/etc. can be found not only to be at play between, say, native and non-native speakers of a language but even separate groups within the same culture. You see that in how we handle subjective feelings of personal space, for instance --we Americans, for instance, tend to prefer greater personal space over say Scandinavian or certain East Asian cultures. But the fascinating thing is how those expectations can shift based on region, and on an even more micro level, affluence etc.<p>Even when the differences are minor, such as say race and skin color, the effects can be profound. If you look into what&#x27;s called the cross-race effect, you&#x27;ll find a tendency to have difficulty processing faces of members of other groups. If you&#x27;ve ever heard anyone say &quot;all Asians look alike&quot; or the similar &quot;all Westerners look alike&quot;, this effect is what&#x27;s behind that sentiment. And it&#x27;s universal: this processing difficulty isn&#x27;t limited to any particular ethnic group. Cross-racial identification statistics for eyewitnesses prove all too well just how troubling this can be even amongst ethnic groups that are otherwise readily familiar (i.e. whites identifying blacks and vice versa). But what a lot of the current literature shows is that the rate of difficulty can decrease with familiarity that shapes how we code faces and integrate them into<p>Anyhow, as far as communication is concerned, it&#x27;s not just verbal. On the contrary, most of our cues are distinctly non-verbal: body language, gestures, expressions, prosody, paralanguage, and a lot more. People toss around Albert Mehrabian&#x27;s &quot;93%&quot; number a lot without considering its context (namely, his work was limited to the communication of feelings and attitudes), but the broader point is that these cues serve as a means of helping to imply meaning to the words they accompany.<p>Now, where the really fun stuff begins is when you start to consider the universality of some of these nonverbal cues. Particularly with the face with microexpressions: involuntary expressions lasting only a tiny fraction of a second that correspond to six basic emotions. Contrary to the idea that expressions and meaning were culturally determinate, the research is fairly overwhelming that despite differences in culture, language, and even physical face characteristics, microexpressions and the emotions represented are consistent. Rules governing those emotions are be culturally specific, but how they&#x27;re expressed and the emotions themselves aren&#x27;t. Back in &#x27;71, Ekman went to the Papua New Guinea to show this with the Fore people even though they had almost no direct contact with the outside world up until the fifties, and at the time Ekman went, had no access to Western media or entertainment that might have given the Fore the experience with outsiders and their facial expressions.<p>Related to your post, however, are the findings that show we&#x27;re able to recognize these expressions by people outside our own ethnic groups. In a sense, not only are the emotions and expressions universal but so too are our ability to recognize them. Biologically determined, hardwired. So talking in person, rather than on the phone, can make all the difference in the world.<p>If you&#x27;re curious, I&#x27;d recommend taking a look at a reprint of Ekman&#x27;s <i>Unmasking the Face</i> and <i>Darwin and Facial Expression: A Century of Research in Review</i> if you&#x27;re curious about some of the historical origins of the work. The latter, in particular, is truly fascinating.",1377110376

The correct way to solve this for everyone involved is to reduce the amount of stress everyone is under in a meeting and to create an environment conducive to problem solving. This isn&#x27;t really that hard, a well motivated employee whose rewards and goals align with the company will try his best to create value as it helps him the most as well. If an employee is very bad at meetings, he could also be asked to express his ideas beforehand to someone he feels comfortable with and then that person could help him express his idea in the meeting.<p>The solution of hiring only people who can shout the loudest and brute force their ideas through in combative meetings is not a solution that will create value over the long term. If someone is breaking down in your meeting the problem is the meeting, not the person. Fix the meeting. Even people capable of taking stress is meetings will still perform better if that stress is removed.<p>EDIT: You also shouldn&#x27;t be making snap judgements in a meeting that will affect the future of the company in the market.

Since an &#x27;outside&#x27; universe doesn&#x27;t need to bear any relation to our &#x27;inside&#x27; universe, it can be vastly simpler. Maybe it&#x27;s a rule 110 cellular automaton; maybe it&#x27;s a 2,3 turing machine; maybe its an iota evaluator; it could even be just some abstract computational essence, distinct from implementation. That&#x27;s enough to run a simulation.<p>Now, the question is &#x27;why simulate the universe when you could just simulate a brain&#x27;? This is basically the Boltzmann Brain argument. In terms of bits (see Kolmogorov complexity) the universe is simpler to describe (physics + initial conditions) than a whole brain (neurons, synapses, hormones, etc.). Basically, the universe can unfold from a tiny core (the big bang), whereas a single brain can&#x27;t (it could unfold from a fertilised egg, but that&#x27;s already huge, and requires all kinds of matter and physics to work which the big bang would have used anyway). In that case, a random program running on an &#x27;outside&#x27; computer is much more likely to be a universe than a brain. By the anthropic principle, we could ask if our universe is the simplest which can support life, in terms of the number of bits required to encode the laws of physics as a program.",1377109468

We cherish recommendations from current or past employees, but we&#x27;ll also open the position to all on the off chance we get a good application through traditional routes. HR only becomes involved with the process after an offer has been accepted or if the hiring manager has questions/concerns.<p>After an informal lunch with the hiring manager, you&#x27;ll be invited to meet with some senior developers for about an hour. These meetings are mostly to figure out what the candidate thinks their strengths and weaknesses are and gives us a chance to talk about the stuff we plan to work on in the near and not-so-near future.<p>Once we have a fairly basic understanding of each other, we&#x27;ll come up with a project.

There even exist situations (in the case of some positions) where you will be talking to a client of the company you&#x27;re working for, effectively interviewing with the client, representing the company. And interviewing is a subset of &quot;sales&quot;, which is important for working on many teams -- including selling management on changes that would improve the user experience, for example.<p>>Meetings and code reviews are with co-workers, whom you know and trust.<p>Actually, when you first start out, you don&#x27;t know them much more than you did when they were interviewing you. And honestly, I haven&#x27;t always learned to trust my coworkers; or rather, some I&#x27;ve learned to not trust.<p>Regardless, this sounds like a psychological limitation on the side of the interviewee. Which is something you can work to improve.<p>Disclaimer: I&#x27;ve always been good at interviews. At least good enough that I have a more than 50% job offer rate for interviews I&#x27;ve gone to.<p>>For my own personal example, I once interviewed at a place where the interviewer wrote up some HTML on a whiteboard, and then asked me to write out the CSS next to it that would turn it into a horizontal drop down menu.<p>Not my domain, but yes, that sounds like a &quot;parrot from memory something that you could copy-and-paste or build up trivially with a real coding environment,&quot; which I agree is not a great question, nor is it a good way to interview.<p>>I opted out of returning for the second round of interviews.<p>I think this is where you failed, though. If they asked you back, then even though you didn&#x27;t feel good about the interview process, you must have passed. Their process is broken, so probably NO ONE was able to do everything perfectly.<p>>The next place I interviewed I sat down, in front of a computer, with the interviewer, and we talked through code as I wrote it. I took the job.<p>That&#x27;s certainly a better interview process. But you do realize that you filtered out a company for having a less-than-optimal interview process?

6252212,comment,6251087,6251087,2,0,windust,,,"In our company we understand that testing up-front can be off-putting, but we rather pass up a great candidate than hiring a poor one (we do subscribe to Polsky view on candidates <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing...</a>). We allow them to test at their pace (codility.com) from home first, then we re-test them on-site (to avoid the &#x27;someone doing my homework&#x27; effect). After that the next interview is pretty much talking on the code written code and approaches or decisions that the candidate took. So in that sense is a great piece to further discussion.<p>The issue is that where I work we can&#x27;t subcontract as a way to &#x27;test&#x27; for candidates. The code is so proprietary, and have so much red tape (Options Trading platform) that we don&#x27;t trust anyone unless you are full-time. Also, the code is fairly complex and embedded in it&#x27;s industry-speak that unless you come from the same industry subset, you will not be productive (like knowing  what Black-scholes,  instrument, or delta means). So the investment to getting any good developer to be able to produce is immense. We considered subcontracting for assessing a candidate, but it is fairly hard.<p>Also we have seen people that do extremely well on every other aspect of the interview but can&#x27;t deliver when asked to write a piece of code. Good or bad it does show your ability to work under pressure (I am not sure if it&#x27;s extreme in the financial industry, but stress levels here run fairly high... for a fun read <a href=""http://codesnipers.com/?q=interview-the-wall-street-programmer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codesnipers.com/?q=interview-the-wall-street-programm...</a>). So when you&#x27;re getting your coffee, someone comes and says &#x27;we need to fix this&#x27; it will probably be as intimidating (or more) as having a code interview.<p>Lastly, maybe because we&#x27;ve seen it often enough, there are a ton of programmers that can&#x27;t write code (yes, the fizzbuzz crew). Having the codility test filter in front of all eliminates a lot of that chaff we see, so we don&#x27;t even bother with the candidates unless they get a good-enough result in codility (we do look at the code, not just if it passes/fails the unit tests, but we don&#x27;t bring the candidate for an actual interview until we have a reasonable expectation that they can program). We understand we will miss Ike Ellis, and we accept that as part of the tradeoffs between time and opportunities.",1377108312

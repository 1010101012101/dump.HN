Anytime you use a wireless network, where you don't have control over the access point, you need to secure everything you want to keep private. This goes for everything from google searches and files transfers to instant messaging and e-mail. The proven solution is to use a VPN tunnel, which even many home routers support nowadays.<p>Of course there's still a bigger problem with arp spoofing and other attacks, which in the long term will need to be solved.

Boost::Python uses complex template meta programming to allow you access to Python objects in C++; you're mostly writing C++. I like how I can see what I'm getting with Cython as opposed to trying to fathom the template metamagic.<p>Back when I used Pyrex my main problem was accidentally using some variable or function that was not C declared and Pyrex silently generating code for that that called into Python, requiring a review of the generated C code -- I think Cython has fixed that so you can see when it turns something like foo(x) into Py_GetTheGlobalVar(""foo"") etc.<p>Anyway, that's a view from a production environment which has used Pyrex for 3-4 years with great success.",1288345387

1846701,comment,1844986,1846280,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"It's not about hardware or particular niches, it's about paradigms and platforms. The Altair wasn't a business device, it was a hobby kit, as was the Apple I. But the PC realm today is not relegated to merely electronics and programming hobbyists. Because the PC as a paradigm and as a platform evolved and grew (flourished one might say) and its fundamental characteristics (lower cost, accessibility and availability for the masses, greater facilitation of innovation, etc.) was the seed for that flourishing. The PC of 1990 or 2010 is orders of magnitude (sagans, in fact) more powerful and capable than its initial forebears, and that's because the PC platform/paradigm was able to evolve much faster than mainframes and mini-computers, and it wasn't saddled with the same limits.<p>Micro-computers enabled the GUI, they enabled personal computers on every work desk and home office. They put into everyone's hands capabilities and tools that were previously the purview of a select few. There are a great many more experts in typography today because of the power of the PC. The same goes for movie makers, photographers, etc.<p>Mobile computing isn't just about smartphones or computing on a handset, it's a platform and a paradigm. It's the appstore + sandbox model. It's more intuitive interfaces (e.g. multi-touch). Etc.<p>If you look at the iPhone or the iPad and say to yourself ""these won't replace Windows"" you will be fooling yourself. This is not a static industry, indeed it's one of the most dynamic, falling back to static conceptions of the world is a recipe for being left behind. You need to imagine what the possibilities are for the future of these paradigms. iOS has been in users' hands for less than 4 years, the appstore has only been around for 2 years. What will iOS and the application landscape look like after it's evolved for 4x or 5x that time? What will android and its applications look like? And Chrome OS? And WebOS? And whatever anyone else comes up with?<p>Apple knows what's up, they're morphing the OS X experience to be more like iOS, they can see a future where the experience of using a Macbook is more like that of using the iPhone, where installing applications over the internet is the rule rather than the exception.<p>Here's a simple hypothetical. Imagine the iPad all grown up, it's faster, it has terabytes of internal solid state storage, it has a larger screen. Plug it into a docking station on a desk and it becomes a monitor with a keyboard and mouse attached and connected to a wired network. It runs all of the grown up office applications anyone ever uses anymore, installed via the corporate intranet app portal or preloaded in the base install. Disconnect it and take it home or to lunch or to a meeting, it has 4G/wifi connectivity and connects to the corporate VPN and internet facing secure services (corporate email and web-based collaboration software) seamlessly. Could such a beast compete with a Windows based system? Certainly. And the real devices of this sort from 2015 and 2020 will blow this simple hypothetical out of the water.<p>""Desktop computing"" won't go away, but it may well be redefined and subsumed by new platforms that come along. Indeed, I think it's far more likely that desktop computing in 2020 will share more in common with iOS and android than it will with Windows as we know it today.",1288344287

If this were back in the open source heyday it might not seem so out of place but at the end of 2010?<p>For some people open source was some sort of religion but the form it actually took was nothing more than loss leader.  You can't break into the OS market because MS is too embedded?  Then give your stuff away and make it up on the back end.  <i>This</i> is what you're seeing, not some ""power of open source"" nonsense.  Google doesn't care about open source, they care about getting an OS they can leverage on as many phones as possible so they can't be locked out on advertising.  Unix vendors used to give their OS away because it was the hardware they made their money on.<p>Today the tides are changing.  Now you can use micro-payments via the various application stores out there so developers no longer need to try and make some free source app in the hope of landing a job through it.  Now they can take their shot at the market place and hopefully become self sufficient.  Personally I'd rather become financially independent than land a ""great job"" working for someone else.

I fully know the risks of using open hotspots on many websites and I do it anyway because the convenience outweighs the risks for me.   Obviously I'd think twice about logging into my bank over a non-secure connection (though I'd be mad to bank with a company that doesn't secure all connections by default, of course), but open-wifi Facebook? Sure, why not?<p>This behavior extends beyond Internet usage. I (and probably most of you reading this) hand my credit/debit cards over to waiters several times per month knowing full well they could jot down enough information while out of my sight to make illegal charges on that card (if not do far worse via more elaborate identity theft schemes).  Risky?  Yes, but the extreme convenience outweighs the potential pain due to the low chance of actually being one of the people that gets exploited in this way, and thus it is with open hotspots and most Internet sites.",1288343567

Most of the young people in Austria speak English - so you won't have any trouble ordering food, going out partying or getting to know people (at least in an age group < 45).<p>If you plan to move to Vienna and are interested in any technical stuff, you should definably check out the Metalab to meet some people - I believe 90% of the people there are able to speak English (some are English-only speakers) and they might also help you meet other English-speaking people..",1288343498

Drop in some canned tomato and canned fish, and you can easily end up paying less than $1 for a totally balanced delicious meal, and you have produced in one swoop enough food to feed an adult for two full days.",1288343431

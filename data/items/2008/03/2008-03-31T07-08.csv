Terms and conditions: you cannot come back in 5 years and use this as an evidence that the idea was yours. All ideas submitted here will be available to the entire world and anyone is free to pursue them. now i won't give any because i believe ideas are worth a lot in the head, but just more when they are well executed.",1206949785

Those who have interested to follow the concept, can signup with Email. But it is never meant to make other people also to be excited as I do.
I apologize if the article conveyed a different message to readers.",1206949524

150851,comment,150390,150782,0,0,rokhayakebe,,,"my unproven theory is that it can actually be bad for an economy in general if a vast majority of the population  has a college degree. salaries will plunge, competition for positions will increase, degrees will loose their value, physicists will flip burgers, an emigration will increase drastically. off course that is until the nation can find a way to sell its talent to other countries. think India selling its IT services to the US and Europe.",1206949216
150850,comment,150694,150769,0,0,mixmax,,,"Darwin actually held back Origin species for more than ten years because it clashed with his religious beliefs. He only released it when  Alfred Russell Wallace sent him a letter asking him to look through a new theory on evolution,  which of course was the exact same one that Darwin had come up with many years before.<p>And yes I agree with you - the implications of this theory are so broad that with a bit of stretching it can probably explain the whole field of psychology. An amazing insight.",1206949154

You should definitely watch it if you haven't seen it before.<p>Norvig states his opinion slightly differently: of course being smart about algorithms is good. But until you get a lot of it, you often can't even fairly evaluate different algorithms. It's only when you're no longer getting significant gains from more data that you should then start thinking about being an algorithm smartypants.",1206949127

Apple consistently gets the highest marks in unbiased studies (Consumer Reports) for both the quality of its hardware, customer service and support.<p>To counter his anecdotal view I'll add mine; I also own a number of Macs and while I had problems with my 1400cs I have not had problems with my refurbished PowerBook.

Nowadays computing is more heterogeneous than ever with virtualization becoming more and more important.

150841,comment,149052,149052,0,0,ProkofyNeva,,,"I couldn't disagree more. This cultivated and mannered ideal that you espouse is rarely practiced on any real blog or forum with a passionate community, or an intelligent community versed in the issues, and that's <i>ok</i>. And your effort to put this out here like the 10 Commandments is just a typical male, geeky bloggy power play. And there, that may be an intolerable insult; it may even be incorrect! but it's not an ad hominem attack, what would be an hominem is to say that your argument is discredited because your name is Paul or you are white. Geeks and males and bloggers need to be characterized, judged, and condemned where necessary, without fear of favour.<p>It's all about trying to <i>control other people</i> when you put up one of these classic manipulative blog how-tos deliberately in a format to guarantee constant Google-fetching and repasting. These various Internet memes like ""OMG don't have a flamewar!"" OR ""OMG don't feed the trolls"" -- these are just tribalist imperatives that lead to horridly dull conformity and spread an awful pall over most social media. Argument is very, very important, and if it gets heated, and sparks fly, good! It's real!<p>Times vs. Sullivan, the landmark Supreme Court case that is a keystone of a lot of media freedom in the US, says basically it is ok to call someone a name. It's ok. It is allowed speech. And that's the sort of robust speech that occurs in a democracy.<p>It's very important to respond instantly to tone. Tone is what people think they can smuggle in, often, in the emotional medium of forums and blogs, and imagine they can get away with leaving these emotional trapdoors around for people to respond to instinctively, and it's good to bring it to light. They need to be called on it. Instantly. And fiercely sometimes. The tone you are taking here is preachy and hortatory. But one can only say, oh, stop it. Are you smug about all the fanboyz below, about all the people who will cut and paste your link like some latter-day Dear Abby?<p>Neuralgic types often imagine there is an ad hominem attack, when in fact there's a quite unbiased report. And they often call ""ad hominem"" something that is a much needed judgement about a person that really needs to be made.<p>Gregfjohnson is good to remember Aquinas here. But Aquinas also conceived of a number of ways for virtuous men to reach Heaven even if they were not believers or baptised or following the scriptures; had the different categories of those ""saved"" met each other and converse, the one might be astounded at the heresy and dissent of the other!<p>Re-stating people's arguments often infuriates them precisely because they don't want to be summarized and fed back in stark form, or take consequence for the tone and the hidden agendas they try to smuggle into forums and blogs. So it's not a magic bullet.<p>The surest way for a forums discussion to go downhill is for some smug nit to go and pull up some ""rules of rhetoric"" and beginning banging on somebody's head that they are breaking some arcane ""law of logic"". Oh, <i>do</i> stop it. People need to express themselves. They know exactly what they are hearing in tone and implication, and they are right to respond to it.",1206947966
150840,comment,150694,150724,0,0,yariv,,,"I don't think this is always the case. I think that many good ideas are obviously good regardless of their origin and even in the absence of external evidence. You can tell those ideas are good because they solve real problems in people's lives (Ebay, Yahoo, Craigslist, Amazon, Hotmail, etc, are all based on obviously good ideas).<p>To use Paul's analogy, some pots of gold are at the top of mountains, but others are visible on the flatlands, and only speed of execution determines who will win them.",1206947945

After you've been vectored off to an interesting Web page via a submission, don't forget to come back to HN and vote it up.<p>Veteran users can use their frustration with front page stories, and turn it into determination to find better stories.

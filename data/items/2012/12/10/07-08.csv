4898007,comment,4895710,4897766,2,0,tikhonj,,,"This is why I like the ability to define your own operator symbols. I think this is a good compromise between the C++/Python approach and the Java approach.<p>The C++ approach has the problems you outlined. A single operator name (like +) gets overloaded with far too many different--and often completely unrelated meanings. Particularly, this violates reasonable expectations about how certain operators behave; for example, + should be commutative. Python's + for lists, very clearly, isn't.<p>The Java approach of not allowing operator overloading or custom operators is also patently untenable. Just look at the BigInteger class! There are plenty of other cases when using an infix symbol makes for much clearer code.<p>With a language like Haskell, you can just come up with new operators as you need them. In fact, they act exactly like normal function names: the only difference is in how they're parsed. This also means they're overloaded like normal functions. So while there is a + operator for a bunch of different types, it always represents some notion of addition. This feature can be abused--it's relatively easy to write confusing operator names--but I've found it to be a net benefit in practice. If used correctly, it makes the code much clearer; you just have to be a little careful.<p>For example, in Haskell you use ++ to concatenate lists. So you can't mistake list concatenation for addition, which is important because they behave in very different ways.<p>As an aside, if you're willing to use Unicode symbols--and I think you should be!--then you can define cross as  and write a.cross(b) as a  b. In a small expression this does not seem like much of an advantage, but if you are doing more complicated math it makes the code easier to follow. It's also roughly as easy to type: with the right input mode, it's just a \times b.",1355126328

This allows us developers to look at the KanBan board, pick the next task and start working on it.<p>If for example right now I am not too interested in solving a scalability issue because it was only seen this one time and we can throw CPU power at it for now, I can move on to working on the logging/metrics stuff that interests me instead which will help us get a better insight into the system as a whole, and maybe that scalability issue will be solved differently because of more information.<p>Yes, we have a set direction (government contractors generally do), but I have a lot of leeway in that I can choose what I want to work on.<p>The same can be said for every other team in the company. It has allowed us to work together very well and yet at the same time makes it possible for all of us to work on things we thoroughly enjoy, AND time to switch off from one part of the project to another and solve another problem.

Nope, not at all.<p>- If your goal is impact and reach...you should be analyzing the traffic of the blogs you're contacting. A lot of those sites probably only have a few hundred readers. A review on Gizmodo & TUAW would probably be 10x more effective than mentions on all of those sites.<p>- We sometimes tend to forget that the R in PR stands relations. So build those relationships don't just spam.\n- Get to know bloggers (do your research) and get them to know you well before you go pitching (add value, send them tips, get to know them on twitter and IRL)<p>- Intros are also very helpful. Have a friend who got a review on <i>insert blog name</i>? Ask him to make an intro since he's established himself as someone who's made something newsworthy.<p>PR is kind of like trying to get a job. You could blast out 50+ generic resumes + cover letters and hope someone calls. Or you could do your homework, choose the top 3 companies you really want to join, get intros and do something remarkable to get noticed.",1355122917

Intelligence is good at representing information succinctly.\n2. This is similar to what a data compression algorithm does.\n3. Maybe if we come up with some uber-powerful compression algorithms, it will teach us something about intelligence too.<p>There's actually been a lot of papers about the parallels between data compression and AI.  Look up the program ""MegaHal"" and papers on it by Jason Hutchens.  He shows how a Markov model can be thought of as a kind of data compression.<p>That being said, there are theoretical limits on data compression efficiency, as shown by work by Shannon and Huffman.  These apply to lossless compression, so at best I think all they would be doing is experimentally verifying the theoretical limits.  If they want to find a data compression algorithm that tells them something about intelligence, it's going to have to be a lossy compression algorithm, not lossless.",1206295169

Maybe we should start with processor cores? I hear there's some open source HDL you can download for that. Or how about routing algorithms?",1206293190

144024,story,,,2,2,gcv,"Ask YC: Have you ever used an embedded web server C library?",,"I'm planning to write a small, light daemon. It'll essentially maintain an event queue for my app. It must be (1) very fast, (2) capable of dealing with a few TB of data, and (3) gracefully recover from total machine failure. I've been thinking about using Berkeley DB as the data store for its replication features. That way, I could bring up a few of instances of this daemon, and use one active master with the rest available as hot replicas and read-only copies of the queue.<p>The Berkeley DB APIs for, e.g., Python, lag behind the C, C++, and Java versions because Oracle doesn't officially support them. I thoroughly dislike both C++ and Java, and I'm actually quite comfortable with C, so I figured I'd just write all the storage code in C.<p>Clients for this queue should communicate to it over some cross-platform messaging system. I expect Python and Java code to want to talk to it, for example. HTTP seems to be a convenient way for the queue to accept requests. (Any other cross-platform messaging mechanism out there? I've heard of spread, but it seems a little heavy for what I need, and I don't know how cross-platform it is.)<p>I found two reasonable-seeming libraries which implement embedded HTTP servers in C: libmicrohttpd (http://gnunet.org/libmicrohttpd/, available in the Debian distribution), and shttpd (http://shttpd.sourceforge.net/, available in MacPorts). I also found something called LibHTTPD (http://www.hughes.com.au/products/libhttpd/), but it looks like a semi-abandoned commercial project and doesn't seem to support multithreaded listening anyway.<p>Question: has anyone here used these libraries? Any war stories? Any other packages I should look into?",1206292126

Metaphors wouldn't work otherwise.<p>Imagine if I'd written something about tides, and begun with a metaphor about swinging a condom full of liquid on the end of a string.  No doubt some Christian fundamentalists would be so offended at that point that they'd stop reading and write angry blog posts about how ""distasteful"" it was to compare God's Earth to a condom.  Would that be my fault?<p>You have to draw the line somewhere.  If you write about things that are difficult and/or controversial, some people will misunderstand you.  I try hard to write as clearly as I can, but the things you'd have to do to make an essay proof against readers who were really stupid or personally oversensitive about some topic would ruin it for the other readers.",1206291692
144022,comment,143148,143965,0,0,gruseom,,,"These terms come from Roman Jakobson's model of the functions of language. (Jakobson is the legendary structuralist linguist of whom it was said that he spoke 36 languages, each with a foreign accent.) The model had six functions; the others were emotive, conative (issuing a command), metalingual, and poetic.<p>The bit about using phatic language mostly with people one doesn't know well is not from Jakobson. I made it up, and it's probably wrong. I didn't go over that sentence 20-50 times :).",1206291633

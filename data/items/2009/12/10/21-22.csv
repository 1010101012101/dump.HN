I think it's that you don't have enough controls in your experiment.<p>I read this longish blog post in its entirety. I don't agree with all of it, but I think the author made some valid points, and that he's making a good-faith effort to be constructive. I also read the longish Giles Bowkett blog post you're talking about. It was very much <i>not</i> constructive, and in fact was all the way across the scale to conspiracy-theory, tinfoil-hat-style nutbar-ism. I'm not surprised it didn't score very well when it was posted here.<p>Have you noticed how Paul usually reacts to criticism? Say somebody posts a comment here that is vaguely critical of something he wrote. Paul's usual response is along the lines of: ""Are there specific things you can point out that I was wrong about?"" That doesn't sound to me like a guy who considers himself beyond criticism.",1260481928

The recording media (flash, hard-drive, tape, etc.) doesn't really matter because you're not going to be doing hours of continuous filming.  You DO (IMO) want a camera with an external mic adapter.  This is important because you'll likely want a wired or wireless lavalier mic in order to get good clear audio.<p>Check your local craigslist.

Beyond this, you need to ensure that proper ""consideration"" is given to the founders to make the IP transfers legally binding.

Nevertheless, I have my own list of gripes with Chrome tabs and windowing.<p>1) Closing the last tab closes the browser: Yes, I get that it's a fast browser and restarting a new instance is quick but when I close all the tabs, I am not ready to stop browsing. I am only trying to close the current tabs so I can go to some other site. Let me choose if I want the last close-tab to shutdown Chrome also or not.<p>2) No warning before 'close all': Seriously. Every browser has this. If I have a bunch of tabs open and by mistake I click the close button in Chrome, it just immediately shuts down. Let me choose if I want this to happen or not.<p>3) Top-left 'system menu': Every Windows application lets you left-click on the top-left corner of the window to get the system menu, while double-clicking the same top-left corner closes the window. Except in Chrome. Right-clicking the title bar does work but it's not the same.<p>4) Tiny '+' button for new tab: Sure I can use keyboard shortcuts but it's not always easy on a tablet. There's enough space in the tab-bar. Make the '+' a little wider. Also, use the top infinite space above the '+' icon.<p>5) Can't put the tabs on the bottom: That would be a nice option to have, though I'm ok with the tabs being on the top.<p>6) No simple way to open bookmarks in new tabs automatically.<p>7) No way to set if newly opened tabs (via a-href target=_blank or right-click 'open in new tab') should go to background or get into foreground.<p>8) Permanently pin a tab: I'd love to always have Hacker News, reddit, gmail, and my todo list pinned. If I restart Chrome, the pinned tabs go away. It's not the same as putting all of them in the startup list.<p>This being said, I recently switched to Chrome on all 3 of my regular PCs/laptops after 6 years of Firefox/Firebird/Mozilla. Chrome is super fast, finally has some ad-blocking, syncs my bookmarks (though that's not perfect), and is standards-compliant.",1260480028

Perhaps as an applicant, you can set a base price and a frequency of contact. Maybe you only allow one recruiter to contact you per week or day.  If you want to be that recruiter, it'll cost you minimum $1.  If more than one recruiter wants to contact you, they bid up the price.<p>Applicants could regulate the minimum price based on their current status. If they are employed happily, the price is $1000.  If they are unemployed, perhaps it's zero with unlimited contacts until they get flooded and then the price goes up.<p>The economics of such an idea is interesting. It assumes a shift in power from the employer to the applicant. The best of the best will rise to the top and a natural ranking of applicants will evolve based on the bid.

It's acronym is FDD, which stands for Fear Driven Development.<p>A few other patterns may make appearances, depending on the organization, but the practical upshot is something a former manager of mine kept on about regarding working at large, asshole driven organizations: focus <i>only</i> on requirements. Do precisely what you are told to do, and precisely what you are told to do it on, and do absolutely nothing else to anything else. For developers, this involves fixing or implementing precisely what the bug ticket tells you to, and committing precisely that to the repository. For the tester, this involves testing precisely that feature or fix the ticket indicates, and not suggesting in any way that another related fix could be rolled into this one with little effort. For the project manager, this consists of having endless meetings with people to make <i>absolutely</i> certain the items on the task list are prioritized correctly, and dragging developers and testers into those meetings to project an image that your organization is ""engineering driven"".<p>Expect that if you violate this tenet, you will face unwanted consequences, even if things turn out well for what you were working on. It doesn't matter that you made things better for the organzation; you usurped the task-delegation authority of someone else, and it is quite possible that person was hired for that specific purpose. If you show you can self-manage, this person is now redundant, so it is in their best interest to show you can't self-manage by making sure you are scared completely shitless of ever doing so. Vague threats and social politics work well here.<p>But it's not that the individual wants to abide by these particular patterns; it's that they are wedged into a political canyon. They know that whatever effort they might put in to making things better will result in them being fired for insubordination as soon as someone finds out what they've done. Would they like to keep their job and deal with a horrible codebase, or would they like to lose their job and have nothing but the bitter taste of a horrible legacy codebase you can now do nothing about.<p>These are all symptoms; the cause I've always seen is that the staff are scared shitless, and want to make sure no one can hold them responsible for anything.

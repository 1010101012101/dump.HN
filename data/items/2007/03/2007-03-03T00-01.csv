b) There are some things where relative accomplishments are OK, like sports. Saying you're an Olympic gold medalist means you're just better than everybody else, but it's still quite an accomplishment. ",1172882233

There were so many people held down by the old narrow-channel world.<p>YC itself is a lot like a user-generated content startup. We encourage young hackers to start their own companies instead of just going to work for existing ones, and we profit (hopefully) by the potential energy thus liberated.<p>",1172882139
1910,comment,1901,1901,0,0,Alex3917,,,"There's two types of jobs. Those where what you do creates value for people within the company, and those where what you do creates value for people outside the company. You only need a degree for the former.<p>Rule of thumb: Ask someone what their greatest accomplishment is. If what they say is relative, i.e. ""I am better than someone else at ___,"" then chances are they aren't very good at anything. <p>Avoid those whose self-worth comes from comparing themselves to others, be it through degrees or GPA or money, etc. They're losers and hanging out with them will keep you from accomplishing anything in life.<p>The funniest thing is that investment banks hire based on GPA even though there is zero correlation between GPA and alpha, and alpha is 100% of your job performance.

1909,comment,1826,1826,0,0,precipice,,,"I'm Marc Hedlund, one of the founders of the company.<p>We have eight employees total, and yes, we have a real support line (support@wesabe.com).  I usually answer, but you can talk to any of us through it.  You can also write me directly at marc@wesabe.com if you want to.<p>The 800 number has been great, and I'd recommend it to any startup.  We put it up there since we're handling privacy-sensitive information, and we wanted people to be able to talk to an actual person about what we do.  I figured the absolute worst case was that Jason would spend a lot of time talking to customers and potential customers.  Seems like a great worst case to me.  (The second-worst case, that no one calls, has a pretty low cost associated with it.)<p>Anyway, it's worth doing for any startup, I think.  People love talking to people, and an anonymous web site isn't as friendly as a phone number you can call.  Doug is right that it won't scale, but for now, all the possible outcomes are good.",1172881802

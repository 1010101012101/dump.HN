I used to be a graphic designer for one such organization, and it was next to impossible to create marketing collateral based on design standards; they&#x27;d rather buy it in a template kit from an office supply store than wait for a better plan to unfold. I later watched as they completely missed a huge opportunity to go upmarket with the proprietary hardware technology that the product staff developed. They were so obsessed with what was right in front of them that they became embroiled in tactics without strategy, and only the amazing breadth and depth of the market allowed them to continue making a profit without punishing them too severely.",1431986344

9567079,comment,9566441,9566654,0,0,saidajigumi,,,">  Fish not being bash compliant was a deal breaker for me.<p>Would you mind elaborating here?  I&#x27;m very honestly curious how the deal gets broken for you.<p>To explain my curiosity, I&#x27;ve long since come to the opinion that we&#x27;re in the midst of a long, somewhat painful split caused by a design dissonance over improving the interactive shell UX versus creating a better environment for scripting.<p>We&#x27;ve been building alternatives around the scripting problem for ages now, perhaps most notably starting with Perl&#x27;s ascendance.  That legacy continues with Python, Ruby, and now many other tools.  I&#x27;ll still reach for bash/zsh as a scripting tool, but only when the situation absolutely will not admit an extra dependency.  In my experience, the pain factor goes up far more quickly with code complexity when it&#x27;s all just gotta be done in POSIX/bash land.<p>As for the interactive shell UX, fish is notable for simply putting its foot down and just saying &quot;no&quot; to the scripting side.  It pushes out POSIX scripting compatibility as an external feature.  Calling bash is now on the same level as calling out to {Perl, et. al.}.  Whether or not fish is your cup of tea, it&#x27;s inspired a bunch of competing work in the traditional interactive shells.<p>At the current time, the above efforts are simply going in different directions.  We have numerous better options for rich automation than POSIX shell scripting.  Likewise, shell scripting just gets in the way of creating better, extensible developer/admin CLI environments.  It has too many quirks (hi, quoting hell!) and limitations (real data structures, please) to work well for an extensibility platform.",1431985974

It&#x27;s a bit like homeless shelters: they&#x27;re there to help, but they sure as hell don&#x27;t &quot;fix&quot; people from being homeless.<p>And more importantly, <i>therapy does not cure PTSD</i>. You can&#x27;t just go to a doctor, talk about your feelings and suddenly you&#x27;re trauma-free. Regardless of any therapy taking place, there is still a potential for harm, and so we still need to actually care about not harming people whenever it is reasonable to do so. Sometimes it will be reasonable, and other times not. I think it&#x27;s important to recognize we need to have a multi-colored approach to issues that negatively affect people&#x27;s lives, rather than a black & white approach.",1431985672

There are perhaps two legitimate uses. One is to act as a “safety net” in case the owner of an object forgets to call its explicit termination method. While there’s no guarantee that the finalizer will be invoked promptly, it may be better to free the resource late than never, in those (hopefully rare) cases when the client fails to call the explicit termination method. But the finalizer should log a warning if it finds that the resource has not been terminated, as this indicates a bug in the client code, which should be fixed. If you are considering writing such a safety-net finalizer, think long and hard about whether the extra protection is worth the extra cost.<p>...<p>A second legitimate use of finalizers concerns objects with native peers. A native peer is a native object to which a normal object delegates via native methods. Because a native peer is not a normal object, the garbage collector doesn’t know about it and can’t reclaim it when its Java peer is reclaimed. A finalizer is an appropriate vehicle for performing this task, assuming the native peer holds no critical resources. If the native peer holds resources that must be terminated promptly, the class should have an explicit termination method, as described above. The termination method should do whatever is required to free the critical resource. The termination method can be a native method, or it can invoke one.&quot;",1431985164

These modifications may include creating more script code, pulling in networked resources, or any other damn fool thing.<p>Second, that game is only going to run on a narrow selection of hardware. It&#x27;s not going to run on a machine from ten years ago, probably. It&#x27;s not going to run on a machine ten years from now, probably.<p>Third, that game is built to use files and formats specifically made for itself.

There are particular industries (engineering, banking, aerospace, defense, for some examples) where it -has- to be correct. These are also the industries where at least the final product should probably be waterfall or spiral, and generally you need formalism all the way down.<p>The problem comes when people bring lessons learned from that to companies that don&#x27;t need that level of assurance. Documentation that&#x27;s never read again is a waste. Spending time to make tests replayable if they&#x27;ll never be replayed again is a waste. And so forth.<p>As for bugs being literally unknown, I&#x27;m jealous--it&#x27;d be nice to claim I ever guided a project to that state. But keep in mind that&#x27;s different than no bugs period, just means no bugs in what was tested or used.<p>If you&#x27;re delivering a product with very specific use cases, flows and a tight scope with strong bumpers around anything unintended, it&#x27;s pretty straightforward to guarantee all that. But if you&#x27;re delivering a sandbox product on the internet to a bunch of randoms, much less so.<p>After all, ten checkboxes on a dialog are 1024 testcases. That&#x27;s not even accounting for free-entry fields. You&#x27;ll never cover all combinations of all uses of the whole app interface, ever, period, and equivalences and fuzz testing only get you so far. That&#x27;s a simple (if slightly fantastic) example for UI testing, but the same basic thing applies to most other kinds of testing.

And though it is true cases like this exist, it is a tiny part of the story of Drug Court.  It gives no credit to Drug Court&#x27;s immense success. I have personally met dozens if not hundreds of addicts that came into recovery only through drug court, and have achieved long term recovery, and have become productive members of society.<p>After touting the worst case scenario and ignoring the success, this article puts a little missive in there about how doctors (those mostly with no personal experience in addiction or recovery) prefer opioid maintenance. This is but another marketing message for Suboxone, in the massive PR campaign underway to create an alternative to drug-free recovery through long term addiction to a pharmaceutical product. In the recovery community, Suboxone is referred to as Drug Replacement Therapy (DRT) because that is what it is, switching street dope for dope that comes from your doctor. It gets you high enough to avoid withdrawal, but not so high that you can&#x27;t move boxes or burgers in an entry-level job. If you do try to get off the Subs, you will experience withdrawal that makes heroin withdrawal look like a walk in the park on a sunny day with a sno-cone and a puppy. This article also fails to mention the suicide rate of people on Suboxone. While I have no hard data on that (ONLY because it has never been studied), I can tell you it happens. It&#x27;s happened to people I&#x27;ve known. It happens because so long as they are addicted to dope, doctor prescribed or otherwise, the deeply traumatized individual who is an addict remains traumatized. They will never experience the true freedom, healing and wholeness that comes only through deep self-examination and a conversion process of equal or greater magnitude, that leads to self- and social integration. DRT only treats the most visible symptoms of addiction, and does nothing to treat the underlying cause.<p>While I know not everyone succeeds as a result of drug court, on balance, it is a net positive. Some people need to be re-arrested 2 or 3 times before it takes. And some die. This is an unfortunate reality of addiction. And opioid maintenance IS addiction. It really is up to the individual to work through their trauma, and find the needed support to exist and find a reason to continue living. That cannot be imposed by law, coercion, or prescription.<p>Bottom line though, research the history of Heroin in the United States. A hundred or so years ago, heroin was touted as the solution for morphine addicts. It was the Drug Replacement Therapy of that time. We have been down this road before and we know where it leads.",1431984242

You could use either naming conventions or splitting the repos up to track different repos for different packages, but it starts looking like an antipattern to me (i.e. the way you would have firefox track jessie while you are on wheezy would be by setting up your own repo only for firefox, a bit of an hassle).

I beg to differ on his reasoning.<p>1) While the moves are more erratic in the last 20 years, the degree of change is no that different... from 1975-1995 it was around +300%; from 1995-2015 is was around +300%... suggesting that the trend goes back further than his article accounts for with respect to the Reagan tax cuts.<p>2) Klein&#x27;s argument is quite specious in my view... stating &quot;it just wasn&#x27;t done&quot; without supporting evidence just doesn&#x27;t cut it.<p>One could just as easily argue that this &quot;phenomenon&quot; is correlated to the Clinton administration&#x27;s repeal of the Glass-Steagal Act, or the Nixon administration&#x27;s unilateral renege on the Bretton-Woods arrangement through the closing of the Fed&#x27;s gold window.

Here&#x27;s a view from a different part; the part where a project has a lifecycle of a decade or so.<p>I used to work for a software consultancy that had been acquired by a US defence company (second tier). Over the previous 15 years, the software consultancy had elevated their QA to the point that bugs in the delivered product were literally unknown. Nobody ever saw any in the delivered product, over a decade. Every requirement could be traced to the design that would meet it, to the code that implemented it, to the test that verified it. The test documentation was beautiful, and anyone could (and did) execute a complete set of tests, writing their own personal signature on every confirmation of test success. The signed test specs were scanned before being sealed in an envelope against the customer ever choosing to inspect. QA had (and did) veto over requirements, design, and tests.<p>We were working with two other major, globally known defence names, and the customer had learned through experience that when something went wrong, come to us last. Sometimes, the customer came to us to ask us to work out which of the other companies involved had screwed up (because sometimes, the other companies were themselves unable to work it out). Once, they sued one of the other names for incompetency and gave us their work because we knew how to fix it better than they did, because our interface tests highlighted everything that their software didn&#x27;t do in accordance with the spec.<p>We could replay any test, at any version, at any time, and compare the results now with the signed results then from the sealed envelope. The time savings we had because we got things right the first time, by doing it properly, was immense.<p>Where this is going is that this was priceless. We had the customer&#x27;s absolute trust, based on experience. Nobody ever found a bug in our delivered software (I&#x27;m not saying there weren&#x27;t any; I&#x27;m saying that our QA was thorough enough that the customer was never going to do anything with it that we hadn&#x27;t tested already). Code coverage, all warnings on, static analysis, valgrind, cross-platform compilation and testing, we did everything. Customers outright told us that we were worth paying extra because of the peace of mind and the reduced risk, so they paid us more and we spent less doing it.<p>QA is time and money. The better your QA, the more time you will have and the more money you will make.",1431983985

We all know intuitively that it&#x27;s not all needed a lot of the time and the success stories are clear, so the trust in any of it is undermined. So then you get a dev culture saying &quot;QA is unnecessary, we can handle all of it,&quot; which is generally true at the beginning but can send your company off a cliff if you don&#x27;t manage transition.<p>The sad part is that even once quality processes get around that, the all-or-nothing attitude leads to a pyrrhic victory. Quality teams still end up only doing what can be afforded (because math) but everyone <i>thinks</i> they should be doing more. That leads to the pervasive opinion of ineffective quality teams. And, unfortunately, the scramble of <i>trying</i> to do everything at once (and therefore mastering none of it) often makes that a self-fulfilling prophecy.<p>And I love that it stresses that QA is about hedging bets. Bugs get out, period. The gatekeeper attitude is what leads to the do all the things attitude in the first place. &quot;At any cost&quot; is generally a bad way to strategize.<p>As for this chart, I&#x27;d have added exploratory/informal to seed B2C--exploratory is biggest bang for buck for finding new bugs, and incubating products are -all- new bugs--but I suspect they&#x27;re lumping what I&#x27;d have recommended under dogfooding.<p>So yeah, very nice. Of course, the best thing to do in any situation is consider the context of your company, product, and market. Think about how maintainable it really needs to be and what would cause the most damage: losing customer money, leaking their data, embarrassing you in the market, eroding their trust. Are there only a few customers to lose or are you mass market and can afford a round of sufficiently obscure failure?<p>Those are the things to prioritize when you start picking your battles.

What is faster today on one, might be slower tomorrow.<p>GPUs are very good at doing lots of floating point math. Historically, CPUs have been better at dealing with branching, multiple instruction issue, out of order execution, integer math, and really pile on the cache architectures. CPUs have SIMD too so they are no slouch for lots of floating point calculations either.<p>Since memory (I/O) is now one of the largest bottlenecks for both GPUs and CPUs because memory bus speeds are much slower than both, this will often be your dominant factor. Since most of your data comes from main RAM, your CPU often lives closer to the data and tends to have aggressive cache architectures (L1, L2, L3 caches) to help, thus giving the CPU an advantage when data is not local.<p>I don&#x27;t know if it still holds true, but NxM matrix math used to be faster on CPUs for very large values of N,M because for cache locality, the CPU had an easier time keeping values that needed to be reused in the matrices in cache.

My grandfather owned railroad stock, real railroad stock.  Not a fund that owned a fund that owned 50 railroad stocks.  You don&#x27;t see that so much anymore.  Diversification is good other than the immense parasitic load, which worsens at low return rates obviously... anyway investment has been abstracted away from the public, both by mutualization as per above and obviously by the destruction of the middle class (a stereotypical factory worker in 1970 probably owned some stock, at least in a retirement fund, but a stereotypical American of 2015 only gets minimum wage McJob or Walmart worker no benes no retirement savings at all therefore has little/no skin in the game anymore and no reason to care).

Equity markets are broken, don&#x27;t matter much anymore.  And with SOX compliance they suck for fund raising.  We have a lot of capital sloshing around blowing bubbles and no legal way to apply it anymore.<p>Finally it was invented pre-central bank, and our equity prices now mostly represent central bank interest rates.  Lower rates mean you get a lower return from riskless .gov bonds means equities need to return less, means in a constant dividend world, the price will explode once return rates around zero beat sticking the money in a mattress or .gov bonds.  The PE ratio of our stock equities are controlled by the .gov centrally controlled interest rate, more or less, at least on a very long term.  So obviously a multi-generational low in interest rates results in a multi-generational high in equity prices.  How could it be otherwise?

Who are you and your current team? Have you done a startup before? What was the end result of that? What makes this startup special?<p>2. You are asking the applicant to take on significant risk from your posting. First, you want someone to apply that has a good bit of experience, but are only offering equity for the time being. Second you are making two very big assumptions: (a) that you will have a liquidity event in 2 years; and (b) that you will obtain funding towards the end of the year. While these sound great in theory, there is a better than average chance this will not happen. How does the applicant guard against developing an entire platform for you and a year from now still not being paid?<p>3. You are not providing any details regarding the business until an &quot;in-person interview&quot;. Sorry but I don&#x27;t know many people that will travel just to go to an interview to find out what a company is planning to do.<p>4. I understand that this is a &quot;co-founder&quot; role, but you describe it more as a first hire. I understand that most co-founders forego salary in hopes of the big payday, but in this case you have not lured the applicant into knowing you, your product, or the chances of that payday. To be a &quot;co-founder&quot; with no salary for what could be at least a 6 month period, I for one would have to have some amount of trust in my other co-founders and more importantly the idea itself.<p>5. If it is more of a &quot;first-hire&quot; situation you may want to make sure all your legal ducks are in a row from an employment perspective. Hiring someone with no salary/pay walks the line on being illegal at least in the U.S.. Something you may want to consider when nailing down an agreement.

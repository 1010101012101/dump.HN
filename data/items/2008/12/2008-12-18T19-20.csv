We must do it because we can already see the decline of extracted resources like oil and minerals.  We will do it because we can.  The internet has enabled telecommuting.  Telecommuting enables the move to smaller communities where housing is cheaper.  As robots get more capable they will take over the manufacturing base.<p>I think we are closer to a post scarcity economy than we realize.  The biggest big ticket item is housing.  The biggest item in the cost of housing in sub/urban areas is land. If we disperse to small towns, the cost of land goes down. If housing were really low cost and we telecommuted, maybe 10 or 20 hours of work per week would meet our needs.  Suppose we adopted a Peace Corps/Habitat for Humanity model.  After school/college a person spent 3 years building housing, including their own?  Maybe all he has to mortgage is the land and materials.  Maybe not even that.<p>Add other ideas like a robot taxi service, 3D copying machines, reasonable health care; and the need for much of the need for the credit economy would disappear.  I don't view this as a socialist utopia, more a natural evolution of our current market economy.

402481,comment,401753,402260,0,0,Retric,,,"Hydrogen is far less efficient than battery tech so I don't see an advantages as far a a daily car.  As to gas vs electric moters an electric car can have a two gear transmission without sacrificing significant efficiency where gas engines need a much smaller RPM range to keep em happy and at peek power output.  At the high end HP and cooling are significantly less of an issue with electric and with a fast battery swap system they can even be fueled faster than gas powered cars.  But the real advantage is how much you can mold the car's balance and weight vs gas.  Not to mention the traction advantages when each wheel can have power rapidly applied independently.<p>PS: For now electric cars only have about 1/5 the energy storage vs. a full tank of gas, but in every other way they win and gas has a fixed energy storage limit where battery's keep getting better.",1229627506

""Capture the moment"".  We all know that moment, when we are particularly moved.  It doesn't last, at least not in intensity.  Facilitating a ""positive"" outcome seems likes a potential business.<p>My impression is with TipJoy, one can make a small contribution immediately, eliminating the hesitation around picking which worthy causes to contribute to (at the $20, $50, $100, whatever ""level"").  Also that one can maintain control of contributions by limiting funding of the account and/or by viewing summarized activity there.<p>Do I have that right?<p>Finally, just having read a story about print news' continued demise, I'll ask:  What about a similar contribution model for good reporting?  After a particularly good read, I might be willing to toss are dollar or two in the direction of the author/publisher.  I know, micropayments are hardly a new idea.  This is another market that TipJoy is after?<p>Thanks.  I'm intrigued now to learn more about TipJoy.",1229627132

Whatever was your inspiration?<p>WireOver was born out of sheer annoyance, because it's <i>ridiculous</i> that sending files over WANs and LANs is still such a pain.<p>Our guiding principle: BE NOT ANNOYING.<p>Ads would be annoying, so they're out. File size limits are annoying. Failed transfers are annoying, slow transfers are annoying, cluttered UIs are annoying, not sleeping well at night because you're worried about security is annoying.<p>Transfers should find the fastest route automatically - over internet or LAN - and they should go seamlessly between Mac, Windows, and Linux. That's what we want ourselves as users. We'd be pleased as punch to lower the annoyance level for others too.",1332316758

It has advantages in being ad-free (for now at least), supporting unlimited sizes (ditto), auto-resume, return receipts, and encryption (though I suspect some of the existing sites may have these too).<p>It'll still be a winner if it provides a better user experience than the others, of course.

As with anything in the government, that will be subject to tons of lobbying, earmarking, waste, and endless debate.<p>But if you think about it, Pharma drugs are actually similar to SW or movies or music.  In each of those, a large investment produces a good which is cheap to replicate (knowledge of efficacy/safety of a compound, or in SW / movies / music, bits arranged a certain way).<p>Each of these need protection on the investment to create it, so that there can be a return.<p>In SW, music, and movies/etc, that protection is essentially copyright law.<p>The only difference with Pharma is that copyright law doesn't buy them anything.  So they need some other mechanism of protection.<p>Maybe it doesn't have to be a patent: how about an exclusive government license to sell a pharmaceutical tied to the FDA approval.  Kind of like a pharmaceutical-specific patent.<p>The key is that financing still happens via private means, and there isn't a fixed quota of budget or # of drugs...   Let the market decide the right amount for our society to spend on drugs.<p>The government should step in when there is a market failure (e.g. unpriced externalities, or tragedy-of-the-commons, etc).

The episodes were available to stream from the website, but (at the time) i was unable to do that on the go.  So I torrented them... and then i donated $100 to the program.  Listening to the radio shows was only really practical when i was commuting and it turned me into a huge fan.  Now i donate regularly, if it wasn't for bitorrent I'm not sure that would be the case.  Nowadays i have a smartphone and there is a TAL app that lets you download episodes for 'offline' listening.  So i probably wouldn't do it that way again, but still bitorrent provided an extremely valuable service to me,  and i think it also provided a good service to TAL.",1332313554

Italian and French cooking is a passion of mine, and I had this plan of starting a catering business. While it is a fun side project, I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't want to do it fulltime. I can live with the pay cut if you're doing something that you love, but after a while you kind of miss using your brain instead of your hands. The upside is that you're directly in contact with your customers, which is refreshing after building web apps for people you never meet in person. Very rewarding to see and hear that they are happy with something you've made.<p>Occasionally I do a catering gig, so it's more like a nice, paid hobby.<p>On a side note, if you're looking for a stress-free job, don't do anything that has to do with restaurants or catering. It's like juggling six flaming torches in one hand while being yelled at.",1332313377

You more-or-less say x `pseq` y and it will try to evaluate them in separate threads if possible. The RTS statistics will tell you how many sparks got ""converted"" to run on another CPU and whatnot, so you can compare and see if you actually got an improvement, but it is a bit easier than spinning up dedicated threads, assuming you're parallelizing pure computations. For true concurrency, you still need to deal with threads.",1332313342

I also lived across from another rug dealer who did pretty well. His name was Tom Freston and for those of you who are kind of young, he was the main guy at MTV a long time ago. I set a meeting with MTV just by calling him up and persisting. You never know what you can accomplish when you put your mind to it.

But your comment nonetheless reads unpleasantly, because the question &quot;ever met a seriously hot girl?&quot; assumes that the reader is a (straight) male, or, conceivably, a lesbian. That&#x27;s the sort of wording that makes women feel unwelcome in communities like HN; it&#x27;s essentially equivalent to having a discussion with a male and female colleague in which you address all of your comments to the man and ignore the woman. In general, you&#x27;ll likely get a better response, and be able to avoid the &quot;not sexist&quot; disclaimers, if you write as if you were speaking to a mixed-gender audience (which you are!).  In this case that could be as simple as s/girl/person/.",1412902793

8435706,comment,8431653,8434481,0,0,anatoly,,,"I find David and Ben Crystal&#x27;s efforts to promote the Original Pronunciation admirable, but ever since I&#x27;ve heard their version of Sonnet 116 a few years ago, I&#x27;ve harbored doubts about their particular choices. Several books I read on Early Modern English phonetics agree that love-prove, love-move, love-remove etc. are not visual rhymes. But Ben Crystal chooses to pronounce all these words with the short [ʌ] sound (like the vowel of modern &#x27;cut&#x27;). And I think it&#x27;s wrong (well, not on my own authority, I&#x27;m not a linguist or a specialist in this area, just someone very interested in historical phonetics of English who read a bunch of books and articles).<p>Words like move, remove, prove used to be pronounced with the long [o:] sound before the Great Vowel Shift (which is how they got their spelling), and by Shakespeare&#x27;s time they moved to [u:], which they retained until modern times. I tried to find any evidence <i>other than the love- rhymes</i> that these words could be pronounced with a short [ʌ] sound, and couldn&#x27;t.<p>On the other hand, &quot;love&quot; was probably pronounced usually with a short [u] sound, the same sound we use today in &quot;put&quot;. All the words with u in a closed syllable used that sound as well, like &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;but&quot;, &quot;cup&quot; &quot;sun&quot; etc. The change from this [u] to [ʌ] happened after Shakespeare&#x27;s time, mostly later in the 17th century, resulting in the familiar pronunciation of &quot;but&quot; &quot;cup&quot; &quot;sun&quot;, but leaving after it a fair number of exceptions that refused to follow the change, such as &quot;put&quot; &quot;push&quot; etc.<p>&quot;prove&quot; and &quot;love&quot; did rhyme when Shakespeare used them; but perhaps the rhyme was a bit inexact, rhyming long [u:] of &quot;prove/move/remove&quot; and short [u] of &quot;love&quot; (but still much more exact than modern [u:] and [ʌ] of course). Or, as Charles Barber claims in his &quot;Early Modern English&quot; (unwieldly Google Books links: <a href=""http://bit.ly/1uI7SWQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/1uI7SWQ</a>), &quot;love&quot; was exceptional in having a variant [u:] pronunciation especially beloved by poets, precisely because they could use it to rhyme it with handy words like &quot;prove&quot; and &quot;move&quot;. Either way, the love/move rhyme did not sound at all the way Ben Crystal pronounces it.",1412901725
8435705,comment,8435548,8435548,0,0,ChristopherM,,,"This is horrible advice, men and women both must push for a raise, companies will absolutely under no circumstances just give away raises because &quot;it&#x27;s the right thing to do&quot;.<p>Case in point, I am a white male.  When I started working at a company over a decade ago I also started at the same time as another white male.  I started at $55k, he started at $52k I negotiated for an additional $3k from the start.  The first year I assumed they would give me a good raise since I was hired at entry level wages, I got a $2k raise.  I was livid.  The next year I made a huge deal about the tiny raise, I ended up getting $5k, now up to $62k.  Year after $3k, again not happy.  During that year there was a &quot;salary freeze&quot;, I told my boss that was unacceptable, if I didn&#x27;t get a promotion I would be leaving.  So I got another $5k during the salary freeze.  The next year still not happy, I made the same ultimatum, This time $10k.  Up to $80k, I ended up leaving a couple of months later for a management position.<p>In contrast that other software engineer?  He got $2k per year, except for the salary freeze year, they made it up the year after.  He left after 5 years making $62k<p>Me ->  $55k, $57k, $62k, $65k, $70k, $80k<p>Him -> $52k, $54k, $56k, $58k, $58k, $62k<p>So, apparently by being the squeaky wheel I ended up making an additional $18k a year by the time we both left.  Plus all the additional money I made the preceding years.<p>Lesson here?  Make yourself very valuable to the company, and then make them pay.  They won&#x27;t do it of their own free will.  Look at it from their perspective, if you don&#x27;t say anything why would they do anything?  Obviously you are happy if you are not complaining.<p>The problem for women is that, in general, they don&#x27;t speak up, they don&#x27;t negotiate for salary increases they just accept what is offered.  What we really need to do is to teach women how to understand what they are really worth, and to negotiate from a position of strength.",1412901702

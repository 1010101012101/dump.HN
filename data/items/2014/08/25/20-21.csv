8224203,comment,8219506,8223908,3,0,Joeri,,,"I don&#x27;t think typing speed factors into it. It&#x27;s more a factor of cognitive load. While programming you are working at the level of &quot;expressions&quot;, and your speed is limited to how quickly you can turn business logic into appropriate sets of expressions. Programming languages that are lower level require more expressions to say the same thing, hence are slower to program in. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a controversial notion to say that assembly is less productive than C, which is less productive than Python. The reason is the number of lines (or rather expressions) needed to achieve a piece of functionality. The business logic most definitely does not take the same amount of time when written in assembly compared to python. The higher level languages tend to be more productive, but it is only a given if the higher level language is actually more concise.<p>Here are some papers that underbuild this argument:\n<a href=""http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/jccpprt_computer2000.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://page.mi.fu-berlin.de/prechelt/Biblio/jccpprt_computer...</a>\n<a href=""https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/rerg/amadeus/teaching/seminars/seminar_ws0203/Seminar_3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://files.ifi.uzh.ch/rerg/amadeus/teaching/seminars/semi...</a>",1409000206

CLARITY is very important.  Your workflow and process aside, it&#x27;s the person on the phone who we interact with and get any barometer into, and this is something I&#x27;ve found very painful in my own experiences with Google interviews, either...<p>A.  They ask a question, or respond to a question in a way that is very difficult to not get thrown by.  In my own experience, this was being asked to implement an RB tree on the fly (when I&#x27;ve told my friends inside the big G that I was asked this they always go &quot;wait what&quot;, but my hand to god, this happened.), and when I responded with &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, that datastructure relies very heavily on getting some very precise rotations right that I simply don&#x27;t have memorized.  Can I look them up and try going from there?&quot;  I was met with &quot;Hm, no, let&#x27;s move on, I would normally just expect my interviewee to just know the answer&quot;, a response which, to put it VERY lightly, added insult to injury. Or...<p>B:  Accent.  I realize this is probably a sensitive subject, and I don&#x27;t mean this in a &quot;everyone should speak English flawlessly&quot;, but if you&#x27;re communicating over a more lossy medium like phone, you have to be aware that a heavy accent only contributes to the difficulty in shared understanding, which contributes to feeling stressed and confused, which... etc, back and forth.  Multiple Google interviews I was a part of occurred with interviewers I could barely understand, and regularly had to ask to repeat themselves, which I&#x27;m sure on some level to the interviewer didn&#x27;t help impress me to them.<p>2. Feedback and culture.  Despite the above, I had the opportunity to intern at Google.  I was always somewhat proud (I promise I&#x27;m not trying to dick-wave in this, bear with me :) ) that my feedback from my manager reported me as at or above expectations, however, I was told in no uncertain terms that I was not a good culture fit (Admittedly, I was &#x27;young&#x27;, and needed a good smack on the head, but it really bites that perception is valued more than contribution, especially when you&#x27;re not given actionable ways to improve), and never received a single atom of feedback, either in my tenure there or during the interviews (&quot;you could have perhaps solved that like X&quot;, sort of things) to put me at ease or give me any sense that there was room for personal improvement.  I realize the potential legal ramifications in this, but, it&#x27;s a problem, it needs to be improved, I refuse to accept that with all the smart people at G a solution can&#x27;t be found :)<p>Sorry for the rant, this has been a subject that&#x27;s been itching at me for a few years now, and the chance to braindump at someone who might actually have visibility into the why/how of all of this is very welcome.",1409000015

This gave him tons of feedback, money to keep working, and incentive to keep going because people were constantly asking him for features and tweaks.<p>2) He employed a simple and fun mechanic that allowed users to create their own things in the game (forts castles etc).<p>3) all of the content is procedurally generated. So every time you play it you get a different experience to some extent.<p>4) From very early on you would get weekly updates pushed out constantly adding new features. For most people new things were being added far faster than they could get bored with them.<p>5) it ran everywhere.<p>6) He didn&#x27;t focus on graphics.

Humans make a lot of assumptions that often end up being wrong: but enough of them are correct that they&#x27;re still useful.<p>We trust computers to be unimpeachably accurate because we as humans are not. If computers need to make the types of assumptions that humans do, then they lose a good deal of their accuracy (and their usefulness).<p>Human language is also visually difficult to read. The biggest improvement that symbolic languages (specifically, modern programming languages) make is the use of spacing and symbols to break apart complex processes into sub-sections, loops, etc.<p>Furthermore, I disagree with your statement that &quot;natural language is a standard we already have and works fine.&quot; Language is not static, nor is it standard. Sure, we may have &quot;standard&quot; grammar rules, but even those can vary from region to region and many people don&#x27;t follow the rules on a day to day basis. It&#x27;s not a static target, so developing something that could interpret natural language means developing an artificial intelligence capable of taking nuance, context and the like into account.<p>EWD was simply claiming that such a system applied to general purpose computing would be so complicated as to be wildly impractical.",1408998130

Because it is not really in dispute that they are two separate entities. Are they both Julius Caesar, the man? Or is one Julius Caesar and the other a copy? If you sent them both into a room together and asked them to come out again, how do you determine which one is the copy? This is an admittedly contrived example, but it&#x27;s relevant because in a computer we can and often do copy objects, change them, then care to distinguish between identity and equality.<p>Certainly we could come up with linguistic rules to differentiate them, but for the sake of convenience (or maybe because each of us possesses an incomplete knowledge of linguistic rules) we may refer to them as being the same. But this problem becomes much less difficult in a symbolic language, where many languages have defined an identity operator (usually ===) and an equality operator (usually ==).<p>You&#x27;re right that we have language rules; but many of these rules are arbitrary and mutable in their own right (and do change over time as your previous comment pointed out). The problem starts to come in that language rules are a lot more complex and subject to multiple different (and potentially correct) interpretations.<p>I side with EWD on this one: the interpretation of natural language is going to differ from person to person and as such, building a system that can perfectly discern intent is going to require so much context as to be impractical. It&#x27;s just easier to program a computer using a symbolic language, while building in well understood formal rules to the symbolic languages that cover the vast majority of cases.<p>It&#x27;s not that it would be impossible to develop a general purpose compiler capable of interpreting natural language to machine code; merely impractical. Symbolic languages are much better adapted to these tasks; just as natural languages are much better adapted to conveying uncertainty.",1408997227

While I appreciate the prepared demos that are common at conferences and elsewhere, they are more of a quick way to provide an intro to something new, and I feel they can give beginners the wrong idea about how real programming works. Seeing the whole development process, warts and all, live like this is amazingly educational. Props for doing this Notch!",1408996872

Programmers ARE the human interface to computers, as they are often writing software to specifications created by someone else. Many of the problems arise in the ambiguity of the human-human communication. Another part comes from the lack of specificity combined with different ideas about how to handle unspecified cases. Your idea of what is obvious is not the only one. Some people lack domain knowledge that is assumed in requirements and leads to poor choices where specifications are not complete. In the end, natural language assumes a broad swath of &quot;common sense&quot; that computers do not have yet.",1408996860

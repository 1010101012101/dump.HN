If a goal for the second lap existed - like a permanent moonbase or something like it, it could have continued.<p>As marvelous as the shuttles are, they are just an expensive way to go knee deep in space. LEO is boring because we already went much further. Let's set foot on the Moon once again, and launch from there (using local materials is a good excuse) to Mars and the outer planets.<p>Imagine how big a telescope could be with the lower gravity and how crisp its image with no atmosphere to disturb it or absorb parts of the spectrum. Or a radio telescope shielded (by the Moon) from Earth's radio emissions. And, if something broke, someone would dress up and drive there to take a look instead of taking a year of planning and a billion-dollar mission to, maybe, fix it.",1310151564

2743586,comment,2743585,2743585,1,0,sshrin,,,"OP here.<p>We're an education startup and we want to inspire students to learn programming by making the initial experience fun and engaging.<p>Two key problems that we're trying to solve are:<p>a) Make learning to code fun & interesting:<p>To write interesting code, you need technical skills & domain knowledge. While students are currently taught the basics of programming, the lowest common denominator when it comes to domain knowledge happens to be math and so you have tons of exercises on displaying integers (0 to 100), or printing out the fibonacci sequence etc. This can be boring (not to mention many students already find math to be hard / boring).<p>We're replacing math with social data that students are intimately aware of (ie. their own social data). So on Code Pal, students will learn a for loop by listing the names of their Facebook friends (as opposed to printing out integers from 0 to 100 or some other similar, potentially boring, exercise).<p>b) Enable students to work with real world data:<p>Data in introductory assignments are usually fake and artificially generated. This is a pain for educators (they need to create this data) and it is boring for students. We allow students to work with real data and learn programming in the process. One huge side benefit is that we don't need to tell a student when there is a logic error. For example, if you have 500 friends and your program outputs 499 as the total count, you know there is an error. Another example: we have a Coke versus Pepsi assignment where we teach students the IF statement by asking them to use the number of likes the two drinks have received on FB to determine which drink is more popular.<p>--------\nAddressing privacy: We don't ask for any extra Facebook permissions (except e-mail) and we don't store any data (again except e-mail). We request data from FB every time you run your code (that's the reason we require Facebook login). Also, we don't ask for a stream publish permission and so we can't (and never will) spam your newsfeed.<p>Will appreciate any feedback & feel free to ask questions.",1310150388

When we first set out, we worked with small clients with small budgets, and equally low price expectations. We've grown swiftly over the last 5 years, and have gone from clients with turnovers ~100k to clients with turnovers ~30M. As a result, I've found it challenging to scale my quotes with the clients, as each consecutive project is inevitably with a client larger than the last. In conjunction with the clients growing, however, their needs have commensurately grown, meaning that our costs have likewise increased, resulting in periods of margin contraction as a result of my rigidity.<p>Anyway - my point is that the fact that you raise it as a point of note and deal with it in simple terms of confidence has led me to rather instantaneously revise my thinking on how to cost a build. It's also made me realise that I grossly undervalue my time, and charging the same hourly rate as I charged 5 years ago (for my personal time (on the company books) on consults) is insanity.<p>Thanks!",1310149730

I probably know more about international law than your average domestic lawyer (but certainly much less than a lawyer who actually specializes in international law!).<p>Almost all international law falls into one of two categories: treaties and precedent.<p>Precedent is huge: if you can enforce an otherwise illegal claim for long enough, it becomes established international law. That's why the U.S. military engages in freedom of navigation operations, to prevent excessive claims to territorial waters and airspace from becoming established precedent. Likewise, if you fail to enforce your sovereign rights as a nation, you eventually establish a precedent that those rights are no longer yours, much like copyright enforcement. In short, if other nations let you get away with something for long enough, it literally becomes legitimate.<p>The UN is based on treaties, as are most of the laws of war.  The thing about treaties is that breaking them only matters if someone else has the will and the means to stop you. A <i>lot</i> of people considered the U.S. invasion of Iraq to be illegal, but the U.S. did not become an ""international outlaw"" because, to be perfectly honest, nobody has the means to overtly punish the U.S. for anything.  The U.N. security council can't take action against the U.S. because the U.S. would just veto any anti-U.S. resolution.  Outside the purview of the U.N., the only options for punishing an ""international outlaw"" are censure, sanctions, and military action.  Censure is pretty much meaningless, as PRK, Iraq, Iran, and plenty of others have demonstrated. Any sanctions against the U.S. would hurt the rest of the world economy at least as badly as they would hurt the U.S., so nobody wants that.  Military action against the U.S. would most likely result in more harm to the ""punishers"" than to the U.S, not to mention the damage to the world economy. Basically, the U.S. can get away with anything short of launching overt wars of aggression against peer nations, because nothing else would be worth the trouble of stopping the U.S. The main deterrent against violating the laws of war is the possibility that you might lose, in which case your leadership would be subject to Nuremburg-style trials. If you're in no danger of losing, that deterrent is nonexistent. The only other external reason to follow the laws of war is a quid-pro-quo that you and your enemy will treat each other's POWs well (which, with some notable exceptions, existed on Germany's western front in WWII but not on the eastern front). Of course, there's always <i>internal</i> reasons to observe the law of war, such as societal morals and values, which brings me to my next point:<p>International law is, when you boil it all down, ""might makes right"" restrained by a combination of self-restraint on the part of super-powers, and the rational desire of most nations to avoid costly and destructive wars and protectionism (with regular lapses in this rationality).",1310149629

I am sure you all have had all five piggies counted, pulled, wiggled and tickled to that familiar poem we all heard as kids. You remember don't you?<p>This little piggy went to market,\nThis little piggy stayed at home,\nThis little piggy had roast beef,\nThis little piggy had none,\nThis little piggy cried,\n""Wee-wee-wee!"" All the way home.<p>As startup piggies you want to make sure we are like the first piggy as you go To Market and not be like the fourth piggy who Had None. All too often, we get that big idea and rush to market before we take time to define and measure the market that we are planning to dive in. Rush to market too quickly and you might find yourself in the wrong market or worse yet, find that literally your little startup piggy that went to market ended up as pork chops, ham hocks, hot dogs or sausage or the other pig by products. When that happens that leaves entrepreneurs just like the fourth piggy; left with none.<p>Let's take a look at industry and market more closely.<p>Make sure there are an industry and a market for your big idea. If there is a known industry, then do your market research on the market potential for your idea and when a market already exists it is much easier to predict and share so that others will believe how big the market really is. The Internet, trade associations, the Small Business Administration (SBA), Department of Labor, local business groups, county and state economic development organizations, the library, government reports, market research firms, and market-specific consulting firms are some of the readily available sources of data. Market intelligence, metrics and market segmentation, and support information can help define and quantify the market for your big idea. Your local chamber of commerce and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are valuable sources of market intelligence. When you go out promoting your big idea you want to be received as a well informed expert in your space.<p>If you believe that you must create the market for your startup you will find that effort much more demanding of your time and resources.\nYou want your big idea to have a very big potential. The bigger the market potential the better it is.<p>Netscape founder, Mark Andreessen once put it this way: Ill assert that market is the most important factor in a start-ups success or failure.<p>Netscape was a first big Internet search idea targeted at a market in which there were already big players ready to protect their market presence and offer similar product services as those being pioneered by Netscape. This did not prevent Netscape getting immediate traction in that market space but it did have a bearing on the ultimate outcome on Netscape. While Netscape was not the ultimate winner of the browser wars it understood the market and was a huge success for its founder and early investors.<p>It is one thing to start, support and grow a company and make a name for your product or service, but it is an entirely different thing to create a new market. Markets evolve over time. Whether it is a broad market segment or a niche market that you plan to penetrate, make sure the market exists at all. Consider the impact from market segments that might closely overlap with the market you are addressing. Otherwise your message will be lost or easily duplicated by an established player in the direct market segment or in neighboring markets. Product and service positioning are shaped by the markets in which they are operating. Understanding the market will shape all the early business decisions for your startup. Once you are successful in the market you and your company will shape the decision process of future startups looking to jump into your market. But by then, you will be a market leader.<p>Not all market industries are equal. Consequently, not all industries offer the same potential for start-ups and small businesses. Certain industries present better promise than others.<p>The magazine Start-Up (Summer 2009) provided insight into better and poorer performing industries. They listed the ten best- and worst-performing small businesses (with annual revenue growth of $15 million) by sales growth over the most recent twelve-month period. The best-performing industries were:<p>-Religious organizations (25.1%)\n-Farm products, raw material merchant wholesalers (20.6%)\n-Gasoline stations (15.2%)\n-Support activities for agriculture forestry (14.2%)\n-Direct sales establishments (12.5%)\n-Accounting tax preparation, bookkeeping /payroll services (10.9%)\n-Computer system design/computer related services (9.8%)\n-Offices of other health practitioners (9.5%)\n-Industrial machinery and manufacturing (9.2%)\nSchools and instruction (8.4%)<p>The worst-performing industries were:<p>-Offices of real estate agents/brokers (-12.8%)\n-Home furnishing stores (-10.7%)\n-Lumber and other construction materials/ merchant wholesalers (-8.4%)\n-Automobile dealerships/merchant sellers (-7.3%)\n-Activities related to credit disinter-mediation (-7.3%)\n-Wood products/manufacturing (-6.9%)\n-Motor vehicle dealers (-6.6%)\n-Cement and concrete product manufacturing (-5.7%)\n-Clothing stores (-5.7%)\n-Furniture stores (-5.5%)<p>It comes as no surprise why these industries are aligned as they are, given the overall economy during the measured period. With the housing-credit market implosion, the financial market collapses, and the disasters in the auto industry markets, the worst performing small businesses would come as no surprise to anyone running a business this last year. With gasoline prices seemingly quoted by the hour, worries about personal and professional finances, layoffs and the need for career changes and the like, it was a great period to be pumping gas, retraining Americas workforce, and trying to put your arms around financial investments. Given that the best performing industry was religious organizations, we can all agree that the recent economy has had everyone worried and on their knees.<p>What is interesting, however, is exactly how quickly those good and bad industry segments realigned. Until recently there were always market warning signs and time to react to industry shifts and changes. Today, small businesses have to be prepared to see their industry change dramatically and react to that change with appropriate operational business swiftness. Additionally, we have learned just how dependent on one another many of the market segments have become. When the housing market declines, so does home furnishings, real estate brokers, wood, concrete, and other building materials providers, furniture stores, and financial mortgage providers.\nEven looking at the venture investment market, where current investments are made to market segments designed to have a five-to-ten-year investment horizon, the overall number and total dollars of investments were substantially down from prior recent years. The following industries were still identified in Entrepreneur magazine identified the following market segments as still having favor in the venture capital investment market. Their March 2009 magazine gave us this list:<p>-Software\n-Biotechnology\n-Media and entertainment\n-Industrial/energy\n-Semiconductors\n-Information technologies\n-Network and equipment and...\n...Business products and services, computers and peripherals, consumer products and services, electronics and instrumentation, financial services, healthcare services and retail and distribution were closely grouped together.<p>So let's try that little verse again:<p>This little piggy went to market - Make sure you understand it and that you can be successful in it.<p>This little piggy stayed home - It can be an Internet home based startup but it still needs to be in the right market at the right time.<p>This little piggy ate roast beef - Watch cash flows and have enough to feed your startup. Being in the wrong market or having to create a market will chew up all your ""roast beef"" (funds).<p>This little piggy had none - Avoid being in the wrong market or even worse yet being in the wrong market at the wrong time.<p>And this little piggy cried, ""Wee, wee, wee"", all the way home - Be in the right market at the right time and you survive and you will likely be crying out your success all the way home.<p>Want to read more.

If it did would that make getting the A 'better'?<p>The question relates to the 'game' aspect of success. At Google, for example, when I was there it had a lot of money and not a lot of real[1] projects. So a number of people used gamification as a means of defining success. Specifically they would seek out 'win' such as having their project grow at the expense of others, or create the maximum amount of change in the shortest amount of time, or any number of ways to create a scoring system and then to 'win' based on that scoring system.<p>The insight you had, and I came to later, was that if you're button is 'win' and you take away the obvious 'company gets ""better""' scoring system, people invent their own.I concluded that one of the jobs of 'management' in that scenario, is to help define a scoring system that allows folks who are 'wired to win' be successful and not be destructive to those around them.<p>[1] 'real' in the sense that few projects would make money for the company or cause it to lose money, they existed primarily as science projects to keep the engineers busy.",1310148643

2743457,comment,2741910,2743230,2,0,wtallis,,,"Light travels as both a wave and as particles. Whether you observe light to behave as mostly particle-like or mostly wave-like depends on the circumstances. When you are dealing with very small intensities, you usually observe mostly particle-like behavior (but wave-like behavior still shows up in things like self-interference as demonstrated by the two-slit experiment).<p>If you think that it's unlikely for a photon from a distant star to reach us, then you are simply vastly underestimating the number of photons involved. Consider by analogy the process of smelling something: actual molecules need to fly off the object, travel through the air, and impact your nasal passages in order for you to smell it. That means that anything you smell is constantly dispersing its mass into the atmosphere, but an object can remain pungent for a long time without significant weight loss. Photons are vastly more numerous than olfactory molecules, and carry incredibly small amounts of energy.",1310148591

I can understand why this would seem very important to them, because titles can be strangely personal things, notwithstanding the existence of the naming/branding businesses and so on. I used to work in the film business, and surprisingly enough, you can't (in general) get copyright <i>or</i> trademark protection for movie titles. This is a problem for any writer or producer without the backing of a studio, so in the trade you'll often see references to 'untitled Paul Producer project' - Paul Producer probably has a <i>great</i> title, but doesn't have the resources to stop someone else with more money from from pinching it and launching a marketing campaign year ahead of release. You'd be surprised how often this happens.<p>If you're interested, here's a good article on that issue, though not without a few minor errors: <a href=""http://troygould.com/layouts/50/graphics/handel_la_lawyer.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://troygould.com/layouts/50/graphics/handel_la_lawyer.pd...</a>",1310148421

I would say that the second paragraph of that article agrees with me. I'm interested in understanding how you're reading this that doesn't lead to that conclusion.

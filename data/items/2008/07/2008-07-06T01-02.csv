237487,comment,236808,237168,0,0,robg,,,"Honestly it's not a ""tactic"" for me. I've come up with a workable definition that I'm very comfortable with. Luckily my wife and I mostly agree - and she's Indian. That's good enough for us - my definition doesn't have to work for you. And prayer, for me, is simply finding a stillness in my mind.<p>You're insisting on a set of concepts that never worked for me. So I gave them up. It's still weird for me that this thread is filled with this common response, among folks very comfortable writing their own definitions on a daily basis, but this subject area provokes resistance but not reformation.<p>By ""Nature"", where does that end for you? This planet? Or the solar system? The universe? Or the ""metaverse""? There have been Christian theologians who can be read as naturalistic pantheists. See Charles Hartshorne. Good luck ascribing classical concepts to him, for instance.",1215309508

237483,comment,236808,236976,0,0,robg,,,"I'd say we are already there but the pretty pictures are still very alluring. One example: Consciousness appears to be within grasp with the massive datasets already collected. The problem comes down to explaining, or reducing, consciousness in terms of that data. We might be able to show you what happens in the brain when you see beauty or feel pain, but that explains the experience of neither. The questions remain even as the science is the best it's ever been. I think this reality is much more glaring in modern physics.",1215308673

237479,comment,236808,236941,0,0,robg,,,"You missed my point. The problem with a definition for God is that it would take God to check that proof. That's where dfranke said it ""approaches tautology"" and I agree. We just can't ever be sure that what we come up with is correct or circular. That's faith and humility rolled into one. And it's where I most disagree with Dawkins. His definition doesn't speak for me, and his training gives him no special insight into the problem.",1215308293

I even start halucinating when I don't sleep enough. People can even dream and halucinate under fairly ordinary circumstances.""<p>I was talking about paranormal experiences I've had, such as the ability to predict dates and details of major events. I don't believe that anyone (certainly not me) is ""psychic"" and I can't reproduce this at will, but there have been enough paranormal events in my life that I cannot ignore the likelihood of a conscious will directing the things we consider ""random"".<p>In October 2005, I predicted that I'd meet a girl at a very specific place (a particular coffeeshop) on a specific date, four months into the future, and had a rough vision of her appearance, knew her ethnicity and about six other details about her, all of which turned out to be correct. This ended up leading to a relationship that lasted over two years. There could be a ""self-fulfilling prophecy"" at work, but the mind-boggling number of details that matched leads me to find it unlikely. Although I cannot possibly explain why, I've had 5 or 6 occurrences like this (and a couple that didn't come true). I've also had limited success in drawing on past lives to develop talents that I never thought I had, although I haven't seen enough strength in this department to rule out non-paranormal explanations.<p>Frankly, my opinion is that ""the paranormal"" almost certainly exists, although 99% of it is complete bunk, and the remaining 1% is nearly impossible to control or contain.",1215307324

Some settings don't work this way, of course, but I'm not sure which those would be, offhand.<p>If you're using Python, for example, you're probably also using some framework... for years I used Webware for Python, and more recently web.py.  Both require careful attention to get working in a convenient fashion, in my opinion.",1215307122

Of course, a year later you find out that he also thinks people with dark skin are genetically inferior, and that we should bomb Tehran.<p>For my part, and despite what the avalanche of comments on this thread says to the contrary, I'll assert that it's hard to find an argument more <i>boring</i> and <i>petulant</i> than this one. ""Geeks"" are people who like to take things apart and build them back up again, and vice versa. That is the <i>only</i> thing they have in common.

Get yourself a $20 slicehost account (to start with), add two lines to apache's config to enable FastCGI, then just copy your app up to that server.  That's all there is to deploying Perl, Ruby, and Python these days.<p>With Perl and Catalyst, I can ""make catalyst_par"" and get a file that contains the entire application; including the version of Perl I am developing with.  That way I know for sure it will work when I copy it to production.  (Yes, this means I have to use the same architecture for both development and deployment.  I do.)",1215306674

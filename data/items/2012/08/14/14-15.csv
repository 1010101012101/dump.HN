4381202,comment,4380691,4380691,2,0,bradleyland,,,"This is the core premise of the article: ""What we really need is an Open (Social) Protocol"".<p>I've seen this a lot in regard to App.net. Before I go too far, I want to state my feelings about App.net... I don't have any strong feelings about App.net. I don't ""get it"", but I don't have any strong feelings. I don't care if Dalton wants to try something new. To the contrary, he gets points from me simply for the fact that he's trying something different. Back to the point.<p>The challenge of an ""open social protocol"" is the very nature of such a protocol. Open means anyone can use it. Open means commodity.<p>Email is a great example of an open, ""commodity"" (in the sense that it is interchangeable between providers) protocol. However, email was born at a time when commercial interests weren't paying full attention. The protocols that make up email were adopted in an environment where no one was lining up to monetize email users. AOL was an early attempt, and they almost succeeded, but by the time commercial interests fully arrived, email as an open protocol was already entrenched, and commercial interests have been trying to supplant it ever since.<p>Like it or not, an open social protocol will have to compete for users along side non-open protocols (like Facebook and Twitter). Yes, I'm abusing the term protocol here. Facebook and Twitter are not protocols, but this proposed open social protocol will compete with them. The issue is as clear as mud.<p>From the user's end, these wildly different technologies will compete head-to-head. When a user decides how they'll contact someone, they might decide to post on their Facebook wall, rather than email them. They're choosing a ""closed"" protocol over an open one, because the nature of the protocol doesn't matter to them.<p>When applications developed upon App.net enter the fray, they will compete in the same market, and will be judged by the same criteria. For users, email, Facebook, and Twitter are all free. You could consider that the annoyance of ads is a cost, but they're clearly a cost consumers are willing to pay.<p>App.net is in such uncharted territory that it's difficult to have a focused discussion around it. There are many open questions, some of which lie at the very core: what is App.net? If I have one strongly held opinion, it is that App.net faces some of the hardest challenges one could set themselves against.",1344956303

Even in the realm of aesthetics. Unless those aesthetics are for my benefit only, I am probably trying to get SOMETHING done.<p>And unless the way it works is obvious (bearing in mind that many obvious things are actually untrue, and that many true things are not obvious)... it is reasonable to depend on research.<p>If my art tries to convey sadness but I am so out of touch on how to do that (comic sans) that my peers laugh at me instead, that is likely a failure. If I write a blog post meaning to persuade people to back up their data but rather make people feel content without backups (comic sans), I have failed.

4381184,comment,4379599,4380986,1,0,mherdeg,,,"Yes, I understand your point -- colloquially, one might say that the ""child was lost"".<p>Your mileage may vary, but when someone who works for a company has done something horribly wrong and I'm trying to clean it up, I often find it helpful to be careful with my language so that I can express precisely and correctly what it is that they did wrong.<p>This is mostly a matter of showing empathy, not being a stickler for technical correctness. When I talk to someone who can fix a horrible mistake, and I show that I understand precisely what went wrong and who's responsible without overreaching, I gain credibility and the person I'm talking to (who is after all a person, if perhaps one who has done something horrible) is more likely to believe that I understand them. If I can express that I know exactly how their system works and what part of it broke, it helps them realize that I'm seeing things from their point of view, and this can help bridge the gap between ""my side"" and ""their side"" to help them realize that we're trying to get the same thing done.<p>I've found empirically that practicing empathy with people makes them more likely to try harder to fix mistakes and gets better outcomes. It also saves a lot of time to be able to say ""X happened"", which is exactly what happened, and not waste anyone's time re-explaining the problem instead of fixing it.<p>But, again, this is just a thing that's worked for me in practice (as it happens, mostly with airlines). Concise, precise communication about what went wrong, who's responsible, and what I'd like to fix the problem has helped me get great outcomes dozens of times.",1344956167

4381175,comment,4375199,4375199,1,0,tsahyt,,,"There are a ton of reasons for me not to like Java but on top of it all it's how it clings to ""object oriented niceness"" in utterly stupid ways. It shoves its paradigm down your throat and there's nothing you can do about it. Starting with ""You can't even have a Hello World program without a class"" and eclipsing in the horrid madness that is the Java Standard Library.<p>Don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for OOP as well as for GoF design patterns but overdoing it is - I think - really bad design. Java tries to force you to adapt to this, while for certain tasks a different approach is clearly superior. Some programs benefit hugely from being written in a functional style, others benefit from having purely imperative modules that are <i>not</i> part of a class hierarchy. Java doesn't do any of that and makes it look like a good thing.<p>Again, I don't condemn the idea of OOP, I condemn sticking too closely to one paradigm. C++ is a horrible language in many ways but I still prefer it to Java by miles. Because it's multi-paradigm. Python - multi-paradigm.

4381125,comment,4379599,4380662,4,0,jerf,,,"So, context, I'm a libertarian. But, bear with me a moment.<p>Why are subsidies bad? They ""distort the market"". How do subsidies distort the market? They cause overproduction of the subsidized good. Where an efficient allocation would tend to fairly precisely match demand to production (more precisely than any other known way of doing it), thus allowing the rest of the capital to go do other useful things, a subsidized good overinvests capital into producing the subsidized good, thus producing an opportunity cost to civilization due to the misallocation of resources into overproducing a good rather than doing something else more useful.<p>What is the result of farming subsidies? An excess of food. What is food? Food is one of the fundamental foundations of civilization. No food means total chaos in a matter of days. What does precisely producing 100% of the expected target food production means? It means the slightest bobble in production translates to shortages, and as we all know, shortages happen, and in particular, black swans will happen. A free market does not blindly assume everything will be swell and does build in some buffer against expected disaster, but the buffer can always be exceeded and the free market makes it very difficult for a given producer to make their own buffer larger, lest a competitor eat their market share.<p>Suddenly, a bit of ""overproduction of food"" doesn't sound like such a bad idea. Ideally we'd be storing the excess as much as possible, though regrettably food doesn't store as well as you'd like. Still, I'm actually in favor of a certain amount of food subsidy.<p>The ethanol subsidy is still stupid, and given subsidies may be bad on the grounds of being excessive, or because the interest group has captured the regulator and are managing to harvest the surplus directly instead of via overproduction (which is the result we're actually trying to produce for once), but in general, I'm not actually against a bit of overproduction of the foundations of civilization.",1344955545

A few examples:<p>Stability: For Skype to break, you need to either crash Skype or the entire computer or O/S. For your in-browser conferencing, you just need the web browser to crash.<p>Connectivity: Skype has put huge amounts of work into punching through firewalls, and has many settings dedicated to that. Furthermore it's a common enough option on SOHO/consumer routers to let it through. P2P browser connectivity just isn't there yet.<p>Security: Our firewall at work is configured to allow Skype through. I doubt it's configured to let browsers open direct raw socket connections to any IP and port they please. I can't even begin to imagine how a network administrator is supposed to lock these capabilities down, other than completely disallowing them.<p>UX: Again, Skype is a dedicated program so it can do a lot more. It can keep a little overlay window open in the corner of your screen so you can look at a web page or document but keep an eye on your call. It can hook into the O/S to ensure your microphone is selected and unmuted. It can tell your music player to pause when a call comes in. None of this is possible with a browser (yes, you could add APIs, but where do you stop - are browsers going to become the next JVM, creating a cross-platform API that plasters over the differences between O/S's?)<p>My last point is mildly tangential: Why would P2P in-browser conferencing disrupt Skype / Polycom when it has literally zero perceivable difference to the end-user compared to regular client-server in-browser conferencing (other than the fact that with P2P you will be able to connect to fewer people than in the client-server model)?",1344953561

4380973,comment,4380302,4380424,33,0,runako,,,"Some suggested reasons, to add to the others cited:<p>0. You're obviously speaking mostly about startups that primarily interface with moving money or physical goods. Regulations and infrastructure in these areas are not insignificant operations. US startups working outside these areas (e.g. Facebook, Zynga, Stack Overflow) don't stop at US borders.<p>- Each market has its own customs, language, and tone. Marketing into a new country cannot be an afterthought, or it will not be successful.<p>- Language is a big deal. If you translate your website into German, you create the expectation that your customers will be able to email you questions in German and get help in German. You don't have resources for this unless it is a necessary step on the path to success. Even Stripe's $20mm isn't enough for this: remember that they are competing against very big, rich, public companies like eBay and Amazon.<p>- There is competition at home, in a very large, familiar, homogeneous market. If you are based in the USA and lose the American market, you will likely fail. (In fact, someone could become a competitor by starting the US-only version of your service to take advantage of your distraction.) So you need to win there first. Startups by definition have not won any markets yet.<p>- Non-US markets in industrialized countries are in general not all that big individually compared to the US market. Germany is like 20% the size of the US market; the UK about 12%, and Australia 10%. So it's really hard to get any major additional scale in one country, even after you jump through all the hoops to launch there and service their customers.<p>- US states are <i>big</i> economically. A startup trying to scale can probably get more mileage out of a big marketing push in a single state than by launching internationally. One sample choice: launch in the Netherlands (~15 hour flight from CA, different language, customs, regulations) or make a big push in Florida (~5 hour flight from CA, you're likely already in compliance with all their laws, your website is already in their language, your support staff speaks their language, etc.). Florida's economy is about the same size as the Netherlands'. Texas (~3h flight from CA, 4 metro areas over 2m people) has an economy and population roughly the size of Australia.<p>Startups need every advantage they can get to not take the default startup path (failure). The bottom line is that launching outside the US is not a barrier to ultimate success (your eBay example), but does introduce risks. So it's not often going to be a priority.",1344953499

The reason it isn't news is because it is by far the more common event!<p>So: Do you want to risk a 1 in a million chance of someone tsk tsking at you until you explain yourself to help a little lost girl? If your answer is ""no"" then I think that makes you kind of a bad person, just like those United employees.<p>You could look at it this way: The only way of increasing the perceived probability that an adult talking to a child is just being nice is to increase the number of times that exact event happens.",1344953115

When that became impossible I stopped listening to music.<p>I don't feel I'm asking for so much. TTA support, CUE support, last.fm scrobbling, a decent weighted random dynamic playlist, and the ability to queue tracks, then repopulate the dynamic playlist without disturbing the queue. Is amarok 2 there yet? I know clementine isn't, and won't be as long as it relies on gstreamer (which gives its FFMPEG plugin, which can't play TTAs, a higher priority than its TTA plugin, which can)<p>(I also love the old amarok behaviour where you could type in a search and it would play only things matching the search, and then when you get rid of the search it continues through your whole playlist, but I can understand why the developers would treat that as a bug)<p>(Site is down, so apologies if the answers are obvious)",1344952983

In that respect, like Twitter, even if they promise not to cater to the advertising/user data industry.<p>I guess every company would like to become as indispensable to the internet as TCP/IP. Except that this isn't how it works - it has to be open and easily reproduced in order to become a thing like TCP/IP, which hurts monetization.",1344952908

If it's true, it inevitably reflects on the managers. If not, well, the complainer is blaming others for what are probably his own problems.

I can recall stealing my father's old college calculus book out of the the top cabinet when I was in third grade and reading through it at night when I was supposed to be asleep, purely out of boredom with the math we were taught at that level. By then, I barely had any concept of a variable, and yet I somehow managed to teach myself a decent portion of calculus in the next three years.<p>These days, I struggle to apply that level of effort to anything I'm <i>required</i> to do.",1253525232

834263,comment,833635,833974,0,0,movix,,,"I would say that in the end, it's all about the user experience, and that unfortunately or not, comes from the design.<p>The cleverest app, or piece of coding is useless if the user doesn't get what they want from the experience of using it.<p>Brilliant design doesn't have to be flashy or clever, and of course, the simplest interfaces are always the best. There is a huge amount of skill and intelligence involved in taking what is a potentially complex idea or concept, and expressing to the user, not only how to use it, but also what the app is capable of, in a simple, graphical way.<p>There's been a of of discussion on HN about the new Sequoia site. I think I'm one of the few who think it's brilliant, because it already assumes a lot about its users, and that if they're on the site, they probably have a pretty good idea already of why they're there. The site is tailored to those people, they don't need to be hand-held with descriptions and explanations. This would be completely out of place in many other instances, but the designers knew their users, and what their needs were, so built accordingly. The web is a graphical interface for information, great design is crucial.<p>The OP made the point about a team...my point is that this has to a be a balance of skills, each member understanding their value and importance to the project, and understanding and valuing the importance of their colleagues. Teams made up of entirely one skill set will never be as productive as one with a wide range of skills.",1253524986

834261,comment,834074,834074,0,0,billswift,,,"""The Amish"" is on overgeneralization, since there are different communities who use different amounts of and with different rules about ""modern technology"".  They are also not adverse to technology as such, at least most aren't.  What they object to is being tied to the outside world.  Which is why they use much gas or kerosene powered equipment, but not electrical power lines, the tie is still there but is less direct and nagging.  They also are more willing to use outside technology for business related purposes, many shops and businesses have phones, they won't be in their homes though.<p>As for the paper, I think they may be able to put it online, for printing out in each community, the internet is no more binding to the outside than the postal service is.  But there is no real likelihood that most Amish would be willing to get internet connections to their homes.",1253524854

Rock stars are quintessentially style over substance.  Sure many of them are competent musicians, some are even very good, but that's pretty incidental to their rockstardom.  A rock stars main job is to look the part and sell the brand while others do the heavy lifting.  That seems almost the opposite of what you'd want in a programmer.  What you really want isn't the rockstar, but the virtuoso guitarist who is always kept slightly in the background but is the main reason why the rockstar sounds so good.",1253524614

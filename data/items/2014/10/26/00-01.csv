8509946,comment,8509500,8509625,0,0,joesmo,,,"I think you can easily say the same thing about every single amendment in the Bill of Rights. Might does indeed make right and usually might is money. While the article points out that making deposits below 10k is not illegal and while that maybe technically correct, just like many things that were not explicitly illegal in the Communist system could harm one greatly, many things that are not strictly illegal in the US can harm one greatly. I think we need to start looking at things another way.<p>For lack of better words (though I&#x27;m open to suggestions) it is essentially illegal in the US to travel with cash, make deposits under $10k, or really, anything the government authorities deem to be illegal vis a vis money that can be taken via civil forfeiture laws. If one can&#x27;t run a business or even save for his children&#x27;s college without fear of losing the money to the government, what then is the difference between our system and that of authoritarian regimes if both systems are not ruled by laws but by the greed of police and government agencies?",1414284994

They supply cash to the treasury, people think up cool ideas and try to implement them.<p>So Google is really a trust fund combined with the charities it supports? Either what you&#x27;re saying is right and Google is a very bad business, or wrong, and Google is excellent at hiding its nature from its own employees (I suspect that both of these are true, to some degree).<p>> Do you think Johnny Ive, when designing the Apple Watch is concerned more with the business side of how they&#x27;ll up-sell different watch bands to make money, or do you think he is absolutely focused on delivering a product experience that is fantastic and that if they do a good job, the business will do well?<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter what Johnny Ive or some product manager at Google are focused on, or what their intentions are. The history of business, politics, and the world, really, is full of people focusing on doing a job, but all the while advancing a different goal altogether -- whether they mean to or not (this emphasis on intent is a common theme with Google in particular; Google seems to think that if your intentions are good then no bad can come out of your actions, even though there&#x27;s no reason to believe that&#x27;s the case, and plenty of reasons to believe the very opposite).",1414284991

8509943,comment,8508478,8508916,0,0,saurik,,,"The goal of the tool &quot;strings&quot; has always been to dump the strings table of a binary object. It happens to also have a mode that lets you try to find random strings-like content in any file. It happens to default to this mode if it can&#x27;t parse the file as an executable. People thereby have gotten somewhat used to using this tool to having this functionality at hand, and use this tool a lot of this purpose.<p>This is not, however, the actual goal or purpose of this tool. The fact that many people use Perl as nothing more than a slightly better version of sed doesn&#x27;t mean that Perl&#x27;s ability to write complex object-oriented software is &quot;over-engineering&quot;. You just don&#x27;t know what this tool is actually for, which is OK, but means you can&#x27;t judge whether or not it is &quot;over-engineered&quot;.<p>BSD, apparently going back to at least BSD 4.3, also had a strings tool, and it did the exact same thing: it parsed binary files to dump their strings table. Apple&#x27;s strings tool has no code heritage from the GNU version, instead being a vague descendent of the one from BSD 4.3. This is how this tool has always worked: stop being part of the noise trying to turn this into a GNU-bash fest :/.",1414284920

I can see people not thinking anything is wrong while they are going through the experience, but I really can&#x27;t find anyone that I know, at least, who thinks high school was a worthwhile experience.  And who hasn&#x27;t had that feeling of relief at the beginning of summer break, and that sick feeling in the pit of their stomach when summer was over?  Or recognized immediately on the first day of college that a student actually can be treated like a person, not an inmate?<p>I recall sitting in a college class that had a recent high school graduate in it, and he raised his hand asking if he could use the washroom.  The instructor just looked at him and told him that he is in the real world now, and doesn&#x27;t need to get permission for a normal bodily function.<p>Of course, you might be right, in that I probably spend too much time reflecting on something from 25 years ago.  It is the main reason that I don&#x27;t put up with BS from people I work with -- had enough of that from school teachers.  But it is possible that it affected me bad enough that I could probably use some counseling about it, if it is considered normal to just forget about what high school (and junior high, to an extent) was like.",1414284847

It isn&#x27;t necessarily to start making money from customers before the product is ready—although being willing to pay for something in alpha is probably a good viability indicator its not the only one.<p>Many games aren&#x27;t treated like products but more like hobby or art projects. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing but it does mean an MVP isn&#x27;t really necessary or helpful. Many games do things that achieve the same results of an MVP:<p>1. Screenshot Saturdays. This puts the idea in front of people even if the thing is buggy, broken or just unplayable.<p>2. Festivals. User testing during festivals was incredibly valuable and helped us determine what attracted players to the booth, what they enjoyed about the game, what was fun, what wasn&#x27;t, etc. Here the game doesn&#x27;t need to be finished.<p>3. Awards. Similar to festivals, an award can indicate that you&#x27;re on the right track. The inverse isn&#x27;t necessarily true. Winning an award does not equate to market viability.<p>4. General social media, spreading the word and press. If someone is willing to talk or write about your game that&#x27;s a good sign.<p>5. Steam&#x27;s Greenlight: Will people vote for this?<p>6. Steam&#x27;s Early Access: Will people buy this before its finished?<p>7. Kickstarter. A very time consuming and potentially expensive endeavor that might work for MVP-like launches. Will people contribute money to the possibility of this game existing?<p>The point of all of these is to get out there with the game as soon as possible, even if its not ready, to test out the idea.

This is partially true.<p>But we already know that we all can&#x27;t be winners, and most ideas will be losers anyway. In our subgroup of grinders, I don&#x27;t know that there is a significant statistical difference in the outcome vs the normal population of startups.

It doesn&#x27;t have a compulsory garbage collector, it doesn&#x27;t have a compulsory complicated IO manager, it doesn&#x27;t have a compulsory multiplexed threading system. In some circumstances lacking any of those will be a downside, of course, but not having it built-in and compulsory means Rust gains flexibility. In several ways, there&#x27;s actually lower overhead with Rust, because it is a modern language designed around the advances and research that has happened, e.g. dynamic (de)allocation can be faster due to putting some sizedness requirements on the very lowest level APIs (which one rarely calls directly, so the programmer will never notice the restrictions, just the improved speed).<p>My comment was trying to address the Go <-> C <-> Rust bridge, pointing out that C and C <-> Rust are essentially the same, other than the extra code one must have from writing in two languages rather than one. If one was to forgo the C (which is possible, Rust can easily be used to write a library directly exposing a C ABI), there won&#x27;t be much difference at all between C and Rust.<p>In summary, in future, any restrictions required would not be very significant, and, even now before Rust&#x27;s runtime has been excised, the restrictions will be things like &quot;no network IO&quot;, one still gets access to all sorts of fancy iterators and data structures without requiring any runtime.<p>†Strictly speaking, this isn&#x27;t quite true right now, but there is a concrete plan currently being executed to make it true.",1414283216

8509852,comment,8508478,8509669,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> There are a ridiculous number of serious vulnerabilities in C code related to lack of bounds checking and manual memory management. This isn&#x27;t really opinion so much as fact. I understand what you&#x27;re saying, but you&#x27;re also downplaying the seriousness of C bugs relative to <most other languages> bugs.<p>I feel like &quot;<most other languages> bugs&quot; tend to get ignored because it&#x27;s not popular to blame <language> for bugs unless <language> is C. For example an enormous number of high severity CVEs are SQL injection but I never hear anybody saying we should replace SQL with a binary interface that clearly distinguishes statements from data, even though that would make more difference in practice than replacing C with something else.<p>> I don&#x27;t follow. What&#x27;s the equivalent of forgetting to check the length of an input string before chugging it into a too-small array in Go?<p>In Go the program terminates, which is <i>at best</i> a denial of service vulnerability. If the program is anything in the nature of Fail2ban then just causing it to die is a serious problem. Meanwhile when it restarts it will have to somehow deal with whatever corrupted state the crash left behind, which depending on the context can provide the attacker with opportunities to do arbitrarily bad things by manipulating the state to be something the programmer never anticipated. Being able to induce a restart is a huge increase in attack surface.<p>Immediate program termination is the &quot;take cyanide capsule&quot; solution to serious bugs. It may be better than some of the alternatives but it&#x27;s still <i>very bad</i>.",1414282302

Pascal was widely used in commercial product development (DOS/Windows), Modula-2 was scarce, but taught at universities with high quality development environments available for many platforms and the Oberon OS was based on the language Oberon, which was heavily influenced by/derived from Modula-2.<p>Everything necessary to produce safe, maintainable, fast software was available back then, but lazy/uneducated/stubborn people used C instead and wrote crappy software we still have to use today.

In fact, it will make you scratch your head a lot and will make you do a mental js-coffee conversion each time. You might end up liking it, but I think that clojurescript is the better bet here for performance gains as well as better coding in general, since its focus on functional programming is more concrete and inherent in it. Functional programming in coffeescript is exactly the same as in js ie. GIGO",1414282238

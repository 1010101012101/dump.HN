Which is all poetry really is in the end!<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.<p>“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
      The frumious Bandersnatch!”<p>He took his vorpal sword in hand;
      Long time the manxome foe he sought—
So rested he by the Tumtum tree
      And stood awhile in thought.<p>And, as in uffish thought he stood,
      The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
      And burbled as it came!<p>One, two! One, two! And through and through
      The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head
      He went galumphing back.<p>“And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?
      Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!”
      He chortled in his joy.<p>’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
All mimsy were the borogoves,
      And the mome raths outgrabe.",1427792340

Not to everyone&#x27;s tastes and some people used headphones, but it meant no one tried to talk over desks, and if people needed to speak it set the tone as one a bit like a library.<p>The office I&#x27;m in now (20 people) is much the same. We don&#x27;t have any music, but through a strong example set by the founders and a culture of being able to ask people to be quiet politely and without repercussions, regardless of who it is, we have a very quiet working space and conduct most conversations over IM or in separate meeting rooms.<p>Based on my experience in the other offices, I can see why many people would be against open offices, but I believe they can be done well.

9295044,comment,9294533,9294533,0,0,chestnut-tree,,,"It&#x27;s interesting to read this from a UK perspective. National rail services in the UK have been privatised for many years and all national rail services are run by private companies. Most of the UK rail franchises are European owned (Deutsche Bahn, Nederlandse Spoorwegen, Abellio, SNCF). MTR own 50% of of the London Overground rail franchise - one of the better run rail services.<p>Overall, privatisation has been a disaster for the UK rail industry (in my opinion). Despite the fact that we have some of the highest rail passenger numbers in Europe, we also have the highest fares in all of Europe and poor to mediocre services.<p>Our rail services are incompetently (and greedily) run and the political will to change this is depressingly weak (across all political parties).",1427792005

And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read

The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal these words appear:

    I passed by the garden of the old Imam
    And lo, in the garden, in the shade of a jasmine,
    There with a pitcher in her hand stood Emina.

    What beauty! By iman I could swear,
    She would not be ashamed if she were at the sultan’s!
    And the way she walks and her shoulders move...
    -- Not even an Imam’s amulet could help me!

    I offered her salaam, but by my dīn,
    Beautiful Emina would not even hear it.
    Instead, scooping water in her silver pitcher,
    Around the garden she went to water the roses.

    A wind blew from the branches down her lovely shoulders
    Unraveling those thick braids of hers.
    Her hair gave off a scent of blue hyacinths,
    Making me giddy and confused!

    I nearly stumbled, I swear by my faith,
    But beautiful Emina did not come to me.
    She only gave me a frowning look,
    Not caring, the naughty one, that I am crazy for her!

On the other hand I got excited about recent advances in Deep Machine Learning (and frameworks like Caffe, cxxnet) because with these new advances and tools it is possible to solve problems which we had absolutely no chance previously.<p>Also it is pretty standard for me that the stuff I do at the workplace is relatively boring, and the stuff I do at night by myself is exciting.",1427790862

For one person to be or become an expert in all would be unreasonable, at least for a standard mortal. Depending on your particular inclinations, different areas may be more or less suitable for exploration. There is also the question of specialisation versus broad-oversight, as well as that of making custom components versus using ready-made ones. Some particular areas to consider are:<p>(a) Vision systems, which further subdivides into hardware and software components. The industry could use some better performing cameras (think low-light, high frame-rate) with reasonable prices, so that is one area needing development. Popular software systems, such as the open source OpenCV, definitely need work.<p>(b) Audition systems. Since there is already quite top-notch audio hardware available at reasonable prices, I opine that the software side is more in need of serious help, particularly in the areas of speech recognition.<p>(c) Vocalisation systems. More natural and emotional voice-production systems would be nice, particularly if available open source.<p>Note: Both audition and vocalisation have open areas for less-popular languages. These systems really ought not be limited to English.<p>(d) Basic mechanical systems, which subdivides into functional and aesthetics. There is certainly room for improvement here.<p>(e) Electrical systems, such as wires, motors, and relays. There are also interesting developments here such as synthetic-electric muscle fibres -- both mechanical and electrical.<p>(f) Testing. Like many other complex systems, there is often a need for testing.<p>(g) Psychology. If the machine interacts directly with humans or other animals, there is an element of psychology involved, even in simple systems such as automated tellers.<p>(h) Environmental impact, both in production and deployment.<p>(i) Security. If the system is accessible to the public in one way or another, then security probably matters.<p>(j) Artifical intelligence and other broad-level perspectives. This area is related to game AI, and it applies to both robots and fully-virtual systems alike.<p>... And quite a few other areas.",1427790800

If you don&#x27;t place faith in past statistics then you&#x27;re willfully ignoring the best means of predicting future behavior.<p>In addition, OpenBSD has <i>far fewer</i> lines of code, and the most reliable correlation with security holes is lines of code. Simply by having fewer LoC, OpenBSD is already statistically less likely to contain a security hole.<p>> chain of trust<p>Yeah, with microsoft your chain of trust is microsoft employees and the word of other people reverse engineering the code (e.g. the people who said the _NSAKEY thing was legit after reverse engineering a small portion of the code).<p>With OpenBSD your chain of trust includes me, the developers, and other eyes that have looked at the code. The &quot;many eyes&quot; theory is not flawed. It never stated that having many eyes eliminates all bugs, merely that it&#x27;s better to have more eyes than fewer eyes and increases the chance a bug is noticed. There&#x27;s no sane way to argue against that statement unless you turn it into a ridiculous strawman of &quot;many eyes means heartbleed couldn&#x27;t have happened QED&quot;.<p>> Am I to believe that the NSA gagged with thousand or so developers who work on windows, or just the 10 who manage OpenSSL<p>It&#x27;s much easier to believe that the NSA could gag one or two of a thousand developers than one or two of 10. Believe me, you don&#x27;t have to get all MS employees to futz windows security. Just getting one at random already gives you a decent probability of getting a kernel level exploit, and selecting five or so specific employees can get you a hell of a lot more.<p>> the &quot;NSA paid/forced MS&quot; boogeyman<p>Evidence in this post-Snowden era indicates the NSA has worked to backdoor commercial software. It&#x27;s also quite possible heartbleed was an NSA inspired hole, though I don&#x27;t think that would be a productive discussion to have.<p>If you read leaked NSA slides and look at what they have done (such as the Verizon MITM closet) then backdooring operating systems is not a bogeyman, it&#x27;s quite reasonable.
You cite that they have intercepted data without the consent of the parties involved, but that ignores the fact that they also coerce parties as well; just because they have used the tactic you mention does not mean it&#x27;s the <i>only</i> tactic they use.<p>If you&#x27;re going to argue that BSD is no more secure than Windows and the NSA is not in fact using gag-orders and subverting software you&#x27;ll need a heck of a better argument.",1427790761

  Hat der alte Hexenmeister 
  Sich doch einmal wegbegeben! 
  Und nun sollen seine Geister 
  Auch nach meinem Willen leben. 
  Seine Wort´ und Werke 
  Merkt ich und den Brauch, 
  Und mit Geistesstärke 
  Tu ich Wunder auch. 

  Walle! walle 
  Manche Strecke, 
  Daß, zum Zwecke, 
  Wasser fließe 
  Und mit reichem, vollem Schwalle 
  Zu dem Bade sich ergieße. 

  Und nun komm, du alter Besen! 
  Nimm die schlechten Lumpenhüllen; 
  Bist schon lange Knecht gewesen: 
  Nun erfülle meinen Willen! 
  Auf zwei Beinen stehe, 
  Oben sei ein Kopf, 
  Eile nun und gehe 
  Mit dem Wassertopf! 

  Walle! walle 
  Manche Strecke, 
  Daß, zum Zwecke, 
  Wasser fließe 
  Und mit reichem, vollem Schwalle 
  Zu dem Bade sich ergieße. 

  Seht, er läuft zum Ufer nieder, 
  Wahrlich! ist schon an dem Flusse, 
  Und mit Blitzesschnelle wieder 
  Ist er hier mit raschem Gusse. 
  Schon zum zweiten Male! 
  Wie das Becken schwillt! 
  Wie sich jede Schale 
  Voll mit Wasser füllt! 

  Stehe! stehe! 
  Denn wir haben 
  Deiner Gaben 
  Vollgemessen! - 
  Ach, ich merk es! Wehe! wehe! 
  Hab ich doch das Wort vergessen! 

  Ach, das Wort, worauf am Ende 
  Er das wird, was er gewesen. 
  Ach, er läuft und bringt behende! 
  Wärst du doch der alte Besen! 
  Immer neue Güsse 
  Bringt er schnell herein, 
  Ach! und hundert Flüsse 
  Stürzen auf mich ein. 

  Nein, nicht länger 
  Kann ichs lassen; 
  Will ihn fassen. 
  Das ist Tücke! 
  Ach! nun wird mir immer bänger! 
  Welche Miene! welche Blicke! 

  O, du Ausgeburt der Hölle! 
  Soll das ganze Haus ersaufen? 
  Seh ich über jede Schwelle 
  Doch schon Wasserströme laufen. 
  Ein verruchter Besen, 
  Der nicht hören will! 
  Stock, der du gewesen, 
  Steh doch wieder still! 

  Willsts am Ende 
  Gar nicht lassen? 
  Will dich fassen, 
  Will dich halten 
  Und das alte Holz behende 
  Mit dem scharfen Beile spalten. 

  Seht, da kommt er schleppend wieder! 
  Wie ich mich nur auf dich werfe, 
  Gleich, o Kobold, liegst du nieder; 
  Krachend trifft die glatte Schärfe. 
  Wahrlich! brav getroffen! 
  Seht, er ist entzwei! 
  Und nun kann ich hoffen, 
  Und ich atme frei! 

  Wehe! wehe! 
  Beide Teile 
  Stehn in Eile 
  Schon als Knechte 
  Völlig fertig in die Höhe! 
  Helft mir, ach! ihr hohen Mächte! 

  Und sie laufen! Naß und nässer. 
  Wirds im Saal und auf den Stufen. 
  Welch entsetzliches Gewässer! 
  Herr und Meister! hör mich rufen! - 
  Ach, da kommt der Meister! 
  Herr, die Not ist groß! 
  Die ich rief, die Geister 
  Werd ich nun nicht los. 

  &quot;In die Ecke, 
  Besen! Besen! 
  Seids gewesen. 
  Denn als Geister 
  Ruft euch nur, zu seinem Zwecke, 
  Erst hervor der alte Meister.&quot;</code></pre>",1427788825

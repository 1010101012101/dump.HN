The amount of ignorance on Hacker News is outstanding.<p>For crying out loud, if you&#x27;re going to use historical examples, at least get it right damn it. You&#x27;re _trying_ to cite project COINTELPRO as a reason to fear the government, sure, whatever.

You do know at least the different agencies that the US Government law enforcement / intelligence community are composed of, right?<p>Anyway, FBI keeps files on Americans, because that is their damn job! NSA cannot, and not only are they legally not allowed to, they do not have the infrastructure to actually keep individual tabs on Americans. The FBI is in charge of the fingerprint database. The FBI is in charge of the genetic database.

That&#x27;s why you won&#x27;t find many transplants from big cities in SF, but instead lots of people from tiny Midwestern and Southern towns that moved to SF for work.  So of course everyone in SF thinks the city is amazing; for most people there, it&#x27;s the best place they&#x27;ve ever lived.<p>Try living in New York or LA, or even a smaller city like Boston/Seattle/Portland/Austin, and suddenly SF seems like an over-hyped bubble full of insecure people.<p>Regarding the &quot;maker culture,&quot; I feel like I heard this myth a lot.  In my view, SF&#x27;s culture is becoming the boring valley office park culture.  SF is packed with 20-30 y.o. single white and Asian males.  Not the cool, eclectic city it was once know for, SF now feels awkward and boring.  And again the most frustrating part of that is everyone is convinced they&#x27;re living in Paris, but better cause &quot;we&#x27;re all entrepreneurs!!  Looks how smart we all are!&quot;<p>The comments about public transportation are laughable.  SF is a joke.  Even if you include the whole Bay Area&#x27;s mediocre train systems, SF is a poor example of public transportation, even for the US.  The BART makes one pass through a single corridor of the city and stops running at midnight.<p>Other cities around the size of SF: Indianapolis, IN.  Fort Worth, TX.  Columbus, OH.  Charlotte, NC.

The problem is that with callbacks, the function decomposition is forced on you based on what needs to be done asynchronously (i.e., mostly I/O).   As a result, it breaks apart the flow of control into little tiny pieces that may be only loosely coupled with the most logical way to decompose functionality.<p>So your statement may be true in general, but it may not be applicable when it comes to how to best handle callback functions.",1376750943

Do the developers of lua concern themselves much with this? I suppose slightly, but mostly in the form of documenting what&#x27;s different and how to convert old code to new code.

6229177,comment,6226964,6228806,1,0,the_bear,,,"Chrischen is right. Maybe I&#x27;m not using the term correctly, but I think of &quot;plans&quot; as meaning multiple different tiers that a user can choose from. Mailgun previously had plans (i.e. you had to pick which tier you wanted) and now they don&#x27;t (i.e. there is just one tier that applies to everyone).<p>Some characteristics of plans that I don&#x27;t like:<p>* Passing some arbitrary limit (# of contacts, # of users, # of files, etc)  triggers a steep increase in price, rather than having the price gradually increase as usage increase. For Mailgun, usage is the number of emails sent. For us, it&#x27;s the number of users on the account.<p>* Because of the steep price increases at arbitrary points, some users get a lot more value out of the software than others. With Highrise (another CRM) an account with 5,000 contacts pays $24, while an account with 5,001 users pays $49/month. Both accounts are getting roughly the same value, but one is paying twice as much as the other.<p>* Most SaaS companies with plans force users to choose which plan (or tier) they want when they sign up. How would a user know what features are worth paying for when they haven&#x27;t even tried the software yet?<p>* Plans are often used to upsell existing customers after they&#x27;re locked into your service. Salesforce has a plan that is cheaper than my company&#x27;s price ($5/user/month vs. $10/user/month) but it is limited to the point of being almost useless. I&#x27;ve talked to many people who got suckered into a 1+ year commitment with them only to realize they&#x27;d have to pay $65-$250/user/month to get the functionality they needed.<p>* Customers have to monitor their usage to make sure they don&#x27;t trigger the next tier. It&#x27;s just one extra thing to worry about every day, and businesses have enough on their minds without worrying about unexpected price increases.<p>Having said all of that, I&#x27;m currently struggling with how I might go about offering more products than just a CRM without making it look like a tiered system. I don&#x27;t consider it to be the same thing because they really will be additional products (project management, invoicing, etc.) which are generally completely separate subscriptions if you use a different company&#x27;s products, but I want them to be integrated/bundled directly with the CRM to make the user experience as simple as possible. Still not quite sure how to pull this off. Pricing sure is tricky.",1376749947

If you put your head down and work hard, taking no vacations, until you&#x27;re age 65, then you flip 180 degrees in the other direction and retire into a life of full-time leisure. So if you live long enough, it really won&#x27;t be a waste; you cash it in all at the end!<p>Also odd is the flip at the other end of the scale. You live your childhood, go to college and don&#x27;t need to think much about career and then all of a sudden you get sucked into the cycle (graduating from college.) I was working from an internet cafe in the Philippines the other day (my connection at home was down and I needed to knock some stuff out) and while I was busting my ass the the kids (late high school and college aged) in there were playing games or checking Facebook. Occasionally there is someone in there working on homework.<p>The economy here in the Philippines sucks. These kids will graduate from college and be lucky to make minimum wage, which is $5 - $6 per day. A good job where I live in the Philippines is a call center position which pays something like $300 / month. Of course, the call centers require that you have a college degree. Even a lot of cashier positions at the local stores require a college degree. Because labor is so cheap, it&#x27;s not uncommon to walk into a small store and see a half dozen workers behind the counter where in the U.S. you might only see one or two. That doesn&#x27;t mean the service is better though. ;)<p>So, talk about slavery. I want to tell these people who are going to college and playing online games during their off-time that they are being conned. They are wasting their time going to college and then wasting their free time thinking college will bring success. What they really need to be doing is exiting the system and plowing their own path. There is nothing preventing them from doing what I do, sitting right next to them making in one day what they might make in a month.

There were frequent gaps of up to three weeks with no commits.  It was my New Year&#x27;s resolution to ship stuff, instead of jumping into learning something new every two weeks.  Each of those long periods of time could&#x27;ve been a great time to start something new.   I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel and I owe it to myself to keep pushing.",1376748675

6229109,comment,6221077,6222799,2,0,anifow,,,"The way I see it, political power grabs are simply a continuation of wealth accumulation. Money is limited in its value, but it&#x27;s the best universal proxy for value that we have so people often equate them. It&#x27;s better to see money as path to things that are actually valuable, such as food, water, shelter, and the ability to provide these for others or to hire them to do things.<p>If you think about wealth in this abstracted sense, a notch away from money, then you can see how basic trading dynamics might apply.<p>Yakovenko modelled the trading dynamics in a perfect game of chance (coin flips determine winners and losers). Something interesting emerged.<p><a href=""http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/12/7/075032"" rel=""nofollow"">http://iopscience.iop.org/1367-2630/12/7/075032</a><p>What it shows is that if everyone starts with the same amount of money, after a bit of random trading, their wealth is normally distributed (this is obvious if you are familiar with the binomial distribution). A few people are doing well, a few are doing badly, and most people are around where they started. As the trading continues though, it turns into a power curve where most people are doing badly and a few are taking everything. Its the same thing that happens when a rich man sits down at a poor man&#x27;s poker table. He can keep putting him all in on every good hand and he only needs to be right maybe 1 in ten times and he wins everything. There&#x27;s a runaeay effect after you hit a certain point.<p>Of course, things are a lot messier at this higher level interpretation of wealth since its harder to attach numbers to wealth in the form of political power, good health, and other factors which have a compounding effect (good health and political power help you make more money, but they cost money, so there&#x27;s a feedback loop, but you xan equate them for simplicity). This is why people complain about a shrinking middle class.<p>The good news is that human life is messy we often allow our relationships to balance things out. The bad news is that we have gotten better and better at sterilizing our social and physical environments so the past might not predict what&#x27;s coming next.",1376748353

The NSA is tasked with strictly foreign surveillance&quot;, but I wanted to be pedantic since the debate on NSA surveillance seems to take surveillance of foreigners as something completely natural and in no way wrong.<p>But honestly, assuming we get to a point where the US government has a file on every American citizen, does it really matter if the file is with the FBI and not the NSA? Of course the rules and laws covering the two agencies are different, but ultimately, it doesn&#x27;t seem like the US government is very interested in strictly following the law.",1376748177

Others are working on similar projects.<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether this applies to liamzebedee&#x27;s concepts (haven&#x27;t read enough yet) but may apply to the trsst scheme: I just want to point out that there are really three problems to be solved:<p>(a) prevent unintended parties from reading messages - this is handled as well as can be (as far as we know in the present state of things) by strong encryption. It also requires avoidance of reliance on third parties such as CAs.<p>(b) correct identification of intended interlocutors - I believe the CA system, and any central-&quot;authority&quot; system, are worse than useless for this. The only alternative that has a realistic chance at the objectives is a &quot;web of trust&quot; based on side channels, individual judgments about who&#x27;s who and who&#x27;s controlling their own keys correctly, and watching keys and behavior of parties for consistency over time.<p>(c) obscuring who&#x27;s talking to whom.  If Alice publishes something on trsst, encrypted for Bob, it may be unreadable by anyone but Bob (assuming &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;b&#x27; are sound) - but if the adversary Nancy has extensive, sophisticated powers throughout the network, then Nancy may be able to track the posting of the message to Alice and the reading of the message to Bob.  Then Nancy can track them down and coerce their secret keys, trojan their PCs, or &quot;disappear&quot; them (not in USA, you say? wait for it).<p>If I&#x27;m reading this correctly it handles (a) and (b) to some degree but I&#x27;m not sure it addresses (c).",1376748011

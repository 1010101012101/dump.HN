6382014,comment,6379272,6381817,2,0,benjamincburns,,,"It depends on the size of the capacitor. And even with smaller capacitors, any device which is capable of producing a signal strong enough to overcome even a simple passive 3dB filter well enough to get through the USB handshake, let alone actual device operation, would almost certainly be quite large as compared to a regular charger.<p>Adding an inductor would screw with things, but if we&#x27;re being <i>really</i> paranoid here, active circuits can measure the resonant frequency of the line and overcome it. Or, even if we&#x27;re not being paranoid, you&#x27;ve now given someone a nice RCL trampoline to bounce a nice high current into your phone&#x27;s USB data lines.<p>There are a few ways to protect against all of that if you want to be really paranoid. To start, you could go with a higher order active filter built from a cheap op-amp circuit.<p>More complex varieties could include the use of a tiny 8-bit uC programmed to control a digital pot on the protected side, and an optoisolator somewhere in there just in case there&#x27;s some weird failure mode which causes a signal path to short from protected to unprotected. The benefit of something like this would be that the controller could also control a light or buzzer to alert the user when a signal is detected on the &quot;unprotected&quot; side.<p>Cheapest and most reliable might be to pump the output of a simple RC high-pass filter into a simple RC low-pass filter (translates to DC bias) then feed that to a comparator which latches the signal lines open (and sounds an alarm) if signal is detected. Or better yet, make it normally open and close only when signal isn&#x27;t detected.",1379095196

(It&#x27;s my understanding that it only contains 2GB). So that one is rightfully dismissed.  Well, other than that you get more benefit from ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) with a 64bit virtual address space. Still not a headline-feature, though.<p>It&#x27;s also commonly mentioned that AArch64 defines twice as many general purpose registers, each twice as large. AArch64 also defines twice as many FP registers  again, each twice as large  available to the SIMD unit.  The camera in the 5S does a lot of image processing in order to try to take the best one-button picture possible, and there is probably a lot of opportunity for SIMD code behind that.  So that might be a big win that is directly tied to user experience.<p>Also mentioned, but less frequently, is the kind of optimizations a programming language runtime implementor can do when 64bits are available.  For example: <i>Apple has apparently taken advantage of the 64-bit runtime in Lion by optimizing the Objective C runtime itself to use some of these extra bits for, shall we say, clever purposes. Bavarious describes an optimization through which Apple is able to replace previously full-fledged opaque objects such as NSNumber with an object-placeholder that exists entirely as the 64-bit object address itself. This means that, for a wide range of simple objects, no additional memory allocation is required, and no retain/release memory management is required for the object.</i><p><a href=""http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1947/bit-hacking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.red-sweater.com/blog/1947/bit-hacking</a><p>(I assume a future version of Dalvik could take advantage of similar tricks.)<p>AArch64 also adds cryptography instructions for AES and SHA-1/SHA-256.

But for reasons I gave earlier there&#x27;s an effort to maintain balance between resources expended for those above, ad below, the mean. This effort isn&#x27;t always successful -- I&#x27;m speaking of a principle that isn&#x27;t always a fact.<p>> This is evidenced by the number of children failing high school. Approximate figures are: 25% for US, 5% for wealthy northern european countries.<p>That&#x27;s true but low IQ isn&#x27;t necessarily the reason. There are other reasons -- a lax attitude toward education, anti-intellectualism in society as a whole, poor social discipline, and others. There are some results suggesting that bright kids drop out of school at high rates -- almost as high as the average dropout rate -- unfortunately the data aren&#x27;t very reliable.<p>This study (PDF warning): <a href=""http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1356&context=doctoral"" rel=""nofollow"">http://digitalcommons.liberty.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?articl...</a><p>Says: &quot;Out of all high school dropouts, as many as 20% of them may be gifted (Renzulli & Park, 2000);&quot;<p>If that were true, then the gifted dropout rate almost equals that for average kids. But when we read the referenced article (PDF warning): <a href=""http://www.sagepub.com/bjohnsonstudy/articles/Renzulli.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sagepub.com/bjohnsonstudy/articles/Renzulli.pdf</a><p>We don&#x27;t see the quoted figure, only references to other sources for a figure near 20%, but nothing reliable.<p>I say this because I don&#x27;t like throwing figures around that have no reliable basis. All I can say is there seems to be some anecdotal evidence that bright kids drop out in numbers nearly as high as average kids.<p>There&#x27;s another way to approach this -- we can look at adult achievement, although the link with IQ is problematical. Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Richard Branson, and many other well-known figures in society are (a) evidently gifted, and (b) dropouts from high school or college.<p>I have to say I was surprised to discover there&#x27;s no readily available, reliable IQ breakdown for dropouts. There are a huge number of psychologists, many unemployed or underemployed ...<p><a href=""http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/10/219372252/the-most-and-least-lucrative-college-majors-in-1-graph"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/10/219372252/the-most...</a><p>... many of them studying really silly things, but none of them have taken this issue on, in spite of its importance.<p>But I don&#x27;t think the case can be made that those to the left of the IQ average are being unfairly treated, compared to the average or the gifted.

That is, he effectively wants an identity equation for every moment of time in the application.<p>This idea that &quot;state&quot; is somehow hard to reason about is one that I am growing to reject.  Sure, if it is not part of the metaphor that one has built, it can be tough.  But this is also true for what many of us mean when we say &quot;mathematics.&quot;  What is the equation for how you get home every day? How do you calculate what represents you yesterday?<p>Look at some of the classic algorithms.  Is quicksort really that tough to reason about because it is in place (and thus relies on mutation)?  Bubble sort?  (Any sort...)<p>Is cleaning your room or office truly difficult to reason about because it involves modifying the room?  Fixing dinner, since it involves modifying the ingredients?<p>This is what I loved about that paper linked up thread.  When you build your abstractions around the ways in which things interact by mutations, then the code gets much clearer.  This is not because we wall off the mutations, but because they are given names and reasoned about.  It is not that we constantly have new instances of a list or collection with the old one hanging around, as that can be just as problematic as otherwise.<p>Consider, sure this is an obvious error to a casual programmer in Java:<p><pre><code>    String x = ...\n    x.toLowerCase();\n    doSomething(x);\n</code></pre>\nBut, why is this a mistake?  Wouldn&#x27;t it be MUCH more intuitive if you wanted to keep both values the code would look like:<p><pre><code>    String x = ...\n    String original = x;\n    x.toUpperCase();\n    doSomething(x);\n</code></pre>\nJust from a communication perspective.

Great brands have a logo that can be reduced to one color, not only for faxing (as the blog post mentions) but for embossing, stationery, signage, and many applications that would be overly costly when printed in multiple colors.<p>The change happens to coincide with the &quot;flat&quot; trend, but I see it as a necessary evolution for a brand that has grown into the mainstream and requires consistency across different media.<p>Of course the logo itself leaves something to be desired, from the genericness of the concept to the strange and inconsistent perspective of the flaps. But remember, it&#x27;s not just a logo, it&#x27;s also an icon that sits in your dock or toolbar. As a software company it makes sense for Dropbox to have a logo that can also be a functional and iconic UI element -- another reason why 1-color makes sense.<p>Dropbox much like Google acquired its customers through utility, not by having a great logo. It will be a hard fought battle to make &quot;the box&quot; symbol synonymous with Dropbox, but if they can own it, it&#x27;s certainly a powerful mnemonic.",1379092023

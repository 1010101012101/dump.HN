4179331,comment,4175646,4179106,2,0,dmbaggett,,,"I agree that a so-called dynamic language like Python is at something of a disadvantage because it must make atomicity guarantees that lower-level languages like C need not.<p>I still don't think it's reasonable to conclude that typical programmers are fine with their threads not really running in parallel, or that the GIL isn't worth bothering to fix, even though fixing it would be hard. In my original post yesterday, I pointed out that as the language footprint has grown, Python's disadvantage in this respect has increased: it is much harder to remove the GIL now than it was in, say, the 1.5 era when there actually was a (problematic) GIL removal patch.<p>We've gotten way off track, but the original point I was trying to make was that 1) the GIL really is a problem for not-purely-theoretical programs written by competent developers, and 2) that the 2->3 transition, by complicating the language and increasing the workload for the alternative implementations, has made it less likely than ever that the GIL problem would be resolved.<p>And, indeed, Nick explicitly confirmed this by saying the GIL is basically a dead issue for the CPython devs. His post made many good points about the merits of the 2->3 transition, and in particular pointed out some ways that 3 has reduced work for the alternative implementations, but I remain unconvinced overall. And not out of ignorance or incompetence, as he implied.",1341007121

That aside, I think you're making a good point.<p>Part of the promise of the information age is general cognizance of the fact that we live in an incomprehensibly vast and complex universe, and that we are only able to perceive the most infinitesimal mote of it during our lives. With the judicious application of technology, we can expand our perceptions many times by accumulating information from different parts of physical space. For thousands of years, it was possible more or less to pretend that there was nothing else in the universe outside this room, and no one else alive but your family; thanks to the internet, that is purely impossible today.<p>It should not be surprising that this frightens some people.<p>Technophobes frequently protest that assisted communication can't have the value of face-to-face speech, which is frankly complete horseshit. Most of the in-person conversations that most people have most of the time are more banal and purposeless as the front page of Reddit (or 4chan, depending on your peer group). What is important is the relationships that we have with other people, and I've seen nothing in my experience or the literature to imply that relationships are intrinsically less meaningful because they are not communicated in person.<p>This sentiment is a form of forceful control exerted by those who have no other reason to command attention but proximity. This is also crap; attention is a product of interest and respect. If I am not interested by what you are saying, you will not maintain my full attention for long; and if you demand my full attention for no other reason than that you happen to be the human being closest to me in physical space, neither will you my respect.",1341007109

One of the major issues I've experienced is that project management tools are great for new features but don't work so well for handling bugs. Silo is planned to have three main features 'Fix, Build, Maintain' which all work in slightly different ways. And your're right if you have to use a second tool then the benefit of the first is radically diminished.<p>You're also right in that the 'basecamp killer feature' isn't clear. Why am I going to switch to Silo? The marketing website needs to work a lot harder to convey the benefit. It is somewhat abstract at the moment. We need to really hammer out the product before we can really sell the killer features and benefits.<p>As for <a href=""http://flashissue.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://flashissue.com</a> - I love the tagline 'Do you hate creating newsletters?', it instantly caught my attention and got me listening.

The same is true for Ruby on Rails.<p>Most frameworks almost feel like they're tuned to solve these basic problems and give a fantastic first impression that doesn't sustain.<p>Developing a complete project in each is a better way to move forward IMHO.",1341007016
4179322,comment,4178487,4178487,2,0,jules,,,"We will still need a way to pass information between applications, but that may be so different from the concept of files that it would be ridiculous to call it files. For example applications on the internet exchange information via APIs. Microsoft is doing something similar with Windows 8: if you want to get a photo into an application you show the user a menu to get a photo. The user gets a list of all his photos to pick from. Where this list comes from is dependent on which other applications are installed: if you have a facebook application you can choose your photos from facebook, if you have picasa then you can also choose photos from picasa, etc. This works because each application that has photos is supposed to provide an API to the OS to access its photos. Exchanging information by exchanging it directly via standardized APIs makes a lot more sense than exchanging it via an abstraction layer designed to operate on top of a hard disk. This is similar to the difference between Unix pipes and getting the output of one program, storing it on your hard disk, and then reading it in with another program. With the API model the disk loses its special status, and instead becomes just one other data source/sink like any other (FUSE turned on its head, if you will).",1341006996

If you give app devs access to the FS, they will all use that because it's easier and avoids the challenges of supporting cloud storage. However, this is ultimately worse for the user experience in the end.<p>I get what you mean about only wanting certain documents on Drop Box - that was just a limited example. The spirit of the concept is that the developer can choose what cloud storage to use based on the application.<p>In the case of a mobile Photoshop app, Drop Box might make sense.

4179298,story,,,18,25,person_to_blame,"Why I added a ""Peson to Blame"" field to our bug tracking system",,"So a few days ago I added a ""Person to Blame"" field to our bug tracking system and this decision has attracted a lot of attention from outside of our organization.  I totally welcome the debate and love the passion from everyone.  Given the interest, I thought I'd share how the ""Person to Blame"" field works for our team.<p>We are a tight-knit dev team, part of an almost-3-year-old startup.  As a team, we spend a lot of time together and just like other startups, we probably spend more time with each other than with our families.  We only hire people who we respect and take pride in the team that we have built.  We are a shop that believes in peer code reviews, unit testing and open debate.  We also hold each other accountable when we do silly things.  For instance, if you break a continuous integration build you drop a $1 in the jar for our beer fund.   Oh, you also get a nice dose of tongue-in-cheek lashing from the team if you write a time bomb into our unit test suite.  All in all, we have fun together, we push each other to be great and we respect each other enough to be direct and honest.<p>About 6 months ago, we made a conscious effort to reshape our software development process in preparation for Continuous Deployment.  We promote an environment where developers are in charge of a story from start to finish.  This includes understanding the problem, thinking about how a story needs to be tested, implementing the solution, writing the necessary unit tests and functional tests, and ways to measure the effect of the story once in production.  As soon as a developer okays the story, it's included in the next release.  In short, we want to be a continuous deployment shop and we think that we have the right developers to do it.  (to be clear, we are still a few months away from the true continuous deployment process like the one installed at Etsy)<p>More than just tools and process, continuous deployment requires a different kind of mentality.  While the throw-my-stuff-over-the-fence mentality never existed on our team, we do need to introduce a higher level of responsibility and accountability from everyone on the team.  Since the shift about 6 months ago, we have seen an increase in the number of hot-fixes going out between deployments.  And that's okay, bugs happen. We anticipated the increase in production bugs when we moved away from having a dedicated QA team.  But, as we get closer to having a true continuous deployment system in place, we need to start treating production bugs as the exception rather than the rule.  Bugs are inevitable and are accounted for in the world of continuous deployment, but bugs should still be avoided if possible. So a few weeks back, I started talking about keeping metrics on production bugs: count per sprint, per developer, per team, etc.  I mean, you have to start tracking these things so that you can improve, right?  And to keep the accounting simple, I added a ""Person to Blame"" field to Jira a few days ago.  Could I have named the field something more politically correct, so that feelings don't get hurt? Sure.  But what's the fun in that?  The point was to bring awareness to the number of production bugs after each release so why not throw in a small dose of public shaming for good measure? And to be clear, the purpose of the field, and ultimately the purpose of the metric, is not to pinpoint the cause of the bug.  Shit happens and we have better things to do.  The ultimate purpose of the metric is a reminder for each developer to be better everyday.<p>Like I said in the beginning, I welcome the debate on the matter and appreciate the passion from everyone.<p>The ""Person to Blame"" Boss :)",1341006718

It's entirely possible for a connection or a family of connections to bring down the server software, which often provides a way to subvert the OS while the machine is in the unusual state of the userspace server software being down. This provides the avenue.<p>>  if everyone was using it as a desktop OS, and was browsing, checking email, etc, there is more of a chance to attack it<p>I think this falls down, too: Linux has never been a single monoculture. Instead, there's been broad de fact standardization of some things but not others, making it more difficult to target malware to it, as malware is, very often, intimately dependent on not only specific software, but specific configurations of software and specific versions of software.<p>Also, <i>Windows has never had a trusted source of software comparable to distro repositories.</i> This is probably partially due to antitrust rulings, and the fact Windows caught on and had its first major flowering before Internet access was especially cheap or reliable (consolidating usage patterns around a non-Internet shrinkwrap software model). This means it's hard to get all the software you need from trusted sources unless you act like a distro maintainer and decide for yourself who in specific you trust. (You can do that in Linux, too, but you don't <i>have</i> to.)<p>Finally, Windows users complain about UAC. Linux users don't complain about sudo.

I needed a good laugh today.<p>No, Apple has not blacklisted a developer's certificate that we know of to the extent that pre-existing apps on an arbitrary user's phone will stop working due to validation failure, but they have revoked certificates from developers that effectively prevent them from ever submitting another app to the store[1]. You're right that sandboxing is a stronger security measure in a general sense, but security isn't a black or white thing you can throw a single buzzword at and have all your problems taken care of. Code signing is an additional layer of protection for the average user so he/she doesn't download a fake AV program that grinds their device to a halt while offering to get rid of itself for the low price of $39.99. Yes, code signing also ensures that the manufacturer of the device can also get a cut of the profits of other people's hard work, but that is not it's only reason for existence and it doesn't always have to be employed as a revenue stream.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/11/07/apple-exiles-a-security-researcher-from-its-developer-program-for-proof-of-concept-exploit-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2011/11/07/apple-e...</a>",1341004675

It doesn't use notes or other securities for transactions, only cash. Let's pretend that the bank also self-insures those holdings (which basically means no insurance).<p>Okay, so I compromise the bank's security, take every bit of cash. I disappear to some island in the Pacific with every last cent.<p>How badly is the bank screwed? How badly are the customers of the bank screwed?<p>Actually, not that badly. I only wiped out the bank's reserves. That means both the bank and its customers have a short term liquidity problem, but not necessarily a significant asset problem.<p>A regulated bank would have 10% of all deposits in its reserves. Unregulated banks often have far less, but let's pretend it is 10%. The bank loses 10% of its value. If it can stay solvent, then nobody loses any money, but it might take a few days before people can make withdrawals (which could cause a bank run, but that's a whole different problem). If the bank <i>can't</i> stay solvent, it goes bankrupt, and depositors become creditors. It'll take a while to resolve the legal process, so liquidity is killed, but when it all ends, depositors are going to get back something close to 90% of their money back.<p>The key thing is that the bank lends out most of the money it takes in. Even if you rob the bank of all its cash, the bulk of the ""assets"" of the bank are all the IOU's from lendees, which is value that is really hard to ""steal"", because lendees tend to only pay their lender, and then tend to do so in installments over a great deal of time.<p>THIS IS WRONG: Hacking Coinbase would be more akin to hacking say Visa, and redirecting all payments to you instead of the intended merchant.... if Visa's transactions were all cash based, instead of credit based... and Visa was unregulated... and even then it is kind of different because Visa is a middle man between two banks...<p><i>UPDATED</i>: Okay, I just read they are actually storing the bitcoins in the cloud, rather than just exchange the coins between the two parties....

4179070,comment,4178487,4178699,5,0,Periodic,,,"It's a little more than a key-value store.  The keys are impure.<p>One of the first issues is that the disk likes to work in terms of blocks, which tend to lend themselves to arrays, preferably of fixed size so that related data is contiguous.  This leads to a limit on the number of files in a directory and so nesting directories is one of the easiest ways to contain more files.<p>But it's also a little more than that.  Directories can group semantically related files together.  This means their meta-data is in the same directory inode and so can be read in as a group.  This creates more efficiency.  Chances are that you'll often access many related files at once, even if it is just to list a directory, so it helps the file system to have some structure so that the meta-data of related files is all read in at once.  It's an optimization that takes advantage of our own semantic information to structure the data.<p>This arises from disks being a really crappy way to access data.  They are slow and work best with sequential reads of large amounts of data.  It really isn't that useful for a persistent key-value store whose meta-data alone may be much larger than the amount of available memory.<p>But I tend to think of it as a KV store most of the time anyway and often wonder why we have the silly idea of directories.",1341003646

In fact, sometimes you can inadvertantly enter into a negotiation...<p>Once I was called into my boss' office, complimented on my work, and offered a salary raise.   I was caught off guard (there was no big project that I recently completed or anything), but managed to contain my glee.  In light of all the nice things my boss just said about me, I asked for a bit more then they were offering, negotiated a bit, and walked out with a nice deal.<p>Later I found out that there was a rumor around the office that I must have been interviewing and that's why I had been coming in a little later and wearing fancy clothes.   Really it was just that I had a new girlfriend who worked at a high-end clothing retailer (discount!), and lived a bit further out of town (thus coming in later).",1251457023

More parts will be coming - other parts of life has just been interfering :) If you ever feel like trying your hands at making any changes, it's on all on Github.<p>At the moment I'm just focusing on getting attr_reader and friends working. Sounds simple, but since I wanted to write attr_reader and attr_writer mainly in Ruby it's a rabbit hole that required me to get basic parts of Symbol and String working, as well as define_method, fixing various method dispatch issues, fixing string interpolation and more; those changes will make up the bulk of the content of the next couple of parts I write. Once all those pieces are in place a lot of the rest of what's needed to compile a fairly decent subset of Ruby is pretty simple (though lots of gruntwork). With some luck (and enough spare time) I hope to get the compiler self-hosted by the end of the year.",1251454726

Seriously, though, this bit right here:<p><i>Split visitors up according to source where they come from, returning visitors get different treatment as search and social media users</i><p>is not exploited NEARLY enough.<p>If you own a Wordpress blog, there is a plugin called What Would Seth Godin Do, which shows new visitors to your blog coming from search engines a discrete customizable prompt to sign up to your RSS feed.<p>You can expand on that general idea.  Do you display advertisements?  Do you display them to everyone equally?  Do you have any reason to think that is optimal?  Try splitting your users into two groups -- the community you've built (who are your core fans and spread your stuff) and transients (someone who just arrived off a Google search and, most probably, won't stick around).  Nobody in the core fan group clicks on your ads, since they come there for you and not for AdWords -- so turn them off, and enjoy the increased visitor loyalty and spreadiness.<p>Many people in the Google search group are looking for something not on your page -- the AdWords ad (and Google) gives them a second bite at the search apple.  Show them the ads.<p>This will result in vastly higher measured CTRs and higher quality traffic (no misclicks from core users who were aiming for something else), which will make your advertisers happy and <i>might well be revenue maximizing</i>, while making your regular users love you even more.<p>P.S.

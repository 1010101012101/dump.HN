107991,story,,,3,6,inklesspen,"Ask YC: Best solution for offline access to a webapp?",,"Our company is developing a rewrite of our flagship app, which has historically been a Windows product, as a web app written in Ruby on Rails. So far it's gone moderately well; our complaints lie mostly with ActiveRecord (so bloody limited) and the lack of documentation of how to write good tests for complex models.<p>However, it turns out that our webapp also needs to be usable when the customer has no internet access. (Perhaps this should have been taken into account when the CEO decided to do the webapp idea, but we're pretty well invested into this approach now.) About 25% of our potential customer base would require this; another 25% would like to use it but do not require it. We sell access to our app as  software-as-a-service to health-care agencies, so if they need to have offline functionality, they need to have it; it's not just a preference.<p>These are the alternatives I and a few others have come up with, but I'm hoping some YCers might have some advice.<p>* Google Gears: Seems to require substantial rewrites to our app.<p>* iPhone version of our webapp: our customers don't have much money to buy iPhones and service plans. also, some of our customers need to do work with the app in places where there is no cell phone service, let alone wi-fi.<p>* Joyent Slingshot: The basic architecture (local install of Rails, with some extra code to transfer data between the local install and the webapp) seems sound, but Joyent seems to have abandoned Slingshot halfway through rewriting it. If we go with this approach, we'd probably implement our own version rather than struggle with Joyent's unsupported code.<p>* Slingshot-esque with eee: Provide a custom install for the ASUS eeePC that launches the user directly into our app, with Slingshot-like methods for transferring data between the eee and the webapp.<p>* Slingshot-esque with VMWare: Same as above, only we provide a vmware image instead of an eee install.",1201895605

It generally stops a couple dollars short of the buyout price. At this moment, Yahoo is trading at $28.25, still low enough to make a sure-thing couple of bucks per share. It's a gamble though. If the deal falls through, or gets blocked by the government, the buyee's stock price drops back down to where it was before the offer .",1201894810

Yahoo and Microsoft were the established giants. After 5 years or so the situation has almost reversed, though, with Google making (and buying) the killer apps and the other two players stuck in a game of follow the leader.<p>In 2007,
Microsoft's net income was: $14 Billion.
Yahoo's net income was: $660 Million.

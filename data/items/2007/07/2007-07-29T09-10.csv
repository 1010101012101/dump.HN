 - with java script clients , a language where few people have the required skils
 - A non deterministic rending system for the UI with archaic postbacks 
   - A back end which is also badly dated
   - an inefficient protocol that sens 10-13 bytes of data for each byte if you need to send binary data .. or you need to encode it. 
   - A slow and polluted UI . as marketers push flash etc into pages as well as browser addins
   - Security issues due to the browser architecture itself. <p>For a limited number of companies who can afford to hand craft their javascrips ( ie not ASP.NET / server components) and who need broad reach Web 2.0 is good , but for most enterprises its a poor solution. Delivering java /.Net apps to your clients is far cheaper / more maintanable model with betetr user experience. <p>I have had a look at Silverlight(WPF/E ) and it seems to have much better rendering/performance and be more elegant but its from Microsoft. <p>Regards, <p>Ben <p><p>",1185702868

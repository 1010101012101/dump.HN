Particularly Sorkin's book, which I've heard negative things about.<p>I'm about 2/3 of the way through _All The Devils Are Here_ by Joe Nocera and feel like it's doing a brilliant job of addressing the shortcomings for Sorkin's book, which I felt maybe sacrificed some accuracy for the sake of building an enjoyable narrative. _Devils_ also has an interesting structure, different than the others; it's a catalog of sketches of the different people/forces/companies that went into the mess, so you get a chapter on the guy who started Ameriquest, and a chapter on Fannie's struggles against the Bush administration, and a chapter on how Goldman's IPO and Merrill's cultural mismatch to trading culture caused them to screw up the market. It's great reading.",1291607966

You currently appear to have domain renewals done shortly in advance of need, with manual scheduling.  <i>This is a source of risk.</i>  There are a <i>lot</i> of failure modes there, including ""my registrar fubars the renewal"", and many of them have unpleasant consequences.<p>Domain names are cheap and abandonment is infrequent and unlikely to save much money, for most people on HN.  So renew them early, for long terms.  For your business or blog or other domain which will be a going concern for the foreseeable future, go renew it for ten years.  If your business gets sold to Amazon tomorrow, oh well, that cost you only $60 ~ $80 or so.<p>I own a small stable of domains (a few dozen) and keep most of them on rolling two year registrations, with my main ones (product sites, my blog, etc) on rolling five year registrations.  I renew all of them yearly.  This way, screwups by myself, my bank, Paypal, or GoDaddy probably won't deprive me of use of my property.",1291607790

Of course, I am not a lawyer, nor is this legal advice.<p>1) this is a super loophole for founders.  In a new entity, which costs $250 and 1h to set up yourself online, invest $100 to buy your founders shares.  Hold for 5 years, sell for $10mm, save $3mm in taxes.<p>For an entity with multiple founders, I would spend more and get real legal paperwork done, but for a one man corp at an early stage, just be competent.<p>2) vc investments are not going to benefit, but angel and friends and family can.  Biggest issue is no easy way to do convertible debt, but if you want a priced round, go for it.

One might also use this for a studio model business, where e.g. each iPad app is a separate corp and may sell independently.<p>IMO they really didn't think through the consequences of ""greater of 10x the basis or $10mm"" in the context of founder shares purchased for a trivial amount.<p>Personally, if you meet the above requirements for an investment, you owe it to yourself to pull any 2011 or 2012 in corps forward to q4 2010.

It is a common attribute of many top CEO's in any industry.<p>As an outsider looking in, I perceive Jason's value to a company may be found both in his skill to identify valuable people and to market the company he is involved with through his personal exploits.  Sometimes, companies work well in spite of the leadership they have as staff comes together to form and execute ideas.<p>At Weblogs, Brian Alvey and a slew of talented people pushed both the platform and the content to form a successful company.  At Mahalo, iteration after iteration drives the product while a revolving door of staff comes and goes.  Jason's latest projects including his video podcast network and independent startup conference are further examples of time and trial.  On the surface, Jason's value has been to identify the right people and use each company as a platform to market himself and then his role within the company.<p>This history is somewhat unusual and confusing when compared with traditional employers.  Especially for those that Jason prefers to hire.  Young, fresh out of school, energetic and bright, Jason leverages his abilities to identify talent in order to ""scoop"" people who can trade their time for the chance to work for a true online legend.  In many cases, it's a fair trade.  However, when looked at from afar, Weblogs, Mahalo, This Week In and TechCrunch tell an interesting story that may make those with more experience, knowledge or connections think twice.  ""To each his own"" is a valuable sentiment conveyed well by Travis in the original post.<p>Beyond history, I have learned to judge powerful people with a simple measure of good vs. evil.  When given the opportunity, some people unknowingly make decisions that have a positive impact on the people and processes around them.  Others feel more comfortable operating somewhat negatively while justifying their path by saying things such as, ""I make the hard decisions"" and ""I'll fight until the last breath"".  There is no right or wrong way to make decisions but the impact of those decisions on the people and processes around them uncover what type of person they are.<p>With my definition of good vs. evil above in mind, and using Mahalo as a specific example, Jason can be viewed as evil.  It's not always easy to do, but I strongly believe that working with people who are fundamentally good produces happy, healthy, engaged employees who truly care about the success of their company, it's culture and their leadership.  Working for people who are evil produces a turnstile of employees who typically last less then 3 years at their desk and require regular additional extra curricular motivation in order to offset their frustrations.",1291605870

Stuff happens. You need them. \n  -Motorcycle parking\n  -Chair budget. Get what you want/need to work best\n  -I liked Pixar's office/cube budget, although I've never worked for them, search for it. \n  -Ability to have whatever keyboard/mouse/display/computer best suited me. Don't make me use the shitty company's logo mousepad if I want something else. Don't force an IDE on me. If I use textmate, allow me to use that. If I'm a vim or emacs guy, allow that. Results matter- not my IDE. \n  -Give me a software budget, or better yet no budget at all. If I want software that is tangentially related to my work, I should be able to get it\n  -Massive company library. Geeks love books/knowledge. Being able to take these home is good. Being able to order anything and add to it is even better. \n  -Food and drinks available. \n  -Cabs home if needed- no questions asked. \n  -Ability for me to receive packages at work (that may not be work related). When I have an office I *always* ship my packages there as to not miss them. \n  -I loved being able to do laundry at betahouse. \n  -Encourage and pay for employees going to social events, even if they aren't 100% tied to their daily work functions. Social employees are worth much more.\n  -A 'quiet room' where someone can work/study/sleep without being bothered. A nap/dark room is a good idea too if you can fit it space-wise. \n  -Your office layout matters. Think how you position people and how the arrangement of power sits. I liked sitting right beside the CEO at my first startup (and we were 20 people, so this wasn't a given). I count him as a good friend because of this. \n</code></pre>\nBut also, don't skimp on basic benefits either. Make sure everyone is financially sound. If someone has something they need bailed out of, let them know you are there. The last thing you want is some employee worrying about the bills from replacing a major appliance that blew up at home. Issue small loans, or better yet, convenient bonuses on a need-only basis. Make sure your employees are healthy. Find out what they actually feel about their health insurance. Most younger employees will not care, but a few will. Listen to them. You want them healthy and happy- their families too. Most companies these days skimp on partner healthcare and no longer support the needs of a family.<p>Other small things that we miss now in society do matter to people.<p><pre><code>  -Anniversaries, birthdays and important dates to that person.

The Kindle is pretty terrible for textbooks or other things used purely as references (some people supposedly <i>read</i> texbooks, I don't).<p>2. The Kindle isn't too bad for technical books that you actually want to read, but aren't going to use as references. For example I bought the Kindle version of Douglas Crockford's <i>Javascript: the Good Parts</i> and read it front to back without much issue. Code formatting was my greatest concern, but its not too bad. Sometimes when a code block flows between pages and you want to flip back and forth it can be a little annoying, but overall not much worse than having to turn a physical page back and forth. It can also display PDFs, which I used to read Robert Love's book about Linux Systems Programming. The PDF display functionality isn't the best, largely because it can't re-flow text to make things a good size. But as long as this isn't the main reason you want the Kindle, its not that big a deal.<p>3. The Kindle really comes into its own for books of pure text you just want to read front to back. My biggest gripe is that a lot of books in the Kindle store seem to have been scanned in with pretty terrible OCR (some books are perfect, but in others its comment for a '1' to be used in place of an '1' or 'i', or for some reason for 'F' to be used in place of 'I'). Since I've been in College I haven't really done much recreational reading, but the Kindle has really gotten me back into it. Since I received it about 10 days ago I've read a Tom Clancy book, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Javascript: The Good Parts, Red Planet and the Robert Love Systems Programming book (the name escapes me at the moment).<p>The real value of the Kindle (or really any e-reader, the Kindle just happened to be really cheap and reputable) to me is the instant delivery of books. When I want to read something, as long as I have Wifi (didn't get the Whisper-Net-whatever-version) I can find something to read. Even better, Project Gutenberg has a huge collection of free Kindle-formatted ebooks. I can't normally be bothered to go to a store to pick up a book, or even wait for one to be delivered, and I don't like reading off of a computer or phone. But when I can instantly have a book on a great screen, and even have a huge selection of free ones, suddenly I find that I can't stop reading.",1291604968

By my reading, ""mistakes made by doctors"" applies to the ""Medical Errors"" row in the table at the top of that page.  98,000 deaths per year is horrible, but it's about 0.0319% of Americans.  Granted, that's per year; let's assume you have a 0.03% chance of being killed by ""Medical Error"" every year of your life: with an average lifespan of 80 years, your odds of being killed by ""Medical Error"" are 1-(.99968^80) = 2.5%.<p>Now, there are two caveats, other than the (necessarily) very rough nature of the above calculation.  First, you may believe that some of the other categories in that row are also things that would be reduced by reducing doctor independence.  ""Unnecessary procedures"" seems like a reasonable candidate for this, though I would assume that since Medical Error is its own category that it tries to be fairly inclusive.  Second, you may believe a different number for medical error itself:<p>""We could have an even higher death rate by using Dr. Lucien Leape's 1997 medical and drug error rate of 3 million. (14) Multiplied by the fatality rate of 14 percent (that Leape used in 1994 (16) we arrive at an annual death rate of 420,000 for drug errors and medical errors combined. If we put this number in place of Lazorou's 106,000 drug errors and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) 98,000 medical errors, we could add another 216,000 deaths making a total of 999,936 deaths annually.""<p>Side note: Is it just me, or does the author sound <i>hopeful</i> that we might be able to add to the death toll?<p>If you believe that 420,000 number (about 4x higher than what's in the table), that'd be about 10%.<p>Did you get ""1 in 3"" by attributing all iatrogenic deaths to doctor error?",1291604584

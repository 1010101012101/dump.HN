Other people are working 8+ hours a day, so I should be too.</i><p>What I learned as a writer is, focus on output, not time-spent or schedules met.<p>Set yourself a daily goal, but from there, be flexible in how you achieve it. When I was still writing, I&#x27;d try and aim for about 2k words a day, usually done off and on, but if I had an off day I just let it happen and took whatever break I needed to let the creativity come back in its time.<p>The thing is, the traditional work day is lousy for creative professions (and I count programming among these). It is a construct born of factory work, and you can&#x27;t produce a quality creative process under factory conditions.<p>Give yourself a break, and let the mind take the respite it needs to get spinning again. I recommend taking a look out for John Cleese&#x27;s insights on creativity and the creative process, he has done some lectures and videos on the subject that should be findable on Youtube, and they&#x27;re  very valuable insight into the different pressures of a creative field versus a &#x27;production&#x27; one.",1423756798

9039341,comment,9035549,9037815,0,0,mightybyte,,,"> I get the point, but I still feel like the problem surface is not really reduced that much by static typing it away<p>Ok, that&#x27;s a valid point, which means that we need to precisely characterize what is meant by &quot;problem surface&quot;.  Let&#x27;s continue with our IpAddress example.  Imagine you are the author of the IpAddress package.  Imagine we have an IpAddress type accompanied by an API of say 15 functions that take an IpAddress and do something with it.  How many of those functions need to have tests that cover the case of passing None?  I believe that number represents our problem surface.<p>If you agree that this is the problem surface, then I can confidently say the reduction is dramatic.  (If you don&#x27; agree, then I refer you to the previous point about Maybe making it very clear what needs None tests.)  The Python IpAddress package has to have None tests on every single function that takes an IpAddress.  The Haskell package has to have None tests on zero.  It only needs the equivalent of a None test on the functions that return a Maybe IpAddress.  This is going to be a very small number.  This brings us to your other point.<p>> Additionally - it might just be my python bias talking - but I tend to find that most useful &quot;real-life&quot; libraries need to have an opinion about what happens when a variable is None, because it is almost always meaningful. I guess if I were writing haskell my code would end up looking like a bad carly rae jephsen song :)<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is indeed largely caused by your Python bias.  In my experience, Haskell code does not end up littered with Maybes.  I think you don&#x27;t appreciate the full weight of the statement that when you have an IpAddress, you <i>never</i> need to worry about the None case.  Never ever.  Period.  There are cases where you need to deal with a Maybe IpAddress.  Those cases don&#x27;t end up polluting all your code, contrary to what you seem to think.  In fact, it&#x27;s the other way around.  The pure cases tend to be the ones that are the most common, making the Maybe cases clearly visible.<p>Even in the situation where they do start to pollute some things, Haskell gives you dramatically better tools for dealing with the problem.  Yes, you&#x27;ll still have to have a test for it, but the code you&#x27;re testing will have been much more concise and less prone to error.  Furthermore, Haskell can make it so you don&#x27;t even have to think about testing that case.  You write an Arbitrary instance for IpAddress and the Arbitrary instance for &quot;Maybe IpAddress&quot; comes for free!  This means that your QuickCheck test for the Maybe IpAddress function will automatically be sure to try it with Nothing.<p>From what you&#x27;ve said it is clear to me that your python bias is somehow making it hard for you to see/believe the benefits that we&#x27;re talking about.  I&#x27;m concerned that this gap seems to be so big and we seem to be having such a hard time crossing it.  Give Haskell a try and see for yourself.  But don&#x27;t go off into a cave and play with it alone.  There are abstractions and best practices for dealing with some of these things that took awhile to emerge.  So you should be sure to talk to people who have experience using them while you&#x27;re learning.",1423756756

9039326,comment,9035549,9037443,0,0,tel,,,"As the post I linked labors over, &quot;type&quot; and &quot;type safety&quot; have particular, well-defined technical definitions. There are other meanings, in particular the one you suggest &quot;type as Perl means it&quot; is one, but they don&#x27;t have a consistent formal definition and don&#x27;t have a consistent notion of &quot;type safety&quot; so it&#x27;s difficult to use them except in the regime of a single language.<p>Now, if we take &quot;type&quot; to mean this formal meaning I suggest then dynamic languages have exactly one type. This is a meaningful, if degenerate, analysis. Within this analysis, Perl has one type and trivially satisfies type safety because type safety essentially means &quot;things don&#x27;t randomly change types&quot; plus &quot;programs continue to evaluate until they reach pre-defined evaluation stopping points&quot;. Both of these hold <i>trivially</i> in a language with one type.<p>The system you refer to, given again that we&#x27;re sticking with the &quot;formal type&quot; terminology, is called a &quot;tag system&quot;. It exists &quot;below&quot; or &quot;after&quot; the static system which ensures type safety and can indeed induce interesting behavior. But, in particular, it is not an analysis which can be considered complete (in any turing compete language) because it <i>depends upon</i> running the program which can lead to non-termination.<p>So really the distinction is not &quot;deduction&quot; versus &quot;declaration&quot; but instead &quot;static&quot; versus &quot;dynamic&quot;. In general, static types are less powerful but more complete and dynamic tags are more powerful but highly incomplete. To confuse the two is to create a tremendous headache all around.",1423756633

What bothers me here is that they&#x27;re spending a lot of words and brainpower on a particular drive system for a theoretical starship - Fusion - and I don&#x27;t see anything demonstrating how, even if they can build a fusion drive with the specified power output that can run for 15 years at full power and meet various other engineering criteria, this will actually be good enough to propel a reasonable-sized starship to another star system.<p>I found this[0] chart at a NASA site a while ago purporting to say that, given the limitations of reaction-based rockets, a fusion rocket is still nowhere near good enough to reach even the closest star system in a reasonable time. The mass to drive a Shuttle cargo bay sized canister past Alpha Centauri in 900 years using Fusion power is supposedly 1000 supertankers of propellant. That&#x27;s the closest star system, and doesn&#x27;t count stopping, much less getting there in under a millennium. Even anti-matter, the best reaction-based rocket we can conceive of, is supposedly wildly impractical.<p>Given that, I&#x27;d like to see some quality calculations on exactly how they plan to get around the reaction mass problem before it makes sense to worry about stuff like materials in high radiation environments, and I don&#x27;t see anything like that on their site. They seem to just kinda hand-wave it away, as far as I can tell. It seems likely that to build a practical starship, we&#x27;ll need a propulsion system far beyond anything we can imagine today. Well, more realistically, calculations by people who seem to be qualified to perform them, since I&#x27;m probably not smart or well-versed enough to really understand it.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/images/content/84509main_warp06.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/centers/glenn/images/content/84509main_w...</a>",1423756000

Early for-profit investment occurs because investors believe they can sell their stake at a higher price down the line. Other reasons exist, such as the desire to do good in the world, but are entirely secondary. Most investors, and certainly the wealthier ones, have a fiduciary duty to turn away from world-saving in favor of making money. The market for early for-profit investment in turn indirectly steers research interests and the ability to raise funds from other sources: whatever is presently hot is much more likely to receive grants and philanthropic sponsorship. The state of the market at the end of the development process thus reaches back to influence every part of the long chain of research and development. The predicted inclinations of the greater fool are the tail that wags the dog.<p>The greater fool of interest for this post is the one indirectly funding the ongoing construction of a grand catalog of human metabolism, an exhaustive accounting of the fine details of how our cellular biochemistry operates and ages. This is understood in outline, but beneath that outline lies an enormous unexplored space of protein interactions, causes and consequences, and the relationship of various states in the system to health at every level. The greater fool is told by various parties that the goal is to enhance healthy longevity, but that isn&#x27;t really happening via these explorations of metabolism, and in truth doesn&#x27;t have much of a hope of happening via this research strategy. Look at the past fifteen years of sirtuin research in connection with the calorie restriction response, wherein the greater fool was - collectively - the GlaxoSmithKline shareholder community following the Sirtris acquisition. Well-managed hype sputtered out quite quickly after that liquidity event into nothing more than a slightly greater understanding of a few very narrow areas of mammalian biochemistry. This process happens over and again for each new potential calorie restriction mimetic, or other methodology claimed to slow the progress of aging by altering the operation of metabolism. Yet there is always a greater fool willing to buy.<p>Even if a drug was developed to completely mimic the beneficial effects of calorie restriction, so what? That is a convenience device, no more. Those practicing calorie restriction have somewhat better health and somewhat less age-related disease, and might live as many as five years longer. It&#x27;s a larger effect than any currently available medical technology can provide. Nonetheless, the large majority of those people do not and will not live to see 90 years of age in the environment of today&#x27;s medical technology. They still live the last years of their lives in frailty and pain. Why spend billions on striving to create a convenience device to recreate some of this marginal effect, tiny in the grand scheme of things? Because some people can get rich doing it.<p>The recent history of medical development related to slowing aging is that some folk have found they can do very well thank you by promising the prospect of enhanced longevity, while delivering nothing of value beyond scientific knowledge. In different circumstances I might be inclined to praise this as a great hack on investment community culture: direct more funding into life science research rather than cat pictures on the internet, and take a deserved cut as the individual who manages to make that happen. There are certainly far worse things for the greater fool to be talked into doing with his or her money.<p>Today, however, this business of making hay while the sun shines, based on ways to slightly slow aging largely emerged from calorie restriction research, is a distraction from the prospect of real progress. Messing with metabolism in this way cannot even in principle produce meaningful rejuvenation: aging is damage, and slowing down the damage does nothing for people who are already old and damaged. Yet there are other research strategies that can achieve this goal: the better approach is to repair the damage that causes aging, following the existing detailed research plans that aim to produce new rejuvenation biotechnologies. These can in principle restore youthful function for the old, extend healthy life indefinitely, and should not be any more expensive to explore and develop than a continued future of whatever the next replacement for sirtuin research might be. If billions are spent, then let it be in the pursuit of technologies that do offer the possibility for everyone to live to 90, and in good health, lacking frailty, pain, and disease.<p>It&#x27;s a fight to make this case. It shouldn&#x27;t be, but it is. Attention continues to be soaked up by marginal, ultimately pointless efforts such as the pursuit of mTOR-influencing drugs like rapalogs. It won&#x27;t let you live to be 90 in confidence, it won&#x27;t create rejuvenation in the old, and no foreseeable evolution of this strategy can in fact provide those benefits. It is just more of the same search for the greater fool to retroactively bankroll the continuing mapping of metabolism.",1423755853

With fiber there are more and more people having 100+ Mbps uplink, and these people can serve dozens of others peers, and this balances the asymmetry partially.<p>>-- ISPs are suspicious of heavy uploads originating from residential homes and could be flagged as &quot;servers&quot; in violation of ISP&#x27;s TOS or reclassified as &quot;business&quot; thereby increasing the billing amount.<p>This must be different depending your country and ISP, but the upside comparing to some full P2P service like Bittorent is that you share video segments only while you are on the streamer webpage (as soon as you close your tab the p2p stops), and also all the communications are encrypted with DTLS provided by WebRTC, so it is not so easy for ISPs to figure out what is exchanged.\nAnd finally, we actually help the ISPs by connecting the peers that use the same ISPs, and are on the same sub-networks first, so they have less peering issues.<p>>-- too much latency for live mega events (World Cup, etc) because of asymmetry mentioned above. (Your neighbor tweets that Spain scored the winning goal before your P2P stream received the last packets showing that it happened.) Latency for bittorrent is ok, but for live megaevents, no.<p>I think that this where our technology really differentiates with the old peer-to-peer systems : we don&#x27;t add any additional latency to the stream, but just use the latency already generated by HTTP streaming protocols like HLS or MPEG-DASH. So with or without our system, you will still have a 20-30 seconds latency with the encoder, as it is already the case with all the professional live streams like the ones used during Superbowl or the World Cup.<p>As for CDNs cooperating to broadcast a live stream, it is not really the spirit of the CDN market right now, instead what happens is that the Broadcaster can contract one or several backup CDNs for their biggest events, and use them in case the primary CDNs breaks down. This is what happened for the Superbowl stream : NBC had Akamai as their primary CDN, and Level3 as a backup. In the end they didn&#x27;t have to use the backup, but still paid both CDNs for the event !",1423755284

E.g. the Lisp Machine was conceived not long after Intel shipped the first generally available DRAM chip, a whopping 1,024 bits (which was used along with the first model of the PDP-11 to provide graphics terminals to the MIT-AI PDP-10), etc. etc.<p>So there was a lot to be said for making a custom TTL CPU optimized for Lisp.  And only that, initially: to provide some perspective, the three major improvements of LMI&#x27;s LAMBDA CPU over the CADR were using Fairchild&#x27;s FAST family of high speed TTL, stealing one bit from the 8 bits dedicated to tags to double the address space (no doubt a hack enabled by it having a 2 space copying GC), and adding a neat TRW 16 bit integer multiply chip.<p>The game radically changed when you could fit all of a CPU on a single silicon die.  And for a whole bunch of well discussed reasons, to which I would add Symbolics being very badly managed, and LMI killed off by dirty Canadian politics, there was no RISC based Lisp processor, Lisp Machines didn&#x27;t make the transition to that era.  And now CPUs are so fast, so wide, have so much cache ... e.g. more L3 cache than a Lisp Machine of old was likely to have in DRAM, the hardware case isn&#x27;t compelling.  Although I&#x27;m following the lowRISC project because they propose to add 2 tag bits to the RISC-V architecture.<p>So, we&#x27;re really talking about software, and what was the Lisp Machine in that respect.  Well, us partisans of it thought it was the highest leveraged software development platform in existence, akin to supercomputers for leveraging scientists (another field that&#x27;s changed radically, in part due to technology, in part due to geopolitics changing for the better).<p>For now, I&#x27;ll finish this overly long comment by asking if a modern, productive programmer could be so without using a web browser along with the stuff we think of as software development tools.  I.e., what would/should the scope of a 21st Century Lisp Machine be?",1423754100

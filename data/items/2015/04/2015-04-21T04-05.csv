OpenBLAS or MKL are much better choices and don&#x27;t need autotuning.<p>2. You can call these libraries from any language, so Fortran offers no advantage there.<p>3. Fortran performance is similar to C and C++ (assuming use of restrict where needed).<p>4. CUDA will <i>not</i> lead to 10-40x boost unless your CPU implementation is garbage.  The realistic standard is about 2x when normalized by Watts; see the Green500 for example.  The 2x also holds for price when using server-grade parts (like Tesla), but GPUs come out further ahead if you buy consumer grade. Note that you still have to pay to buy and power a host, and that GPUs are a lot less versatile in terms of problem size/turn-around time and workload. They have their place, but evaluate your workload carefully before concluding that the cost proposition favors GPUs.",1429592390

We once had Inquisitions and witch burnings, and then the Enlightenment put an end to that. We had slavery and Jim Crow, and then the Emancipation Proclamation and the Civil Rights movement fixed those.<p>The unspoken implication is that the problems are now solved. Schools teach children the injustices of history, but rarely talk about the injustice of the status quo. The message is that the evil is past, and that <i>present</i> authority is legitimate and benevolent.<p>So, what injustices will students learn about in 2100?<p>I think that today&#x27;s mass incarceration, the war on drugs, and unequal education will be towards the top of the list. Students will learn how we once had 5% of the world&#x27;s population, but 50% of the world&#x27;s inmates. They&#x27;ll learn how many of those inmates were in jail for nonviolent offenses, especially drug offenses. One of the root causes for the cycle of poverty, crime, and jail time is unequal education. It manifests in the many communities and schools that simply don&#x27;t teach children the skills necessary to succeed or make a legitimate living. Students of the future will probably learn how some of the worst schools in the industrialized world in the early 21st century were sometimes a few miles away from the best, separated by a certain road or a set of train tracks. &quot;Schools&quot; with fifteen year olds that were barely literate, with armed police officers on staff, with metal detectors at the entrance.<p>Then, they&#x27;ll learn how those injustices were fixed.<p>---<p>I&#x27;m sure at some point we&#x27;ll shift from punishing the poor to trying harder to empower them--or at least empower their children--to live better.<p>What can we do today to be part of that?",1429591457

This is not true, despite how nice it sounds and how good it makes people feel.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter how hard you try, you are not going to be the next Bill Gates, you are not going to be the next Elon Musk. Applying to Y Combinator and flipping to Google is not within the reach of everyone no matter how many hours you put in.<p>Modern personality theory brings this to light, and it&#x27;s bloody uncomfortable for most people. The US Army, for example, during wartime, considered that people with an IQ of less than 85 were not trainable, at all, and were more of a liability than an asset. If I remember right that is roughly 10% of the population. 10% of the population cannot be trained to do anything useful in capitalist society, not even by the Army during wartime.<p>Now, can everyone just &quot;get a job&quot; or &quot;work hard and make a living&quot;? Science seems to be saying no. The biggest US government institution looking for bodies said no. There is no saftey net built in to society for these people in some of the biggest first world countries. Now imagine being below average... aren&#x27;t you just lucky the dice rolled in your favour.

Timeless works are the ones which happen, overall, to appeal to the most people - it doesn&#x27;t mean they necessarily are higher &quot;quality.&quot;  It also has to do with how accessible they are, how ubiquitous (/ marketed), etc.<p>(Sidenote, but his arguments against startup aesthetics could also apply to modernism and many other movements.  It&#x27;s about distilling something to it&#x27;s essence, removing superfluous details in favor of clarity.  For all the faults &quot;flat&quot; design has, I think it is a noble cause even if it takes some missteps.)<p>There is a lot of contemporary work (programming, music, art, etc) that I find compelling, and personally I want to embrace it.  Understanding the contemporary helps you understand the current moment of time, and where things are going.  It lets you see larger trends and where you might want to fit in.  I&#x27;m not very afraid of embracing something that turns out to be a false start - at least, at the moment, I was doing what I thought was best.  Maybe this is a fallacy of youth.<p>I&#x27;m all for embracing the classics, the tried and true.  But I think applying lessons learned from them to the unproven ideas is where things get interesting.",1429591217

I then became a landscape gardener for four years. Guess what? My shortsightedness disappeared, as did my hayfever and weak knees. Now I am back in an office (much much better wages) and my shortsightedness is starting to return. So a combination of aggressive diagnosis and lack of eye exercise.",1429589255

(It just happens that many psychologists are causal empiricists, but it has nothing per se to do with their love of measurement.)",1429589131

9412220,comment,9411935,9412142,0,0,analog31,,,"Granted, I have practically no background in academic psychology research. I am willing to believe that there is a kernel of science in psychology.<p>And I &#x27;believe&#x27; in statistics, which is just math after all. This is notwithstanding the apparent fact that the social and life sciences seem to be in a state of panic right now due to issues regarding the <i>use</i> of statistics. At best, it means that a few reports should be discarded. At worst, I have to anticipate that there may be entire fields or subfields that are &quot;science,&quot; but that have produced no reliable scientific knowledge base as of yet.<p>But for a layperson like myself, my only likely contact with psychology is at least a couple steps removed from academic science:<p>1. Does the application of scientific methodology actually produce useful scientific knowledge in all fields at the present state of the art?<p>2. Are people who claim to apply psychological knowledge in ways that affect me, likely to use that knowledge in an unbiased and ethical fashion?<p>In my life, we are talking about people such as educators (of my kids), HR managers, journalists, and little consultants. Should I trust these people to tell me anything that I don&#x27;t already know about myself or through general common sense?<p>This is how it can come to pass that something is both &quot;science&quot; and &quot;bullshit&quot; when viewed from opposite ends of a pipeline from basic research to practical application.",1429588964

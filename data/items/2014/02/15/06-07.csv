I reckon the main reason that <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> hasn&#x27;t aged half as much as <i>Alien</i>, or <i>Silent Running</i>, or other 70s/80s sci-fi, is that in <i>2001</i>, all of the monitors are flat-screen displays, not curved CRTs. Ironically, this is only because they didn&#x27;t have the computing power to generate the HAL graphics on an actual computer, and so it was all hand-animated on film and then back-projected onto a flat display. This combination of flatness and high-resolution animation means that it looks just like the retina displays of today.",1392447576

Understanding the difference between surface temperatures and the actual thermal potential of the earths oceans are two different tasks. EG, due to sub-surface thermal venting there are many areas of the deep ocean that don&#x27;t at all look like surface temps. {etc} So there is huge potential for the oceans to do unexpected things. For all we know, plate tectonics may be driving huge amounts of thermal energy variation in the deep ocean...and a &quot;proper climate model&quot; would likely need to understand this at some stage.

7242958,comment,7242155,7242823,9,0,waps,,,"Interesting article.<p>I disagree in methodology with the article on several fronts however. It basically boils down to them selecting IPCC predictions after the fact, and even after cherry picking what they compare with, they still adjust the data. Then they also cherry-pick what dataset to compare against. Even that is only enough to raise the observed level just above the lower bounds. Even then, I find that the data presented in their graphs does not look at all like a &quot;remarkably good&quot; prediction. But I disagree strongly with this way of evaluating the data. When evaluating a prediction made in the past you do not get to cherry pick out of a set of predictions, you ONLY get to pick the one you found most likely in the past.  Second you most certainly do not get to adjust the prediction made in the past in any way. The article violates both. That means if you want to convince me, please unadjusted business-as-usual scenario only.<p>From the article:<p>> Figure 2 accounts for the lower observed GHG emissions than in the IPCC BAU projection, and compares its &#x27;Best&#x27; adjusted projection with the observed global surface warming since 1990.<p>In case you&#x27;re wondering, adjusted means adjusted by the author of the article (in december 2012). That&#x27;s just unfair. Also &quot;Best&quot; does NOT mean the best scenario as set forth in the IPCC first assessment report, but the one he finds agrees with the data. This is bullshit. Cherry-picking predictions. Adjusting the results of you prediction AFTER the results are known. Sorry, but let me summarize my attitude here : fuck off.<p>Furthermore he cheats by omission : there are 2 major temperature records, and guess what, he uses the warmest measurement. Not mentioned anywhere in the article.<p>From the IPCC first assessment report (policymaker&#x27;s section):<p>> under the IPCC Business-as-Usual (Scenario A) emissions of greenhouse gases, a rate of increase of global mean temperature during the next century of about 0 3°C per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0 2°C to 0 5°C per decade), this is greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years This will result in a likely increase in global mean temperature of about 1°C above the present value by 2025 and VC before the end of the next century The rise will not be steady because of the influence of other factors.<p>If you simply take the recommendation from the policymaker&#x27;s section, and evaluate the temperatures against that, an entirely different picture emerges. I don&#x27;t intend to make a graph here, but let&#x27;s summarize :<p>IPCC prediction in BAU scenario :<p>0.2 to 0.5 degrees rise per decade from 1990 to 2010<p>Now obviously there&#x27;s various ways to calculate the actual temperature difference, but none of them see 0.2 degrees rise:<p>1990 vs 2000 : 0.03 degrees warmer in 2000 (and no, 1990 was not particularly warm, although 2000 appears to have been a relatively cold year. Taking 1999 or 2001 or even 2002 still doesn&#x27;t fix their prediction though)<p>Average of the 90s versus average of 2000-2010: 0.13 degrees rise (this I find the &quot;fairest&quot; way of measuring, but it doesn&#x27;t allow us to evaluate 2000-2010 yet)<p>Average of the first 2 years of the decade (meaning you can check accuracy for 2000-2010 as well)<p>1990 -> 2000 : 0.15 degrees warmer in 2000\n2000 -> 2010 : 0.05 degrees warmer in 2010<p>I have made my own graphs of the situation (Ipython rocks !), and overlayed them on the actual pictures from the IPCC publications, and the simple observation is : we are currently below the 95% certainty interval of the BAU scenario in the IPCC FAR. And it is a matter of 0.9 degrees in 2010 (that is, the real observed temperature was 0.9 degrees below the lower bound set forth in the IPCC&#x27;s report), which is more than the predicted rise during that period (in other words : the error is bigger than the prediction).<p>So sorry to say, but this article fixes up the data by cherrypicking from the FAR, adding in &quot;adjustments&quot; and yes, it seems to be able to come to a reasonable picture. I call bullshit on that methodology though, for obvious reasons. If you&#x27;re defending your prediction made in 1990 you do not get to revise said prediction in any way. You also don&#x27;t get to make 5 predictions in 1990, then pick the &quot;average&quot; from 2 of them and show it matches the data.<p>So perhaps I should be more explicit : comparing the current satellite temperature record to the IPCC FAR report&#x27;s &quot;Business as usual&quot; scenario, without adjusting it, the temperature has been below the lower bound of the 95% certainty interval since 1994. After 1996 there hasn&#x27;t been a single temperature peak in the IPCC&#x27;s predicted bounds. They were wrong, and not just a little bit.<p>A similar problem occurs between my own evaluation of the IPCC&#x27;s second third and fourth report (and the article doesn&#x27;t look at the fifth, probably because there&#x27;s not that much data to evaluate it). I find this article woefully unconvincing.",1392446869

The tank skin was less than 0.5mm thick, and the whole thing was held up by internal pressure. 5 PSI minimum, all the time. They were quite strong if you didn&#x27;t screw up--but something will always screw up eventually, I guess. Apparently at least one other launch vehicle was lost to under-pressurization, an Atlas-Agena, but it was during testing and only had a dummy payload.<p>New Atlas V (which isn&#x27;t much related to the old Atlas) is self supporting, so this isn&#x27;t a problem there. But the Centaur upper stage, which is widely used for planetary work and GEO insertion, is still a balloon tank, though I don&#x27;t know of any mishaps with it.<p>The old Atlas was a weird bird in other ways, too. It had &quot;1 and one half&quot; stages, because they didn&#x27;t know if you could start a rocket engine in space. It had two vernier engines that ran the whole time. And they invented WD-40 so they could slather the whole thing in anti-corrosive, even though it was stainless steel, because the skin was too thin to allow any hint of corrosion.<p>Closing the valves on a fueled and deflating Atlas indeed sounds like conspicuous bravery to me. The era of &quot;steely-eyed missile men&quot; indeed.",1392444376

The flaw with your model is that it&#x27;s not iterated. A more realistic dictator&#x27;s game would be iterated (repeated).

7242865,comment,7235810,7236581,1,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>&quot;populations will grow far above reasonable levels&quot;</i><p>This theory was considered state of the art in 1798 (when Malthus proposed it) and refuted by 1838 (when Verhulst came up with a better model, which fits actual population data much better).<p>Populations do occasionally grow &quot;far above reasonable levels&quot; and then crash, but this requires pretty extreme circumstances.  The best example I can think of is the Kaibab Deer population -- various human decisions (killing off predators, changes to hunting policies, changes to livestock grazing policies) caused the deer population to explode over the course of 20 years, and the deer population crashed a few years later as it overshot what the environment could sustain and caused substantial damage.  That population curve is more or less A-shaped, with a steep climb and steep dropoff.<p>Populations in general don&#x27;t behave that way.  Most populations of most organisms we know of have an S-shaped curve, with a steep growth phase and then a leveling out phase that involves very little &quot;overshoot&quot; and very little &quot;catastrophic resolution&quot;.  (Human population looks to be following exactly such a trajectory, and is on course to level off somewhere in the 9-12 billion range.)",1392444266

As we&#x27;ve established, they will not censor anything; instead, if they determine your complaint to have some level of validity, they will send you to the actual host.<p>In one instance, the booter site had no information on registration or what was offered, so I gave them the hackforums thread where the service is being sold. I realize this is basically hearsay and not sufficient evidence to actually shut a site down, but remember that they won&#x27;t shut a site down in any case. They did not consider this acceptable enough to release information about the host. They wanted me to register an account there and provide it to them for verification. Luckily, I could register without actually paying anything, providing me a nice UI with a big &quot;launch attack&quot; button, and this was sufficient for them.<p>More recently, they will not even release the site&#x27;s IP address. All they will do is tell you to email the abuse department of [host] and ask the abuse department to contact them for details. This is ridiculous.<p>CloudFlare purports to be against DDoS attacks, yet has no problem providing service to admitted DDoS attack services. In other words, CloudFlare is a racketeering operation. They create the problem, indirectly, and offer services to solve it. (I realize they offer a free tier, but their advanced mitigation features are only available on paid tiers.)",1392444213

I&#x27;ve noticed a few other YC founders (and successful sfba founders in general) who have strong accents; they&#x27;re at a disadvantage, but it&#x27;s not terminal.  (the worst accents compared to overall level of success otherwise are probably Singlish speakers; EE are sometimes thick accents but generally standard vocabulary and grammar, and Indian English is a little bit of vocabulary but mainly pacing and accent, and generally not very far off from SFBA American English after a few months)<p>What I <i>don&#x27;t</i> see is a lot of founders who are bad at written communication.  Maybe it&#x27;s self-selection (those who can&#x27;t write are less likely to try to write online, so I won&#x27;t see them as frequently, if ever), but it really seems like being good at written English is a requirement for being a successful tech entrepreneur now.  &quot;Good at written English&quot; doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean perfectly idiomatic and grammatical American College English, but clear and persuasive when the reader is fluent in (American, College, Middle/Upper class, Standard) English.<p>The nice thing is written English is much easier for &quot;tech people&quot; to learn; the best training is reading lots of well-written English, and you need to do that to participate in the technology and startup world anyway.

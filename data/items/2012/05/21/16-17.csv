Deafness is far worse a disability than blindness for most people in terms of integrating into and succeeding in society. The reason for this is that human beings are social creatures and deafness isolates people, while blindness doesn't. This is the reason that there is a whole unique deaf culture that tends to stay separate from mainstream culture. Within deaf culture, deaf people are not isolated.<p>This is the reason that many deaf people are morally opposed to cochlear implants.

After a user submits negative feedback, they are not invited to do so - only a highly motivated user would then bother to leave the app, find the entry in the App Store and write a review there. What's more, it's hard to say whether some users will even understand the difference between your internal feedback UI and the Apple App Store review UI. i.e. they might think that your feedback form posts into the App Store reviews area.<p>For the record, the article does not claim ""this is evil"" (as kgtm stated earlier).

If you listen to some of the other 5by5 podcasts they are much more professionally done - intros/outros, some focus, and sections in some cases.  I think Dan is very aware of traditional 'radio' methodology and knows that you do that stuff to guide listeners and give them context.  The Talk Show didn't really need that... it was just him and Gruber BS'ing about whatever Apple/tech news was popular that week.  Which is fine, because Gruber has some interesting insights on Apple.<p>Personally, I get that kind of content from the Web already and much prefer deeper analysis of issues.

If Google's stock price fell off a cliff tomorrow it would be all over the news and their customers (advertisers) might have some questions. But there are two things to keep in mind:<p>1) If their stock price fell off a cliff, there's got to be a reason. It could be basically anything, but it has to exist and be well-known (maybe Larry Page had a breakdown, shaved his head and tried to run down some reporters, whatever). The event that caused stockholders to sell (thus crashing the stock) probably would have been enough to cause Google's customers to ask questions, the stock price is then just incidental. It's a ""chicken and egg"" problem in some sense.<p>2) Stock price <i>really</i> doesn't have any impact on the everyday functioning of an otherwise-healthy company. Stock price is a reflection of the buying and selling happening on the stock market, so fluctuations in price <i>can</i> actually have nothing to do with the current health of the company in question. Maybe tomorrow a report comes out that indicates search-based advertising will start to decline next year and will be half what is today in 2020. This would likely lead to a decrease in Google's stock price. But it probably wouldn't lead to many companies dumping Adsense, at least not yet. A report about the future affects the stock price, but it doesn't necessarily affect the customers <i>today</i>.<p>Stock prices are abstract and largely disconnected from the actual company.

Thus $FB kills silicon valley and makes wall street that much more attractive.<p>disclosure: I'm bullish $FB and bet it's likely to recover, although status in such uncertain climates only comes from short-term coups.  So I may make 12% on my investment over a 28 day time frame, but at what cost?  I look like a fool and am used like a tool in the media circus clown show. It's not worth it, but I'm not strong enough to bet otherwise.",1337616037

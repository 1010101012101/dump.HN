Andre would see my cube lights on and come over to talk to me.

Gamestop needs to do something to put themselves in a position to be relevant in 5-10 years or the Xbox 3 and Playstation 4 at some point in their lifecycle will likely be close enough to digital only that you'll have 80% of sales be digital instead of 10-20%.

4307655,comment,4290359,4299215,1,0,javert,,,"First, thank you very much for taking the time to explain things to me. I really appreciate it, and I learned a lot from your post.<p>Regarding the ""appalling oversight."" To be fair, I would probably say this about 99% of all physics articles written for the layman. Practically all of them contain abstractions which the intelligent layman cannot connect to actual reality. I certainly encountered this in physics classes in college. This infuriates me to no end. I suspect the ""average person"" (I am not actually that average) doesn't really mind, and perhaps doesn't even really notice. The thing about it which actually infuriates me, is that I think a lot of scientists actually kind of delight in this.<p>Of course, a large reason for this whole problem is that the nature of scientific truths about reality has not yet been established among scientists (or really anyone in general, modulo a small group of philosophers I happen to agree with). So there is a sense in which it is ""not their fault.""<p>Regarding calling it a ""curved three-dimensional surface."" No, I do not think that is an acceptable description, because a surface is, by definition, defined as a 2D space within a 3D volume. You can't just throw out the definition. It's important to maintain the integrity of our concepts (including our definitions). The practical consequence of throwing out the integrity of our concepts is, for one thing, that someone like myself can't actually understand what is going on. (I have an MS and am about half way though a PhD). Now that you have explained the whole reason for describing it that way to me, I understand what it is - but I could not have understood it before that, and neither could the vast majority of readers of that article (unless they happened to be physicists). The practical consequences of this are possibly much wider than just confusing non-physicists, though.<p>To clarify my reason for defining a ""surface"" as I did. First, I think that's the actual everyday definition. More fundamentally - that is the only concrete thing in reality that people actually encounter. In other words, we do not encounter ""3D surfaces"" in reality, because that would require four dimensions. That fact is precisely why ""surface"" means what it does in English, and not what it (apparently) means in Physics.<p>It may be that Physics has accepted that certain words mean certain things, distinct from what they do in English. If that is the case, it was a mistake historically, and physicists today should be keenly aware of the issue when writing and teaching, so that they do not confuse ordinary people. Ordinary people need to push back harder on physicists to explain things in terms of concretes they can relate to in reality or (where needed) explicit mathemetics (as you did in your explanation).",1343539919

That figure showed up in an Italian court ruling and was mentioned in open court in The Hague, Netherlands, by Apple's Dutch counsel.""<p>2.4% of $650-$850 (Retail range of Unlocked iPhone 4S) is around $16-$20 per device. Quad-band 3G UMTS modems retail as low as $13 in lots of 1000. That's a full modem not just the UMTS chipset. And trust me Apple is not buying chipsets retail or in lots of 1000.<p>sources:\n<a href=""http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/07/apple-seeks-25-billion-in-damages-from.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/07/apple-seeks-25-billion-in...</a><p><a href=""http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/571149685/Low_peice_OEM_7_2Mbps_HSDPA.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alibaba.com/product-gs/571149685/Low_peice_OEM_7_...</a>",1343538504

It was also pretty frustrating for the channels to be things like 38.4. I got the feeling the cable company did that on purpose to try and make the experience as frustrating as they could.",1343538483

I don't want to subscribe to a cable or satellite service that I wouldn't use (and then pay extra for BBC channels), and I like a lot of their content. I'd gladly pay the BBC money for easy, legal online access to it.",1343538333

I've tried using daytum and askmeevery.com to achieve similar QS tracking, but for some reason neither really resonated.<p>I think you've really hit on something with the push notifications.  AskMeEvery uses scheduling along with SMS and email to achieve something similar, but ultimately their tracking wasn't as robust as I would have liked.<p>I agree with dchuk in that the real power here has to do with your ability to turn raw data into true insights on trends and what affects a person's mood.<p>I saw you plan to make the data available to users over time.  When you do so, it might be cool to also add some kind of data analysis forum or outlet where users can share the tools they've created to analyze their moods over time.<p>I'd also love to create custom categories or fields that I can check off so that when the app pings me, I answer something like Overall Mood: ____  Food:_____ Idea: ____ or something to that effect.  This could also work with the tagging feature someone mentioned.<p>Thanks again for the share.  I'm looking forward to getting my first ping and putting this app to work.",1343538254

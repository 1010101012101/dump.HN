Rather than ignore it or tell her to cut it out, she is arrested and put in the system to teach her a lesson where she is brutalized with progressive increasing severity, making her more and more angry, and misbehave more and more, getting charged with trespassing and creating a disturbance. Finally, with her never having committed anything that most rational people would consider serious crimes, she turns 18 and they lock her in adult prison in solitary confinement where she kills herself in despair.<p>According to <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/out_of_control/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/2009-2010/out_of_control/</a> the crab apple flinging charge ended up resulting in a total of 4 years hard prison time.<p>The methods used against this child by the Canadian authorities are quite interesting.

From this it is clear her abuse was not something that just happened at a single rogue facility.<p>If you beat your dog everyday and it finally bites you, is it a bad dog? Is the dog mentally ill?<p>I see she was adopted and is obviously from her appearance an indigenous first nations child. It's quite common for these children to be kidnapped from their nations by the canadian government in order to be resocialized away from their culture under the guise of protecting them and the premise that first nations people are incapable of caring for their own children and exposure to their own culture is a form of abuse. It's a racist and genocidal policy the goal of which is to exterminate their ethnicity and culture.

4895808,comment,4895710,4895710,20,0,JulianWasTaken,,,"It's true that double underscore methods are sometimes underused and that using them can often make for a better experience, but it's also easy to be overly clever, or to ""misuse"" them by using them to add semantics to an object that is already a bit mis-designed.<p>The first example in the post (using __repr__) is probably the least controversial. There are places in the official docs that explicitly recommend defining __repr__ for every object you create. This is mostly something that I do do (though there are exceptions of course), but one thing you do want to be careful with is to make sure that what appears in your repr is relevant, terse, and helpful. That means that I <i>will</i> and do sacrifice a repr that is eval'able (which I find to be useless) for a repr that is short and sweet. So for the example in the article, it may or may not make sense to put `self.objects` in there. For a ""Container"" class, it probably does, but don't extend that to ""let's put all our data in the repr for everything"".<p>__iter__ is nice, and is one of the most oddly underused methods, but rather than using it there, I think the better thing is to not have the object encapsulate a search, but to have the object encapsulate a YoutubeAPIClient or whatever, and have `search` be a method that returns an iterable. This is also kinda touchy-feely though since I guess there might be examples of __iter__ where I'd feel more comfortable with something like this (a results object).<p>The next one with __sub__ I don't like too much, because I don't like encouraging slow operations with syntax sugar (besides the typechecking).<p>Anyways, I guess I'm nitpicking on examples, mostly. Double underscore methods are generally underused I've found, and if you have doubts on whether you're overreaching, you can always add a method with the same behavior you're using them for in case anyone doesn't like how it reads.",1355082347

He states, ""Solitary confinement worsens the quality of criminal care. Long term isolation is powerfully destructive. When you consider that many of those who are confined have psychological problems, the effects can be devastating.""<p>The article also quotes Christer Karlsson, Swedish and chairman of the help organisation Criminals Return Into Society, saying solitary confinement ""can break prisoners down, physically and psychologically"".<p>The article also notes that Swedish prisons have more hardened criminals as prisoners than before. Thus perhaps one would argue that solitary confinement for non-violent prisoners protects them from being harmed by the hardened criminals. Perhaps the vast majority of prisoners in Sweden are dangerous violent serial killers and rapists and thus it is more economical to put the small number of harmless non-violent prisoners in solitary confinement to protect them rather than put the violent offenders in solitary to protect others from them. It has yet to be demonstrated that this is the case though, that the majority of prisoners are violent and can not be managed. In addition, it is known that solitary confinement is damaging and is a form of torture, thus to force torture upon someone in order to protect them seems counterproductive. Torture as therapy is not an established or recognized way of protecting people, and runs counter to what is known about torture.",1355081054

Placebos aren't a cause, they are an illusion. I guess it would be all right if the customers could pay using imaginary money.<p>If I claim to have a cure for the common cold, and if I shake a dried gourd over the cold sufferer for a week, do I have the right to claim victory and collect money?<p>> I suppose there is a very fine grey line between that and just outright lying to someone about a product.<p>The line is much clearer than that. If the treatment isn't validated in objective double-blind clinical trials, it's not a medical treatment and no claims can be made for it.<p>I can't tell you how many advertisements I've seen that said ""Clinically tested!"" but without also mentioning, ""The tests failed!"" :)",1355079739

My oldest son has the same diagnosis, my youngest son is a carrier and by living with me they were both exposed to the same germs. All three of us have gotten healthier together. Second, there are a handful of people who have listened to me and seen significant improvements. Most of them are unwilling to speak up publically. They just want to get better. They don't want to be subjected to the personal attacks I routinely endure. Third, everyone seeing better results than doctors predict for my deadly condition pretty much follow some of the same general principles I follow in some form or other, including looking to diet as a major means to address their health issues.<p>Last, doctor's routinely dismiss people with CF and write them off.

Honestly, I do. Except for minor incident that I recall, PyCon US has largely been free of issues such as this. Every meetup, conference, etc I have been to has been filled with nice, kind people and largely jerk-free. This is a testament to the community as a whole.<p>So, you ask: if we're all chill cool people, and nothing bad has happened, why have one?<p>Because it won't always be that way.<p>If we continue to expand and grow (and we will), and if we continue to grow even more diverse - in sex, race, creed and geography - the chances of ""an incident"" will grow. In fact, I know incidents have happened and been dealt with.<p>So no, the unspoken rule of ""don't be a jerk"" doesn't scale very well. And that's what we're talking about - a scalability problem. The social norms and rules of a group of five people, or one hundred people may float. What about 200? 500? 800? How about 2300 people (the attendance of PyCon 2012)? No. ""Don't be a Jerk"" may be our unspoken, unwritten community motto; but its not enough for those on the outside looking in.<p>Those outside of these circles want clear lines on behavioral expectations. They want to know that not only are there unwritten rules about not being a jerk - they want to know what will happen if a Jerk Occurs. This sets their expectations, and it gives them comfort. It makes them feel more welcome, more safe. Especially when they're part of a group who has been put under constant objectification and harassment for decades in our industry.</i>",1355079656

Objective-C doesn't have a significant presence in the browser, and is consequently a useless language for achieving a monolingual <i>web</i> stack. The article demonstrates a complete lack of awareness of the frontend side of the web and assumes that iOS apps are this frontend. There is not a single mention of JavaScript, or even the word ""browser"".<p>It also seems to be overly focused on the idea of computational performance, when in many cases applications are IO-bound.

38165,comment,37928,38107,0,0,blader,,,"Yes, exactly. <p>You're kind of proving my point here. Designing clothing is hard. Designing web apps are hard. You need to be good at each to be successful at each. You won't be good at either if all you have is a ""business/marketing genius"" with an idea.",1185918992

""<p>You should only stop feeling guilty if you think that a co-founder is only good for a source of ideas.  A co-founder isn't an idea guy (tho they should have ideas).  They are someone who:<p>-has skills you don't have.
-will motivate you.
-will make your good ideas better
-will produce ideas that you won't<p>You might be an exception to the rule, but IMHO it's pretty amazing hubris to think that you have all of the ingredients necessary for a successful startup.",1185918502

Get better quality items. About the ones that you didn't use ever, when you get an urge to buy them remind yourself of this pie chart that you made! ",1185918099

While stuff might not seem important, if that supply line ever gets cut, we'll see how important it really is.<p>The making of stuff also factors into global power.  The US was able to win a war on two fronts in WWII in part because of its ability to make stuff.  Remember the guns vs. butter axes on the production possibility curve in ECON101?<p><p>",1185917568

38147,comment,38028,38028,0,0,edgeztv,,,"When I was a kid growing up in the USSR, ""stuff"" was really important to everyone because everything was really hard to get. Those who grew up in the West can't possibly understand how valuable even the most insignificant stuff seemed there.  Petty theft was rampant.  If you left a load of laundry unattended you could come back and find even your socks missing.  <p>The ""stuff"" mindset is very difficult for some people to break.  Over the first few years living in the US, my mother had accumulated more useless stuff than most people who'd spent their whole lives here.  After 15 years in the US, she still worries about leaving her stuff in the laundromat.<p>I've been thinking about the subject a lot over the years and Paul's essay is spot-on.  The more money I make, the more I dislike ""stuff"".  I hardly bought anything since I started my first job after college.  In contrast I used to buy a fair amount of junk before.  My room was always cluttered and I hated being at home because I felt like the stuff drained all my energy.<p>It's true that stuff owns people and not the other way around.  My neighbor in Cambridge, MA keeps a backyard (more like a junkyard) full of used construction materials and equipment, including 3 dead trucks.  He spends every single evening trying to straighten it out, but ends up just wheelbarrowing stuff from place to place without any noticeable progress.  I, on the other hand, am now able to spend every evening working on my startup, and not having stuff makes me feel great!",1185916809
38146,comment,38028,38028,0,0,mhartl,,,"I've had the same epiphany, and was doing something about it as recently as today.  One thing that stops me from getting rid of my stuff is that my dad has been associated with Goodwill Industries for years, and he is always talking about how he's donating stuff to Goodwill (but not before asking me if I want some of it first---which I sometimes take because even I get tired of saying ""no"" all the time).  But Goodwill is like 15 minutes away, you have to put stuff in a box or a bag and haul it over there, and I've never been there before so I don't know exactly how to get there.  My trash can, on the other hand, is right here.  That doesn't seem like a big difference, but it's big enough that it has kept probably 50 lbs. of clothes in my closet and drawers that I never wear.  I'm as resistant to guilt as anyone I know, but even I have a hard time throwing away ""perfectly good"" clothing that's only been worn once.",1185916801

38142,comment,37850,38101,0,0,pg,,,"I don't think you have to change universities to make people start startups.  Once word spreads among hackers that it works, more will.<p>What I'd ask is: what could you teach in universities that will help people later in startups?  There are some interesting answers to that.  One thing engineering schools could do right now is teach more product design, instead of assuming their graduates will all go off to work in big companies as mere implementors.",1185916050
38141,comment,38028,38134,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"The quote is not in his post. I got the impression from ""I have too much stuff,"" followed by ""Companies that sell stuff have spent huge sums training us to think stuff is still valuable. But it would be closer to the truth to treat stuff as worthless."" Is there some other meaning I could divine from those statements?<p>""The context is totally dependant on who the individual is.""<p>That's true. There's an information component to ads -- which is why I advocated skepticism over censorship. But in general, if you have two companies that are both pursuing a value-maximizing strategy selling the same product, and one does ads, the other is going to have higher quality (have you seen ads for McDonald's? Have you seen ads for, say, Beffa's (<a href=""http://www.beffas.com/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.beffas.com/home.html</a>)?).<p>'Lastly, how does 'ignore manipulate ads' equate to 'buy stuff when the focus is on creating something valuable, not convincing you that something is valuable? That is quite the jump.""<p>If you don't spend the money, you either a) destroy it, b) save it, or c) spend it on other stuff. If b), remember that saving is deferred spending, so b) and c) are the same with different timing.",1185916029
38140,comment,38028,38128,0,0,geebee,,,"just to add - I've noticed that most of the parents around my neighborhood now buy and sell used toys very frequently, much more often than parents did when I was a kid.  This is partly because the web is much more efficient than the newspaper, and it's cheaper to buy used.  But the real benefit is that it gives us the ability to essentially rent the toy.  There's little doubt that I'm going to end up with a plastic workbench, but my $50 is really more of a deposit - a promise to take good enough care of it to pass it on to the next 2 year old.

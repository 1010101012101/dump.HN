Things done there are dull and boring, exercises are repetitive and do not teach anything substantial other than applying another algorithm shown by a teacher. I found out that almost everyone did not really understand not only the problems that were told to solve, but also the solutions they gave -- and it was hard to blame them, for it was mainly teacher's and education system's fault not to give them thorough understanding of what is math really about.<p>My idea? Dump all that algorithmic crap and teach real problem solving. Do not punish for bad performance, because it is really hard to actually come up with a solution to a problem, and this skill is not something that can be learned by doing the same thing over and over again. Problem solving also require less concepts to be introduced and internalized, so more time can be spent on actual thinking and discussing, and less on preparations.<p>This kind of math course may seem not to prepare to good to ""university level"" math, but in fact it is quite opposite -- universities have to start almost from scratch anyway, and it is easier to teach new concepts a person who has a good understanding what math really is, than a person who only know tens of algorithms, used in high school to grind all kind of ""problems"" given there.",1301563705

And how long you expect to continue doing said tasks.<p>That said, I would always err on the side of automating - at least some of the tasks. Take the low hanging fruit and tackle those first.<p>For example, I send out a weekly report containing a bunch of metrics sourced from our website monitoring tool. It took me a couple of days to automate that, but it saves me a good hour every week (and means I don't make mistakes copying and pasting figures which I used to with alarming regularity). It also means that my Monday mornings can start immediately without pounding through a repetitive task.",1301563149

However, there are bad people in the world who intentionally do bad things. This can be done with surprisingly little knowledge and ability, and such devices are commercially available. The GPS system is fine; the problem is that anyone can flick a switch and mess with it. The US military does not have some kind of magic device to stop that happening.<p>""The GPS system may be an exception to the purity argument.""<p>It is very definitely not. With one device I can mess with everyone's nav system, if everyone uses GPS. If there was a mix of systems being used; GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, the forthcoming COMPASS, the regional Beidou and other such regional systems, LORAN and eLORAN ground-based systems, inertial navigation systems (Which aren't brilliant but are getting better) and various other options, I will have a much, much harder time of messing with everyone's navigation.",1301562572

The first paragraph talked about how Obama is interested in emulating China's and India's focus on science and engineering.  The second paragraph says the Startup America plan needs more substance: a way for foreign-born entrepreneurs to start companies here and a leveling of the playing field for entrepreneurs wanting to solve government problems.<p>I don't know about the situation in India, but here in China the barriers for foreign-born entrepreneurs starting companies and the barriers for entrepreneurs wanting to solve government problems are both very high.  The US already has the comparative advantage in this regard.  Isn't the real disadvantage that most Americans aren't very interested in science or engineering careers?",1301562373

Certainly, if I can connect to visa.com within a reasonable time, Anonymous would have no meaningful trouble DDoS'ing it. Requiring a new unit of work for every new connection may or may not allow legitimate requests while making DDoS infeasible; the linked Wikipedia page gives to some papers that may help you build such an economic model, if you want to look at this.

Google ""dos extortion"" for much more, including Symantec saying that DoS extortion was no longer profitable in 2007.<p>I'm not sure you actually need IPv6; can't you just use 2^15 (optionally unused) ports in the registered ports range (1024-49151) for your scheme? If you're worried about firewalls blocking traffic to such uncommon ports, you could use a single port on a class C network (256 hosts) if you're willing to blacklist anyone connecting to the wrong host (which runs a risk of wrongly blacklisting people behind a NAT).<p>Have you chosen which PoW function you are going to use yet?

Questions are also welcome.<p>Of course, you're aware that this proposal is never going to be implemented, right? People won't accept extra connection latency, it requires every single resolver to be updated (because you need to block clients that didn't do the PoW), it's incompatible with caching, etc. I don't think this is that big of a problem - it's just an exercise - but don't expect to convince the BIND maintainers.<p>I do think the idea is quite cool, though.",1301562130

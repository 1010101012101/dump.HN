2807929,comment,2806730,2806730,2,0,peteri,,,"I have to say that I think Toni is wrong over symbian. It has the same set of basic problems that Windows Mobile 6.5 had, basically it's a system designed for resistive screens in a capacitive world.<p>Nokia needed to make that decision to kill off Symbian in the same way that Microsoft made the decision to kill off Windows Mobile in both cases there is only so much lipstick you can put on a pig.<p>The decision process then becomes what OS choices are available to you:<p>Maemo - Dead killed by Meego but I rather liked the N900 I have and in many ways it's a better OS for hackers than Android (On the N900 it came with a terminal, a copy of vi and getting root is a simple download from the repositories) .<p>Meego - Alive but unclear if it's ever going to be good enough and it's probably at least a year away from shipping commercially (note this is at decision time presumably around December last year) Judging by the progress on the back port to the N900 it's still not all there. <a href=""http://wiki.meego.com/ARM/N900/Status"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.meego.com/ARM/N900/Status</a> (see the notes on receiving a call)<p>iOS4 - Good luck there<p>Android - Definite maybe here but then you're in a very me too space.<p>Windows Phone 7 - Plausible and possibly Nokia are able to push Microsoft into giving more customisation than other vendors.<p>If you're the Nokia board that leaves you with three options - Meego,Android and WP7. I think they've done the right thing by putting Meego on the back burner and going with WP7.<p>Toni seems to have a hard on that Elop is a trojan horse, sadly while I don't think announcing the death of Symbian was a great idea it's really hard to see why anyone with an iPhone or Android phone would buy a Symbian phone. The N8 burnt a lot of folks with it's poor firmware (and slow upgrades) So I think Nokia was ALWAYS going to fail hard this year.<p>I like the look of the N9 and N950 but after my N900 experience I wouldn't buy either of them as who (outside of the OSS folks) is going to develop for them commercially?<p>WP7 has it's problems the Mango update took too long and I don't believe that tethering is properly supported (some phones have a ""modem"" mode in their test menu) but when I've had a quick play with it I rather liked it (and I haven't heard many users complaining) The developer tools and APIs seem to be getting there.<p>Finally I would like to point out that when I buy a Nokia phones (9500 & N900) the OS seems to get killed so I'm not very trusting in Nokias long term plans.",1311695964

2807926,comment,2805658,2806257,7,0,barts,,,"The thing that sticks out the most to me in Andy's critique is how he skims over the fact that news sites currently have a lot of ads to keep them afloat, and removing them requires dismantling entire ads sales departments, marketing departments, industry standards for ad sizes that must be available on your site for advertisers to even want to talk to you, and the bottom line: huge chunks of money (especially for big homepage campaigns).<p>This is something that every designer (and developer) at every media organization has to struggle with. And it speaks to what you said about someone looking in from the outside.

2807916,comment,2806145,2806762,2,0,Chris_Newton,,,"The trouble with this article, and indeed many of the posts in this HN discussion, is that what certain web frameworks have decided to call MVC has only a tenuous relationship to real MVC.<p>The point of MVC, as originally practised in Smalltalk and used by numerous GUI libraries ever since, is the three-way separation of concerns between the underlying data, the presentation of that data, and interactions that change that data. It's an elegant way to reduce dependencies, in particular eliminating dependencies from the model onto any part of the UI, by having some parts of the system push information and others pull it. It remains a useful basic architecture for interactive GUI applications to this day.<p>In the modern corruption used by various web frameworks, three subsystems have the same names, and that is about where the similarity ends. The three components are typically arranged in a linear stack, with linear dependencies. The responsibilities for the ""controller"" are very different.<p>This leads to comments like the parent post:<p><pre><code>    He had me up until the part about models talking directly to views.\n    I was nodding along until then. While I agree that the application\n    business logic should be in models, but the controller needs to be\n    that traffic cop, only asking for what the view needs and then\n    handing it to the view.\n</code></pre>\nIf your view can't present data from your model without going via a controller, then you simply aren't using MVC. Your design might be perfectly reasonable and do its job well, but please call it something else.",1311695833

For Windows systems it allows to enter any password protected profile without any knowledge of the password.

Your history of C++ is correct but the modern version looks completely different.<p><i>I had my fling with programming language design with KnowledgeTool and a subsequent project. At the time I looked at the literature of programming language design and was not impressed. To me the literature looked like it was just rehashing old ideas back to Algol, looked like 'research' in cooking that was just remixing Escoffier's collection of sauces.</i><p>I completely agree that PL spent (and is spending) a huge amount of time rehashing old ideas but I think all the effort spent on the Fortran legacy (including C, C++, Algol, and PL/I) was a waste of time -- it took almost 20 years to get around to rehashing all the old ideas in LISP, which was a much better idea anyway.<p>As far as the Microsoft stack goes, I see no problem. My own experience with the internals of SQL Server makes me extremely reticent about using it myself but my time spent with the MS VC++ and CLR teams has made me very impressed with the entire .NET stack.<p><i>All this started just because Google asked me what my favorite programming language was and I said PL/I instead of C++ like they wanted. My answer was fine. The HR-recruiter rube didn't see PL/I on their list of acceptable answers and ended the interview. That was Google's error, not mine.</i><p>If that is actually what happened then I agree.

2807776,comment,2806771,2807561,7,0,mdasen,,,"Estoppel is meant as a protection against the following situation.  Sun tells Google, ""Don't worry.  Android doesn't infringe on our intellectual property.""  Google then relies on that information when making future plans for its operating system.  Sun then comes back and says, ""we're suing you for infringing on our intellectual property.""  Sun (now Oracle) would be reasonably estopped from collecting damages because they had earlier made assertions that Google reasonably relied upon in their decisions.*<p>Google's lawyers note that Sun offered to license Java to Google (<a href=""http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/072211-google-sun-offered-to-license.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.networkworld.com/news/2011/072211-google-sun-offe...</a>). Therefore, there is no reasonable way that Google could try to claim estoppel.  Google was aware that Sun believed that Google needed a license.  Therefore, there is no possibility that Google believed that Sun was saying that Google's Java implementation didn't infringe on Sun's IP.<p>There's a distinct difference between that scenario and the one that occurred.  In the hypothetical, Sun has stated a fact ""your implementation of Java doesn't infringe"".  Later, Sun changes that fact ""your implementation of Java <i>does</i> infringe"".  With what Sun's CEO has said, one can create a dialogue that <i>doesn't</i> contradict itself.  ""We're happy you're using Java""; ""We're still happy you're using Java, but you have to pay for its usage or code around our patents like we said before when we offered you a license for Java.""<p>*Estoppel is meant to make sure that people can't trick you into situations (and often times requires some proof that the person being estopped had that motive).  For example, let's say that Sun had gotten together in a board room and started saying, ""we'll tell people that there are no patents on Java and they can all use it for no charge and then later, once they've all started using it due to our assurance that there are no patents on it, we'll change our mind and sue them for patent infringement.""

Similar to drug addicts and the RIAA is similarly trying to keep on selling their stuff like a pusher. Sometimes those people aren't loyal and will get it somewhere else but they come back.<p>Obviously there are other types of people. Most pirates I know or from similar threads on reddit and elsewhere that I saw who won't buy from iTunes or go to the movies would not even buy it even if they couldn't pirate the movie. They pirate stuff just for fun, they don't really care about the stuff enough to ever pay for it (or they can't pay for it and when they can maybe they will change their style.) Reformed pirates do exist.<p>You are always  going to have dead weight like them and the RIAA is wasting it's time going after them because those aren't the ones usually getting caught (they use whatever newest way to get the stuff which the RIAA has a hard time of tracking). What they do by suing is get the people who do both aka your customers. The average person who will buy and copy once in a while off crapy p2p software that should be called spy tools for the RIAA. But with the ease of use of iTunes and other such service, it's becoming a larger waste of time to copy then to get them from legally licensed sites. Amazon MP3 is lightyears easier than bittorent and that has converted a lot of people to paying.<p>As for Movies, there currently isn't a good service out there (Netflix is ok but selection isn't that great) on par with the offerings for legal music sites.",1311693792

Due to its very nature it can't look forward, it can only hill-climb. Since evolution can't re-architect things, it gets stuck in local maxima all the time.<p>We can be reasonably sure of evolution's inefficiencies after looking at some some examples. Problems like the laryngeal nerve and backwards vertebrate retina are commonly brought up in these sorts of debates, but they forget that evolution doesn't even look at the vast majority of solution-space. It limits itself to squishy things in the discipline of biology. For example, neurons run at 10-200Hz and conduct signals at 0.000001c. Other substrates like silicon and diamond are much faster.<p>A human visual cortex has billions of neurons doing complicated procedures (edge-detection, FFTs, motion-detection, etc). But only a tiny fraction of humans can multiply two 4-digit numbers without the aid of pen and paper. Had the human brain been designed by a human, every programmer in the world would scream, ""Why didn't you give us an API you idiot?!""<p>Of course, we'd also complain about the brain's lack of 4G, since evolution never invented a radio.",1311693518

Data on maximal life span, also expressed as a function of body weight, were used to calculate adult life span, wherever possible, by subtracting the cognate value for age at first reproduction. Then a regression analysis of adult life span as a function of age at first reproduction was made. In both cases global regression lines (i.e., for whole data sets) were computed by standard least squares and by a robust method, as well as local regression lines for subgroups classified by taxonomic and ecological criteria. The slopes of the various regression lines were found to vary widely as a function of the method of classification. This result argues against the notion that the ratio of life history variables is a constant, or that one life history variable is likely to be a simple function of another. The results for bats are anomalous, in that age at first reproduction appears to be independent of body weight (over about two orders of magnitude). It is concluded that a full understanding of life history variables, such as maximal life span and age at maturity, is likely to depend on combined physiological, ecological, and evolutionary insights.\nKeywords: maximal life span; age at maturity; regression analysis; mammals",1311693444

2807666,comment,2805378,2806106,3,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"Pardon a bit of advertising rhetoric. Let me make a couple of more precise statements:<p>1. Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript, dislikes its syntax (he was famously told to ""make it look like Java"" even though its semantics are derived from Smalltalk and Lisp) and has become a fan of CoffeeScript. He blurbed the book and, as CTO of the Mozilla corporation, has been pushing to develop tools for debugging languages that compile to JavaScript within Firefox.<p>2. CoffeeScript doesn't fix all of JavaScript's quirks. Roughly half of what you'll find at wtfjs.com is applicable to CoffeeScript. (Most of the other half involves `==`.) As JS gets faster, it'll become more practical to use JS as a VM to run languages that offer niceties like every number being a BigDecimal. But for now, CoffeeScript is an excellent compromise: Fewer quirks and much less boilerplate than JS, with little to no loss in efficiency when used properly.",1311692831

The best purchasers and moviegoers may also be pirates, but overall the movie and music industry would be making more money if it weren't for rampant pirating.<p>I read a thread in Reddit the other day about this topic and there were a few people who thought pirating has caused them to make extra purchases (try before you buy).  However, many more of the responses were opposite and some had completely stopped buying CDs, renting DVDs and going to the theater.  So if one person rents a DVD every week and now pirates, there would have to be someone who rented 50 MORE DVDs (or purchased) than they would have had there been no pirating options.<p>I agree there probably is a correlation between people who pirate heavily and people who purchase (because they're probably fanatics).  However, I don't believe that they're heavy purchasers BECAUSE of pirating but would probably purchase even more if they didn't have the option to pirate.",1311692716

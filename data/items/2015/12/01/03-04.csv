10653539,comment,10645686,10653154,0,0,jordigh,,,"> Sorry jordigh, but in what area?<p>You are focussing just on gender. There are many other parts that make up a language.<p>I gave an example which you ignored. English has pretty complicated consonant clusters, such as in &quot;angsts&quot;. It has two liquids, r and l, which many other languages do not distinguish. Depending on the dialect, it has 12 to 14 vowels, not counting diphthongs (okay, fine French has 16 vowels).<p>That&#x27;s just phonology. Let&#x27;s discuss some syntax. Here is something I hear French speakers mess up all the time in English: number agreement. Why does the verb &quot;run&quot; have to have an &quot;s&quot; in some cases but not in others? While French also has conjugations, large parts of them are only written, not pronounced. Thus, French speakers have trouble with number agreement in &quot;the cats run&quot; and the &quot;the cat runs&quot;.<p>English has a pretty complicated phrasal verb system. For example, knock up, knock out, and knock over all mean completely different things and are unrelated to the meaning of ordinary &quot;knock&quot;. English has a completely foreign usage of the verb &quot;do&quot;, which is used for affirmation in a way that no other language does, for example &quot;I do mean this&quot;.<p>I can keep on going. If I am allowed to compare English with Russian (for example, English has a complicated system of articles, which Russian very simply lacks), with Japanese (Japanese only has 5 vowels), or with Chinese (English has complicated inflexions for nouns and conjugations for verbs, which Chinese lacks), I can find lots of other relative complexities with other languages.<p>And all of this without talking about the weird spelling systems (there are more than 2) that English has cobbled together from all of the languages it has borrowed spellings from over the centuries.",1448941866

JScript was totally proprietary.<p>Another aspect is that TypeScript is seeking to be a strict superset of JavaScript that evolves as JavaScript does (something that wasn&#x27;t really happening in the JScript days) and is focused on specifically providing static types and tooling for types in JS. It&#x27;s not a general &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot; kind of thing at all, but rather a very targeted tool.<p>TypeScript is really one of the most JavaScript-y languages that compile to JS. Most of the compile-to-JS languages are more radical divergences from JS.<p>JS is not going to be replaced (though WebAssembly[1] will likely become an additional compile target), but compile-to-JS is going to continue to grow in popularity. Already, many people are compiling future-JS to present-day-JS.<p>The browser vendors have found that the standards evolve best when people can actually write code against the standards <i>before</i> the standards are hardened. Compile-to-JS tools help with that. If optional static types and type inference become very popular via TypeScript and Flow, JS itself may evolve to support those features and then we&#x27;ll have that standard.<p>Microsoft is a better player on the web today than they have ever been before.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/WebAssembly/design"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/WebAssembly/design</a>",1448939487

91389,comment,91311,91356,0,0,leolin,,,"Yes indeed. $3.99 can get you a book at a used bookstore. But you might not be able to find the one you want immediately. Used bookstores are for explorers, not buyers.<p>Besides, $3.99 isn't enough for a popular title or a hardcover. However you can get them through swapping with a flat fee.<p>--<p>We'll focus on one thing and make it work. In our case it's book swapping. If our service is good then we'll have users. I don't think there's other way.",1198122345
91388,comment,91140,91381,0,0,staticshock,,,"in the browser, javascript's REPL is essentially the address bar. you can type in javascript:alert(2+2) to output 4, or javascript:void(code) just to run an expression and swallow the output. to evaluate expressions more complex than a one liner you can inline a function, javascript:alert((function(){var x = 2; return x+x;})()). that's how bookmarklets work.",1198122335

Find some people who have a lot of photos that they can never find time to organize for sharing.  Point them to my site.  When a popular site is using Scheme on the JVM, you using it isn't such a far-out proposal any more.",1198121979
91386,comment,91206,91376,0,0,brlewis,,,"I'm very happy with Kawa Scheme.  It's very fast.  It's stable, and has everything from R5RS that I care about.  The only drawback is it's so good that I don't experience enough pain to push me to update to new versions.  I see on the mailing list all the good improvements, but I'm still stuck at Kawa 1.7.",1198121037

91382,comment,91140,91317,0,0,michaelneale,,,"I would love to use scheme, especially on the JVM. But its a bit like going nude on a beach. Don't really want to be the first one in the crowd to do it. <p>Hmmm.... did I just type that or think it ?",1198120464
91381,comment,91140,91265,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Not only that, but its in a useful form in the most common client platforms today (browser, and flash ! - of a fashion). <p>In many cases javascript is fullfilling the promises of lisp. Complete with REPL on the client platform itself (firebug, for instance).<p>May not be what you expect, but its there, its its not too shabby.",1198120335

91379,comment,91260,91372,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"The BPMN and the ""diagram until you puke"" UML guys are just beating the heck outta the art of communication using a diagram. It's such an easy concept, why do folks have to go and keep adding more and more stuff until nobody likes it anymore?<p>I completely understand the gist of the article. Diagramming is supposed to be a tool for communication, collaboration, and discussion. But instead it becomes some kind of tool to control the universe. Sometimes I wonder if we only need about 1-5% of all of the tools we use. The rest is just overkill.",1198119909

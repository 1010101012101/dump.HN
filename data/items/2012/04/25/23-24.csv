3891708,comment,3888114,3891558,1,0,vibrunazo,,,"I agree the evolution of mobile will be basically a console. In fact, I said in my original post that the next popular consoles will run iOS/Android. And these tablets without the screen already exist. They're called Google TV and Apple TV (tho Apple TV would still need app store). Put more power, a controller, a game friendly UI and you got a real console competitor. Expect that to happen, at most by 2013.<p>Mobile does have big advantages over console, just as these had over arcade. A) The ecosystem lock is huge. Having all your existing apps, games and settings, instantly transfer seamlessly to your living room is something current consoles cannot reproduce (yet, tho msft is working on it). B) they're mobile after all. Playing an AAA game on your living room is nice, but what about when you're out? You can bring your tablet with you.<p>I agree with you that the real issue for steam is whether current stores are gonna need them. Unfortunately for them, I don't think they got much leverage in this negotiation. They don't have any games that work on iOS, Android or WP. Even if they partner with MS (whose got a week ecosystem right now). The combination of both of them would still be weak compared to iOS and Android. I honestly don't know what they could do. They'd have to pull off something brilliant. But choosing to work on linux this late in the game, gives me a hint they might be out of brilliant ideas.",1335398341

In fact, I will allow you to go and grab a cold one from the fridge before starting.<p>...<p>My first foray into business ( I was 14): being an Amway distributor. It taught me the value of salesmanship. I lacked it, and made me focus on it for years.<p>Then it was the idea of selling bottled water at a local political event. It failed because me and my partner arrived there too late!\nIt also taught me about funding, because we borrowed some money for that. Money that we had to pay afterwards. I did, however, drink lots of refreshing water that week.<p>My first auto repair business. I took out a loan to buy equipment before even having one customer. Taught me the importance of getting customers before buying anything. Lost 5K in that one (at age 21).<p>My second auto repair business. I focused on doing on-site auto repair (like yourmechanic.com (the Y-combinator funded startup)). It failed because I lacked the marketing resources. Also, that business model has razor thin profit margins.<p>The shrink wrap business that almost was. It failed when I ordered $2K worth of product for my first client ( a family member, no less), and had to eat the cost (still have the prodcut!). He (his company) backed off, and left me broke. \nTaught me to put everything in writing and to get deposits.<p>My first tech startup, which was about selling websites to doctors. I did not believe in the idea and it led me to waste time cold-calling doctors (well, their staff). Taught me to not do anything unless I really believe in the idea.<p>A mobile carwash service that I had for a couple of months (still have the equipment...). This one was an eye opener. First, it taught me the importance of pricing. I was asking for $5 per car wash and it drove customers away. Second, it was a business I wanted to operate but I did not want to do. I hate washing cars.<p>I'm missing a few, but all of my failures have led me to really sit back and negatively judge every idea I get. Innovafy was only born after I thought about it for months. Even though it has not launched, most of the focus has been on getting the marketing and customers, and the other on getting the software done. For me, getting the customers are first, then comes the software. Forget the MVP, get me the a bunch of people who will pay to have the MVP developed before even a line of code is written. This is what I cal MOP (Money Oriented Programming). Innovafy is at that stage right now, getting people to pay before they even see the service. How so? Turns out that being an avid student of marketing for more than 20 years has proven itself very worthy.<p><i></i>*<p>I could publish an ebook if the interest is there.",1335398014

Facebook is pretty directly competing with google already and getting ad dollars that would have otherwise gone to Google.

Amazon S3 would be a good way to host them, or you can write them directly to a directory on your web server either will do, Amazon will probably be faster and more resilient than your webserver. Dollar for dollar, you just can't scale and provide services like Amazon and the other do, at the price point that they are competing at. I always advice people that don't have infrastructure yet, to not get in that game. It has been turned into a commodity that few small companies can do at anywhere near the quality or speed per dollar that the providers can. If you want deep control of your systems go with Amazon and set your server up as an image on EC2 while using S3 for cheap storage. If you are not so concerned with having control of every little detail, go with StackMob or Heruko, just remember that these services have their own API's and platform, it can be a pain to port the back end away from them should you choose to.<p>2. Some apps are probably storing them on a flat file structure while others may be databasing them, the latter can cause performance degradation. If you need to store them in a searchable or index-able datastore it is better to store the attributes you need in a datastore with the filename and then return the path to the file in the filesystem. Also some are probably prefetching while others are not, you are going to have to look at your application requirements and see if you can reliability predict what images the user is going to access, if you can and the likelihood that they will look at the image is high, you should prefetch them.<p>3. Why an IOS developer? Why not find someone good with jQuery mobile. Most of the mobile web toolkits can provide 90% of the ondevice features and all you have to do to make them a native app that can be provided in app stores is create an application with a web view type controller in it, and point it to the HTML file. By doing this, you just have to have a small launcher application build for iOS, Android and whatever else comes along.",1335397945

Which is to say, for every 8 dollars you spend you have one less hour of time.<p>P.S the counter intuitive property of looking at it like this, is that if you are spending more monthly, it also takes <i>more</i> money to loose an hour. But this is due to the fact that you have fewer hours to start with, and thus each hour is worth more.",1335395440

In fact you may as well plug it into your HD TV too and you now have your ""TV tablet"" that you leave next to your TV (in the same way that you have a dedicated HTPC instead of plugging your laptop in every time). Then somebody else comes along and says ""hey all of these people are buying tablets <i>just</i> to plug into their TV, I wonder if they would buy a tablet without a screen"" and thus the whole cycle starts over.<p>I'm not sure that the console/arcade analogy holds, Arcade games had a bigger barrier to play. You had to physically move yourself to a place that contained arcade machines (whilst dodging teenage drugdealers) and stick money into the machine every time you died because the arcade owner had to cover the rent on this massive building (this meant the games were usually designed so that you died <i>a lot</i>). With a console or PC you can sit in the comfort of your own home and play for free (once you have bought the game).You can also save the game and resume from where you left off last time, a feature critical for longer, more complex games and missing from arcade machines.<p>The real issue here is whether the platform providers store (play store, app store, windows store etc) will do away with the need for Steam altogether and if it only had temporary value because MS did not have a compelling alternative at the time.",1335395009

Unless lead by someone who is visionary, charismatic and genuinely interested in advancing the notions of community and free for all that attract the moderators in the first place (which Ellen Pao is demonstrably not), the moderators will rightly ask why they are doing all this work to greatly enrich other people.",1436101186

Third hint: Those lawsuits have stated that some PoC get boosts from the admissions process and other PoC get docked points.  Yet this cartoon treats all PoC as a single homogenous group.",1436101082

There are a lot of reasons to be annoyed and most of those have nothing to do with the cause, but the means employed.<p>Riddle me this: Let&#x27;s say some tech company has to match a man/woman quota of at least 40% on a CS position. (This is a pretty common theme in various places)<p>Going by the numbers in this post, there&#x27;s a 1.6% ratio in the author&#x27;s class. Let&#x27;s be <i>extremely</i> generous and say there&#x27;s a 9:1 male/female ratio in CS.<p>With those numbers, there&#x27;s a 30% skew in favour of female employees. In a sector with a 9:1 male ratio, that means one in three male employee is rejected because of numbers. The real ratio is actually MUCH higher, remember. And on the other side of the equation, female employees would be very aggressively sought after because positions are not actually easy to fill and just because you can find the bodies doesn&#x27;t mean the employees are good. Is this where we want to end up?<p>End sidetrack. There&#x27;s a lot of causes out there. Discrimination, everything. But feminism, I think, annoys more than others because it promotes unhealthy &quot;fixes&quot; such as this one above. You don&#x27;t want to <i>force</i> people into a new belief system, you want to <i>change</i> their belief system. The former is super awkward for places where discrimination doesn&#x27;t happen, and imho just perpetuates the issue.<p>You want more women in CS? Make technology look like less of a boy&#x27;s club at an early age (and leading into tech education) and wait 15 years for the results. I think the Minecraft kids generation will yield some pretty fantastic surprises on that level.",1436097755

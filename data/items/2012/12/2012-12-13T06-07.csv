If you were going to find goods in the USSR it was going to be in Moscow. In parallel many Russian cities of 100,000 were inhospitable, isolated, and dull places. Nevertheless Russia is a large country and if free travel was allowed key industries such as mining or wheat production would disappear. In modern Russia large areas that were cultivated in Soviet times (due to this system) remain underutilized. Lastly finding work was never a problem in the USSR and hence anybody transferring would be likely to find work as long as they were a legal resident (not working was criminal). To counter any potential demographic shift the Soviet authorities made it difficult to move from rural area to the city. A similar system existed in China.",1355381437

4914626,comment,4912884,4914625,4,0,gfodor,,,"Now lets talk about Hall Pass. This is a pretty neat thing and I first want to point out that this is really innovative work and could actually be a very useful thing for your school. Hell, I could see some people starting companies around such a simple but obvious idea that technology could improve, so hats off!<p>A few points on the design though. First, my guess is most of the time, people are going to get hall passes for one of the options in the ""List"" view. So, instead of having the ""Where to?"" selection be a text box, you can make it a spinning selector (like the date selector in Calendar, or the time selector for an Alarm.) I like the design of your custom ""List"" box, similar to your ""Jump"" view, but it's very different than the rest of the app and remember: if you're being clever like this, you probably need to simplify! iOS already has controls for this type of problem: the spinner. You can still customize the look of the spinner a bit if you want to add some flash, but you should start there.<p>If you are really worried about people needing to specify one-off destinations that are not on your list (and so the spinner will not have their choice), you can always include an ""Other"" selection in the spinner and then let them type something. If you go with the spinner route, you should change the field on the form from a text-box to a nice, large, tappable button that lets you click to open the spinner and then the label is replaced with your destination. In general, you should always do what you can to make it so people do not have to type on their phone, unless they really, really have to.<p>The minutes thing is rigged up very well, though I would suggest perhaps also going for a spinner here since that is the standard way to input time duration. Here's the reason: most of the time people do not need minute-level precision (like say 17 minutes or 29 minutes) Instead, they need things at 5-minute precison. For a hall pass, which is probably no more than 2 hours long, that's only 60 minutes / 5 minutes * 2 hours = 24 choices, which is a perfectly fine number of choices to put in a spinner.<p>So, for Hall Pass, you can have two buttons, ""Where to?"" and ""For how long?"" that open spinners, one with a list of places (and maybe ""Other"") and one with a list of 24 time intervals ranging from 5 minutes to two hours (there is actually a built in iOS spinner mode to select time intervals I believe, search around the documentation.) Your two buttons in hall pass are a little weird since your other tabs follow the style of most iOS apps and have buttons in the navigation bar. I would move ""clear"" and ""submit"" to the left and right corners of the navigation bar. Also, its weird that you have two ways to ""clear"" a hall pass, though this might be a quirk with your school.<p>The Edline tab is totally fine :)<p>Finally, some high level points on the design. One of the things about iOS design is you should generally tend to be subtle. First on color. Your app has highly saturated red navigation bars, mixed with bright blue buttons and segmented controls, and the Hall Pass has red and green buttons for clear and submit. First, you need to choose a color scheme. Red isn't bad, but I'd dial down the saturation a bit since bright red is a danger color. (In users' minds, red means ""Be careful!"" So, you should only create red buttons when <i>important</i> things are going to be destroyed.) If you are going to choose red as your main title bar color, your segment controls should complement it. When designing an app, you generally choose a <i>palette</i> of colors that complement each other. (Google color palette or color scheme) So, I would change your segmentation control (if you keep it) to be a lighter tone of red or a grey in order to match the background of the table view. Also, your instructional banners are cyan -- they should also match the main palette of the app. Blue and cyan can complement red if they are used in very small amounts, but usually it's a bad idea.<p>Also, you need to be consistent with lighting, layout, and style. I'm not sure where your buttons came from for Hall Pass but they are a little weird and are not standard iOS-styled buttons. Finally, one more nit pick: in Assignments, the blue box at the top to add assignments can use a little adjustment. First, the cyan background does not match the red theme, as I mentioned, but more subtly I think it is a little too small as the ""Tap here"" text is up too far against the edges of the control. As I've mentioned earlier, you should always try to stick to convention: if there are other text boxes you've seen, make yours the same size.<p>One last point. Your launch screen has a logo for your app. This is totally fine and it's not really a solid point of criticism, but it's something to think about. What Apple encourages people to do is to make their launch screen be a image of their first screen, but without any data (since it needs to be the same every time.) In your case, it would be the ""Calendar"" tab, with nothing in the grey area at the bottom. So, remove the table view, take a screenshot, and make that your launch screen. When users launch the app they will see the calendar tab as the app opens and the table view will ""pop in"". Check out the other apps on your iPhone like notes and clock to see this in action.<p>I hope this has been helpful. Don't take this as an indication this isn't great work. You are more competent at iOS programming just by looking at this than many wannabe hackers. Great job. You got a lot of details right. I know how much work it was to get all this working, even though it probably seems simple to people who pick it up and just start using it. Just like when you clean your house the easiest thing to notice is that you left a sock on the floor, when you build software the easiest thing to notice is where it needs work, not all the work that went into what is there already.<p>Main things to remember: go with the flow, if something has been done before, just copy it (and maybe tweak it), don't be too clever. Think about what your users will actually use (do they really need to be able to type in 17 minutes in Hall Pass? Do they really need to be able to switch between 6th and 7th grade schedules in a single tap?) Every control you use or layout you design has consequences of what it makes easier, and in turn what it makes harder. Especially on a tiny screen like a phone. Always think about what things your design makes harder, not just what it makes easier. For example, if you add a segmentation bar, that makes switching easy, but moves some information off the screen, so you have to scroll to get to it. Also, if you add a segmentation bar for one thing, it means you can't add one for something else that might be better for it. If you use a spinner instead of a text box, choosing those choices is easier but one-offs are harder. Which is more important? Finally, don't be afraid to throw things out. Most of the feedback I've posted requires you to remove a lot of stuff. There's a lot less moving parts. In fact, by the end, you might actually have <i>less</i> code than you do now, despite making the app much better. This is normal and is a good sign that you are doing things correctly. If you are always adding new stuff and never removing stuff (or always adding more than you remove) then you very well might be going down the wrong track.<p>If you've read this far, I've got some questions for <i>you</i>. How did you get into this? Were your parents involved? How could we get more kids like you to try hacking on their iPhones?<p>Great work and keep it up!

4914625,comment,4912884,4912884,5,0,gfodor,,,"Nice work! I played around with it a bit, and couldn't get it to crash. It seems like a genuinely useful app and you focused on building things that people could and would actually use, and that's a great skill to have and a lot of people could learn from it.<p>I'm worried however that everyone here is not being critical enough since you are an 8th grader. The only way you will get better is to get honest feedback, so here's mine. Most of my feedback is design oriented, since I can't see your code.<p>First up is calendar tab. First issue is that tapping on the table cells do nothing, but give me a blue highlight. You should disable selections on these since they do not actually drill in anywhere. Your choice to split the events into Today & Upcoming is a good idea. For Today events, you put the time, for upcoming events, you put the date in the secondary info, which makes sense. I would suggest for upcoming events, you look into making the dates more readble. For example, instead of ""12/13/12"", it would be useful to say ""Tomorrow"". Or instead of ""12/15/12"", say ""Next Wednesday."" This is more work for the computer, but less work for your users to do in their heads. (Anytime there is something you find like this, do it!) For farther out things, include the day of the week, since (as far as my dusty middle school memory goes) the day of the week really matters a lot as far as your schedule goes. Finally, the Feedback button doesn't really belong here. I realize there is currently not a better place to put it, so I don't really have a good answer for you, but usually Feedback is not on the first screen of an app since it is a secondary or tertiary function and that real estate is primary real estate.<p>Next up, schedule. I like your choice of using the segmented controls for grade selection, but here's something to think about: how often does your grade change? Only once a year. Segment controls are useful if you need to continually switch between things. I noticed you <i>do</i> save the selection, which is really smart! But, a better approach might be to ask the user when they first visit this tab what grade they are in, save that, and then provide a button in the navigation bar to change that setting. (You can try using an action sheet for this.) This way, you free up that real estate on the screen to show more information instead of having the segmented navigation taking up precious space.<p>Also, in the schedule tab, you have a really, really long list of stuff. In fact, you realized this, so you added a Jump button! Along the way, if you are building something like this, and it feels like you need to build something clever like that, it usually is a sign there might be a way to simplify things. Here's what I would to do start. First, you can get rid of the segmentation control like I mentioned above. Now, you could use a segmentation control instead to choose the type of schedule you are in. The problem with that though is that there are five types of schedules, and that's a pretty large number of choices for a segmentation control. But, even more importantly, just like your grade, you probably don't change your schedule type very often! In fact, as you noticed since you put it at the top, unlike your grade (where everyone is probably evenly split between grade), most people all are on a normal schedule, and then everyone changes to weird ones once in a while.<p>A better format for your schedule screen might be something along the lines of the weather app, where you flick to page between the different schedules. You can start off on the Normal schedule, and then swipe between pages. This is a pretty intuitive interface and makes it so the user can jump right to the information they need on the rare occasion they are not in a regular schedule, and removes the need to scroll very far. And it also gets rid of the need for that ""Jump"" button, which is taking up a very useful slot in the nav bar for future features!<p>Next up is assignments. First, lets talk about the ""Manage"" button. When I go into manage, there seem to be only two things I can do: move assignments around or clear the list. I might be wrong here, but I don't see the point of moving assignments around. This might be the first place where you fell into the trap of doing something cool that is not very useful, but I could be wrong. I <i>think</i> the help text said I should be able to delete things, but I couldn't get that to work. The thing that makes sense is the Clear button. This prompts me correctly to clear completed assignments, and does so. Since the rest of the ""Manage"" mode seems not very useful, and modes in general are a bad sign when designing stuff, you should remove the manage mode and just put a ""Clear"" button in the top left corner. Since you are clearing completed assignments, it might make sense to try putting ""Clear Completed"" on the button, but that could be too long so I would try it and see how it looks. But right now, hitting ""Clear"" is a bit scary, since it makes me worry that it might actually clear <i>all</i> my assignments. (Your pop-up confirmation of course is an important thing and I was glad to see you added it, but users should be able to have as good an idea as possible of what they are getting into when they tap a button!)<p>Now, when I am not in manage mode there are a few issues. First, I noticed that when I tap on the checkbox this moves between current and completed. This makes sense, but the checkbox is very hard to tap. Instead, leave the checkbox as a way to indicate to the user if things are completed, but make it so i can check off an assignment by tapping anywhere in the entire table cell. One of the most important things in a touch interface is to make sure the tappable areas of the screen are very large and unambiguous. In fact, for many of the controls on the iPhone, the area you can tap is much larger than the on-screen representation. (This type of thing is part the reason Apple had to rebuild their OS from the ground up to be used with fingers instead of mice.)<p>One more thing about Assignments. If I have a Clear button to clear up clutter, then why bother moving things between Current and Completed? Completed is there to prevent cluttering up the Current assignments. You should pick one way to reduce clutter. Here's what I would to. Make this just a simple list with no sections (not current or completed.) Leave your checkboxes in there and tap the cell to check on or off the box. But, don't move anything around when you tap on them, just leave them there checked or unchecked. As long as my list is pretty short, I can still tell at a glance how many assignments I have left to finish. Once it gets too cluttered with finished assignments, the user can clear out the checked ones by clicking a ""Clear"" button at the top. Or, better yet, if you have things this way, you can change that button to say ""Clean Up"", which makes it a little more clear (no pun intended) that when the user clicks that they will not be removing their <i>unchecked</i> assignments. As a bonus, you remove the need for the ""Current Assignments"" bar in the table view, freeing up more room for the list to fit on the screen (which is even more important now since you will have checked off items floating around in the list.)",1355380950

Did Yammer handle their paying customers - we don't know that, but perhaps someone can share their experience as a paid user? In the end, a free software has made no guarantees to you and you knew what you were getting into when you are on free software. Most free versions of things have an important element missing: support. As a non-paying user, your priority of support is next to nothing since you bring no value and only utilize. So what benefit is there in supporting you?<p>Let this be clear: You are not a customer of Yammer, you are a user. Since you're not a customer, Yammer has no reason to help or even give you an explanation. However, it appears their Twitter was updated with their status and that's on you for not finding out how to get support from the free software you're utilizing.

This continues to raise the bar on citizens for even entry-level positions.<p>10 years ago a college degree in business or communications was enough to land a salaried-job.  Now, to obtain a well-paying job straight out of college either a STEM degree or graduate work is usually required.  It is extreme to suggest that citizens either acquire a high-level of education (which many simply cannot complete) or perform work for $2 an hour.",1355378650

If this is really the case, he should totally license out the code, or release it open source. He's saying that what differentiates ""The Magazine"" is not the app, but the publication. If this is the case, then there is no problem with letting other people use his platform to do what they will.",1355378581

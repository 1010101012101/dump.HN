11005287,comment,11001796,11002896,0,0,afarrell,,,"> I first heard about this from one of the developers of the hit game SimCity, who told me that there was a critical bug in his application: it used memory right after freeing it, a major no-no that happened to work OK on DOS but would not work under Windows where memory that is freed is likely to be snatched up by another running application right away. The testers on the Windows team were going through various popular applications, testing them to make sure they worked OK, but SimCity kept crashing. They reported this to the Windows developers, who disassembled SimCity, stepped through it in a debugger, found the bug, and added special code that checked if SimCity was running, and if it did, ran the memory allocator in a special mode in which you could still use memory after freeing it.<p><a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a>",1454216282

11005203,comment,11001693,11001693,0,0,Hixie,,,"My favourite language in FreePascal&#x27;s dialect of ObjectPascal (which is largely derived from the work Borland did with Delphi, which itself is largely derived from Borland&#x27;s Turbo Pascal).<p>It has all the benefits of a modern language -- strong typing, generics, operator overloading, objects, metaclasses, dynamic arrays, interfaces, RTTI, dynamic dispatch, method pointers, type helpers, true modules, fast compile times, preprocessor directives, pretty large set of libraries from the community, etc -- and all the benefits of a compiled language -- compiles to pretty small binaries, small memory footprint at runtime, tight control over memory allocation and layout, trivial ability to shell out to assembler when necessary, etc. It builds to pretty much every platform under the sun -- Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, MSDOS, OS/2, BeOS, Netware, you name it.<p>Some of its features are features I&#x27;ve rarely seen in &#x27;fashionable&#x27; languages. For example the way classes and metaclasses work in FreePascal is great. You can pass classes around by value, constructors can be virtual, even static methods can be virtual.<p>In many ways it&#x27;s really a better C++. For example, what I just said about metaclasses. It has native support for strings. The declaration part of a module (unit interface) is separate from its implementation, so it&#x27;s easy to get an overview of what is exported from a module, but it&#x27;s in the same file and is a first-class-citizen of the language, unlike C++ header files. The syntax also makes a lot more sense than C-like languages. For example, there&#x27;s an explicit keyword to introduce a function, and constructors are named rather than using the type name. (These don&#x27;t sound like interesting features until you&#x27;re trying to navigate the source and you find that searching for a method becomes far easier, or you&#x27;re trying to copy/paste a class and you find you don&#x27;t have to worry about renaming constructors, stuff like that.) It doesn&#x27;t even have to link in a libc, it has its own RTL. (It can link in a libc if you want to use some C or C++ libraries with it though.)<p>There&#x27;s aspects of it that are a bit crufty from having decades of legacy, but it&#x27;s probably still better than C++ in that regard.<p>I don&#x27;t really know why Pascal derivatives haven&#x27;t taken off more.<p>At work I use Dart, which has many of the benefits I listed above, but in the form of a GC&#x27;ed VM-hosted language. Dart&#x27;s a much newer language, though, so regardless of its usage it&#x27;s probably too early to know if it will end up in the &quot;unfashionable&quot; category. Dart has all kinds of cool features like the &quot;..&quot; operator for chaining, the &quot;??=&quot; operator for assignment-if-null, the &quot;with&quot; feature for doing composition rather than inheritance, etc. Also very readable.",1454213945

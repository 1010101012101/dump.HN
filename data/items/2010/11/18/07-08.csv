So often it seem to be one of the very first questions asked, it basically seems to be de rigueur these days (and I can understand why potential employers do it, from a negotiation standpoint). It's not that I think you should try to inflate your current salary or mislead in any way, but it just seems so forward and plain impolite.<p>I'd be interested in any real-life experiences others might have had similar to this and whether you've managed to avoid coming off as sneaky/deceptive/dishonest as a result.",1290066976

They may be able to provide you with an unused room or a landline. I don't know about perceptions in Pakistan, but you may have to consider keeping the support of that institution secret, that is having a different telephone number prefix than the institution that supports you.<p>It's very difficult to get funding for starting Suicide hotlines. Also, it's very difficult to get adaquate training for the people manning the lines, which is _far more important_ than anything else. You do not want to get into a situation where you have a serious case and your telephone agent is not prepared. No, 'just' being a medical doctor or psych student does not prepare you for that. Do not rely on mobile phones, the connection may get dropped anytime.",1290066956

1917196,story,,,4,5,jammur,"Ask HN: Should we demo a half-baked product?",,"I'm working with an early stage startup, and one of the co-founders wants to demo our mobile app to potential customers in a focus group type setting. A few of the people we might demo to will have significant input into volume purchasing decisions within their organization.<p>However, our mobile app, iPad to be specific, is at best half-baked. UI is essentially non existent from a design standpoint. I would say functionality is about 30%, but enough to just barely get the point across. Design wise, it's less than 10%.<p>The co-founder is under the impression that if you're a startup, it's perfectly fine to demo with a ""relatively half-assed"" (his words) product, under the assumption that it will be refined at a later time.<p>In my opinion, if you are demoing to potential customers, you should have something that will impress them (even if not 100% complete), and not rely on them assuming it will get better (and by better, I mean getting to a point where it's actually useable).<p>My question is, am I wrong? Or is it worth it to take the extra time to create a great first impression?",1290066504

Worse, they claim it's the HR departments who are driving this, but that's plainly false - I've asked several very senior HR people and they've never heard of an HR department requiring current salary details along with CVs.<p>I suspect that the agencies are aggressively trying to gather valuable salary data, for their own purposes.",1290066313

Kernels don't need to support horribly designed programs just because they exist, just like they don't need to support horribly designed programs that don't exist yet.  Kernels support an interface and that's it.  If you write code that abuses the interface, get ready to become a regression, and that'll be your own fault.<p>(TBH I have no idea why I got upvoted, it wasn't that insightful, but I stick by what I said)<p>(EDIT: I'm talking about gnome-startup.  That's a stupid regression that never should've happened.  The mplayer performance bug is totally understandable if you're mucking with the scheduler.  What we really need is for someone (distros?) to pick up cgroups and provide a nice UI for it, some sane but nondestructive defaults, etc.  Until then, this is a nice patch that keeps badly behaving programs from dragging down the entire system.

It was truly beautiful protocol -- straight forward, human readable, human writable, and easy to implement.  I wrote desktop apps that connected to web services written in different languages on different platforms and it all worked.<p>Then SOAP happened.  The same philosophy as XML-RPC gone horribly wrong: a human readable format no longer readable by humans, insanely complex, and hard to implement properly (even with the libraries).  Frustrating all around.<p>Although JSON is much simpler than XML, there's no reason why someone couldn't invent something as horrible as SOAP (or XSLT) on top of it.  I can only hope that JSON implementers see the value of keeping things simple.  Perhaps the existence of XML as an ""enterprise"" technology will help differentiate JSON in that way.",1290064933

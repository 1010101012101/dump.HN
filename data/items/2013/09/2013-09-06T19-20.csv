In fact, he sounds a lot like my dad.<p>Why do we care what he thinks here?<p>I am a big android fan, but I definitely see differences in quality between Apple products and others. I don&#x27;t care as much about the polish, though - I like the freedom that android can afford.<p>But comparing Apple now to Microsoft in their hay day is not original, compelling or even that accurate. I mean, they&#x27;re still selling computers, true, but the whole space seems pretty different than how it was when Microsoft was dominating... isn&#x27;t that why Microsoft&#x27;s in trouble in the first place?<p>I guess his point is more general - that Microsoft gained market dominance not through making a superior product, but simply by gaining traction and having the largest consumer base - that may be true, but Microsoft allowed a lot of freedom and control over your devices while Apple does not. Furthermore, Android has dominated the market in terms of numbers for a while now and yet Apple is still in the game - presumably due to the quality of their products, not the fact that lots of people use them.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m probably rambling. My point is simply that Krugman should probably sick to his area of expertise.",1378497514

Some places have the opposite of what you outline, where international calls pay an extra kickback to the telecom/government. Other places, like the US, had things setup so that calling people inside your state was more expensive than calling another state or calling from an international location.<p>This also creates incentives for people to setup grey routes. It&#x27;s common to buy local prepaid SIM cards then hook them up to a GSM bank and sell &quot;international&quot; connectivity to calling card companies. One guy had his setup inside a van, so he could drive around town and avoid being triangulated by the local telco.

I&#x27;m currently working on a large Rails app and we&#x27;ve felt a lot of pain with an off the shelf CI System (Jenkins) and the idea of writing our own CI has been mentioned a few times.<p>For Team City, here&#x27;s the cost breakdown:<p>TeamCity Enterprise = $1,999<p>229 Build agents @ $299/each = $68,741<p>Total yearly license cost ~ $70K<p>This doesn&#x27;t include the time that a team of developers will spend configuring the build and babysitting it during through the early growing pains of adopting a CI system. Also you&#x27;ll probably still need a build/release engineering team to manage the server when you have a team of 100+ devs like Square does.<p>When you add it all up, building a custom CI setup makes a lot of sense. And I&#x27;m sure they grew it over time, with an initial version that was usable being completed in just a few months. What they&#x27;ve open sourced is the end result of spending that time.<p>When you really adopt testing as part of your culture, CI becomes totally critical so engineering should spend the time to make it a solid and viable solution.",1378495037

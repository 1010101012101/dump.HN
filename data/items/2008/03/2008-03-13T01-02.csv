You can also use the google for talks by top execs, esp to analysts (esp. wall st.).  That's a great quick way to get a sense of how they think about their different markets.
You're giving yourself a huge mountain to climb of research.  Can you focus on a subset of issues?  Note that customer info can be simplifying - if people are convinced something has poor performance, then that defines the market reality.",1205370313

135638,comment,135166,135449,0,0,tx,,,"I can see why you're saying what you're saying, but I didn't find debugging particularly hard, and binary size explosion is probably your particular compiler's problem: MSVC 7.1 works very nice with templates, generating code only when absolutely needed, and sharing generated method/function instances across multiple template instantiations when types allow.<p>Moreover, STL is beautiful. It was originally designed for Smalltalk if I remember correctly, and it's ""ugliness"" is nothing more than a bad implementation. Separating alogrithms away from the data types they operate on is a novel idea. Granted, you get it for free in dynamic languages, but STL goes as far as you can get in a rigid world of stone types.<p>I have been facsinated by C++, by its ugliness, its sheer size, hidden powers and fast code it generates. My interest in it has faded away as CPUs got faster.<p>In my opinion the biggest issue with C++ is the lack of any kind of modules, and the author of the original post correctly recognizes that. Those endless includes multiplied by need for templates, produce ridiculous build times and make it impossible to hide implementation details (everythin g is still exposed via hpp-files).",1205370154

The secret is its 'scaffolding,' which provides all the basic Web functionality most sites will ever need.

98615,comment,98360,98597,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I wasn't actually referring to the usual Python idioms, but if you're unfamiliar with Zope/Plone, you can be forgiven for not knowing that.  The Zope developers (and to a lesser degree Plone) don't actually seem to like Python, and so they've reinvented many common language features and libraries.  Partly this is historical...the Python that Zope was originally written in didn't have most of those features or the standard library that exists today.  It's one of the problems of developing a large codebase in a language that is still in rapid flux and doesn't mind throwing out backward compatibility (my Perl code written before Zope existed still runs on modern Perl, while practically none of my Python code from 1.5 through 2.2 runs today unmodified).<p>But, regardless of the very sound reasons for it to be the way it is, it's a very intimidating codebase, and a really good case study in the ""reinvent everything"" mindset.  (It's quite powerful, and I've worked with several of the guys who built it, as I did contract work for Zope Corp for a few years, and I have the utmost respect for their talent and intellect.  They're some of the smartest developers I've ever met.  But it's not quite like anything else I've ever seen when it comes to having a learning cliff, even with some pre-existing Python knowledge.)",1200387003

I like abstractions, but while I am busy thinking about my abstractions, the PHP coder has already churned out another three no-brainer pages.",1200386803

98612,comment,98528,98573,0,0,Tichy,,,"Come on, that has to be bullshit. I sympathize with the new ""power languages"" hype, but it can't be that much of a factor. Even with C++, C# or Java, you spend most of the time thinking. You don't even type all that much, because of the IDE support...<p>Actually I recently thought about the ""dependency on IDE makes you miss out on cool languages argument"", and you could basically just turn it on it's head: rejecting IDEs makes you miss out on a lot of cool features, too.",1200386674

Basically, they created my wife.<p>(She's going to do whatever the real life equivalent of down-modding me is if she ever sees that.)",1200386638

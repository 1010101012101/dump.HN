Most companies just finished their migration from Windows XP to Windows 7 so were expecting to sit out upgrading to Windows 8. So plenty of time for Microsoft to right the enterprise side of things.<p>That said if they don't have a compelling solution for the enterprise when the time for upgrades does come then its probably game over for them. The smart move would be for them to separate the consumer and enterprise lines so that the rot in one doesn't take the other down. Sadly I think Balmer's hubris is going to prevent that from happening so I can't see a way out of the inevitable downward spiral unless he gets shown the door.",1357433875

[Full disclosure: I'm a co-founder].<p>The ""browse-and-message"" paradigm is fundamentally broken, not to mention a little dehumanizing (you're kind of shopping for people, which, let's face it, is pretty weird).<p>Our take is that the biggest problems with online dating are both the online part and the dating part --- it's hard to gauge chemistry online and it's cumbersome (and for women, potentially dangerous) to arrange a meeting. Meanwhile, labeling it as dating increases the pressure and the awkwardness for everyone.<p>Grouper Social Club sets up drinks between 2 groups of friends: 3 guys and 3 girls (or 3 guys, etc.).<p>There are no profiles or messages on our site. We match the groups together ourselves using Facebook info (which overcomes a lot of biases), then take care of all the coordination. Members pre-pay for their drink and the experience (the only fee), confirm a time, then we give them the place to meet.<p>We don't like labels, and don't think of Groupers as dates. To some they're similar, but the expectations are importantly different. Worst case: you're out with your friends and experience a funny story together, the average case is a super fun night out where there are some sparks between at least a pair of you, and the best case is, well, sky's the limit. Also, there's safety (and less awkwardness and more variety) in numbers.<p>We're live in 13 major cities in the US and Canada and growing quickly. 93% of members who go on a Grouper say they want to go on another one, and about half already have.<p>Our mission isn't to fix online dating, it's to end loneliness. Specifically, we want to help people get out from behind the blue glow of their computer screens and actually connect with people.<p>Social networks and online dating sites can be more isolating than social. But they don't have to be.<p>Shoot me an email at Michael [at] joingrouper.com if you have any questions.",1357433843

There's a market opportunity - money has traditionally been made from dating/introduction services. They seem very suitable to move online. And they would seem to scale: in most services people match themselves, or an algorithm matches them, without involvement from the site staff. You would also expect network effects to be strong (customers want access to all the candidates in their geographical location) therefore rapid growth and huge revenue seems a possibility in a winner takes all kind of way.<p>So tell me: why has the online dating market not been locked up (pace occasional disruption) since 1999? My suspicion is the existing sites just don't have any way to differentiate themselves from the competition that actually makes a difference.<p>Online dating, if it can be 'fixed', will be fixed when someone has an insight into the underlying social question and manages to implement something unique.",1357433626
5014761,comment,5013518,5014709,3,0,corporalagumbo,,,"Hmm.<p>1) I'm not sure that I agree with you that touch and keyboard/mouse don't mix. Perhaps nobody's come up with a good mix yet. At the very least, what is to stop us from writing software that recognises when input modes change and shifts to suit the new mode? We can write responsive websites that shift to fit different screen sizes.<p>2) Maybe you can't operate W8 from a keyboard, but you can operate it a hell of a lot better than iOS. At least Microsoft tried to make something that works with both. In Metro you can select tiles with the keyboard arrow keys, search with the Windows key, go to desktop, switch apps, all with keyboard shortcuts.<p>3) Perhaps the paradigms seem unreal and disparate at the moment, but is that any reason to give up on a future where interfaces are fluid, responsive and seamless across multiple devices and input modes?<p>4) I agree with you that it is easier to position a pointing device with a trackpad. But that's the whole point of a touchscreen - you don't need to position a pointing device. Rewrite the apps to make them larger and finger-friendly, and forget pointing devices. If you want total accuracy just plug in a mouse. You can do it with the Surface, so what's the problem?<p>5) I have a Lumia 800 too, and I quite like it. I don't think it's good enough for Microsoft to become a real competitor to Android and iPhone, but I definitely don't think it's crap. Anyway, it doesn't mix interfaces at all - Metro on Windows Phone is touch only. So, why don't you like it?",1357433602

5014732,comment,5013518,5013518,8,0,corporalagumbo,,,"I think Thurott is asking the wrong questions here. He says that Windows machines are too expensive - that Microsoft needs to retreat from its tactic of seeking a higher ASP. But the elephant is the room is clear - Apple manages to sell truckloads of laptops with a far higher ASP - and with no touchscreens to boot. Why are people willing to splash out for an Apple machine, but not for Windows? I think the answer is clearly prestige. For people like us, when we choose a new computer, we tend to buy sausage over sizzle (which is not to say that the allure of sizzle isn't lost on us.) So we're willing to spend fairly large sums of money on either Apple or Windows machines, whichever lets us do what we want to do best. We're educated, we're willing to research and understand the relative advantages and disadvantages of different OSes, different laptops, custom-built desktops, different components, etc.<p>Naturally the vast majority of consumers are nothing like us. They know little to nothing about computers, and because there are so many options out there in computers, they feel extremely anxious because they have no idea how to choose one. As a result, they buy sizzle, because sizzle makes them feel less anxious about buying something. Who has the best sizzle? Apple. Are Apple products really the best? Doesn't matter - Apple makes their customers feel safe spending money. If you hear non-tech literate people talking about computers, who are they talking about nine times out of ten? Apple. Or maybe Android. Windows? No. Touchscreen laptops? No. Not even the best new W8 models - eg. the Yoga. They're there in the shops, the ads are on tv, but no normal people are talking about them. They're all busy talking about the iPhone 5, or the iPad.<p>Microsoft's selling strategy - a rough-around-the-edges OS sold on hundreds of different OEM machines, 95% of which are pretty crappy for all sorts of different reasons - bad build quality, shitty trackpads, rubbish battery life, bloatware, poor customer support - has ruined their reputation among consumers. The stain of generic, confusing, quality-agnostic OEMs has polluted their brand. All the time Microsoft was busy selling whatever crap people would buy, Apple was selling only a handful of carefully-chosen products. Apple sold less in the short term, but their restraint is paying off massively now, because they never polluted their brand. They still have a brand they can sell. Microsoft doesn't, except for Office maybe.<p>The neat thing about how Apple's strategy works is that their lower-priced products don't compete with the rest of their range. Consumers don't buy iPod Touches instead of iPads, or iPads instead of Macbooks. Kids buy iPod Touches, which is as much as they can afford, and then their iPod Touch makes them aspire to buy an iPad. Then they buy an iPad when they can afford it, and again they aspire to a Macbook. Apple protects its high-end products well. Importantly, at every stage, at every income point, consumers are willing to prioritise buying an Apple product. Even iTunes and the App Store help Apple skim the cream off consumer's disposable income. It's a great system, with desirable, non-competitive products at every price point.<p>All the while computer stores are filled with masses of generic Windows boxes, competing against and drowning out some of the better, less-generic models - and nobody really cares. Microsoft has rushed right into its next-generation OS, launching it on as many different PC models as possible, trying to accelerate its app ecosystem to life as quickly as possible. I personally think Microsoft should have taken it slower, though maybe things will improve over time - Microsoft has a knack for persistence. I can however see Microsoft trying to do too much too soon, missing the opportunity for a real refresh, perpetuating the same problem of appearing try-hard and incoherent to consumers, tainting it app store with prolonged early irrelevance, failing to create a splash which a next-gen OS could have made, and giving Apple plenty of opportunity to watch and learn.<p>Thurott's advice is to drive for even-lower prices - polluting an already tainted brand even further. I would argue the opposite is necessary. Microsoft needs to cut the cruft, somehow, take its time, dial back its strident ""look how great we are!"" marketing, and develop some real, quiet, unforced confidence. If you're quiet and confident, and its clear you respect yourself, you don't need to run around trying to get people's attention. People will pay attention to you, given time. Patience pays off. That's the lesson of Apple I think.<p>That's why I think Ballmer is not a great CEO. He never quits yelling about how great Windows is, how everything is fine in Microsoft land. There's no humility.",1357433004

The product manager makes the call: cut IE support so that the Webkit version can launch on time.  A redirect's put in place to avoid serving a completely broken experience to Windows 8 users, so they can at least do a search for businesses instead of having it not work.<p>They launch, the press picks it up, and conspiracy theories start flying.  Somebody pages the team, emails start flying, there's a huddle to figure out how to fix it.  An engineer (or a few engineers) ""donate"" their weekend to fixing IE compatibility.  They work day and night until the bugs are fixed, and then remove the redirect.<p>PR makes a statement, and then another one once the problem can be fixed.  Like all PR statements, they try to say the minimum amount possible to calm people down, since everything they do say will get picked apart by the press.  They aren't engineers, they know only what the engineers tell them, and they say even less because whatever the engineers say will get wildly distorted as it passes from engineer -> PM -> PR -> press -> Hacker News.<p>Just my humble conjecture, as an engineer who's been in this situation several times before at a few different organizations (both Google and otherwise).  I'd think critically before reaching for pitchforks, though.",1357432973

In the short term, if you're setting up a company that is building revenue generating sites, you can probably capture more than that in revenue if you're paying people to do the work. The accounting gets a bit fuzzy because we're talking about two classes of entities here (one in which labor expenses come out of net revenue, and the other in which they come out of gross revenue). Another trade-off is liability, who pays out if one of these projects gets sued; are they individually severable from the parent entity? If not, then setting up the system is unappealing compared to a traditional employment relationship. And if they are that raises the cost-complexity of the setup since you need to manage the transaction costs of setting up new entities as well as the ongoing overhead of managing the accounting for each of the formed entities.<p>Basically what you're talking about is a setup that would allow web workers to earn residual income for their efforts as opposed to the present system where the route to residuals goes through ownership of the company.

I think interviewing is broken but I really don't know the answer how to fix it so I have to just ""play the game"".  I'm pretty good at ""playing the game"" but I am feeling the same level of interview burnout while looking for work as interviewers do looking for candidates and I can't help but think it hurts the industry overall as engineers don't look for new jobs just to avoid the hazing process of interviewing.<p>Without trying to sound like I'm bragging, I consider myself a senior level, talented engineer.  Recently, however, the startup I have been working at ran out of funds and I have been pounding the pavement looking for work.  The problem is that I don't feel like any interview I have been doing, or for that matter, have ever done, is really a measure of how good I am as an engineer.  It's more a stamina test to see how well I can be tortured and hazed and it makes me reluctant to take on more interviews.  Most interviews are about being quizzed on the minutae of a language or about solving a programming quiz in 60 seconds while the interviewer critiques thought of every line.  I just don't see how these interviews are actually filtering out bad candidates or measuring good candidates.  They are measuring how someone performs in a very specific, non-realistic situation that does not emulate how every day work would occur.  The worst example of this are the horrible SHL/Brainbench tests that seem to measure memorization more than skill.  I do quite well on those silly tests, but I'm not sure they really measured anything accurately.<p>I was the happiest when I got homework assignments as my tech prescreen  or was asked to walk through examples of my own code with their engineering team.  I feel these are less stress on the interviewee because it is code you are familiar with and are a closer exemplar of what goes every day at work.<p>Or maybe I'm just a wimp.",1357431334

None of my friends would even consider reading the Hobbit or LoTR, but they've all seen and enjoyed the movies. (A tiny minority even tried reading the book). Now, its something that we enjoy talking about over many afternoons",1357430918

But thats not the way to treat <i>people</i>. Clients are human beings, they want to be taken care of and understood. Some of them are easier to understand than others, but at the end of the day, everybody wants the same thing. They just want to find someone who will listen, take them seriously, and be there when shit hits the fan. I always keep in touch with clients, and make an effort to send them business. For example, I did a project for a startup who has a great product. From one of my ads on HN, I got contacted to do some engineering work. But hey, my client's product can do what this other person needs at a fraction of the cost. So I advised the person inquiring and got him in touch with the client. They were able to agree on terms. My client made a huge sale. The prospect saved thousands of dollars. And I was able to expand my network with another happy person.",1357430652

5014588,comment,5014392,5014517,42,0,magicalist,,,"Christopher Tolkien can be called many things. He hasn't always done the best job stewarding his father's world, erring on the side of conservatism and disapproving of anyone else's work based on his father's (rightly or wrongly). And he's kind of a jerk.<p>But the Brian Herbert comparison just means you've never read anything Christopher Tolkien actually published (or you never attempted to read Brian Herbert's terrible terrible work). The <i>only</i> publication where Christopher Tolkien embellished or added to his father's writings was The Silmarillion, published under pressure from their publisher to get it out the door as soon as possible after his father's death and when he was younger (relatively) and less sure about his bargaining position to leave his father's work untouched. The added narrative was mostly connecting prose, meant to keep the story more coherent, and one full chapter replacing a version that was hopelessly out of date compared to the rest of the updates his father had added over decades. He's repeatedly expressed regret about changing The Silmarillion (including again in this article), and has even laid out exactly what he added to the story so you can mentally edit it out.<p>Every single other book (that would be 13 of them, I believe) that he's published has been literally a written guide to trying to piece together a chronological view of all the undated scraps of rough drafts and notes his father left behind. The only thing he adds are clearly delimited notes about why he thinks some scrap came next and summaries about how some minor change made elsewhere suddenly made ripples of changes through future drafts of other sections, which he then proceeds to include verbatim.<p>In other words, there's no way to get <i>less</i> respectful of his father's work, short of leaving it unpublished. Again, he can be called many things (he really does seem to be like a total jerk, and there's no way <i>any</i> adaptation would have pleased him, even a word-for-word dramatic reading), but comparing him to Brian Herbert and what he did with Dune is beyond the pale.<p>Yes, Brian Herbert's work is just that bad :)",1357430487

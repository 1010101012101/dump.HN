Its only offering that could it semi-accurately call PaaS, Cloud Sites, is lacking - it supports few runtimes, without things like git-based deployment that would enable it to fit into a CI Pipeline, and it seems intended to host static websites with some dynamic features rather than full-fledged web applications.<p>I think they are also failing by trying to differentiate themselves in a business that will end up being much like a utility. When your business acts like a utility it&#x27;s kind of a race to the bottom on prices. Furthermore, in attempting to differentiate themselves, they failed to characterize their primary customer properly - the kind of person who interacts with RackSpace directly is not the kind of person who calls support a whole lot, and yet the quality of their managed support seems to be their sole differentiating factor. My company did take advantage of managed support a few times, and when we did so it was enormously helpful, but it wasn&#x27;t enough to keep us there when we saw lower-cost offerings elsewhere, because we have enough expertise in-house to solve 99% of problems that come our way.<p>That said, I own RAX and I would very much like to see the stock stop tanking. An acquisition proposition could send the price back up to near where I bought it - and who knows? Maybe I&#x27;ll end up trading it in for some more AMZN ( a stock that has also been tanking, by the way.)",1400212217

[1] quotes some summary text from wikipedia and provides a few links.<p>Having grown up in the Arctic, with polar night in winter, and polar day in summer, I&#x27;ve always been somewhat sceptical that we supposedly can&#x27;t adapt to different cycles than what is common further south. But even if I frequently shift my days by having an extended cycle, and compared to many of my friends function longer and better on less sleep, if I am <i>active</i> I usually get quite tired after about 20 hours. If I do stay awake through that period, I can hit 36 or even 48 hours without making much of an effort -- but I have a hard time believing that that would be a &quot;natural&quot; cycle (36+12) for me -- or most people.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re forced to be physically passive, and given some other stimuli, be that books, computer games -- what have you -- I could perhaps see a longer cycle as &quot;normal&quot;.<p>For a different (animal) aspect, see [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/info/cycle_length.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.circadiansleepdisorders.org/info/cycle_length.php</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226667"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20226667</a>",1400211381

Over time, a well-trained elephant develops an understanding that the habit of dental care is beneficial and rewarding, and teaches other elephants to do the same.<p>Thus, we might conclude that all tooth brushing elephants are sentient, self-aware beings.<p>This would mean that some of the possible pre-requisites for intelligent life are now either eyes <i>OR</i> teeth...<p>Now, to extend beyond elephants, we&#x27;d need to find another behavior, trait or defining aspect that elephants can share with another species that humans cannot. Thus if elephants must be the bridge-species to self-aware-intellect without natural eyes, they must carry three intelligence defining attributes.<p><pre><code>  1. Eyes, to relate to humans, enabling primary confirmation\n\n  2. Teeth, as a shared attribute, for secondary confirmation, especially in elephants stricken blind by randomized misfortune\n\n  3. Other: something that does not relate to humans, but can confirm intellect\n</code></pre>\nSo, sticking with elephants, let&#x27;s say elephants have a prehensile tentacle like organ, in that they can grasp and articulate objects with their trunk.<p>This means that elephants can see themselves in the mirror, so humans can know that elephants are fellows in individualized personal experience.<p>A sighted elephant might manage to teach a blind elephant to brush it&#x27;s own teeth, thus, elephants that fail the mirror test can still be confirmed as intelligent, if they can carry the capacity to brush their own teeth.<p>Elephants can be encouraged to brush their own teeth, and hypothetically devise opportunities to teach other creatures to do the same, if they recognize that the other creatures have teeth, but no eyes. Emphasis on the <i>HYPOTHETICALLY</i>, since this is a thought experiment.<p>Elephants, furthermore, can reach beyond the normal capacity for humans to recognize intelligence, in that they can operate their trunks in a manner that confirms intelligence in other creatures with trunk-like appendages, such as ant-eaters, snakes, octopuses, squids, worms and even certain, very long slugs.<p>Now, given that elephants act as the bridge species to these other creatures, could we extend beyond elephants, and use elephants to confirm intellect in these other creatures that can confirm intellect in creatures humans and elephants, otherwise, cannot?<p>Does this hold hypothetical water? Possibly, but man, does it ever feel like a long shot. It&#x27;s like the Monty Python test for a witch.<p>How about insects? For example, what if we start with bees as a likely candidate? How do we confirm self-awareness in bees? Could we extend this logic from bees, and beyond, over to another type of insect, through a recognition of mutual traits shared with bees?",1400211373

7753520,comment,7750099,7753251,2,0,brudgers,,,"PG isn&#x27;t warning any experienced Common Lisp programmer about `nconc`. The [n] at the front means it&#x27;s destructive...there&#x27;s also `nsubst` and `nreverse` and `nstring-capitalize`. They all exist in Common Lisp to allow a programmer to avoid consing and the subsequent garbage collection. In other words, they exist to allow a programmer to optimize their code. They exist as exceptions to idiomatic Common Lisp practice of returning values in lieu of mutating locations.  Sure it is not as idiomatic in Common Lisp as in Clojure in part because Common Lisp is largely a product of its time and that time was largely single threaded.<p>Avoiding mutation in Common Lisp is even less idiomatic than it is in Scheme - where there are not destructive versions of various functions by default and idiomatic practice is mutation is signaled with a bang [!]. But again, the preferred approach is persistence and writing side-effect free functions. Indeed at the front edge of Scheme, Racket implements immutable data structures by default.<p>Idiomatic functional style and defaulting to immutable data structures are not what makes Clojure unique as a Lisp - it&#x27;s knob twiddling, not a new paradigm. It has some great built in syntax that allows for the best part of Lisp-2 programming - i.e. symbols representing a collection acting as functions over the collection and the association of a meta-data map with a symbol like a plist. But it&#x27;s evolutionary as a Lisp.<p>On the other hand, though not unique, idiomatic functional style and defaulting to immutable data structures are unusual in relation to the Java platform. Its relationship to the Java platform is what makes Clojure unique. STM is not a product of it&#x27;s Lisp heritage. Neither is it&#x27;s implementation of objects with via interop [largely eschewing objects despite availability is also idiomatic Lisp].<p>Understand, I&#x27;m writing to think. What you&#x27;ve written is just a starting point I can use as an excuse for saying what I was primed to say anyway. Like I said in my original comment, I was already drinking from the Clojure firehose.<p>So what&#x27;s the upshot? Well what did your article say that hasn&#x27;t already been said before about functional programming? Why not point people to Chapter 3 of Graham? It&#x27;s more convincing for those who need convincing and more in depth for those who don&#x27;t. Why not point people to <i>The Value of Values</i>, it&#x27;s again more convincing for tire-kickers; a comfortable sermon for the newly converted, and a reference point  for those already in the cult.<p>What really makes Clojure unique?",1400209947

But yes, they were (and remain) separate projects, with Patrick at that time being the point person for Rakudo, not Parrot, and others being point people for Parrot, not Rakudo.<p>> {the teams running Rakudo and Parrot} had a limited understanding of each others&#x27; perspective<p>Perhaps.<p>My own understanding (which is admittedly also merely armchair analysis after the fact for most of the period 2006 thru mid 2011) goes something like this.<p>First, the gap between Rakudo&#x27;s purpose and Parrot&#x27;s purpose became (or maybe was from the get go) an irreconcilable conflict.<p>(Rakudo&#x27;s purpose is to ship a practical P6 compiler, including a multi backend strategy to address Larry&#x27;s &quot;must target VMs&quot; requirement. Parrot&#x27;s purpose is to ship a practical VM for dynamic languages, with P6/Rakudo given no special status.)<p>Probably the last chance to have gotten things back on track, which I define as Parrot trying to serve P6&#x27;s and hence Rakudo&#x27;s needs, even if it did other things, was 2010. Patrick was made a member of the Parrot Foundation&#x27;s small board in 2009. Rakudo Star was coming. jnthn had designed and implemented 6model and NQP and there was a chance Patrick could have convinced Parroteers to replace the broken stuff in Parrot with these pieces.<p>But then, just as Patrick needed to be most available to steer Rakudo (and perhaps to steer Parrot too) through the very difficult year 2010 (to produce, ship and support an initial Rakudo Star; to evolve Rakudo in the face of the problems of fit with Parrot; to try keep Parrot viable), he suddenly had to drastically lessen his involvement -- falling to near zero in late 2011 and since.<p>(NB. Please don&#x27;t say this was Patrick exhibiting the &quot;leave phase&quot; syndrome you talked about.)<p>At this point, instead of the previous situation in which the conflicting directions were more implicit than explicit, it now became clear Rakudo and Parrot were going to do their own things. They might both survive and work with each other. They might not.<p>In early 2011, commits to the master branch of the Parrot repo fell of a cliff.<p>By 2012 it really looked bad for Parrot, judging by the paucity of commits and #parrot (in)activity.<p>In spring 2012 jnthn secretly started MoarVM. He reasoned that if by some miracle Parrot got back on track in a way  that obviated the need for MoarVM he could mothball it or transfer the best pieces. If not, he&#x27;d charge right on ahead and finish MoarVM.<p>Fast forward to 2014. Reini Urban is about the only person working on Parrot and it is currently falling further behind in supporting Rakudo&#x27;s current needs. For example, concurrency. In contrast MoarVM now far outperforms Parrot as a backend for NQP and Rakudo and looks set to pull much further ahead this year.",1400209492

226079,comment,225858,225858,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I like this.<p>Like everything else, though, the trick is finding the sweet spot in the market where you can make a buck and provide value to other people.<p>Who is it worth money to, in order to read your mag? Is it people who are offline -- the internet illiterate? Seems like it would be people looking for good content and not using one of the aggregation engines/sites out there. I'm just guessing, but perhaps that is a pretty tight niche. Something like older people interested in penguin farming but who don't own a computer.<p>If you can identify/find this niche, then I think you're halfway there. But the idea is only ""cool"" because in the back of my mind I think there IS such a niche. Beats me what it is, though.<p>Be aware that your niche may not be readers. It could be magazine providers. For instance, doctor's offices provide magazines for people to read while they wait. There might be a nice niche in there where you could provide content based on the doctor's type of practice and clientele. I'm sure you could identify, for instance, 40,000 foot doctors in the United States. Maybe 20% of them (I know, Chinese Math, but this is back-of-napkin-stuff) would be interested in providing internet ""recap"" material for those waiting in their office. Eight thousand docs at $40 a year, and you've got a nice niche business for yourself and maybe a couple other people.",1214306403

226074,comment,225564,225564,0,0,hooande,,,"I don't know if this idea is going to work out or not. One of the reasons that YCombinator works is that web based startups  generally need very little initial investment. You can build a social website for well under $5,000/person for three months. Generally these world changing, end all hunger type ideas take a lot more to get going than that. It certainly seems like it's going to take a very large amount of capital and connections to make it actually work.",1214305867
226073,comment,225858,225858,0,0,greyman,,,"Your idea is interesting and might work. One Slovakian daily does something similar - they have blogs written by their readers (anyone can register one), and if they find some blog post interesting, they republish it in print (but they have an agreement with blog writers that they can do that - as a counter-service for free hosting).<p>The potential problems of your idea to think about:<p>1) Many blog posts are written in a conversational style, and their purpose is to collect relevant links, comment on something, or spark a discussion. Basically, many blogs can be characterized as conversation platforms - reprinting them to paper will lose this dimension.<p>2) For reprinting you would need to pick up essay-like blog posts, which have their own merit without reader comments or inbound links. And those are not easy to find, so you can encounter similar issue like ""normal"" magazines - how to find good content.<p>3) When we are really talking about magazine (not newspaper), the important parts are also design and photos. You will really need (to pay for) professional photos to make the magazine engaging.<p>4) distribution - another big pain in the... how will you distribute?<p>To sum it up, if I would like to make money from blogs, I would rather go to a path of either:<p>1) republishing the blogs online (might have sense if you add value by grouping interesting stuff together)<p>2) trying to run blog network myself and share revenue with authors<p>3) start a blog myself and pay writers per post (or per visitor numbers).",1214305804

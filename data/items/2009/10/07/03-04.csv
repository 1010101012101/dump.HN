Rather than panic, though, there are simple ways to avoid becoming a victim or being further victimized, if your account has already been compromised.",1254887888

Vonage was really unreliable, but the Ringcentral hosted service has been great.<p>I'll add a couple pros:<p>* no noticable downtime in over a year<p>* iPhone app (visual voicemail, call out from the app as if you were sitting at your desk, preview faxes, etc)<p>* you can have various voicemail or auto-attendant messages for different times - after hours, holidays, etc<p>* 800-number usage counts as normal minutes - not an upcharge<p>* easy fax usage - incoming/outgoing<p>Cons:<p>* Customer support is outsourced so they do the standard process of running through a checklist of questions. (However, I have only needed to call twice and they did answer my question one time. The second time I figured it out before they responded via email.)",1254887887

I think I was just thinking a little too much about myself because I felt jailed in by education.<p>But on the other hand even though we force those kids to learn algebra who might not have learned it if it was up to them, how much do they really understand of it when they are initially taught? Do they only truly learn it when they rediscover it later on in life (perhaps at a more natural moment when it becomes practical) only to have the educational system take credit?<p>I mean even in college some of my friends take the attitude of <i>pass now</i> and learn the stuff for real when they get their jobs later in life.<p>I'm thinking we could improve efficiency by somehow bypassing the <i>pass now</i> stage. Of course it's much more complicated to do that than it seems.<p>Instead of focusing on cramming info to give the illusion of education, we could teach children why they should learn, and try to get them interested and self motivated.",1254887868

866000,comment,865713,865713,0,0,carbocation,,,"I made this point on the NYT website but it hasn't shown up yet, so I'll make it again here.<p>What is the problem that these startups are trying to solve? It is explained in the last paragraph: \nStill, Mr. Kibbe said, 'part of the problem with the health care system is physicians only have a small amount of time to see patients face-to-face,' and these new tools increase their interaction.<p>Very clearly, they claim they are trying to fix the fact that physicians only have a small amount of time to see each patient face-to-face.<p>But that is a problem that patients, not doctors, face. Specifically, patients spend lots of time waiting around for their chance to speak with a doctor. This is because a doctor's time is (seen as) so valuable that people are willing to wait. Basically, time with a doctor is a scarce resource.<p>Now, take a look at this from the doctor's perspective. Clinicians have optimized schedules. When they are seeing patients, they blaze through many per hour. Time is almost always being used efficiently, because there are several patients waiting for the doctor.<p>So, this brings us back to the main problem that I have with these startups: they claim that they are trying to increase the amount of time that physicians and patients can spend face-to-face. What they are really doing is cutting down on the amount of time that patients have to waste while waiting for their doctor. Sure, this is a problem for patients, but it is not a problem for doctors - and it is certainly not one of the critical problems in the health care system today that we must resolve now. This does nothing to give doctors more time to see more patients, because most doctors are already using their time fairly optimally (with the exception of having to fill out insurance paperwork, which is not related to any of the issues addressed by these startups anyways).",1254887122

The whole point of transparency is so that we can see those cases where it wasn't automatic and where it wasn't justified.

865981,comment,865836,865919,0,0,pospischil,,,"You have nailed it...<p>When apple introduced the iPhone, it became a big to-do because it was 10x better (at least?) than anything else on the market.  ""Me-too-ing"" the iPhone (palm?) (android in another year) isn't going to get you there.  The trouble is, Apple had a lot of opportunity -- 3.5 years ago, if you looked at a cell phone, it was absolutely clear that a LOT of things needed to be done.  Apple simply executed on those things, but did so in an absolutely stunning way -- it just worked.  And it worked in a way that most of us didn't realize was possible.<p>The second idea -- that a low cost version can work, I think is valid.  But then, is that the chunk of the market that you want?  To be another dell, making $4 per unit?  Do carriers even want the smart phone that doesn't come with the data contract?<p>As for openness, as the other commenters have pointed out, most people don't care.  If something ends up happening that causes people to actually care about the openness (or lack there of), than Android will be well positioned.

It's complete ignorance on the author's part to suggest that Rails and Hibernate serialize objects into a single cell. acts_as_nested_set even provides a decent way of dealing with tree structured data in a relational store.<p>His second part is off base as well, the challenges of serialization in strongly typed languages have little to do with wire protocols.  He seems to be suggesting that adding a translation layer would solve the problem. It rather seems that would still fail if deserialization were used, as the translation layer would then become brittle.  Rather it would seem to be more wise to step away from a serialization based persistence approach, while it might be a good idea for wire protocols, since the data is more ephemeral.",1254885545

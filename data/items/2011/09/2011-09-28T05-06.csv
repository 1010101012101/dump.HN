They last a year or two, which is a bit longer than the bulbs they replace, but not much. There's no place to dispose of them safely though so they are just stacking up in boxes for now. I found with the warranties that you have to ship the bulbs back at your own expense to an address, which because of the weight of the ceramic base costs more than the bulb did originally. This means in practice they don't really have a warranty, so you did the right thing throwing the warranty packaging out.",1317189515

I understand that a lot of people may have bought TextMate because they were told the update to 2.0 would be free (otherwise they may have waited). However, with as big as TextMate is and how a guy with little or no team was able to create it, he can't possibly afford to offer it to free for the thousands of people who bought the original one.<p>I think it would be perfectly fair to offer a discounted price to those who bought TextMate 1.0 (as opposed to free).  That's a pretty fair thing to do IMHO. Many others said it, but if you are shelling out all the big bucks to buy a Mac, spending a few more bucks on an outstanding piece of software. It is a good way to show your support to the developer and make him continue sending out updates.<p>Just imagine the scenario where he does offer it for free, makes virtually no profit, and then ends up quitting support for TextMate 2 (as in making bug fixes, features, etc) because he can't afford to just live off of doing that. We all lose in that scenario.<p>I'm a student with lots of debt, but I will buy TextMate 2 full price because it's a good investment. Even if he does offer it for free, it would be a great gesture to buy it anyway or at least open up a donation thing for him.<p>Can't wait for its release!",1317189108

So they are investing in the same way that Chase invests in credit card debt by offering people credit cards, or that GM finance invests in cars by offering auto loans.<p>The claim that the monthly loan payments will be ""often less than paying for energy from the grid"" is certainly false and I'd be willing to bet money that it will not be established that people are generating solar energy for less than the cost of buying it off the grid.<p>Finally, if one was really interested in green technology, either installing a roof top solar hot water heater and/or a geothermal heat pump will save more energy than a rooftop residential PV installation will generate, but at a much lower cost.",1317188265

There are many apps like this on the App Store already, but the purpose I create this app is because of another project.<p>A year ago, I was working on my graduation project as a undergraduate major in CS / embedded system. My project is to simulate a virtual device driver on Linux and Windows platform to share devices (especially HID devices like mouse, keyboard, gamepad..) between computers.<p>It turned out that I can create a virtual device that act as either mouse or gamepad (full functional gamepad, not just up/down arrow on keyboard). Therefore I decided to create an mobile app that help people to control computers via Wi-Fi.<p>Unlike most other remote control apps on App Store, which only simulate keyboard/mouse signal, and fake to be a gamepad/joystick, Air Controller is detected on Windows as a USB game controller, which means you can connect more than one iDevices to the same computer and the control signal is more precise (especially in Steering Wheel mode).<p>Id love to hear your feedbacks and thoughts on this app. Anyone here major in Human-Computer Interaction, what else can I do to make this app more interactive, more fun ?",1317188226

I/O (assuming that's what you mean by write) is not even relevant. What matters the most is _memory_, and more importantly, _infinite, easily accessible_ memory. Nondeterministic finite automata have only finite amount of memory available, and thus they are very constrained on what they can compute. Nondeterministic pushdown automata, in spite of having infinite amount of memory available, don't have an easy access to it, and so, being stronger than finite automata, they're still weaker than Turing machines. But as soon as you add a second stack to a pushdown automaton, it suddenly becomes Turing complete. Hell, you can do it even with 6 integer variables instead of 2 stacks (I recall from my computation theory course that 3 integer variables are enough to encode a stack, so 6 will give you two stacks. Maybe you can go down even to 5 or 4). However, you absolutely require infinite memory, because, for sane definitions of ""memory"", every device with finite amount of memory (for instance, x86 PC) will not be able to compute anything more than deterministic finite automaton. From this point of view, all our computers are able to do is to match its input to a long and hairy regular expression.

And then release another build to fix that new feature.<p>It takes at most an hour for a new build to go live on the Market, and all of that is propagation delay. Updates on iOS take a week to go live, and that's if Apple likes you. And you haven't accidentally used pinch zoom in a way that they consider to be proprietary.<p>People I know who have released on iOS and Android tell me they often are 4-5 builds ahead on Android, and that they hate their iOS version because it has so many bugs that Apple hasn't approved the fixes for yet. I'm frankly surprised that a start-up would release first on iOS, given the standard ""release early and often"" philosophy around here.<p>Whatever. Good luck. If I see an announcement for the Android version, I may give it a try. I'm a bootstrapped indie developer myself, so I can sympathize with your position. But my game has been polished under the Android fan base as a first release, and only in the next month will get a full release on iOS.",1317186725

A brand like Google can get to so many more users than a startup can. I'm amazed quite often by the number of people who don't know what Dropbox is. Yet, when Google enters this market, it'll be those people discovering GDrive and thinking ""This is awesome! Why haven't I seen this before!"" Competition drives innovation, definitely. Question is, who can innovate quicker and expand their market more rapidly, a startup or Google. Google has resources a startup does not. And for that, Google can often get to a controlling stake in the market, thereby controlling the innovation and halting that of the original business.",1317186662

Thank you.<p>It was a bit difficult to network, however. As other posters have pointed out, there were so many attendees and since there were no indicative markings on the badges, it was impossible to distinguish between a potential ""match"" and a friendly (but potentially unproductive) conversation. But hey, hindsight is 20/20. Looking forward to next time.<p>As you mentioned in your talk, you're unlikely to run into Sean Parker while strolling down 5th Avenue. NYC-area Meetups are enjoyable, as are, at times, General Assembly and other NYC institutions. But as you joked about on stage, they are not a substitute for the daily serendipity and access to talent that Silicon Valley has to offer. This is one of the Valley's greatest strategic advantages. That being said, there is a tremendous talent pool in NYC and last night helped reaffirm this fact. Over the course of my two entrepreneurial decades in this great city, I have never seen a NYC startup event attract such a targeted, valuable and eager audience. It's very possible that the YC brand-name was responsible for this feat. Would YC have any interest in sponsoring a regular NYC networking event? In addition to increasing YC-startup visibility and access to local talent, this could serve as a great boon for the NYC startup community.",1317186193

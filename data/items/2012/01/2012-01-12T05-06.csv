3455182,comment,3451934,3453254,1,0,Natsu,,,"The information about how old a person looks exists in the image itself.  You can compare the size and proportions of a person's features to known examples.  No one is going to mistake a four-year-old for a grandmother.  The information about whether or not someone has permission to copy something does <i>not</i> exist in the file:  the infringing copy and the legitimate copy are bit-for-bit identical.  You have to get the data on who has permission to do what from somewhere else.  The Viacom v. YouTube case proved that even expensive lawyers spending hours doing research can't manage to get even 99% accuracy.  They had to remove things that Viacom itself had uploaded (or authorized to be uploaded) from that case.  Twice.<p>Now suppose we have a magic system that's better than expensive copyright lawyers that can manage 99% accuracy (which they didn't) and that we operate at internet scale on the roughly 60 billion web pages Google indexes.  Then assume that no less than 20% of the internet is pirated material.  Does that sound too high?  Good.  Your numbers will look even <i>worse</i> if it's lower.  Now we do a little math:<p><pre><code>  0.2 * 0.99 = 19.8% are pirate pages correctly blocked\n  0.8 * 0.99 = 79.2% are innocent pages correctly allowed\n  0.2 * 0.01 =  0.2% are pirate pages mistakenly allowed\n  0.8 * 0.01 =  0.8% are innocent pages mistakenly blocked\n</code></pre>\nSo we've just censored four innocent pages for every one containing pirated material and there would be 120,000,000 pirate pages (0.2% of 60 billion) out there that aren't blocked.  Feel free to work out the math, but if you want to say that 20% is too high a proportion, you'll have <i>even more</i> false positives, so even more innocent pages are censored for every pirate blocked.<p>And this assumes that we have something better than ~$300/hr copyright lawyers screening all 60 billion web pages.  Any computer program we make won't even be <i>this</i> good.",1326346727

3455180,comment,3449908,3454934,1,0,fooandbarify,,,"I readily concede that the situation is more nuanced than ""software patents are bad"". However, I think we are coming at it from two different perspectives. You seem to be suggesting that ideas are innately deserving of protection. I don't share that point of view.<p>For fear of beating a dead horse, let me put it this way: (should I be made King) I would do away with patents altogether if that didn't mean removing all incentive for innovation. For physical inventions, patents foster innovation by ensuring that the inventor will have time to bring their invention to market before a competitor. (I mean no snark at all, but I believe the previous sentence to be generally true whether you buy it or not.) For software, the market does a great job of fostering innovation and so I don't see the advantage of software patents (and that is obviously where our views differ). If a person or a corporation believe that a certain software method offers them a particular advantage, they will retain it as a trade secret regardless.",1326346610

That way they could have one os for phones/tablets/pc's/ect. They could use their market/repository as a way to force people to modify uis. Since all of the 3rd party apps are written in a version of silverlight(they haven't dropped this restriction yet right?) it should have few incompatibilities.",1326345559

Alternatively, you have a machine that makes perfect copies. Both work the same for this purpose.<p>Because you only focus on the per-unit cost. But even cars have fixed, one-time R&D costs that are distributed on each sold car <i>totally arbitrarily</i> just as the fixed costs for producing digital goods area distributed <i>totally arbitrarily</i> on each download/CD/whatever. The only difference is that digital goods have virtually <i>no</i> per unit-costs to go along with it. Still, in both cases, you need frameworks to reward creative/R&D work if you want it to happen (especially in a competitive way).<p>If you copy all music and all cars, then everybody has a car and music, but what is the incentive to produce better cars and new music later? <i>That</i> is the big picture.",1326345552

I agree with the conclusion: there is no one-size-fits-all rule for interoperability.<p>The way I see it, it's ultimately about tradeoffs. I can only imagine what things would be like today if web browsers implemented a strict parsing of HTML and refused to render invalid pages. One possibility is hindered adoption of HTML by the masses. Another is that two vendors would disagree about the HTML spec and cause pages to be browser-specific. (Turns out this happened anyway :-))<p>Is the HTML5 spec better in terms of interop and compatibility than the previous ones? <a href=""http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/15/HTML5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2010/02/15/HTML5</a>",1326345472

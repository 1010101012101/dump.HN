Hiring full-time in SF (SoMA), contract-to-hire preferred:
  * Backend Software Engineer (python)
  * Data Engineer
  * Data Scientist<p>We&#x27;re a seed funded startup - 3 former Googlers - and we&#x27;re tackling the messy world of business. Every day, people shake hands over million-dollar deals that can change the future of a company. From fundraising and acquisitions to partnerships, promotions and product placement, businesses get together and make new things happen. But there&#x27;s no platform for them; they typically overload sales-focused CRMs, or are stuck in the world of spreadsheets and email. We&#x27;re changing that.
It&#x27;s a fascinating data problem as we&#x27;re mapping out professional and company-to-company networks, trying to understand who does business with whom and why, feeling our way around the underlying graph that nobody&#x27;s explicitly mapped out before. From old school tie to the boardroom, why do people do business with each other? What are the trust and influence networks? What&#x27;s the equivalent of PageRank for investors? What does it mean when a VP moves from one company to another? How do I get my startup funded?
We&#x27;re trying to answer all these questions. We have an invite-only product already launched, we&#x27;re building a team-facing solution, and we&#x27;re expanding our data team to work on the platform that powers it all. Here&#x27;s our team&#x27;s take on the space: <a href=""https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567"" rel=""nofollow"">https://medium.com/@jennielees/the-joy-of-data-a1d3757d3567</a>
Looking for fast learners who can get their hands dirty, quickly; who know when to duct tape and when to have 100% test coverage (think like a hacker, ship like a pro); who don&#x27;t mind being wrong occasionally; and who are intrigued by the overall space we&#x27;re in. We&#x27;ve had a good run from HN posts so far, hoping to continue it.
You&#x27;d be single-digit employee and have a significant chance to influence our culture and growth, as well as immense impact on the product itself. We have a generous equity setup, though we prefer contract-to-hire so we can figure out if we&#x27;d work well together.
For our generalist role we&#x27;d prefer it if you have Rails experience; for our data roles, Python. Graph-specific data experience is a bonus.<p>Email falon@close.co",1418615837

Several of the allegedly first discoveries of America (Lief Erikson, Christopher Columbus, others) were content to arrive, take a brief look &#x27;round, and return home. Topping Mt. Everest involved little more than planting a flag and heading back down. Apollo, indeed, planted a pole - and even took time to drive around a little before heading back with a few rocks.<p>Early on, just getting there and coming back intact is hard enough. Get that process down first, then see what else can be done.<p>Methinks the real hindrance to further manned space exploration was: after great effort, we stood someone on a dead rock. Yeah, sorta interesting, but not really compelling; no really dramatic scenery, no minerals worth the cost of mining, too exhausting to think (after that huge effort) of the place of a jumping-off point for an orders-of-magnitude harder effort to go somewhere else not much more interesting when you actually get there.

While SV is part of the SF Bay Area, the 2 are pretty different places as far as tech job culture goes.<p>Some of his main points given in the article:<p>> To me, an office filled with bean bags and ‘zany’ things is a lot like someone who wears over-sized brightly colored glasses and a loud bow-tie everywhere. In other words, its a desperate attempt to compensate for the fact that you know you don’t have any creativity, and convey a tragic, almost pleading message to the outside world that convinces us otherwise.<p>Is such a general, sweeping projection really a good argument against a group? First, you have to look at the crowd these companies want to attract. A lot of companies in SV that I&#x27;ve worked with have employees around 25-30 years old. While having cubicles and grey walls may feel more professional to some people, others prefer a more comfortable environment that reminds them of a lounge or living room. It&#x27;s a sort of freedom of expression as well. Not everybody wants to be restricted to sitting down at a desk, to only get up for meetings and coffee. Freedom of movement, to walk around, to sit in a big comfortable chair, can help break up monotony and stress. I don&#x27;t see how something being different from the norm has to equal being &quot;different for the sake of difference&quot; or flashy. It&#x27;s a bit insulting to draw a parallel between people who the author thinks are not creative mentally, and tech workers from a company with beanbag chairs.<p>> Silicon valley focuses purely on people whose main problem is that they think their smartphone isn’t bendy enough, or that a 2048 resolution for their TV isn’t good enough. Social problems are largely ignored, especially if the start-ups actually contribute to them. Ifd there is a massive property price problem and inequality being caused by the tech workers, no problem! just bus your workers past the poor people so they don’t get in the way!<p>I highly doubt that every company focuses purely on First World Problems. The fact that we have companies such as Khan Academy, as well as a host of others in the education, environmental, human rights, animal humanity, health, and other fields says a lot about the diversity going on here. Maybe having been here only 3 times may have not been enough to show, but technology is not just the main focus here in SV and SF. A lot of times technology is used as the tool and method to accomplishing other goals, not as the just the focal point.<p>> As an environmentalist, I’m really sick of business people with short term thinking. Many silicon valley types just want to be rich. They don’t care how, or why. The product is irrelevant to them.<p>Summoning a title such as &quot;environmentalist&quot; should be used in arguments related to environmentalism, sustenance, etc. Complaining about people who sell their companies too quick because they just want to make a quick buck does not show any relation to the group you espouse. The actual argument is valid, though. There is a huge temptation to people who don&#x27;t know better and most likely haven&#x27;t done much business or traveling in the valley. However, actually bootstrapping a company and getting it to the point where it can even be considered at a valuation in the millions is a difficult enough road. I think the issue here is also, &quot;many silicon valley types&quot;. Without defining what this term _actually_ means, it&#x27;s hard to clearly understand who the author is talking about.<p>>  You need to know that driver is paying tax, you need to know that driver isn’t someone with a history of violent assaults. You need to know that vehicle is safe to drive, and taxed. These regulations exist for a reason. The same applies to regulations about renting out a house or flat/apartment. There are regulations on fire escapes and insurance and safety for a reason.<p>A very valid point. Anytime you have companies trying to shake up an industry, you also have growing pains. Safety laws are put into practice for a reason, and we need thigns such as thorough background checks to prevent future occurances of events like Uber saw happen in Delhi. There is a fine line to walk here. Laws will need to be created to handle things currently happening now with these kinds of companies. However, waiting on laws to be drafted also hampers the progress that can be made in these fields.<p>> And yup, Positech pays all the tax it should, as a normal company registered in the UK, and paying UK corp tax levels on every penny it earns. It’s really not that difficult to do the right thing.<p>This is a good thing. However, most companies want to keep any money going out down to a minimum, as that is the definition of a company. I would not voluntarily pay more money for a car or a house. Why would I volunteer more money than is needed by the government. Just the same, why would a company; especially if they have people who understand the laws that dictate how much they should pay, and why—and understand the loopholes that exist within those laws. I would not put full blame on the companies, as they are protecting their own neck and trying to ensure their future success; I would rather say this is a clear indicator that tax laws need to be reformed in cases related to these kinds of companies.<p>Over all, there are some very good points made here, but the arguments come off as a bit ranty. I agree a lot with the idea behind the arguments, but also feel the author could do better if he tried to see things from the point of view of others (such as those uncreative beanbag sitters). I also would recommend him to actually truly see Silicon Valley, rather than try to ascribe everyone here to a certain way of acting or believing for just our location.",1418614685

Assange later said in an interview with Rolling Stone that he advised Snowden to go to Russia because it would be safer for him, and stated that the travel document was explicitly to assist him in leaving Hong Kong[3].

Similarly, taking legal &quot;designer drugs&quot; may be safer for the user than taking illegal drugs, despite the extra risk of serious side effects, not only because there&#x27;s less risk of getting arrested, having your children taken away, etc., but also because if something goes wrong, you have recourse — you can sue the pharmacy if the drug is contaminated, they can refer you to a legal collection agency if you don&#x27;t pay them rather than to the Mafia, etc.<p>Of course, we could eliminate this ridiculous dilemma between the risk of novel side effects with &quot;designer drugs&quot; and the risks of illegality with the better-known recreational drugs, simply by making those drugs legal, although that will increase usage.  That also has the additional benefit that it removes much of the stigma and danger from things like hobby chemistry.  So far, it seems to be working well in Colorado and the Netherlands.",1418613056

On human side, many times both opponents and proponents of space robotics pointer out that for big exploration programs humans become more economical - as you still can&#x27;t reproduce human abilities in space with robotics while spending the same resources, if you have big enough goals.<p>Humans have other advantages too. Majority of people in modern NASA workforce say that they become interested in space when watching human space programs. So far no robotic achievements have psychological impact equal to humans in space. Next, there is eternal &quot;explorational&quot; argument - you don&#x27;t really &quot;get&quot; space into your domain until you&#x27;re actually maintain physical presence in it. Unless you at least fly on LEO, you aren&#x27;t in space. Until you fly to the Moon, you don&#x27;t &quot;use&quot; it. Etc.<p>Next, while robotics is advancing with leaps and bounds, human spaceflight doesn&#x27;t stand still. In 1990-s Dan Goldin, NASA administrator, ordered an evaluation of some options of going back to the Moon. The cheapest was using existing rockets - less than 30 tonns on LEO per launch - and the program was for less than a billion dollars. Note that a bunch of technologies used today in manned spaceflight are vastly superior to those used during Project Apollo.<p>Getting to orbit becomes cheaper and safer - SpaceX is another evidence to that, but it&#x27;s not at the end of technical possibilities. When you get spaceflight cheap enough, there is no stop for curious individuals to go to the Moon in person. Same for Mars - at least.<p>What technologies will be employed for traveling in space - that&#x27;s another matter. With cheaper and cheaper energy it will progressively make sense to make more and more safe - even if heavier - human spacecrafts. The more infrastructure in space we have - be it LEO stations, fuel depots on orbit, Moon-based fuel production, Mars navigational network etc - the easier it will be to launch both robots and humans. It&#x27;s hard for me to see why we won&#x27;t want to go.",1418612678

This means the vast majority of planets are effectively uninhabitable just for that reason. And harshly limits the maneuvers possible to get there.<p>* require a sun-like source of radiative energy with a certain minimum intensity (one of the reasons people can&#x27;t survive on Mars without additional UV exposure)<p>* require the presence, in small quantities, of half the elements with an atomic number up to 26, and several found further on. H, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe, and I. Some of these are not very common, and they may be very hard to find. Not finding them first means it becomes impossible to have kids, increased occurrence of things like cancer, and a few years later it becomes lethal.<p>* require gravity. Which is massively inconvenient for operating ... well, anything really<p>* require radiation shielding against solar radiation for long term survival that requires about a hundred kilometers of atmosphere or several inches of metal (if you&#x27;re to survive long term, for short excursions less isolation can be acceptable, also in Low Earth Orbit (like ISS) you&#x27;re still partially shielded by the earth)<p>* require radiation shielding for charged particles that is provided by the earth&#x27;s magnetic field, but requires metal barriers in outside of those fields<p>* require the sun&#x27;s plasma barrier around the solar system to weaken interstellar background radiation to the point that the earth&#x27;s atmosphere/reasonable thickness metal can actually stop it.<p>* require to be inside the galaxy, again to weaken certain types of radiation<p>* require a minimum distance to any supernova explosion of around 50 light years to survive (or yet more shielding)<p>* require to be in groups of at least 50 for long term survival (or we won&#x27;t have enough gene variation and die off over time), even though short excursions can use a limited number of people.

Go changes fast enough that perhaps by this time next week some of these things might have gone away. Some on the other hand might still be there, but what might change is your understanding of the reasons why they exist and what you should do to code around them (or through or whatever...)",1308149972

It takes forever, and completely distracts you from the flow of the game.<p>I used to play RO, and in /bm mode, I had access to 24 hotkeys (qaz rows). Enough? Hell naw.

The second implementation was actually slower than the first because we incurred the overhead of scrolling the bits before we even started to display the new text on the screen.

2657315,comment,2619760,2619871,1,0,mtoddh,,,"<i>Workaholics are (most often) passionate about their work.</i><p>It's interesting to see how often the word ""passion"" comes up with regards to worker productivity, especially when written from the company's perspective. The common refrain seems to be that ""more time spent at work = sign of a more passionate employee"". I have a hunch though that if all companies had to pay overtime rates for every hour an employee spent over 40 hours per week, you'd see fewer articles that equate ""more time at work = more passion"", and start seeing more more articles that equate ""more time at work = bad time management skills"".<p>As it is though, companies arguably have an incentive to focus on measuring the amount of time you spend at work, simply because the more time a salaried employee spends at work, the less it costs the employer on an hourly basis.<p>For instance, given 52 weeks per year minus 4 weeks vacation/holidays/sick-leave, a salaried employee has around 48 weeks per year to work, which translates into the following number of hours:<p><pre><code>  48 weeks * 40 hours/week = 1920 hours\n  48 weeks * 50 hours/week = 2400 hours\n  48 weeks * 60 hours/week = 2880 hours\n</code></pre>\nGoing forward with this, let's say the employee's annual salary is $85k, then disregarding benefits/social security/etc. he's costing his employer the following:<p><pre><code>  40 hour work weeks: $85000 / 1920 hours = $44/hour\n  50 hour work weeks: $85000 / 2400 hours = $35/hour\n  60 hour work weeks: $85000 / 2880 hours = $29/hour\n</code></pre>\n""The more hours you work, the less I'll pay you (on an hourly rate)"" doesn't sound quite as good as ""passionate employees spend lots of time at work."" Of course, the salaried employee could be working longer hours in anticipation of future rewards such as a raise, cashing in stock options, etc. The point though is that simply framing employees who spend lots of time at work as being more passionate is a little disingenuous.<p>When companies hire contractors there is often a clause in the contract that limits the number of hours the contractor can bill. This isn't because companies are trying to limit how ""passionate"" a contractor can be. It's because, unlike a salaried employee, a contractor's hourly rate doesn't go down over 40 hours/week.",1308149312

It seems to me there is a lot of room for cable companies to easily improve their service, yet IMO it remains consistently poor.<p>- On demand selections are limited, and the interface is usually pretty clunky.  If I have a DVR, I have to remember in advance to record something, rather than being able to just grab it after the fact.<p>- You need to have a physical box, which either arrives outdated or quickly becomes outdated, and they never replace it.<p>- It costs $60-$70/month for decent cable service where I live, versus $8/month for Netflix.  Combine that with Hulu and free on-demand streaming from major TV networks, and it's a great bargain.<p>The <i>only</i> thing I miss about having cable is being able to channel surf when I'm bored.

I'm not particularly surprised that an vulnerability like this would get written into the code, it's an easy mistake for an inexperienced developer to make. But I'm not going to pile on the developer. We laud ""separation of concerns"" in our architecture, and this pattern applies to the organization of software development teams.<p>I don't expect every developer to be aware of every vulnerability. But I do expect that a financial institution has a specialist somewhere that audits the code before it is sent for testing (""white box""), and then I expect them to have an independent audit team probe for vulnerabilities (""black box"").<p>After the inexperienced developer has had his code rejected for various flaws, he will become quite aware of the obvious ways things like this can go wrong.<p>Don't get me wrong, I expect that the vast majority of developers wouldn't make this mistake in the first place. But if you aren't a specialist, it is pure hubris to think that you write code that is hardened against <i>all</i> of the attacks out there. And if you have a vulnerability, it really doesn't matter if it's an embarrassingly simple vulnerability or one that requires sophisticated techniques to uncover and exploit. Either way, you're road kill.<p>High-value targets like banks need two security specialists (the code audit and the penetration test) to accompany the development specialists.

Any action on the part of humans can produce ANY result (within certain -wide- limits).<p>""but there is conservation of energy"" - true, but the earth has more than enough energy stored up to heat up the surface to 6300 degrees celcius (at least). The fact that these stores exist means that they got their energy from somewhere. If said energy intake were to increase temperature would obviously drop, potentially by a lot (well, not by that much, it can only drop another 300 degrees after all, but if it were to drop 30 degrees we're all dead anyway, so small changes suck as well). We don't know what affects heat transfer from athmosphere/oceans <-> mantle and reverse, we just know big transfers exist. Suppose, one of the variables had something to do with co2 ... ""whoops""<p>So you want to change earth's climate in a controlled manner ? Too bad. It's the same kind of problem as walking on water. It's perfectly possible to walk on water, you just have to generate the correct amount of force in the correct direction by pushing water down with your feet. You might actually succeed in doing this for the first step, but then you get waves. There is no law of physics that states this directed splashing can't work, but I'm sure you can see what is going wrong in practice.<p>If we modify earth's climate, we'll be creating all sorts of different waves, which will affect our future modifications to the climate, and since we won't be able to correctly predict those waves, we can't know beforehand how things will interact.<p>Unless there are major errors in the theory, changing the climate in predictable ways is impossible.",1308149059

This doesn't work, because the teller acts as security: if something is amiss in the implied security checks, to wit there is no reason one person should be submitting requests regarding lots of account numbers esp. when most of them are invalid; she'll have alerted management & security within seconds of seeing the bizarre request.<p>Your subsequent analogy/justification/complaint is only valid if ONE doctored URL were used.

Just not having that TV as the focal point of the house is really nice, especially since I have a 1 year old to be a dad to.<p>Considering that digital cable is $50+ a month(not including internet), that's enough to buy new laptop or HDTV or iPad every year. Cable won't die, but I wouldn't be surprised if they are forced to eventually morph all of their offerings into a digital package like Netflix where you get Streaming TV + Internet for say $50. Right now I'm paying $35 for cable internet and $8 for Netflix, and a few dollars here and there for Redbox rentals, so $50 a month is just about right for what it <i>should</i> cost for cable companies to do that.",1308148229

And for the ones that actually do decide to maintain a framework that they did not develop themselves [...]<p>How is maintaining an open-source framework that somebody else made different from maintaining a framework built in-house? At the end of the day, bugs will still be found and need to be fixed. Yes, your devs might be more familiar with your framework than with a third-party one, but I think that is only the case if you can keep your team small and prevent churn and specialization. Regardless of which direction you go, devs need to understand what is happening inside the framework - it can't be a magical black box.<p>> [...] it will cost them a lot of money.<p>More than writing something from scratch?",1308147393

Local - Calling conventions, component-local algorithms, etc.<p>Now this is fuzzy for the same reason that one man's strategy is another man's tactics.  But the gist is simple:  you don't tighten the bolts on the system until you have it in the right shape.<p>Local optimizations are easy to do b/c you can usually pull them out of a textbook, or figure it out by looking at one or to parts of code.  Structural optimizations require an understanding of the system performance as a whole -- possibly allowing some suboptimal local behavior.  Sadly the way I've mostly seen is super-tightening the bolts and having the system slowly distort from something suboptimal but flexible into a contorted, performs-ok-but-dont-touch-it terrible beast.  That's the sort of optimization that's the root of all evil.<p>Example:\nI have a webserver, with a table of regexs mapping to handlers. The handlers can be static assets in files or dynamically generated in code.<p>Local optimization: I notice that after URL pattern match, my static assets are read through normal stdio file I/O.  I use sendfile or whatever's the new hotness on my platform to make it fast.<p>Structural optimization: I notice that the majority of my hits are static for a small number of files.  I write a new webserver (say static.foo.com) for them specifically, that looks up the URL in a hash table for an in-memory copy of the file.  I just ping it with SIGHUP when I want to invalidate the hashtable's values.",1308147170

Honestly what was going through my head each time was &quot;should I continue or close the window&quot; rather than automatically going to the next window and continuing.  Check your logs to see where users are abandoning your funnel.  If it is between stages that is probably where you want to make a tweak.",1406246339

8083065,comment,8082849,8083009,7,0,_delirium,,,"You cannot violently throw a tenant out of their apartment, because that is a violent crime. You can violently repel an intruder in self-defense, but if you have actually rented an apartment to someone, they are not an intruder. If, after first renting to them, you later believe they should leave—and they disagree—then you have a dispute about the terms and duration of rental. (It might be a really one-sided dispute in which one side is clearly in the right, but it&#x27;s still a civil dispute.)<p>If their previously lawful residence has become unlawful (e.g. as a result of a failure to pay rent, becoming a nuisance, exceeding an agreed duration, etc.), in that case you proceed in a peaceful, legal fashion: you first give them formal notice that they are required to vacate the property; and if they fail to do so, you get a court order instructing the police or sheriff to remove them. The precise series of steps, and how many days they have to respond, varies by country and state/province (and may also depend on length of occupancy, usually shorter-term tenants being given fewer protections). You cannot <i>yourself</i> adjudicate and enforce the dispute, because vigilante justice is disfavored in most civilized countries. If, say, a client failed to pay your contracting bill for a job they owe you money for, you cannot walk into their cafeteria with a baseball bat, threaten the cashier, and seize the money that is legitimately yours. Instead you have to sue them in court, get a judgment, and then have the judgment enforced. There are ways you are allowed to enforce your legitimate claim, and ways that are... not allowed.",1406246337

Then since it is still trivial to circumvent by technical means they add laws to try and restrict technical circumvention of the censorship. Then as loopholes are found in the laws against circumvention they have to broaden and deepen those. Soon it is illegal just to know things, to tell people basic knowledge of how to do things.

For example, my wife and I like photography and most of the pictures on our walls are ones we&#x27;ve taken, printed on canvas or high quality photo paper. But we don&#x27;t own a high-end photo printer, nor do we want to do the work of mounting canvas on frames. I&#x27;ve worked with such devices, they&#x27;re not that expensive, but I just don&#x27;t see myself buying a wide-format printer any time soon. I&#x27;d rather pay someone else to do so a few times a year. By contrast, I have been thinking about getting a new laser printer for everyday use and reading long documents - I don&#x27;t enjoy reading everything on a screen.<p>I suspect that many people may end up owning a cheapie 3d printer for small things, but they&#x27;ll outsource to a local hub when they want more than basic quality. I&#x27;m very into the idea of 3d printing, but the simpler, cheaper units are very limited - as evidenced by people at Maker Faires wearing plastic hats that they printed themselves.

See: <a href=""http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lamont/2013/09/18/harvard-extension-school-resume-guidelines-are-bogus/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/lamont/2013/09/18/harvard-exten...</a><p>The second problem, and I think the reason behind the first problem, is that the formal way to list a degree on a resume is not by the school one attended but by the university that grants the degree. That is, an HBS graduate would list their degree as an MBA from Harvard University; an HLS graduate would list their degree as a JD from Harvard University. Harvard&#x27;s method of identifying the school is that it awards unique degrees according to which school was intended. Thus an MBA will always come from HBS. A JD will always come from HLS. There is no BA or MA from Harvard Extension School, but rather a BLA or MLA. In this way, the correct listing of a BLA from Harvard Extension School is distinguishable from a BA from Harvard College, but of course, only for a person who knows the difference (or doesn&#x27;t assume the &quot;L&quot; is a typo). This is, in my view, more a problem of poor convention than of anything else.<p>Yes, there are also people who plainly abuse language to mislead people. They make people like myself (&#x27;07 ALMM program) very self-conscious when it comes to talking about my education there. I never brag about the Harvard name. If pressed I refer to my program as &quot;Harvard&#x27;s night school for working adults&quot; (because let me assure you - nobody knows what the hell &quot;Extension School&quot; mean anyway). It&#x27;s a shame that there&#x27;s no clear, accurate way for HES students to talk about their programs without denigrating their own accomplishments or risking being impostors.<p>Finally, there is one bit of praise I would like to bestow upon HES that cannot be said for any of Harvard&#x27;s other schools: HES is the most meritocratic academic system I have ever seen. Your success boils down to whether you can do the work and whether you put in the time. It doesn&#x27;t matter what your grades were in high school. It doesn&#x27;t matter how much money your family has donated. It doesn&#x27;t matter if you can throw a football. The requirements for admittance are as black and white as they come. If you show up, do the work, and get good grades, you&#x27;ll get admitted. If you take three classes and can&#x27;t consistently get Bs or better, you will be rejected no matter how much money or legacy you waive in front of the school. I hope someday the rest of academia will consider this model.",1406243400

8082863,comment,8081556,8082326,3,0,ics,,,"I have sympathy for left-turners in particularly busy intersections where there is no turn light. Driving in NYC, you pretty much have to nudge as close to the opposing lane as you can until the light turns yellow/red and you can scoot yourself out of gridlock. Furthermore, you must account for streets which are one way, too narrow, full, or active to stop and turn around. However, this was not the situation I was really talking about at all.<p>The scenario I had in mind while writing my post is that of the local road which crosses a major stretch of highway. Such highways might be an actual interstate, a busy two-lane highway, etc. One of the worst types of road to cross is the one that is far too wide for its own good– an ambitious 6-lane road with not enough traffic to ever be full (Trenholm Road in SC, ahem), but enough so that drivers spread out across all lanes and make crossing very annoying sometimes. There are parts of the Taconic (NY) that pretty bad to cross, though I&#x27;m usually the one on the highway. The local cross sometimes gets backed up 5-10 cars, 2-3 of which are stuck in the median. Getting on the highway or going around by going the next town can add 10+ miles. Letting someone cross by slowing down a bit and changing lanes is not, in my opinion, a smug assault on the efficiency of those driving on the highway... it&#x27;s just something a few people do when they recognize that nothing is very efficient anyway. (Note that I haven&#x27;t said much about safety because it was only a small part of their comment, and not the part I was responding to. I hope it&#x27;s clear that I am <i>not</i> advocating for people to test fate by slamming their brakes to let someone curtsy across the pavement.)",1406243101

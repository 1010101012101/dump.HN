8601082,comment,8599955,8600295,0,0,beagle3,,,"> No it isn&#x27;t.<p>Self experimentation <i>could</i> be an excellent source of data. Quite a few &quot;interesting&quot; things cannot effectively be rigorously tested, either because we have no effective placebo, or because they are inhumane (e.g., the vast majority of so-called &quot;rigorous&quot; diet studies are actually based on self-reporting and willful compliance, because you can&#x27;t keep people in controlled a lab for more than a few weeks). Also, as Ionnadis pointed out, quite a bit of (supposedly rigourous) published research is simply wrong.<p>So for a lot of things, we have to do with &quot;amateur hour&quot; experiments, whether conducted in a university lab and published in Nature, or conducted at home and published in a blog.<p>Self-experimentation can easily disprove a &quot;general truth&quot; but cannot really support one due to lack of controls ( and do recall the scientific method is statement about disproving things, not about proving them) However, if you do stumble on a local version of a &quot;general truth&quot;, you can then look for the n->inf version more rigorously.<p>You can look at e.g. the late Seth Roberts for examples; the ideas are interesting, some of his successes have been replicated by enough people; Among these - correlation between Vitamin D intake time and sleep quality (see gwern for a rigorous test of that experiment, that confirms it for n=|{gwern}|=1, and many other less rigorous;  Rigorous correlation among flax seed (supposedly omega 3) intake, butter, bacon and response time for n=|{seth}|=1, which I have not published but have verified rigorously for n=|me|=1 about flax seed. And there are a few others. I think some of his ideas are crazy but almost all are interesting.<p>(Self-reported) success on his Shangri-La diet is ~80%, which is very high for a diet, but obviously not a general truth since it is not 100%. It worked for me once, but not the 2nd time a couple of years later despite following exactly the same protocol. I&#x27;d say self-experimentation is much less rigorous, but way more time-and-captial efficient way of arriving at results.",1415879937

It should also be noted that despite its higher resolution, its larger size means that compared to the Nexus 5 the pixel density only increases 12% from 441 PPI to 493 PPI. The use of a PenTile RGBG subpixel layout also means that there is actually an overall decrease in subpixel density.</i><p><i>> Overall, the Nexus 6 display is quite poor relative to the displays on other smartphones like the Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6, and HTC One (M7). It&#x27;s also a definite regression from the display on the Nexus 5, which is concerning given the fact that the Nexus 6 is $300 more expensive. It has been speculated that Motorola is unable to source the latest generation of panels from Samsung Display, which would explain why many of the panel characteristics are similar to previous generation AMOLED panels in the Note 3 and Galaxy S4.

I find it easier, cheaper and faster to deploy Linux applications than it is to boot a Windows server, apply updates, secure it and install your application (and keep it updated). I know it can all be done - and automated to a large extent - with Microsoft admin tools, but it still takes longer than spinning up a new Debian, Ubuntu or CentOS server and doing the same steps. The ecosystem is just not there. And since you don&#x27;t need to worry about licensing costs, you can deploy as many machines as you need and make them role-specific, lighter and individually simpler.<p>> - Apple: Expensive. Nice.<p>Expensive is relative. My previous MacBook was still solid after five years. No Lenovo/Dell/HP has that kind of build quality at a lower price and the ones that have that build are uglier and more expensive than their Apple counterparts. I agree if you need a fingerprint or smartcard reader, you can&#x27;t go with Apple, but those are specific needs. Spreading the cost of a Mac over its useful life makes it look more attractive than a PC. Plus, it has a very developer-friendly OS if you are not developing for Windows.<p>Also, Apple makes desktop machines. My comment was mostly about BizSpark&#x27;s server side.",1415878277

The community edition is not only free of charge, but open-source as well. Visual Studio needs the Resharper plugin by IntelliJ, to be able to call it a modern IDE.<p>It also has really good plugins for many languages, besides Java, like Scala, Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, Clojure and Groovy.<p>My colleagues that are doing Ruby development are saying that it&#x27;s the best IDE for Ruby. Whereas myself, as a Scala developer, I&#x27;m saying that it&#x27;s the best IDE for Scala - the Scala plugin for example is still not as smart as the Java functionality, but has everything you&#x27;d expect out of an IDE, like amazing autocompletion and magical debugging with inspection - personally I feel that IntelliJ IDEA for Scala is better than Visual Studio for C# without Resharper.<p>Its only problem is that there&#x27;s no support for C#. This is because people doing C# are doing it on Windows with Visual Studio, so there wasn&#x27;t demand. But say that demand increases for cross-platform stuff due to these moves by Microsoft, IntelliJ IDEA will probably gain C# support and if IntelliJ the company is the one that does it, then it&#x27;s going to be darn good.<p>So don&#x27;t get me wrong, but for cross-platform stuff alternatives already exist and even if Microsoft releases Visual Studio cross-platform, problem is that it will have serious competition, plus they&#x27;ll have to poor serious resources into it and frankly I&#x27;m not seeing it happening - IntelliJ IDEA is built in Java and runs on the JVM, hate it or love it, for IntelliJ it is easy to port it to other platforms. Visual Studio on the other hand, well, it probably has very Windows-specific guts. So a cross-platform port probably won&#x27;t happen.<p>But what I&#x27;m seeing happening is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse (hopefully IDEA, since it&#x27;s my favorite).

This was perhaps the biggest wow feature of the language when I learned to use it well.<p>* Functional languages tend to encourage immutability. F# works idiomatically with mutable data as well, thus being well suited for e.g. numerical code.  I would call this letting us have the cake and eat it too.<p>* I don&#x27;t think there are any specific downsides to F#. Some programs are better expressed in C# still but the .Net platform allows one to access those classes seamlessly from F# side.<p>IMHO, these are all wins.

SQLite is available pretty much everywhere, Android even allows full-text search. Now what you have to do is synchronize SQLite dbs. It &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; be too hard to remove old emails from the db so you can keep X MB worth of it. You can even shoehorn it into couchbase-lite [3][4] so that sync is automagically taken care of.<p>I&#x27;ve considered sqlite for some of these reasons. But couchbase-lite != sqlite, right? (Or does it use sqlite <i>in a meaningful way</i>; ie: can/should one use sql to interface with the stored data?). Btw, looks like you&#x27;re off-by-one, in your references ;-)<p>If using sqlite, there are a couple of schemas one might use for inspiration, such as dbmail:<p><a href=""http://dbmail.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/dbmail-er-model.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dbmail.org/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php/dbmail-er-model...</a><p>Or archiveopteryx:<p><a href=""http://archiveopteryx.org/db/schema"" rel=""nofollow"">http://archiveopteryx.org/db/schema</a><p>The main sticking point, is do we really want(need) to re-index everything everywhere, how do we transparently do search local-first, while supporting hits from the server along with fetching hits/mails that are missing locally (what k9 calls &quot;cloud search&quot;) - how do we consolidate/sync data (the two hard things in computer science is caching and naming things...).<p>I&#x27;m not entirely convinced sqlite+built-in full text search is the best approach (I envision a useful search across some gbs of mailing list threads -- not convinced about the ranking -- but I could very well be the victim of premature optimization. And I&#x27;m a little wary of abandoning maildir for storage (on the server) -- but that might be useful anyway.<p>> JMAP looks cool (definitely more interesting to implement than IMAP) but it seems to be more a query API than a sync API, although there are facilities to &quot;get changes since last time&quot; (a HUGE improvement from IMAP as deployed everywhere).<p>Yes, that&#x27;s pretty much what I gathered from the heliotrope story, that syncing was a bit of a mess.<p>> OTOH if you can shoehorn it into couchbase-lite, you can use a generic sync protocol that can be used for other things too (caldav/carddav).<p>Exactly. All the hard work done! For free! But seriously, couchdb was born from the ashes of lotus notes, and at least in spirit it was made for this kind of stuff... so couchdb sync, and some kind of half-assed search might be the way to go (on the server, elastic-search would probably work fine... not sure about on something like Android).<p>> Heck, you&#x27;ve piqued my curiosity, I see something doable here. I&#x27;d love to hear more. I might even hack something just for fun.<p>Great :-) If you do, please feel free to drop me an email (see profile).<p>[mk] <a href=""https://github.com/karelzak/mutt-kz"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/karelzak/mutt-kz</a>\n[a] <a href=""https://github.com/pazz/alot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/pazz/alot</a>",1415877468

Bender), although a big issue there is you <i>have</i> to go to court to see whether this specific NCA is enforceable or not. I would guess it&#x27;s not (because it&#x27;s completely unreasonable), and Amazon&#x27;s behaviour is not entirely dissimilar to SLAPP.<p>edit: in fact, Amazon was essentially told to fuck off in what seems to be a different NCA case: <a href=""http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a5cde10f-9ca3-43c7-bfa9-5eb13db9d17d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a5cde10f-9ca3-...</a><p>> When Amazon learned that Mr. Powers joined Google, it first engaged in discussions with Google about Mr. Powers&#x27; employment.

After Mr. Powers successfully removed the case to a Federal District Court in Washington, Amazon moved for a preliminary injunction against Mr. Powers to enforce the non-compete restrictions.<p>> <i>The court denied most of Amazon&#x27;s requests</i>, and upheld the non-compete restriction only to the extent that it prohibited Mr. Powers, for a period of 9 months from the date he last had access to Amazon confidential information, from servicing any customer as to which he had obtained confidential information* during his employment at Amazon (<i>this restriction was essentially the same restriction as the one Mr. Power voluntarily agreed to upon joining Google</i>).<p>> […]<p>> With respect to the validity of the non-compete restrictions, the court next determined that the restrictions were enforceable only to the extent that they sought to prevent Mr. Powers from working with his former Amazon customers. The court also determined, however, that <i>Amazon&#x27;s attempt to uphold the more general &quot;worldwide&quot; ban against competition — i.e., not tied to specific customers — was unenforceable because it was unreasonable</i> and Amazon failed to show how such a restriction was necessary to protect its business.<p>(emphasis mine)",1415877423

The more you use it, the more features you should discover and find useful. Trying to flatten the learning curve by removing features (or making it much harder to discover them) just keeps more users from ever advancing beyond the &quot;novice&quot; stage, because there isn&#x27;t all that much more to discover.<p>Power users became power users because they explored and discovered more functionality, and this is because they were motivated to explore in the first place; extremely simplified UIs reduce much of this motivation, which results in less power users - and eventually developers. Maybe &quot;we don&#x27;t want power users and want them to disappear&quot; is their goal (I hope not but wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it implicitly is), but this constant trend of lowest-common-denominator dumbing-down apps is, in the long term, not beneficial to anyone.<p>Software should have defaults that make it easy to use initially for the beginner, but it should also encourage growth of the user&#x27;s knowledge. Instead we get software that&#x27;s easy to use initially - and then effectively stunts their growth, and all the aesthetics they throw at it cannot compensate for functionality. I think it&#x27;s really quite sad; although if you believe in the theory that Google is aiming to take away user&#x27;s control over their devices and replace it with Google&#x27;s, then it makes a lot of sense to keep users as blissfully ignorant as possible.

Some key excerpts:<p>> Amazon gave me their ﬁnal offer: 4 weeks of severance for 18 months of adhering to the broad non-compete that would not allow me to earn a living in my ﬁeld, and further explained that if I didn&#x27;t accept their ﬁnal offer, Amazon would sue me for tens of thousands of dollars in relocation expenses.<p>Employee complained, was fired, Amazon insists s/he can&#x27;t work for another 1 1/2 years (I know that&#x27;s legal in the US, but it&#x27;s still asshole-ish behaviour).<p>> What we found was that there were tens of thousands of Kindle e-ink owners, the vast majority who hadn’t even seen the promotion details (as customers had to click on the ad to see the details), were qualifying for the $10 Gift card because every day, there are thousands of customers who own a Kindle and already have Discover set as their 1-click default card, that buy a digital good on Amazon in the ordinary course of their activity.<p>> Meanwhile the promotion continued to run and within a few more days we had gone over the $500,000 budget.<p>Discover Card pays $500 000 for a campaign that gives $10 to each user who switches default 1-click card to Discover. Amazon gives $10 mostly to users who <i>already</i> have Discover as default. Munira, the manager, lies to Discover about that.<p>> Munira was forced to admit under oath in deposition [...] that she falsiﬁed her educational record on her resume to Amazon and all her previous employers - claiming to have earned a Bachelors and Masters degree in Computer Science from Stanford when in fact she earned no degrees at all.<p>Munira is a liar/cheater, and still employed at Amazon.",1415876763

I still think the visual feedback from a good IDE is worthwile and the user interface is usually much easier to work with.",1415876528

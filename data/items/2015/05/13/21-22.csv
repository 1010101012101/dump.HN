I am concerned for my kids&#x27; future lives, but I&#x27;m not overly concerned about perfect scores or anything like that. I would prefer to instill in them a passion for something--anything really.<p>I went to a <i>pretty good</i> school (Northwestern), and while I don&#x27;t regret it, I also don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s particularly affected my life one way or another. A state school diploma could have gotten me into my first position, and from there on out it was my performance that led me from one step to the next. It wasn&#x27;t until I started to learn and build things for the love of it that I really started to create bigger and better opportunities.<p>I now live in a community in Austin that has some similarities to what you&#x27;re describing. Super-competitive, high-achievers. But I think it&#x27;s important to maintain a healthy appreciation for the artifice of it all. And while we encourage and try to feed the strengths and interests of our kids (I am helping my 6-year-old prep for an advanced math class), I think it&#x27;s more important to try to raise happy, well-adjusted, non-jerk kids.",1431554382

Quite obviously it&#x27;s not in all bread, but you&#x27;ll find it in most if not all industrial bread and even in many local bakeries (you won&#x27;t find it in a good bakery though). The actual chemical process for extracting cysteine is boiling the hair in hydrochloric acid, which separates it into other stuff and a white powder, which is the cysteine.<p>Whether you personally eat that bread is not very relevant for this discussion, but for what it&#x27;s worth, I personally think that whether cysteine is made from duck feathers or from human hair is irrelevant, it&#x27;s chemically the same molecule. I generally bake my own bread, but when I don&#x27;t I have no qualms about eating bread with cysteine in it, and if my own bread would taste better with cysteine I would put it in.

The controversy of GamerGate was not that there was sexism among gamers. It was that there was conflict regarding when someone complains about sexism. The debate turned away from the salient issue and to arguing for and against whether there should even be a debate. People were complaining about other people complaining, which leads to complaints about those people complaining and so on.<p>Of the public shaming instances I&#x27;ve been aware of, the discussion on the internet has been about whether or not the incident should have been made public, and less about justifying or recriminating what originally happened.<p>It&#x27;s an odd and frustrating social feedback loop.

Rather than leaving them up as a reminder of (or, school officials feared, an homage to) suicide’s lasting effects, the administration unceremoniously hosed them away within hours. The students were left feeling wronged, their voices and feelings silenced.&quot;</i><p><i>> Lisa hasn’t found the grief counselors provided by the school to be of much help. “They kind of, like, force you to talk to them,” she says, “but you don’t know them, and they don’t know you, and every time you get a brand-new person.”</i><p><i>> Kathleen Blanchard, the mother of Jean-Paul, who died in 2009, has some simple advice for parents: “Talk less. Listen more. Listen deeply.” She’s speaking at a community event to an auditorium full of parents who are wondering what, if any, signals she saw in her son. “He sent out signs to people by phone and online,” she says. “He even let people know that he intended to take his life. But they didn’t understand.”</i><p>There&#x27;s a reason why pedagogies like Montessori/Waldorf/etc. schools tend to work well. The educators who designed those systems understood the importance of having tight feedback loops and small social groups for children to develop into fulfilled, productive citizens.<p>Having teachers who get to know the students over several years, in small classrooms, with healthy parental involvement, and school officials that are in tune with what&#x27;s happening really does help. It&#x27;s the kind of stuff that just seems like commons sense when you see it in practice, and yet the vast majority of our schools are diametrically opposed to that.

In a libvirt-managed qemu environment when the OS has its serial console enabled, you can run &quot;virsh console MyVM&quot; and instantly start executing commands and parsing their output. You can also have the OS write its log to serial so that if the OS crashes you can still read the full log. When all else fails, serial still works. Additionally, a virtual VGA device has an infinitely larger attack surface than a serial device.<p>When doing unattended windows installs, a lot of people use floppy drives to store the Autounattend.xml file. Floppy disk images are the most trivial and smallest images for automation tools to create. They&#x27;re additionally useful for placing a linux bootloader on to boot a linux install CD with command line parameters.<p>Most people still use CD-ROM images to install operating systems, and it&#x27;s basically required for windows.

Giving up that control is difficult to do. When you have a marketing department, they assume they know what is best for the user and what features the user needs and at what time (all the features done by day X). The developer ends up being a code monkey who&#x27;s hired to implement exactly what some MBA (or even worse, non-MBA!) wants.

You don&#x27;t really need marketing or a manager calling the shots because you can go to the customer directly (or through the customer proxy who also is with your agile team every single day).

That thing that&#x27;s is random (oh look, a brick just fell off the truck in front on me and it went through a car window immediately snuffing out the passenger&#x27;s life), capricious (childhood cancer?), and just plain everyday (most people eat other animals on a daily basis).<p>Additionally, if you look at history you&#x27;ll see that attitudes towards death vary greatly. From celebrations of the dead, to fear of the dead, to just a shrug.<p>Meanwhile you have video games that play with the idea of death and destruction, just like much of Indo-European epics have for millennia.<p>God of War has you killing the gods and everything in your path, including innocents. All because you killed your family.<p>Super Meat Boy has a brilliant scene when you first get to the afterlife and you see thousands of copies of you raining down into a hellscape. I didn&#x27;t count, but as the game keeps track of how many times you&#x27;ve died, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if it&#x27;s raining the dead versions of all your failures.<p>Then there&#x27;s the really disturbing (in the good way) take of Binding of Isaac or  Braid or Limbo.

The importance is getting to market.<p>Apparently they&#x27;re using Rails or PHP at Bigcommerce. If you&#x27;re trying to get to market as fast as possible then Rails makes sense but what goes with Rails is TDD. You really shouldn&#x27;t have too much technical debt when you&#x27;re using Rails or Ruby.<p>On the other hand, if they&#x27;re using PHP then I&#x27;d bet a lot of money that they have a lot of technical debt because they hired poorly skilled developers who were able to push through some code that <i>looks</i> like the feature requested.<p>At some point, you will be crushed under the weight of your own technical debt. The race is whether your startup will die before that point. The author sounds like he&#x27;s trying to get acceptance that there will <i>always</i> be technical debt. How about letting your engineers working on refactoring and making things nicer?<p>Facebook could have been crushed by their technical debt but instead they let their engineers loose on the code base. That&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve come up with Hack lang which is type-annotated PHP, and that&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve come up with flow, the javascript type checker. This is why they made it a mission to allow developers to be able to fix and deploy some code within 1 week of starting a job. All of that forces them to fight against technical debt and to keep themselves in the game.<p>That&#x27;s the real issue here; sure it sucks creating technical debt in an effort to get to market first, but it sucks even worse when as an engineer you aren&#x27;t allow to tackle the debt at any point or are only allowed to tackle it very rarely. Efficiency is what will keep the dollars rolling in.<p>A recent example involving Google is Chrome. People are actively switching back to Firefox or another browser. There&#x27;s bloat in Chrome! How&#x27;s that possible?! My bet is a product manager who isn&#x27;t allowing the engineers to fight the technical debt in the code.",1431551632

There was always an underlying social pressure that everything they did should be perfect -- nothing would be accepted but the best.

For sure, any event that happens in Palo Alto grabs the connection of well connected people who can get lots of media attention for their concerns, so there has been a lot of reporting and commentary about this issue. This article kindly submitted for our discussion from the <i>Modern Luxury</i> website is just the latest in a large collection of articles by nonspecialists on suicide in Palo Alto. But maybe the problem will appear to go away as the random clumping of individual suicides occurs in some poorer and less well connected community next year.<p>Of course I desire for all young people everywhere to live long, healthy, and happy lives, and if there is something toxic about the culture in Palo Alto, let&#x27;s by all means do something to fix it. But one part of that effort is to better understand suicide and its prevention, a topic I post about fairly often here on Hacker News. (Check my other posts just from today. I research this issue a lot.)

It&#x27;s obvious that the system servicing billions of people and businesses around the world would dwarf the energy tab of a system that services a relative handful of niche users. Why even bother with such a clearly flawed comparison?<p>> <i>The cost of all the energy used will tend towards the price of the subsidy+fees, and the subsidy is being phased out. In a few decades the subsidy will be almost gone.</i><p>Yes, the subsidy will drop but the energy costs will continue to rise and the fees will obviously have to rise to compensate for the absence of subsidies (otherwise the miners will be losing money).<p>> <i>If bitcoin completely replaced finance, would it really use more energy than saved by finance stopping?</i><p>Finance will never &quot;stop&quot;. Demand for consumer financial services (like banks, loans, credit & debit cards, etc)  would remain pretty much the same, even with bitcoin at the core of finance. The cost of &quot;mining&quot; dollars is negligible compared to the ancillary financial services that people actually care about, so replacing dollars with bitcoin simply adds the extra energy of bitcoin mining into the mix. If bitcoin were cheaper than the legacy system, then why is it that all bitcoin companies prefer to use &quot;offchain transactions&quot; (aka non-bitcoin transactions) whenever possible? The answer is that the blockchain is incredibly inefficient compared to the legacy financial system. Payment gateways like bitpay that have no choice but to interact with the blockchain have spent lots of money building trusted node networks in order to roll their own double-spend detection heuristics because relying on bitcoin&#x27;s inherent security is <i>too slow</i> for the needs of an actual business. The only problem bitcoin solves is &quot;decentralized&quot; which isn&#x27;t a problem for most people.",1431551343

Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100, with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[1] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[2] If I remember correctly, there was a previous Hacker News submission of an article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years. Here’s why&quot;[3] That article gives a lot of background information about why mortality and morbidity are going down, and thus life expectancy is increasing at all ages. Life expectancy at age 40, at age 60, and at even higher ages is still rising throughout the both developed countries and the still developing countries of the world.[4] It&#x27;s not just newborns and young children who have better life expectancies than ever before, but everyone in most countries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2860ef54d218ce5ce19abe6a59/dc_biodemography_of_human_ageing_nature_2010_vaupel.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.demographic-challenge.com/files/downloads/2eb51e2...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prb.org/Journalists/Webcasts/2010/humanlongevity....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_longevity/2013/09/life_expectancy_history_public_health_and_medical_advances_that_lead_to.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science_of_...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a>",1431551254

It&#x27;s just as hard to demonstrate that what seems like two distinct and opposing things are actually the same thing, and it&#x27;s just that you&#x27;ve allowed yourself to grow into this mind that believes otherwise. You can see every life as something that is in a constant decay towards death, and you can see everything that has decayed to contribute to the creation of new life. Stars don&#x27;t have life or death, yet we come from them. At some point our own complexity perplexes us, and is that where we draw the line?<p>As someone who has as well, dealt with more thinking about death than most people ever will in their life, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll ever see how I see things get expressed in a video game. I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s capable of being expressed.",1431550903

Good to demonstrate the failure modes, rather than attempt to project complete infallibility.<p>I also like the secondary classification it does of people, looking for a &#x27;notable person&#x27; match.",1431550860
9541950,comment,9540094,9540564,0,0,ahallock,,,"Yeah, I hope they can find some middle ground; there&#x27;s a definite need for AirBnB. I remember back when I worked at a Motel 6 and all the hotels in the area would sell out on weekends when there was a popular event. The hotels were also able to charge &quot;surge&quot; pricing so to speak, and some people had no choice but to pay the huge costs. AirBnB could have handled the overflow. So maybe some regulations could allow for special events. I think that was original use case, anyway.",1431550858

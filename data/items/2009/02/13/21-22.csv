Here's some top results:<p>ny lottery - 450,000 January searches<p>nys lottery - 110,000 January searches<p>pick lottery numbers - 18,100<p>lottery past numbers - 14,800<p>new york lottery results - 12,100<p>Other interesting results: ny lottery org (12,100), nyc lottery (9,900), new york lottery com (6,600), nyc numbers (3,600), www ny lottery org (2,400)... and finally ny winning lottery numbers (1,000 - first mention of winning in combination with the way I typed the words in).<p>So, yes, these terms are getting searched. A lot of people are looking for the newest numbers, so if you could automatically have those post up, that'd add value to your site. Now, the way you'll get traffic to this site I'm guessing is SEO - so start thinking about a domain and keywords you want to go after. Monetizing? Totally doable I'd imagine, but not sure how you'd go about it. Links to playing or buying lottery something-or-other online might be good. Maybe sit in a convenience store and ask everyone who buys a lottery ticket if you can talk to them for a couple minutes, and ask them like five questions about their interests.<p>Do people who play the NY lottery like horseracing? The Yankees? Hot dogs? Going to Miami? It seems to me like you could get traffic with some effort, and could monetize with some effort, but the effort thing is key here. You're going to have to mess around and experiment to figure out the monetization side, and going to have to spend some time getting pagerank and relevancy if you want high traffic. But - it seems doable, and I'm going to guess you could carve out a few hundred bucks a week without too much effort, which is pretty cool. Good luck with the endeavor.",1234561535

When I went to cut back down a year ago, I drank a ton of diet sports drinks, and then just planned to each 350-600 calories 3-6 times per day, and executed on my plan. When I was hungry outside of my meal times, I just slammed a diet sports drink or seltzer water, and it worked well for me. Even if artificial sweeteners stimulate more appetite later, or don't satiate well, the gains from hydrating yourself could likely be worth it. But I suppose you could just use water, tea, or something else instead of diet soda.<p>Final thought: I think people notice a lot of heavier people drinking diet drinks, which might seem to support the theory, but there could be some causation/correlation error there. People with slower metabolisms and people who are already above their target weight are more likely to drink diet drinks. People with ultra-fast metabolisms are more likely not to worry about it.",1234560504

Can you imagine an politician, of any ideology, seriously taking this suggestion and lasting more than a few months at it before they are overridden by congress, or the courts, or someone else comes in to give it a try? Its purpose is not honest suggestion; it is instead designed to make Greenspun and those who agree with him feel good about their beliefs, and perhaps convince interested readers to entertain a similar belief system as well.<p>If you really want to give Obama suggestions, and you really want them to be taken, you ought to make them feasible.<p>The way forward is via productive compromise and incremental progress -- and that's one of the ways in which libertarianism fails completely: when has any of you ever suggested a small step? Instead you snipe from the margins about the philosophical inequity of it all.<p>Further along the lines of not articulating a vision for the future:<p>- The vast majority of suggestions are negative -- what we must <i>not</i> do or change -- rather than positive.<p>- Libertarian policy is exclusively derived from absolute philosophical first principles with zero consideration as to empirical effectiveness, side effects, or how-do-we-get-there-from-here. It's nice for utopian fiction and useless for the rest of us.<p>p.s. I like how you brush aside so much of the ugliness of that era as ""incidences."" Assume I take you at your word that things ""fiscal"" were generally Good: how were things ""liberty"" then, hmmm?

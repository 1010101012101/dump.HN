This makes sense given that each city will take some time before users discover and start using the service, and the authors looked into this in more detail by tracking the number of ads present in each local site.

Yes, managing keys might be tricky - but it&#x27;s not really rocket science. The thing that&#x27;s hard is managing trust -- which key one trusts etc. The CA system for web is completely broken. I had some hope for cacert.org -- I think that model (perhaps expanded to include recommending signing gpg-keys as well as x509 certs) has a lot of merit.<p>I think web of trust is the only thing that <i>can</i> work for managing trust. But it needs to be accessible. Have post offices and banks sign gpg keys on when people come in with valid id. Cacert is a different take -- I like to look on it as a &quot;strucutred eternal keysigning party&quot;. I trust that model a lot more than the classic CA model. But as it is based on the CA model, it suffers the same problems with centralized trust. Centralized trust is great for organizations, it&#x27;s not so great for individuals.<p>I think the best model would be a world-wide web of trust for gpg, helped by formal and informal signing organizations (ie: like cacert, signinparties -- and with the help of banks, governments, DMV and similar institutions that traditionally help with issuing IDs). Then there should be support for anchoring DNS/CAs (and CAs for openssh) with gpg. So that if you trust someone is a representative of an organization linked to a domain name, you can trust them to autorize a CA for that name (there&#x27;s technical details here, but I think the idea should be clear enough).<p>CAs go away, everyone can sign their own certs -- and there&#x27;s an easy way to link x509 and gpg trust.<p>People will still lose their keys, and get invalid keys signed etc -- key management <i>is</i> hard. But the really confounding thing is trust -- and knowing how to determine which keys are &quot;proper&quot; keys for a given entity. That&#x27;s really trust management, not (just) key management.<p>[ed:1 whops, that was the other article on making key management easy ;-) But I suppose this comment is relevant wrt how to make encryption more readily available...]",1423279309

9012922,comment,9009988,9012304,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"Learn a Lisp (say, Scheme or Common Lisp). For Lisp family, this is bread and butter. Since the source code itself is at the same time a data structure, you can (and often end up doing it) easily generate code at read time, compile time or run time. The border between those three kind of starts to blur.<p>Your example could look like this in Common Lisp:<p><pre><code>    (defun fib (n)
      (if (< n 2)
          n
          (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
    
    (defmacro spliced-fibs (x n)
       `(case ,x
              ,(map-iota (lambda (v) (list v (fib v))) n)))

    (defun hardcoded-fib (num)
        (spliced-fibs num 29))
</code></pre>
spliced-fibs macro will generate you a full case block at compile time, so the hardcoded-fib will be basically one big switch/case block. map-iota call maps a function over a list of numbers from 0 to n. Note that a macro can call ordinary functions at compile time, which themselves can use other macros, etc. So a lot of code can be used both at compile and run time.",1423278641

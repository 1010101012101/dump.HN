I worked as a cog in a moderately sized company that had been around for a good deal of time. I felt like the work I did didn't honestly matter. I was scolded harshly for my mistakes and hardly recognized for my achievements. Now I'm doing web development with two other guys in a cool little house-turned-office. I show up when I want to and I dress how I want to. I'm appreciated for my work, and I feel like I'm actually doing something useful.<p>I can understand how the whole ""dress like you want to and show up when you can"" thing can make people automatically think of laziness, but I really disagree. I show up when I'm ready to get some shit done. When I was working at the more ""standard"" business, I had to show up at 8, whether or not I was actually capable of doing any sort of real work. I'm far more productive being able to set my own hours, and so are my two co-workers. We do in a week what used to take my previous employer over a month to do (with a significantly smaller workforce).",1254441158

The big problem is devising the algorithm for what you are doing, properly selecting libraries and understanding how maintainable the approach you are using is (patterns). Maybe I am in the minority, but the biggest time sink for me is fundamental mistakes I would make regardless of the programming language I am using. I do prefer a dynamically typed language with lambda expressions, though.... certainly faster and more fun.",1254439186

856045,comment,855245,855559,0,0,derwiki,,,"I work at a start up now after working at the largest software corporation for about two years, and I guess I see the complete opposite. Sure, at the start up, we can dress how we like, show up when we want, etc.. but honestly, people dress the same as they did at the corporation, and people show up at roughly the same time. And I feel (and see) more of a trend of personal responsibility at the start up. With 20 engineers, there's no one to pass the buck to: if something breaks from your area, you fix it. Especially dealing with a live site with millions of customers, versus a two year release cycle at my previous job.<p>I'm going to have to disagree on the point of expertise too. At my corporate job, I tried bringing up functional programming at a happy hour and got a lot of blank stares. Anything programming related that was not directly related to the job, my coworkers didn't seem to care about. At the start up, people learn different languages for fun and try to stay up with new technology.<p>I know that all I've done is provide more anecdotal evidence, but my experience has been so 180 degree opposite from yours, Markus, that I felt compelled to comment. I guess the big difference I see is that of passion: corporate programmers are rarely super excited about what they work on, and start up programmers almost have to be. I'm not saying passion means a better product or success, but I'd choose working with passionate people any day of the week.",1254438701

The same is true the other way, where Java programmers reliant on their IDEs can't imagine working without one, and vice-versa.<p>Used properly, static typing hurts you in some ways (verbosity, certain kinds of inflexibility) but helps you in other ways (static checking, better tools for discoverability and refactoring).  As other people have pointed out, Java itself is also hampered by a lack of a few simple things, like closures and type inference, that could easily be added to the language and that other statically-typed languages have.  The JVM is also hampered by the lack of hotswap to let you make changes to a running system at the very least in development, but even that limitation is being worked on by someone as part of the OpenJDK project (who knows if it'll ever make it to the official JDK, though).<p>There are situations where the tradeoffs are worth it, and situations where they're not.  Anyone declaring the superiority of language X in all situations would do well to really try to talk to people who use other languages and understand their strengths and weaknesses instead of just dismissing them as relics of the past or slave laborers.",1254438186

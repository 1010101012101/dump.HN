3657266,comment,3655137,3656558,4,0,lambda,,,"> In that sense I think the scary bit isn't that he accessed the 8 accounts, it is the fact that he identified them in the first place.<p>This isn't all that surprising. There are basically two reasons why you would have a Bitcoin wallet on a server: if you are mining using the CPU power of that machine, or if you need to send Bitcoins from an online application. For example, one of the people who mentioned having coins stolen was from a mining pool; you need some automated system to pay out the earnings to the people who have been doing mining, and so the wallet for that automated system was on the server, and was stolen. I suppose one further reason might be as a backup, but in that case, I dearly hope that it's an encrypted backup without the encryption keys in the sever.<p>Given these reasons for having your wallet on the server, it's not surprising that people found them. These require network-facing services, that are easy to trace back to the server in question. The mining pool is a public service; anyone can join, and find the address of the server. Furthermore, when you make payments, you announce them to the full Bitcoin network. Someone sniffing transactions can watch where transactions originate, and target that. If they already had a compromised customer service account on Linode, they probably watched the Bitcoin network for a while, made note of transactions originating from IP addresses in the Linode range, and then targeted those accounts.<p>One way to protect yourself from this would be to proxy your Bitcoin transactions through a host other than the one that has the wallet, obfuscating where the transactions are actually coming from. You could even go so far as to make all of your transactions via Tor, which would probably make it fairly difficult to find where your Bitcoin wallet actually lives.<p>> Perhaps a better approach is to keep a BitCoin wallet encrypted, since that's pretty simple to do in day-to-day life. This is something that you can't do with your wallet -- you cannot turn your wallet into a steel vault with two-foot-thick walls.<p>The problem is, if you need to make payouts from your wallet, then the machine that does that needs to be able to decrypt the wallet. That machine can then be compromised to be able to steal your keys. Encryption doesn't buy you all that much, unless you are just doing a backup and don't need the machine to be able to do online transactions at all.<p>Perhaps another solution would be to encrypt each key in your wallet separately using a k-out-of-n encryption scheme (where produce n keys, any k of which can decrypt the wallet). You can then distribute those keys to independent hosts, which hopefully should not all be subject to the same vulnerabilities. Then any time you do a transaction, k of those hosts will need to produce their key to decrypt the key in your wallet and perform the transaction. That way you would have to compromise several different, independent hosts in order to steal the wallet.<p>Of course, this would drastically increase the cost and complexity of the system; and you would need to ensure that whatever system that authorized payments was likewise distributed, which if you had, say, a web-facing service would be difficult.<p>The easiest thing to do to reduce the risk is to only leave enough value in the wallets that are on the servers for a couple days worth of transactions. Then you transfer Bitcoins from a more secure location once a day to keep the coffers full. This is not much different than a physical store; yes, you are at risk of being robbed, but if you only have one days worth of cash there, with the rest somewhere more secure, you reduce how much risk you have.",1330707267

3657252,comment,3655355,3655988,6,0,noduerme,,,"+1. The real issues here are that the coins were all stored in a hot wallet, and that wallet was on a VPS. For some bizarre reason people have started to act like having a VPS is as good as running a dedicated box with a backup power supply and physical (cage) security. A VPS is just a big shared server dolled up with OS partitions. There's no reason to assume that a the provider doesn't have non-physical root access to all the accounts, or that a single compromised account can't escalate via god-knows what kinds of buffer overflows or other exploits into gaining control of the whole machine.<p>I run a Bitcoin site that keeps a very small percentage profit out of a relatively large amount of coins in and out, which have to be held in trust for customers. Not only is our bitcoin daemon not running on our webservers (it's got its own dedicated box with all unnecessary ports closed and a vicious denyhosts policy that's locked me out more than once), we also set up low limits to immediate withdrawals so that no more is stored in the hot/withdrawals wallet than could be withdrawn immediately by players currently online (usually no more than $250), with all larger withdrawals processed in batches on demand. That lets us offload the excess coins to another wallet as soon as they're deposited, so in the worst-case scenario we might lose a couple hundred bucks. The cold wallet is stored in a truecrypt archive on a thumb drive in my pocket, with an encrypted backup stored on a server in a third country, manually, with each batch transaction. Moreover, a lot of our funds are moved out into USD and held for safekeeping to avoid excess Bitcoin risk.<p>This is why banks keep their money in a safe, not in the little drawers in front of the teller. And no offense to Zhou, but this should have been the obvious step to take from the beginning. Hopefully they'll do it now.",1330707044

I was majorly depressed for over 3 years without realizing it, because on the surface it seemed like I had ""the good life"" (vacationing every 2-3 months, a bunch of friends, great income, etc) but everything I tried was sluggish, I felt demotivated and alone. Only when I checked myself into cognitive therapy did I realize how bad things were upstairs.<p>Over the years I built up all these inaccurate beliefs in myself and others without correcting them and letting them run rampant. I dedicated 2 hours a day in reading and practicing exercises + 1 hr / week cognitive behavioral therapy sessions for about 6 months, and it is by far the best investment I have spent. While they can't fix your problems so that you will never be depressed again, but it definitely helps you realize when you are thinking inaccurately, showing warning signs of depression, and things to help you cope.<p>If you can not afford therapy, then I suggest reading the book recommended by my therapist, ""feeling good"" by david burns.

3657138,comment,3656371,3656371,12,0,krohrbaugh,,,"The author's main point is that Expert's Exchange (EE) was very similar to StackOverflow (SO) <i>until they needed to push up the S-curve</i> from a profitability perspective.<p>It's a valid concern since SO has relied on organic growth to fuel the necessary returns in order to sustain its current business model and then, more recently, attract VC investment.<p>What the author doesn't mention is what makes SO slightly different. One is the licensing of the content, which the founders never fail to point out (and has already been rehashed here by several SO defenders). This is hand-waving, since they couldn't have achieved early success to drive organic growth without this license in place (this isn't the first time EE has been compared to SO).<p>The other more interesting difference is the StackExchange (SE) platform and accompanying business model, which basically seeks to expand into an unending array of fields and topics. SO & SE are likely to continue being pleasant to use, as long as the StackExchange strategy is working and growth can come from the platform extension. Should that strategy fail, SO will need a growth strategy that provides the returns VCs expect and the company may be forced into some inconvenient (to users) ""monetization"" decisions.<p>Essentially, when you're a for-profit company, it's easy to ""do no evil"" when you're rapidly growing organically. EE is only one such example, it's easy to come up with dozens of others: About.com, Mahalo, Digg, SourceForge, Google, Ben & Jerry's, etc. Unless it's a non-profit or maybe one of those new B-Corps, history provides much more support for skeptics. After all, company leaders aren't just acting out of greed, they are <i>legally obligated</i> to do what is best for shareholders.<p>That said, let's hope Mr. Spolsky hasn't forgotten about his rant on platform providers who don't realize they are platform providers (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Platforms.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Platforms.html</a>). He should be able to make the case that treating users (which are like developers in a traditional software platform) fairly will drive more long-term shareholder value than tactics employed by those that came before SO.<p>Only time will tell.",1330705606

The only attacker you would be able to thwart with more encryption would be the one who is able to root a linnode VPS, but unable to extract the key or decrypted wallet from from software <i>running on that box</i>.  Sure, there is probably some number of attackers in that space, but security is a game of diminishing returns, and there are different security measures to take that are a much better investment of time than stopping that small slice of people.",1330705094

The reason you pay so much at a bank for a tiny box, where as, space wise, you pay a fraction for your appartment, or essentially change for a  storage locker, is that the bank expects you to put valualbles in that space and so pays lots of that money to inssurance so if they do get robbed, they are covered and can pay you.  The other places... dont.  And usually have clauses in their contract saying as much: ""We aren't insured for valueables, so don't store them here, it may not be safe and we won't (and can't) pay you back if they get stolen.<p>Linode falls into the second category, cheap, uninsurred storage space.

IOW, if you ran a simulation of the earth over and over again, the timelines might be skewed, but we would eventually end up in the same place.  Every advancement, whether it be inventions or discoveries about the physical universe, push the human race forward.  But it always has to happen in such a way that it's two steps forward, one step back.  If there's a hole or weakness in a system there is an opportunity to exploit it and you better believe it will be done.  That's a good thing as it makes the system stronger; the sooner the better.<p>As was mentioned before on HN the wonderful BBC documentary ""The Century of The Self"" delves into how the 20th century US democracy began controlling by pandering to consumerism/irrationalism (ie. the tie between big business/media and government), while our communist adversaries began governing by increasingly abject force. They're like two sides of the same coin.  Is it bad/evil or did this need to happen? Think about what's happened in that timeframe... the automobile, airplane, radio, the depression, nuclear energy/weapons, two world wars, the computer, television, the personal computer, the internet, and everything the internet is beginning to mobilize.  The change to the world in one century is absolutely mesmerizing.<p>I believe through globalisation these two sides are both merging and dissolving at the same time - that's not necessarily a bad thing, it's the world trying to work out inefficiencies in these respective systems; inefficiencies which could be seen as bugs in a system that invite corruption.  When bugs are exposed and fixes begin to emerge, the pockets of corruption are going to fight back - as they should, because that's their livelihood at stake.<p>Information is more free than ever, and that is what truly sets us free.  So they made this mistake.  And it's been exposed, quickly.  Think about all the nefarious things that happened in the cold war that took decades to come to light. Think about what happened in the Middle East last year; governments toppled, quickly.  They tried to sneak SOPA under the public radar and look what happened.",1330705040

I'm not sure, especially when it comes to the tablets.<p>There are the obvious reasons for phones:<p>- Alice doesn't like Apple devices (whether those reasons are valid or prejudice doesn't matter). Phones <i>are</i> as much about personal preference as technical quality.<p>- Bob doesn't want to change carriers, and the only smartphones his carrier has are Android devices.<p>- Charlie just wants a phone and wants the cheapest device available. Until the 3GS was made available for $0 on contract, iPhones <i>always</i> cost more than $0 up front.<p>- Denise wants the cheapest phone off-contract. This is usually going to be an Android device.<p>- Eric is a specs junkie and buys things based on specs. He has to have the fastest, biggest, most capacious thing.<p>- Fran has been convinced over the years that specs matter, but she doesn't have the technical knowledge to be able to tell the difference between specs that matter and specs that don't. She's also the one who will buy a 15 megapixel pocket camera because she's been told time and again that megapixels matter.<p>- Gene genuinely prefers products by {HTC,Samsung,Motorola}. See the discussion about Alice.<p>- Harriet goes into the store and asks the salesperson what she should buy. The salesperson (Ian) directs her to his choice in phone—which might be based on the vig he gets, not on any particular benefit of the phone to the consumer. Ian may also have any of the reasons noted above, or he might listen to the customer's needs.<p>For tablets, the carriers don't matter. Price might matter, but most Android devices aren't doing so well on the matter of price: the top tier tablets are as much or more than the iPad, and the bottom tier Android tablets tend to be crap. The only exceptions to the bottom tier ""tending to be crap"" appear to be the Kindle Fire, Kobo Vox, and B&N Nook—and those aren't counted as ""real"" Android tablets in any case.<p>Personally, I'd only recommend an Android phone if there weren't any iPhones or WP7 phones on a person's carrier—and I'd seriously suggest changing carriers if they could reasonably do so. I can't think of a single reason that I'd <i>ever</i> recommend an Android tablet (or a Playbook) other than <i>possibly</i> the Vox, Fire, or Nook (and even there I'd make sure that the user really wanted a tablet and not just a reader, in which case I'd recommend an eink version).

Or was there a vulnerability in the admin interface that allowed someone to sniff credentials? Or did they hack into the personal computer of someone with admin privileges?<p>Basically, this announcement gives me no confidence that they've done due diligence in fixing this problem. They haven't explained what the vulnerability actually was, nor what they have done to avoid it in the future.<p>Of course, this does speak to the dangers of using hosted services for anything that needs a high level of security. Anyone with appropriate admin privileges on the host system can compromise any user. That increases the attack area considerably; you don't need to attack the system directly, nor the users of the system in question, you just need to find one person who has admin privileges who is vulnerable, steal their credentials, then attack any users at your leisure.",1330704143

In this case, however, I think we're dealing with the sometimes hard to distinguish ""spouting nonsense"" tool. :-)<p>After a certain price point (say 10,000 for CAD packages and the like, where you're actually paying for some seriously specialized and advanced software) it's no longer about the software, it's about the customization. <i>That's</i> what those overpriced sales people come to talk to you about. Not only that, but once they're done you'll get and army of project managers and senior devs that come to visit you to figure out exactly what it is you need and by the time these people are done and all their salaries are paid, yes, you'll have paid somewhere upwards of 75,000 dollars but it's not a piece of software you've bought, it's custom development tailoring a specific package to your exact (hopefully) needs.",1330704138

I read the article and one analogy quickly came to my mind. EE was like AltaVista/Lycos/Infoseek, and Stack Overflow is like the younger version of Google.<p>+ The latter is clearly superior in technology (or content) to the other.<p>+ The latter makes user happy by giving them real value, whereas the former focused on milking the users for revenue.<p>+ The latter made promises to the users (Google: ""don't be evil"", SO: ""contents are the community's property"") and the users liked it.<p>+ Last but not least, ""the competition is only a click away"" (Google). ""You can start a SO competitor in a heartbeat"" (SO).<p>So far so good. But guess what happened to Google? They got good. They got big. They were no longer satisifed with being the king of search. They started Plus. They started saying ""If you don't want people to know what you do, you shouldn't do that anyway"". They now want your data to be shared among their properties and you cannot opt out. They got jealous of Apple. They got freaked out by Facebook.<p>I don't doubt Google started with a conscience, and a genuine focus to build a better search engine. They succeeded. Wildly. But except for the most hard-core Google believers, I doubt that many people still trust their ""Don't be evil"" mantra in its absolute. Frankly, do people even say that with a straight face outside of comparison with Microsoft?<p>I love SO and believe in the integrity of Joel and Jeff and others. You guys really rock. But time will change. Tide will change. A tidepool that is fun for little kids could become a fatal trap the very next day (sadly, this happens often). So please keep the warning in mind.",1330704125

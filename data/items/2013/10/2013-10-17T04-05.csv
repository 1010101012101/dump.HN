6563725,comment,6562132,6562562,1,0,malandrew,,,"What we currently have is a market with the illusion of honesty. That&#x27;s what insider trading laws are there to provide. It&#x27;s not real trust between counter-parties in a market. Eliminating insider trading laws wouldn&#x27;t change much, just lift that veil. If everyone participating in the market knows that people can be operating at a significant and privileged informational advantage, they will just take that into account when researching the market and executing their trading strategy. They won&#x27;t stop trading, just trade differently.<p>It is likely that the repeal of insider trading laws would prompt a greater investment in discovering insider information and making that information known to the market faster. Firms that do nothing but specialize in getting insider information would crop up. Those in the know would eventually have to assume that their counter-parties may have the same information perhaps through the same information contact or through different ones that have the same info.<p>If you really play through the scenario of removing the restriction posed by insider trading laws, you&#x27;ll see that things aren&#x27;t really better or worse in terms of the greater good. Without insider trading laws, there is no victim since the victim knows they are playing a different game. The laws themselves are responsible for permitting victimization to occur in the first place since it implies the expectation of trust where there often isn&#x27;t any.",1381985185

As such it didn&#x27;t feel like it was advancing the project.  It was never meant as any slight towards IE, just an expedient way to save some time.<p>Also, while we do browser sniffing, we only use that to put up a warning for IE users to alert them that it&#x27;s not going to work well.  This was pointed out on Twitter as though we were actively blocking browsers, in part I think a knee-jerk reaction to browser sniffing, but what we&#x27;ve done still seems to me like a reasonable and responsible thing to do  better to admit you don&#x27;t support a browser than just expose people to a crappy experience.<p>Of course times change, and as TogetherJS has become a more mature tool it&#x27;s probably time to revisit our Internet Explorer support.  But on the other hand this isn&#x27;t a commercial tool, so I&#x27;m not entirely sure what resources we as a team will be able to invest in Internet Explorer support.  But it&#x27;s also open source, and we would welcome contributions to fix this.  We&#x27;ll be working on a slightly more structured plan soon.  It might not even be much work, I really don&#x27;t know.<p>Here&#x27;s the bug to watch: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/togetherjs/issues/867"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/togetherjs/issues/867</a>",1381984346
6563687,comment,6560085,6560085,1,0,graycat,,,"Snow&#x27;s <i>Two Cultures</i> was something I loudly cheered
when I first read about its points and for years
afterward.<p>But now the book and the OP strike me as not well
considered.<p>Net, the &#x27;humanities&#x27; have a role much more
important than is commonly or easily described.  It
took me a while to understand this point.<p>Sure, as an insecure a young nerd facing the world,
both nature and society, I wanted &#x27;control&#x27; of my
life, in particular, &#x27;security&#x27;, and for those
wanted the power of &#x27;truth&#x27; and didn&#x27;t want to
settle for anything less solid than, say, plane
geometry or, in a pinch, mathematical physics.  Of
course then only some of this could I articulate.<p>So, something like &#x27;The Song of Hiawatha&#x27; with &quot;By
the shores of Gitche Gumee,  By the shining
Big-Sea-Water ...&quot; seemed to me as mostly nonsense
and gibberish and at best maybe something lightly
entertaining but nothing like the &#x27;truth&#x27; for the
power I was seeking.  And maybe I was correct, but
I&#x27;m reluctant to return to that poem to be more
sure!<p>Eventually I concluded that (1) there is a lot about
the world, where I was trying to get control and
security, that was too complicated and subtle for
mathematics and/or mathematical physics to do me any
good and (2) that part of the world was so important
to my life that, even though I didn&#x27;t have solid
tools to address it, I still had to handle it in
some sense.<p>Maybe &#x27;The Song of Hiawatha&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t help me
handle those complexities, but eventually I
discovered that some parts of the humanities could
to at least a useful extent.<p>Generally my central criticism of the humanities was
that, in strong contrast with mathematics and
mathematical physics, and, really, most of
engineering, technology, medical science, medicine,
and even law, the humanities (1) did not make clear
just what they were claiming was true and (2) for
any claims nearly never provided convincing
evidence.  While these remain valid criticisms,
amazingly in places the humanities can be important
nevertheless.<p>Still, I was often torqued at the humanities:  E.g.,
in, say, the English departments, a common claim was
that English literature had a lot of good knowledge
of people and would help readers understand people.
I concluded, and still do, that <i>maybe a little</i>.<p>Once I discovered the E. Fromm, <i>The Art of Loving</i>,
awash in real practical expertise, well considered
and formulated, about people, I concluded that Fromm
was a good example of progress on information for
understanding people.  For more on love
specifically, actually some of the relevant articles
on Wikipedia seem quite good -- at least in places
they have explained some of what I figured out more
or less independently, at enormous cost, and added a
lot more.<p>So, it is possible to get some understanding of
people, but for this purpose I would mostly set
aside English literature as too thin and/or even
misleading.<p>For understanding people, I&#x27;d say that the most
important contribution of English literature to
understanding people is that some people like English
literature.<p>The crack in my scorn that got me started with the
humanities classical music.  A brilliant person once
said, &quot;Music doesn&#x27;t mean anything.&quot;.  Well, maybe,
maybe not, but it still can be useful for someone
wanting to understand people or even themselves,
amazingly.<p>Classical music was able to &#x27;reach&#x27; me in part
because there were usually few or no words to take
literally and, thus, argue with.<p>Well, it turns out that classical music has
something of a <i>language</i>, especially about human
emotions.  If want to understand people, the biggest
chapter is human emotions.<p>Classical music is an example of a common definition
of <i>art</i> as in <i>the communications, interpretation
of human experience, emotion</i>.  Well, it can be easy
enough to find parts of classical music that are
quite effective meeting this definition of art.  So,
here there is some progress in understanding humans.<p>One description of much of the media is <i>vicarious,
escapist, fantasy, emotional experience
entertainment</i> which sounds next to worthless for
the audience and, maybe, is, but we can reduce this
description to <i>vicarious emotional experience</i> and,
then, learn about people by feeling their emotions
-- and art has a lot of this and, thus, can help a
person understand people.<p>For some value for the audience, good art is
supposed to be <i>universal</i> and, then, often a person
in the audience can see where the art is describing
things much as in their life from which that person
can conclude, &quot;I&#x27;m not the only one who has
encountered such a thing.  That thing is not unique
to me.  Whatever I did to make that thing happen,
others did the same, and maybe some of the main
causes are not really from me.&quot;.<p>E.g., a few weeks ago I did a search for a girl I
knew and fell in love with in high school.  Yup, the
Internet showed me a scan of a high school annual
with her picture as a Homecoming Queen candidate.
To me she was always the prettiest human female I
ever saw in person or otherwise.  Then many of those
days with her, decades ago, came back to me as if
they were last week.  She was my first love and,
apparently, burned into my brain -- I can no more
forget her than I can forget my own name.<p>Well, we were young:  We saw each other for 18
months and started when she was just 12 and in the
seventh grade and I was 14 and in the ninth grade.<p>I was a nerd, socially awkward, and not good at
understanding the emotions of a young woman, and we
were both afraid of rejection.  So we were to afraid
to communicate clearly and accumulated quite a list
of false beliefs about each other that had us making
mistakes in our relationship.  At one point, some of
her mistakes got me to draw some seriously wrong
conclusions, and I walked away from her.  I don&#x27;t
think that there was anything seriously wrong, and
everything wrong was based just on
mis-communications, My heart was broken, and I later
discovered that so was hers.<p>Then there&#x27;s Wagner&#x27;s opera <i>Lohengrin</i>, first
performed in 1850, about a knight, Lohengrin, of the
Holy Grail who marries sweet Elsa.  Yes, the Wagner
&quot;Bridal Chorus&quot; or &quot;Wedding March&quot; music is from
their marriage in that opera.  Elsa is misled by an
evil witch, makes a mistake, and Lohengrin is forced
to walk away from his new bride.<p>So, <i>Lohengrin</i> told me that I was not the first guy
to walk away from the young woman he loved and that
such things go back to at least 1850.<p>Also, Lohengrin and I made similar mistakes:  We
asked too much of the understanding of our women and
should have had arranged a less &#x27;brittle&#x27; situation.<p>Nerd guys:  Listen up here and learn.<p>As good art communicates emotions about the human
experience, members of the audience can begin to
learn more about other people.<p>The best art, in the humanities, can be astoundingly
effective in communicating about humans; we don&#x27;t
want to be without the results; and technical fields
are so far no substitutes.<p>Took me a while to see these points.",1381984319

The latter is important so that when you work in different locations, you don&#x27;t have to recalibrate your expectations.

We risk very little, yet enjoy a position over those who offer up their work and their selves to our judgment. We thrive on negative criticism, which is fun to write and to read.<p>It&#x27;s not as easy at it seems. A critic needs to have experience, knowledge, and a certain eloquence in order to have any kind of power or influence. And a critic does take risks every time he writes a piece. Should he write something bad, he may lose his reputation and his following.  A critic has to be consistent over time as well - one cannot say A and then B about the same time 2 years later. It&#x27;s more challenging that it seems, and that is probably because this line was written by a movie script writer who does not like critics.",1381983516

You can be sure that they paid enough in premiums for the insurance companies to make a profit on them (on average) after paying for their medical expenses, since insurance companies are for-profit businesses that don&#x27;t like to lose money.<p>The fact that they were only paying their own way and not subsidizing someone else&#x27;s insurance rates by overpaying for their own coverage doesn&#x27;t sound like a &quot;free ride&quot; to me.<p>Consider car insurance: Should middle-aged drivers with clean driving records (who pay the lowest rates) pay higher rates so that teenagers, who get into more accidents, can have more affordable rates? Or should the rates be proportional to the amount the insurance company has to pay out for a particular group of drivers? If &quot;health insurance&quot; is really insurance against a predictable set of risks, why should it be different from auto insurance?",1381983291

The only issues I had were the prongs which provide the back skeletal strength broke through the mesh. As the meshing is plastic this meant a sharp pain in one&#x27;s shoulder blade. The warranty covered the fix and paid for  fedex to came to my house with a giant box and ship it for repair. I cannot imagine what it must have cost to ship a full sized chair! Even still I was out a nice chair for a couple weeks. Those few weeks reminded me how much nicer the Mirra was compared to my old staples chair.<p>This redesign appears to address said structural weakness by spreading the point of contact.  It also widens the usage space for positioning your back. In my Mirra 1.0 your body must be dead center else your back will be sitting over a pointy prong. It looks like this 2.0 will have a backing which folds into your back, hugging it so to say.<p>It also appears they have slimmed the box below the seat. In general the plastic casings are slimmer and less bulky. Also of note it appears the adjustable lip where your knee joints occur has been given a longer radius of rotation. Or atleast it looks longer to compared to my Mirra.",1381983103

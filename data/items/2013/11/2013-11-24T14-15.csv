You said you don&#x27;t really know what happens server-side and this may get in your way. A framework is often designed to address specific problems/needs in a specific context.<p>These problems/needs don&#x27;t have to be shared by anyone else, it could just be you thinking &quot;It&#x27;s hard to build RESTful urls, I should build something to do it for me&quot; and have a CLI util or a script handler that would register them for you in your app server. And some can be everyday problems: &quot;F*ckin&#x27; databases, how do they work?&quot;[1].<p>However, you need to know these problems to address them. Which is a part of my long-term feud with frameworks: &quot;If you always use a framework, you will never have (too much) problems and will never learn how to solve them&quot; (writing my own active-record-like ORM for node.js is a lot of fun actually).<p>Which is why my advice to you is: Don&#x27;t write a framework.<p>Instead, write an app, get stuck a lot of times and find a way. Identify your problems. Then write a different app. This time, look at what you are doing the same way, what problems you are solving another way and what you&#x27;d like your framework to automate. There, for this second app, you can start writing your framework because you&#x27;ll have a better idea of what you need to address.<p>You don&#x27;t really need to make a framework that caters to everyone&#x27;s needs, but one that caters to your needs and expand from there.<p>Next (optional) step is rewriting the first app with the second app&#x27;s framework and iterate new functionalities.<p>1: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs</a>",1385304712

A lot of people thought that acid was pretty interesting but it took some Spanish dudes to reduce the acid to a completely worthless metal.  Then two centuries later one American dude came up with a way of purification and heat treatment such that it finally made a decent wire for electric light bulb (no, not the guy you&#x27;re thinking of, a plant scale engineer decades after the inventor) and then General Electric (at that time an American company unlike now) tried to patent the whole process.

He didn&#x27;t find he&#x27;s dangerous, he found out his brain is lacking in capacity for &quot;empathy, morality and self-control&quot; (which is what he self-observed in the first place).

Two things come to mind after reading the comments posted earlier here.<p>1) Most people who have read about genetic influences on human behavior have not read the masters, but rather their disciples. The masters of behavior genetics research take care to write about the concept of &quot;reaction range,&quot; the variety of possible behavior patterns that MIGHT arise from an individual with a given genotype under differing environmental influences. It is apparent that the reaction range for many human behaviors is very broad even if genotype is fixed.[1]<p>2) Simply adding some brain-scan data to some hypothesis pulled out of a hat will make even the most wild and crazy hypothesis more plausible to lay readers. Neuroscience is hard, and so far there are not a lot of neuroscience conclusions about human behavior that are well replicated and well backed up by theory.[2]<p>[1] The review article Johnson, W.

And the same genes may produce very different IQs and heights against different genetic backgrounds and in different environmental circumstances. This would be especially the case if height and GCA and other psychological traits are only single facets of multifaceted traits actually under more systematic genetic regulation, such as overall body size and balance between processing capacity and stimulus reactivity. Genetic influences on individual differences in psychological characteristics are real and important but are unlikely to be straightforward and deterministic.

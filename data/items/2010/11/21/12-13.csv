1926984,comment,1925744,1926939,0,0,syllogism,,,"I should really have been more precise with the question. I meant that governments provide functional services in many countries, without the cost-spirals described in the parent. To me government is just, ""we'll get you out of the prisoner's dilemma by providing a framework for forced cooperation, but we'll also misalign incentives in a way that introduces some inefficiencies"". In many countries, this trade-off is often good value --- but in the US, something always seems to go wrong. That's what I didn't understand.<p>For instance, in my country, Australia, our government provides interest-at-inflation loans to all students for undergraduate degrees. The loans are repaid via income tax, and repayments only begin once your income exceeds a certain threshold. Almost nobody defaults, since the payments are just subtracted from your paycheque before it even gets to you, just like your income tax. At the same time the repayments are calculated to never be too onerous, and you're only ever paying the principle. I don't know what stops universities from inflating their fees --- presumably the government has guidelines for costs of courses eligible for these loans. A typical 3 year arts degree might cost about $30k. The good universities are about on par with the good US state schools in rankings. We don't have any universities equivalent in quality to the top tier US schools. I believe this is a sane and sustainable system. Our single payer health care system isn't perfect, but it's a lot better than the USA's system.<p>It's possible that it does come down to the subtleties of our electoral systems. It seems a little unintuitive to me, since folks here do mostly make their choice between the two major parties and pull for whichever they like. On the other hand we do have single transferable vote for our senate, which always elects some independents who represent their constituents. We also have compulsory voting, so you can't pull any shenanigans to disenfranchise people or discourage them from voting.",1290344275

Thanks Marco!]<p>Marco has recently left his position as the CEO of Tumblr; and I think concentrates on Instapaper much more than ever (I assume it was mostly a weekend project before, requiring simple fixes); therefore I have no doubt he will be making the service more reliable and better in the future (switch to S3 or similar).<p>Also, don't forget that Instapaper web service is currently free, although the iOS applications are not (There is a free lite version too.) There is a recently added subscription option (which AFAIK currently doesn't offer any additional thing); and I hope it will only make the service even better.<p>About security, I do not consider my Instapaper reading list as too confidential; so I don't have much trouble thinking the backup computer being stolen.

Firstly, the D-cache must be cleaned and the I-cache invalidated for the relevant memory addresses.  This is because the CPU does not in general maintain coherency between these caches for performance reasons (writing instructions is rare).  Secondly, memory protection must be set to allow execution of the generated code.

In defense of my readers, they probably glossed over my incorrect definitions, and didn't notice any problem because my calculations didn't match my definition.<p>But I will defend my calculus: dU(AW)/dW = A dU(AW)/dW follows from the chain rule. Another way to do your calculation: d(ln(AW))/dW = A x 1/(AW) = 1/W.<p>Also, the NIT I described has been proposed (that's how it was described in my intro to econ class), and it does not <i>always</i> create an incentive to work. The relevant criteria is A dU(AW)/dW > dU(W)/dW. Since dU(AW)/dW decreases with A, there the marginal utility of work can be negative with respect to NIT.",1290343100

1926943,comment,1925744,1926017,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>In most other developed countries, it is politically straightforward to spend $20,000 a year on coaxing and cajoling a patient into managing their diabetes better in order to prevent them from becoming a $70,000 a year dialysis patient. Needless to say that the benefits to this approach are greater than just a cost saving.</i><p>I agree with your basic points.  But as someone who both is American and has a serious life threatening medical condition, I think there must be some deeper reason for this American quirk.<p>I know that a lot of ""standard wisdom"" concerning nutrition and the like not only doesn't work for me but is actively harmful to me.  I have managed to get off 8 or 9 prescription drugs and now manage my health issues via diet and lifestyle (and herbs and supplements when necessary).  But I have gotten there by following a pig-headed, asinine, ""don't tread on me"" sort of path.  It has been really important to actively reject outside intervention in favor of home-grown solutions for my issue. I suspect something similar may be true for most Americans.  America was founded by social outcasts who left their countries of origins to go elsewhere under really harsh, deadly conditions -- conditions which were, nonetheless, more tolerable than the social expectations they were fleeing.<p>Most people cannot fathom my choice to live without furniture and without a car.  I sleep on the floor and most of the time I own only two or three outfits.  I get lots of comments from people who are often just trying to make conversation but nonetheless are basically butting in to things that they know nothing about and which are none of their business.  For example, I do not own a jacket.  Jackets are too hard to keep adequately clean and most are not designed to be washed regularly (ie every single I wear it).  I find that undershirts work better for me than jackets.  I have also been known to walk to work in flip flops in 40 degree weather.  People inevitably feel compelled to tell me to get a jacket or comment that my feet must be cold or something.  It is usually under circumstances where I do not have the time (even if I had the inclination) to explain to them that whatever annoyance I suffer from the cold is laughable compared to the suffering it has allowed me to walk away from.  It is also usually from people at work, this in spite of a company policy that no one other than my immediate boss is to offer ""constructive feedback"" on my appearance, and then only if I am in violation of dress code.  It annoys me to no end yet I realize that if I made a big stink about it, I would most likely be the one deemed to be 'a problem' (and it would unnecessarily call attention to my medical condition, which I do not wish to do).  Most of these people are well-meaning and genuinely concerned for my welfare and/or just trying to make conversation.  So I try to handle things diplomatically and lightly and good-naturedly, without referencing the serious medical situation that drives my unconventional literally ""remarkable"" (ie worthy of remarking upon by these people) choices.<p>So I think it is possible that most Americans have some deep-seated reason(s) for balking at the idea of someone interceding in their diet and lifestyle choices at an earlier stage in the process.  I know outside interference is one of the things that I feel most threatened by.  Since I don't have a doctor's note for doing what I do, I can't really justify or defend it on some kind of ""legal"" grounds or some such.  I'm just some lone nut-case who occasionally makes fantastical claims that most folks find unbelievable -- an issue I work very hard to keep out of my place of employment.<p>It is unfortunate that the results are so expensive.  But I am not entirely convinced that the cajoling and convincing that works in other cultures would necessarily be such a good thing for a society of outcasts who could not conform and chose to face so much hardship in order to start over elsewhere.  For me, conforming -- even in seemingly small matters like wearing a jacket -- leads to enormous suffering and would eventually kill me.  So I just am unable to ""go along to get along"", in spite of internal wiring that makes me want very much to do that.  But I just can't.  Maybe a lot of Americans also just can't, yet are willing to accept intervention at a later stage of more serious crisis because at that point there is nothing to lose and a great deal to gain.",1290341142

The whole world looks very pretty from space.<p>But regardless of your answers, its clear to me that many places have governments that are better at pursuing the their national interest, at least in some areas.<p>Well, one reason is many other countries have proportional representation.  At least when its rationally implemented.  In PR countries, people can actually choose to be represented by someone that agrees with their values.  And if that person or party sells out, that party will lose support or the party members will pick a different candidate next time that will do what they want.<p>In the US, elections are winner-take-all.  So representatives don't have to align their behavior with the beliefs of their supporters; they just have to convince the most people that they are better than the other options.  It becomes a con job.<p>Candidates must tell different things, lie even, to get the most votes or they get no power at all.  An expensive process that candidates in a multi-party system don't really have to do because the people pick their party by their values and the membership of the party know their own people.  They don't have to struggle to get ALL the power or none; they get their share.<p>So what you get in the legislature in PR countries are groups that more closely represent the different groups in society.  Some want more government, some want less.  But in the US system, you just get people who want more power for themselves and have no incentives to stick to any set of values and many dollars given to them to go along with all of the piranhas that abuse our system.<p>And it probably will not change until the system hits a wall where all of the tricks and cheats have been exhausted and we are finally forced to live within our means.",1290340995

Paper would be collected from bottom using standard scanner/paper style paper grabbing, scanned or printed to and placed in Gap Tray. Gap tray and entire top paper stack need lifted and placed back on support layer 1.<p>Pages would probably be upside down of their original unless they were fed back and forth.<p>All the paper would need lifted up, so there would be a limit, unless... a different idea would be the same thing along a horizontal track of papers.<p>I&#x27;m still liking the idea of a scanner shredder. <a href=""http://designforpeople.ca/?p=215"" rel=""nofollow"">http://designforpeople.ca/?p=215</a><p>To extend this stack design make it like an inverted shredder with a 5&quot; shop vac hose connected to the top :P",1376715535

6228205,comment,6228000,6228000,4,0,detharonil,,,"It seems as though a more practical (though perhaps more dust-prone, when empty) design would do this partially upside-down.  Rather than allowing the printer to move downward though the paper, why not load the paper from the top?<p>One could set a full stack atop something similar to his current design using the rollers, and the finished pages could exit through the front in order to prevent them from building up below.  The final roller could simply be removed and a slit added to the front such that the finished paper could exit the printer cleanly.  A solid plastic sheet could then be added to catch the printed paper which folds back atop the body of the printer when it is being transported or simply not in use, perhaps to prevent the aforementioned build-up of dust.<p>This accomplishes Yamamoto&#x27;s goal of removing the paper tray and simplifying as well as shrinking the design while avoiding the dangerous consequences of brushing past the printer while it is atop a high stack of paper.<p>Of course, none of this addresses a central flaw with his design.  Even if two models are produced for Letter and A4 paper, there are still many other sizes in use, and there appears to be no easy way to adjust the sizes of the intake and output areas without the dreaded paper tray.",1376715247

And if you increase the investor pool to millions like in real life, you greatly increase the size of the most spectacular performances.<p>Now imagine that the best performer is a human being instead of a computer model.

Under those conditions... in a sampling of 100 &quot;typical fund managers&quot;, more than half would still produce higher returns than the market.<p>No, because we&#x27;re comparing manager performance with market indices, like the DJIA, both of which include overall market growth.<p>The &quot;average market&quot; is measured by market indices, each of which tries to characterize a typical buy & hold portfolio. Thus, market indices ascend with overall market growth. That&#x27;s what an average manager has to beat.<p>And the WSJ Dartboard Contest, which compares market indices with submitted manager performances, proves that managers cannot beat the market, even if their fees aren&#x27;t included in the tallies.<p>> Under those conditions... in a sampling of 100 &quot;typical fund managers&quot;, more than half would still produce higher returns than the market.<p>No, just half. not more, not less. Both the market indices and the managers would ride the ascending average value of the market as a whole. The only difference would be the theory being tested -- that some managers have special abilities that would give them an edge.<p>> You made an implicit assumption, which I believe is probably correct, that fund managers as a population are an unbiased sampling of the entire market -- ie. that their returns are the same as the market (or worse) -- but provided no evidence to back it up.<p>I keep proving my point with examples like the Dartboard Contest, and people keep ignoring the evidence. Don&#x27;t you understand that submitters to the Dartboard Contest had every incentive to display their best performance -- a success would assure them of fame and wealth. But none of them could do it, over a period of years.",1376713600

I&#x27;m too frugal to buy a 911 but if another guy has socked away two or three million $ (or more) over the course of his tech career, how is this different than a 25yo with a big exit buying a 911?  You seem a bit misinformed about age, a bit of an age-ist perhaps: I&#x27;m healthy and can bench press more now than in my entire weight-lifting life (since about 22).  I agree with you that &quot;kids&quot; (i.e. people 20-30  :-) ) in tech are very often suckered into giving up their young lives to their tech employers.  I saw this happening in the mid-90s at M$ and in their Seattle-area wannabes.  I never participated in that, my time outside of the 9-5 norm was <i>precious</i> to me.  You are right that &quot;no amount of money compensates ever&quot; for those years if they are lost.",1376713529
6228153,comment,6226607,6226607,6,0,roryokane,,,"I like this. Im not as impressed with it as many others seem to be, since Ive worked with Encore and Sibelius a lot and they have almost this exact feature. That is, they play synthesized audio while moving the bar along with the sheet music. But it is nice to have better-played music to listen to while following along with sheet music.<p>I do also sometimes pull up some classical sheet music and try to read it along with a recording. So if you get a bigger library that includes pieces I end up being interested in, your site would be useful in that respect. I would enjoy the safety of having the red bar following along to make sure I dont lose my place.<p>You said on <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6226990"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6226990</a> that the left and right arrow keys should move by page, and not by measure, and theyre just mislabeled. I think it would actually be more helpful for the arrow keys to move by measure. Thats what Im used to in other programs, and I would want to do that more often. I often move back a measure or three back to replay a complicated part I just heard. Moving back a whole page is too much, and using the mouse to click the previous measure is less efficient. You could still keep the keyboard page-moving functions, but bind them to Page Up and Page Down instead.<p>Ive used Transcribe! (<a href=""http://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/overview.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.seventhstring.com/xscribe/overview.html</a>) before to manually mark up the measures and beats of pieces. You say you have some JavaScript tool that helps you mark up pieces, and I would love to see it, but you might also want to look at Transcribe! and see if that makes marking up pieces easier. Transcribe! uses a proprietary file format, but its not too hard to extract the beat times by parsing the text of the file.<p>Another scrolling method you could try to help people keep their place is showing two rows/systems at once. When you get to the end (right side) of one row, move the bar to the left side of the next row, and then scroll the next row up, displaying the row after that below it.

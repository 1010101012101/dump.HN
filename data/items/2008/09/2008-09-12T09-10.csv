I certainly hope this dropbox thingy is actually easy to use as advertised by SO MANY!!!
But seriously, the ONLY thing it can offer is something easier for shared file storage.  Something that's been done many times over...now we get to see if dropbox has done it well enough to attract a long term user base.
But Joel's post is OVER THE TOP in pandering!!!  Does he have equity in this thing?",1221213052

well, it's a bit different than local/my in Perl: variables declared local are dynamically scoped, variables declared my lexically (with block granularity). Given the choice, most of the time the lexically scoped (my) variant wins hands down.<p>With Javascript, it's a choice between lexically scoped and lexically scoped - the only difference is the granularity: <i>var</i> has function level granularity, <i>let</i> has block level granularity. So in many cases it doesn't really matter, I think. At least the benefit of <i>let</i> over <i>var</i> isn't nearly as strong as it was in Perl of <i>my</i> over <i>local</i>.<p>Having said that, there is no particular reason why you shouldn't make <i>let</i> your variable declaration keyword of choice.",1221210803

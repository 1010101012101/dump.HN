On the 4th floor there is a city viewing deck with pool, jacuzzi, sauna, and a health club all with views of the city.  There is a drive in garage with elevators right to your apt.  My apt had a great floor plan on the 9th floor with large modern bay windows and city views - it was the ultimate bachelor pad.  The management was very professional and responsive, and it is one of the best apts I've ever had.",1177761506

17670,comment,17573,17598,0,0,ralph,,,"I asked this question elsewhere too.  Can we have a ""known bugs"" page that has what you consider bugs on there together with whether you intend to fix them or not.<p>I think spam posts being counted is a bug but it isn't clear if you do.  A known bugs page may answer that.  Perhaps it's awkward to fix because you send the HTML containing the count before examining each of the posts, or do you build the whole page before sending anything?",1177760937

You just want peace and quiet, like you used to have, and a constant revenue stream. Not everybody is looking to take over the world. ",1177758927

Everyone else in the EU is pretty much convinced that the UK is just trying to eat the cake and have it.<p>IIRC, the UK has opted out of Schengen and the Euro. That would look OK to me were we not talking of two core EU projects that were supposed to be game changers.<p>Coming from a country that is currently under an European assistance program, I am not myself very fond of the ""Chancellor"", but your opinion seems to be purely based on the hatred for a particular country and simple anglophilia. \nIt's clear that the EU must have common laws. And it's clear that if the EU is supposed to ever become a superpower in the economic and geopolitical sense, a free trade zone will not suffice.<p>Believe me, European laws don't please everyone. e.g. production quotas have seriously harmed economies that were highly reliant on agricultural production.<p>And regarding Greece... well, Greece has played foul from the beginning. Greek authorities have purposefully reported lower than reality deficit figure as early as 1999. Of course the EU failed there too, and I'm convinced that austerity measures are not the best solution for this mess. But saying that Greece is being ""punished"" because it has refused to follow a particular model is a clear exaggeration.",1356655888

4975895,comment,4971196,4973771,2,0,dredmorbius,,,"For whatever reason, swimming picked up a pattern of really long-distance training routines, peaking in the 1970s and early 1980s with 10-12,000 yard/meter days (two workouts).  Cycling had similar trends for a while as well.  Both are activities in which the athlete is supported (swimmers by water, cyclists by the bike) and friction is minimal (rowing tends to get painful after an hour or two), allowing hours-long training sessions well past what would be the point of exhaustion in other activities.<p>While this can help with skills development (though my thinking is that training in an exhausted state reinforces poor form), and may be a good way to keep kids off the streets, it's largely useless for developing maximum capability in the shorter-duration events typical of pool meets (50-500 yards / 50-400 meters), taking anywhere from 15 seconds to 5-6 minutes or so.  The primary exceptions would be 1000m or 1650y events (10-15 minutes or so).  Triathalon / open-water swimming is almost a wholly different sport.<p>You'd benefit in swimming from a regime that's similar to other HIIT training:  15-60 second maximum-effort pieces followed by brief rest (5-15 seconds) and a repeat, in sets of 8-10 or so.  Incorporate warmup, skills drills, and strength training, and workout time drops markedly.<p>I still enjoy doing longer pieces and the whole-body flush accompanying them, but they're not something I undertake daily or even weekly.",1356655692

There's some exception for endurance activities, in which maturity, pacing, training, and nutrition can provide gains until later years (highly competitive 40, 50, and 60-something ultramarathoners aren't uncommon).  And for activities involving fine motor control or finesse, skills may be developed over a lifetime, though injuries can also accumulate:  gymnasts, dancers, and football players often peak out young.<p>For strength sports, progress is cumulative over years, meaning peak strength may not occur until the mid 30s or early 40s.<p>In competitive sports, you're looking at a mix of skills and abilities.  Individual progress is harder to measure as it's team results that are most evident, not that stats aren't available (how meaningful they are is another matter).  High-contact sports tend to be games of youth, but this isn't always the case.<p>And for anyone, coming to an activity fresh means a lot of latent potential to unleash:  you'll likely improve dramatically over the first few years of participation.",1356654978

You won't find anything worthwhile in the Rails world to tout over Django, since there probably exists an equivalent (or if not a port is soon to appear).  Likewise, this works the other way around.<p>What makes me personally prefer Django is the approach the developers take, which when compared to Rails is more conservative.  If something is to change in Django, the old way generally gets marked as deprecated a few version prior, and changes are introduced to have limited impact.  I mean, even when Django changed the base directory structure of a new project they made sure that old code with the old directory structure would still work in most cases.<p>For the new url template syntax in 1.5 (they changed it to fix an inconsistency with other tags, as well as to support a new use case to allow variables as an argument), a from-future fix was introduced early on (in 1.3 even!) so that people with slow moving projects could safely ignore the problem until they could get around to fixing it, while people with fast moving projects can adopt the new ""correct"" behavior early.<p>Not to say incremental upgrades are always painless, but the pain is limited and well documented.  Things that can be introduced on the users schedule (like the new url template syntax), are.<p>In some ways, that could end up being a disservice.  Django can't move as fast or change as much as Rails can.  But really, that's what you signed up for.  If you bought into Rails and now you're mad that the floor is moving, you really should've considered that in the first place.  Likewise, if you bought into Django and you wonder why it doesn't have ZOMG coffeescript (or whatever) as a default, then you probably should have considered that.  Personally, I'm okay with Django core moving slowly, because I can augment it with reusable apps that are able to move a lot more quickly.<p>You also don't see douchey posts from the Django developers. They generally show respect for competing frameworks, and aren't afraid to be critical of their own.  There's a lot to like here.",1356653766

If it's another legal theory let me know.<p>> Just stop digging.<p>What is it about my comments that is so beyond the pale to you?",1356653280

4975777,comment,4973923,4975628,5,0,kevingadd,,,"We recently launched a HTML5 port of a console/pc game (<a href=""http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/606067"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/606067</a>) on Newgrounds and it was interesting to compare/contrast with the experiences my friends have had launching their Flash games.<p>There's a huge amount of inertia to overcome - lots of people with old browsers unwilling to upgrade, old computers that simply can't run games, and incredibly broken configurations (whether due to bad browsers, bad plugins or bad drivers) where simple HTML5 audio/rendering can crash the browser or reboot the machine. When we first put it up we got lots of complaints and our average review was closer to 3 stars, despite doing tons of testing up-front; eventually by sorting through the issues one by one we got it to the 4 stars you see now. Despite this, Flash games of comparable quality get higher scores, more views, and more revenue (nobody is willing to pay to show ads in HTML5 games; for Flash games there are entire ad networks).<p>So I guess what I'm saying is that you're mostly right.<p>On the other hand, a few people I know who make a living off flash games have said that sponsorships are fewer and further between now, and that ad revenue is decreasing. I don't know whether this represents an overall decrease in the value of in-game ads, or whether Flash's reach is diminishing.",1356653132

In fact, historically the vast majority of clones have failed to beat the ""original"". You'd think Facebook would've learned this by now. They tried to build a clone in 10 days, just like they tried to build a ""Circles"" thing like Google+ had when it came out, and thought that's all they needed to stop people from joining Google+.

I think the point is that you want the users to start using the application as quickly as possible without being hindered by a walkthrough. On the other hand it is important to teach users to use your application... and constraining yourself to commonly used functionality is dangerous. I find that it works very well to 'show' users by helping them do tasks right away (a walkthrough) instead of 'telling' them how to use the application and then leaving them to remember it (also a walkthrough).",1356652928

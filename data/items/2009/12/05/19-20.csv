978499,comment,977362,977825,0,0,gfodor,,,"One thing I've learned over the years is that there is a certain level of tact one needs to have when talking about other peoples' work. It's very easy for people to be offended when you talk about things they've worked on negatively. As I've matured as a software engineer I've come to realize that no, my code is not a beautiful unique snowflake, and yes, I am probably the dumbest guy in the room.<p>This means that generally I've shifted from the thinking ""this other person's code is shit"" to ""I'm betting there was a reason they did it this way."" As it turns out, there almost always is. With the benefit of hindsight, those reasons can sometimes seem foolish, but that's the thing about hindsight. More often than not though, once I take the time to understand them, the decisions of the original author turn out to be better than my knee-jerk response.<p>When your overall attitude is still in the ""everyone else's code sucks"" mindset it leaks out through your language, and I think that's what is happening here, however slightly. There is no reason to use the word ""failed"" or use the word ""sucks"" when talking about another person's work, particularly when it's work that people are using in production for free and work that is open sourced, like Sinatra or Prototype. Even moreso when you're promoting an iteration of improvements on a platform that benefits from the work and experience of many man-months of volunteers, an iteration that is still not even released yet.",1260042586

978432,comment,977176,978157,0,0,thelonecabbage,,,"Again it's a question of definitions.  Israelis define ""religious"" differently.  About 20-30% of Israelis are what Americans would consider ""religious"", about a 1/3 of that is ""ultra-religious"".<p>The 20% that consider themselves ""secular"", REALY mean secular.  As in, hard-core-athiest.  They eat pork, and it's not a statement, it's just meat. You'd love them.<p>To clarify what lies between let me explain.  In a recent survey some 75% of Israelis claimed to keep some form of kosher.  For the majority of that sample space ""kosher"" meant lobster but no pork.  Both equally unkosher, but there is a stigma attached to pork.  All the same, these same lobster-jews would be very offended if you called them non-religious, they are in their OWN WAY. In American definition they are ""non-practicing"", but not in their own.<p>The ""subsantial-minority"" is a weasel word. But is largely limited to what would be termed ""ultra-religious"", and they are entitled to their opinion, thats a democracy for you. Last I checked, there was a substantial-minority in the US that considered seculars dangerous, their called the religious right.<p>Either way, this has NOTHING to do with startups.<p>Israelis, like anyone else, are complex people.  Up close, Israelis are hard working, an incredible combination of the empathic and the aggressive.  Some are good some are bad, most are a bit of both.<p>And speaking as a religious person, everyone questions their faith, and even more their ""religion"". I don't know anyone who is that simple.

Around that time, I vaguely recall it was considered faster than CL-SQL as an Elephant backend; and I found it far easier to install than CL-SQL. (I recall during CL-SQL's installation, it kept signalling errors for each DB it supported which I hadn't installed. Someone at the office said I was supposed to just keep telling Slime to ignore the errors, prodding the install forward. That actually worked.)<p>Maybe things have changed in the interim?<p>If the OP chooses Clojure, then I'd note that the Java classpath really demands you respect its inflexibility. add-classpath is a second class citizen; I've had JDBC (the Java DB manager) swear up and down that it registered the MySQL driver I loaded via add-classpath. But come time to read from the DB, it only worked when I ensured that the MySQL driver was loaded at the beginning in the normal way. What that implies is that if I want to load a new DB driver, I'd probably have to restart the JVM. (Or do something absurdly tricky, or debug more deeply.)",1260039907

All the blackbox systems end up doing pretty much the same thing and getting low returns.  The markets are simply too dynamic for a pure data and algorithms system to work.

I interviewed with a company that had a technical recruiter who knew technology and I was very impressed by them for that.<p>Also keep in mind, how you run the interview process says volumes about what its like to work in your company.  Taking > 2 weeks between responses shows lack of interest.  Making a person have to ""ask"" for a plane ticket to come to the interview is a big turn off too.  The interview process is a great time to show that you take care of your people and make it easy for them to do their jobs.  Take care of us as candidates and we'll assume you'll take care of us as employees.<p>These are pet peeves.  One other thing... communicate the type of position you're looking at putting the person in before lining up their in-person interviewers.  I've had situations where I interviewed with people who did stuff I found interesting and I felt rapport with them.  Likewise I had one company thought about putting me in a position completely wrong for my skills and the people I interviewed with had nothing in common.

After n iterations, you have |X|^n possible outcomes. But, since lcm(|X|, |Y|) != |X|, |X|^n cannot be divided evenly by |Y| (since its factors are the same). So some outcomes in Y must be more likely than others.<p>(This is not nearly complete, but hopefully it's enough to show how it might be right.)<p>Of course, in practice it is highly unlikely that you will get past more than a couple iterations before determining an outcome.",1227572961

It looks like it should alert ""foo"", but run it and you get an ""intIndex is undefined"" error. Good luck debugging that!<p>The problem is, the javascript rules for continuing lines are that whenever the next character is any of [({+-, the line is assumed to continue. This is generally correct but not always. For comparison, the analogous Python rule is that a line continues either with an explicit \ or when one of [({ has not yet been closed with its pair. The Python rule doesn't lead to any ambiguous cases that I am aware of, because unclosed parentheses would just be invalid syntax.",1227572507

My responses weren&#x27;t directed to that statement, but to the more specific enumerated critiques.  In any event, &quot;X is seen as politically impossible&quot; shouldn&#x27;t become &quot;never ask for X&quot;, or X will never be seen as politically possible because no one is asking for it.<p><i>&#x27;Recognizing foreigners as having &quot;rights&quot; that constrain the security-related operations of the NSA would be a political non-starter.&#x27;</i><p>I think that&#x27;s something we should fix (and I think doing so would be in our long-term interest on several fronts, including security).

The call is for him to 1) say that it&#x27;s bad, and 2) to take steps to curtail it.<p><i>&quot;He also can&#x27;t, practically, tell the DOJ not to rely on it.  U.S. v.

The parents who support this have ideological agendas. If these institutions didn&#x27;t exist, they would stick to homeschooling, as many of them already do.<p>It&#x27;s a shame, too.

All it says is that my conscious awareness of some other part of my brain making the decision is delayed by x milliseconds i.e. we are not making decisions in the upper layers of consciousness, but below it.<p>When you think about it, it is what I would expect. Your awareness is the product of nerves firing, so they have to fire before it can be reflected in your consciousness. If you decide to recall some information, the neurons storing that information have to be activated (they have to fire). If you can create a device (and we have) to detect those nerves as they are firing you will know what person is trying to recall before (by some miniscule lead time) they are aware of it.",1389887879

Can be &quot;flattened&quot; when nested two layers deep.<p>For example, an ordered list is a monad, because:<p>1. You can map a function over a list.\n2. Given a value <i>x</i>, you can construct the list <i>[x]</i>.\n3. Given a list like <i>[[1,3], [2], [], [4,5]]</i>, you can flatten it to be <i>[1,3,2,4,5]</i>.<p>There are a couple of other technical constraints, mostly related to what happens when you (for example) take a list, stick into another list using rule (2), and flatten it using rule (3), in which case you&#x27;re supposed to get back the original list. That sort of thing.<p>Monads are useful, and they appear everywhere—quite a lot of generic types support &quot;map&quot; and &quot;flatten&quot;. Haskell obscures this simple structure in two unfortunate ways: (a) the first monad that everybody sees is IO, which is a freakish outlier, and (b) Haskell uses an equivalent formation of monads based on a function &quot;bind&quot;, which is essentially a map (to a doubly nested type) followed by a flatten.<p>Another way to look at monads is as &quot;generalized list comprehensions&quot; where &quot;list&quot; can be replaced with hundreds of different clever things. It&#x27;s a clever little pattern that turns up everywhere, and when it does turn up, it tends to be a sweet spot in the design space.

But Facebook does image recognition, it does ad placement, it does graph networks, it has EdgeRank - Facebook is only possible via math. Sure, perhaps there is more code written to push bits around on the front end and such, but it lives and dies by math. But even screen layout requires math - dealing with resizing screens, different ad and post sizes and so on - there&#x27;s a lot of admittedly basic algebra there.<p>With that said, I agree with much of the content of the post. I run into far too many engineers with no real skill at writing or communication, and that is also a large hindrance in the field. Naturally, every job will require a different balance of skills, and no absolute statement is possible.<p>However, I would say now more than ever math is required to really excel. Write the front end to some CRUD app? Sure, you can do that (where &quot;you&quot; is somebody with no experience). Write a side scroller? Maybe, just maybe you can pull that off. But that awesome new job writing a game that involves game physics. No, you can&#x27;t do that. Hey, we need some image processing on this app. No, you can&#x27;t do that. Let&#x27;s track some objects. No, you can&#x27;t do that. How about schedule some jobs in the factory? No, you can&#x27;t do that. Hey, we have this product idea where we will use an arduino to... no, you wouldn&#x27;t understand PID controls, you can&#x27;t do that. Sigh. Want to write your 1023rd CRUD app? Slap some javascript together? Sure, you can do that.<p>This is why when the topic of university (should I go) comes up I am always a proponent. I was taught to write, I was taught to balance books and run a business, I learned calculus, linear algebra, AI, numerical methods, EE, mechanical engineering, thermodynamics, physics, statistics, chemistry. I&#x27;ve used <i>all</i> of that in my career (this week at work I am implementing some Kalman filters, for example), and my only regret is that I didn&#x27;t take more math courses. The valley is on fire now with jobs requiring math - machine learning, hardware interfaces, augmented reality, and so on.<p>If I had a friend with no real math and an interest in programming I would not dissuade them, but math is very important in an important subset of programming.<p>Finally, I have to say I&#x27;ve watched a lot of people struggle to put a program together which has nested if statements or multiple and/or conditions. Generally speaking, the people that struggle to do it don&#x27;t have any math skills.

Escalation of commitment can be ugly enough as it applies to individuals and small groups; do you really want to see its effect on the national scale?<p>That said, you&#x27;re not quite right to say &quot;it doesn&#x27;t do anything&quot;. Political activism, as it is currently conceived and undertaken in the United States, serves a useful social purpose as an in-group/out-group marker, and I gather that, given sufficient youth and sex appeal, it can be an excellent means of finding pleasant and willing bedmates. Either by itself would suffice as a reason for the young and energetic to involve themselves in what goes by the name of activism; both together make such involvement nigh irresistible.",1389886902

I didn&#x27;t even ask for name brand clothing or toys because 1) I knew we couldn&#x27;t afford them, and it would put stress on them, and 2) years of life in this environment made me not care about such frivolities. Kids aren&#x27;t stupid, they learn proper spending behavior by what they see. I saw my parents buy bare necessities and working hard jobs. Naturally, I learned a hard work ethic and proper spending habits (barring a few years of excess in college when I started making actual money and felt it should be spent).<p>Right now we make good money (gotta love computing), and because of my habits the money fight is nonexistent in our family. If anything, I find myself constantly fighting to buy our kids less crap. I saw both kinds of kids growing up, and it&#x27;s a really interesting thing to see how they are now as thirty-somethings. Many of the kids like me are in my boat now - even those who don&#x27;t have education and professional jobs. Kids who got everything are now suffering in the current economy. It&#x27;s a stark and obvious difference, at least where I&#x27;m originally from.<p>It&#x27;s a nice life this way. I like getting a bunch of money for Christmas, and splurging on a tea mug and a set of digital calipers. Everything else is invested in the hope of early retirement.

We wrote everything out, calculated it, pretended to invest it into things like real estate etc.<p>When I was younger I used the money I saved up, around $15,000, to buy the shack outside our house. My first &quot;investment&quot;. Rules were it was completely mine and my parents couldn&#x27;t touch it. Insulated, spacious, my own little lofty apartment type. It was great, during high school I basically turned it into a smoke shack.<p>I kept it until college, at which point my dad pulled out the original $15k I gave him for it and used it for my college fund and said &quot;you now know how to value money&quot;. He wasn&#x27;t a man of many words, so when he says something like that it really means a lot.<p>I was taught this from a super young age, I didn&#x27;t even bother to beg or throw a fit about anything because I knew my dad would just stare at me until it was over, and if I didn&#x27;t have the cash, I didn&#x27;t get the cookies.",1389885488

There was so much effort tied to it that, even as a child, it struck me that I was trading all of this time and effort for this one product.

It may segfault, or it may\n    access some other contents in memory. That&#x27;s what any C\n    programmer would probably expect.\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that defining OOB array access this way means throwing out pretty much every semantic guarantee from the rest of the language. There is really no friendly way to define writing an arbitrary value to an arbitrary location. By way of example, pretty much every (non-embedded) C implementation since 1972 supports recursion by writing an address of code to execute to memory. If you have semantics allowing a programmer to write to that location, then you can start executing literally any piece of code you want to. On some platforms like x86 you can execute starting in the middle of an instruction.<p>For example, &quot;return&quot; would stop meaning &quot;execution resumes at the callsite of this function&quot; and instead mean &quot;execution resumes at the callsite of this function or maybe somewhere else if someone wrote to arr[-5]&quot;. The article makes a big point about the controversy of giving memcpy() the semantics of memmove(); how would you like the semantics &quot;memmove() unless a concurrent thread is running, in which case anything might be written to dest and src might be overwritten.&quot;",1450925806

Main themes include life extension and surveillance.<p>= Mar =<p>The HitchHiker’s Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams 4<p>The Restaurant at the End of the Universe - Douglas Adams 3<p>Had never read this series, thought it might be about time.<p>= Apr =<p>What does it all Mean? - Thomas Nagel 2 (though it is kind of meant for people who have never done any Philosophy, ever, so would recommend to someone like that. Will pass it on to someone taking an interest in the subject)<p>An introduction to Philosophy.<p>Earth - David Brin 5+<p>Science fiction set in the not too distant future, written in the 90s. Really interesting themes / vision of post climate change world.<p>SlaughterHouse Five - Kurt Vonnegut 5<p>Semi autobiographical account of the bombing of Dresden in WW2. Really funny and clever ideas. Very good.<p>= May =<p>Nick Cohen - What’s Left? 4<p>Account of how the left has degenerated since the collapse of the hard left and the winning of liberal battles e.g. LGBT rights.

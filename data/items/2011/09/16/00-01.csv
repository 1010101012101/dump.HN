The battle I'm picking is to get a compiler on production.<p>In SUSE dev and stage started as clones and production is very close to dev/stage but built by a different group; but in solaris land things are more divergent between dev stage and production because the openCSW packages were all installed on different days from the main public repository which is consistently being updated.  Plus, since -dev is shared with ~30 developers and stage is shared with about ~10 developers and folks ask the dev/stage admins for different packages things start to diverge more as dependencies get upgraded.<p>Where I have problems is trying to compile things like GD and openquicktime that are used by some legacy processes that seem to be very sensitive to certain libraries being at the right version -- maybe this is not going to be an issue on SLES but I've been bitten in the past so many times by subtle library version issues and I find I have the best luck if I always rebuild my entire stack after any OS update or package changes.<p>I know it was another age (when in one day I might have to work on old SunOS, new Solaris, HP/UX, AIX, BSDi, and IRIX boxes -- and dev and stage machines were unheard of), but the grey beards (these dudes literally had awesome grey beards) I learned this trick from had a lot of experience and I still believe that building locally is the best bet unless you can guarantee the systems are identical in every detail (which I will never be able to do because I'm not a sysadmin anymore).<p>> If that's not possible and all the prod machines run the same image I'd build a package on one prod machine and install that on all of them.<p>I will only have one production vm for my app.  The main application I run has ~6k unique visitors a day and ~130k unique visitors a month with an average of 4 pages per visit -- not super high load so I don't need multiple back end servers -- at least on my shared solaris host.  I haven't done load testing on the vms yet -- but if I do need multiple production vms they will be able to clone the vms for me in production.",1316134005

The DVD side in having to deal with the USPS crisis and the streaming sides lack of good content while having to pay too much to fix it.<p>The postal service is itself trying to shut down Saturday delivery and night delivery. My dad is a postal worker. Him and most of his fellow coworkers do not have a problem with this change. They know the service is in trouble so they are willing to make compromises. This means that at least some of the changes are going to go through but they have to be authorized by Congress first. Right now the only reason why it hasn't happened yet is that some Congressmen are scared of how these changes are going to affect rural areas in their district. This change by nature is going to lessen the value of Netflix's DVD service. The question is by how much? You would have to order your movie by Wednesday or you're not going to have anything to watch over the weekend. Netflix really does not have any control over this.<p>The streaming sides problems are of course that everyone wants a chunk of the action. If Netflix wants to stream newer movies then they are going to have to pay up. Netflix streaming already has a wide assortment of movies but the most popular section of any video store is the new movie section. Its the same with Netflix as well. Hollywood learned the lessons of the music business vs Apple. They do not want to see that game played again. Apple has a stranglehold on the music world right now. Netflix is not going to be afforded the same luxury in doing the same with movies.<p>The crazy part is that, for me at least, $16 for unlimited streaming and one movie at a time is not a bad value. But it is the jarring way in how they raised the price which had me ready to quit the service all together. The $6 jump felt like a screw you.",1316131975

When analyzing actual speech it becomes clear that there are no real steady states, but much coarticulation between the ""segments"". Of course, part of it could be attributed to the fact that speech sounds are produced by articulatory gestures, which necessarily overlap in time. On the other hand, these coarticulation patterns are not language-independent. So, a purely (articulatory/auditory) phonetical explanation of why these differences exists is rather unlikely.. \nI know this seems rather off-topic with regard to speech recognition, but the question of the basic building blocks of language is kind of at the heart of the problem.",1272880700

No, but it looks like it is when the x-axis starts at 50.\n</code></pre>\nHowever, when you start the axis at 0, the differences between the differences seem very small, while they are what is interesting. That is why this graph start at a different value: the author isn't interested in the absolute numbers: he's interested in the differences from a baseline. Now he could have shown a graph where '0' was the average and plot all the differences, but then many more people would have become confused. Instead he choose the '50' as a baseline, arbitrarily.<p>Both you and the grandparent are completely wrong in acting all indignant that someone would display a graph like this, when it is a well accepted way to draw attention to the aspects that matter. If I started such a graph at 0, my thesis advisor would rhetorically ask me ""What are you trying to convey here?"".<p>From any graph, you can draw right and wrong conclusions. You insist that this graph is wrong because the simplest conclusion you can draw from it is wrong. Well, that's not the fault of the graph: that is the fault of you trying to interpret the graph in an overly naive way, without considering the <i>point</i> of the graph.",1272880023

1314369,comment,1314300,1314361,0,0,antirez,,,"Hello. Write in non real time Linux is not able to guarantee that it will return in a given amount of time, still all the system calls have more or less predictable timing behavior when the disk and the CPU are not busy. What I mean is that if you remove the fsync() call from the other thread, what you get is a constant stream of ""13 microseconds"" delays.<p>So when fsync() is not into the mix the kernel will do the right thing, will use buffers and will make the write calls very cheap. This is important for many applications. But when there are more strict durability requirements this is no longer true and care must be used.<p>Non blocking I/O (aio_*) is an interesting alternative in some application, but in the case of Redis it is important to return ""OK"" only after we got an acknowledge from write(2). Doing this suspending the client and resuming it when the write was performed will turn Redis from a 140k operations/second database into a 10k operations second database, so this is not going to be the solution.<p>Real world software is written not reading manual pages, but checking how the underlying OS actually works IMHO. For instance Redis persistence uses fork() copy-on-write semantic of modern operation system. Also the fact that write(2) can block per semantic, does not mean you'll be happy to know your kernel is blocking a process for seconds many times as a result of a write(2) operation.",1272877212

The introduction of islam to much of the world was through trade, just the same as the christians. And if you take slavery, trade and military occupations to be evidence that ""The real lesson is that some religions are actually militant political movements wrapped up in religion."" then I am afraid you will have to say the same of christianity.<p>Once again, the point is that extremists / militants use religion (or any other reason) to justify occupation, oppression and murder. To fight militant-ism you have to do just two things.

Remember that the original context was ""Moneyball"" - sussing out the ""true value"" of baseball players using statistics as opposed to basing decisions on less accurate gut (or social) assessments of value.<p>This use of ""true"" merely means ""accurate"" - corresponding with reality.  The aims, in the case of baseball, are implicit, of course - the aim of any manager is to win games.  In the case of books, people's aims will differ more.  This means there's no <i>single</i> ""true value"" but for any given aim there will be some amount that book will contribute to it.

Those are some great points, and something that we've been discussing for some time.<p>We're experimenting with a couple marketing strategies. Our primary strategy has been to focus on students for a grassroots adoption, hence the silly marketing copy and the koala logo. We've been handing out t-shirts and posting funny flyers on various college campuses.<p>In addition, we are talking to professors to encourage them to officially adopt Tabule in their classrooms. The teachers that are currently using Tabule are seeing a large increase in student participation, since they feel more comfortable asking questions. It also provides the students with an official source for due dates that's collaboratively maintained, so it should always be correct.<p>The biggest problem is, like you mentioned, the students that are most likely to be organized and post content to Tabule are also the ones that have less of a need for a system like ours. That's why we are starting to lean towards focusing more on marketing directly to instructors, although that is a much harder market to reach and to convince to try new technology.<p>Having said that, I think you would still find Tabule useful over organizing assignments yourself in Google Calendar because if an assignment is announced later in the semester and isn't on the initial syllabus or if a due date changes, you're more likely to have the correct information if you and your classmates are using Tabule.",1350279465

4653874,comment,4653653,4653653,31,0,mwill,,,"Sorry for the long post, just wanted to put my perspective down for once.<p>I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was about 7-8, by advice of a teacher. 
If I had to put a severity to it, I'd guess severe. When I was in young, it was a physical feeling of pain in my stomach when I fought against the urge to stand up and walk around. 
Before I was diagnosed, I literally couldn't write my own name without help, because I wouldn't sit and do it. After being put on medication, I basically got straight A's and B's through to high school.<p>Half way through high school, I started to hate the medication, I was depressed and tried to take myself off them secretly. Within the first week, most of my teachers started raising eyebrows and the school called home to see what was going on. After a few trips to the paediatrician, psychologist, and agreeing to weekly therapy at the school, I was taken off the medication.<p>It got pretty grizzly. 
One of my teachers would routinely send me out of the classroom for entire periods because he figured I wasn't going to learn anyway, and I was disrupting everyone else. 
I started to struggle in classes I loved, which got incredibly frustrating, I remember clearly knowing the answer to a problem in math class, but struggling to actually write it down, or being in music class (I was the school bands drummer), and struggling to to finish a single song because I couldn't help standing up and stepping away from the drum kit half way through.<p>It was devastating to me to find I couldn't do these things I knew I was good at without the help of the medication I fought to get off. I'd get off of school and just walk around town. Somehow, one day, I ended up walking into the local TAFE/Curtin (This is in a town in Australia), and for some reason started looking at their class lists. One of the admin's started talking to me, and convinced me to go talk to one of the teachers, who convinced me to give it a try.<p>Being a small town, the classes were basically empty, so I was almost one on one with the teacher, who let me work through at my own pace. I ended up powering through all the work for the Certificate III and Certificate IV pretty quickly, and he asked me to enrol in the Diploma (For those that don't know, here in aus a Cert/Diploma is under an undergraduate degree), introduced me to the teacher, and she gave me the entire course load in advance, which I also powered through.<p>They called me in and sat me down and told me I should apply for an undergraduate degree program in the city, and wrote letters of recommendation for me. I did, not really expecting anything to come of it (Remember I was about 14-15 at the time, and still attending high school, and basically failing), and after a few weeks of frantic phone calls, and incredible support from my amazing parents, I got accepted.<p>I ended up graduating just after my 18th birthday, with an award for grades.<p>I think about it pretty regularly, what my life would have been like if I hadn't discovered programming via TAFE. I'm 100% certain I could not have finished high school without medication, with high enough marks to get into Uni. And even if I could have, I probably would have assumed that my body would fight me every step of the way just like high school, and opted not to go. I wish I could tell all the people who are in the position I was in at that age, terrified of the future, feeling trapped in a body that won't let them be normal, that, hey, maybe there ARE things you can do. I've described programming as a 'blind spot' for my ADHD. And if I have a blind spot, maybe others do to. I'd like to hope that everyone has something they can do that helps them feel better.<p>I still struggle with ADHD, I still have trouble sitting through a movie, I get frustrated at myself at the drop of a hat, hell, to be honest, theres a part of me that's proud I managed to type this story out in only one sitting. But I can program, and I honestly feel like that saved my life.",1350278253

This was all based on emulating the behaviour of Mohammed (known as sunnah in islamic practice); Mohammed took 20% of the spoils from his army of warriors.  (Some describe him as the profit of 20% because of this).  This can be verified in The Life of Mohammed, the first biography of Mohammed (and written by a muslim 100 years after the death of Mohammed).  The author, Ibn Ishaq, was a christian who was taken as a slave to Medina, and converted to islam for a better life (one of the inducements used in the spread of islam).<p>The real lesson is that christianity endured 300 years of this aggression, before Pope Urban made christianity do an about turn, and began the (very minimal) Crusades against islam.  They were a failure, and islamic violence against European christendom continued until the Siege of Vienna (when Jan Sobieski defeated the muslim army on September 11, 1683).<p>Watch just 1 minute of this video to see what happened:

The white slave trade continued for hundreds of years (it was stopped by a joint British/US naval bombardment of Algeria in 1815).  In 1951 the UN report on slavery calculated that 5% of the population of Saudi Arabia and Yemen were still slaves.<p>Buddhism did not respond in the same way as christianity to islamic aggression.  Many experts on the history of buddhism say that buddhism died about 1000 years ago (e.g. Conze).  And they explicitly attribute this death of buddhism to the onslaught of the islamic invasion & destruction in India.<p>The real lesson is that some religions are actually militant political movements wrapped up in religion.  Islam is one such religion.  Islamic militancy was going on for hundreds of years before christianity responded in kind.",1350278212

(then figure out what you want to program, figure out the technologies it would take to make it happen, then learn them, and do it)<p>Do you want to get better at the trade so that at some point someone will pay you to program? (then go through MIT's OpenCourseWare: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm</a> on CS topics to build up your fundamentals, then start reviewing/helping/hacking on open source for a while)<p>Do you want to use programming as a tool to do other things that you are interested in?

I held myself back until college, where I did my best to learn and program as much as possible. After college, I went to grad school, continued programming as much as I could (I wrote an editor in Python for Python, dozens of data compression libraries, several distinct MUDs, ...), and got a PhD in theoretical computer science. Since then, I've been working in industry (because the academic market is crappy right now).<p>So I again ask; what is your destination? If you don't know yet, that's okay. You can improve your skills, your fundamental knowledge, and your technique without taking formal classes (see my link to MIT's OpenCourseWare).

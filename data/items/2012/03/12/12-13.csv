But other OS don't go always smoothly either.<p>Since linux isn't widespread, all we've got is our anecdotes. And my anecdote is that I installed ubuntu on my non-techie relatives' computers. And that has been great both for me and for them. They still do the same thing they've been doing before. (mostly facebooking, casual gaming, skyping etc) And I don't need to run for rescue because of crapware bloat, viruses and all kinds of weird crashes as before.<p>So if you have parents who often calls for help because of computer problems. I'd recommend you try installing ubuntu for them and see it for yourself. Judging from my experience, I'd say it's ready for prime time. (and btw, that was much before 11.10)",1331557030

No matter how much you or I like free software, Minecraft can't run as good on OpenJDK as on Sun JDK, and I automatically install the proprietary Flash version because the other one's just way too laggy to use. I also always run smxi to get the best graphics drivers and compability with the least amount of work.<p>And even then I struggle with drivers: I went from a Radeon HD 6870  to a GTX 550 TI just to be able to run Linux on my machine.

3693239,comment,3692771,3692997,0,0,w0utert,,,"> You don't remember what the original argumentation was. Firefox is free, Mozilla can't afford the patent licensing, that's all.<p>IIRC, there were other reasons not to support using the OS codecs. H264 license fees are not an issue when you just use the codecs the OS provides, as they are already covered by the OS or codec vendor. With all the Google millions that Firefox gets each year, the license fee should not really be a problem anyway.<p>What I understand from it, is that it would take a lot of effort to use system codecs for different video formats, while still providing the complete set of HTML5 video functions for every format.<p>I never really bought this argument since IE, Safari and Chrome appear to handle this just fine, if you have Perian installed for example, you can even play HTML5 WebM directly from Safari. So I think we can safely conclude there were no other arguments for Mozilla's decision not to support H264 through system codecs, besides ideological ones.<p>Personally, I think this is great news. Everyone should just stop complaining about the supposed H264 patent issues, standardize on it, and move on. The patents have never been a problem and they never will, you only need to pay license fees if you make money off of H264, in which case you should just pay up, technology like this doesn't fall from trees. The moment WebM/VP8 would gain any traction at all on the internet, it would prove to be a patent minefield just like H264, as you simply cannot make a modern video codec without violating any patents these days.",1331556589

Hanging around HN will give you the impression that scaling successful web apps is the major technical challenge in the industry today, and that's partly correct, but a lot of computing centers around entirely different topics, so if building the next successful iPhone app or social web site isn't your cup of tea, don't worry.<p>You're on the right track asking questions of people who are already working.  Keep doing that, and ask your professors, too.  My personal story is that I majored in mathematics, programmed as a hobby, and became a professional programmer almost by accident.  My math background has been a major plus in getting jobs where I work with scientists and mathematicians, not because they need me to do math (it actually doesn't come up much) but because math is a common language that lets them communicate with me easier than they could communicate with the average programmer.  Skills in applied math, computer science, and practical software development will get you in the door in a lot of interesting jobs.  My last three jobs could be roughly summed up as scientific computing, mildly distributed systems programming, and finance.<p>I would suggest you pick a field you're interested in that requires a lot of computing power and find out if there is a career for someone with CS expertise in that field.  Possibly pick up another major -- applied math would be an excellent idea if you have no particular field in mind.  But even if you stick with CS, it's an excellent field for someone who hasn't figured out what kind of work you want to do in the long term.  If you were getting a law degree and had doubts about being a lawyer, you'd be in a much worse situation :-)<p>Good luck!",1331555988

Linux won't be ready until you never have to reconfigure the graphics driver from the command line upon boot. Linux won't be ready until you can run a system update and install a new program at the same time.<p>Flashiness is nice. People like flash. Consumers <i>crave</i> flash. But flash needs to come with the same amount of wow-factor built into usability. I can make this same list of complaints about Windows and OSX, but the point remains that Windows and OSX are used and known by the public. Linux isn't.

The product is hot with a solid client base. I do sales, generating about 20% of revenue. I got on board as the 2nd employee, and there are three founders. The first emoloyee is a coder, and received 5% profit share but no equity. My compensation consists of salary (below market) and commissions, which are generous at 15% of what I bring in. There is a real possibility of being acquired in the next 2-3 years, hopefully in low 8 digits.<p>I would like to propose cutting commissions in favour of equity. My thinking is that somewhere in the realm of 3.5-4% is fair. The business had seed/angel investment which sustained the pre-rev stage but since then all growth has been from operating revenue and there are no plans for VC funding. Investors own somewhere in the order of 10-20% and founders own the rest.<p>My thinking is that commisions are a cash flow pain, and we could probably get a bigger valuation if profits are better, which would be a win for all. I've already been working with the company for nearly 2 years, which does complicate things a bit.<p>Any thoughts on this, in particularly how such a deal could be structured? I was thinking some kind of vesting schedule tied to performance, similiar to commissions, with a clause for early vesting if being acquired?",1331553685

8464262,comment,8462841,8464019,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Like many high schools they had an educational program about investing. Usually this involves some company that convinced the school that they should buy &#x27;fake investing software&#x27; for teaching.<p>Usually that software isn&#x27;t real-time. You tend to log in to some web app, pick some stocks, and at the end of the day your returns get updated.<p>The students with the highest return on investment usually win something, in my case it was my teacher smiling his ass off and congratulating me. In the above comment, they won a freaking trip to NYC haha.<p>Anyway what he&#x27;s describing is that usually these aren&#x27;t the best written software packages. After all, it&#x27;s to emulate a stock exchange for 14 year olds so they can do a project with fake stock-picking for 4 weeks. Quite often the web app trails the actual data, so people just go to the stock exchange website, see where the price is headed, then buy/sell accordingly on the fake exchange. 5 minutes later the fake exchange updates the numbers by pulling from the real exchange. It&#x27;s as if you&#x27;re betting on a baseball game that ended in the real world 5 minutes ago, as to who will win.<p>Tl;dr, kids cheated on educational stock-picking programs because kids can query the results of stocks before their software does.",1413456478
8464261,comment,8463183,8463908,0,0,phpnode,,,"Well let&#x27;s take your example and run with it.<p>If you own a house in a nice quiet street, and someone buys the place next door and wants to turn it into an inn, you&#x27;d expect to be consulted about that, right? You&#x27;d presumably expect that if everyone else in the street also objects, then planning consent for that business should be denied. If your inn analogy holds, then AirBnB provides no such opportunity for consultation.<p>The problem of high ratios of short-term occupants destroying communities is well known. The canonical example in the UK is student lets - landlords buy up properties close to universities and let them to students, over time the long term residents are forced out, leading to more and more student housing. These areas attract crime and other social problems because the community is vacant. This is why many councils in the UK restrict the number of HMOs (Houses in Multiple Occupancy) in a given street or area, presumably this happens other places too.<p>There <i>are</i> good reasons for regulating something like AirBnB or Uber, and it will happen, it just takes lawmakers a little while to catch up.",1413456474

Every CEO wants to be like Google, but very few actually commit to it.<p>It usually starts like this: the CEO wants to have smart creatives and delegate decisions. But then he thinks about all that hard-won money he&#x27;ll be throwing at an employee, so he hires someone middle level or fresh out of college &quot;with huge potential&quot;. Then he systematically micromanages the guy, because he just can&#x27;t make that jump.

I live in the Lower East Side and see an almost non-stop parade of groups of tourists with suitcases waiting to get let into apartments here. I know friends-of-friends who have four or five apartments that they rent out for this purpose.<p>People who operate these illegal hotels are attracted to neighborhoods like LES/EV/Chinatown, aside from them being trendy, is because there are a lot of non-doorman buildings that have relatively inexpensive rent. Unfortunately, those buildings are a critical source of semi-affordable housing in Manhattan, and more and more of it is getting snatched up by hoteliers.<p>I&#x27;m glad that NY is not taking the same approach as SF.

For the first time podcasters have a means to enhance their shows through providing supporting rich content, and can monetise their creative endeavours through Acast’s ad-supporting platform.<p>The ‘drag and drop’ function of the ‘Acast create’ tool allows podcast makers to place  content, such as images, music, videos and web links within their podcasts, and also gives them the opportunity to place adverts with clean breaks during the podcast episode.<p>This marks the first time advertisers have been able to advertise dynamically and monetise podcasts in a non-editorial or sponsored format.<p>Log on to www.acast.com to experience the difference.

The problem with what you are saying about weeding out unsafe listings is that pretty much any listing in a non-doorman building where there isn&#x27;t someone in the apartment to oversee the guests is going to be unsafe and reduce the quality of life for the other residents, and those types of listings account for most of the illegal rentals. Essentially, you have a parade of people with keys to the building who don&#x27;t live there, who are on vacation and don&#x27;t really care how they effect the people around them.<p>2. It is taking a critical source of semi-affordable housing off the market: apartments in non-doorman, low-rise buildings. Renters can&#x27;t compete with Airbnb on price, so more and more are getting snatched up to be run as hotels, increasing competition and driving prices up for everyone else.<p>I think the solution is almost exactly what the NY AG is pursuing: attempting to aggressively go after people renting apartments as illegal hotels so that it is no longer desirable to do operate them. Continue to allow people to &quot;share&quot; their homes by renting out a room or a couch, but restrict the &quot;entire home&quot; rentals to people who own their property and can legally do it.",1413454585

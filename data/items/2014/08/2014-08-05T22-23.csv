8139993,comment,8139220,8139220,3,0,deadgrey19,,,"I don&#x27;t write web applications, and I don&#x27;t use much JavaScript, so it&#x27;s very possible that I don&#x27;t properly understand the motivation for this blog post. However, as others have said there is a difference between some inconvenient syntax in JS, and the fundamental model of non-blocking I/O.<p>What I do write is lots of C/C++ client/server applications for HPC/HFT/DC workloads where speed both in req/sec (throughput) and speed in min/avg/max(secs/req) (latency) matters. In these environments I almost exclusively use non-blocking I/O. There are several reasons:<p>1) Threads are not free. Even if you use a thread-pool to avoid spin up costs, context switching overhead matters. Every time you call blocking I/O, you make sure that the kernel will wake up, schedule another thread, and do anything else that it decides to do. Waste time that you could have used to do useful work. Non-blocking I/O puts you in charge of your own &quot;thread scheduler&quot;. Your &quot;threads&quot; are functions, they are &quot;cooperatively scheduled&quot; and you can make full use of every cycle that you get.<p>2) Programming with threads is hard. Trust me. If you think it&#x27;s easy, or I&#x27;m soft, you haven&#x27;t done it enough. At some point you will need shared state across those threads. And then you&#x27;ll need locking and unlocking. (also Mutexs are slooooowww) And then you&#x27;ll need to handle error cases, and you&#x27;ll need to make sure that all the unlocking is done right in all of the right places. And then you&#x27;ll need signaling between your threads. And you&#x27;ll need semaphores or similar. And 3 months down the line, you&#x27;re thinking to yourself, when a foo exception causes a bar signal, will a baz handler deadlock? Will it make progress? Humans just aren&#x27;t designed to reason about this sort of thing.<p>With a single threaded, non-blocking design, it&#x27;s really easy to reason about exactly what is happening with all of your state. Debugging is obvious and straightforward. This is necessary if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t write perfect code first time. There&#x27;s only ever one function accessing shared state at one time. The &quot;scheduler&quot; is working for you, not against you. If you write your code simply, cleanly and efficiently, you&#x27;d be amazed how much work a modern CPU can really do. Honestly, once you&#x27;ve saturated a 10G NIC what more do you want to do?<p>3) If you buy into the non-blocking design, then, as long as you only use 1 process/thread per core, almost anything a thread can do, a process can do better. Threads have no memory protection, anything you touch probably belongs to some other thread and you&#x27;re inviting subtle bugs. Processes have memory protection by default if you want to share things you can do it explicitly via safe mechanisms (shared memory rings, pipes, IPC etc). Shared memory rings are (can be) so fast that data is more or less local so if you want to use shared state from a TCP connection or whatever, you can always &quot;dispatch&quot; work to another process to do it for you. You get the benefits of many cores working for you as well as a clean and obvious programming model.<p>Ultimately, if the question is one of syntax, then I&#x27;d happily believe that JS has some ugly syntax for doing these things, but if the question is one of design, then you should think really really hard before deciding that a threaded model is the correct one for you.",1407279324

My personal feelings towards it are pretty ambivalent; as a python guy, I find it tastes a lot like ruby/rails (lots of magic).

It&#x27;s not an all-around winner in concurrency.<p>Another shining example is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler runtime system. It has an exceptionally fast and efficient green thread system that (in the latest version of GHC) can scale almost-linearly up to 32 cores, even with some resource contention, and can easily handle millions of concurrent threads. I suspect you could emulate Erlang actors with very little loss of efficiency. (And, of course, you&#x27;re also free to use a thread-based model.)<p>And being a language with type-system-encapsulated mutability (and very nice resource contention management mechanisms like STM), concurrency is often &quot;free&quot; and very safe.

However, sometimes people are <i>given</i> remarkably crappy designs that they have to support, and ORMs make it much more difficult.

It&#x27;s sometimes tough to work one out, though, and I tend to do it in the DB first)<p>Transactions in an ORM have been a huge problem, so I pretty much do as much as possible in the db through stored procedures, combined with whatever application code necessary to verify everything is moving along as it should.<p>It seems to me that most developers should learn SQL and databases fairly well. They are just so common, and it&#x27;s not all that much trouble. Once you know how to normalize data and some basic SQL you&#x27;re well along the way.<p>ORMs have their place in relatively simple projects, but once code passes a certain level of complexity then ORMs cause much more pain than they are worth.

Unfortunately, I think that many people think that concurrency can be done in a library, or on non-concurrent systems like the JVM.  I understand fully why Go would like to claim to be concurrent, and all the other languages would like to claim it, because the reality is we&#x27;re in a multi-core multi-node distributed world.  But don&#x27;t fall for it.<p>Worse, there are some simple low hanging &quot;concurrent&quot; fruit like go-routines that make it seem like you&#x27;ve solved the problem.<p>I would have no problem if someone had made a language and VM or compiled-to-binary like go, that was truly concurrent, and that copied the erlang solution (no mutable state, supervision trees, let it fail, etc.)<p>Seriously, steal from the best if you&#x27;re making a new language.<p>So far, nobody has.

But sooner or later-- hopefully sooner, because it will be much more painful later-- you have to pay the piper for not being concurrent.

Can you count on enough VC money to do the same?<p>PS- not to pick on Go.  Go has several features that are really bright choices.

8139755,comment,8138541,8139348,2,0,roc,,,"This is actually a notable problem with the BIG, as presented.<p>As it includes Medicaid spending as federal benefit spending (and likely PPACA subsidies -- but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far in the footnotes) the $10k would seemingly amount to just covering every American household&#x27;s private-market insurance premiums (with no regard to whether they needed them covered and further handing &#x27;free money&#x27; to healthy young childless households whose premiums would be much lower).<p>And without being structured as Medicaid, it would abandon the other (cost-controlling/bureaucracy-reducing/waste-reducing) financial benefits of a single payer health system -- benefits over the private market that Medicaid actually delivers (according to numerous studies).<p>So the end result is that poor people would see their net benefits ruthlessly slashed, (good luck buying food and shelter after you use that 10k for market-rate insurance) all so that middle-class people can receive a stipend that they don&#x27;t need and a decrease in federal-dollar-per-hypothetical-unit-of-healthcare efficiency.<p>The most-charitable read of this proposal, is that it&#x27;s the result of a naive person doing &quot;black box math&quot; where they seek some mathematical ideal in the re-arrangement of  government payments -- without any regard to the benefits being provided, the cost-effectiveness of those benefits and whether the rearrangement is a practical improvement.<p>I mean, if we&#x27;re spending $20k per poor person, and children are still going hungry, under what logic would redistributing it as 10k to <i>every single person</i> see any sort of improvement in the ultimate goals of things like keeping children from going hungry?<p>To not see the massive benefit cut to these people that we&#x27;ve currently defined as needing help, we&#x27;d have to assume that for every dollar in tangible benefits received by the poor, there&#x27;s a dollar in bureaucratic overhead.<p>And why on earth would we accept such an implicit assumption, when the ultimate source of all these numbers -- the CBO -- has regularly assessed such administrative costs and never finds such waste? [1]<p>[1] e.g. SNAP, pointed to regularly in the CATO document source, has administrative overhead of less than 4.5% of total federal cost.  So if the average SNAP-receiving household is getting $287/mo, the overhead is $13/mo.  Under this proposal, food money going to the currently-snap-receiving household would drop to $143/mo, with $15/mo going to 9 households that don&#x27;t need SNAP. In the name of &quot;saving&quot; that $13/mo.  Most of us would look at the infeasibility of a household feeding itself for $143/mo and see their own $15/mo as a more egregious waste than the original $13.  Which, cynically speaking, is likely to be a feature.  Following such a programs initiation, it would be trivial to get voters behind the proposal to cut their own taxes by $15/mo, to save them the overhead of having the government take the money only to give it back as a stipend they don&#x27;t need.  The end result would be the massive benefit cut and the reduced taxes.<p><a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance-program-snap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fns.usda.gov/pd/supplemental-nutrition-assistance...</a><p>(EDIT: fleshed out SNAP example)",1407276060

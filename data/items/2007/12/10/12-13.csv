This doesn't seem as an important point at all.<p>Plus, Django is not an elegant of a framework at all.  The api has been developed as patchwork, and it's forms/views/models are easy if you use them for scafolding, but in real apps you have to do a lot of codding around to customize them.<p>eg. you can bind a form to a model, but you probably don't want to, or just print the forms  (often you need your own look).\nSo, while on paper django looks good,  in practice it can be frustrating.<p>\nPython is a great language, but OOP is not it's forte (at least not the kind of OOP you see in .net or java).<p>Just use something like web.py, on create your own framework.  With python is very easy to do.",1197291427

There's clearly a negative externality, and it doesn't seem to be something the market is capable of dealing with (why are there <i>never</i> any non-smoking establishments?), so how else might things be made to work without a blanket ban (which, as a non-smoker, I have to admit I love) ?",1197289938

Fortunately I don't think they'll mind too much as the nation wide smoking ban was accepted with a kind of quiet inevitability. \nFor right or wrong if the ends are largely supported, people will put up with the means (given they are not too outrageous).<p>I am currently being illuminated by an energy saving bulb and although it does take a few seconds get going it is generating a positively warm glow.",1197289639

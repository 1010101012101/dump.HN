Assign actions to a queue from the range of possible tasks, such as posting on Twitter or sending a text message, and they will be executed in order at regular intervals or on a schedule.</i><p>I posted a link on Reddit about a week ago and made some tweaks related to that feedback.

But even in these cases we try to reduce the size and complexity of the core patch.  If you look at the recent commits to JSC you'll see a bunch of refactoring landing prior to LLInt that got the non-LLInt specific code into the tree in advance of LLInt itself.  As it is the initial commit only has support for our 32bit encoding, and doesn't support all the backends that the JSC JIT supports.  The basic reason for this is that the static assembler does need to do some register allocation and the easy way to ensure that it's correct is to through it at 32 bit x86.  Our value representation requires 2 registers on 32 bit platforms, and x86-32 has very few GPRs we can use, so it acts as an excellent stress test vs. any other supported platform.",1329851241

The FM office was alive with debate this morning as it surfaced that both the drum loop and the main riff from the club-classic Faxing Berlin by Deadmau5 are available as loops in FL Studio 8. Not only that, but a little-known artist is currently being struck down by the wrath of the law for using the loop (which he assumed was Royalty-free and claims to have used not knowing it was Deadmau5's riff) in a recent release.

Outside of the specific areas that are covered (by those) there has never been any intent to prevent anyone from registering a domain name who intends to profit from selling those domain names. Any more than there has ever been a law to prevent anyone from buying anything in order to resell at a higher price (providing it doesn't break any laws.)",1329850964

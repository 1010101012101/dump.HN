While I often look for ways to take external-interaction-responsibility away from Rails objects, the OP didn&#x27;t really make sense to me, at least in terms of saving time and making things more logical.<p>However, there&#x27;s a distinction that has to be made in your example and the OP&#x27;s. In the OP, the failure of the Interactor, <i>including the delivery of emails</i>, would cause the controller to enter the &quot;failure&quot; branch:<p><pre><code>    if interactor.success?\n      redirect_to home_path\n    else\n      flash[:error] = interactor.message\n      render :new\n    end\n\n</code></pre>\nWhereas your example, the controller would take the successful branch if the data model was saved, regardless of whether email delivery failed:<p><pre><code>    if @grouper.save\n      ConfirmedGrouperEmails.new(@grouper).deliver\n      AssignBarForGrouper.enqueue(@grouper.id)\n \n      redirect_to home_path\n    else\n      render :new\n    end\n\n\n</code></pre>\nSo we&#x27;re not comparing apples to apples here. <i>However</i>, as a layperson, I&#x27;d have to agree with you: Why should the error be raised to the grouper-creating <i>user</i>, when it should be going to the part of the system that handles mailing?

7336398,comment,7334671,7335316,1,0,belovedeagle,,,"As one of those people who rarely says &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, let me offer a different view: saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; is negative and gets you nowhere. Instead of saying &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, say what you do know. Then you&#x27;re a step closer to understanding than anyone who said &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;; and you&#x27;re likely to be several steps ahead by the time they get over that hesitation.<p>Now, guesses should never be presented as absolute facts, but having a guess puts you much closer to the truth than having nothing. If you really, truly have nothing, no relevant knowledge---which should rarely happen if you&#x27;re well-educated and/or experienced, in which case you&#x27;re a novice to the subject, where somewhat different rules apply---then say so; otherwise, go with what you know and learn the rest on the way. Will mistakes sometimes happen? Will you sometimes head down dead-ends? Absolutely, but that&#x27;s part of the learning process and we shouldn&#x27;t be afraid of mistakes, as long as we&#x27;re in a process which is tolerant of them. (If you&#x27;re pushing code to production, for example, then that&#x27;s a time either to know or not to know, not to guess. But that&#x27;s the end of the process, not when you&#x27;re asking questions.)<p>So if you said to me, &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot;, I might look at you funny because it&#x27;s probably not true: you probably do know, at least partially; it just seems like you&#x27;re not willing to acknowledge that.",1393880279

Maybe this is because they see the lenders as individuals like them.<p>Our members, borrowers and lenders, communicate with each other regularly through the website, and sometimes meet in person as well - for example, Zidisha members in Nakuru, Kenya, held a conference last week.

So really, a BATNA in a salary negotiation for a new position is not taking the position. In an existing position where you&#x27;re going for a raise, your BATNA is quitting.<p>BATNA isn&#x27;t a bargaining position, it&#x27;s your fallback option in case bargaining fails. I think you&#x27;re talking more about your &quot;bottom line&quot;, which is the lowest number you&#x27;re willing to accept. A good negotiator goes in knowing his/her BATNA and bottom-line, but they&#x27;re separate concepts.<p>I also completely disagree with you disregarding objective criteria. I used my recent purchase of a 2-year old vehicle as a way to gain some extra experience in negotiating and work on different approaches with two separate dealers. My initial approach with the dealer I ultimately bought from, was to derive my bottom-line number from objective criteria, but to show no strong evidence to how I got the numbers I was offering. I got nowhere with that approach. The sales manager didn&#x27;t even come out to stop me from leaving when negotiations with the salesman got nowhere. We were only $1,000 from my bottom-line (which he didn&#x27;t know) and about $1,800 away from our stated positions.<p>I came back a few days later with reasonable evidence based on market data of the particular model I was buying, as well as reasons why I&#x27;d go spend more money on another manufacturers&#x27; similar, but nicer model in the same class. They ended up coming down the full $1,800 after I was about to walk away again.<p>This works time and time again. Unless you&#x27;re in a position where you completely don&#x27;t care if you complete a purchase/sale/agreement, then holding onto unrealistic positions will never get you very far.

By the time the code gets out the door,  whether through a dump on the net or even worse, through a channel partner and onto a shelf at Fry&#x27;s, all the engineers are working on new projects.   There is sometimes a six-month lag from the time the code is compiled until it shows up on a store.   By then the technology has changed no one gives shit about the old stuff.    There is no incentive and certainly no corporate push to go fix the bugs that got shipped.   I know I always felt like it would be a simple thing to go patch the code, but it was never a priority for the management.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you the really screwy thing about BCM43xx development.  We sold reference designs to companies like 3Com and Linksys  (before and after acquisition by Cisco), Apple, D-Link, etc.   All of them got the same reference design, in theory, but if one of those companies reported a bug in our code, that company would  be the only one to get the patched code.    As a consequence our code was littered with #ifdef (COMS) or #ifdef (LINKSYS) with specific patches enabled.   The other companies, those that hadn&#x27;t yet discovered the bug, would get updates that we <i>knew</i> were broken.    It was terrible for the companies, even worse for the customers of those companies.<p>Plus there were source releases to those companies and they weren&#x27;t allowed to know about patches that they didn&#x27;t receive.   So we had a step in our build process called the code transmogrifier.   That would go through the code and expand certain C preprocessor symbols so the code no longer contained #ifdef (COMS) or #ifdef (LNIKSYS).   That way every company got a different source code release as well.   We would do separate compiles of the transmogrified code for each customer.<p>Then we had all the customization because those companies had fired all their own engineers and instead wanted us to produce a product that was branded &quot;Cisco&quot; or &quot;Linksys&quot;.   We had to take the exact same code an rebrand copyright strings to make it look like it was written by our customers.<p>I voted with my feet and left the industry.",1393878767

They even covered the major problem earlier in the article... and then completely ignored it when offering solutions.<p>>Starting in the ’80s, productivity gains were no longer shared with workers. Therefore, the wage share of the economy began to decrease. As a percentage of total output, wages have fallen from a high of almost 52 percent around 1970 to less than 43 percent today (see Graph 1). Meanwhile, inequality within wages also increased. The upshot? The rich began capturing nearly all the results of economic growth—the top 1 percent’s share of national income increased from about 8 percent in the mid-’70s to about 23 percent today....they “save” by buying financial assets—which means that most of the fruits of economic growth have been channeled into asset price increases, rather than consumer price inflation.<p>If you just give everyone more money to increase AD via QE, tax cuts, free income or whatever else... it all gets spent and where do the increased sales and profits go?

Considering Samsung&#x27;s reputation as a reliable supplier for quality/scale, it was a good idea. Even Apple considers Samsung as essential for their parts due to quality/scale. The rumors were reported for months.<p>But nothing came out of it. And then we started hearing about Tesla building ITS OWN billion dollar battery factory in cooperation with Panasonic. So I started thinking WHAT happened?<p>My guess is that Tesla wanted guarantee that Samsung would NOT get into electric car business in America (not unreasonable looking at apple/samsung), but Samsung didn&#x27;t want to go along with it. I think Samsung is willing to lose the battery business with Tesla to have another crack at the new (electric) car business again.<p>The Dell/samsung deal is a good example. Around 2000, Dell/Samsung signed a 10-year part deal. This was at the height of the RAM crisis (due to shortage prices were wildly fluctuation, if available at all). Samsung was up-and-coming RAM maker and Dell wanted to a secure supply of RAM. Dell signed deal with Samsung and Samsung agreed to meet parts demand from Dell (RAM, cddrive, monitor etc). It was a billion dollar, 10-year deal. Along with it, Samsung agreed to withdraw from PC business in US at the request of Dell (unknown to public at the time). This I think Samsung regretted later as Samsung was forgotten as a PC maker in US. In the decade of 2000-2010, I remember reading about good Samsung laptop reviews on notebookreview.com but you couldn&#x27;t buy them in US. They were available only in S Korea/Asia/Europe/etc, but not in US. One of earlier very popular Dell laptop (everyone I knew had one) was a rebadged Samsung laptop actually.<p>Basically Samsung was locked out of PC business in America and it cost them dearly in brand recognition in US, which Samsung apparently wants to avoid.<p>In a way, Samsung not agreeing the possible Tesla&#x27;s request is reasonable (I should admit I have no proof of it but circumstantial evidences support it). Samsung is ALREADY in car business (albeit it&#x27;s a flop) and with the new generation of electric cars that will replace gas powered cars, Samsung made correct choice of not agreeing to Tesla&#x27;s request.",1393878397

Of course, students can learn procedures to make the switch from discrete to continuous models, but even then it is possible that this procedural experience is not build on deeper mathematical understanding.

If our economy were running at capacity, new government spending, for example, would tend to create inflation because the capacity (workers, raw materials, and equipment) would have to be bid away from someone else, thereby raising prices. But during a depression that doesn’t happen. Instead, new spending brings idle capacity into production.<p>I think this paragraph is really important to think about until you get it.

Google won over AltaVista and Yahoo by being superior. I still remember the first time I tried it, it was so much better that it made an instant convert out of me, even though typing &quot;altavista.com&quot; was rooted in my nervous system and this was in the days before they were big, before AdSense/AdWords/AdX. And I could see it at Internet Cafes catching like fire, within mixtures of technically oriented and unsophisticated users alike.<p>And it can happen again. What pains do normal users have when using Google lately? Malware, content farms, &quot;aggregators&quot;, too many ads. The only reason for why Google is still number 1 with a near monopoly is because there is no better alternative. DuckDuck Go is awful for me. Bing too. You may not notice how awful they are, unless you&#x27;re living outside the US.<p>And I&#x27;m pretty sure they know that they can lose users fast. And once a significant chunk of users are gone, advertisers will be gone too. That&#x27;s why Android exists in the first place, though distributing Bing as the default doesn&#x27;t really help Microsoft, so having your own platform only protects you against walled gardens. And there&#x27;s even a bigger danger therein. Google doesn&#x27;t even have to lose users for advertisers to leave - Google already knows that the majority of clicks on all served ads are done by a minority and advertisers are increasingly aware of this fact too, as quality conversions are going down. This is because targeting is not so good after all and because users are increasingly fed up with spamy results and annoying ads that aren&#x27;t targeted well.<p>I think their problem is that they are trying to solve this through algorithms only. The problem with algorithms is that algorithms can be gamed, you only need to find the ranking formula, which can of course be done through trial and error. It&#x27;s a whac-a-mole game basically.<p>But for popular searches, like Firefox, they could have exceptions in there to propel those as first results. Is it not obvious that users searching for Firefox actually want Firefox, the browser from Mozilla.com, in spite of Mozilla.com&#x27;s ranking? Is this against their policy or something? And now that they have Google+ accounts, why don&#x27;t they add a &quot;<i>Report Result</i>&quot; button?

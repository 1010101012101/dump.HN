If you have something like a bunch of GitHub projects to point to, that would definitely be reassuring.<p>(Also, I&#x27;m not sure which US/Canadian companies you&#x27;re applying to, but the well known tech companies are extremely hard to get into, even for US applicants.

9126878,comment,9118977,9121319,0,0,mercer,,,"I think one of the nice things about programming, and one of the things that will ensure that programmers will always be in high demand, is that as tools improve, our desires and needs and aims adjust accordingly.<p>Just consider web development. There was a time you could make decent money with &#x27;simple&#x27; HTML/CSS work. Clients were happy with that. Then you had to move to CMS-based sites, because people demanded the ability to add and edit content easily. Then you had to start offering plugins and more complex tools because everyone needed more than just a contact form to interact with their site visitors. And now everyone wants web apps, which are significantly more complex than simple websites.<p>I suspect that people who love programming and are good at it will keep moving up along the ladder of abstraction, and if anything there will be more and more need for experts at every rung of this ladder as companies get stuck with &#x27;old&#x27; technology (for example, I could make a killing as a Drupal consultant).",1425214415

Assuming the fad hangs on long enough, I suspect every &quot;work truck&quot; in the country could end up with a spam transmitter, so if a neighbor hires a plumber the neighbors will all be spammed while the plumber truck is on site.<p>The other is playing weird games with powering the beacon off the same power strip or wall outlet as the &quot;Open&quot; sign, on the theory that spamming people when you&#x27;re not even open isn&#x27;t nice.  So, open for business, out flows the spam, closed for whatever reason, off goes the spam.<p>Of course spamming people isn&#x27;t nice, regardless of being mobile or open, so the primary user interaction will be shutting off beacon spam, much like the only interaction I have with notifications on my phone is shutting off spammy apps so I don&#x27;t have to ever see a notification again from that app.  You get to sell one ad, once.",1425213441

You should thank them for biting you.<p>What nonsense. Imagine if Google took the SO approach to quality and prioritized making you jump through hoops with your question over trying to find the best answer it can: &quot;your phrasing is ambiguous; if you think otherwise, you can try rephrasing your query properly and try again&quot;, or &quot;you have misspelled one of the search terms; you should figure out which one and look up the correct spelling before submitting a search; this is, you&#x27;ll agree, in everyone&#x27;s best interest&quot;. Or, &quot;not a constructive search query; might lead to pages that include opinions&quot;. Or how about, &quot;some of the words in your query resemble those in another query made several years ago; here are their results; if their results aren&#x27;t helpful to you, you should have asked a better question.&quot;<p>Of course SO, unlike Google, stores the questions, but SO could still learn from Google&#x27;s example. Google is so useful, because instead of improving quality by strictly limiting what it will index and what you can ask (&quot;no pages expressing opinions&quot;, &quot;index no new pages discussing any aspect of a topic if some aspect of that topic was discussed on another page already in the index&quot;, &quot;the answer to your query has been found but will not be displayed, because it was not of interest to our moderators&quot;), it includes as much <i>real</i> (not fake) content as it can and uses technology to lead <i>any</i> question to the most relevant answer it can.<p>How ironic that when you use Google to find a programming answer, it so often judges some Stack Overflow entry most relevant. Then, if you follow the link, you find that someone was trying to provide exactly the answer you were looking for, but the mods spotted him, ruled that what Google had correctly deemed most relevant to be &quot;Not Constructive!&quot; and had forbidden anyone else from answering.<p>I&#x27;d love to see an alternative to SO that optimized for answering questions instead of controlling them. One that allowed almost any programming question, allowed anyone who wanted to answer to freely answer, that collected reams of overlapping explanations and answers to multiple variations of programming questions, and that used state of the art technology to lead questioners to those answers that were likely to be most successful at answering your specific question, while leaving the question open to anyone who wanted to volunteer new answers, even if they are repeats or opinions, or provide their own best-guess links to previous answers.",1425211664

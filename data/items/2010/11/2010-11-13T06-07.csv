</code></pre>
then I can do this:<p><pre><code>    p o.methods
</code></pre>
...and see what I can call. The method names give me no guarantee as to what the methods will actually do (""slice"" could return a subset of data, or cut a pie), but once I have the verbs, in either case, I can <i>experiment</i>. That's the important bit here—discoverability isn't about knowing what new things do right off the bat, because that's impossible unless there's a finite set of things you can do; discoverability is simply about being told the affordances, so you can manipulate them and observe the results.",1289631352

I spent well over $100 on a hairstylist chair (I had to watch the auctions for weeks before one even showed up), and people would pay $2 or more to have their hair cut/styled. For the first while I did it for free- just for the cost of hair gel and supplies.

For example, an average sized person can eat a single-patty hamburger and HALF of a SMALL order of fries with NO drink, and be full.  This ""bad"" food has never gotten me in trouble, because I keep the calorie count sane.  What gets people in trouble is thinking that they actually need to buy the large fries and a massive drink, add bacon and cheese, and finish with cookies.  Then they do it every day, and also stop at Starbucks in the afternoons.<p>One pound (of body fat) is 3500 calories.  This is good to remember when you see a single shake at Baskin Robbins that is 2000.<p>Exercise is important, but overrated.  Remember that humans burn calories even sitting still.  So when the treadmill tells you that you burned 140 calories, that is a bit of a lie, because you would have burned maybe 80 if you did nothing at all.  It is far more important to just eat and drink fewer calories to begin with.",1289630339

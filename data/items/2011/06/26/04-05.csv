2697404,comment,2696897,2696897,3,0,trussi,,,"The downside of a loan is that it will require a personal guarantee, which means you're personally liable to pay it back.  If the business fails (or more specifically the business is unable to make the loan payments and defaults on the loan), it will negatively affect your credit.  Ruining your credit isn't as bad as most people make it out to be, especially if you're young and can endure 7 years with only paying cash for everything (it's a good lesson to learn young).<p>Assuming your venture is successful, the huge upside to a loan is that it's the cheapest money you can possibly get.  Even at something like a crazy 16% interest rate on hard money leg-breaker type loans, it's way cheaper than giving away 10-40% of your company to get VC money.<p>The other upside to a loan is that you have WAY more flexibility in the direction of your company, especially in terms of exit timelines.  Everybody (i.e. those in the VC bubble) bashes 'lifestyle' businesses, but it's hard to turn your nose up at $10-50K per month in passive income.  With VC money, you are forced into pursuing very fast and hard growth which generally sucks (from a founder perspective).  With a loan, you can grow nice and slow and comfortably or you can go balls to the wall...it's your choice.<p>With that said, the absolute best investors are customers.  Leave yourself a 35-50% financial buffer, but only borrow enough to get to profitability through revenue.  If you can hit that magical moment, it's as close to nirvana as most of us will ever get. :)",1309063838

If you have the time to cook after your job, wouldn't you be tempted to get a second job instead of cooking, if only to make your constant, grinding debt go away faster?<p>Then you get into 'cultural poverty', where someone flatly doesn't know how to cook because their parents never cooked and only ate at cheap restaurants (which isn't cheap) and used prepared food.

Indie music. It is alive and well, and the best bands working right now are not playing in arenas. In any major city in the country on any given night (and at least once or twice a week in most mid-sized cities), you can see a great band for five to fifteen bucks.

That's just crazy talk.<p>A good, no, great stay-home friend of ours is watching our kids our most of the summer. We have half-jokingly discussed getting a bigger house and just moving both families in. seriously, the savings in time and money and health are tremendous. Not only is it cheaper or them and us, we routinely (even before the summer) had their family over or they have us for dinner. If we ever move, it may require family counseling.<p>That's what's involved. Overcome the physical isolation of modern life and you can overcome some of the economics.<p>Now, here's the catch. We met vis-a-vis the playground. See, my son and their son are in the same class and my wife and he chatted at the playground for a month, oh and we both live two blocks from school in the same direction. And at the time, they were hard up for some place to eat as their kitchen was demolished as part of a major remodel.<p>yeah, that's way to many coincidences. But somebody could male a website for this. C'mon: you can get a babysitter over the web, you can get airbnb. Surely we can network neighborhoods.",1309061357

The real brilliance about Khan Academy, in my mind, is that they aren't just another video tutorial repository.  They have a sophisticated back-end tracking system that allows teachers and parents to gauge the level of comprehension the students are working at.<p>The other thing to note about Khan, is that the site is precisely intended for younger students in an effort to give them a solid foundational backing for further study.<p>Personally, I don't think we need another resource for experienced developers.  Experienced developers have a level of understanding that already allows them to be more critical of the tools and resources they choose.  If you're truly interested in following the Khan model, you should be focusing on the core fundamentals that are often taken for granted in many of the other resources.  That's not to say that you couldn't expand to more advanced topics, but starting at the lowest level and working up would be more beneficial in my eyes.<p>Anyhow, interested to see what you get up there.

Lion's adding support for auto-save? You'd better believe that implementing auto-save support into iWork is a top priority, regardless of what the iWork PM thinks about it. That said, Apple seems to rarely hire people who don't share the same vision, and with that comes a certain uniformity of direction that tends to reduce inter-project scuffles.<p>Also, I get the sense that if (for example) the project manager for iWork was causing unnecessary friction with other teams instead of working with them towards a common goal, he'd be replaced with someone else who's more of a team player.",1309060929

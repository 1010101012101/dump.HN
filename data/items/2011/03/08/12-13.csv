Do you not have uncles, did they not come for dinner, what of aunties, and did you never go to your friends house where you would meet their parents, etc.<p>I do not think anyone isolates kids or teenagers. I think, instead, the media attempts to portray such a picture so as to sell more papers.<p>Regarding your latter comment, in a world where you do not mix even with the seventh graders or the fifth graders if you are in the sixth grade, it would be quite strange indeed if you were ""hanging out"" with a 40 year old, or 30 year old, in ""friendship"" basis both for the youngster and for the adult. Moreover, I do not think it ever was seen as ""normal"" not because of any implications but because there would be little in common not least because a teenager thinks and is preoccupied by entirely different things from an adult.",1299589085

It's not a ""roll-your-own"" aptitude, it's a different approach to the problem.  Puppet is primarily meant to manage the sort of end-user configuration for which packages only provide defaults.  If you're handling all of that with the package manager, or if your need to manage configuration is minimal, then don't use puppet.  It doesn't have lots of dependencies but it does have some, and it's language is syntaxy.",1299588995

People use their real names, and hook up with their real friends, resulting in a real social graph.<p>But if Facebook becomes the single-sign-on provider, the identity provider, for a majority of blogs and forums and other venues where people today participate anonymously, then Facebook will start seeing a huge number of fake profiles appear as people make multiple identities to preserve their privacy and anonymity, and the more those fake profiles are used, the less the real userbase will be worth, which ultimately threatens their bottom line.",1299586220

You can't imagine how powerful and motivating that was (and still is) to me.<p>Also, Patrick, notably you dedicated a full post on your blog on VWO <a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/12/09/bringing-ab-testing-to-the-fortune-5-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2009/12/09/bringing-ab-testing-to-t...</a> and it brought bootload of beta testers. That was AMAZING! I iterated through every piece of feedback and refined it.<p>It's hard to imagine VWO existing in form it exists today had you not helped initially. Thanks for all of this!

They don't even behave like people -- more like ""statues that bleed"".<p>> <i>A huge difference is the controls. In CTC you aim by timing the release during the swing of the trebuchet. This is tricky</i><p>I'm not so sure. I find operating the trebuchet more intuitive / simple than pulling the sling in the right direction with the right amount of force to send the birds in the air.<p>BTW, birds fly; they don't need a sling to be airborne... Those ""angry birds"" are in fact chickens.<p>Chickens vs. pigs: a simple farm image that speaks to everyone and draws on childhood memories?",1299585934
2300610,comment,2300042,2300042,0,0,johndlafayette,,,"From my limited understanding, if you simply submit a  application, you are protected until it is reviewed plus the time granted with a patent. So if you pay the new smaller amount, and it takes the PO 5 years to review your patent instead of the normal 1 for corporations, you'll have an extra 4 years of protection over the life of the patent. Clock starts once it's reviewed and accepted, but protection starts once it's filed. Depending on how much cheaper this is for small businesses, it could potentially help them out by offering longer protection for less money, if only because it takes longer for their patents to be reviewed.<p>But I think I agree with asnyder for the most part. Most people don't even know where to start, and may lose protection simply because they didn't know what to do before the idea spread and someone else with the know-how made the product and patented it.",1299585845

Everybody and their cousin flock to San Francisco expecting to find gold and strike it rich.

As in the case above, it can impact deal flow as companies seeking funding may think twice about approaching a firm believed to be in that category. It can hurt a firm’s prospects of being invited into syndicates and even potentially damage a firm’s existing syndicates. It can jeopardize relationships with current and prospective LPs if a forthcoming fund is even a notion among the firm’s GPs. Finally, and perhaps most troubling of all, it can even damage the prospects of portfolio companies backed by these supposed walking dead VCs.</i><p><a href=""https://jonathantower.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/time-to-rethink-walking-dead-vc-firms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jonathantower.wordpress.com/2010/12/17/time-to-rethi...</a><p>Google clearly has skin in the game here if this narrative means that they will lose engineering talent from G+.

7645073,comment,7644489,7644758,2,0,brokenparser,,,"There may be some misconceptions here, so I&#x27;ll clarify a few things just in case:<p>1) Net neutrality doesn&#x27;t mean everyone gets the exact same speed. ISPs are free to offer a plethora of offerings each with their own price, speed and extras (if any). There are also no new guarantees to subscribers, i.e. if the wiring is crap deal with it.<p>2) CDNs have nothing to do with net neutrality. A typical large ISP will offer co-location services and content providers may use the service the same as any other customer. There can even be other arrangements as they see fit, but the important thing is that no one messes with the tubes.<p>3) Again, just in case because this is brought up a lot, ISPs can still offer filtered subscriptions. There&#x27;s a market demand for filtered subscriptions and catering to that demand is fair game.<p>4) ISPs are still free to apply filters on traffic in the interests of maintaining their network. This is important for example when dealing with (D)DoS attacks or worm outbreaks.<p>Net neutrality levels the playing field for content providers, so if you get VoIP from your ISP the service may still be better than that of a given competitor by virtue of having less latency. But what the ISP cannot do is artificially inflate their advantage, as doing so would be in violation of a free market on the Internet.<p><i>EDIT</i>: disambiguated things",1398408514

On top of this, when you use replaygain in your audio player, the digital volume adjustment is applied to a 24bit signal, and Windows (or whatever OS) has a 24bit or 32bit float signal path, and then most or all DACs are 24bit (for example newish Realtek integrated audio).

7644974,comment,7642545,7644895,1,0,aidenn0,,,"> If comcast is PAID zero dollars...<p>Comcast gets paid $50/month per subscriber for that bandwidth.  It costs Comcast less money to peer with Netflix than to get it from cogent.  Comcast wants Netflix to pay to solve a problem that Comcast&#x27;s customers have.<p>> Is it possible there&#x27;s no scarcity of bandwidth on Comcast&#x27;s network?<p>Absolutely!  In fact, that&#x27;s part of what the chart shows; when Netflix peered with Comcast, the video quality (which is a proxy for bitrate to the consumer) went up significantly, which indicates that there was no bottleneck on the Comcast network.<p>> Price ... is just a means of efficiently allocating scarce resources.<p>Not in the case of a monopoly.  Comcast has a monopoly on a large fraction of the broadband market.  They also compete directly with Netflix, so they will leverage that monopoly to make it as expensive as possible for Netflix to continue to compete with them.  This is Comcast creating an artificial scarcity of paths from Netflix to Comcast&#x27;s customers.<p>On another note, I have referred to Comcast subscribers as &quot;customers&quot; above; if agreements like the above continue, then Comcast subscribers are no longer customers, but rather the product that Comcast charges for efficient access to.",1398406259

As you start doing something like a peer in every browser that opens your app, you need to provide it only with the part of the database. This filtering should be done two-way (what’s allowed to read, what’s allowed to push back) and is not very straightforward thing to do. It’s not even clear how this thing should be configured. Also server-side lazy loading model won’t work in JS — queries will become async. Given that, server-client communication layer can be implemented, I guess, but it won’t look like anything like vanilla Datomic peer.",1398406226

You could model the timing details of a given CPU and then prove that two assembly language functions were indistinguishable with respect to that model.  (For example, in the case of a comparison function that bailed out early when it found a difference leading to a timing discrepancy, you could replace it with a `for` loop like `for(i = 0; i < size; ++i) mismatch_ctr += src[i] != dest[i]` and then prove that the function takes the same amount of time regardless of whether `src` and `dst` are identical.)",1398405993

Maybe comcast would have more incentive if they had more competition, but they do not, but I think that issue is largely orthogonal.<p>There&#x27;s no clear answer because there&#x27;s a lot of competing and overlapping incentives here.  But at the end of the day, if comcast has to foot the bill to improve quality for netflix customers, how is that fair to comcast customers that aren&#x27;t using netflix?  It is pretty sensible to think that Netflix users should be paying for Netflix service.  If Netflix is selling me streaming video without also having a suitable CDN to get me that video, I suggest to you that they&#x27;ve sold me something they can&#x27;t deliver on.  If nobody can build that CDN because my ISP sucks and makes unreasonable terms, netflix should probably stop selling to users of my ISP.<p>This really reminds me of everyone who was complaining about UPS around the holidays for not delivering their amazon packages in time, even though UPS wasn&#x27;t giving any shipping guarantees due to the peak demand.  Amazon was still providing estimated arrival dates, however, but it turns out those weren&#x27;t based on much (or at least, enough).",1398405675

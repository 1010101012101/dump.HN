But think about who looks up the word ""Sexy"" on a live video stream... I think they're on the right track in some way. Well, I don't necessarily think they're doing the <i>right</i> thing like this, but certainly if you have moral qualms with it, feel free to not use their service. I'm not sure this is a reason to stop using their service. Still, I think it might be better if maybe they had a button that said ""Yes, redirect me"" instead of only waiting five (only five?) seconds. Or, if Justin.tv is really using this to keep bad content off their site, why don't they block those terms completely?

He's still following the Subversion workflow.<p>His article makes it seem like he doesn't have his head all the way around git's internals, but I think his problem with git is a valid one: it makes it _much easier_ to do the wrong thing to the build than the relatively simplistic svn does, and it can be a drag to use tools that make breaking the build quite so easy.  For big team projects it is, in that sense, very much like C programming, and even more like C++ programming: it's a lot of power, but it's way more than enough rope to hang yourself with, or for the guy in the next cube to accidentally hang you with:<p>> ...you need to act differently than you do when you're in an environment that attempts to protect you from your own mistakes.",1234851316

If you take that path, you will be starting at the bottom in your 30s, a decade behind your age cohort, with no savings (and probably a lot of debt).""<p>Good, recent submission on an important issue. Young people seeking advanced degrees should look at what happens to people who obtain the degrees. A lot of young people smart enough to obtain an advanced degree in the humanities would be much better rewarded by doing something else.<p>""As things stand, I can only identify a few circumstances under which one might reasonably consider going to graduate school in the humanities:<p>* You are independently wealthy, and you have no need to earn a living for yourself or provide for anyone else.<p>* You come from that small class of well-connected people in academe who will be able to find a place for you somewhere.<p>* You can rely on a partner to provide all of the income and benefits needed by your household.<p>* You are earning a credential for a position that you already hold -- such as a high-school teacher -- and your employer is paying for it.<p>""Those are the only people who can safely undertake doctoral education in the humanities.""",1234850999

I've been playing with technology since I was 13. I've spent hundereds of hours of my life learning how to program and cooking up small scripts and apps for simple tasks. I've spent sleepless nights trying to get a Linux install working. I've ignored school, college and exams because I wanted to be the first one to solve some programming puzzle online. Why? Because I'm passionate about programming.

6826747,comment,6825551,6825551,1,0,pyalot2,,,"I&#x27;d argue no. It&#x27;s definitely some kind of valuable and/or dense, but it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>The value is purely held up by what value people ascribe to this information. This can change rapidly (and it does), so the precise measure of value isn&#x27;t really known until you actually convert it.<p>If you actually try to convert in a short amount of time, it&#x27;ll rapidly destroy its own value, because the market doesn&#x27;t have the kind of depth to absorb a hundreds of millions of USD conversion, so the only way to satisfy that bitcoin volume would be a rapid drop in price, which would lower the amount of USD in order to satisfy it, or conversely, increase the purchase power of everybody on the market.<p>The true value of this stash is thus, in fact, some fraction of the current valuation of bitcoin. The larger the stash, the smaller the fraction becomes, because the larger the stash, the less able will you be to realize the value.<p>This is the reason the winkelvii are creating an ETF. They&#x27;re sitting on 1% of the coins in existence. An attempt to realize profits would take an extremely long time without moving the market quite adversely. So they need to create a vehicle that allows them to massively increase the market depth.",1385891771

The young men who joined the gang didn&#x27;t have many other options. Most of the men who lived there worked ad hoc jobs. Sudhir Venkatesh coached young drug dealers for interviews (ex: to become a janitor).<p>I suspect that low-level drug dealers start dealing because it&#x27;s easy for them to get into and they don&#x27;t have better options.

I may update it if applicable.<p>Also what you don&#x27;t take into account is that &quot;wage gap&quot; is not an arbitrary measurement. It is picked specifically to make women look like victims. You could also measure &quot;time spent with friends and family instead of working&quot; or &quot;life expectancy&quot; or &quot;probability to die on the job&quot; instead and men would look like the victims.<p>Another thing I wonder is how many of the wage gap studies take into account that typically income in a marriage is split equally. So a woman&#x27;s wage in a job might be less than her husbands, but her effective income is the same.<p>Furthermore, might it be a privilege that women don&#x27;t need to worry about money as much as men.<p>Just a few things to think about. Actually I think statistics like the wage gap are interesting. Something is going on, but it is probably not what feminists think. It&#x27;s worthy of study, but feminism is not open to study or science - the only allowed result is &quot;women are the victims&quot;. Typically the wage gap papers stop when they have identified the wage gap. Then they blurt out &quot;see, it&#x27;s discrimination&quot; and no further investigation is attempted.",1385890222

If we could show that, we&#x27;d have proven the Collatz conjecture. Therefore the notion of asymptotic performance doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense, since we want to give an upper bound on how long the algorithms takes to terminate. However, if we found such an upper bound, it would be equivalent to solving the problem itself, because the runtime depends on how long a given sequence is, and putting it into a closed form.

On the other hand, we still can read the great works of antiquity (from 20 centuries ago) in Latin.&quot;</i><p>Starting as somebody exposed to only modern english, getting off the ground with 17th or 18th century english is going to be <i>much</i> easier than getting off the ground with <i>any</i> latin.<p>Seriously, I&#x27;m not sure what english works you have been reading, but it really doesn&#x27;t get bad until you get really get back into the mid-17th century or so.  Even with 16th century stuff, I would say that most of the difficulty comes from antiquated idioms (and rarely vocabulary).  Trouble you had with scientific papers from the early 20th century probably had more to do with your inexperience with the subject matter of the paper, not the language it was written in.  Books written in the 19th century are still considered reasonable reading for children today (Twain, Carroll, Dickens, Thoreau, etc.)",1385888876

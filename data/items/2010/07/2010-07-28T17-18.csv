1555044,comment,1554656,1554656,0,0,haberman,,,"This Squid vs. Varnish comparison is quite similar to the sync vs. async debate for network programming.  In both cases, the question is: do I use some OS abstraction (Virtual Memory or threads, respectively) as my application's primary scheduling mechanism, or do I handle scheduling more explicitly at the application level?<p>Of course the OS guys like PHK or Linus think you should use the OS mechanisms.  Linus hates O_DIRECT (<a href=""http://kerneltrap.org/node/7563"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kerneltrap.org/node/7563</a>) and PHK is taking a similar tack with this article.  Just let the OS handle it.<p>But there are real downsides to this approach.  One is that it makes you far more dependent on the quality of the OS implementation.  I'm sure PHK trusts FreeBSD and Linus trusts Linux, but if you're writing for cross-platform you might end up on a bad VM implementation.  The last thing you want to tell your customers is that they have to upgrade or change their OS to get decent performance.<p>Also, the OS is by design a more static and less flexible piece of software than anything you put in user-space.  What if you need something that your VM system doesn't currently provide?  For example, how are you going to measure (from user-space) the percentage of requests that incurred a disk read?  Disk reads are invisible with mmap'd VM.  What if you need to prioritize your I/O so that some requests get their disk reads serviced even if there are lots of low-priority reads already queued?  If you've bought in whole-hog into an OS-based approach and your OS doesn't support features like this, you don't have a lot of options.<p>And while it's great in lots of cases that the page cache can be shared across processes, OS's don't have great isolation between processes using the page cache.  If you run some giant ""cp"" and completely trash the page cache, your Varnish process is likely to take a latency hit.  In a shared server environment, you want to be able to draw walls of isolation so that each user gets the resources that he/she was promised.  A shared page cache is hard to fit within an isolation model like this, whereas an explicit cache in user-space works fine.<p>Think about the microkernel vs. monolithic kernel debate.  Maybe monolithic kernels won, but it's still a good principle that if it can be left <i>out</i> of the kernel without loss of performance, it should.  Why is it better to use an interface like VM than to use some user-space library that manages disk I/O?  The kernel's one advantage is that it can handle page faults (and so can make a memory reference into an I/O operation), but that's also the property that makes it difficult to do good accounting of when you're actually incurring I/O operations.<p>One final thing to mention: if you're using VM in this way, things degenerate badly in low-memory situations.  Since the pages of data are competing with pages of the program itself, the program can get swapped out to service data I/O.  If you've ever seen a Linux box thrash with its HDD light flashing like mad, you know how bad things can get when memory is temporarily too scarce to even let programs stay resident.  Using vast amounts of VM exacerbates this, because it makes your programs and your data compete for the same RAM.",1280339415

1555030,comment,1554733,1554733,0,0,startuprules,,,"I would propose that there currently exist a third reality: a combination of the two scenarios described in the comics.  An authoritarian state which restricts materials that are hazardous to the state's health, but also encourages huge debt taking/mindless consumption that zombifies the majority of the population.<p>Case in point: US.  It restricts information that would undermine its authority as the world's dominant power, such as BP spill, bankruptcy of its banks/cities/states, ineffectiveness at resolution in afghanistan, etc. The government offers discounts/low rates for large home mortgages, expensive cars, and big student loans that would shackle the majority of the population in debt chains.  It also condones mindless consumption such as reality TV, sports, celebrity news, and facebook games by not taxing them as addictive hazards.<p>Case in point: China.  It restricts, well, pretty much anything it doesn't want the people to know with the great internet firewall and state news programs.  It also encourages huge risk taking in mortgages, which recently has seen home prices go up to 30X average income.  It encourages its citizens to forget about the abysmal living condition by allowing internet game cafes to spread like wildfire and trapping the players in pointless alternative realities.  So they don't realize they are doing slave labor at $1/day to make ipads.<p>I further propose that this will continue as long as these governments worldwide can keep feeding its citizens at a minimum (food stamps, unemployment benefits, carb/sugar loaded cheap food), while offering cheap, mind-numbing entertainments to keep people at home, so they don't go out and riot on the streets.  They can then keep on taxing/raising the retirement age on the productive workers<p>Until oil is at $150/middle class is wiped out/Iran is attacked/North Korea attacks/US defaults on SS and medicare/Japan defaults on its bonds/food prices double/Israel is attacked/automation renders most of population useless, anyways.",1280339177

A college degree is a specialization. That's why you ""major"" in something. It was never designed to be an extension of high school. So, you should get a degree in something that you are both passionate about <i>and</i>  also accept the limited career paths that come with that particular passion. If the career paths are limited and/or not to your liking, assume that the degree will not help you find a job. You may as well use the money to travel instead.<p>The further you deviate from the career paths that are attached to the degree you obtain, the more worthless it becomes. Attempting even greater specialization along this field of study only <i>enhances</i> this effect; it will not correct it.<p>So, Mr. Masters in English: Why are you not focusing your search on the career paths that are attached to the degree that you have; assuming this is actually a passion of yours, namely teaching and/or writing?<p>Applying for random positions because you figure your degree actually means something is about as stupid as applying to the space program and for all the same reasons. You do not have a catch all pre-requisite. You have specialized training, and you receive little to no benefit over the random person on the street when you are evaluated for suitability to this position if the training isn't aligned with the job you are trying to get.<p>Not realizing this after years and years of education isn't very smart at all, really.

I've had more than one systems person give me the opposite advice, that yes, using the OS's caching layer to do your disk/RAM balancing is good, but you should write into files that are divided on logical boundaries that correlate with how you use the data. Their argument was that this gives the caching layer more information, e.g. it can consolidate all your tiny objects into one part of the cache to avoid your small objects unnecessarily pinning a ton of VM pages, and can do things like prefetch pages when you start to read a big object, or even choose not to load a very large object into the cache at all if you're reading it sequentially (keeping it from clobbering the cache). When evicting pages it can also take small-versus-big-object and these-pages-go-together issues into account, as opposed to all pages looking alike.<p>That's all hearsay, though, and I have no idea if it actually improves things in practice on current OSs or with which kinds of workloads.",1280338488

By high school, sure, there's plenty of room for diversified knowledge of literature and history, but there's also a core of math, logic, and reading that everyone should know.  Why not test this stuff?  Standardized tests are objective.<p>Now, the current system focuses on meeting minimums, and most standardized tests quickly hit a ceiling.  I'd much prefer to see tests that attempt to gage the entire breadth and depth of student learning.  Practically, that's going to require different questions asked of different students, or you'll end up with a 10,000 question exam.  But I still consider it standardized testing.

That is, instead of Varnish being novel and well-optimized, it appears that Varnish is pretty conventionally optimized and Squid is just a god-awful piece of development.<p>As he says, this is a 2006 architecture. VM, cache line-size d working set, MRU scheduling -- this is stuff that's been around for a while. If he were writing this article about a 2010 architecture it would look a bit different. For example, trying to minimize memory access is a laudable goal but in the normal data sets the cache is usually overwhelmed pretty quickly. A 2010 architecture would feature NUMA optimization, although his practice of allocating thread data on the thread stack actually helps this a fair bit (inadvertent?). If Varnish uses threading at a significant level, this kind of optimization is only going to get more significant over time. The modern CPU architecture product cycle goes through a kind of give and take -- it alternates between having just enough fast memory and not enough. Right now, we are just about smack dab in the middle of ""just enough,"" but the next Intel release is projected to move to ""not enough."" Threaded programs in NUMA start to matter a whole lot more on 16, 32, 64 cores.<p>P.S. We actually just ignore 32-bit architectures. Even modern commodity CPUs don't have them and anyone running a server architecture with only 4 GB of RAM has bigger problems than the proxy software.<p>Edit: Just saw antirez's post: very good. The VM architecture is good for general case, but it really wasn't designed for specialty applications. There are many operations that a VM can make if it knows a fair bit about the working set and the memory pattern, but that's not possible in a generic OS VM (prefetching and streaming are big ones).",1280337335

It sounds very much like software improvements played a role:<p><i>""We asked ourselves, ‘What does it mean to build a balanced system where we are not wasting any system resources in carrying out high end computation?’” said Vahdat. “If you are idling your processors or not using all your RAM, you’re burning energy and losing efficiency.”</i><p>From personal experience, the hardest part of dealing with super-high-end hardware is utilizing the capacity that it gives you.  You don't just throw a larger computer at a program written in Blub for a smaller system, and gain instant world-record performance.  If nothing else, you usually have to re-architect your code to match the assumptions of the new hardware.<p>Also, the I/O numbers you're assuming are probably very high:  you <i>never</i> get 100% utilization of a network interface -- 70% is more realistic.  And for a problem like this, you're bounded not by the product of the bandwidth of the pairwise interconnects (i.e. (10Gbps * 52) / 8 == 65GB/s), but the bandwidth of any <i>single</i> interconnect, because you can get to a point where you're transferring most of the data across a few connections.  Also, latency matters a lot, because a small connection latency can easily throttle your overall bandwidth when you're moving lots of small chunks of data.<p>Realistically, these guys probably had something more like 7Gbps / 8 = ~.88 GB/s bandwidth between nodes, not counting latency.  That means that it would take ~1163s to transfer 1TB between any two nodes -- which means that that naive solution (distributed merge sort where the intermediates are transferred between nodes) is already ruled out.  So, like I said, we're back to software improvements, if only to utilize the hardware available.",1280337245

The government wasn't taking something away as much as they were simply not giving the population access to it.<p>Books were essentially like illegal drugs in our society.  The Government had decided they were harmful to the citizenry and attempted to restrict them from coming in.  But it's clearly a fairly minor thing (again equivalent to our drug policy where most personal use offenders get drug treatment rather than punishment).<p>For example, John the Savage is allowed both to quote Shakespeare and to interact with those who come to the reservation.  Yet there's no Government repression and it's certainly not like in 1984 where you get a lobotomy.

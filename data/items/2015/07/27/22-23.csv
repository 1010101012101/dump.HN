9958539,comment,9957232,9958414,0,0,phren0logy,,,"To answer your first question, Cannabis Use Disorder specifically refers to a pattern of use that leads to health problems, disability, and failure to meet important responsibilities at work/school/home. So it&#x27;s not defined by use but rather by consequences of use.<p>Second, there are a number of large cohort studies looking at this question. Here&#x27;s a recent one:\n<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26006253"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26006253</a>\n<i>Psychosocial sequelae of cannabis use and implications for policy: findings from the Christchurch Health and Development Study.</i><p>It followed a group of 1200+ kids in New Zealand for all kinds of stuff, but in this particular paper they looked at cannabis use.<p>Their conclusion:\nIn general, the findings of the CHDS suggest that individuals who use cannabis regularly, or who begin using cannabis at earlier ages, are at increased risk of a range of adverse outcomes, including: lower levels of educational attainment; welfare dependence and unemployment; using other, more dangerous illicit drugs; and psychotic symptomatology. It should also be noted, however, that there is a substantial proportion of regular adult users who do not experience harmful consequences as a result of cannabis use.<p>In conclusion, it seems that some adults can use occasionally, or even regularly, without a problem on one of the outcomes they looked at. Those with a personal or family history of addiction or a psychiatric disorder are probably at higher risk for a problem.<p>But, it comes back the same problem mentioned before: Every study can only answer the narrow questions they have considered, How does cannabis impact the risk for vascular disease, or dementia? Perhaps it helps, perhaps it hurts.This study does not answer that question.",1438037744

Like I said: go on LW and talk about &quot;AI&quot; with assumed context.  It&#x27;s just out here in the rest of the world where you can&#x27;t assume that everyone automatically has read the literature on AIXI/Goedel Machines/etc and considers &quot;agenty&quot; AI to be a real thing.<p>>2) You are currently working on self-improving AI.<p>Hell no!  I&#x27;m working on logic and theorem-proving in the context of algorithmic information theory -- really just dicking around as a hobby.  If you want &quot;stable&quot; self-improvement for your &quot;AIs&quot;, you need that.  It&#x27;s also not, in and of itself, AI: it&#x27;s logic, programming language theory, and computability theory.  And if I get a result that holds up, which is an open <i>if</i>, I&#x27;d be happy to keep it the hell away from &quot;AI&quot; people.<p>The main reason I don&#x27;t consider alarmism warranted about &quot;self-improving AI&quot; (though I don&#x27;t count any of FLI&#x27;s letters as <i>alarmism</i>) is that I think of &quot;an agenty AI&quot; as something put together out of many distinct pieces.  It&#x27;s arranging the pieces into a whole and executing them that&#x27;s unsafe, but also currently prohibitively unlikely to happen by accident.  Naturalized induction and Vingean reflection wouldn&#x27;t be <i>open problems</i> if self-improving &quot;agenty AI&quot; was <i>so easy it could happen by accident</i>.<p>I fully agree that one <i>does not build a self-improving agenty AI under basically any circumstances, ever, even if there&#x27;s quite a lot of guns to your head and various other unlikely and terrible things have happened</i>, as the research literature stands right now.",1438037717

9958522,comment,9955086,9957312,0,0,Thriptic,,,"> Government is often quite efficient. For example, public health insurance has smaller overhead (like five fold less) than equivalent private products.<p>I don&#x27;t have the numbers so I can&#x27;t speak to the overhead, but I can point at the VA health care system as a counter to your statements about government health care being efficient.<p>> The entire NIH budget produces prodigious amounts of research, from the basic to the translational, for less than what the entire pharma industry spends just to refine their drug development. The private sector sucks at research spending.<p>There are a number of problems with this argument.<p>First, the NIH can afford to take a shotgun approach to research funding which pharma can&#x27;t take because the risks of loss are so much lower. The NIH can give out large numbers of grants per year, have a large number of them fail to produce meaningful results, and call their work a success as long as some good work is being done. That model is untenable at the major clinical trial level because the losses would be astronomical. It&#x27;s the same reason why the Y combinator investment strategy wouldn&#x27;t work if you wanted to apply it to big private equity deals: You can&#x27;t fail massively more than a few times before you&#x27;re in trouble.<p>Second, the standards for &quot;success&quot; are completely different for drug development and basic / translational research. Most basic research is looking for (at best) proof of concept in an in vitro or in silico model; most translational research is looking for efficacy in an animal model using small populations. A pharma research project has to consider statistically significant efficacy, formulation, dosing, acute and chronic direct toxicity, delivery, off target effects, drug-drug interactions, manufacturing, storage, population differences etc and are held to much higher standards at every stage than your average research lab. By the way, even with these differences in requirements, it is well known that a lot of published, NIH funded research coming out of academia is not reproducible: <a href=""http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/full/nrd3439-c1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v10/n9/full/nrd3439-c1.htm...</a>, <a href=""http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irreproducibility-1.12852"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/news/announcement-reducing-our-irrepro...</a>  If this were to happen in pharma, you would have deaths and lawsuits.",1438037571

9958517,comment,9957232,9958020,0,0,bryans,,,"I&#x27;m finding it very difficult to understand your insistence that all of the currently published research[0] into the benefits of marijuana use is somehow &quot;low quality&quot;, or invalid, or an advertisement, while simultaneously claiming that all of the research into the detriments are completely valid. That&#x27;s pretty silly, and quite the opposite of &quot;remaining free of bias.&quot;<p>If you had stopped at saying we should be wary of touting marijuana as this utopian drug with no downsides, I would completely agree with you. In fact, I don&#x27;t need research to know that marijuana use can be detrimental to health, as I am susceptible to a very extreme form of cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome[1], and have come uncomfortably close to being the first person to die directly from its use. This has led me to actively investigate the subject for years. Experiencing first-hand results which are identical to both positive and negative research, I can&#x27;t help but question the &quot;non-bias&quot; in your approach to the topic.<p>Just because people exploit medical marijuana programs for the purpose of recreation, doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t legitimate therapeutic benefits. The reason why those programs are being so heavily exploited, is that marijuana has long been subject to prohibition in many countries, despite wide acceptance (even among your peers) that it is no more harmful than other legal drugs. Prohibition, of course, has not stopped anyone from growing and smoking it, which is exactly why these medical programs get exploited: they can be. Why go through the hassle of growing and harvesting and curing, or risking fines and jail time, when you can make a trip to a doctor&#x27;s office and lie about muscle pain?<p>Marijuana has also long been subject to many, many smear campaigns[2] from people with zero understanding of the drug. Which ought to tell you that there are likely just as many people pushing for negative research results as there are positive. But that doesn&#x27;t mean all of the negative research is &quot;low quality&quot;, or invalid, or an advertisement, just as it doesn&#x27;t define the positive research. It just means there are a lot of ignorant and greedy people in the world, which I think we can both agree on.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search?q=marijuana&restrict_sr=on"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/science/search?q=marijuana&restrict...</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabinoid_hyperemesis_syndro...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reefer_Madness</a>",1438037505

I drank way too much coffee and didn&#x27;t sleep.  My body has taken a bit of time to adjust back to normal\n3) My development passion increased dramatically doing it.  I had gotten stuck in a rutt before doing it and had no passion for code, i been coding for too long the same old ways. \n4) Paradigms, one of the downfalls of getting more educated is they can sometimes lock you into a way of thinking.  Don&#x27;t become that person, You need to stay open minded.\n5) Money, it was expensive doing masters\n6) Bragging rights, it is sometimes nice to blab on about a masters degree.<p>Would I do it again, hells yes but would I do it when I was a bit younger (I did mine late 20&#x27;s) hells no.  Go out and learn as much as you can working on your own projects or better yet step away from the computer and have fun.  There is more to life than trying to be the best at computing.

In theory, you have a &quot;right to a trial&quot;.  But, of course, we can&#x27;t afford to have everyone who gets a speeding ticket contesting it at trial.  That would be prohibitively expensive.  So instead, the courts impose hidden costs, making it a pain in the ass to go to trial over a speeding ticket.  At best, you win a pyrrhic victory.<p>I would greatly prefer an honest accounting of my actual rights and the costs associated to using them.

If you make Walmart more expensive than Amazon, Walmart will shutter stores laying massive numbers of people off.<p>Yes, that&#x27;s a good reason why we shouldn&#x27;t subsidize capital intensive businesses over labor intensive business by taxing capital income less than &quot;normal&quot; income and then adopting additional taxes on labor income on top of normal income taxes, but should instead treat all income alike for tax purposes without regard to source (and also, therefore, for benefit-eligibility purposes for past-income-qualified benefits for which dedicated taxes on income are taken to fund benefits.)<p>> But this is way outsides of a normal rise in minimum wage.<p>Not really. The article claims that $12 in 2020 would bring it above its 1968 peak level in inflation adjusted terms (the 1968 peak level, $1.60, is about $10.97 now, so $12 <i>now</i> would be a little bit ahead of it, with 2% annual inflation from now to 2020, $12 would be almost exactly the 1968 peak level.) So, a $15/hr. federal minimum wage in 2020 would be a higher-than-historical minimum wage, but <i>not</i> by a large margin.<p>And a little-over-doubling from 2009 to 2020 wouldn&#x27;t be an unprecedented jump over an 11 year period, either (from 1945 to 1956 it got a 2.5 multiple from $0.40 to $1.00 -- and over 12 years, from 1938 to 1950 -- it tripled from $0.25 to $0.75.)",1438035284

The UK produced 3,062 & 5,693 in that same period, that makes them fourth in the world, and they still produce roughly a tenth what we&#x27;re producing in terms of medical R&D<p>...you are seriously quoting patent numbers of massively disparate populations?<p><i></i>Lets try to get this apples to apples:<i></i><p>75,456=32139+43317 vs. 8,755=3062+5693<p>319 million vs. 64 million.

Double for ~23% increase in patents, a large portion of which are evergreen and overbroad patents that the US patent office rubber stamps.<p>> If we nationalize our medical system, yes, we could get prices down too, but we&#x27;d also be destroying the world&#x27;s medicine R&D system in one fell swoop.<p>Not really.

You are looking at a company’s economic advantage,” says Dr. Joel Lexchin, a professor in the School of Health Policy and Management at York University in Toronto, Ontario.<p><a href=""http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/245785-second-chance-for-virginias-senators-and-patients"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/245785...</a><p>> The TPP’s impact on access to essential medicines is alarming and extensive. Leaked texts reveal language that would “evergreen” and extend patents without just cause, enhance the monopoly rights of drug companies, and establish precedent-setting limits on generic medications that impact not just TPP countries, but the region as a whole. These restrictions on life-saving affordable medications in the developing world also threaten access to medications here in the U.S.<p>Those numbers are heavily misleading due to that. The US is actively fighting to extend that and force it on other countries with their trade treaties.<p>> “The response from the brand side is that they are trying to protect their markets so they can further invest in R&D [research and development]. And even if they make a modification to a drug, doctors are still quite able to prescribe the generic version of the older product. Having said that, the brand-name companies put an awful lot of money into marketing the newer version, and that marketing is designed to affect what doctors do.”<p>-----<p>> If China is planning to increase their Healthcare expenditure 10-fold, that will come at the expense of higher taxes, as again, they are not prepared for the private management of infrastructure.<p>...they need to raise it about 3.6% and are currently spending 5.5%.

In this day and age how is it right that a single country can mandate a requirement on every piece of luggage that passes through their airports? It might be a security concern, but there definitely are better ways to deal with this - all other &#x27;first world&#x27; countries in the world do.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure if India, China or any non-Western country did this, everyone would be up in arms about misuse, infringement of rights, etc. And yet when the TSA acts so stupidly (a photo shown to the public) and with multiple incidents of abuse of power from the TSA&#x27;s side, the public opinion is still that the TSA is competent and  well-intentioned.<p>I would call it hubris if they show capability, but this is downright arrogance.<p>I&#x27;m surprised no one is suing the government over this. Or is it like a EULA when you enter the United States that you agree not to press charges on such incompetence?",1441922399

As I plot a million data points, and their various transformations, on my two 4k monitors, zooming in and out, with 3000 more series to go, I ask, what am I possibly looking for here? Then I look at machine learning frameworks which will require multiple GPUs to try to find patterns in my 16 billion historic minute tick data records, patterns which may not repeat themselves at all, I wonder if this article is not prescient: there is a huge danger of getting hypnotised by the sheer quantity of data available to me, forgetting the simpler, more obvious things which I should be mining for first, instead of trying, with huge investment but massive uncertainty, to follow a payoff pot at the end of a massive-data rainbow which may there, but which may be a highly inefficient use of my limited compute, and data-scientist mental bandwidth, resource.<p>As a result of this article I am sorely tempted to trash all my minute data older than 1 year old to a spinning disk archive somewhere, and go to 5 minute, half-hour, 3-hour, stepwise backward each year, then daily averages, for the rest going back to 20 years. I suspect I&#x27;ll get a lot more value with at least an order of magnitude or two <i>less</i> data, simply because it will be so much more tractable.",1441922305

They all fit a certain need.<p>I have one in the garage that I use as a Sonos (whole-house music system) controller and to occasionally look up shop-related queries (IE - &quot;what is the torque spec on the axle bolt for my bike?&quot;).<p>I have one next to the couch that is also a Sonos controller and I use for weather and &quot;2nd screen&quot; duties. IE - &quot;Why does Con Air&#x27;s cinematography style look so much like Michael Bay movies?&quot;<p>I&#x27;ve got one in the home office I use for hacking, many other gadgets I use have tablet-based interfaces.<p>I have a retina iPad on the nightstand for reading, checking the news/weather/sports/social networks and to control my house lights - part of my bedtime routine.<p>My most compelling use though is for when I need a light computer for travel. Two years ago, I went to Hawaii for a week on two carry-on bags (including big camera and diving gear). I had my iPad with me and, while there, work had a serious server outage. I was able to SSH into the server, initiate repairs, and get everything fixed while sitting on the balcony in the sun. I did not carry (and could not have fit) any normal sized laptop in the carry on. I also used to it check out various tourist destinations and find places to eat while I was there (which I could have done on a smartphone, true).<p>I&#x27;m an extreme geek, I have embraced the culture of technology, my house is filled with many gadgets that have served me well and others that have served only to drain my bank account. I have no hesitations about buying something if I have even the slightest inkling that it would improve my life/workflow.<p>In the above, all but the iPads were cheap Android tablets that I dont think I paid more than $200usd for (none of those needs required a whole lot of horsepower).<p>To speak to your specific interest, tablets are awesome for casual web navigation and almost awesome for note-taking. I have yet to duplicate the ease and awesomeness of a pen on paper for note-taking with any tablet app/stylus combo. Many tablet note-taking apps have great features, but the actual &#x27;feel&#x27; of a quality ballpoint pen on wood pulp has yet to be duplicated - for me, I&#x27;ve spent far too much time being &#x27;constrained&#x27; by computers to be able to think as freely as I can with a pen and paper. Switching will almost certainly be a painful adjustment. That said, if &#x27;computers&#x27; are your native medium, then note taking on a tablet can be a powerful thing.<p>For example, Microsoft OneNote is an amazingly awesome note-taking app for computer-savvy folks. They really nailed the balance between digital data entry and analog  notation while presenting it in a fairly intuitive interface. I&#x27;ve only ever used it on PC, I&#x27;d <i>love</i> to see as brilliant an implementation on a tablet. Not sure it&#x27;s possible without a mouse-&#x27;mindset&#x27; interface.<p>Though really, as long as you don&#x27;t need big horsepower and aren&#x27;t on an extremely constrained budget, it&#x27;s not too hard to get your feet wet in the tablet world cheap. I just saw a not-horrible import Android tablet for <$40 on a sale site.",1441921478

By high speed, I mean that you need to process multiple characters per cycle (say a 64-bit word at a time)- if you have to make a decision on a byte-by-byte basis, it&#x27;s too slow.  This is a very possible scenario if the protocol catches on: for example, I made HDLC byte stuffing for PPP framing, 4 characters at a time (at least better than bit stuffing).<p>The CRLF encoding is not so bad in this case: read 8 characters, in parallel detect CR.  If there is no CR in your word, just append the data to the  buffer.  When you do have a CR, it&#x27;s a big pain: you need to save the last word with byte masks, then shift any remaining for the next input (and the entire next string is shifted by this left-over balance).  You could try to make all strings a multiple of 8 in length to avoid this, but this adds overhead to the message so is inefficient- the hardware will just have to do it.<p>OK, so now in your new format the hardware has to parse a variable length decimal number and convert it to binary (ideally in parallel), very fun!  You could make the conversion byte at a time, but it&#x27;s slow.  You need to implement overflow detection.<p>At the very least use hex instead of decimal.  Even in software you may need overflow detection.  This is easy in hex, not so much in decimal.  Better is to require the number to be a multiple of four or eight digits, even though this is a waste of bandwidth.",1441919166

The vast majority of people in human history have been systematically excluded from access to both the knowledge and the material resources needed to carry out this project. If you had the knowledge, you could always build a hut like this — but the neighbors, who are organized into an effective violent force with a hierarchy of coercion, would be likely to raid you and take it away, even though most of them are low in the hierarchy and are therefore not allowed to live in a luxury house like this themselves. Most people still live like that. Now we call the people who do most of the raiding &quot;police&quot;, and they have bulldozers.<p>What? No, there is no need to posit systematic exclusion - keep Hanlon&#x27;s Razor closer to heart. Deliberate destruction of value does happen but it&#x27;s rare.

But if you're targeting, say, a certain subset of baby boomers who may not have upgraded their computers in a while, accommodating 800px might be a good idea.<p>One thing you can do is find a very popular Web site (like at the Amazon / Ebay / Facebook level) that targets the same audience you do and see what they're doing with their design.",1216353452

Nobody said this was the last time, they are doing charity. It is one step at a time. I am sure nobody is helping this child because, his father works on an open source product. If you replace the father with a fisherman or farmer, I am sure people would sympathize the same way and donate the same amount they might be doing now.<p>A Cynic is one who knows the price of everything and value of nothing. - Oscar Wilde",1216353299

They would probably also do better work if they were doing so for their own good. Case in point: Who had more food during the 1950-1980s. The US or the USSR?<p>Point 2: What makes you think that national health care will make doctors magnanimous? Just switching the payer from individuals to the govt. (which gets its cash from individuals anyway) doesn't magically change people. If we get national health care, doctors will probably start doing exactly what government unions have done: invest in lobbyists.<p>PS. The patient is in Ukraine.

I myself have a great deal of interest in knowledge and skill acquisition (in particular, the differences between first and successive language acquisition, but i digress.)  Studying processes and patterns in learning can be a fascinating and deeply enriching experience.  My comment was intended to warn against delving into endless debate over terms.  I see how my (1) was worded incorrectly, instead it should have said something like ""to argue about the emergence of consciousness from the material world and its role on the nature of subjective experience and truth"", which i do believe is not a fruitful discussion.  If anyone has a particularly convincing or useful discourse about the previous I am open to change, but as it stands all I've read on the matter has been speculation and/or justification for some moral or social agenda.",1216350096

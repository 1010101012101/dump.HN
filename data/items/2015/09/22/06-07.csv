So assuming that the FMV of the company for your common stock is about 1/3 of the 40M, and you acquired 3% of that, the government now thinks you just made (40M*0.03/3) = $400k, and they will expect you to pay tax on that as income or AMT in your 2015 return.<p>So unless you have a few hundred thousand dollars lying around, it&#x27;s too late, don&#x27;t worry about it.

Generally if you have the opportunity to early-exercise + 83(b), you should take it if you can afford it - it&#x27;s far, far cheaper in virtually every case, especially for the really early stage.<p>In terms of forward action, you have a few options:<p>1) Do a full (or partial) exercise with your own money, pay AMT on the spread<p>2) Take a loan from someone to help finance the full or partial exercise, let them offset your risk in the short term.<p>3) See if someone (probably an investor, or your former co-founder) is willing to buy your stock back (probably at a discount)<p>4) Do nothing and see what happens over the next few months/years, and only take (a potentially much more expensive, but also much more certain) once the company is reaching some liquidity event (or lack thereof).<p>Here&#x27;s a more comprehensive blog post on startup equity: <a href=""http://www.offerletter.io/blog/201412-understanding-and-negotiating-your-startup-equity.html#section-iso-early-exercise"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.offerletter.io/blog/201412-understanding-and-nego...</a><p>Also, even though they&#x27;re not &quot;your&quot; lawyers, per se (they are the company&#x27;s) you should still reach out to the company&#x27;s legal team to understand your options. And if you have a good, open relationship with the cofounder and/or board, then you have a lot more latitude in terms of next-steps as well - if they&#x27;re doing well they can nicely ask an investor in a subsequent round to give you some liquidity should you desire it.<p>If you really believe in the company, it may make sense to exercise now and pay the taxes, but if doing so requires a meaningful portion of your net worth, you&#x27;ll have to make sure you understand you&#x27;re putting a lot of eggs in one basket. You would basically be going in on an asset that is opaque, and statistically failure-prone. But if you believe in it, it may be worth it. Maybe.<p>Drop me a line [ mallyvai at offerletter dot io ] if I can be helpful here more specifically too.<p>No easy solutions - all have tradeoffs - but it&#x27;s definitely a manageable situation.

Yes, there is an administrative document that asks questions about how such updates are prevented, but if you read the full document in context it also asks a lot of other redundant questions, and the FCC have since responded to Ars questions stating that it was not their intention to ban alt firmwares - just that the administrative processes starting up at the moment probably assumed that it would be necessary for the host device to do this to meet the new requirements. And since when does answering a regulatory compliance question in the negative mean that your application will automatically be rejected? All of the responses are used to help an FCC assessor arrive at a proper conclusion, potentially with further clarification sought on each point - it is not a hard script that you must always answer every requirement in the positive (in fact in many cases this would be impossible).<p>The new regs themselves do not state this requirement. It lists several possibilities for manufacturers to guarantee conformant emissions from their device, several which will continue to allow 3rd-party OS firmware.<p>Admittedly, the brave new world looks like region-locked devices and cheaper routers that truly are locked down in the exact ways we don&#x27;t want, but that is not a hard FCC requirement, just a side-effect of the new regs on APs that have poor separation between OS and radio module.<p><pre><code>    There are plenty of uses for radio software that don&#x27;t involve going outside approved frequencies.\n</code></pre>\nExcept unlike ISM bands, U-NII 5GHz spectrum has been carved up with consultation of the 5GHz primary (licensed) users in each country and granted exclusively for U-NII conformant devices.<p>Unlike 2.4GHz ISM, nothing gives you the right to transmit on 5GHz U-NII bands (well, there&#x27;s a bit that overlaps with secondary amateur spectrum) than otherwise permitted through the same FCC approvals process every device manufacturer must undergo.<p>That was the case before the new rules. Now the new rules are imposing sucky requirements for U-NII device software security.<p>However, that&#x27;s been largely misinterpreted in every discussion I&#x27;ve seen recently.<p>For some context, check out <a href=""https://wirednot.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/what-else-is-in-the-5-ghz-spectrum-hint-its-not-just-weather-radar/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wirednot.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/what-else-is-in-th...</a><p>You really don&#x27;t want U-NII devices configured for Japan to be stomping on licensed spectrum in the US; you also need all that power negotiation, radar/interference avoidance algorithms in your radio so we don&#x27;t get the same 2.4GHz mess happening in 5GHz.",1442904488

When it works well it&#x27;s the most accessible, light-weight, least technical-debt means to online content there is, both for users and developers/publishers.<p>Note that Apple are not allowing developers to write any old add-on for iOS Safari.  Imagine if they opened up add-ons for Safari? That would be worth applauding. We could then fix many of iOS Safari&#x27;s shortcomings, and give it some much needed extra functionality.<p><i>&quot;One more thing about accessibility: iOS is head and sholders above&quot;</i><p>The web has more accessible characteristics built-in because of the way the data is openly available to different clients. Native apps controlled by one vendor like Apple are the complete opposite.

The mathematics statement is that any planar graph can be colored with four colors. Thus, the first part of the “warm up” has a solution; in fact the world map can be colored with four colors. The four color theorem is deceivingly simple- it can be explored by a kindergartner, but it turns out to have a lengthy proof. In fact, the proof of the theorem requires extensive case checking by computer. Not every map can be colored with three colors (for an example illustrating why see here). It is therefore natural to ask for a characterization of which maps can be 3-colored. Of course any map can be tested for 3-colorability by trying all possibilities, but a “characterization” would involve criteria that could be tested by an algorithm that is polynomial in the number of countries. The 3-colorability of planar graphs is NP-complete.<p>This is the background and context for the problem for kindergarten.  It would be good if educators and writers could provide a version of this for young children and their teachers.",1442903211

I&#x27;d like to see it...\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s the very same document - I&#x27;d encourage everyone to read it in full. There are only 3 pages of content after all: &quot;Software Security Requirements for U-NII Devices&quot; [1]. But keep in mind - this is not representative of the actual license conditions and regulations, it is a piece of bureaucratic administrivia that helps the FCC staff process and assess your applications!<p><pre><code>    &quot;2. What prevents third parties from loading non US versions of the software/firmware on the device? Describe in detail how the device is protected from &quot;flashing&quot; and the installation of third party firmware such as DD-WRT.&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAgain, I think people are picking stuff at random and missing the context. I could find much scarier wording than this if you really wanted to FUD this up some more. This is part of a bureaucratic administrative process used to help assess applications.<p>It even says that follow-up questions may be asked. As someone familiar with regulatory compliance processes in another country (.au), just because you answer in the negative does not mean your application will be rejected - your other responses (see the <i>rest</i> of the questions to see how redundant they are) will be taken into consideration.<p>Even though we have the old joke where our equivalent of the FCC has an unofficial motto, &quot;We&#x27;re not happy until you&#x27;re not happy&quot;, even bureaucrats have enough imagination to see that scripted questions can&#x27;t capture every single possible way to meet the underlying requirements for a given regulatory compliance issue.<p>The questions are centered around identifying how the device is restricted from operating outside of the conditions asserted and tested in the conformance documentation submitted with the FCC registrant&#x27;s application. That&#x27;s not an unreasonable expection from a spectrum regulator&#x27;s POV, but it is terrifying given that this will likely mean region-locked (or region-specific) devices - choosing a country from a drop-down list will become a thing of the past (after all, 5GHz is carved up quite differently in different parts of the world compared to 2.4GHz, where things are already a complete mess).<p>Whilst you might find that &quot;OMG, these questions seem to assume that the FCC wants only OEM-approved firmwarez&quot;, as per the DD-WRT wording this is because the questionnaire has been written from the assumption that these drastic measures are necessary to meet the new regulations. If you read the proposed regs themselves, carefully [2], I don&#x27;t see anywhere where the &quot;host device&quot; is explicitly required to control OS firmware <i>unless this is the only means that the registrant can meet the U-NII security requirements</i>.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that we have a whole new population of people trying to read and understand these documents (me included). They use the term &quot;software&quot; rather loosely, and you have to have some background understanding of how the existing FCC registration/approval/certification process works (difference between an approval for a host device vs module etc).<p>I even see people mixing up the SDR rules. Technically an SDR product must undergo a completely new FCC approval process with new validation test results/proof of conformance for every firmware update! There&#x27;s no way WiFi router AP vendors are going to go down that path; this is reserved for things like mobile phone baseband firmware that change infrequently and are profitable enough (check out Qualcomm&#x27;s profits) to actually afford to be able to do this.<p>This [2] basically summarizes the intent behind the U-NII security requirements:<p><pre><code>    Manufacturers must implement security features in any digitally modulated\n    devices capable of operating in any of the U-NII bands, so that third parties\n    are not able to reprogram the device to operate outside the parameters for which\n    the device was certified. The software must prevent the user from operating the\n    transmitter with operating frequencies, output power, modulation types or other\n    radio frequency parameters outside those that were approved for the device.\n    Manufacturers may use means including, but not limited to the use of a private\n    network that allows only authenticated users to download software, electronic\n    signatures in software or coding in hardware that is decoded by software to\n    verify that new software can be legally loaded into a device to meet these\n    requirements and must describe the methods in their application for equipment\n    authorization.\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://apps.fcc.gov/kdb/GetAttachment.html?id=1UiSJRK869RsyQddPi5hpw%3D%3D&desc=594280%20D02%20U-NII%20Device%20Security%20v01r02&tracking_number=39498"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apps.fcc.gov/kdb/GetAttachment.html?id=1UiSJRK869Rsy...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=9a15d7771edde76916923037f790b75d&ty=HTML&h=L&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt47.1.15"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&SID=9a15d7771e...</a><p>Edit: I guess you meant the Ars article!

And in practice what this meant is that they can get it inspected and repaired by third-parties should they want to do that, which means longer lifecycles and cheaper service, among other side-effects that come as a natural consequence of actually owning things, a freedom that is essential for the proper functioning of capitalism itself.<p>But now with the advent of software in these computerized cars all of that is about to change.

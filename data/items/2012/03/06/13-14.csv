That's why there are so many different ORM layers and databases classes and templating frameworks.  For example PHP gives you the nuts and bolts to put together a database class, but there still isn't a good, reusable library I can plug in to my next web app without having to mess with details like handling exceptions for update operations and so on.  (PDO is close but not there yet.)<p>Instead of centralizing a bunch of 3rd-party packages, PHP might better benefit by putting together a cleanly designed, optional, STL-like layer on top of the exposed nuts and bolts.  Something like the powerful classes .NET provides.  That way, a person could point to the official, well-documented, core-supported way of doing something like querying a database or subtracting two date objects instead of pointing to yet another ""ultimate"" PHP extension repository, maintained by who-knows.  It might include things like rich database encapsulation, clean and obvious escaping of output for PHP's built-in template functionality, better datetime classes, and so on.<p>SPL is kind-of-sort-of heading in that direction, but right now it's more for things like iterators and lists--still nuts and bolts.  PHP is building some of the stuff I described into the core--there's an equivalent DateTime class now, though it's still in its infancy, and PDO is getting closer and closer to being a pluggable database object.  But we've still got a long way to go.<p>End the need for massive 3rd-party extension repositories and frameworks by building the necessary basics into the core.  My dream would be to be able to have a PHP object library like the .NET ones.  (Just the basics--DateTime, String, etc., not nightmares like DataGrid.)  But I suspect PHP is too weighed down by its syntactical baggage and twisted history to be able to rise up to that dream.",1331040679

If he was writing a popular technical blog on top of his work then I'm sure I would have.<p>Of course that is not to disparage his work at all, there are many people who do extremely impressive, valuable things but receive little fame. Even amongst educated people you would probably struggle to find someone who could tell you who invented the combustion engine (Étienne Lenoir) but I'm sure many could name the members of the latest fad pop music group.<p>It's just that some people are pushing into the spotlight more than others, or more likely they get there on purpose.

I had been writing a little with a friend, using whatever crap equipment we could afford, the results weren't amazing but we were having fun and staying focussed on the music itself.<p>Then we starting recording other people. I became obsessed with gear, software and all the associated toys that go with any technical pursuit. I'm a programmer, so it's easy to understand how that happens but I totally lost sight of the music, spent way too much money and equipment that was nowhere near being required and generally lost the plot. I was tracking everything 24-bit/96kHz and bemoaning the loss of quality when I mixed down for CD.<p>Anyway, the TL;DR version of what followed was that we recorded quite a bit, lost interest in making our own music and then the whole adventure came to an end. Now my gear is leaving via eBay and I'm finding my way back to just playing guitar and trying to write good music.<p>24-bit/192kHz - pointless.

3670848,story,,,1,0,Wizzard8,"Ask HN: Leadership Trends in Software Development/Entrepreneurship",,"Good Morning HN Family,<p>As HN is one of the most vibrant, thoughtful, and supportive communities on the Web today I thought I'd bring my research to this forum. I'm currently enrolled in a Professional MBA program at the University of Louisville although I work and have worked day to day as a software development professional for the last 4 years. This discussion will help me greatly in my report out for my Leadership course. But enough about me this question is truly about you all.<p>As I lookout over the landscape of our community (which I believe broadly encompasses: Software Development, Technology, Web Design, Entrepreneurship, etc.) I tend to notice a trend in our leadership. For the most part those we consider leaders in our community aren't the gentlemen/women doing the most hand-waving and evangelizing about what they support, instead they are often some of the more thoughtful, brilliant minds, and thought leaders in our community whom we respect for their talent. Although we have our various camps and flame wars I think largely my previous assertion rings true.<p>What I'm curious to understand, and hopefully the HN community can help me further develop this thought, is why doesn't this same trend tend to transfer well into other industries (i.e. Politics, Civic Organizations, etc.)? I realize this is a very broad stroke I'm painting here but I believe this holds generally. As a corollary, do you all think that this trend is truly reflective off our community? Do you think it (i.e. our typically higher levels of rationality) gives us a potential sustainable competitive advantage with respect to other industries moving forward? Other thoughts?<p>Thanks in Advance for your time and support!",1331040066

The poor deserve to die; the rich deserve unmediated power.<p>This is nonsense, it would be like me claiming that bastiat and hobbes were just spinning the same tired old bullshit that statists had always spun before, attempting to push forward with the divine right of kings idea as justification for totalitarian states, and if we don't accept their logic we'll all just devolve into a state of eternal war amongst all humans.<p>You could make that argument about those positions, but in doing so, you make it clear that you're not attempting to accurately portray anything bordering on nuance, you're just trying to join a chorus portraying them in the worst possible light.<p>Politely responding with ""Well don't you think you might actually have missed this little point here on the side"" is to validate the position being offered as if it had any kind of bearing on reality. It's simply not an appropriate response to this kind of reality warping polemic.",1331038977

Higher sampling frequencies do add to the sound, but in a way that is almost invisible to the untrained ear.

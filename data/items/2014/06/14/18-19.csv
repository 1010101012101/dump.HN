7893363,comment,7892904,7893269,3,0,lomnakkus,,,"I actually tend to think that this kind of shows the folly of single-dispatch OO in general (prototypical or not), in particular its focus on privileging the first parameter syntactically. The problem here is essentially that a freestanding function looks and thus (subjectively) &quot;feels&quot; different from a method. The syntax is obviously slightly different: &quot;myArray.last()&quot; vs. &quot;last(myArray)&quot;. The latter stands out as slightly &quot;alien&quot; when compared to the other methods on Array.<p>Why should the first parameter be privileged? Why isn&#x27;t it possible to add a new method to, say, Array which is scoped to your lexical context?<p>Even classic procedural programming didn&#x27;t have this problem (as long as you don&#x27;t need access to private data): Just add a function that does what you want and it&#x27;ll look and behave just as the other functions on Array.<p>EDIT: Maybe the focus shouldn&#x27;t be on adding a few convenience methods here and there, but rather on making the language itself more &quot;pliable&quot; or &quot;growable&quot; as Steele would probably say.",1402772020

7893330,comment,7893158,7893282,2,0,hyperbovine,,,"No, it does not. You still need a wetlab to do sample preparation. There are a couple reasons why this is exciting though. Oxford Nanopore has seemed like bogus vaporware for several years now, and many people were skeptical that they had a viable product. This data release is the strongest suggestion yet that the thing actually works (but is still in no way conclusive). Two, assuming it does work, being able to sequence 5-10kb fragments will be a game changer for decoding complex structural variation and repetitive regions of the genome. Current sequencing technology (read lengths on the order of 100-200bp) is simply not up to the task, and yet tons of interesting phenomena are believed to be hiding out in those regions. For example, there is mounting evidence that telomere shortening is strongly associated with aging. Existing NGS machines are powerless to interrogate telomeres in humans, because they consist of several kilobases of the repetitive sequence TTAGGG. If Oxford Nanopore&#x27;s claims hold true you could in theory sequence the whole thing in one go. Being able to do this would advance our understanding of aging by leaps and bounds, I suspect.",1402771088

There are of course many other websites that think they must follow the law and add such warning but so far the warnings have been smaller and less intrusive.<p>Is there any way to stop this? Every time I&#x27;m visiting any blogger.com hosted blog or open my gmail - it&#x27;s there. Topbar has two choices &quot;Learn more&quot;, &quot;Got it&quot;. But &quot;Got it&quot; is not persisted.<p>To think that all websites would get this non-persistent topbar warning at one point is beyond logic.<p>Is there any extension recommendation or how are you people coping, isn&#x27;t it driving you mad? ;-)",1402769052

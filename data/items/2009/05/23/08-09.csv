Many people don't, for various reasons, though I'm not among them...I think he's usually extremely nice to the folks he ought to be nice to: small, early stage, startups; and harder on the folks that are able to defend themselves, like well-funded startups and Google and Facebook.  Sure, he's made a few douche moves over the years, like laying the blame for the financial crisis on a bunch of kids who went to Greece for vacation and made a music video, for example.  But Arrington and TC aren't in the habit of just making stuff up.",1243068675

We know what's on page A1 -- it's the big story that everyone would hear about even w/o journalists.  But the stuff that is buried is where the paper pats us on the head and says ""let someone else worry about that little detail"".<p>I'm thinking of trying to figure out a way to make some sort of tag cloud view based on the above -- maybe showing ""important"" stuff on the left and ""unimportant"" stuff on the right.  Both statements are equally significant and subject to the same editorial discretion.",1243065655

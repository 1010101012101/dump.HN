5011288,comment,5010900,5010900,1,0,hello_newman,,,"I totally know what you are talking about dude, I am in the same boat.<p>I was going to my local community college (over 26k students) to get an AA in Business and wanted to transfer. The college (like most in California) was impacted because of the sheer amount of students so getting the necessary classes was getting harder and harder. I am not sure about other CC's but this one (one of the biggest in Orange County) had a feeling of ""high school part two"" type of atmosphere. There was a feeling of its ok to take as long as I want in school....because I am in school, without getting on with your real life. I talked with other friends at other colleges and they said the same thing. It seems like our peers use college as a way to have a sense of achievement while still acting like they are in high school. That's just personally not for me.<p>In high school i started an ebay business which led to a fine jewelry website which i ran for a couple years. Then in college I started a skin care company, flipped the inventory and made some money. I then got another idea, taught myself some programming and got accepted into dev bootcamp. I'll be attending either the Feb 18th or March 11th cohorts once I get a small loan. I then decided to drop out because I got so fed up with the college climate. My thinking is I can always go back...college isn't going anywhere.<p>My suggestion would also be don't worry about companies that hire based on education. Why would you want to work there if they wouldn't even talk to you without an education? I can't personally speak for the tech world, but in general you don't ""need"" a degree...it's a great fall back but if you know your shit why does it matter if you have a piece of paper to prove it?<p>Why not continue to work where you are, save some money, and start a start up or apply to an incubator? Team up with a couple of friends and get something going.<p>At the end of the day, no one can tell you what to do other than you. I dropped (instead of doing the part time route) because I am a firm believer in the ""burn your boat"" (the boat being college) methodology. You make some great decisions when you have no other back up because your current situation has to work.<p>You seem like a smart dude who knows where he is going. You really just need to think about what it is you want and what is right for you. It took me a few weeks of constant, gut wrenching, inner monologue talks to finally drop but the pros of dropping out weighed the cons.<p>Hope some of this helped. I was (and am) in the same boat. It was a hard decision, but for me once I burned my boat and realized what I wanted it was very liberating.<p>Best of luck",1357354737

If Google cared about keeping users tied to Chrome, I suspect they would do more to discourage use of their greatest competitor's browser (Safari).<p><pre><code>  > Let's take Google Chrome's NaCl. It's eerily

</code></pre>
The difference between ActiveX and NaCl is that ActiveX can only be used on IE and Windows, by design, but NaCl could be implemented by any browser vendor and run on any OS (so long as the user has an x86 processor).<p>Also, NaCl is more of a prototype than a marketed product. Its obvious potential security issues prevent a more widespread adoption, and criticism from Mozilla (et al) are generally more on the technical aspects. The underlying goal of being able to safely execute native code is extremely important to the continued development of browsers as general-purpose operating systems (a goal I personally disagree with, but whatever). Someone needs to figure it out, and having an early first step proposed as an open spec is a good start.<p><pre><code>  > Or how bout Dart? Let me rush out and build my next

</code></pre>
I don't even know what you're arguing here; if NaCl is a prototype, then Dart is a tech demo, and one not even officially developed by Google. Chrome doesn't support it, and probably never will. You're essentially complaining that Google allows its employees to work on personal projects related to web browsers.<p><pre><code>  > There are some good things (WebM, SPDY) that have come

5011153,comment,5010071,5010608,16,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Could you explain how Lisp can be simple and powerful?</i><p>You've asked a profound and important question, not so much about Lisp as about systems in general. A system is simple when it doesn't have many pieces. But if the pieces it starts with are very general, and the system provides good ways to put them together, then you can build complex things out of a tiny initial set.<p>Think of a classic Lego set. There are only a few ""primitives"" (different kinds of Lego piece). And there is an easy and standard way to put them together. Starting from these simple initial conditions you can construct very complex structures. Lego is simple and powerful at the same time.<p>How do you build a complex Lego structure? You start by putting a few pieces together to form a cluster. And then you make a second cluster and you join the two clusters together to make a third, and so on. The critical property here, the reason why Lego stays simple all the way, is that the ""operation"" you use to join two clusters is exactly the same operation you use to join two individual pieces  you interlock their knobby bits. In this sense your clusters are still ""Lego pieces"", just custom ones that didn't ship with the initial set: they still have knobby bits suitable for joining up with any other piece. This quality is sometimes called ""regularity"", meaning that the initial properties of the system are preserved as you put things together into ever more complex forms.<p>Suppose that weren't the case and that each time you reached a certain level of complexity you had to learn a new technique for building further. That would make Lego much less simple-and-powerful. You could still build complex things, but it would be harder and more complicated. And there would probably be a bunch of things that, while you technically <i>could</i> build them, it would be so hard and complicated to do that nobody would bother.<p>Programming languages also consist of a set of initial pieces and ways of putting them together. But most languages don't have the quality of regularity that Lego has. Their initial pieces aren't universal enough to get away with having only a few, so they need many more of them, and that means they're not simple, and that means they're not simple-and-powerful. There are, however, a few programming languages that do have this regularity. Lisp is one of them. Smalltalk, Forth, and APL are others.<p>The really interesting thing is that this kind of simple-and-powerful system enables you to do qualitatively different things as complexity grows  not because other languages <i>can't</i> do them, but because they make it too much trouble to bother. For example, because Lisp programs are Lisp pieces in the same sense that Lego structures are Lego pieces, it's easy to write Lisp programs that take other Lisp programs as their inputs and do meaningful things with them. That is a powerful technique, and because it's so easy, Lisp programmers exploit it heavily, more than is practical in most other languages, and that means they can do more with less.<p>This quality of simple-and-powerful is in my view very important and underutilized for managing software complexity. We don't yet understand it all that well, because the programming languages that achieved dominance to date don't have it.",1357352492

Within my controller, I set $scope.username to ""alex"" and this will update any HTML bound to the value ""username"", within the scope, to ""alex"". Similarly, I can set, say, $scope.settings = {user: {username: ""alex""}} and this will update any HTML elements (within the scope) bound to settings.user.username to ""alex"".<p>These are very simple examples, but they show the beauty of having plain JS objects as your ""models"".",1357351913

5011102,comment,5010891,5011029,7,0,benesch,,,"Not a Google engineer, but I can offer a partial explanation.<p>As you probably know, up until the release of IE9, supporting apps across the major browsers (Safari/Chrome, Firefox, IE) was a massive PITA. Not just obscure features, either; even IE8 had some crippling misunderstandings of the CSS 2.0 standard (floats). Today desktop cross-browser problems are consistent subpixel antialiasing and less-critical CSS features like border-radius support, so it's pretty easy for an app to [mostly] work in every modern browser without testing. Plus computers are fast enough that you don't [hardly] notice IE10's stupidly slow JS engine.<p>On mobile, that's not the case. Web-based Google Maps taxes my iPhone 4S Safari to the limit. It's so jerky it's hardly usable. V8 (Chrome's JS engine) is faster, so Android users might have more luck, but you're pushing your phone's hardware regardless. I haven't had the misfortune of owning a Windows Phone, but knowing Microsoft's previous disregard for standards, there may be some significantly broken features of IE10 mobile (though it supposedly supports HTML5 to the same extent as its big brother). At the very least, IE10 sees fairly significant lag with a few tabs on a recent desktop computer; I imagine JS performance on a phone is horribly unusable for an app like Google Maps. Optimizing JS for IE10 mobile could be a non-trivial task with diminishing returnsit might not even be possible to get it to run acceptably.<p>So there's a chance that capturing the 2% of the mobile market on Windows Phone isn't cost-effective for Google. It's probably political thoughdemos of IE Mobile have looked decent.

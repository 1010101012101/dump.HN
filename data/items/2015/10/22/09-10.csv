To ensure that nothing else is messing with these results, eg. that there&#x27;s no signal travelling between the particles, we can move them very far apart and arrange that each measurement takes place at almost the same time; that way, if any such signal existed, it wouldn&#x27;t have time (even travelling at the speed of light) to allow the first measurement to influence the second measurement.<p>Importantly, each person doing the individual measurements has no idea what the other person&#x27;s result is. They only know what they themselves have measured. In order to compare the results, the experimenters must either meet to compare notes, or send a message (eg. via radio) telling the other. Hence, <i>even if</i> the entangled particles interact instantaneously, there&#x27;s no way to <i>use</i> the result of a measurement without waiting for that subsequent radio message from your collaborator, and that message will only travel at the speed of light. The quantum interaction has not sent any <i>information</i> faster than light.",1445507548

Watch Feynman&#x27;s videos about it (or just read his book called <i>QED</i>) if you want clarification, but I think it&#x27;s best to for the most part think of the particles described in particle physics as <i>particles with special rules and behaviors that wouldn&#x27;t make sense if they were just tiny spheres</i>, avoid thinking in terms of &quot;waves&quot;, and learn about those special rules as you can. Anyway one way you can think of the direction is that it&#x27;s on the most probable path based on the weighted sum of all possible (even absurd) paths through the local area, see  <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_integral_formulation</a>.

But, and perhaps this is unfair, it&#x27;s starting to feel like there are too many denials here for all of the accusations to be wrong.<p>> Theranos has reportedly dialed back its 240 blood tests to just one. According to the Wall Street Journal, a source close to the matter told the paper that Theranos has caved under regulatory pressure from the Food and Drug Administration and has stopped collecting drops of blood for all but one of its tests. [...]<p>> “We’ve been transitioning to the FDA system voluntarily. As of right now, we’re only using it for the one test,” Holmes told Bloomberg.<p>This answer could be deceptive. &quot;Transitioning to it voluntarily&quot; could mean anything from that they made decision on their own, to that the FDA has declared its intention to file a lawsuit against them to get them to stop, and they caved to that request, and no lawsuit has been filed yet. (They have not yet been compelled to, i.e., it is voluntary). Meanwhile there are claims that the FDA has concerns and conducted an unannounced inspection. I don&#x27;t think Holmes has claimed that no such inspection has taken place.<p>On the other hand, similar publications have published hatchet pieces against companies I&#x27;ve worked for that advanced one point of view strongly without any balance or contrary point of view, all while doing a very good job of <i>seeming</i> balanced and reasonable. So, who knows.<p>I wonder about one aspect: why does Theranos bother with venous draws if the only thing they do with that blood is put it through commercially available machines? They&#x27;ve just said that the unique service that they provide is by thumb prick only. So they&#x27;ve wasted a bunch of money on equipment and process for lab results that are just the ones that are already commercially available. Why bother? I imagine they must have had to purchase some equipment just to perform their own experiments on their testing methodology, versus existing methods, but why go into commercial operation? There must be a different scale of capital and operating costs involved in that. As an investor, it&#x27;s not where I&#x27;d want them to focus unless there was a good reason, yet it sounds like it constitutes the vast majority of their current business.<p>Perhaps it is a strategy to build up their brand somehow?

There are already strong explicit indicators for the worth of a publication. If a paper comes from a university, for example, you can likely already be assured that it&#x27;s worth reading. If it has a name with good reputation on it, that&#x27;s an even better piece of evidence. If a paper has interesting content, it will be shared in the community. Also, Google isn&#x27;t just ranking by a explicit measures, but mostly by PageRank, i.e. a measure how how well a certain item is woven into the network of links (plus possibly hundreds of heuristics). PageRank could likely be applied to a publication system as well. In that case the network links could be co-authorships, associations with accredited universities, and perhaps other things. And let us not forget that the vast majority of researchers are actually truth seeking and concerned about the impact they make on the world. Things might become a little bit noisier, but at the same time the feedback-loops become shorter, as we&#x27;re seeing it in the machine learning field.",1445504498

This way you don&#x27;t need to listen on a new port and update nginx config (potentially once for each upstream web server).<p>I submitted a patch to gunicorn just this week about this: <a href=""https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/598"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benoitc/gunicorn/issues/598</a>.<p>Ideally I&#x27;d love to see all server software that listens on a port have a SO_REUSEPORT option for hot-swapping. This feature makes operations so much simpler.",1445504446

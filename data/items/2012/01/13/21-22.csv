From Amanda's comment: <i>""Today I called a Senator’s office for the first time.""</i><p>What that says for the first time Amanda is engaged in the question of who best represents her views with respect to how we are governed. This is a great news. As other folks have pointed out this guy has been in office since 1975.<p>So many US citizens walk into a voting booth with a sort of half-baked, maybe completely unbaked, idea about what they are doing there. Worse, anywhere from 20 to 85 percent of the people who registered to vote don't even bother walking in and voting!<p>The people who walk in with no prep at all are the most malleable by advertising of the ""me good! him bad!"" type. They form a sort of Gaussian foam distribution of votes where the investment in advertisements can push the median slightly over to one candidate resulting in elections which are won with 1 - 5% of the votes cast.<p>The ""system"" that was set up was designed for people to actually invest time and effort into identifying the best candidate out of the available choices, and if unhappy with those choices providing a new candidate the next time which was a better choice. But when people don't vote or vote randomly, <i>they fail that system</i>.<p>You can proactively improve the system with a simple algorithm,<p>1) Vote - this is required since the system only responds to votes cast, not blog postings or public outrage.<p>2) If you like the way this office is working, vote the incumbent, if you don't vote anyone else.<p>As the algorithm takes effect, the only successful response of the system is to act in a way such that the voters 'vote incumbent'. The amazing power of this algorithm was demonstrated in Russian elections where the media suggests it took large, overt, and fraudulent activities to overcome all of the votes for someone other than Putin. Had those people just 'not voted' it would have not had the effect it had.<p>So if you want better politicians, vote. If you want to magnify your impact, get as many friends as you can to vote. If you don't have time to research candidates and talk to them to converge quickly on a solution, then use the above algorithm to evolve better representation.<p>The common theme though is this <i>participate.</i>",1326491974
3462583,comment,3461728,3462532,10,0,jquery,,,"> I think that's because university teaches abstractions and pretty much nothing else.<p>Maybe my CS degree was unique (I don't think it was), but at the 400 level we had specialization choices including security, graphics, web development, databases, operating systems, embedded, software engineering, etc.<p>> A project that is done in the average CS class will be presented as a way to teach a design pattern rather than teaching how to solve a problem.<p>Design patterns != algorithms. My professors actually spent precious little time teaching me how to program, most of that was self-taught. What they taught me to do was how to solve problems, and that education has been <i>very</i> useful.<p>If your CS professors are spending most of their time teaching you design patterns, you should ask for a refund. The only CS class that taught me design patterns was my 400-level software engineering course.",1326491949

To say ""I know everything there is to know about programming"" after programming for a year is laughable.<p>You're right that if you know C++ and you learn Java, you're not really learning all that much.  But if you've spent your entire life programming in those types of language, and then learn Lisp, or Forth, or even just assembly language, your entire mental model of computation is turned on its head. Heck, learning C would be an eye-opener for someone who has known only Java.<p>You can go even further. My own trade is ASIC verification - writing testbenches to test functional correctness of chip designs.  I've done a bit of FPGA design, too.  I've chatted to software guys far above my humble skill level who don't grok either of those two domains because they're completely foreign to their way of thinking.  But I'd file both under the broad umbrella of ""programming"".<p>I think you can learn <i>constantly</i> for a lot longer than a year or two without learning <i>any</i> new languages or tools, just working on different project, in different domains, using different paradigms.

While I do not know how it will work in this new school, let me offer some perspective as a Stuyvesant alum.<p>Like many have said, it can be possible to have a ""normal"" school with all the usual subjects in addition to a prominent computer science program.<p>Take my experience, for example:<p>Freshman year I learned things like recursion, Scheme, dynamic programming, and cellular automata. Sophomore year, I learned basic data structures and algorithms and wrote a couple of games. Junior year I learned systems programming in C, signals, processes, network communication and wrote a filesharing system. The next semester I wrote a computer graphics engine from scratch --- all the way from line drawing to complex lighting and implementing an animation and scene graph language. I also took the independent research class where I worked on information retrieval research.<p>I am not bragging. This is <i>typical</i> (in fact, many of the projects, or variations thereof, are things that everybody in those classes does). And yet, I still took tons of math, physics, chemistry, european history, american history, classical literature, modern literature, tech shop, architecture, and many other things. This was also typical! Other kids took the same common stuff but instead of so much computer science and math they took special electives in philosophy, literature, history, economics, and so on.<p>You really can fit all that stuff in. Stuyvesant is a great example that you can have a serious, multi-year computer science program and still have more than enough focus on other subjects.",1326489264

I know I've done a good job there when mine solves problems I didn't consciously anticipate.  Again, that took nearly 2 decades from when I first started programming including a lot of reading on good software design, starting in that first year of programming ('77-8) and <i>never</i> stopping.  Heck, the older you are, the more time you've had to read and grok the classics.<p>Hmmm, to finish with a riff on some other observations in this discussion, the normal, <i>average</i> outcome of a startup is failure.  Perhaps one should consider non-normal approaches to staffing, like recruiting one or more grey-beards of the right sort who can save you days, weeks, even man-months of effort on individual things because of their experience.

I head the Mocality team in Kenya...and we did not 'Ochestrate' this. Building a directory in Africa isnt as easy as just going around and knocking on doors. Our success was largely based on our ability to build and maintain a large agent network (15,000+ strong). These agents collect information that forms the bulk of our directory. However, for the agents...work isnt as simple as going around and knocking on doors. A lot of the population is still very suspicious about the internet and new technologies. People have fallen prey to scams for merely giving out their cell phone numbers...people are kidnapped etc.<p>Agents have the task of building trust with business owners in many cases just to extract their correct business details. Convincing them of the 'need' to be online, is not as easy as it seems. To facilitate this, the Mocality team in Kenya spends a lot of time travelling around, holding agent and business seminars and slowly turning our name and mission into something the local business person can trust.\nTherefore...when google launch a new product like KBO into the market, it is quite clear to us in the country, that they would have similar hurdles to climb when recruiting businesses. These hurdles are in some way a competitive advantage to us, as we've already spent tons of man hours going past them. Google would still need to build the trust...and the business owner would need to be comfortable working with them.<p>For Mocality, the businesses trust our agents and we use our agents to introduce products to them.\nTherefore, when google employees/agents call and say that we are working together, they are taking advantage of the relationship of trust we have worked so hard to build...in order to release their product easily into the market.\nHow does this look for us? It's a domino effect...\nOur agents have no idea about the sites business owners call to ask them about, and their confusion makes the business owners suspicious about working with them further...the agents get upset with us for not informing them of new products or partnerships with google, as they are losing livelihoods...and we are left perplexed that a company of the stature like google is blatantly telling lies. Perhaps worse for us here are the allegations being made that we plan to charge Kshs 20,000 for some services...which is way more than an average business would be willing to spend. So...did we orchestrate this? we clearly did not. And as my CEO Stefan said in his blog...we have always been keen to form viable partnerships within Kenya, and google is a company we have looked at working with. So we dont understand why we werent asked about partnership possibilities if they really wanted to use our information. Really encouraged by the massive support we've seen online from so many people so far though. Very encouraging.</i>",1326489050

Have you ever been in a city (e.g., New York) that was experiencing a sanitation worker strike? Garbage-men are easily some of the most important people in a modern society. The guys that empty my building's dumpster change the lives of hundreds of people every day. I can think of quite a few scientists and doctors who would love to have that level of impact.<p>Ditto for building maintenance and cleaning. At one point, my university decided that it could save money by cutting back on cleaning staff. Going forward, they would only come by to empty the trash and vacuum our offices once per month; the bathrooms would get cleaned every week or two, but other than that we were to be entirely on our own. We thought that this would be mildly inconvenient- it was worse. Oh, your office-mate had a banana with their lunch? That peel's gonna be in the trash can for a <i>long</i> time...<p>It turns out that the cleaning people had been changing our lives in numerous significant ways, every day, and when that change <i>stopped</i> happening, we sure as heck noticed. After far too many months, the administration decided that there were better places to cut back, and reinstated more regular cleaning services. And there was much rejoicing.<p>Your life is the way it is because a very large number of people are doing very unpleasant and/or difficult jobs, often for surprisingly small amounts of money. These people are to be honored and thanked at every opportunity, IMHO, and personally I try to as mindful as I can about the numerous and concrete ways that they change my life.",1326488515

3723161,comment,3717422,3717422,1,0,Ron_wayne,,,"Google and Matt Cutts, in general, have a larger problem. Cutts never acknowledges that Google works primarily on the language, which is one of the most complex things the human race has ever come up to. \nAnd though language is always at stake in Google search, I don't see any serious semiotic study in whatever they make.<p>And, apart from that, Google totally sucks on languages that are different than English. They think of a new thing for the English based search and then they'll just propagate it everywhere with no substantial modifications whatsoever.<p>I've got many sites under me, all writing original content. They're not gonna win the Pulitzer, of course, but at least they're edited, accurately followed by teams of human authors that won't even copy PR as a measure to prevent non original contents to appear on the sites. Although all of these things, we got seriously pandalized.<p>The results where we once used to stay atop are filled in many occasions by scraper-sites who steal our contents and rank 2 or 3, sometimes up to 5, positions above us on the SERP. I can't even count the times I filled the anti-scraping form anymore. That's not enough, because many times popular sites rank higher than us just because they're pretty popular, although their contents are horribly written, short, totally uninformative.<p>That happens all the time. You know where we still go pretty strong? On Google News, where the human intervention sometimes really applies.<p>Google should see what's going on everywhere and their insistence on having matt cutts as its only public voice on this huge issue is becoming really frustrating.<p>He ends up looking like a fake good guy, perpetrating the hypocrisy of a corporation too big and too convinced they have the ability to solve all the hyper-complex search problems, laden with human generated unpredictability and the natural human tension towards deception, just with pretty algorithms.",1332151070

Appreciate all the thoughtful comments but would like to address a few:<p>""Sounds like it's a job problem, find another job"" - \nI've had over 6 jobs in my field. The longest for about 3. These patterns are all the same everywhere I go. I am good at what I do and so I join companies with other people like that - that's the only thing in common.<p>""I can't comment because I'm a man so everything I say will be sexist"" - \nNot true. Acknowledge that there are people who feel this way about the industry. Until we can have a conversation about it, it won't change.<p>""It's not a gender problem, it's a culture problem"" - \nNever claimed this was a gender problem myself. The type of work encourages these types of people to congregate. That, in itself, is a problem. We're trying to increase diversity in an environment that is not diversity-friendly (from an interest/perspective.)<p>""Learn to manage your communication"" - \nAt this point, I am a master of working with men, but I have to work so outside my nature. Keep it cold enough so it's not perceived as interest, keep it warm enough so I am not perceived as a bitch. It's a thin line that, to be honest, is exhausting to walk the whole time.<p>""Women don't love CS"" - \nWrong. In my department 80% of women quit after the first few years and most cited social reasons for it. You can take a liberal arts class where you can have intellectually stimulating conversation or you can take a CS class where there is rarely conversation about things outside of tech. I imagine that's hard. I loved CS, but I always needed to get out.<p>""Get outside the work circle and find other friends"" -\nSure, of course I have them, but as startup culture goes you work 9 to 9 sometimes. What are you supposed to do? You spend more of your time with your coworkers than anyone else.

3723100,comment,3720332,3721259,10,0,dsrguru,,,"As a reasonably intelligent reader with no axe to grind (and who, on the contrary, really enjoys reading your essays), I too was under the impression (and had no reason to question it until seeing your comment) that you were arguing that writing is an objectively better medium for conveying what I'll call ponderable information (as opposed to information that would obviously be best transmitted through spoken word, such as ""get me a decaf latte with two sugars"" or ""there's a bear behind you"") than speaking is, and that being a good writer is more important (or superior in other ways besides importance) than being a good speaker.  If the latter was not your intent, please don't kill these four messengers and assume we're just bad at reading.  We're simply telling you that that's how your essay comes across, at least to some readers.<p>This set of posts actually serves as an interesting counterargument to what I interpreted your thesis to be. As I understood it, you feel that writing gives you more time to organize your thoughts, facilitating accuracy and depth more than speaking does.  Good speaking, on the other hand, or at least the kind of ""good speaking"" that refers to being good at captivating an audience, necessarily involves ad-libbing a lot of the details, which means you can't expect to come up with sentences that are as well worded (which usually means as precise or concise) as those you would have delivered in writing.  Therefore, writing is the superior medium for delivering information.  Period.  Speaking is better for things like letting people see you in person (if you're famous) or sometimes better for inspiring people to take action, which you suggest are themselves important, but that speaking is inherently worse than writing for the purpose of conveying information.  Am I correct so far?  I apparently incorrectly extrapolated that you felt that it's intellectually superior to be a good writer than a good speaker.<p>Now what was I talking about this discussion serving as a counterexample to your argument?  Well, first of all, I agree with everything I think you said up until the conclusion that writing is always more effective than speaking for communicating information.  As we saw from this misunderstanding, the written word doesn't provide the author with the live audience feedback that the spoken word does.  If multiple readers are confused, the author has no recourse because he does not know that they are confused.  Thankfully they can now post comments on the Internet. :)  A good speaker, on the other hand, is so in tune with his audience that he knows when they are confused or when his tone seemed misinterpreted, and he can adapt on the spot, providing more examples or changing the inflection of his voice to clarify his tone.  George Carlin, one of my favorite comics, was excellent at crafting his routines, but from what I've heard from people who saw him live, was atrocious at interacting with the audience because his written style didn't allow him to deviate from his script.  Nevertheless, this afforded him the planning and precision of the written word, and it worked great for him.  In fields besides comedy, the written word's advantages naturally win out over the spoken word more frequently, but don't discount good speaking as an effective way to deliver information.  Great speakers sometimes get an audience to understand actual content (I've seen multiple speeches were Bill Clinton did that, as well as several TED talks that did) as or more effectively than great writers do.",1332149366

3723098,comment,3722986,3722986,13,0,slimdizzy,,,"The author dilutes and weakens his argument by bringing up obesity. Whether a 80kg person is 40% fat or 10% fat doesn't matter; the central point is that a person who weighs more, consumes more, and thus ought to pay more. I wish he stuck more to that point instead of running off on the tangent about health and the environment.<p>Friends with whom I discuss this proposal often say that many obese people cannot help being overweight  they just have a different metabolism from the rest of us.<p>To expand on the author's take on why this argument is weak, take for example nearsighted people. Nearsightedness is partly hereditary; similar to obesity, it can be exacerbated by certain choices, but some people are just bound to be nearsighted. Nearsightedness means paying for glasses (at least the deductible) and often paying a huge premium for sunglasses. Simply put: life isn't fair, and people are already paying different expenses just because of conditions they were born with.<p>Tony Webber, a former chief economist for the Australian airline Qantas, has pointed out that, since 2000, the average weight of adult passengers on its planes has increased by two kilos. For a large, modern aircraft like the Airbus A380, that means that an extra $472 of fuel has to be burned on a flight from Sydney to London.<p>That said, is such an initiative necessary, cost-saving, or beneficial to the customer? An Airbus A380 holds about 600 passengers. That comes out to about $0.75 per passenger per 2 kilograms.<p>A pretty average American man weights about 85kg. A very light American man (bottom 5%) weighs about 65kg. A very heavy American man (top 5%) weighs about 115kg. (Pulling data from this chart). This means that the lightest 5% of men would pay about $7.50 less for a Sydney-London flight than average, and the heaviest 5% of men would pay about $11.75 more. On a shorter, domestic flight like Chicago-NYC, those figures work out to maybe a $5 difference in ticket price between a 65kg man and a 115kg man - and that's not even counting in the extra costs associated with spending time on weighing passengers!<p>So with that taken into account, I don't think that this is the best idea. Maybe extremely heavy people who are literally spilling over into the seat next to them should be forced to purchase two seats or upgrade to a roomier first class seat, because it's not fair for the poor guy sitting next to him. But the weight-to-fuel-price argument seems to not be strong enough. Maybe it'll be worth revisiting if fuel prices climb significantly.",1332149308

Any decent scanning app shows the QRs content before asking the user to act upon it. Who would want an app that instantly saves a vcard to their contact list, or opens a url as soon as they scan it?",1332148096

The first and most obvious use is as a replacement barcode. Add to physical products to expand scanning use-cases.

3071498,comment,3071004,3071287,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"That seems awfully dismissive of the situation and people's frustrations with it. Wall Street greed and political corruption do have a lot to do with it. For example, here's an article from Rolling Stone that's probably partly responsible for unleashing a lot of the frustration towards Wall Street: <a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-isnt-wall-street-in-jail-20110216"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/why-isnt-wall-stre...</a><p>Whenever the subject of Wall Street's participation in our economic woes comes up, a few people show up and try to attribute it largely to normal growth/recession cycles, but that doesn't explain why so many of the figures that we're seeing now more closely resemble trends from 70 or more years ago.<p>Lastly: those ""couple thousand college-aged leftists"" have recently been receiving support from a wide variety of other groups. About the best thing you can do for their cause is to continue underestimating them.",1317743977

3071490,comment,3070871,3070871,18,0,hugh3,,,"This is an excellent choice, and (of course) congratulations to the recipients. Their work really did add an extremely significant chunk to our understanding of the universe. And I think it has now been long enough to confirm that their observations really were accurate.<p>It was also, I think, the first scientific paper I actually read -- I did an assignment on it as a callow young undergraduate, and I still remember sitting in Fisher library poring through the text copy of the journal and trying to figure out what was going on.<p>Since the page doesn't actually explain the work, I'll have a go. I'm doing this from memory, so someone correct me if I get something wrong. Basically, they set out to study how the distance of a receding galaxy relates to its redshift (ie the speed at which it's receding). Up to this point we could easily measure the redshift of a galaxy, but not its actual distance.<p>How do you measure the distance to a galaxy? What they did was to look for Type 1a supernovae. This is a particular subclass of supernovae which always have the same luminosity, because they occur when a previously-stable neutron star goes <i>just</i> over the mass limit and becomes unstable. There's a sufficient number of these going off in the universe in any given week that they make a good ""standard candle"", so by measuring their brightness you can estimate their distance.<p>What these guys found was extremely surprising: the relationship between distance and speed was <i>not</i> what we would have expected based on a universe which has been evolving only under the influence of gravity since its birth -- there was an extra term which appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe over time.<p>And that, right there, is an amazing fact about the universe which nobody knew fifteen years ago.",1317743883

But the real fun is in ""synchronized"" keyword of java. You see, in java multithreading is hard, but it is a heluvalot easier than in many other languages, ruby included. If anything, we should design ""Truby"" which is a new languages for multi-threaded ruby. Truby will need syntax for dealing with asynchronous operations. Truby can then remove the GIL and life will be good. The problem is that you take ruby as it is and remove GIL, sure you can get away with things, rewrite libs, etc, but in the end you won't have a really good language for async programming anyways.<p>So yes, just use processes. Once we have a good multithreaded op model without a GIL then we can just use threads. Until then...<p>edit: jruby can get away without a GIL because it relies on libraries implemented in java, which have very little issue writing async code.",1317743140

3071386,comment,3068752,3069072,1,0,dasht,,,"In Berkeley, at least, that isn't the case.   Retail store fronts are zoned for retail use.   For example, suppose that a start-up wanted to take over a vacant retail space, put up curtains on the front windows and door, and not offer any retail products or services to people coming in the front door.    This would not be permitted.  It requires a different kind of use permit.   Retail use in these areas is ""by right"" - the use permit is essentially permanently attached to the property.   An office use would require a variance - possibly requiring a public hearing (and much expense).<p>Berkeley does this because they want the retail corridors to be destination spaces with lots of foot traffic.   Concentrating retail use like that creates a network effect:  while you're downtown buying some stationary, why not get a coffee next door, pick up a book at one of the last standing independent booksellers, pop in the game store to buy a present for your nephew etc.   If retail is shut out by office uses, that network effect is threatened and there is less reason to go buy stationary in the first place.<p>The landlords (some, at least) are saying that part of the problem is the physical structure of this retail space.  A lot of the buildings are quite old.   The retail spaces are ""deep"" -- 50' back from the front of the store, much of which was intended for use as ""the back room"" where inventory would be kept.   Few retailers need that much space.   Modern supply chains reduce needs for extensive inventory.  If a retailer only needs 15' deep of space, it's hard to convince them to pay the same square footage rate for the entire 50' depth.   Additionally, there is less demand for traditional retail at all because more products are bought on-line or at big-box stores elsewhere.<p>My proposal addresses this.  It addresses the lack of demand for retail at all by encouraging cultural use like galleries and artisan shops.  It addresses the ""too deep"" problem by allowing for offices in the back, opening up to cultural use in the front.<p>I <i>think</i> this could be a good environment for start-ups.  If a number of inexpensively sublet cultural up-front spaces were active, it makes for a stimulating and attractive environment for start-up workers.  Meanwhile, the semi-open offices-in-the-back would be more comfortable and interesting than a sterile office-park type office.",1317742830

As someone who got a job before finishing school, I spent the first few years of my career working literally 16 hour days.  I felt the need to prove myself, and I worked hard to do it.  After 3 or 4 years my life changed in some big ways, and the life style started to affect me extremely negatively.  I continued to try to work more hours but I wasn't getting anything more done.  It was like I had no more ambition to work.  On one particular project I hit a big dip.  I became depressed, I started neglecting things like laundry, or brushing my teeth, or eating.  When the project ended, I got some time to recover a bit (but not fully) a year or so later I was on another stressful project.  I think I hit my low during that.  I almost became completely separated from reality for lack of a better description.  I started having deep almost philosophical thoughts about what the point of life even is.  Again my productivity dropped lower (and also my quality of work, and my communication) I tried to make up for it with extra hours, but it only made things worse.  Eventually I quit, and found a better job that has been pretty strictly 9-5.  Additionally I also stopped working on side projects for a while.  I think a really important part is realizing that the situation I was in was not going to get better, and a complete change was necessary.",1317742341

The main problem is that insurance only really works if you can effectively pool risks, and health insurance is difficult to pool risks in unless it's mandatory in some manner.

Disclaimer: I'm just posting his point of view and don't necessarily agree with it despite seeing his side of the argument.<p>My partner (at the time) and I met with him regarding an application we developed during our last year of University that had seen a lot of industry interest during our formal presentation. He wanted to meet with us and discuss helping us market the app because he was close friends with my friend's family and helped students like us previously.<p>His only real question to us regarding the app was our marketing plan. ""Sell it"" is not a very good pitch despite us not knowing what-so-ever what we wanted to do with it (or what we were capable of doing without shooing investors away). He brought up the point that whether we want to or not we should not be giving it away for free. Why?<p>His argument was that if we were to put a few months of effort into development of an app to give away for free we were essentially robbing ourselves. I myself am a strong avocate for OSS and had a hard time agreeing with him, I gave him a perplexing glace in favor of a ""wtf"". He continued by saying that if we were to dedicate that much time only to give it away we were robbing ourselves of those hours of labour we invested as well as preventing any other student/developer/whatever from being able to make a living from the product line. By us giving away something for free that had a real-world value we robbed others from entering the market to make a dollar.<p>His argument was that we <i>must</i> charge something for our work and if we don't want to make any money to give the proceeds away to charity. By doing that we could allow others to enter the market and make a dollar to fuel future efforts and development.<p>Its sort of a funny way to think of things and sometimes I find myself agreeing with him but I'm never certain... I felt the idea of ""free software"" preventing the developers from making their share of the effort is a good example of how his side of things can be right in many cases.<p>Again, not saying this is my viewpoint so don't get all ""up in my grill"" :)",1317740714

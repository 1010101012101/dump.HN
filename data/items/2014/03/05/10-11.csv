Google presents an uncurated (within limits, like DMCA takedown notices, court-mandated filtering, ...) overview of <i>all</i> links out there. To go along with the (strained) analogy above of giving driving directions to somebody&#x27;s house and telling them how to get in: what Google does is provide an atlas, and maybe a way to search therein.",1394016933

It does seem like some of these recent ones in SSL have been found by detailed code review (after years of providing bypasses), but I mean in general.<p>It&#x27;s remarkably hard to find a security problem reading the code unless that security problem is blatantly obvious.  Part of the problem is that code also communicates intent, and security is in part counteracting that intent.<p>Most (more than 90%) of the security problems I found (almost all of which were in open source prjects) started off by observing misbehavior or wondering if I could induce misbehavior.  This works because I would start off attacking an API, not the underlying implementation.  Only after showing the problem would I look at the code.  I think on one case, I was looking at code and thought &quot;maybe that&#x27;s a weak point.&quot;  But in every other case, my testing was fully black-box to start (things later lead to a code audit in several cases).",1394016910

What makes WordPress too heavy in your regard (I&#x27;m a huge fan of WordPress my self, so quite biased), is it the way you use it, or the themes you use?<p>At it&#x27;s base, WordPress is quite simple, and it&#x27;s the themes that define what it looks like and feels like to your users.

It&#x27;s the model already seen in some US states.<p>What is funny is that much of the benefit of an EV is effectively they are a rolling tax-avoidance scheme - in many cases you actually get subsidised for the purchase.  The cost-to-run figures rely heavily on the lack of taxation  to work out better - and this is even more so in highly-taxing regions like most European countries.<p>This is obviously not sustainable once larger volumes of vehicles start to appear on the road.<p>Of course it would make me happy if EVs became popular <i>and</i> avoided getting loaded down with all the other taxes that vehicles currently attract. Because then it would raise the question why all transportation is taxed so heavily.<p>I know I am dreaming, though.  EVs will end up just as taxed as every other vehicle on the road.",1394016652

7346279,comment,7340810,7346009,7,0,stinos,,,"I was in the same boat as you are now. Plus I took other drugs as well from time to time. That went on for 7 years. Looking back at it know it&#x27;s hard to imagine: during 7 years, I think there were only 2 or 3 days I did not smoke (or sometimes ate) weed. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong: I had great fun and ultra creative moments a lot of times, produced quite nice music etc. But just as many times I was just high and not exactly creative at all, rather just laying in the couch like a zombie.<p>And then came the depression and all fun was gone, no matter how many drugs I would take in. Those days I would not even wish upon my worst enemies. They destroy you, and it takes a long time to get all pieces back together properly. Even now, again 7 years later, hooray for the magic number, I still have to cope with leftovers from back then.<p>So here&#x27;s my suggestion to you: don&#x27;t wait until the depression really kicks in, chances are high it will, but just quit asap. I know for a fact you won&#x27;t believe me, neither did I, but it is actually <i>way</i> easier than you think it is (my experience + plus those of two friends). I just quit from one day to the other, never looked back, and the withdrawal effects were pretty mild - even pleasant. Here are some effects of quitting, as you will notice most are extremely postive.<p>- for a month or so I had a huge urge to be &#x27;active&#x27; because I felt like I had tons of energy that had nowhere to go. Running biking, whatever. Sometimes I would just go out at night and climb trees. For fun. Didn&#x27;t do that since I was a child.<p>- you start to remember things. Randomly. From your childhood, from a couple of years earlier, ... It&#x27;s weird. I never knew where and why my brain kept those but suddenly they would just pop up.<p>- at the same time, the depression started to fade, also gone where the endless thought-circles about life in all it&#x27;s aspects, and my position in it. I still have those thoughts, but they don&#x27;t go in endless circles anymore, instead now I come to conclusions<p>- as a result of that, social interaction came back (not back to normal as it never was before, but back to acceptable levels anyway)<p>- as a result of that, I found a girlfriend, soon to be wife and likely mother of children<p>- one downside: from time to time there&#x27;s still an extremely strong urge to get completely wasted. Now I always had this, the typical craving and search for a high, but after quitting with weed it only became stronger. Like my mind is still addicted to being altered. Lots of sports helps to suppress it, but I admit sometimes I still go wild, mainly on alcohol and preferrably when I&#x27;m my own. Seems like a small price to pay though.",1394015774

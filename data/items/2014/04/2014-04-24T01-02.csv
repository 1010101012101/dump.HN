But they are no better predictors than high school grades alone. And the scoring shows significant correlations with factors like gender, race, language, family income, etc.--so they&#x27;re not objective.<p>From this article:<p>> The University of California, Berkeley1 economist Jesse M. Rothstein has found that the combination of a student’s high school grades and demographic information predicted first-year grades in college about as well as her high school grades and SAT scores do.<p>> DePaul is implementing their own tests for non-cognitive skills, with a series of essay questions. For the entering class of 2012, about 10 percent of applicants (or about 5 percent of the freshman class) chose not to send ACT or SAT scores. Instead they completed four short-answer questions, designed to measure their leadership skills and their ability to meet long-term goals. Systematically scoring the responses to those questions, DePaul reported that the freshman-to-sophomore retention rate was almost identical for those who submitted standardized test scores (85 percent) and those who did not (84 percent).",1398304747

GOTO 01410 should be obvious that it&#x27;s going to that line.  Math and comparison operators are the same as most languages.  00001 REM (C) 1977-2014 RICHARD GARRIOTT should immediately show that REM is some kind of code comment unless you&#x27;re insane enough to think the language is going to execute a copyright statement that&#x27;s preceded by a mysterious &#x27;REM&#x27;. READ in a 1 to 7 loop seems to correspond to the dnd stat attributes in the DATA statement above it.  Then there&#x27;s another READ, with 2 variables, in a loop from 1 to 15, which seems to correspond to the 30 other variables in the previous data statement.  etc.  I have seen BASIC before, though.",1398304517

I owned a couple of those devices, fact of the matter was you paid more to be on an isolated moderately performing island.   To be interesting, you need an Atx board or something with a better chip at the same price or the whole thing has to be cheaper.

I&#x27;m still trying to solve it, but I found that some things help:<p>1. A cardio workout. (Came highly recommended by a dear client of mine, and indeed significantly increases the amount of energy I feel during the day. Does not solve procrastination by itself, but helps with that sleepiness.)<p>2. Pair programming. (This is a true deal breaker.

So, yeah, it&#x27;s hard/impossible to do DSLs, but that might not be a Bad Thing.<p>Generics is a (frequently discussed) downside. It&#x27;s definitely a tradeoff. For every container type we had, we had to make a copy of it or a typesafe wrapper around it for every possible instantiation of the container with different types. If you&#x27;re used to coding by making flexible containers and so on, that&#x27;s definitely much more brittle and challenging in Go.

Forster wrote this in 1909, before there were even televisions. He essentially predicted humanity&#x27;s future obsession with screens long before anyone else did, and even predicted the advent of video chat.\n- He predicted that humanity would become increasingly isolated and disconnected from the regular world, to the extreme that they literally must live underground.\n- He predicted that those who controlled the machine would act in malevolence (this is, to some extent, true today)<p>In the end, it&#x27;s just a perspective on a dystopian future, somewhat like Ayn Rand&#x27;s Anthem.

Running Emacs would be doable, but most 3270 editors I can remember (low 80&#x27;s) took advantage of the local terminal smarts and worked on a form/page based concept. Emacs was designed for the VT-100 world where terminals were not particularly smart.<p>Having said that, you can host Linux VMs under zVM.

7404640,comment,7396119,7404097,1,0,trycatch,,,"> I appreciate your level-headed unbiased approach. You prefer Fox News, I presume?<p>What an amazing argument, because there are only two media outlets in the world -- Fox News and Huffington Post. No, I prefer VÃ¶lkischer Beobachter obviously.<p>> So, for you, Russian sources are propaganda, and EU and Israel sources are misinformed (apparently by the Russians), and only Ukrainian pro-Maidan sources matter.<p>EU is generally ok, nobody supports Putin, except few marginal media outlets (or marginals inside of mainstream outlet), so you need to mine for a good quote -- Russian propagandists even had to leak taped Paet conversations to mine good for them quote.<p>> and only Ukrainian pro-Maidan sources matter.<p>Good sources matter (like independent journalists reporting facts), authoritative opinions matter (like opinion about local antisemitism by local Jewish community). Opinions of some leftie guy from the different part of the Earth, who decided to mine some quotes for one side and call that &quot;analysis&quot; -- no, sorry, thing like these don&#x27;t matter.<p>> Do you think the armed masked &quot;peaceful demonstrators&quot; storming government buildings might have something to do with it?<p>This has everything to do with the president who at first stole billions, then decided to shot in his own citizens killing almost 100, and then fled away cutting all communications, including communications with his own party.<p>> I think those armed masked people are the reason why the Ukrainian Jews wrote such a letter.<p>Nice conspiracy theory. Strangely, people like Joseph Zisels were not afraid to speak out in the Soviet Union (where Zisels was held in prison for some years for his anti-Soviet views), but now they are so scared that even write panegyrics about neo-Nazis.<p>> Here is what a chief Ukrainian rabbi has to say about &quot;peaceful protesters&quot; [1]:<p>Oh, jeez. You just can&#x27;t not to bring here all the pro-Russian lies? Haaretz lied. See &quot;How newspaper Haaretz distorted words of Ukrainian Rabbi&quot; [1]. Long story short -- 1) Haaretz chronologically moved the statement by the rabbi. Reuven Azman told about it on 20 February, the day when snipers killed more than 50, so it made sense in context. Haaretz published it on 22 February, when Yanukovich already fled and the situation was stable. So Azman talked about the danger _from Yanukovich_, not from protesters. 2) Haaretz misquoted Azman, his statement was not about all Jews, but only women and children. Extended to all Kiev&#x27;s Jews by Haaretz. 3) And then Haaretz claimed that Azman had connections with Kremlin -- and that was the claim Azmad actually considered to sue them for.<p>Now Rabbi Reuven Azman just like everybody else denies Russian lies about neo-Nazism [2] -- &quot;Chief Rabbi of Kyiv and Ukraine: There is no Ethnic or Religious Hatred in Ukraine&quot;.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.forumdaily.com/kak-gazeta-haaretz-perevrala-ukrainskogo-ravvina/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forumdaily.com/kak-gazeta-haaretz-perevrala-ukrai...</a> (in Russian)<p>[2] <a href=""http://uacrisis.org/chief-rabbi-of-kyiv-and-ukraine-there-is-no-ethnic-or-religious-hatred-in-ukraine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uacrisis.org/chief-rabbi-of-kyiv-and-ukraine-there-is...</a>",1394891692

Microsoft still make an awful lot of money serving that market.<p>Meanwhile, the norms for selling tablet software are very different to traditional business software. (&quot;What, you want me to pay TEN WHOLE DOLLARS for an app that&#x27;s going to save me at least an hour every day? Are you crazy?!&quot;)<p>Releasing a full office suite onto tablets is not a no-brainer decision in that context, and I&#x27;m not surprised the new CEO hasn&#x27;t pushed the button yet.<p>It seems unlikely that a tablet version would make anything like the revenues per user the traditional desktop version did. Perhaps MS can establish some sort of subscription SaaS model here, but I&#x27;m extremely sceptical about the long-time viability of that model as a replacement for traditional COTS software products.<p>On the other hand, if a tablet version provided a decent viewing platform for people who do do more reading than writing, it could potentially damage desktop sales if those people would otherwise have been added into the site licence or similar for the full desktop suite but no longer feel they need to be because they can just use the tablet at their desks as well.",1394891462

The Apache 2.0 license is very much lawyer talk and a little hard to read.<p>More likely it was the patent clause of the license that made it so bad that the OpenBSD developers didn&#x27;t want it. I can sort of see where they&#x27;re coming from. If some company puts a bit of code into Apache 2, covered by one of their patents, that&#x27;s okay, anyone using the Apache 2 gets a license. However it&#x27;s pretty much impossible for anyone to tell which parts of the code is covered by the patent, so you could get in trouble, without knowing it, if you yank out that part of the code an use it elsewhere. The patent could also cover a protocol, an algorithm, whatever, the people using the Apache licensed code don&#x27;t care, they where given a license for the pattern, but nobody else can do an implementation.<p>It&#x27;s not for me to say, but I believe that the OpenBSD developers wanted an http server that came unencumbered by patent and was ensured to be free of any software patent.

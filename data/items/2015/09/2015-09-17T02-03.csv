They were performed by the Defense Nuclear Agency, in conjunction with the Explorer 4 space mission....</i><p><i>The tests were proposed by Nicholas Christofilos of what was then the Livermore branch of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (now Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) as a means to verify the Christofilos effect, which argued that high-altitude nuclear detonations would create a radiation belt in the extreme upper regions of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Such belts would be similar in effect to the Van Allen radiation belts. Such radiation belts were viewed as having possible tactical use in war. Prior to Argus, Hardtack Teak had shown disruption of radio communications from a nuclear blast, though this was not due to the creation of radiation belts....</i><p><i>Due to the South Atlantic Anomaly, the Van Allen radiation belt is closer to the Earth&#x27;s surface at that location. The (extreme) altitude of the tests was chosen so as to prevent personnel involved in the test from being exposed to any ionizing radiation.</i><p>This and other space-based testing destroyed several satellites, including the first communications satellite, Telstar, which failed after only seven months.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telstar</a><p>A memo concerning the failure of a British satellite, Ariel-1, recently surfaced and was reported by the BBC:<p><a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150910-the-nuke-that-fried-satellites-with-terrifying-results"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150910-the-nuke-that-fried...</a>",1442458699

No. Your &quot;extreme analogy&quot; was to illustrate your &quot;point&quot; that he should have exercised &quot;common sense.&quot; This is a form of victim blaming and is wrong.

I&#x27;m well aware of what constitutes an ideal and what constitutes reality. Here&#x27;s reality: he was within his rights to do exactly what he did, he is now better for doing exactly what he did, and you suggesting that he settle for the status quo and suggesting that he made a mistake (because his immediate reality is filled with ignorant people) is not helpful.

So is vote.&quot;<p>I did a quick browse and search of the source on github for &quot;comment&quot;, &quot;vote&quot; and &quot;login&quot;. How do you handle logging in/submitting comments/votes? Just present the regular hn login inside the app, and use the hn site?<p>I thought there was some TOS/gentlman&#x27;s agreement that APIs only had read access to stories, and one needed/should use the hn page for comments/votes? Perhaps I&#x27;m mistaken?<p>I suppose there&#x27;s no rule against making a custom browser though -- while a bit heavy handed, I suppose there&#x27;s really no difference between wrapping node+electron and enhancing the UI/UX with greasmonkey -- I suppose the main issue is to behave closely enough to a regular web visitor, so as not to put undue strain on the service, not demand that every visitor <i>actually</i> uses a general purpose browser...?",1442457320

10231263,comment,10228904,10231149,0,0,vidarh,,,"Speaking from experience from my long standing (and slow-moving) work on a Ruby ahead-of-time compiler [1], as Ruby and JS has most of the same issues:<p>The first and most obvious problem in terms of performance is that for sufficiently dynamic languages it is exceedingly hard to know what types will look like at runtime. Both in JS and Ruby you can define types at runtime. In Ruby by mutating classes at runtime, and in JS by mutating prototypes.<p>This means that it&#x27;s much harder to e.g. lay out objects so that you can cheaply access attributes just through indexed reads for example. It also makes e.g. inlining very hard, as it may be hard to impossible to even determine the types of objects you&#x27;ll get passed. There are lots of workarounds, but many of them bring you progressively closer to including a full JIT anyway.<p>For a JIT like V8, you can infer/guess at types because you have the entire infrastructure to correct your guess. E.g. if you come across a &quot;Point&quot; class that appears to have the attributes/instance variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, you can allocate those objects, and if a &quot;z&quot; is introduced later, you can either create a hidden subclass dynamically or you can re-allocate all existing Point instances with an extra field, and re-compile the code that accesses it accordingly. In an ahead of time compiler, this is harder without either embedding a JIT anyway, or embedding specialized code that carries out specialised code generation tasks etc., or trying to infer a single unified type (but this is problematic; code that is validly executed for the Point class when the instances doesn&#x27;t have &quot;z&quot; could very well fail or behave entirely differently once it is mutated to add it)<p>Ultimately I believe that a <i>lot</i> of dynamic code is ultimately de-facto static, but even for code that in effect is 100% static at runtime, you sometimes may need extra hints to guarantee that. E.g. any code that loads a library could potentially be <i>intended</i> to be static, but for dynamic languages you may need extra hints beyond the semantics of the language to know whether the library is meant to always be static, or e.g. is intended to be a plugin mechanism. (A typical Ruby idiom is to iterate over a directory listing and &quot;require&quot; every <i>.rb file found in it; that maybe to avoid having to explicitly list all of them, or it may be to let people drop in plugins)<p>Once you know where that delineation is, there&#x27;s often nothing particular preventing type inference across the board, but it can be a </i>lot* of effort. E.g. in both Javascript and Ruby, you face the situation that an analysis of the types that is valid in one instance can be invalid the next, so must be at least in theory prepared to run type-inference several times and potentially be forced to generate different code based on <i>when</i> in the program fow a method is called.<p>E.g. even in my compiler implementation, I&#x27;m likely to, for the ease of bootstrapping, end up <i>replacing</i> methods with more capable versions during the bootstrap of the runtime library, and it may very well end up altering which types are safe inputs to a given methods.<p>Dynamic languages also often make it tricky to determine conclusively what should be compile errors. E.g. a lot of constructs in Ruby will trigger exceptions that seems like they should be compile time errors. For example there&#x27;s a LoadError if &quot;require&quot; fails to find a file. But most of them can also be caught, and then for an AOT compiler you face the challenge of deciding whether to try to process that at compile time (e.g. conditionally including an optional dependency can be done this way) or generate code to try the load at runtime (and thus losing a lot of the ability to statically infer the precise types at compile time, as for what you know the runtime version of this file may redefine everything).<p>For my part I intend to resolve a lot of this with pragma&#x27;s and compiler flags to let you signal whether to favour precise compliance with the interpreted Ruby, or making it as static as possible (if I ever get that far...)<p>[1] <a href=""http://hokstad.com/compiler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hokstad.com/compiler</a>",1442457218

I&#x27;m not sure.<p>Anyway, I wanted a quick method to collapse comment theads, and I ended up with a tool that lets you fold/unfold any subtree (as determined by the indent width).<p>[1] I&#x27;m sure there are better ways to handle the CSS for the fold-icon. The <div style=&quot;width: ...&quot;> hack seems to be necessary or the icon wraps to the next line. This might be completely unnecessary if the icon was placed somewhere saner.<p>[2] I should be binding the click handler once above all the posts. Probably not a hard change, but for now the per-comment closure seems to work fine.",1442456168

Another issues is closures, where variables and properties available to nested functions are dependent on the outer functions. Combined with the floating &quot;this&quot;, leads to highly dynamic behaviour which can only be assessed at runtime.",1442456037

Most of these promises appear to be good and reasonable ideas without an ulterior motive. The only part that I don&#x27;t quite understand is #6 where they talk about the &quot;supervision of society&quot;.<p>Farther down the article:<p>> The letter also asks the American companies to ensure their products are “secure and controllable,” a catchphrase that industry groups said could be used to force companies to build so-called back doors — which allow third-party access to systems — provide encryption keys or even hand over source code.<p>I don&#x27;t see that phrase anywhere in this document, though the individual words do appear several times.

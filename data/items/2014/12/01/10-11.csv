Truly it is sad that this child will live without its father, but it&#x27;s also a gift to the world -- a bit of Steven, living on. It will be a continuing gift to Steven&#x27;s loved ones to have a permanent, living piece of Steven, a continuance of himself after he slips into the eons. When you get that kind of gift, as sad as everything else around it may be, it almost feels like cheating.<p>I just feel like this is a perspective that may not be immediately realized among groups of people that don&#x27;t have their own children. I know before I had children, I would have only viewed it as tragic.",1417431584

I spent almost a year there and this is a country where I am not going back.<p>I worked as an engineer in big enterprise at 35 hours a week + RTTs - meaning I am working 37.5 hours but I can take more days off. Everything sounded great before I went there and realized there is double standard - employees vs. contractors. If you are a contractor you have no rights and you are expected to work as much as your manager says. In the end I was spending more than 50-55 hours a week and the overtime I did was not paid accordingly. If I wasn&#x27;t OK with this I&#x27;d be let go easily and there are no laws that protect me. I would not be fired, but I will be transferred back to the contracting company who is not obliged to pay me, if I am not working for a client.",1417431580

8680376,comment,8677556,8679812,0,0,lmm,,,"> Sometimes I wonder why developers aren&#x27;t forced to just use LISP since everybody in the whole world knows that LISP is super expressive that it MUST resulted in far less code right? Right?<p>You&#x27;ve fallen for Lisp propaganda :P. If you look at the shootout, Python and Ruby are comfortably ahead of Lisp in the expressiveness stakes.<p>> Fred Brooks Second System <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect</a> is exactly what you&#x27;re experiencing, forget the language war for a second please. Really.<p>Really not. This was one of the leanest places I&#x27;ve ever worked; everything we did there was absolutely necessary for the scale we were operating at. I&#x27;ve seen second-system effect in action; last.fm wasn&#x27;t it. Writing Java will not save you from having to scale horizontally; maybe it&#x27;s 2x, 5x, 10x faster than a dynamic language, but if you&#x27;re growing then these kinds of constant factors only buy you a small amount of development time.<p>> Recently we refactor a certain part of our code and added Microservice written in JAX-RS because we have to integrate with another product suite internally. That&#x27;s what I called re-use and evolution of code-base: 10 years of Java where some of the code from the past were/are reused and still in production today. (.... but boy those old code aren&#x27;t pretty, hehehehe).<p>If you&#x27;re using microservices multiple languages really shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. It&#x27;s not like we rewrote everything; services that were fine in PHP stayed in PHP. We moved things to Java as and when we needed to. If everything&#x27;s a service (Thrift in our case) then it really doesn&#x27;t matter what language is on the other end.<p>And it&#x27;s not exactly &quot;from scratch&quot;. Physically typing out the code is never the bottleneck; most of the hard part of programming is design, getting the correct decomposition of the problem. Porting well-written code from one language to another language that supports the same paradigms is really not that hard, and certainly doesn&#x27;t mean throwing away all the lessons of the first codebase.",1417431331

Not everybody wants to go the whole way down the Single Page Abbit hole. It&#x27;s not only  a question of speed or SEO.<p>I think many devs are both backend & front-end craftsmen, and as so build the backend first and then wish to &#x27;grow&#x27; their frontend part on that foundation. Or ideally wish they could. Instead they have to fork the project into 1). the Good Ol&#x27; server HTML part 2). the API SPA part.<p>No matter how close angular or react (with jsx) stays to HTML, you still need to rewrite the whole view to comply with it&#x27;s templating needs. There&#x27;s no incremental evolution there, and worse : having to duplicate and sync maintenance on both ends, breaks the DRY principle which is fundamentally bad - since you end up with 2 sources of truth.<p>Pre-rendering the view with react on node (even if your on rails or whatever) may be a solution I don&#x27;t know yet. Another take I guess would be to render your server html files with a template which complies with their JS counterpart. Yet another take would be to use HTML as the API instead of JSON - which is proven to work quiet well.<p>Anyways, just to conclude I think devs would feel more confident if they could rely a little more on the servers end while the frontend finds its ways and stabilizes a little.",1417430890

Unfortunately it is not always practical or under your control.<p>From a developers PoV you can increase the consistency of your users backups by being careful how you order operations. If you make sure the DB is updated <i>after</i> the file is in place and tell the app administrators to backup the database <i>first</i>, and your blobs are insert-and-soft-delete only (you can do updates in an insert & soft delete only way with versioning instead of in-place updates). That way you are never in a position where you have a missing blob, though you might end up with orphans where inserts happen during the time the backup took to run.<p>Other than that, as you say, you have to stop the app or the app has to have built in support for consistent backups (or integration into your chosen solution).<p>To minimise the downtime associated with this you can use tricks like LVM snapshots or your OS&#x27;s equivalent. That way the downtime is only as long as it takes to stop the app, take the snapshot, and restart the app, instead of the full length of time it takes to make the backup (which could be a fairly long time if it involves a full backup of a large DB), and it means you can coordinate the backups of apps that are integrated (or just used in sync) but not in a transactionally safe way, without having to stop them all for the full backup run.<p>That is the best you can do without explicit support in the app - there is only so much a backup solution can be in control of.",1417430401

A lot of the things he mentions are of the type &quot;in this precise, extremely rare situation it is possible, if we ignore all the other side effects&quot;.  For example, I&#x27;m sure his calculations will be correct regarding the planet orbiting a black hole close enough for relativistic effects.  What it also means is that the planet would pass through the extremely hot accretion disk twice every orbit, killing everything and evaporating all the water.  And considering the speed that a stable orbit would require, that would be a very common occurrence.<p>The point is: don&#x27;t claim that you&#x27;re scientifically accurate.  Usually, a good sci-fi movie will set up rules for itself, and follow those rules appropriately.  If you make your ruleset &quot;real world physics&quot;, you have to be extremely accurate if you still want to make it believable.  The rules set up expectations, and breaking your own rules is an instant turn-off for science fiction fans.<p>The movie shows other cases where it doesn&#x27;t follow its own rules: they have spaceplanes that can get to orbit from a planet with 1.8 times earth gravity, but not from earth without huge boosters?<p>For the record: I like Interstellar a lot.

For each transaction they want 2 consistent pieces of evidence of location, but the sources of said data are fairly broad & include ip address, some form of geolocation and the self reported location by the end-user, credit card location etc etc. Anything that the vendor believes to be reasonably reliable according to their data-model really.

(This is what Steam requests already btw.)<p>The problem for vendors is that the rules pushes liability onto them when they want certainty, plus the data storage requirements are fairly stringent (10 years!). The tax authorities are effectively saying: you can either collect enough information to be absolutely certain of the end-user location or collect less and carry the risk that an audit will result in big fines if we decide that you&#x27;ve been attempting to evade VAT by misrepresenting the location of your customers. This is of course no different from any other tax, but with a new system there&#x27;s always some uncertainty to begin with until things settle down & no one likes uncertainty.",1417428862

For now, it starts with free access to startups and developers for the object recognition library which is un-domain constrained, i.e objects range from apparel (purse, sunglasses, etc) to decor (bedroom, living room) to scenes (beach, mountain etc). Our intent and plan is to collaborate with developers all over the globe to extend the platform adding their own models irrespective of classifier type to the library to build the largest scalable object recognition platform. Overtime if your object model is used by paying enterprise customers, we will also offer rev-share agreements. The input is one jpeg/png or a keyframe from a video. The output is a probabilistic match score. 
We look forward to working with you.<p><a href=""http://developers.vufind.com/visual.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developers.vufind.com/visual.php</a>

3. Use Tor for everything that pertains to your project.
4. Find a group that really needs your product and have them on your side, like dissidents in dictatorships, talk to them, find out how your product can help them, if you're in a ""democratic"" country and the authorities come after you, you can legitimately tell them that you're helping to free the people of a country, it helps to be able to name dissidents who have been murdered by such a regime, you can then ask the agents of your state if they are in favor of these murders, in many countries advocating murder in a different state is a crime, so it is most likely they will not answer your question, merely asking that in a recorded interview will most likely see you free. Afterwards, assuming you are free from state interference it is important that you make it public what has happened to you, do interviews with tech and liberty minded media, talk to the EFF, NOT Wired.
5. Have contingency plans, like having your schematics, code etc ready to be distributed on TPB like the 3D printed gun from Defense Distributed has been.
6. If you are at some stage going to release what you have non-anonymously, do it through a separate legal entity, like a limited liability company, so any legal ramifications are borne by that legal entity and you are not personally liable, you will need a lawyer to advise you, you might contact the EFF and have a conversation with them.

There may be a <i>few</i> surface-level parallels, but that's where the similarities end.<p>I am stunned however that a person who very likely has never even visited either place (much less lived in them) has the gall to call what Turkey is going through ""Singaporification.""

But using the events in Istanbul as an opportunity to bash Singapore is just... petty and shameless.<p>I would love to give you a detailed breakdown of the differences between Singapore and Turkey, but that would be an essay. I'll highlight a few important ones.<p>Singapore is one of the least corrupt countries in the world. Turkey on the other hand is rampant with corruption, especially the current government. That's part of the reason why the protests started: the contractor that was going to build the mall on top of Gezi Park has ties to the Prime Minister, who was going to profit from it. That's just ONE example.<p>Singapore is extremely diverse culturally. There are several religions and languages. As a result, there are often no culturally accepted behaviors. In a sense, Singapore does not really fit the traditional definition of a nation, and instead has been called a society in transition. In contrast, Turkey has a very strong cultural identity rooted deeply in the country's history and predominant religion, Islam.<p>The two country's governments are also extremely different. Singapore is a de-facto one-party state; the dominant party, the PAP, has won every single general election since the first one. In contrast, Turkey is a multi-party system, which creates very complex dynamics in the political landscape.<p>I can go on, but you get the idea.

Basically, when the optimization function of our economy only takes into account the preferences of the rich and the government, we create many inefficiencies in the production and distribution of goods and services.  When we instead redistribute money such that everyone has at least some, the economy is more efficient and production changes to match.  If more people want to buy simple clothing and the price rises more people will make simple clothing and the price will fall again.<p>This is the hypothesis I have heard for why raising the minimum wage doesn't lower employment (the experimental result which perhaps most clearly demonstrates the flaws in modern macroeconomic models.)  People who receive minimum wage spend it on other goods that are produced employing more people who earn minimum wage.",1370196648

As the printing process involves layering inks to achieve colors, the ability to <i>create</i> different colors is a function of that printers ability to lay down ink, so typically the color gamut of the printer will be ""lousy"" at its highest resolution (as low as 8 colors) and at a smaller ""effective"" resolution will cross the point where it can print all the colors you would expect. This second number is often referred to as the 'screen resolution' not because of CRT screens but because of silk screen printing. So early HP printers would have a ""resolution"" of 300 DPI but a screen resolution that was closer to 120 dpi.<p>In the photography business people talked about 'lines' which was the smallest width line you could have in contrasting colors on the film that the film could reproduce. Hence those test patterns you saw of groups of lines in standard image targets.<p>CRTs used a shadow mask, a way of blocking the electron beam around the different colored phosphors. You were limited to 1/3 to 1/4 the shadow mask resolution as you needed at least three phosphor patches to reproduce colors.",1370196520

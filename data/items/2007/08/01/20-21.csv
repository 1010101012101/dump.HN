38481,comment,38028,38437,0,0,portLAN,,,"That's not necessarily the case.  For example, consider IRC, once the bane of many college students' academic records: Many sites and services actually have negative value, by being addictive time sinks.<p>Economic theories tend to neglect considerations like people's self-destructive behavior; or they re-define it to make the theory work (""it's not a bug, it's a feature!"").  The classic example is of a destructive drug habit.<p>The addictive element creates a larger user base, but its value is highly debatable:  EverQuest was nicknamed EverCrack and World of Warcraft is similar; addictive elements also play into gambling sites, collectible card games, instant messaging, and even sites like Reddit.  Anything that sucks up your attention and wastes your time is a net liability.  Television sitcoms create the ""value"" of watching someone else's fake life by withdrawing your attention from your own, real one.  (And it initiates a cycle, as the more you watch, the less of a real life you have, the more you'll turn to the comforting artificial alternatives.)<p>Thus, I don't subscribe to the idea that merely because people are using something, it must have value for <i>them</i>.  It has value for the <i>purveyor</i> of the service or substance; and due to corporate self-interest, that is often confused in business with value for the user.<p>If lacing a drug with plutonium made it a hundred times more addictive, most corporations would have no problem selling radioactive crack (and killing off all their users), as long as it made the numbers work for <i>this quarter</i>.<p>If life is made torturous so that selling an anesthetic is big business, claiming it ""creates value"" is begging the question in accepting that life should be like that in the first place.  Almost all mass media, including sports, and including the aforementioned addictive games and services, are forms of anesthesia.<p>The real value would be stopping the death by a thousand cuts, not anesthetizing ourselves to it.\n",1186001485

The new part seems to be notion of pushing it down into the application code instead of paying Oracle or IBM a few million dollars for a DBMS that handles it automatically.",1186001103
38478,comment,38407,38443,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It's a bit more than that - sharding is fundamentally a way of spreading writes.  You're limited in the number of writes you can make by the speed at which the disk rotates, so this quickly becomes a bottleneck, particularly in heavily-trafficked social sites.  Sharding lets you spread your writes out among an arbitrary number of machines, so you can grow with traffic.<p>Big sites that are primarily read-hungry often don't need to shard at all, instead relying upon replication.  Look at Craigslist - they have a single master database, about 20 slaves, and an archive cluster for postings that nobody looks at anymore.  Or PlentyOfFish - 1 machine for billions of pageviews.  Social sites with lots of user-created content need to shard much earlier - LiveJournal has a fraction of the users as Craigslist, but they had to start sharding around 2002/2003.<p>There're locality concerns as well, but they tend to be secondary to the write issue.  Disks are big, and with good caching you can often avoid hitting the disk at all.",1186000833

These titles are instantly viewable by other people, so they will be spammed.  I've heard Bayesian filtering fails when the content consists of only a few words.  Is there an ideal way to filter these?  How did Reddit do it?<p>The titles aren't combined with a link, so I can't follow a link.  I can filter out titles with URLs in them, though.",1185999852

Chances are they're at a stage where they don't like the idea of working for a big company anyway.<p>If you're currently working at another company, you can approach co-workers who are your friends. But be very careful with this... This could be used as evidence that you are violating an IP or non-compete agreement.<p>If neither of those works, might want to check out computer science career fairs at a few of the good universities. Some of the guys graduating could be quality hackers willing to take risk.<p>The traditional means recruiters use to get Sr people (like LinkedIn) might turn up people who cost too much (and generally suck), but could still be worth a shot.<p>Good luck.",1185999713

If more water is available, California is entitled to 50% of the water from the Colorado River, Arizona to 46%, and Nevada to 4%. If less water is available, the Secretary of the Interior must allocate the water according to various formulas (which were the subjects of the court cases) to ensure that each state receives a specified amount, with California receiving an absolute fixed maximum of 4,400,000 acre feet per year (547 U.S. 157).",1412132248

8392577,comment,8390136,8390136,7,0,Throwaway12830,,,"This seems incredibly strange. Personally, I don&#x27;t see how it&#x27;s going to add value to Reddit and help build the community. Mixing money into the site is going to complicate things, bring forward a lot of challenges, and it&#x27;s going to be a large time sink.<p>I think Reddit has more important things to focus on, and I don&#x27;t find this to be a good use of resources. Reddit is also slow to roll out changes, so if this has a negative impact, it&#x27;ll take them a long time to pivot back on track.<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s going to be a minor feature that the majority of users never know exists, and things will continue as they do now. If it&#x27;s a major feature, I think it&#x27;ll be a flop, and open up room for competition.<p>Edit: To expand a little more, what&#x27;s the best case scenario they&#x27;re hoping for here? They think the community is going to grow and more people will flock to the site because of this change? Reddit is anti-corporate, the community likes to feel small, even though it&#x27;s one of the largest communities on the internet. When they associate money with the site, people will look at it as more of a business, and I think that&#x27;ll drive more people away than it brings in.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t Reddit just launch an image hosting platform? Why do they send all this traffic to imgur and gfycat, when they could roll out their own solution for the community? They can spin it off into a separate service to attract non-Redditors, and with all the incoming visitors from other sources, they can refer more people back to Reddit. To me, this seems like a no-brainer, since a large portion of their site revolves around images, and they&#x27;re giving that traffic and monetization away to third parties at the moment.",1412132017
8392576,comment,8388156,8391635,1,0,nemo,,,"I don&#x27;t think Biosphere 2 is a great example.  In Mission 1 there were huge problems regulating CO2 and O2, their pollinators died, invasive insects took over, and they had continually increasing NO2 and CH4 gases.  They eventually injected O2 from outside to make up for the decreasing levels, and when a participant got sick, they smuggled supplies back on their return.  It was a disaster.  And they had a door they could open to walk out.<p>The issues with getting something like an ecosystem on Mars would be much more dramatic, esp. given that while there are some ways of getting O2 and carbon, there isn&#x27;t a source of nitrogen on Mars that we know (we assume there&#x27;s fixed nitrogen in minerals, though that&#x27;s very hard to breathe).  Any loss of significant life forms would need to be replenished from Earth.  And while some life forms will probably manage in 38% gravity, there&#x27;s no reason to assume many would have long term viability (especially vertebrates like humans who depend on Earth gravity to function).<p>Getting an ecosystem on Mars that could support humans doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s in the realm of possibility to me, especially when there&#x27;s good reason to believe humans themselves wouldn&#x27;t be able to survive for long periods there unless something managed to solve that very hard problem.  You could use a centrifuge for the long trip out (and nobody could survive without that), but you can&#x27;t just live in a centrifuge on Mars forever.",1412131992
8392575,comment,8389728,8391583,6,0,Udo,,,"As someone who chose the Lua runtime as a basis for his own toy language, these are my observations:<p>A. True. Paradoxically Lua&#x27;s source is well-documented in places that arguably didn&#x27;t need documentation in the first place, but it tends to contain <i>no comments whatsoever</i> in tricky places like the VM or the implementation of internal data objects.<p>B. Global-by-default has bugged me as well. Thankfully it&#x27;s not difficult to patch it so declarations are mandatory and local though.<p>C. It&#x27;s a matter of taste in the end. I struggled for a while on whether to convert it to 0-based indexing or not, but so far have left things as they are. Depending on your programming style, you might end up not using indexes directly all that much.<p>D. The distinction between having separate array and hash parts in a table kind-of works, but only if you make the conscious decision never to work with numerical indexes. Generally, I think this type of array/map hybrid is something PHP got right with their ordered hash maps, whereas Lua&#x27;s way of doing things have a few gotchas.<p>[] For a lot of applications, having only one number type works surprisingly well. I just wish they had opted for morphing the internal number representation according to usage in the script, instead they are now doing a separate int type in Lua 5.3 which feels a little out of place for my taste.<p>[] I really don&#x27;t think Lua needs a separate symbol type.<p>[] Things I didn&#x27;t like include how often you have to check for certain conditions in Lua to avoid raising fatal errors. Not being able to use keywords inside the table dot notation. The idea that the self operator works on a function in the table instead of its metatable. The lacking core library, especially when it comes to table usage. The fact that a require()&#x27;d file doesn&#x27;t know its own file name. No default to-string serialization on tables. The pattern that control flow statements always require code block components instead of single expressions. Goto statements.<p>Here&#x27;s a link to my project which addresses my personal Lua pain points: <a href=""http://np-lang.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://np-lang.org/</a>",1412131981

This periphytic alga forms large “blooms” in temperate streams, presenting a counterintuitive result: the blooms occur primarily in oligotrophic streams and rivers, where phosphorus (P) availability typically limits primary production. The goal of this study is to examine how high algal biomass is formed under low P conditions. We reveal a biogeochemical process by which D. geminata mats concentrate P from flowing waters. First, the mucopolysaccaride stalks of D. geminata adsorb both iron (Fe) and P. Second, enzymatic and bacterial processes interact with Fe to increase the biological availability of P. We propose that a positive feedback between total stalk biomass and high growth rate is created, which results in abundant P for cell division. The affinity of stalks for Fe in association with iron-phosphorus biogeochemistry suggest a resolution to the paradox of algal blooms in oliogotrophic streams and rivers.</i>",1412130281

The &quot;smart&quot; cards that the government uses aren&#x27;t intended to help government officials hide incriminating information from the public.<p>The media has a habit of seeking out young, naive Soldiers and soliciting their opinions on a wide variety of issues. When unsuspecting Soldiers comment on these issues, the media will then present that individual Soldier&#x27;s opinion on the topic as the United States Military&#x27;s official opinion. In the worst cases, they will actually edit the interview to take the Soldier&#x27;s statements out of their original context in order to give his words whatever meaning the media finds most interesting.<p>They particularly enjoy asking very awkward, politically charged questions, even though they are aware of the fact that Soldiers aren&#x27;t allowed to be seen promoting any sort of political viewpoint. For example, they might ask a Soldier what his opinion is on the United States&#x27; drone warfare program. While there&#x27;s a good chance that the Soldier agrees that the program is out of control, if he says as much on camera he&#x27;s probably going to end up getting demoted for damaging the state of &quot;good order and discipline&quot; of the U.S. Military. To a civilian, all the Soldier did was express an idea, yet when you analyze the situation from the viewpoint of the military, what he actually did was call into question the decisions made my our military and political leaders, which violates military law.<p>The bottom line is that the smart cards exist to keep Soldiers that are inexperienced in dealing with journalists from getting themselves into trouble. There isn&#x27;t anything nefarious about it at all.<p>Its important to note that not all journalists conduct themselves in a dishonest manner, but the practice is prevalent enough to warrant attention from the military.",1412129926

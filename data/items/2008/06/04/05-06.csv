208625,comment,208518,208529,0,0,notdarkyet,,,"No it is not and you are correct in that assessment.  Personally, Obama does not represent a good portion of my views in terms of policy, but what he does represent for me is a new wave in politics, a wave that is once again representative of the people rather than individual incentive and making decisions based on who is going to line their pockets.  Anything to end corruption is better to me than someone who is going to promise to act within my set of views for what is best for this country and then do the opposite or what they want.<p>My view, personally, is that government should act as a safety net rather than a guiding father figure.  I tend to float towards more libertarian policies than anything, small government and as little intervention as possible (a view that can be considered almost the complete opposite side of the spectrum than Obama).  My view is that this nation has grounding and worked for so many years to be a country of opportunity, therefore, the structure of government should reflect that ideal and anyone who is willing to work hard should be rewarded for it (no free gifts).<p>What I do support from Obama are his values (or proposed and believed values) as a human being.  Not his religious values or the garbage perpetrated by the media (ie. reverand Wright).  He gives individuals a reason to believe that he is going to act on what is best for society and that enough might be what will make me forget about his views of government.  Yes, he most likely will propose policy that is near opposite of what I believe and I will make that admission, but I hope that having a man with a sense of ethics will take this country down a path where someone with my sense of views and his could come to some sort of a compromise with what is best for this country.  I would rather have that than the selfishness thats perpetuated this country since I have been alive.  I would rather have a man who will admit when he is wrong and correct it than someone who will ride it out.  Call him a flip flopper or whatever bullshit title you want to call it (I am talking to you media), a real man will admit when he is wrong or made a mistake and then go to fix it.<p>Back to why it is relevant, it is news to you as a hacker because he represents technical views that are in line with what most hackers view as what the internet should be; maintaining status quo and keeping the internet free.  I know without a doubt Obama would insure that the internet would continue to remain free and would not be corrupted by big business and allow them to manipulate the way traffic and data flows.  That, above anything, should be the most important issue to you, as is to me.  To my limited knowledge, he has promised to create a new IT oriented branch of the office if elected, which is once again relative to you.  I have had quite a few drinks tonight (I know it is a wednesday but I will give the fact that I am in college as an excuse) but I hope my statement is coherent; the more you think about it, someone in politics, or more specifically the president, has almost the most significant impact to any hacker as almost any individual possible and that is why it is relevant to you.

Hillary Clinton seems tough as nails compared to him, and she's wept publicly half a dozen times during the campaign. First of all, it's undeniable that McCain is tougher than Obama. As much as I hate Mac, the guy is 1000x tougher than the average person and he's got the crippled body to prove it. That's a given. Second, if you don't think the bully wins over the wimp, <i>you must be a democrat</i>, because that's a primary reason they can't win the presidency. John Kerry? WTF? Dukakis? Mondale?

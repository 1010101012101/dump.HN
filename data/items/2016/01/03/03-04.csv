10829434,comment,10825758,10828515,0,0,eridius,,,"> <i>You could now argue semantics wether WOFF2 still is WOFF</i><p>No arguing needed. It&#x27;s a different format. It uses a different extension (&quot;woff2&quot; instead of &quot;woff&quot;), a different magic number, a different Universal Type Identifier string, and a different @font-face format.<p>> <i>it&#x27;s a relatively easy change</i><p>But it&#x27;s not. Even WOFF2 isn&#x27;t supported everywhere (according to <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caniuse.com/#feat=woff2</a>). And that&#x27;s a format that&#x27;s fairly recent (the W3C Recommendation doc for WOFF 1.0 is dated December 2012) and only has a handful of implementations to begin with.<p>PNG is a format that&#x27;s a lot older and is decodable by practically everyone. Even if there&#x27;s only a handful of distinct implementations (and I don&#x27;t actually know how many implementations there are), and even if every single implementation updated immediately, it would still take an incredibly long time for it to get deployed widely-enough to actually use as a general-purpose format.<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that web fonts have built-in fallback behavior (e.g. if a browser can&#x27;t handle a WOFF2 font, you can provide a WOFF font as a backup), and they&#x27;re also things that are typically set up once (so generating multiple font formats is reasonable). Images don&#x27;t really have fallback behavior. On the web, the WHATWG HTML Living Standard defines a <picture> element that provides fallback but it&#x27;s not supported everywhere. Outside of the web there&#x27;s typically no way to do fallback either (if your browser can render an image but nothing else can, saving that image to disk isn&#x27;t very useful, and sending it to someone else isn&#x27;t very useful either). Also, while font files are created very rarely, images are created very frequently, and most people aren&#x27;t going to want to create &quot;PNG2&quot; images if they also have to create PNGs and deal with fallback (just look at WebP, which was released 5 years ago and still AFAIK is not used by very many people outside of Google).",1451793555
10829433,comment,10828450,10828450,0,0,jboy,,,"Credit to the D developers for providing a concise, carefully-designed library for N-D array processing.  The chained method invocations demonstrate D&#x27;s UFCS (Uniform Function Call Syntax) nicely.  And it&#x27;s a definite bonus that you can use underscore like a comma separator in long integer literals (eg, `100_000`).<p>But if you use Python + Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib and you&#x27;re looking for a modern, compiled language for execution speedups or greater flexibility than what Numpy broadcasting operations provide by default, I would recommend Nim.  It&#x27;s as fast as C++ or D, it has Pythonic syntax, and it already includes many of D&#x27;s best features (including type inference, UFCS, and underscores in integer literals).<p>And best of all, you <i>don&#x27;t</i> need to rewrite all your existing Python+Numpy code into a new language to start using Nim.<p>The Pymod library we&#x27;ve created allows you to write Nim functions, compile them as standard CPython extension modules, and simply drop them into your existing Python code: <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod</a><p>The Pymod library even includes a type `ptr PyArrayObject` that provides native Nim access to Numpy ndarrays via the Numpy C-API [ <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayobject-type"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayobject-type</a> ].  So you can bounce back and forth between your Python code and your Nim code for the cost of a Python extension module function call.  All of Numpy, Scipy & Matplotlib are still available to you in Python, in addition to statically-typed C++-like iterators in Nim+Pymod [ <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayiter-types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayiter-types</a> , <a href=""https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayiter-loop-idioms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jboy/nim-pymod#pyarrayiter-loop-idioms</a> ].

10829427,comment,10826836,10829230,0,0,sce,,,"> Thought experiment: Let&#x27;s make the minimum wage $1000 per hour. I&#x27;d like you to think through the ramifications. What would happen?<p>I&#x27;m assuming prices through the roof, companies forced to sack their workers, unemployment rate through the roof, companies go bankrupt, economy collapses.<p>I believe Sanders is suggesting $10/hour (and that it&#x27;s around $7 now). That&#x27;s just a number, but I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the threshold between &quot;needing welfare&quot; and not. So my argument is that if you&#x27;re paying an adult less than that then that&#x27;s less than the cost of that person to &quot;reasonably survive&quot;, thus artificially low. (In other words, companies are paying less for labor than the actual cost of labor.)<p>So now instead they&#x27;re getting $7 from their employer, and in practice $3 in welfare. That&#x27;s the difference with your example: People are already earning $10/hour, they&#x27;re just not getting it from their employer. So raising the minimum wage is not raising the cost of labor, it&#x27;s simply placing the entire burden on the employer instead of subsidizing it. There might even be room for a tax break there once people start number crunching. (Although in Sanders case I&#x27;m guessing he has other things to spend that money on, but I digress.)<p>If raising the minimum wage to the real cost of labor is a problem, then I just don&#x27;t understand why. The money is there, it&#x27;s just &quot;stuck&quot; at the top, and minimum wage is one way to help distribute some of the wealth (which really should benefit the economy as a whole, since the incredibly rich can&#x27;t possibly spend all their money like millions of middle class families would).<p>> What do we do now? We continue to work, even though we&#x27;re far past satisfying all of our material needs. Why didn&#x27;t everyone just stop working more hours than it takes to eat and stay warm?<p>I guess it&#x27;s partly because we live in a material world (where having a nice house, car, pretty clothes etc. is rewarding in its own right), and partly because money brings possibilities, and thus freedom: Freedom to travel, to not work, to do whatever one pleases. So money ultimately brings pleasure, and what else is life than seeking pleasure? ;-)",1451793299

Because of people were comparing that image to this:<p><a href=""https://thenanfang.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/parade-06.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thenanfang.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/parade-06....</a><p>Now how the heck are you supposed to follow that law?<p>USA censorship is more like &quot;child porn is bad, report it at once if you find it.&quot; It is an incredibly different form of very clear content restriction. It is not a vague threat hanging over your head all the time.",1451792354

10829368,comment,10825440,10825440,0,0,danso,,,"Sorry...I just have to disagree with the OP. Several years ago, Socrata stopped by where I worked (a news organization) and told us of their idea to build a portal of city governments everywhere that would host datasets. They were new at the time and I just thought they were bonkers.<p>Now, I can&#x27;t believe what you can find on the various data portals. There&#x27;s a lot of shit data but that&#x27;s because lots of organizations collect shit data. But for the organizations that <i>do</i> have data, Socrata is such a huge step from what existed before.<p>I&#x27;ll ignore the many situations in which agencies just didn&#x27;t put out data at all. Dallas, Texas is one exception. It has been posting its crime data for years. Except it was on a FTP site with a convoluted structure. And it wasn&#x27;t all in one file. So you had to write a script that spidered the subdirectories, downloaded the files, unzipped them, and concatenated them (and I don&#x27;t think they were a straight-up concatenation).<p>Now, it&#x27;s just all on one page from which you can export the data as bulk CSV [1]. Because Socrata&#x27;s REST API is so straightforward, you can just script your data requests to hit the right end points. But not only is there the incident data, there&#x27;s the narrative data [2] (which had also been on the FTP site, but required its own spidering), and there&#x27;s tables I hadn&#x27;t seen before, such as [3] suspects and real-time active calls [4]<p>On top of it, the police department has even decided to put up the data for their <i>officer-involved-shootings</i>. Mind you, they were <i>already</i> ahead of the game, nationwide, last year when they created a parseable (via scraper) webpage with HTML tables and PDFs. They certainly didn&#x27;t have to make their data even easier to get, but they did [5]<p>Texas has always been generally good about public records because of their broad sunshine law. But it&#x27;s not that the law turned them all into free-data-hippies right away...the agencies just have a tradition of doing it -- it helps alot if you&#x27;re a Texas employee and you&#x27;ve seen how everyone else just agrees to potentially damaging records requests, and yet no one gets stressed out.<p>I have to think that Socrata, just by being <i>there</i> as an option, not just in Dallas, but everywhere, has made bureaucrats more aware of how data sharing can just be...<i>done</i>. Certainly, there are always officials who will push back, because they&#x27;re power-control-freaks or because they have something to hide. But plenty of bureaucrats don&#x27;t really care...they&#x27;ve just been told by their IT people that putting up data in an easy way would cost too much and be too much of a security compromise. Now that there&#x27;s an option of a general data portal, there&#x27;s fewer reasons to say no.<p>Just to give you an idea of how technically clueless many bureaucrats are (and I don&#x27;t really blame them, but their agencies for not prioritizing tech training)...it is still not unheard of to be denied access to machine-readable data -- e.g. they <i>print out a spreadsheet</i> and fax it to you, instead of just sending you the XLS -- because they think that if they give you the spreadsheet, you can &quot;alter the data&quot;.<p>Yes, it really is that dumb.<p>edit: to the author&#x27;s credit, he&#x27;s not saying that open data portals should be closed, just that governments should move beyond them. That&#x27;s a nice sentiment, but in reality, it&#x27;s an idea that takes away resources from <i>improving</i> data portals.<p>From TFA:<p>> <i>Now we actually give that directly to Waze, so they can reroute people dynamically. Indeed, this is a good open data story — taking the data to where people are —but there’s something more interesting: it’s a two-way street. Not only does Waze now share pothole and road condition data it collects regularly through its app, they went one step further. They began to proactively collect and share data in the interest public safety.</i><p>But <i>that can already be done</i> with the existing LA data portal and its REST API. Why does the city of Los Angeles have to give Waze anything other than the GET endpoint, from which Waze engineers can download as they like. And not just Waze, but everyone else, in equal measure. So there&#x27;s nothing <i>wrong</i> with what the author wants, he just doesn&#x27;t appear to think that with APIs, developers can create far better and far more resources than what the city could do itself.<p>And no, the city (unless it has a magical source of revenue) can&#x27;t do both building out more &quot;human&quot; data applications while improving their open data pipelines. The latter has much, much further to go before the city can spend IT money on building out new apps.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-Data-RMS-Incidents/tbnj-w5hb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-D...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Bulk-Police-Narrative/inke-qqax"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Bulk-Police-Narrative/...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-Data-Unknown-Suspects/jitt-qwwh"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-D...</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://www.dallasopendata.com/dataset/Dallas-Police-Active-Calls/9fxf-t2tr"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dallasopendata.com/dataset/Dallas-Police-Active-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-Data-Officer-Involved-Shootin/4gmt-jyx2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dallasopendata.com/Police/Dallas-Police-Public-D...</a>",1451791734

10829360,comment,10828513,10829332,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"Remember that Hobbes was writing at a time when philosophers liked to consider a &quot;state of nature&quot; -- the behavior of people <i>before</i> organized society, government, etc., come into being.<p>Many of these philosophers, including John Locke (who Jefferson cribbed heavily from when writing the US Declaration of Independence), wrote as if the morals of Enlightenment-era westerners would magically naturally exist in people living in such a &quot;state of nature&quot;, and simply took them for granted.<p>Hobbes pointed out that this was balderdash. Our entire conception of propriety, of right and wrong, of what is or isn&#x27;t acceptable, comes not from some natural moral law engraved into our hearts or deduced in an ideal pre-society state of pure reason, but rather is inculcated into us by the culture in which we live. So Hobbes dismissed the idea that people would be respectful and helpful in the &quot;state of nature&quot; and pointed out that, since that stuff only comes into being later with organized society, none of it would exist at that point. Hence the war of all against all.<p>Which is where your desert-island analogy, and most other attempts to tear down Hobbes&#x27; state of nature, fall apart: your stranded people come in with experience of an organized culture which taught a particular set of morals and norms. One of those norms is that the adult should go hungry to let the child eat, but there is no guarantee that some natural moral law written in the adult&#x27;s heart would have produced the same outcome absent years of indoctrination in a particular culture&#x27;s moral system (and in fact, in <i>actual</i> nature we can find examples of animal species where adults will kill and even eat young of their own species).",1451791603

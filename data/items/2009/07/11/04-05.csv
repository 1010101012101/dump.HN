If we can prevent tropical cyclones, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and the like, then everything will be ok.<p>What such a philosophy fails to take into account is that these forces aren't <i>just</i> destructive. They represent a system that has a certain equilibrium which is maintained by periodically removing excess energy that has been introduced. Sometimes this surplus of energy is quite considerable, and so the transfer of that energy results in damage to things along the path.<p>It is possible that going the other direction might work for some things; force the energy transfer to occur more often but less severely. However, even this might have unintended consequences. Less powerful tropical cyclones may not survive to areas as far inland that may depend on their seasonal arrival for necessary rainfall.<p>I think the best thing we could do is educate people that certain things are not and will never be in our control, and that our reaction should not be panic and sensationalism but cautious respect and preparation.",1247288350

698819,comment,698754,698754,0,0,azanar,,,"This NOAA FAQ covers the infeasibility of doing this, but even if it were possible, via nuclear detonation or otherwise, there is still the conversation of whether it is wise to do so even if we could. What lasting effects this might have upon the climate?<p>As I've understood, the hurricanes that form every year are actually part of a process of advecting heat energy from the surface tropical regions to the higher altitudes and higher latitudes. I remember seeing a ocean temperature analysis just before and after Hurricane Rita traveled across the Gulf of Mexico, and the drop in ocean temperature was quite noticeable. Similar drops, to a lesser degree, can be observed with all tropical storms.<p>This process is really important to keeping temperatures around the planet more balanced that they would be otherwise. It also keeps the temperature of tropical oceans somewhat in check, so they don't spawn even more energetic cyclones later on. If we start trying to control this, there is the risk that we will screw ourselves by making tropical storms less frequent but much more severe.",1247287612

I've always been irritated by the emphasis software companies (or at least, journalists writing about software companies) put on things like free drinks and ping pong tables. Give me great work with great people and you can toss the rest of it; conversely, all that free crap doesn't do a thing for me if the work and the people aren't great.<p>At the same time, I've heard from many sources that Amazon isn't such a great place to work.

They closed Gatwick down for a day in '97 with only a phone call and forced Britain's Grand National horse race to be postponed with another, causing huge disruption, panic and anger. They got the attention they wanted but no-one lost a life. It surprises me that we don't see the tactic copied more often today.",1247287503

698803,comment,698759,698759,0,0,skolor,,,"I'm a little torn on this whole issue. While I have, for most of my life, supported full disclosure, because in general I feel that proprietary information, of any kind, is bad (for society, not the person controlling the information), recently I've started to agree that something needs to be done about the state of computer security.<p>The problem lies in the fact that computer software has no real automatic failure point. If you buy a car that was poorly designed, and had many flaws, you will find out soon enough when it breaks down. Software won't do that. Once it works, it will keep working for the most part. Yes, it will slowly lose performance if not designed right, but you rarely have catastrophic failure.<p>The full disclosure movement had an amazing effect on computer security. It made developers accountable for their code. Developers had to come to terms with the fact that code, by nature of existing, is not secure, it does not exist in a vacuum, and, because of that, cannot be left alone indefinitely. In essence, full disclosure created a security field, and made software development better because of it.<p>However, full disclosure doesn't seem to work any more (at least not the way it is currently done). Simply releasing any and all exploits found makes it easier for anyone to exploit software. When the people running software were experts, and kept on top of keeping their software updated, patched and secure, that wasn't a bad thing. It forced manufacturers to release patches in a timely manner, since people using their code would be expecting the patch. Some place in the past decade and a half, that shifted. Everyone runs software now, and, generally, are the people responsible for keeping it secure.<p>Optional security patches, when the exploits are publicly available, are not an option. Look at Conficker: the patch actually created interest in the exploit, which created the most recent major security related scare, simply because the patch to fix it was optional, and (evidently) millions of computer operators never took that option. With the huge demand for software, finding skilled, well educated programmers is often not an option. This leads to security issues that developers don't even understand, or even know where to start patching.<p>Like wise, zero disclosure is also not an option. If zero-day exploits sold in a black market become the norm, it makes it so that only highly organized criminals, or security organizations with deep pockets, will know how exploits work.<p>The script-kiddie phenomenon is reaching a critical point. When running a bot-net, stealing identities, and all sorts of ""hacking"" activities require a skill set that qualifies you for a secretary position, something needs to be done about it. Software developers are not testing software adequately. End-users are not patching adequately.<p>While I don't agree with zero-disclosure, hopefully a shift towards less disclosure may make developers start taking security more seriously from the start. For most users, patching will rarely, if ever, happen. Once developers can't claim that someone else will find security holes later, and hope the users patch them, they may have to start making sure the code they first ship meets some kind of security standards.<p>They're right. Full disclosure is shifting responsibility away from developers, and onto ""security"" companies and end users. This is not an inherently good thing, and is currently become a bad thing very quickly.",1247286031

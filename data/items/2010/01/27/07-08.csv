And actually there were only about 40MB left since the OS needed some memory for itself too.<p>Personally i thought that with better resources management i could do much more, so i wrote a custom HTTP server in that could fit in less than one MB of RAM.

Litigation and smear campaigns are far more likely.<p>I think the mainstream press wouldn't bother to describe details about an obscure option hidden deep within the system settings, and would likely have whatever was the most sensational, intellectually dishonest headline they could get away with coupled with some vague, useless security tips like locking your phone with a pin and making sure bluetooth is turned off in crowded places.<p>People don't have their bank accounts emptied (usually, except via phishing websites and Android Marketplace apps) because their computers aren't intrinsically linked to their credit cards. Phones are, and it would be completely trivial (and very tempting) to make a dialer.exe type program that surreptitiously makes $9.95/min calls to Nigeria. List it as some kind of a raunchy sex line and try pleading innocence to your telco about that one. Go on, I dare you.<p>Another point: on a PC, data is stored kind of haphazardly and if you have nefarious objectives in mind it's a lot more difficult to access very specific kinds of information.

That is the kind of thought that geeks are accustomed to, but to non-geeks, that's what they do at work, not for pleasure (exceptions abound, though.

P is the usual base point for the curve; an arbitrary point Q is provided without justification or details of its generation.<p>Because the NIST curves have cofactor 1, all points other than the identity generate the same subgroup. This means any two points P and Q are related by some scalar d such that d * P = Q. Knowledge of d is the back door in the generator.<p>This also implies a simple means for choosing Q given P: pick a random integer d and calculate Q = d * P. Publish P and Q and then write down d someplace safe. This is exactly how NSA is speculated to have chosen the Dual EC parameters.<p>However, the NIST document also specifies a method for generating alternative points. It boils down to hashing a random seed and mapping the result to a curve point. If you generate the base points P and Q like this, the relationship between them is unknown. The scalar d still exists, but now no one knows what it is. Without that knowledge, there is no back door.<p>It&#x27;s not clear from that page how Juniper chose the parameters. Maybe they did choose a random scalar and multiply P, or maybe they followed the standard. The information on that page isn&#x27;t enough to say one way or the other.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying this isn&#x27;t something to worry about.

MGP Ingredients, formerly Midwest Grain Products, formerly Midwest Solvents, is in Atcheson, Kansas, and Pekin, Illinois. What comes out of MGP is plain ethanol, in railroad tank cars.  Some of it goes to beverage plants, and some of it goes to refineries to be added to gasoline.[2]  They do not use &quot;barrels&quot;. They use tank farms. This is MGP&#x27;s distillery in Atcheson, Kansas in StreetView.[1]  It looks like a small oil refinery.<p>MGP is up front about this.  Check out this StreetView picture of a tank in their tank farm.[4]  The tank is clearly labeled &quot;192 Proof Alcohol - 200,000 Gallon Capacity&quot;.  That&#x27;s usable either for powering flex-fuel cars, or as feedstock for booze makers.  Check out their rail yard, with dozens of tank cars full of alcohol.[5] (The ones inside the security fence are probably full and ready to go; the ones outside are empties waiting to be loaded.)  This is how it&#x27;s made.<p>One of the big consumers of MGP ethanol is Frank-Lin Distillers&#x27; Products, which used to be in San Jose near the rail yard and is now in Fairfield, CA, where they are next door to a bottle plant and have their own railroad siding.  Frank-Lin makes about two thousand different alcohol-based products.[3] Some they sell themselves; some are outsourced brands made for others.  They used to make SKYY Vodka. SKYY was an entirely outsourced operation; the SKYY company itself just handled marketing and sales.  (SKYY later sold out to Campari, which moved production to some Campari plant.)<p>Frank-Lin takes in ethanol and does some additional re-distillation. They have a water de-ionizing plant which takes in city water.  They mix water, alcohol, and flavoring, then bottle, using a highly automated bottling line which can switch bottle types without a shutdown.  Out of their plant come brandy, whiskey, vodka, rum, tequila, and even wine brands. &quot;With an annual production capability of 15 million cases and on-premise tank storage capacity in excess of 1,500,000 gallons, Frank-Lin has the facilities and expertise to efficiently handle any project. Frank-Lin is a provider of contract bottling services for major national spirit brand owners.&quot;<p>Frank-Lin also handles distribution. They have an advantage in this - they&#x27;re not a distiller. US law requires three independent tiers - distillers/brewers, distributors, and retailers.  Usually, that means a distiller makes and bottles an end-user product and sells it to a distributor, who sells it to a retailer. But Frank-Lin is considered a distributor - they buy their alcohol already distilled. So they get to remove one layer of middlemen.  Since they ship to almost every liquor store in the western US, it doesn&#x27;t cost them much more to add brands.<p>That&#x27;s how the booze industry really works.  All else is hype.<p>[1] <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/dQifXrzdWMH2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/dQifXrzdWMH2</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.mgpingredients.com/alcohol/beverage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mgpingredients.com/alcohol/beverage/</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://www.frank-lin.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.frank-lin.com/</a>\n[4] <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/c92moNiXDGx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/c92moNiXDGx</a>\n[5] <a href=""https://goo.gl/maps/h5t3AeDhZ1U2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/maps/h5t3AeDhZ1U2</a>",1450560179

The prose is very readable and narratively engaging, but the information is pretty dense, and it&#x27;s easy to get sidetracked following a citation for the full version of a particular story or anecdote. It took me eight months to read, and I am a pretty quick reader. For the breadth and depth, I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot out there that can compare.<p>That said, you can very seldom go wrong with the classics. There&#x27;s a lot of modern works out there, and textbook-type treatments, of course, but I personally find contemporary texts the most interesting and engaging. You get a firsthand account of how people long ago lived and thought.<p>Caesar, as referenced upthread with The Gallic Wars, wrote a lot about his campaigns. My personal favorites have been Plutarch&#x27;s Lives of Noble Greeks and Romans, which is nominally about comparing the characters of selected pairs of Greeks and Romans, but gives you windows into the historical times they lived in as well, and though not Roman, Thucydides&#x27;s History of the Peloponnesian War.<p>For a lighter treatment, I listened to and would recommend Dan Carlin&#x27;s Hardcore History podcast series after seeing it mentioned on Hacker News several times. There&#x27;s two great series about Rome, Punic Nightmares and Death Throes of the Republic. Carlin does a good job of really bringing to the fore that same kind of thing, I think, that gives a real sense of how the people at the time were thinking and feeling, and he&#x27;s clearly passionate about history.<p>What really stands out to me is how little has changed. We really are just another chapter or two. Technology has advanced, but <i>people</i> and culture has really changed very slowly and so clearly builds on what came before. The West in general is still very much a blend of Roman culture syncretized with the Germanic tribes. It&#x27;s really fascinating to me how incredibly similar people were thousands of years ago. They had very different belief systems and values, but otherwise it&#x27;s staggering how you have all these thousands of years of very, very smart people doing different things for different reasons, and seeing how that led to our times, and how we&#x27;re doing the very similar things right now and laying out the future for those who will come after us and one day, hopefully, read about us.<p>(Little things that struck me and I thought of while writing those posts: the class warfare in Rome with e.g. the Gracchi brothers, compared to our economic problems in the past ~150 years; the political environment in Athens surrounding the Sicilian Expedition, compared to that of our Iraq War; and the incredible courage it must have taken for people to stand in an orderly line and watch people run towards them screaming with swords in hand.)",1450559834

Well, that can&#x27;t really happen.<p>Another issue is locking - consider this version, for example:<p>WITH x AS (SELECT a, b FROM t FOR UPDATE)\nSELECT * FROM x x1 JOIN x x2 ON (x1.a  = x2.b);<p>In other words, it&#x27;s way more complicated than it might seem, especially if you can&#x27;t break existing uses (e.g. the locking).",1450559715

But if that is the case, the people who are most intelligent by this definition are far from the ones recognized as intelligent by the AI-fearing community. Let me put it this way: Albert Einstein and Richard Feynman would not be among them. Adolf Hitler, on the other hand, would be a genius.<p>How so? Feynman in particular was quite able to continually accomplish his goals, and he purposely chose divergent goals to test himself (his whole &quot;I&#x27;ll be a biologist this summer&quot; thing).<p>And yes, see my original comment re: it takes intelligence to walk into the DAP meeting and join as member 55 and come out conquering mainland Europe.<p>>I do, however, don&#x27;t understand what you mean by &quot;a massive issue&quot;.

This is how most innovation happens, but here it could be very dangerous, because...<p>>What I fail to see is compelling arguments why AI is any more dangerous or any more imminent than hundreds of bigger, more imminent threats.<p>AI could totally destabilize our society in a matter of hours. Our infrastructure is barely secure against human attackers, and it could be totally obliterated by an AI that chose to do that, or incidentally caused it to happen. An AI might not be able to launch nukes directly (in the US at least, who knows what the Russians have hooked up to computers), but it could almost certainly make it seem to any nuclear power that another nuclear power had launched a nuclear attack. There actually are places that will just make molecules you send them, so if the AI figures out protein folding, it could wipe out humanity with a virus.<p>AI is more dangerous than most things, because it has:<p>* limitless capability for action<p>* near instantaneous ability to act<p>The second one is really key; there&#x27;s nearly nothing that would make shit hit the fan FASTER than a hostile AI.<p>If you have a list of hundreds of bigger, more imminent threats, that can take humanity from 2015 to 20000BCE in a day, I&#x27;d like to see it.<p>>I doubt you would say their defining quality is intelligence.<p>I&#x27;m confused as to how you can read three comments of &quot;intelligence is the ability to accomplish goals&quot; and then say &quot;people who have chosen to become politically powerful and accomplished that goal must not be people you consider intelligent.&quot;<p>>You wouldn&#x27;t say they are of average intelligence, but I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d recognize their intelligence as being superior.<p>Well, they can exploit people. How&#x27;s that for superiority?<p>My background is admittedly in cognitive psychology, not clinical, but I do see your point here.

10764829,comment,10763874,10764566,0,0,calinet6,,,"That&#x27;s a good point, but it has two issues you should consider.<p>First, the industrial world <i>also</i> had significant issues with project definition and understanding. The problems were not already solved, and the process, inputs, outputs and the whole system was constantly changing. Every project was already about problem solving and scoping. So there&#x27;s a bit of rose-colored glasses toward the past here.<p>Second, the idea that time estimation is no longer applicable is probably off. There are two separate problems: problem definition, and problem solving, and estimation is extremely useful in the latter. Problem definition is a different problem that still needs much focus, but it doesn&#x27;t preclude the need for better understanding of time to coordinate other processes and dependencies. You might be saying that those dependencies aren&#x27;t as important as we think, and I tend to agree, but that&#x27;s a different argument.<p>Generally speaking, the idea that knowledge and skills from the industrial era are no longer applicable is untrue. There is a huge body of knowledge about how products are made and built that have 99% applicability to software and technology in the post-industrial world. This is because the problems are the same: management of people, leadership, understanding interactions within complex systems, understanding statistics (the importance of which this article proves profoundly), and improving the spread of knowledge. This is the way that Toyota began operating in the post-WWII era, the way W. Edwards Deming modeled companies, and the way that the current Lean movement guides you to improve almost any business. It&#x27;s highly relevant.<p>The main point we should take away, is that time and estimates are not constraints on a system; but rather outputs that are predictable and follow statistical patterns. We can use those outputs to make better decisions, especially if we understand the whole process of production in a systemic way.<p>Estimation need not die.

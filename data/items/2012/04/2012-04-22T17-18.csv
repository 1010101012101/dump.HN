This is no ordinary amplifier, and I don't think you can simply compare it to an amplifier with a ""unique case"".<p>This is what I would call, if you'll forgive me, <i>transparent</i> design. Obviously I'm not talking about the just the case. The mechanism of action of modern electronics is hidden behind 6-layer printed circuit boards and integrated circuit packages. Opening up an iPhone gives precious little insight into its workings. You wind up googling datasheets instead of following traces.<p>This is a tactile product. A 6-year old could pick up this amp, ask a few pointed questions about what they see inside, and actually have a prayer of figuring out how it works. I know I would sit there for cumulative hours just turning it over and watching the image of the components refracted through the faces. With everything stripped away, the noise becomes the signal  the imperfections in the solder joints, slight tool marks on the leads, the banded resistors that have gone out of style.<p>Yeah, there are people that would pay quite a bit for this, even if they're not audiophiles.",1335117591

This is very particular to YC.<p>Perhaps you didn't realize, but a successful application to Y-Combinator gets an average investment from YC of <i>$18k.</i><p>(""Twice a year we invest a small amount of money (average $18k) in a large number of startups"" <a href=""http://ycombinator.com/."" rel=""nofollow"">http://ycombinator.com/.</a>)<p>18,000 for the whole company.<p>Let's look at it if you don't have a ""technical cofounder=coder"" who is part of the team getting the 18,000.<p>Now you have to put some of the 18,000 toward coding.<p>Now it is generally acknowledged that the total cost to a company of a worker is about double the stated salary.<p>So, 18k will get you 9k worth of salary.  But of course you have all kinds of miscellaneous expenses associated with setting up a company!<p>Like paying for hosting, or a space to work.<p>Maybe you can reduce ALL of your other expenses to 20% of the investment, so that you're left with 80% of the investment (a preposterously large amount) that you can use on a coder.   This is 14.4k.<p>This equals a 7.2K of salary (remember, you double stated salary to get actual cost to your company).<p>This is how much coding you get for 7.2k.<p>0.09 years = 1.44 months at 60k annual salary rate, or<p>0.15 years = 1.08 months at 80k annaul salary rate, or<p>0.125 years = 0.9 months at 96k annual salary rate.<p>At forty hours, you are getting:<p>230 hours at 60k, or<p>172.8 hours at 80k or<p>144 hours at 96k.<p>This is two weeks of crunch development time.  And this is if you can give 80% of your investment to an outside coder.<p>Does this sound reasonable?<p>Also bear in mind that contractors are more expensive than salaried positions.  And, if you have no coder on board, in other words you need a complete architect and CTO, then you are looking at the very highest end of that range.<p>And all this is you spent 80% of your investment on an outside coder.<p>To me, it would seem fair to say that you have more like half of your investment that you can possibly spend up-front on an outside developer, bringing those numbers to...<p>143.75 hours at 60k, or<p>108 hours at 80k or<p>90 hours at 96k.<p>Do you think you can hire a guy to build your next eBay-of-x for you in 90-140 hours to the point where it <i>GENERATES ENOUGH PROFIT FOR YOU TO KEEP PAYING HIM?</i><p>Absolutely out of the question.<p>This is why, in particular, the Y-C formula <i>requires</i> a technical cofounder as defined in this blog post.<p>It's very particular to YC, because they expect you to get a company off the ground for about as much as a traditional company would spend on office space rent in three or four months.<p>Y-Combinator's formula just doesn't work without a ""technical co-founder"" working for equity.<p>Entrepreneurship is simply not enough, when all you have is 18k to work with spread among every single cost the company will have, until it's profitable enough to pay for coders: who are very expensive.",1335117540

It was bad lawyers who can't write plain English, and picky people at the FSF who tried to fine-tune everything instead of stating a clear guiding principle.<p>There are plenty of other licences that are very much shorter.</i><p>Well, unlike permissive licenses, the GPL is an hack on the copyright system; they probably wanted to make sure it would hold up in court.<p>But the GPL isn't really that long; the 2.0 is only 340 lines of 80 characters. Yeah, it's long compared to MIT, but it's still a fraction of most legal documents.<p><i>Firstly, I suspect that a lot of people use the GPL not because they like or understand it but because it was the peer pressure ""what you do"" option for a while.

Yes, we were certainly worse off for it. If you mean Freeware as a different concept, well, then it's easy to see why licenses are useful - they clearly define that stuff, so you can sleep at night knowing your business or webapp or whatever won't get sued to the ground tomorrow.<p><i>Secondly, it's not really a standard when there are at least three styles of GPL licence that come up reasonably often in discussions (GPL, LGPL, AGPL) and then there's the whole v2/v3 mess as well.</i><p>The differences between the three versions are minimal - a clause or two more, nothing else.<p>The v2 vs v3 issue is problematic, I agree. On the other hand, protection against software patents is important. MIT, for example, provides none.<p>It seems irrelevant 'till you get hit by a patent troll, like startups are already getting hit.<p><i>Finally, while I respect the goal of trying to have some standardised licensing, the only standard I've observed in practice is that, unless you're working in an organsation where everyone values GPL-style licensing and uses it as an integral part of your business model, the lawyers and managers are likely to blanket ban any use of GPL'd code because the risk of the viral contamination effect is too high to justify any benefit from using it.</i><p>True. But unlicensed or implied licensing is dangerous too - you need <i>some</i> kind of legalese.<p><i>On the other hand, it's easy and feels safe to reuse code that comes with a no-nonsense BSD/MIT style licence that says in plain English that you can use the code without understanding several pages of legalese with subtle implications. That saves time.</i><p>Wait till you base your company on someone else's MIT licensed code and then get hit by a patent lawsuit from them or a troll with their patents. Safe?

What if I'm just getting a little bit less playful every day?<p>With achievement I feel like you have an internal zero point that you measure from. But the zero has a dangerous tendency to climb. When I was a child I felt like the zero was at, well, zero. People got impressed if I just managed to fall over with gusto. Now I'm a proper software developer and aspiring startup guy, the zero is more like being well paid writing good code for successful projects that make an impact but are also somehow deeply meaningful, about which I make clever insights while blogging, tweeting, plussing and getting a million internet points on Hacker News.<p>Even if it's not quite that bad, expectations build up pretty quickly, and it's easy to end up worried about being in the negative. Why can't it all just be positive? Imagine if you could return to the days when just getting something to compile was a victory that would stay with you for days. I don't really know if it's possible, but I have been making some attempts to try.<p>I read a book on Stoicism that was referenced on Tim Ferriss's blog (that he writes from the deck of his jumbo yacht on the shores of lake always successful), and it actually had a lot of great stuff to say about how to stop expectations wrecking your happiness. But even armed with the ability to bring up Marcus Aurelius at dinner parties, it's tough going. I've cut down to one day a week of work (and pretty fun work with a low responsibility factor) on the theory that I should undersubscribe myself for a while and let myself naturally gravitate towards things I like without an expectation they'll be my life's work, or even very good at all.<p>That's meant I've spent a lot more time doing things, but I still feel a sense of residual nervousness that things I do will be bad. My website, for example, has been blank page for nigh unto half a decade now, just because I want to write something good on there and I'm not sure whatever I write will be good. Old habits die hard, I guess.<p>Having written this now I look back and it seems long and rambly without any particular point other than what goes through my head when I think about that part of Feynman's book. I feel an overwhelming urge to go back and tidy it up, try to tie it all into a nice conclusion or something. Maybe that's the point, though. Can't I just be proud of the fact that I wrote something without worrying that I should be able to do better? Maybe we're all standing around worried but nobody says anything because it would ruin our carefully tended never-fail image. Alright, I'm going to post it. Here goes...",1335116716

It's from this comment on Slashdot in August 2010:<p><a href=""http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1764528&cid=33356394"" rel=""nofollow"">http://apple.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1764528&cid=33...</a><p>The parent comment to the comment had said this (about Steve Jobs):<p>""Pedantic note. He didn't revolutionalize anything. His company may have. He may have been the final say on the design and implementation decisions, but he didn't do it. The engineers did. The researchers did. The programmers did. Just because he's the one standing on the stage during a keynote doesn't mean that he really did anything (I'm not saying he didn't, but I'm saying that just because he takes credit doesn't mean he deserves to take credit)...""<p>And the full response to this comment (I only quoted half), was:<p>""Leaders are generally given credit for accomplishments. Napoleon didn't personally conquer northern Italy.""<p>It's an interesting contrast to your statement, because although Napoleon might have been able to set up artillery and weild a sabor, <i>Steve Jobs was not an engineer.</i>  (This is what Bill Gates said recently about him).  If you really want to get into it, his deepest credentials, very early in adolescence, in engineering, came from having his buddy working the night shift developing for him, and his claiming the results.  He <i>literally</i> could not do what he wanted/needed to, and literally had to have his friend help him.<p>So I don't know about whether Napoleon personally cleaned bores, or knew the intricacies of every job, but it is fair to say that Steve Jobs could not do what he wanted done early on, and for the past few decades certainly couldn't do <i>any</i> of the jobs the engineers were doing.<p>I think you also completely miss the sweet meaning of ""personally"", which forms a nice mental image.  You say he was perfectly capable of stepping in when he needed to.  But obviously, he could not have stepped in for the whole army.  Just because he had the ability to do any of the jobs (even if that's true), does that mean he could do every one of the jobs all at once.<p>In the YC sense of a startup, frequently the ""technical cofounder"" or CTO can literally go ahead and ""step in"" <i>for the whole army!</i><p>With literally not a single other person having any access to the servers, the ""technical cofounder"" can keep the operations running and make updates ""personally"".

The pervasive interruptions is true, but tying it to online vs. non-online conversation I'm more skeptical of, and seems to be some kind of nostalgia for an idealized era of intellectual discussion in the cafe that few people ever really experienced.<p>The article has an assumption sort of carried throughout, which I thought we had pretty much ditched in the 1990s, that online=shallow and IRL=deep, for various pop-linguistics reasons involving the supposed inability of textual conversation to carry nuance or emotion. I don't think studies have borne that out; among people who are ""text fluent"", i.e. regularly use real-time text chat for in-depth conversations, you find the usual range of linguistic features, including non-explicit conveyance of information, emotion, etc. There seems to be a persistent myth that text chat is equivalent to sending telegrams back and forth or something, which is only approximately true for people who have never developed any real experience or fluency with the medium (it <i>does</i> feel like that when I'm chatting online with my parents, who aren't really internet people, so I prefer to call/Skype them instead).<p>I haven't found a clear online vs. offline dividing line in terms of which supports ""real"" conversations in my own friendships. With some people it's more one, with others more of the other. My closest friends are people I talk to extensively via both modalities, and you tend to get different sides of people through each.<p>If anything, though, I would say I have somewhat more ""real"" conversations online. Maybe it's just who I end up being close friends with, but I find people are a little less guarded online, and actually <i>worse</i> at faking/masking emotion. Two of my friends in particular are very good at putting on an official face in person, such that even if you know them well it's hard to figure out what exactly they're thinking if they don't want you to. But online, when I talk to them regularly, it's nearly <i>instantly</i> obvious when they're in a bad mood or something is bugging them, by the way the cadence and subtleties of the conversation change, or change when specific things are mentioned. The changes are as much in what's omitted or different from usual as what's explicitly present in the text. But supposedly all those nuances don't exist!",1335115204

They ask the owner of ""Facebook.com"" for the domain.<p>One of the following two things might happen:<p>1. The owner is a domain squatter and sells it to thefacebook.com for $5000.<p>2. The owner is a 13 year old kid who bought the domain and put a couple of pictures of his cat's faces on it. as well a couple of adsense ads. Refuses to sell for anything less than 0.5 million dollars because he really likes the domain name.<p>Arguably in this case the domain squatter did provide some value to society. The thing with squatters is they are always willing to sell for the right price. Other types of domain owners are not so predictable. In particular, domains with established businesses are unlikely (I'm guessing) to sell for anything less than the value of the entire business, even though that business may be less profitable and less value-adding than a business proposed by a potential acquirer of the domain. If the domain was squatted instead, the less profitable business may not have bought it at all, leaving it for the more profitable business.<p>Whether this value is significant enough to be respected is another question, but I have no doubt that it does exist.",1335114916

They aren't. However, (bad) non-technical folk are quick to lose sight of how much their business or ideas are reliant on the technical prowess of someone else. It's not just ""writing code"" - it's coming up with the overall architecture, understanding how it will scale, being able to come up with something that won't fall apart the moment it gets released to the public. If this was easy, outsourcing would be a lot more common in the field and programmers would not have the sort of pay they do.<p>Non-technical skills are important. However, technical expertise is the difference between an idea and a product. Both are critical in order to achieve fantastic things.

The title of Appendix Table A-1 from which I quoted is ""Domestic Inmigration, Outmigration, and Net Migration: 1995 to 2000.""  It's simply the first link I found and as such it's not the same time period as the WSJ article's subject.  But I figured it was a data point that at least superficially corroborated their admittedly-unknown underlying data.  By that, I mean that it provided sufficient credibility to their discussion and confirmed it was a matter of migration and not population.  From there, I considered their conclusions at least plausible.<p>You say, ""There is always a natural tendency for some people to go from populated areas to less populated areas.""<p>According to the 2007 data represented at the URL below (which I have not traced to its source, but I wouldn't be surprised if it too leverages Census data in some fashion), there does not seem to be much correlation between population and migration.<p><a href=""http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/12/17/u-s-migration-flows/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2008/12/17/u-s-migration-flow...</a>  (Warning: Flash required)<p>The greatest net outmigration is Alaska with a net migration of -60,000 and a population of 683,000.  Meanwhile, many states with populations between 5M and 20M had net inmigration.<p>While it seems plausible that there could be a natural tendency to migrate from high population to low population; the reverse seems just as plausible.  California had a relatively high population when it had net positive migration.  Texas currently has a high population and a net positive migration.<p>It seems clear to me that more significant variables are at play than just a desire to switch density levels.<p>Are those causes dysfunctions?  Maybe; I suppose it depends on what you consider dysfunctional.  Another poster in this thread pointed out that California's Proposition 13 is a distorting influence.  Is it dysfunctional?

Sadly if people do not question the validity the origin of the question comes from then we're all just going to go around talking about what ""we think/imagine"".<p>The last point is the greatest danger to us - assumptions.",1335114336

It seemed challenging the get files to your main computer...but they were cheap and durable.<p>I ended up buying a ""PocketMail"" for very little money.  It was such a wonderful email device.  I was traveling a lot and could write emails for weeks on 2 AA batteries.  Then I'd hold the handset to a free payphone call to send/receive.

The point he meant to get across is that that's a nitpick, not a huge problem, but he spends several paragraphs explaining the problem and only a few sentences explaining that it's just a minor nitpick and overall the experience is good.

So for me it would make more sense to build a mode (on top of the new codebase) that would mimic the old design instead of implementing fixes one-by-one. Then everyone who liked the old design better could just change one setting that is easy to find and be done instead of playing with bunch of individual settings in different menus to achieve the same thing. I think it would stop a lot of complaints even if it would not be perfect.<p>I understand that there might be very good reasons why it is not feasible, this is just my 2 cents.",1335114134

8496980,comment,8494947,8496528,0,0,MaKleSoft,,,"I agree. In my opinion most password managers focus too much on delivering features that nobody really needs (most of the time at least) and far too little on user experience and polish. This is, I think, one of the reasons why so few non-technical people bother with using a password manager. I&#x27;ve been working on my own open source solution, which puts a clear focus on simplicity and usability[1]. I wish other companies like LastPass and 1Password would start putting more effort in making their software more accessible to non-technical users rather than trying to out-feature their competitors.<p>[1] <a href=""http://padlock.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://padlock.io/</a>",1414047164

He explained to me that Twitter only cares about one metric: growth.<p>In particular they are hyper-focused on signing up new Twitter users and then &quot;on-boarding&quot; them so that they can follow other users, posts tweets etc. within the first session. That means that products using the Twitter platform need to be focused on that too.<p>Twitter wanted to position themselves around three core features:<p>* the feed itself\n* the platform (recent third-party hooks/features such as voting (World Cup) and payments (Stripe et al) are part of this)\n* developer tools<p>It was explained to me that the latter was needed because too often Twitter felt that social/twitter features were &quot;bolted on&quot; too often at the end of projects, meaning that the integration was naturally segregated from the other features.<p>Twitter felt that for developers to create products that were inherently social, they would need to provide the tools to build those products themselves, and that social integration would be encouraged early in the product development cycle.<p>Fabric appears to be the first output of this strategy.",1414047138

8496960,comment,8491487,8496843,0,0,belorn,,,"The 1976 Copyright Act did not address how copyright were to protect software. Congress didn’t want to further delay the passage of the Act and appointed the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to report back about computer programs and other new technologies and placed a placeholder provision in the Act. It was about a far from current copyright law that you can make it. You could register a copyright, but if it had any practical effect was up to congress to solidify in 1980.<p>Anyhow, I agree with jefurii comment. Public domain software, that is software that did not get copyright licenses added to them, was the norm before proprietary software. The free software movement was thus an reaction to the change of adding proprietary licenses to software and would not exist if that change had not happened. If people continued to not license software after 1980, along side the proprietary movement and the free software movement, is an interesting question to ask, and would be interesting to know if there is historical data about it.",1414046646

There is a spectrum of practices which scholarship athletes typically use.  Some are simple, practical and pretty much above reproach -- taking the fewest credits allowable during the season; taking academically rigorous course over the summer.  Some start to get questionable -- at what point does intensive tutoring become the tutor actually doing the work.    And then are no show classes and fake grades.<p>It&#x27;s possible to be a scholarship athlete and get a real academic degree.  I&#x27;ve seen people do it first hand.  But it&#x27;s hard -- you need to start with a decent academic background, and then work your ass off and most likely the social aspect of your college time will suffer.<p>That being said, even without the best academic background its possible to legitimately graduate if there is institutional support for it.  The student might not have the most rigorous undergraduate course work, but they will have earned a degree equivalent to many non-athletes at the school.  But for this to happen there needs to be institutional support both inside and outside the athletic department.<p>What&#x27;s disturbing to me about UNC, is not just that they knowingly and persistently cheated, but that there behavior was purely and most basely exploitative -- they weren&#x27;t even pretending to educate these students.",1414045123

In the mean time, I lost all my programming skills. I now don&#x27;t have any programming skills what so ever.&quot;<p>If you are expecting to pick up a new language you cannot expect to code at the same speed as the programming language you have been working on for quite a while with. But that is not necessarily a bad thing.<p>C/C++ have huge changes in the language updates as well so it is not too suprising if you think you have unlearned some of them. In retrospect maybe you just learned some of the algorithms rather than just learning the languages themselves when doing the languages. To re-learn them i&#x27;d look at more used libraries for C++ like libmusl and be aware that real programming is not all about just algorithms.<p>Instead of picking a new programming language to learn maybe you should learn a bit more about the &quot;ecosystems&quot; of languages. While almost all programming languages are good at almost everything, there are a few special &quot;sweetspots&quot; of coding in specific languages.<p>Some example questions you should pay attention to:\nWhy are some programming languages used more than others for specific situations?\nWhat is the difference between a scripting language and a normal functional programming language?<p>Some of those questions have somewhat obvious answers. Many of the languages now are specialized in a few things. Erlang is great for passing data around. Rust is good for recoverability with a server. Go is good for concurrency patterns (but fails on some degree where concurrency patterns are not just steady/simple). Ocaml is good for security based programming because it is a static language(one instruction/way of executing for most of the language) it is also used entirely by at least one company that operates in the space of trading. Python is good for computing with numbers because it automatically can handle large numbers and can be easily convereted to C/C++.<p>I&#x27;d suggest learning the ecosystem of what drives what in a specific category. For instance do you want to get into machine learning? reverse engineering? devops (automated deployment)? Picking some skillset that is out there already that is highly valued and then learning about programming languages by viewing what companies are doing is a good way to learn. You see business decisions that are made based on programming language, time, money constraints, and it&#x27;s not all just about what they just had at the time for the bigger tech companies because if it sucked they re-coded it.<p>If you have any specific questions you can ask away below.",1414044082

There&#x27;s nothing in trademark law that says it&#x27;s OK to use these tactics to combat the issue. Why would there be? The two are completely orthogonal to each other. If there are chips out there that emulate FTDI and do not have the logo, FTDI has most certainly broken the law.

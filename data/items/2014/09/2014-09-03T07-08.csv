8261923,comment,8258255,8259923,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Typesafe has been moving to stabilize Scala, primarily to make it more attractive to enterprise clients.</i><p>I work primarily for startups and have been using Scala for the last 3 years. Typesafe is entirely in the right to want to deliver a more stable Scala, not just for some mythical enterprise, but for all people using Scala for real-world projects. And this is because people complained about the lack of stability. This isn&#x27;t just because Typesafe has products to sell, it&#x27;s also because if you want a language to succeed, then it needs to cater to real world concerns.<p>Lets compare the situation with Clojure for example - with which you can usually use a library created for Clojure 1.1 and that hasn&#x27;t been updated in years and that&#x27;s still usable on top of the latest Clojure version.<p>Personally I&#x27;m happy that this fork happens, because:<p><pre><code>     1. if it adds any good features, they&#x27;ll be merged, \n        and that&#x27;s what open-source is about\n\n     2. if it fails, then there&#x27;s no harm done\n</code></pre>\nOn the other hand I do not have faith in the ability of the Typelevel people to pull this off. Like every time I tried playing with Scalaz, I ended up with stack-overflow errors - not to diminish their skill or efforts, as yes, they are amongst the very best developers, but these people are too idealistic to address the needs of projects that solve real world problems.<p>Miles himself speaks with contempt about Play and Akka and their Java compatibility - but other project leaders have a lot to learn from these projects, as they provide a blueprint for how to achieve success - a documentation first effort, reasonable stability, gradual learning curve, a sane deprecation process, mindfulness about the platform they run on and so on. Compare with Lift. Or Scalaz.",1409730684

The DSM is not a theoretical framework, it&#x27;s a diagnostic tool to match symtopms with known disorders, and it&#x27;s constantly evolving. As long as we don&#x27;t know everything about the mind or presume to know everything, there will be people who have mental problems which cannot be neatly categorised. Of course it&#x27;s important to keep improving the categories and not have too many catch-all diagnoses being made, but ultimately when the data doesn&#x27;t fit the model the solution is to improve the model, not dismiss the data.",1409730651

8261906,comment,8260498,8260938,2,0,radiac,,,"How good are Django 1.7 migrations at detecting things which have already happened? In particular, can you safely maintain South migrations alongside Django ones, or do you have to force users to switch?<p>The problem I envisage is that when you add 1.7 support to your app, you move your old migrations into south_migrations and start a clean migrations dir, as the instructions say - but what happens when your next release makes a database change? If you want to support all active versions (1.4, 1.6 and 1.7) you&#x27;d have to add a South migration and a 1.7 migration to support both groups of users - but then they no longer have a clean upgrade path from South to 1.7.<p>From reading the docs, it looks like 1.7 schema migrations may detect the changes have already been made and skip over them, but what will happen when you have data migrations too?<p>Does 1.7 figure out which operation you&#x27;re up to by comparing your migrations to the database state, and starting migrations once the two match? What if at some point you return to an older set of model fields - does it match on the earliest or the latest?<p>I plan on avoiding the issue as long as possible: get my apps as feature complete as possible under South (with instructions for 1.7+ users for creating their own migrations), then bump the version when I switch from South to Django migrations. I&#x27;ll then try to backport bugfixes to the South version (as long as they don&#x27;t change the db) until support for Django 1.4 and 1.6 are dropped.",1409730167

In many instances, it makes going to work almost pointless because it eats 50%+ of your paycheck. So, why not a crowdsourcing service (a la mechanical turk/crowdflower) that employs single mothers at home in the United States? (personally I think people would eat that up and even pay a premium for US-based workers)<p>Veterans could also do crowdsourcing work, on-demand security, and on-demand driving/moving off the top of my head.<p>Yet another way to tackle this could be to go into an industry that already has the means/access to help these people and partner with them. I&#x27;m mainly thinking of education. California&#x27;s community colleges (there are over 100) cater to these people already. They have night classes and veterans offices.

My take on this (utterly my own opinion) is that immigrants are less likely to get jobs, so more likely to start their own businesses.<p>So the people who are going to solve these problems are probably not going to be VC&#x27;s, Ivy leaguers, incubators, or in Silicon Valley. They&#x27;re probably going to be bootstrapping (nice bonus: if you&#x27;re used to living on a very low income then bootstrapping is a lot easier).

(note: while we are an actual company the software side of things is very ""indie"" so a lot of this stuff applies)<p>It's a pain because managers can be really awkward sometimes if their ass appears to be in any way on the line - one piece of software we offer manages the auditing of classified material and, for obvious reasons, selling it has been <i>hard</i> (even though pretty much every company is just using a NAS with the files on it....)<p>It's a dream because apart from the odd manager you can predict exactly how everyone at the company will react (from legal through to tech). After about 10 sales you will be able to pitch it in a way that leaves them with no questions :D<p>Regarding this article...<p><i>Please read this 100 page document about our invoicing process.</i><p>We've actually had success just saying ""I'm sorry this will incur an extra admin cost of X, if you like this is how we generally invoice..."". All these companies like to think they have a highly efficient invoice process compared to everyone else - but the truth is that pretty much every company has the same basic ideas :) (note: YMMV - we sell to specific/specialized companies in the same fields who all tend to be quite similar anyway)<p><i>""We will release the funds after you provide your US social security number.""</i><p>This has proven a problem for us in the past - some of the companies (about 30% of our sales are in the US) genuinely don't believe anyone in the UK is able to write/sell software on an enterprise level :P You'd also be surprised how many times we get asked to come out and do a demo of the software - and they can't understand that is a non-trivial trip :)<p><i>""We only pay using Bankers' Scrolls made from papyrus""</i><p>This is absolutely the biggest ball ache. Especially because they want US bank details... Paypal is, in my opinion, a complete no-go anyway once you are over about $1000 (and possibly a lot less). We've set up a merchant account and threw up a really simple payment gateway for clients. This has proven pretty popular and has yet to be refused; in fact I think once a company becomes aware that we ""handle our own payments"" they are willing to work with it. Credit Cards have proven to be perfectly acceptable even for the biggest companies.<p><i>""If someone sues us over your product, you have to pay our legal costs.""</i><p>Just outright refuse this if you can. Mostly because there is wide possibility for them to try and screw you with it if they make a mistake. If they insist I always make sure it explicitly deals with what circumstances can be considered ""our fault"" (i.e. bugs etc. rather than misconfiguration).<p>Most companies seem reasonably happy if you offer them free ""on-site"" technical support in the case that they run into difficulties which might lead to legal issues (usually through a claim-back of tech support costs after the fact).<p>(as always - your experience may differ, all companies are different)",1274716777

A parser is necessarily built in to any interpreter/compiler for language with syntax, whether that language be a lisp or an assembly language or Java.<p>The existence of a parser does not imply its availability.  As you said ""Some of them don't have the parsers available at all (e.g. C),""<p>> but some do (e.g. Python),<p>Python does make a parse tree available, but not in a very useful fashion.  You can use it to rewrite programs but not as part of ordinary programming.<p>> In any case, your claim does not hold for ""traditional languages"" in any generality, there is too much variety.<p>Actually it does because there are very few ""traditional languages"" that even approach Python's in-language support for their own AST, let alone come close to Lisp's.

1374914,comment,1374828,1374893,0,0,patio11,,,"At levels above ""webmaster welfare"" (as my SEO friends call it), you can do direct ad sales or affiliate ads.<p>A smart guy once suggested to me that when trying to sell ads on a semi-successful site he would ""give"" one of the six ad slots to an affiliate-using merchant by using their standard affiliate creative in the slot, and watch what revenue was from that.  That would both give social proof to the site (""Look!  It already sold one ad!""), and give him a floor to establish prices on the remaining inventory.  If you can make e.g. $60 a month with on affiliate ad, then charge everybody else $100 a month for the same slot.<p>Apparently, in many niches, ""Your ad in this space.  Click here."" works well enough to sell out inventory for small sites.  There are many, many options for you if you want to make it a self-service thing rather than a ""Email me, hammer out an agreement, and after you Paypal me the money I'll add your link directly in myself.""<p>[Edit: At higher levels of deviousness it occurs to me that why have one filled slot and five empty ones when you can have five filled slots and one empty ones.  This space is going, going, gone -- get it before it becomes booked!<p>Don't like affiliate ads?  Advertise your favorite OSS project.

Adsense only works (makes you more than a buck or two) with large libraries of content - popular content with high search numbers and lots of advertisers in that space. ie. Articles about dieting and debt will bring you more per click than technology.<p>The best way to make money on a small site is to go out and contact active advertisers (people advertising on sites like your own) and having a low (no-brainer) price for ads. $10-15/mo. for a small 125x125 px ad will bring you more than an adsense banner (for the majority of sites).<p>Affiliate marketing is also a great alternative.

That's alright, happens to a lot of us. Heck, given a chance, I'd jump my job and look for something cooler too.<p>The thing is, Hacker news isn't a jobs board. This is a community for startups. I'm kinda certain most of the people here aren't looking for experience, they're more interested in building stuff, and they learn/figure out how to do it by themselves. Google is your friend! Certifications and resumes are unimportant when it comes to these things. People here are more interested in the 'what have you done', rather than the 'what would you like to do', or even worse, 'how many months did you spend at company X'.<p>PS-  imho, when you do go out into the world (you're 18, so I'm assuming a bit here) of job hunting, you might want to skip using your myspace link and METAL.EVIL mail addresses.

2. I would very much like to try out using the system before having to sign up and create a name like myproject.flow.io.

That gives me the leeway to really use it with a client for a very small project, and then they would start to pay once it grows.  At 1 user, that is really only a free trial, and I would not be able to use that with a real client (since we need at least one developer to login and one customer to login).  I'm not upset that you're charging, I'm just saying it doesn't provide an in for me to start to use it with people before paying.

Most of the dominant methods used today,  such as the SVM,  boosting,  and the dynamic programming methods used in genomics are (i) numerical more than symbolic and (ii) involve moving a LOT of data around,  so you want control of your data structures.  (Sometimes these guys compress in-memory pointers!)<p>I looked long and hard at Scala and decided that I didn't like what I saw.  One problem is that,  based on the JVM,  type erasure is a big ""broken window"" that seriously damages the Scala type system.  You can use generics for ~years~ in Java and never notice the problems that type erasure causes,  but I find that 2/3 of the designs that I specifically want an advanced type system for do not work in Scala because of type erasure.<p>Another issue with Scala is that the interface with Java,  particularly using collections,  is awkward;  people who want to work in the JVM but want concision might be happier with Groovy.  Scala's Lispy-Lists are convenient for the pattern matching capabilities in Scala,  but are much less efficient than the vector-based Lists that come with Java when your data gets big.<p>As for oCaml,  the real excitement is in F#.  You get the wonderful oCaml language and all of its features,  plus you get an interface to the C#/.NET world that's much nicer than Scala's interface to the JVM.  You've got access to the whole .NET framework base class library,  plus all sorts of stuff that's been written for .NET.<p>I'd also put C# on the border between a ""mainstream"" and ""advanced"" language.  C#'s generics implementation just added support for covariant and contravariant inheritance,  which is one of the features that had me interested in Scala.  C# has good lambdas,  really neat stuff in LINQ,  and ""expression trees"" which offer metaprogramming capabilities above and beyond any static language I've seen.<p>Note that there is a good open source implementation of the .NET framework, Mono,  so you can develop in C# and F# and target Linux,  MacOS and other platforms.",1274715003

1374841,comment,1374303,1374737,0,0,aycangulez,,,"Thank you for the detailed explanation of how kanban in manufacturing works. Here is how it works in knowledge work:<p>kanban is a pull system. You pull work only when there is capacity to handle it. This works well in a factory setting because you know exactly how much capacity you have. In knowledge work, however, it is likely that you do not really know what your team is capable of because:<p>- Knowledge work is invisible and highly variable.<p>- Most of the time everyone is working on everything.<p>- There is a hidden but significant cost of task switching caused by multitasking.<p>If you want to know your team's capacity, you have to limit the number of tasks they work on at the same time. This is called a Work In Progress (WIP) limit in kanban. Once you limit WIP, several interesting things will happen:<p>- A backlog of tasks will emerge.<p>- You will be able to measure how much time is spent on each task.<p>- Tasks will get finished faster.<p>The first two results are not very surprising because by introducing WIP limits, you have effectively eliminated multitasking, but how on earth, do tasks get finished faster?<p>- Unlike computers with multiple processor cores, our brains have one or at best two cores. Without WIP limits, when there are too many tasks to work on, we spend more time on switching tasks than the tasks themselves.<p>- Bottlenecks become visible. Since everyone is working on a limited number of tasks, some finish theirs on time, some get overloaded, and some cannot finish their work because they need input from those who are overloaded.<p>- Team members with free capacity can help those who are overloaded. Better yet, they can even come up with ideas on how to fix the newly discovered bottlenecks.",1274714983

I don't care about features unless they are so disruptive and innovative that I just have to have them. Saying you have X, Y, & Z isn't really appealing to me.

To this day if I have something important to say I do my best to say it in person or on the phone.

Armchair observers opining on the internet have never felt the need to rely on data before.  They've long since drawn their conclusions and simply shop for justification; freely inventing some if acceptable evidence doesn't present itself.<p>So no-one's mind is going to be changed, regardless.<p>If you were bullish and it tanks, then Apple's 'premium' segment is assumed to have already moved to ATT.  If you were bearish and it takes off, then it's the usual ""marketing"" and ""cult"" arguments again.  The very marks of 'tank' versus 'incremental' versus 'wild success' will be subjectively twisted all to high hell.  It won't matter if Apple sells 6M or 12M.<p>Just watch the reactions when the inevitable avalanche of pre-orders and launch-day lines are reported.  ""macolyte"" and ""marketing circus"" will get bandied about again, along with suggestions that once the early movement is cleared out <i>then</i> the real measuring of Apple's success on Verizon can begin...",1294772361

Shannon Love points out the need for ""teamwork"" and suggest that it is a uniquely American strength. Open paragraphs:<p>Noticeably excluded from her children’s activities is any kind of team activities. The secret of American’s collective success as a people is our ability to self-organize ourselves on both the small and large scale into highly effective teams The relative inability to self-organize into teams is why China and some other cultures have lagged behind in the modern world. Americans have long relied on activities like sports, theater, marching band etc to teach that one critical American cultural skill. By excluding such activities from her children’s life, Chua is depriving them of one of the most crucial skills an American must have.<p>American culture is based on the seeming contradiction of extreme individualism combined with a near instant willingness and ability to join a team to accomplish any particular task. The way New Yorkers spontaneously organized to evacuate Manhatten on 9/11 represented a large scale and dramatic example of the type of self-organization that Americans reflexively engage in on a daily bases.",1294772013

Study in school, do well on your standardized tests, get into a good college, pay attention to salaries when choosing your major, show up for on-campus interviews, and do your job well when you're hired.  It's not hard to be making six figures a few years after graduation on this plan.<p>But to break the 99th percentile - I think that was $342K/year for 99.5th percentile of single filers - you need to take on some risk.  Like forgoing your income for a few years to found a company.  Or taking on a lower salary and the risk that you'll be laid off in a year and getting a job at a startup.  Or putting up your own money to invest in one.  Or taking on high-visibility, high-impact projects that may fail - often at the cost of your regular duties - within your day job.<p>For people whose whole life has been a steady upwards progression, risk is scary.  It often looks impossible.  And so they're stuck at a point in life where they know people who have vastly more money than them, but they don't understand how or are unwilling to achieve that.",1294770901

If you've fixed your code to work with the adjustment layers, you might as well fix it to work that way in general, which I think what GEGL is . It's still not the ""adjustment layers"" that are fixing anything, it's the fact that you're actually retaining the bits. Pure 8-bit adjustment layers will still look bad, and 12/14/16/8+-bit normal layers will look much better with and without adjustment layers.

2092859,comment,2092218,2092657,0,0,juiceandjuice,,,"A lot of the cases with ADHD are very specific to the type of ADHD.  Usually things that somehow alter norepinephrine or Dopamine levels in the brain (as Caffeine does) often alter somebody's response with ADHD.<p>For me, it doesn't work.  I'm just too wired, my heart feels like it's going to pop out of my chest if I take an  amount that will affect my actual concentration (not the same as alertness).  Adderall, to me, feels like a much smoother caffeine, and I can concentrate.  However, I hate the way it also makes me feel in high doses.  Atomoxetine worked great for me as well, but had weird ""sexual"" side effects.  Right now I'm mostly on Wellbutrin XL, which is a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, and while it doesn't work as well stimulants, it does work to a point and I feel like my normal self and even better.  So far, the best combination for me has been Wellbutrin with a small kicker (5-10mg) of Adderall.  Before Wellbutrin, I would take 20-60mg of Adderall a day.  Also, Wellbutrin helps with some of my natural anxiety as well.<p>Also, for what it's worth, Adderall (a stimulant) tends to decrease anxiety for me in certain situations, while amplifying it in others.  It's a weird relationship.  In some social situations where tons of things are happening, without Adderall I can't focus on anything and I start to go on a weird panic mode.  With adderall, that decreases because I can ignore certain things.  But it also decreases with alcohol too, because I just don't care.<p>Anyways, the best thing I ever did was see a psychiatrist.  Treatment of ADHD sucks because it's hard to know what will and what won't work, and what side effects are involved.<p>end tangent.",1294769450

In that case you aren't learning anything either - because then everything is just correlation.<p>When one investigates some arbitrary phenomena, it is important to constrain one's experiment and control all but one variable so that one can be sure that the changes one observes are more likely to be due to causation rather than correlation.<p>For example: Stating that Africa is a failure because of X thing is full of peril.<p>However, stating that when people don't have easy access to safe drinking water, they are more likely to die of water borne illnesses, and that this has probably contributed to the failure of Africa is a much more secure statement. It's not nearly as pithy, and it includes many qualifiers - but then again, it is a much more accurate and true assessment. It is also much less likely to be subject to vague/""woo""/dumbass business like thinking.<p><i>> These are all situational factors common to TechStars, 500 Startups, etc. but which don't explain YC's unique success.</i><p>First mover advantage anyone?

5273331,comment,5271225,5271225,1,0,c3d,,,"The article focuses on writing great code, but there's another reason to learn assembly language: for some specific aspects of a machine that were not modelled in the higher level languags, this may be the only way to go.<p>For example, for HP Integrity Virtual Machines (sort of VMware for HP big iron servers), I spent a lot of time writing low level vector code that just cannot be written in any other language because it executes in some specific restricted environment that the C compiler cannot deal with. Specifically, it runs off a few reserved registers, has no valid stack (a TLB handler may be triggererd by a TLB miss on the stack), and frequently use instructions that are at best supported by compilers as inline assembly.<p>So it's not just about performance or style, it's also about semantics. And that's part of the reason why in XL, all low-level operations are connected with the machine explicitly. I reasoned that what worked for an addition would alo work for a more bizarre machine instruction.<p>So in XL you have for the imperative dialect:<p><pre><code>    function Add(x,y:integer) return integer written x+y is XL.Bytecode.Add
</code></pre>
And for the functional dialect:<p><pre><code>    X:integer + Y:integer as integer -> opcode Add
</code></pre>
The list of opcodes is machine specific, but the way to connect to them is not.<p>Does not solve the whole problem, e.g. The compiler still has to assume things like ""there's a stack"", but getting closer to connecting machine and high level languages.",1361692264

It has to do with the perceived browsing habits of one's users.<p>Let's posit that there are two ways of information search/seeking: the directed searcher, and the explorer. The direct searcher knows what he/she wants, either a narrow search or in broad swatches. Then there is another behaviour which is the explorer. When users are in this mode, their minds explore what is possible and their eyes roam to what attracts them.<p>Understanding these two behaviours, interaction design becomes quite a simple problem to solve. In the former, the interaction design is to get the user/reader to the target object as fast as possible. In the latter behaviour, the interaction design is to get users to stick around your system for as long as possible.<p>The best interaction design I have seen and experienced for the former behaviour is Google. The whole design of Google is to get people off their page as soon as possible.<p>Ironically, the best interaction design I have seen for the latter behaviour has the most minimal of UI design. I'm talking of course, about StumbleUpon.<p>Unfortunately it is very difficult to monetize SU's interaction design (SU ultimately found a method to monetize its assets which I found rather interesting). The Pinterest UI is merely a logical conclusion of designing interaction for lingering souls and wandering minds.<p>Imagine how easy it would be to have a 300x250 image ad in one of the boxes. Of course, the surprising thing is that Pinterest does not actively use display advertising to monetize.<p>[0] <a href=""http://theforkingchef.com/post/41947940039/search-behaviour-types"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theforkingchef.com/post/41947940039/search-behaviour-...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://theforkingchef.com/post/42355830855/the-subscriber-and-the-seeker"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theforkingchef.com/post/42355830855/the-subscriber-an...</a>",1361691663

I got married not long after getting here.  I'm now, um, older...<p>It's great for folks who are fresh out of college that a bunch of middle-aged VCs who missed the boat on Zuckerberg because after the dot.com boom they were ""playing it safe"" backing their MBA buddies in startups which went nowhere, are now desperately trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted and find the next Zuckerberg by investing in very young entrepreneurs.  It's great.  There is some brilliant innovative consumer apps that have come from this - diamonds in a pile of rhinestones admittedly, but they're real.<p>When I was 22 and my best friend were 21 we were being laughed out of every funding source we could find by suggesting that (this is in 1993/4 mind you) we set up an ""Internet Service Provider"" because we were European Physicists when the world wide web was created by and for European Physicists and we thought it was going to be big.  ""What is this Internet thing?  ...It's an American fad, going nowhere... you're just two young techies with no business experience... etc.""  I am genuinely glad the environment is better today than it was then.<p>However (yeah there's a but)... it's breeding a generation of young technical talent burnt out on mediocre over-angel-funded startups with little real world life or experience.  It's not that either end of the spectrum is right - it's that we've gone too far past a happy medium.<p>I used to run an internship program and I'd advise the young undergrads that they should get out and do the things they want to do after college, take risks, travel while you can and while you're young.  So long as you have a good narrative, have learned a lot from your experiences, and take the opportunity to grow up and gain perspective on the world, people will forgive almost anything before you're thirtieth birthday so long as you're prepared to knuckle down and focus by then.<p>I don't think that's true today.  We've created an environment where to be a first time entrepreneur over thirty is seen as questionable.  By 40 even with experience if you haven't already had a home run it's VERY difficult to get financial backing right now.  This is irrational of course.  The idea that real world experience dulls your blade which would otherwise have been fresh, right out of college, is silly.<p>I am happy that I didn't spend my 20s just getting burned out.  After we couldn't get our startup off the ground, we finished our degrees, did some real world work, got some life experience, and I don't think either of us was worse for it as a person.<p>I meet a lot of people looking around in their thirties and realizing, like this article says, that they've never really learned the broad range of interpersonal skills and relationship skills outside of the startup bubble.<p>Do what you love to do for work.

You could argue that today's technology makes it TOO easy to read material and take notes on it, causing you to spend less time on the material and decreasing retention.<p>And I think this finding is key:
<i>The paper textbook helps them to avoid the distractions of being on the computer or the Internet, the temptations associated with checking e-mail, Facebook, or surfing the Web for unrelated information.</i><p>Perhaps giving out e-readers at schools used ONLY for e-textbooks would help e-textbooks catch on more.

There's a huge geographic and societal component to religion, and that seems...undemocratic? I guess it would seem more 'fair' that every individual would arrive at their worldview purely from a 'rational' standpoint devoid of influence.<p>But of course it doesn't work that way for any worldview religious or otherwise. It never could work that way. Even those of us who fancy we have an 'examined life' and are attempting to be intellectually honest come at these questions with an existing interpretive framework inherited from family and society. And I don't think this is any less true of atheism or agnosticism than religion.<p>Nevertheless we try, right? Try to be objective, try to engage questions with honesty and courage and be as reflective as we can. Both negative and positive experiences with religion influence this. What's strange is I've met a number of Chinese over the last few years who grew up under communist, atheist rule and are now disenchanted with it, and deeply curious about religion and Christianity in particular.<p>What does it mean? Not sure. What to do? Not sure there either. I seem to have faith, you don't. I don't know what that means. I see the world a certain way, I can't help it. I like exploring and articulating that worldview, I want to have as much integrity within it as I can, I know that there are certain points of view that I disagree with, but ultimately, to quote David Byrne -- how did I get here?

3016403,comment,3016085,3016085,1,0,epoxyhockey,,,"From an indie rock musician's standpoint, I could interpret the MVP of a song as many things.  A cool sounding riff, an instrumental (song w/o lyrics) or poetry (lyrics w/o instruments).<p>The quick answer is that my band performs none of those things in a concert setting.  The most MVP we perform is a song that maybe doesn't have all of the lyrics worked out or maybe needing another section of music added to it - a work in progress.  In our private practice sessions, of course, we build songs from scratch and you could make some comparisons to MVP.<p>I would compare music to hardware rather than software.  You need to have things pretty well worked out before public performance because no one comes to a show to hear you play one riff and most audiences don't care to listen to a boring set full of rock instrumentals and no lyrics.<p>Also, it is generally difficult to get real-time feedback from an audience while performing rock music.  Some audiences just stand and stare at you while bobbing their heads and other audiences jump around so long as there is a beat.  You don't have the constant feedback that a comedian has after every joke.  Pretty much the only feedback you'll get is that people will leave if you suck, or they will clap a little less after a song if they aren't as entertained.  I have to ask my close friends after the show what they think of certain songs.<p>I don't think any musician creates music for the sole purpose of pleasing the audience.

A team of researchers found that Chinese Americans die younger than expected ""if they have a combination of disease and birth year which Chinese astrology and medicine considers ill-fated."" That is to say, if they were born in a year that was astrologically linked to poor lung health, they would die an average of five years earlier from lung-related disease than someone born in some other year with the same disease. Similar effects were not found in the white populations around them. And how much sooner you died depended on the people's ""strength of commitment to traditional Chinese culture.""<p>Think about that for a minute. If you were born under a bad sign, you died five years younger from the same diseases as people born under good signs. But only if you believed in Chinese astrology""</i>",1316496631

And that's all, and I don't understand that. I'm no exemplar of intellectual integrity, but I'm just too curious to not read contrary points of view. I thought that was the point. When I first started questioning my own faith, I went after the best atheists I could find to read, which at the time were guys like Antony Flew, Quentin Smith Kai Nielson, Peter Singer. Then later some pretty deep reading of Russell and Ayer. On the existential side Sartre, Camus and finally the greatness of Nietzsche.<p>I don't find that same aggressive curiosity and charitable engagement with this generation of atheists that have latched onto the Four Horsemen, and honestly I don't find the Four Horsemen all that compelling, even at a distance. Dennett of course is the deepest intellectual of the bunch but I don't find much new there. Consciousness Explained just really, really wasn't, sorry. But that's ok -- we can debate that, I would just like to see some curious, adventurous young atheists who can read both Dawkins and someone like, say, Christopher Dawson or T.S. Eliot -- not just for the sake of debate and argument but for the understanding of the soul of a worldview that deserves at least respect and not derision.<p>Likely the same thing you're asking from me...",1316496075

I feel like it would be summarized, ""Lots of people like to loudly be ignorant about their beliefs"". I don't disagree with that, but I don't find it uniquely or even tilted towards atheism.<p>Further, I still don't understand the reductive criticism on Dawkins. Again, I find much of his positioning to be directly related or relatable to very palpable issues. Even in his books, he uses real life modern and historical examples and addresses their basis in logic and their societal effects before breaking it down and discussing it in what I might call a reductive fashion.<p>If anything, I feel like you're looking for a philosophical discussion that Dawkins, and I would suspect many Atheists, are flatly uninterested in.<p>(I find myself a little surprised to see such a discussion surrounding Santa Claus. I won't purport to know how the cited individuals would reply to such a simplistic response, but I've yet to have it sufficiently answered and though it may spark a larger discussion, it's simplistic nature is a way for me to express how little initial\fundamental stock I put in the existence of either.)<p>In closing, yes, beer and a good theological discussion sounds nice. Most of the people who were willing to sit down with me simply refer me to a higher authority now though (they tell me that they can't answer my questions and to go ask a Preist or a Preacher, I've already been Catholic once though :P).",1316495236

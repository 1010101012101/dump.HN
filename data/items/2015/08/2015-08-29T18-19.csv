10141002,comment,10139144,10139655,0,0,cmurf,,,"I disagree with the specific point that taking the blame of others is at all moral or good or proper. It isn&#x27;t even remotely the same thing as forgiveness. Either Christ was a scapegoat, an immoral transference of sin onto another to be ritualistically slaughtered; or Christ, as God (i.e. the trinity) who blamed himself for the mistake of creating man in the first place, is taking responsibility for this mistake and leaves his punishment up to the free will of humans who prove their miserableness with murder.<p>So no matter how you look at this it doesn&#x27;t make humans look particularly good let alone divine. And the very idea of original sin, which makes Christ&#x27;s existence and death necessary, is immoral. The actions of others has absolutely zero rational transference to children. It&#x27;s an allegory for why all humans are so wicked. It&#x27;s a nasty story.",1440874724

10140991,comment,10136014,10137988,0,0,Houshalter,,,"The point about negligible senescence was just to prove that aging isn&#x27;t a biological necessity. There are animals that don&#x27;t age, which means aging is neither evolutionary necessary nor undefeatable.<p>If we get to the point where we can edit genes, we could do it intelligently. Certainly better than random mutations and selection over tens of thousands of years.<p>Organ transplants are not trivial, but it&#x27;s possible we could improve surgery and anesthesia, as opposed to curing aging directly.<p>a) I did mention that this wasn&#x27;t a cure for aging, just a life extension. You&#x27;ve eliminated basically all the diseases that occur below the head and this would extend your life a ton.<p>b) It&#x27;s been shown that younger blood rejuvenates brain tissue a lot: <a href=""https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/05/infusion-of-young-blood-recharges-brains-of-old-mice-study-finds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2014/05/infusion-of-y...</a> And cancer from regenerative therapies wouldn&#x27;t be as much of an issue if you are in a younger body with a fully functioning immune system. It&#x27;s also possible we will eventually be able to tweak the parameters of the immune system to help with that cause.<p>c) You can slowly add in younger brain tissue as older stuff dies. There was a study where they replaced all of the glial cells in living mice with human glial cells, just by injecting them with stem cells: <a href=""http://www.medicaldaily.com/bringing-human-brain-mice-glial-cells-support-neurons-make-animals-smarter-312602"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medicaldaily.com/bringing-human-brain-mice-glial-...</a> But you can also add new neurons over time too as the old ones die. This isn&#x27;t as bad as it sounds. The new neurons would learn the patterns in the old neurons. Memories are highly distributed in the brain - you can cut out half of your brain and still function normally and remember everything. Most of your memories and personality would persist even as you replace your entire brain.<p>Cryopreservation is believed to preserve most of the information in the brain. The connectome is definitely preserved. Information contained within the cells is probably preserved at such cold temperatures, if it&#x27;s even necessary. In the future it&#x27;s very likely they will have the technology necessary to reconstruct a brain from this information. Reviving the brain tissue itself might even be possible because of how much is preserved, and how advanced technology might be.",1440874550

And it was something that people got wrong -- e.g. Enlightenment thinkers overstated how different and privileged humans are in this respect.<p>Take the example of optical illusions.  Even though I can tell how the illusion works, and you rationally know that two lines are the same length, and you can literally measure it yourself with a ruler -- your mind will still see them as different [1].<p>This is a benign example, but there are lots of other examples where &quot;knowing&quot; that you are wrong doesn&#x27;t prevent you from <i>acting</i> as if you held the wrong beliefs.<p>If you are an investor, you should be familiar with the concept of &quot;loss aversion&quot;, which is easily  verified with an experiment and replicated.

Most senior engineers I know who are working at one of: Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, or Twitter, earn over $200k (total compensation, counting stock grants), and many earn closer to $500k.<p>Des Moines doesn&#x27;t have major campuses of any of the above employers (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong), so the increased salary pressure from the high rolling Internet companies isn&#x27;t affecting the local market.<p>Would love it if more big companies would hire remote workers; it would &quot;spread the money&quot; around the country more evenly, they could probably find developers for less, and it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses wasted on commuting.<p>But until they do, a significant fraction of the best developers will <i>congregate</i> in the Bay Area, where they can potentially pull in $500k/year instead of a pathetic $95k.

10140929,comment,10140521,10140794,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Well in the past he ran for president, too, always on a hype-media issue like Obama&#x27;s birth certificate that wouldn&#x27;t actually give him any chance of running, yet allowed him to put his name in the media. (exposure is probably his biggest business model, the more exposure he has, the more people view him as a success, the easier he can get a TV show or license out his name for some building or golf resort he doesn&#x27;t own). So in the past he never actually did anything a normal politician would do, i.e. fundraising, or indeed divulging his financial assets when officially filing the paperwork, because he just used the presidential race as some form media platform for a few weeks, very much like say Kickstarter, for his business.<p>This time around it&#x27;s a bit different, he seems to actually be campaigning, participating in debates, filing the paperwork. But even now I still don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s serious about running. I mean the way he talks about policies is just a joke. &#x27;I&#x27;m gonna make America so great, I&#x27;m gonna make you soooo proud, you&#x27;re going to become the happiest people&#x27;, I mean it&#x27;s just laughable. Anyway my point is that he doesn&#x27;t have any real policy plans. He&#x27;s like some of the Dutch politicians we have over here that make policy promises that they can&#x27;t keep because they break Dutch, international and European laws and agreements that the Netherlands has signed. Everyone who knows anything about how the world works laughs at this, but people eat it up. So I&#x27;m still not convinced he&#x27;s actually interested to run for the office all the way, (although I&#x27;m less sure about it than ever) and if that&#x27;s true he&#x27;s not going to be serious about raising millions from big donors, so Trump&#x27;s paper trail isn&#x27;t surprising in the least. Here you can see how little he raised as of earlier this month [0] That type of money can&#x27;t sustain popularity in the real elections when people spend $300m on attacking every single thing you do from every single angle all over TV, Radio, print and the internet, which is why people are skeptical combined with Trump&#x27;s lack of policy plans, lack of solid political team who&#x27;s working on real policy plans and disingenuous campaigns in the best (I wanna be president cause Obama is from Kenya).<p>Beyond that, it&#x27;s early days. The last presidential elections all had $1b dollar budgets for both candidates of the ruling parties for example, and both parties spent about $1b each. (Obama, Romney, McCain), and both candidates had 2/3rd or more of their money coming from large donors. Lastly, it&#x27;s an interesting note to make that Obama spent 2x as much per vote than McCain in 2008, and about 40% more than Romney per vote. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be much different for anyone who wants to win this day and age, Clinton, Bush, Trump or Bernie.<p>Also if you look at fundraising, nearly half of it goes through parties rather than individuals, and those parties then put their weight behind the nominee. That fundraising isn&#x27;t covered in this article, and it&#x27;s exactly that fundraising which is most lopsided towards large contributors. So really I think it&#x27;s much too soon to make any sweeping conclusions. After all, a guy like Bernie earlier this month had raised just $15m. That&#x27;s top 6 by the way, not a small amount, but given the winner of the election is likely to spend more than $1 billion, the distribution of 1% of the early funding days probably isn&#x27;t very significant.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/election-2016-campaign-money-race.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/us/elections/electio...</a>",1440873490

This description would include all frequency bands, power levels, modulation types, or other modes of operation for which the device is designed to operate, including modes not enabled in the device as initially marketed. Also, an applicant for certification would have to specify which parties will be authorized to make software changes (e.g., the grantee, wireless service provider, other authorized parties) and the software controls that are provided to prevent unauthorized parties from enabling different modes of operation.&quot;<p>There&#x27;s no reference to specific firmware platforms like DD-WRT or OpenWRT there.<p>Is this a case of some documents describing preliminary consultations and others a final situation that differed from what was contemplated originally?<p>For that matter, is it actually the case that some routers don&#x27;t fully isolate the radio control software as intended by the regulations, in which case installing custom firmware like DD-WRT or OpenWRT really would be a risk, in which case the intent of the regulations really would be to prohibit the installation of that custom firmware in that particular context because it does present exactly the threat they are trying to control?",1440872973

10140827,comment,10139679,10140745,0,0,Silhouette,,,"I understand the ethical conflict here. I&#x27;m generally liberal in my views and tend to favour lighter regulation by default, so personally none of these issues sit easily with me. I believe technology is neutral and how it is employed is what counts, so my usual stance is that freedom should be the default and with that freedom must come responsibility. But I&#x27;m also a pragmatist.<p>You can debate the merits of useful technologies that are also dangerous. Many technologies have both negative and positive applications. Sometimes in reality those technologies are used more often for negative purposes. We then get conflicts where the same tool that can protect an individual from harm can also harm others and/or protect the individual from the consequences of their harmful actions. We also get rather different kinds of conflict where a technology can be a net benefit to society because it helps many people but that comes at a high cost a few innocent people who will lose out in some way.<p>However, when there is nothing to balance in how a technology is employed, when realistically it can <i>only</i> be used for harmful things or it causes wildly disproportionate harm, I think the ethical stance must change as well. Some things can&#x27;t be fixed afterwards, and in that case mere deterrence isn&#x27;t always enough and I do think formal regulation can be justified.",1440871641

I see no reason why why [0,inf) universes cannot have being (an interesting question is whether [0,fin] universes exist, if they do they probably don&#x27;t have conservation of energy). The mathematics that defines a universe is certainly eternal, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that only systems that work for time (-inf,inf) need have being. The logic in the article would also seem to imply that the universe cannot have initial conditions in the way we usually think about them, it can only have constants which hold everywhen which, while  certainly in line with scientific dogma, we have not sufficiently show (consider searches for variation in the fine structure constant).<p>I think the author conflates the eternal nature of the mathematics that defines a universe with the temporal nature of that universe, as if time was not itself something that was defined by the mathematics. Our own universe happens to be one of the mathematical entities that is reasonably stable and doesn&#x27;t wink back out of existence a microsecond after coming into existence or remain a sea of hot quark-gluon plasma for all eternity. Hell, there are probably universes out there without time.",1440871352

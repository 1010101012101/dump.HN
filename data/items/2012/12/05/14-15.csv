Not so much by the way it looks or works but because of the sense of superiority of their proponents. I hate that it is being touted as some kind of movement that is liberating us from the evilness of skeumorphism. It's bullshit.

We used it for writing fairly ad-hoc documentation and workflow management tools and also turning these into in-house web apps.  It also integrated very nicely with Lotus 1-2-3 and made it easy to produce custom reports as spreadsheets with nice graphs and tables.  It was surprisingly smooth and easy to work with compared to anything else at the time (and in many ways compared to most things that came after).<p>I haven't looked at Notes since 98, but I've occasionally been tempted to take a look at later version to see how a tool I really quite liked managed to turn itself into the most hated software in the industry.",1354719476

Microsoft Word, Photoshop, and advanced developer IDEs are good examples of software that should be desktop centric.  While there are text/image/code editors on mobile, the difference is that people end up <i>crafting</i> with these types of software.  They put hours into them on one project and build something they consider truly great.  Instagram makes sense on mobile because the amount of time you put into the app is likely under 10 minutes at a time.  If you're expecting your users to craft, and to spend long periods of time building something in your app then give them a big screen and a physical keyboard; give them desktop/web.<p>In addition, I think the point about not being able to rapidly fix issues is a pretty good one.

A webapp? An extension?) I'm not sure if everyone would agree, but I personally don't need the extra huge window for easy access to websites I commonly use. That never made sense to me.

So if you want to do many computations today, you will have to use a certain amount of energy today. Now lets say, you have a machine that turns any matter into energy without any loss. You put in m mass and you get out e=mc^2 energy. Problem is: You cannot get more matter into that machine today then is around you in a radius of 24 light hours.<p>So that would be a hard limit.<p>But quantum computers have proven to break that limit. One theory is that using a quantum computer means using computers in an unlimited number of parallel universes. So there is no limit to the number of calculations you can do. (See David Deutsch and his theories about parallel universes)<p>I think there are theories about the limits of what a quantum computer can calculate. But I dont know them. Would be interesting to read about it if there is something published.<p>Then again, what might look like a ""hard limit"" today will probably not do so tomorrow. Some time ago the ""lower limit on energy per calculation"" sounded like a hard limit. Then quantum computers came along and blasted through it.",1354717205

There ARE actual texts about how Go came to be, and none of it involves Google, as a corporate entity, wanting something particular and asking for some specific set of requirements, the way, say Ada was designed by the defence departments, of Erlang might have been designed by Ericsson. The story, as told also by Rob Pike elsewhere, speaks of some guys getting together t hack on a new language on some pain points THEY had, and mostly as a side project.<p>And, really, Go was never put front and center by Google, or that Google seems to care a lot about it and advertise. They've done far more for V8 and even Dart, including building a large team of full time paid compiler guys to work on those, whereas the did nothing of the sort for Go.<p>Not much adoption at Google either: some mysql load balancing service in YouTube, a caching layer for Google downloads, a Google doodle served by Go, and beta support in GAE pretty much sums it.

Give the demo by pointing out things in the actual application. Psuedo UIs or presentations aren't nearly as effective.<p>2. Allow me to use the scroll function (in both directions, like on a trackpad or magic mouse) to move around the interface. At first I thought it was broken before I realized I needed to click and drag.<p>3. When dragging a question to reorder, change it so that you are dragging the actual question, not a copy of the question. Leave a dashed border around where the question was.<p>I often find it helpful to highlight the drop-able areas as well, but this may not make sense for this use case.<p>4. Make the Settings and Delete icons on the questions more clear. Since they are hidden in the bubbles it is hard to tell what the icon actually is. Be clear first, clever second. If one of those has to go, get rid of clever. (paraphrasing Jason Fried)<p>Very nicely done. Keep iterating and you'll have a great product.",1354716035

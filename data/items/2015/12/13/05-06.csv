I wanted an account that wasn&#x27;t linked to me personally -- it was at least partially an experiment in anonymity, but it failed completely when Twitter blocked my signup until I provided a verifiable phone number.<p>Twitter denies this in the article, of course:<p>>(Twitter has denied blocking Tor. In September, Twitter spokesperson Nu Wexler told Motherboard, “Twitter does not block Tor, and many Twitter users rely on the Tor network for the important privacy and security it provides. Occasionally, signups and logins may be asked to phone verify if they exhibit spam-like behavior. This is applicable to all IPs and not just Tor IPs.”)<p>I get why they want to keep suspicious actors out of their ecosystem, but the only suspicious thing I did was try to be anonymous. If protecting people from &quot;state-sponsored attack&quot; was actually a priority, they&#x27;d figure out ways to enable people to protect themselves.",1449986246

10725533,comment,10724460,10724460,0,0,jeffmould,,,"I can somewhat relate. Although I was able to trace the cause of my novelty addiction to a particular job. I then built that into a career path for a bit (doing short term, very targeting consulting jobs. Most were subcontracts to larger projects) and oddly got tired of it and forced myself back to focusing on one thing. I do still find myself reverting back to always wanting to do new things. Usually I will devote a few hours a week just to doing something new or learning something new. Downtime between projects is used for learning as well. I make this a habit to feed my addiction to new things.<p>My first job in a R&D/Testing type role was working for an application service provider. I was responsible for evaluating new hardware from vendors before it would be released to our data centers. I had to not only test the hardware, but ensure the applications worked correctly, performance test, and document configurations. Each week was something new and I had great relationships with vendors such as Compaq, HP, Dell, and Microsoft that would constantly send demo hardware/software just so I could play. I left the job to take a position at Microsoft, and looking back regret it. I stayed at Microsoft for a little over a year for the same reason as you, I got bored. That is when I switched to just doing consulting.<p>But, if that doesn&#x27;t work, I would look for positions in R&D for a company (that is the type of position where I traced my problem back to). Depending on the company/position you actually get paid to find and work with new &quot;toys&quot;. Also, look at testing type positions.",1449985451

10725530,comment,10720485,10725169,0,0,gh02t,,,"I think it varies quite a bit from person to person. For me, the peak productivity time is 11-3 (PM). I wake up at 9:30, have breakfast and coffee while doing some casual reading and then work until 5ish with a break for lunch. On this schedule I&#x27;m usually at least as productive as the people I work with even though I&#x27;m &quot;on the clock&quot; for fewer hours. I find I tend to have extremely high productivity but I can&#x27;t maintain it for as long, so it balances out. Keeping going after I&#x27;m tired to meet an 8 hour requirement is just a waste of time and the work I do after I&#x27;m burned out is crap.<p>When I&#x27;ve tried working longer hours (by starting earlier) my total productivity <i>goes down</i> significantly. I know a lot of people who just say you get used to getting up earlier, but I never do. Even maintaining an early-ish schedule waking up at 6:30 for a full year, I was just plain miserable every day and it never got better. On the other hand, I know plenty of people who only get stuff done in the morning and rise early. Whatever works, but it sucks when jobs force everybody to start on an stupendously early schedule. But it cuts both ways - I don&#x27;t want to force other people to work on my schedule if that makes them miserable.",1449985335

10725521,comment,10724309,10724455,0,0,mbrock,,,"I&#x27;m always curious about how other people use books.<p>I&#x27;m not a scholar or a student, but I read a lot of &quot;non-fiction.&quot;  Some of it is professional, but mostly it&#x27;s because of an urge to understand the world and people.  This fascination has a limitless quality that makes it almost painful.  I feel massively ignorant, and that&#x27;s reinforced every time I find a new subject of which I am clueless.  The mass of knowledge and thought is so enormous.<p>I recently learned about von Humboldt&#x27;s late 1800s masterwork, the multi-volume &quot;Kosmos,&quot; a guide to the known world of natural science, with a 1000-paged <i>index</i>.  And now that knowledge is outdated, except that &quot;Kosmos&quot; dedicates itself to the history of science, and now that work itself is a part of that very history.  And so it goes on and on.<p>One of my Kindle reads at the moment is &quot;The Practice of Everyday Life&quot; by Miche de Certeau.  It might be disappointing to announce up front that I haven&#x27;t read much of it yet, but that itself is part of my point.  Sensing a relevant connection, I looked at the Table of Contents and found that Chapter XII is &quot;Reading as Poaching.&quot;  I turn to it and skim a few pages of stuff about French politics and find a servicable quote:<p>> <i>In the eighteenth century, the ideology of the Enlightenment claimed that the book was capable of reforming society, that educational popularization could transform manners and customs, that an elite&#x27;s products could, if they were sufficiently widespread, remodel a whole nation.  This myth of Education inscribed a theory of consumption in the structures of cultural politics.</i><p>That goes along nicely with the book&#x27;s theme of refuting an implicit &quot;productivist&quot; bias and highlighting the way &quot;users&quot; and &quot;consumers&quot; are always themselves creative, tactical, and in some sense subversive with regard to the stuff presented to them as &quot;finished products.&quot;<p>When reading the book, I sometimes feel aversion to the countercultural eagerness to demonize the systems of power, but I also don&#x27;t disagree -- it&#x27;s just a vague feeling of &quot;yes, yes, sure, get on with it...&quot;  Still, I find the author&#x27;s perspective very interesting and useful, and I&#x27;m enjoying &quot;poaching&quot; from the book.<p>A few pages later:<p>> <i>To write is to produce the text; to read is to receive it from someone else without putting one&#x27;s own mark on it, without remaking it.  In that regard, the reading of the catechism or of the Scriptures that the clergy used to recommend to girls and mothers, by forbidding these vestals of an untouchable sacred text to write continues today in the &quot;reading&quot; of the television programs offered to &quot;consumers&quot; who cannot trace their own writing on the screen where the production of the Other -- of &quot;culture&quot; -- appears.</i><p>Yes, yes...  I agree!  The vague feeling is still present, and I start to understand that it&#x27;s related to a rather uncharitable tiredness with &quot;postmodernism&quot; or &quot;poststructuralism,&quot; references to &quot;the death of the author,&quot; and so on.  I can&#x27;t identify anything specifically wrong with any of this.  There is a looming sense that if I were forced to explain to someone in this restaurant what I am reading and writing about, I might come across as some kind of flakey weirdo.  They don&#x27;t even know the other book I&#x27;m working on is about Heidegger...  But I digress.<p>I&#x27;m not interested in all this because of a moral preference for the downtrodden over the elite and powerful, though I do have some of that.  What interests me more is just simply what it is to be reading; what to actually do with books; how they function and circulate and affect people; and why they are, despite often being too long and dreary and just boring, irresistible.<p>In &quot;The Rebel Sell,&quot; another one of those books that I continue to think about and reference many years later, the authors make the provoking claim that, contrary to the self-images of most tourists, backpackers, and lovers of foreign culture, the only authentic way to travel is on business trips.  With a tangible reason to go abroad, a plausible desire for mutual exchange, instead of the usual leering and viewing and aimless wandering, the business traveller is authentically engaged and directed by a real project.<p>I would propose some other equally authentic modes.  Someone who loves to take photos is also guided on their travels by a skillful project, a context of self-actualization and learning, and so on.  Likewise someone who is researching for a story, or just someone who likes to get laid.  It strikes me that &quot;The Rebel Sell&quot; might be attacking a straw-man idea of a person who travels only to gaze, to enjoy consumptively, to &quot;appreciate.&quot;  In fact we all seem to make up projects even if only as surrogate activities.  Taking a front-lit snapshot of every single attraction one finds listed in the Lonely Planet might not be very sophisticated, but mostly we just need something, anything, to do.<p>Of course I am metaphorically equating books with places to make a point about the activities involved in reading.  A scholar researching the literature to find a good reference is on a kind of business trip.  Chapters that fail to support her argument she walks past like trinkets on a market promenade when searching for a particular kind of hat.  She doesn&#x27;t demand that the text be superbly beautiful or worthy of an appreciative gaze.  She&#x27;s not enjoying the book like you enjoy the wine on a countryside vineyard vacation; she&#x27;s critical, practical, and absorbed in an activity for the sake of a project.<p>That seems to be to be the reason why she can study large amounts of literature without becoming &quot;bored&quot; or &quot;distracted&quot; or being very concerned about &quot;attention span.&quot;  She&#x27;s working; she doesn&#x27;t get paid to merely enjoy; she might often enter states of flow even while hopping wildly from book to book, scribbling furiously, underlining, making mental connections.  She may use various tactics, including skimming, only reading a preface, or going straight to the index.  If she is studying a work of fiction to comment on its narrative structure, she might want to read it cover to cover to get the usual effect, but she might also want to obtain a gist of the plot and then engage in some other ways of reading, even ways as far removed from conventional reading as plotting word frequencies.<p>As for me, writing bloated comments on internet forums is, perhaps unfortunately, a driving force in my whole practice of reading.  I submit these ramblings because I need a question and an audience in order to write anything; otherwise I just sit and stare at the empty screen, pondering my own useless vacuity, feeling not just bored but confused in a metaphysical sense: why ever do anything, really?  What is &quot;thinking&quot;?  Who am I?  If I desire to discuss, though, that gives me real motivation, and reading too acquires a new role.<p>That all said, I remain curious about other peoples&#x27; &quot;practice of everyday life&quot; and their ways of engaging with books.  Also about how we could make books more fun.  A new kind of book club?  Come up with something, please.",1449984729

It&#x27;s likely that we won&#x27;t even notice that exact point.<p>I&#x27;m not even sure governments are interested in developing AGI. They probably want good expert systems as advisers, and effective weapons for the military. None of those require true human level intelligence. Human rulers will want to stay in control. Building something that can take this control from them is not in their interests. There likely to be an arms race between world superpowers, but it will probably be limited to multiple narrow AI projects.<p>Of course, improving narrow AI can lead to AGI, but this won&#x27;t be the goal, IMO. And it&#x27;s not a certainty. You can probably build a computer that analyses current events, and predicts future ones really well, so the President can use its help to make decisions. It does not mean that this computer will become AGI. It does not mean it will become &quot;self-aware&quot;. It does not need to have a personality to perform its intended function, so why would it develop one?<p>Finally, most people think that AGI, when it appears, will quickly become smarter than humans. This is not at all obvious, or even likely. We, humans, possess AGI, and we don&#x27;t know how to make ourselves smarter. Even if we could change our brains instantaneously, we wouldn&#x27;t know what to change! Such knowledge requires a lot of experiments, and those take time. So, sure, self-improvement is possible, but it won&#x27;t be quick.",1449983272

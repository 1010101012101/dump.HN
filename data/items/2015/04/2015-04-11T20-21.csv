Machine learning methods can produce a model which fits the data very well, and you can easily prove that it fits the data, but understanding &quot;why&quot; is much harder.<p>There is a tool called Eureqa which was specifically designed to produce understandable models, in the form of mathematical equations. A biologist used it on some data from an experiment of his, and it produced a very simple equation that fit the data perfectly.

It&#x27;s just running on a single heroku dyno, so hopefully you don&#x27;t like it that much ;)<p>Anyway - the idea came to me after listening to a Changelog episode on the burnout of Lee Hambley of Capistrano fame.  I thought that maybe it&#x27;d be nice to enable messages of thanks to be sent to contributors to projects.<p>Thing is, I&#x27;m really not sure it&#x27;s a good idea at all!  I like the idea of it not being about money, but I wonder if people will feel obligated to respond (they shouldn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s supposed to be a one-way put of happy messages!).  Also, the service works by pulling out commits, grabbing a committers email, and sending them the message... and people may hate that.  That said, all the messages will be moderated, so nothing nasty will get through.<p>I dunno, what do you think?  If you were a committer on a project and you got this message - would you think: &quot;hey, that was nice&quot;, or would you think &quot;Where the hell is this spam coming from?&quot;<p>I was thinking of shutting it down before even posting this, but I thought, what the hey, I should at least see what people think!<p>Best,

Sadly, many jobs have that initial rush of learning and then - once you know what you&#x27;re doing - it stops. That&#x27;s hard when you&#x27;re only recently out of education.<p>Others have posted links on how to meet UK startups. Perhaps there are meetups or conferences you can attend to get to know some startups, or look at the HN job postings. Startups are fun because there is more learning and challenge, things are often changing and you have to adapt to mistakes. But they have boring bits too. Being at a startup isn&#x27;t a magic bullet.<p>Can you take on more responsibility in your job and challenge yourself in new ways? Investigate new technologies to create more efficient solutions to problems you are solving (e.g. continuous deployment, analytics, dashboards, code health, new frameworks, cross-platform development, asynchronous patterns, client-side apps...).<p>Perhaps your hunger for learning is a sign you should go back into academia. I felt similarly while working in the year after I graduated, so I went back to do a Master&#x27;s. I think it was the right move for me, but it isn&#x27;t the right move for everyone.<p>If you have the finances for it, maybe it&#x27;s time to quit, travel for a bit, write, relax, and start coding for fun again. But eventually you might have to worry about money, so keep thinking one or two steps ahead.<p>Finally, another way to achieve fulfilment is to seek mastery elsewhere. Whether it&#x27;s fitness, gaming, language or other skills, you can mark time at your job while expanding your mind outside of working hours. I had an incredibly boring internship and pretty much the only way I got through it was working on math problems and studying linguistics for fun during my lunch break and evenings.<p>Good luck!",1428785843

And that is precisely what happened here.<p>> perhaps it was possible that the officer was telling the truth, and did smell marijuana?<p>Innocent until proven guilty.  Lots of things smell like marijuana.  Hot rubber tires can sometimes give off a similar odor.  Maybe it was some other car that drove by, and the officers were being prejudiced because they recognized her from a previous arrest?  We can play the &#x27;maybe&#x27; game an infinite number of ways - its up to the officers, who are using force, to justify that force.<p>>How long should an officer wait before being allowed to ask a 17 year old to step out of a car for probable cause?<p>You have a right to stay in the car until the officer determines probable cause.  The smell of marijuana is a tactic used by police to try to upset you and provoke you into doing something that might give them probably cause to arrest you.  These people had every right to stay in the car, ask if they were being detained and if they were free to go.  The police used the threat of arrest to induce conditions that allowed them to use force - and this is, unfortunately, such a common form of social engineering by the police that people have just come to accept complacency as the only possible &#x27;correct&#x27; response.<p>Stand your ground and know your rights.

And the lame reason for that deletion was that the post was too opinionated, and that it too was a one-time-action.<p>Kind of strange that of the thousands of posts BuzzFeed makes in a single week, the only two that of such egregious quality that they were completely deleted (and done so in such a way as to be removed from the Internet Archive and Google Cache) had to do with two prominent advertisers.<p>I know publishing is a business, and all journalism institutions make various compromises/cutbacks for bottom-line reasons.

A lot of comments seem to imply that any potential employer that opts to pass on your resume based on you testifying is a company that you wouldn&#x27;t want to work for. Maybe, but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s how most HR departments would be considering it.<p>Their goal is to add value to the company with each hire. They could agree with your ethics and even applaud your speaking out, but still pass on you because your past history as a whistleblower (or at least close enough to one for the term to broadly fit) makes them nervous about what you might do over a difference of opinion even if <i>they</i> believe their company to be ethical and law-abiding. Unless you happen to be a major witness in the case and the defense manages to drag you thoroughly through the mud, it&#x27;s unlikely that your CV will be tarnished enough for it to be automatically rejected as though you marked down a felony conviction on the application.<p>It&#x27;s not completely analogous, but imagine a hypothetical case where Edward Snowden is applying for a position at Google. Were you to poll Google employees, I&#x27;d expect strong support for his actions. Hell, his leaks <i>clearly</i> benefited Google by informing them what the NSA was up to and how they were tapping into their internal traffic. But would that support prevent them from worrying about what might happen if he disagreed about certain activities at Google? Snowden already demonstrated a strength of character strong enough to go against the massed might of the United States government of all entities, and for all of their marketshare, Google&#x27;s own reach pales in comparison. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d automatically disqualify Snowden, but it&#x27;s something that would probably be considered at least in part.<p>For an employer, it boils down to a simple risk analysis. What&#x27;s the likelihood that the applicant will find themselves in a similar situation again, and how does that weigh against the value that their work would add to the company? There&#x27;s really no simple answer here, let alone a guaranteed one. If you&#x27;re a strong candidate that they&#x27;d otherwise want, it&#x27;ll matter less would be the case if you had little to offer them compared to other candidates.",1428784912

Totally agree. It&#x27;s a mess not knowing where you stand, which is precisely the point. It works when we choose from who we are. There is a way to be authentic - I guess we know it without realizing it. You answered what seemed right for you, and that was being authentic. Sometimes a strong conviction is what&#x27;s needed for a decision, and that&#x27;s something being sought here. A reliable guide each of us has for our own authenticity is our own values and our own feelings. Without these invaluable guides we&#x27;re like travellers without a compass, so it works to cultivate them and deploy them much as we can. It&#x27;s a process and it gets easier.

I had the impression that eOS copies their style, here.<p>Choosing design, though, is the thing that Ubuntu really could use more of (Linux, in general, but Ubuntu seems to be the one that could potentially have resources to pull it off). I figured I could close windows with Ctrl+W: &#x27;oh, so I can close any program with Ctrl+W instead of Alt+F4?&#x27; Nope, not just any program, e.g. not GNOME Terminal or Calculator. In Ubuntu I can start programs with &#x27;Win+1&#x27; ... &#x27;Win+0&#x27; shortcuts, maximize with Ctrl+Shift+Up.

If you are worried about people able to Google you and find that you testified, there is a lot of ways to solve that problem.<p>You don&#x27;t even need to go for extensive SEO, as Search Engines may change their algorithms every now and then.<p>What you can do is, you can create a website for your professional profile where you write blog posts.

This is important because you have to  say in your own words what you want others to see about you, so as to nullify any false idea others may get on googling you.<p>The recruiter who is going to hire you will surely see the link to the website that YOU have listed and if he really cares about you, that person will read the blog posts.

There are other factors impacting compilation time. Look at Scala for example: it has a proper module system, but compilation is still relatively slow, even if better than C++. This is the reason why I&#x27;m interested in learning how Rust compiles generic functions, and what is the impact on the compilation time (because the compiler has to generate a version of the function for each possible T), the binary size, and the pressure on the CPU cache (because having many versions of the function makes harder to keep all of them in the cache at the same time).",1428782500

It's like Hellenistic polytheism in which the natural world could be understood as being comprised of human-like entities each of which can be understood the way you would psychologize a single person. You can understand the natural world as you would understand the complex interplay of visceral motivations of different human-like minds. You might find it similar to the world The Sopranos, Boardwalk Empire, Game of Thrones, any given soap opera, any Shakespeare play; the game of the viewer is you have to keep track of these different shifting alliances, relationships, and the visceral motives (lust, price, envy etc) of all these different characters plotting and scheming against each other; it's like porn for a certain part of the mind, it's just part of being a social ape.

3402410,comment,3399827,3401896,1,0,Jun8,,,"Thanks for a great reply! I think my (and I don't think I'm alone in this) bias is that when I think of intelligence I tend to think of tasks that the human brain has evolved to perform, like linguistic and visual analysis. It may be argued that these tasks form a small subspace of the ""intelligence space"", but, boy, is the human brain good at solving these! That doesn't mean that we are optimal; however, for many AI tasks the brain operates on such a vastly different performance level that comparisons with machine AI seem out of place. Even systems like Watson, which were created by many hundreds of man-years, can stump humans in narrow domain tasks.<p>Now, it might be argued that some sort of paradigm shift will occur as machines get more intelligent (e.g. similar to how results from STR and quantum theory were impossible to predict to Newtonian-constrained thinking) and some effects that we cannot predict now will prevail, like the massive increase in intelligence in humans that caused/was caused by the advent of language.",1325130093

Your UI shows way too few feed items on a page. Compared to Google Reader, for example, you display maybe 30% as much content on a single page. That makes reading RSS feeds slow on your product.<p>2. There is no ability to group RSS feeds in any way. I'm not a single interest kinda of a person, so my RSS subscriptions contain all kinds of content. I don't read all that content the same way, and I don't feel like reading some of the content all the time.<p>I like the filtering capability you have on the feeds.

I may not agree with a lot of Noam Chomsky or Ann Coulter but I have still read some of what they write.  If nothing else it sharpens my reasoning.  And it also opens horizons.

However I do think that it is bad to have assignments/quizzes that require no critical thinking and programming assignments that can be done in 30-40 minutes. There is a lot that can be taught in the area of applied machine learning.. I have to disagree that applied machine learning is inherently an ""easy"" topic.<p>I think this course would be great for what it does if they made the programming projects a bit harder and maybe labeled it an intro level course (CS129?). I totally agree with the posters sentiments -- I'd much rather have a harder class where you interact with other students to learn more complex material.",1325127621

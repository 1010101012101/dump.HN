10728343,comment,10715161,10720786,0,0,dang,,,"You&#x27;ve used a dismissive hand-wave (&quot;mood affiliation&quot;) to reduce somebody&#x27;s comment to something clearly provocative (&quot;muslims... terrorism... Trump&quot;), then alleged that the commenter must support the latter. Such a post is in effect just a delivery mechanism for the provocation, so I call it trolling. It&#x27;s like reaching out and tweaking somebody&#x27;s nose as you&#x27;re talking—it doesn&#x27;t much matter what point you happened to be arguing for at the time.<p>Your post (and you post a lot of these) takes the <i>form</i> of logically substituting one expression for an equivalent one, but that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re doing at all—you&#x27;re simply pretending to. Not even mathematical expressions can be substituted that way without careful proof that every step preserves the meaning, and natural language simply doesn&#x27;t work this way to begin with. It isn&#x27;t valid to rip something out of its context, do major surgeries on it, then fling it back with the claim that it&#x27;s what the other is really saying. When the thing you&#x27;re flinging back seems designed to be offensive, the likelihood that this is sincere communication, aiming at understanding, plummets.<p>Many of your recent comments seem crafted to be technically unimpeachable while still tweaking people&#x27;s noses. I could be wrong about that and would prefer to be; it&#x27;s hard to read intent. But the fact that they come across that way is already a problem. You&#x27;d contribute more of value if you sincerely, and not only technically, eliminated that element and sought neutral ground with others. Note that this doesn&#x27;t entail changing your views, though it can involve making an assessment of how much the conversation can tolerate before it goes haywire, and calibrating accordingly. But that&#x27;s part of civil discourse anyhow. It makes no sense to send messages with little chance of being received.",1450047555

10728316,comment,10725859,10725859,0,0,Animats,,,"This problem can be fixed.  We need to rethink file system semantics.  Here&#x27;s an approach:<p>Files are of one of the following types:<p><i>Unit files</i><p>For a unit file, the unit of consistency is the entire file.  Unit files can be created or replaced, but not modified.  Opening a unit file for writing means creating a new file. When the new file is closed successfully, the new version replaces the old version atomically.  If anything goes wrong, including a system crash, between create and successful close, including program abort, the old version remains and the new version is deleted.  File systems are required to maintain that guarantee.<p>Opens for read while updating is in progress reference the old version.  Thus, all readers always see a consistent version.<p>They&#x27;re never modified in place once written.  It&#x27;s easy for a file system to implement unit file semantics. The file system can cache or defer writes. There&#x27;s no need to journal.  The main requirement is that the close operation must block until all writes have committed to disk, then return a success status only if nothing went wrong.<p>In practice, most files are unit files.  Much effort goes into trying to get unit file semantics - &quot;.part&quot; files, elaborate file renaming rituals to try to get an atomic rename (different for each OS and file system), and such.  It would be easier to just provide unit file semantics.  That&#x27;s usually what you want.<p><i>Log files</i><p>Log files are append-only. The unit of consistency is one write.  The file system is required to guarantee that, after a program abort or crash, the file will end cleanly at the end of a write.  A &quot;fsync&quot; type operation adds the guarantee that the file is consistent to the last write.  A log file can be read while being written if opened read-only. Readers can seek, but writers cannot.  Append is always at the end of the file, even if multiple processes are writing the same file.<p>This, of course, is what you want for log files.<p><i>Temporary files</i><p>Temporary files disappear in a crash.  There&#x27;s no journaling or recovery. Random read/write access is allowed. You&#x27;re guaranteed that after a crash, they&#x27;re gone.<p><i>Managed files</i><p>Managed files are for databases and programs that care about exactly when data is committed. A &quot;write&quot; API is provided which returns a status when the write is accepted, and then makes an asynchronous callback when the write is committed and safely on disk.  This allows the database program to know which operations the file system has completed, but doesn&#x27;t impose an ordering restriction on the file system.<p>This is what a database implementor needs - solid info about if and when a write has committed. If writes have to be ordered, the database program can wait for the first write to be committed before starting the second one. If something goes wrong after a write request was submitted, the caller gets status info in the callback.<p>This would be much better than the present situation of trying to decide when a call to &quot;fsync&quot; is necessary.  It&#x27;s less restrictive in terms of synchronization - &quot;fsync&quot; waits for everything to commit, which is often more than is needed just to finish one operation.<p>This could be retrofitted to POSIX-type systems.  If you start with &quot;creat&quot; and &quot;O_CREAT&quot; you get a unit file by default, unless you specify &quot;O_APPEND&quot;, in which case you get a log file.  Files in /tmp are temporary files.  Managed files have to be created with some new flag.  Only a small number of programs use managed files, and they usually know who they are.<p>This would solve most of the problems mentioned in the original post.",1450047057

Every time someone complains about any of this, the filesystem developers come back with a bit of lore about a non-obvious combination of renameat (yes that&#x27;s a real thing) and fsync on the parent directory, or some particular flavor of fallocate, or just use AIO and manage queues yourself, or whatever depending on exactly which bogus behavior you&#x27;re trying to work around.  At best it&#x27;s an unnecessary PITA.  At worst it doesn&#x27;t even do what they claimed, so now you&#x27;ve wasted even more time.  Most often it&#x27;s just non-portable (I&#x27;m <i>so</i> sick of hearing about XFS-specific ioctls as the solution to everything) or performs abominably because of fsync entanglement or some other nonsense.<p>We have libraries to implement &quot;best practices&quot; for network I/O, portable across systems that use poll or epoll or kqueues with best performance on each etc.  What we need is the same thing for file I/O.

You should probably consider these answers a subjective interpretation, rather than objective facts.<p>The most consistent interpretation of QFT I&#x27;ve seen so far views gauge fields as principal bundles. This implies that matter not only propagate through space-time but also through the gauge field, and the way it is &#x27;changed&#x27; as it passes through the gauge field is related to the charge.<p>Now technically the electromagnetic gauge field (and others) also affects uncharged particles, mainly because it couples to gravity, but perhaps also in more subtle ways (think of the way light can be affected by simply passing through a piece of matter).<p>Admittedly there are quite a few differences (since the metric has a somewhat special position) but there are also quite a few similarities.

It&#x27;s about how you would expect and want to be treated if you were a user of the system. A company that provides you with food isn&#x27;t necessarily trying to own your eating experience. A company that provides you with physical flash cards isn&#x27;t trying to own your learning experience. It&#x27;s very clear from their business model that they are not trying to sell a product that enables and empowers people to learn better and easier, but instead are seeking to own the learning experience of the user by giving away the tools for free. These are completely different models, so comparing their model to giving away free food is an unfair representation.<p>Additionally, do not give them credit for providing a paid privacy system. Their paid privacy system is not private. The admins still have access. Other companies have shown that they are able to share and sell this information with impunity. The past has also proven that these companies have no responsibility to adequately protect this data from attackers.<p>The owner presented their product as a better Anki. Anki is a product that you download. You are the only person who has access to the flash cards you create. You own and control your own creations. This is not a better version of Anki if you are forced to give away control of your own content so that others may profit off of it.<p>The business model here is not to sell you a better wrench, but to give you a better wrench in exchange for everything you create with it.<p>I could be ok with this, if the author was just honest about it. But instead the author is adamant that they are just selling you a better wrench. So because the creators are clearly not interested in being straight forward, because they use double-talk to try to placate people and hide their true business model, fuck them.

I definitely thrashed on language selection for a few weeks before settling on Ruby. It was an opportunity to learn a great language, but I wanted to actually <i>learn</i> the language instead of relying on a huge library. Rails had a lot of overhead for what we had in mind, Rails API had only recently been merged and seemed unproven, and the more esoteric Ruby web frameworks based on Celluloid (e.g. Reel) and EventMachine (e.g. Goliath) were too daunting.<p>I think going all (well, almost all) the way down to Rack, as suggested in the OP, is a little too extreme. One of the commenters over there mentioned Rack Server Pages[3], which is interesting. Sinatra appealed to me because most of its features come disabled out of the box (in modular mode), and you can selectively reenable them and incorporate other bits of Rack middleware to build up your stack. Some commenters here appear to be conflating Rails and Sinatra in terms of behemoth-ness, which is strange to me because Sinatra::Base is less than 2,000 LOC. Sinatra is not much more than a thin DSL for creating Rack applications as described in the OP! Anyway, it also seemed silly to eschew Rails only to pull in ActiveRecord and ActiveSupport, so after another round of research I selected the excellent Sequel ORM[4] to handle database abstraction.<p>There have been times when I felt like we were going against the grain. The Ruby community is oriented around Rails, and most of my early Ruby questions received Rails-specific answers, which was frustrating. Some pieces of Rack middleware and other things like json:api serializers tend to be implemented (and documented) in a Rails-specific way; getting them to work with Sinatra (or finding viable alternatives) has been time-consuming. More than once I&#x27;ve thought to myself, &quot;If we&#x27;re going to use some unsupported and/or fringe-y thing, we might as well have built this in Elixir or Luminus or Sails or ChicagoBoss or...&quot; That being said, writing Ruby is fun, the community is great (MINASWAN), and we&#x27;ve discovered some amazing libraries. There is a ton of work going on to improve Ruby (specifically, JRuby 9K, Ruby OMR, ConcurrentRuby, etc.) so the language has a bright future. In the meantime, our solution is fast, stable, simple, and easy to test and deploy, so it meets all of our requirements.<p>1. <a href=""https://github.com/mwpastore/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/sinatra-sequel-rbx/frameworks/Ruby/sinatra-sequel/hello_world.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mwpastore/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/sinatr...</a><p>2. <a href=""https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/</a><p>3. <a href=""https://github.com/migrs/rack-server-pages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/migrs/rack-server-pages</a><p>4. <a href=""http://sequel.jeremyevans.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequel.jeremyevans.net</a>",1450044602

However, because gravity is formulated in a generally covariant (ie. invariant under diffeomorphisms) the physical predictions must nevertheless agree when formulated in a frame-independent manner, much as they must in special relativity.<p>Maybe the best example of quantum effects being different for accelerating and stationary observers is the Unruh Effect ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unruh_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unruh_effect</a> ).

Creative Cloud is a multi-app hydra that feels like it attaches to your system like a facehugger.

The reason that it matters is because an earthquake can easily cause structural damage to a building that leaves it standing but renders it uninhabitable, forcing you to demolish it anyway. Even structures that are specifically built to withstand earthquakes aren&#x27;t necessarily safe to occupy after the quake. From this (simplistic) perspective, wood is no worse than concrete because either way you&#x27;ll be forced to rebuild the vast majority of the city after the big one hits.",1450044063

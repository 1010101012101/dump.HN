I felt it might be interesting to share. If nothing else, the responses should be instructive.<p>If your value for the ocean is &quot;it must support the life of humanity&quot; then that&#x27;s fine. Just come out and say it. Of course the next step in the conversation is what, exactly, is required for the ocean to do to support life. That&#x27;s where it starts getting more tricky.<p>I think the problem here is that writers such as this are asking folks to have a religious experience -- to feel a sort of transcendence or guilt that doesn&#x27;t have to be explicitly defined or looked at too closely. Therefore anybody can read the article, feel guilt and anguish, and join in the emotional fun. Hey, who wants to nuke the ocean, kill the fish, and fill it full of garbage? Nobody, that&#x27;s who. <i>That&#x27;s</i> the troll, not my analysis of the piece.<p>It&#x27;s like humor. Once you start to really look at it, it goes away. A good sign you&#x27;re having your chain yanked.<p>I shared my opinion because articles like this only serve to gin up mobs. Take a look at some of the comments. You&#x27;ll have free marketers talking about the people that were fed, green earth types venting over the damage to mother earth, and so on. Not much in the way of actual analysis aside from just reassuring each other of our mutual shared subjective values, no matter which ones they are. Just noise.<p>I would have flagged it, but, as I said, it has artistic value. I could really feel I was there on the guy&#x27;s voyage. However your point is valid.

6580235,comment,6579760,6579760,2,0,javajosh,,,"In general, I want a little more evidence than this before declaring global catastrophe.<p>For example, I&#x27;d like to get confirmation of the problem from NOAA[1], particularly the NMFS[2]. Alternatively, Green Peace[3] would no doubt be one of the first organizations to raise an alarm - they care about the ocean, and presumably gather signals from many sources. I want confirmation because the simple fact is that it&#x27;s impossible to get a comprehensive picture of the Pacific&#x27;s health from one voyage - there are too many variables at play.<p>The skeptic in me questions the tacit assumption (the one that makes the OP&#x27;s observations so troubling) that <i>the entire Pacific is normally teaming with fish</i>. However, I assume that fish travel in schools, and that fish density is wildly variable. E.g. there are normally vast swaths of the Pacific that are &quot;dead&quot;. Indeed, anyone going out to fish for sport knows that fish aren&#x27;t uniformly distributed, and they don&#x27;t stay in one place. In the open ocean, these schools are vast, but so are the dead zones when there are no schools.<p>That said, not being in the field, I&#x27;m not sure how we gauge the health of an entire ocean from a &quot;supported biomass&quot; perspective. Nor do I know anything about who would be responsible for officially raising an alarm about global catastrophe. Or if they did, what we could do about it. It seems like the only thing we really <i>could</i> do is reduce the rate at which we harm the ocean, rather than dumping into it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospheric_Administration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Oceanic_and_Atmospher...</a>, <a href=""http://www.noaa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noaa.gov/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Marine_Fisheries_Service"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Marine_Fisheries_Serv...</a>, <a href=""http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/</a>",1382284073

say,<p>o    driving cars with tires that last only 15,000
     miles,<p>o    driving cars with engines that last only 80,000
     miles (due to poor lubrication due to water and
     gasoline in the oil due to inaccurate fuel
     mixture and ignition),<p>o    typing on typewriters with carbon paper,<p>o    doing business communications with printing
     and/or typing on paper sent by USPS,<p>o    an office telephone switchboard manned by
     employees.<p>Now enter new technology, and each of these
activities uses some automation, is much cheaper,
and puts the old employees out of work.<p>So, have lots of unemployed people with little or
no money who want to make money and consume but
cannot get jobs.<p>Why not jobs?  For one, the total number of jobs
shrank, and as in musical chairs some people don&#x27;t
get one.<p>For another, to create more jobs need some ideas for
new products/services, some capital to get the
businesses going, and some qualified employees.  The
unemployed people will need some new training, that
is, investments in &#x27;human capital&#x27;.<p>As we know from depressions, can have a shortage of
capital, lots of people not consuming who want to
work but no jobs for them to do.  Then if have a
war, suddenly can have three jobs for everyone who
can work at all.<p>There is also an effect of the ratios of people to
land and other natural resources.  With high density
population, the prices of such resources increase.
Maybe when the population of Japan, Finland, France,
Germany, Russia, the US, etc. shrink, the new ratio
will make it easier for a couple to form a family.
E.g., if the population is low enough that a young
couple can easily buy 200 acres of good farm land,
then there will be some new alternatives for that
couple to form a family.  Now at maybe $5000 an
acre, let&#x27;s, see, 200 acres would be $1 million.
She&#x27;s 18; he&#x27;s 22; and where are they going to get
$1 million or even a down payment plus farm
equipment and materials for a house?<p>Presumably in time startups will find new products
and services that people want and that can make use
of the unemployed.<p>But, in that town when automation put the typists
out of work, the jobs of some people were not
affected and, first cut, by having the company spend
much less on typing, could pay their remaining
employees more.  So, some people are doing well.<p>And in Japan, the article seems to suggest that real
estate prices are so high that no one can afford
them!  No!  Instead, real estate prices are so high
just because enough people actually can afford them.
So, some people are doing well, and maybe they, or
their lucky heirs, are forming traditional families.",1382283958

It still exists as a liquid, therefore it&#x27;s still an &quot;ocean&quot;<p>A more useful translation of the title is &quot;The ocean had a lot of artistic meaning to me in the past. A recent trip demonstrated to me that this artistic value is now gone&quot;<p>Very difficult to get clicks for, sure, but at least with the modified title I can pick it up and know what to do with it.<p>It&#x27;s a shame the author had this experience. I too like the birds and water without debris. I wonder, though: is the state of the entire ocean the same as this author indicates? Or might he be using a bit of artistic license and hyperbole to emphasize his loss?<p>I feel that he&#x27;s probably stretching things quite a bit for effect, but that&#x27;s fine. After all, the point is his emoting to us and us understanding his feelings. I was able to feel what he was feeling. Very well done.<p>The problem here, however, is trying to have some sort of public policy discussion based on what amounts to a poetic interpretation of reality. Just what is the ocean supposed to do? Look pretty? Purify our air? What job do we assign the ocean that it can then fail or succeed at? Do we owe some consideration to a large body of water that we don&#x27;t to, say, a rock? Or is the ocean&#x27;s &quot;job&quot; just to keep us alive?<p>These are subjective questions. Different people can have widely different answers to them. We make a mistake when we jump from a nicely written article about one man&#x27;s personal loss at his view of the changing state of a large body of salt water and deciding what&#x27;s right or wrong for everybody else in the world.<p>So I liked it, but with caution.

It says that 25% of young men and 45% of young women are repulsed by sexual contact. That means that 75% of men and 55% of women are still open to it (and, presumably, having it).<p>I&#x27;d bet that if you looked at an American college campus, you&#x27;d find similar behavioral statistics, due to the declining ability of young Americans to form intimate relationships (which may not be their fault). Casual sex doesn&#x27;t fit most people. Many people (including most men) can&#x27;t get it and many (including most women) don&#x27;t want it. Only about 50-60% participate in the casual market even once, and half of those end up wishing they hadn&#x27;t.<p>Still, a 35% sexlessness rate among people in their 20s means that <i>something</i> is wrong. It doesn&#x27;t mean that people have stopped having sex (65% are) but it&#x27;s still a sign of something unhealthy. I don&#x27;t take those numbers (which are probably not very different from those in the West) to indicate voluntary disinterest, but artifacts of undue stress.<p>When the cause of the sexlessness (which is not just a Japanese problem) is unnecessary corporate stress, it&#x27;s worth looking for solutions.",1382281628

Hofstede is actually a Dutchman, so interestingly enough this perspective itself could very well be a Dutch cultural trait, perhaps caused by us being among the earliest cultures who conducted world-wide trade.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede&#x27;s_cultural_dimensions_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede&#x27;s_cultural_dimensions_...</a>",1382086498

Some of the difficulties, particularly adding vs removing spoons posed significant interpretation problems for me.  Of course if I was differentiate between a few spoons and a bunch of spoons, the lines would be different if adding spoons vs subtracting them.  This is because the relative frame of reference is different.<p>It seems to me that the problem is fraught with insurmountable epistemological problems which can&#x27;t be solved and therefore people get to make best guesses.

To me that indicates that they use a public key (of which the private component does not reside on your computer, and never has, but which you can buy). The public key is used to encrypt a key for a symmetric algorithm (AES, DES, ...), which encrypts the data, and the RSA-encrypted version of that symmetric key is then prepended as a header of some sorts.<p>So using a debugger you&#x27;d be able to see the public key, which I suppose is infected-useraccount-specific.

On the other side I value my education I had in Poland only because it was hard sometimes and I was looking into how to hack the system and outsmart teachers&#x27; questions/assignments (math especially). Education system I had ten years ago was focused on memorization, &quot;soft&quot; subjects and skills (languages, first language) while math and physics weren&#x27;t valued that much.\nOn a maturity exam in 1998 we had an option (for the first time for everyone in the country), to choose between old style exam (Polish and second subject) and new style with obligatory math, much more tests and subjects, everything you could easily pass if you just know how to think. Old style was all about evaluation of how much did you remember from past 4 years... I was the only one in the whole school to choose the new form, where everyone else picked up this dumb but safe archaic form.\nI could also say a lot about technical universities in Poland.. I didn&#x27;t graduate actually, after spending over 8 years there, failing stupid, uninteresting subjects, fighting stubborn teachers. Had great scores in subjects that actually interested me. This education system forces you to learn unnecessary things, to remember results and less to know the thinking process. Angry and mentally ill teachers making you suffer for minor or no reason at all. I know plenty of fellow countrymen similar process made them stronger but saying our system is good is far fetched.",1382085335

The market of smartphones is pretty saturated. People by large who want to use smarthones compared to &quot;dumbphones&quot; most likely already use one.<p>Especially with Apple and them being first in the app store market, people who have been with them since the beginning have invested a lot on the eco system. And if you have bought so many apps and devices over the years, as time moves on, it would get more difficult to just up and leave for another eco system.<p>Which, incidentally is also why I think the design of the iPhone has not changed that much since the 4. I think starting form the first iPhone to the 4 they have really found a great design. And judging by the sales of the 4 and up, a lot of people feel the same. Personally, I don&#x27;t want the next iPhone to feature a radically different design just for the sake of change. I saw what change for the sake of change gets us with Windows8.<p>If people want to switch phones on a whim just cause there is a &quot;new sexy device&quot; coming out, then Android has been their first choice for a long time now. Most iPhone users I know chose it because a) No tinkering needed, b) Always had a smooth Interface, c) A lot of apps available and d)A nice clean phone design.<p>I don&#x27;t think Apple runs a risk just cause they don&#x27;t suddenly convert their entire approach to mimick Android companies and releasing a plethora of different phone designs and specs. iPhone is iPhone and the variety we have now is sufficient. It would have to happen a lot before I would consider a switch of eco systems. But that would be more on the side of &quot;what apple might do that I don&#x27;t like&quot; and not on the &quot;what other android companies do that I might like&quot;. So, the &quot;competition&quot; increasing, to me, is only of interest for people who just now are in the market for their first smartphone. Or people who exclusively only get free apps. For those, the choice of eco system is entirely free to change on a whim. For me who has invested several hundred dollars in apps over the years? Not so much.",1382084197

The kids were allowed to do whatever they wanted all day.  About the only thing I learned is how to forge the signature of my assistant teacher.

For kids of below-school-age this is the place where most learning takes place.<p>The question is whether learning is something that is to be compartmentalized off into school work, or whether it is something we weave into every aspect of life.  If the former, one will never become very smart or very skilled.  If the latter, then all school offers is an opportunity to learn, something that kids take advantage of based on habits acquired at home.",1382083625

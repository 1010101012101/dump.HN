The IRS has very strict rules as to who may be compensated as an employee versus an independent contractor or consultant.  This is the case, partly, no doubt, to ensure that employees are classified as such and the appropriate payroll taxes are shared between the employee and the employer.  As I understand it, officers of C corps are essentially employees and may not be compensated as consultants for services they render to a corporation.  Assigning rights in IP and stock purchase agreements are independent of the issue of whether or the someone working for the company may be considered by the IRS as an employee or an independent contractor.",1247042958

693555,comment,693293,693293,0,0,Micand,,,"If ARM and x86 are targeted, this means no Flash (not surprising, given how poorly it runs on Linux), which presumably means YouTube will be operating in full-on HTML 5 video mode by the time these devices launch.<p>If netbooks continue their meteoric ascent, and if Chrome OS grabs a significant share of the market, we may finally see the realization of the mythical Year of Linux On the Desktop. The ironic aspect, of course, is that even though a large number of non-technical users will finally be running on a fully open-source platform, they will use it to run applications whose workings are even more opaque than traditional closed-source, client-side apps.<p>I wonder what role, if any, Native Client will play on these devices. I understand Native Client to target only x86, but I find it difficult to imagine Chrome OS -- Google's first direct challenge to Windows -- not being able to run Native Client applications.",1247042781

Yes, it is dated, but until unibody MBP13 introduction Apple didn't have any other model to replace it. Well, they still don't have anything able to replace it. MBP13 has shiny display, non-replaceable battery etc. Combined with unavailability of next OSX release for PPC, I had to choose what's next. So I got an Thinkpad, that has proper display instead of mirror, easily replaceable batteries and few other perks (you can put a second battery into DVD-RW bay, and it has built-in WWAN card with great antena, oh and the keyboard rules, yay!).<p>Regarding Unix-yness, you can run Linux of your choice either natively or in vmware (I run mine in vmware), and I'm satisfied. I don't care for iLife (I used just iTunes anyway; winamp is OK replacement) or iWork. Things that I do care for are equally well done on Windows and OSX.",1247042670

693550,comment,691640,692768,0,0,paulsb,,,"I have decided to do a masters degree in computational biology (bioinformatics).<p>There are a few masters courses that could lead you to a career in data science, but it depends on your background. Most of the courses I found were specialisations, e.g. a masters in computer vision or HCI for those with a computer science background, or a masters in digital media or design and technology for those with an arts background. I had neither, so I thought I might have to do a conversion course into computer science or art and then specialise. However, when I read the article above, I realised I was more on the design side anyway (happier in Photoshop and Illustrator than a text editor) and that I needed to learn the computing and statistics side. This brought me to bioinformatics since I already have a background in biochemistry. The course will teach me programming, data mining and statistics. I also get to do three projects, which I am going to do in visualisation of life science data - which is why I got interested in this topic in the first place.<p>I think undergraduates have a greater opportunity to 'cobble' a course together tailored towards data science.<p>I found it useful to do a bit of research on anyone who does a visualisation that you like and see what their background is.",1247042257

693548,comment,693293,693293,0,0,koepked,,,"I'm not sure if I like implications of a web-centric OS, especially when its producer is as rich and powerful as Google. I see the market for it, and I think it will be a huge benefit for the average user. However, I see the transition from desktop-based software to web-based as a loss of user control. Today, when governments decide that mp3 sharing, porn, articles of political dissent, or news from non-national sources should be eliminated, they quickly realize, if they don’t already know, that elimination is impossible, because no agency can track down and deal with every user who has decided to install software allowing him/her to do these things. When software moves to the web, I think it will likely end up existing on the servers of one of an oligopoly of computing providers, who will be much easier to influence because of their small number, and because they will have no choice but to abide by legislation if they wish to remain in business.<p>This may not seem like an issue right now, because there is still choice. But with Google pushing a web-centric OS, I think within a decade, many people will have a hard time choosing something else, much the same way they had a hard time choosing something other than windows until the last five years.<p>Maybe I’m just a Big Brother fearing nut, but I don’t like where we’re heading.",1247042167

Military expenditure in the USA is so notoriously, farcically expensive and inefficient it is often quite literally a joke. China sure manages to build a lot of ships and submarines for the little money they supposedly spend.<p><i>""Even at current torrid rates of growth, it will take the average Asian 77 years to reach the income of the average American. The Chinese need 47 years. ""</i><p>I don't know what numbers this guy is looking at, but in the last two decades China has grown 7+% above whatever the US has managed to achieve. PPP is what counts in this case, so that's a 6-fold gap to catch up with the average American. A seven percent advantage will cover that in under 30 years, not 47, which is comparable to experience in Japan, Korea, and elsewhere.<p>I could go on and on, but why bother when the article seems to be founded upon such basic flaws?",1247042165

Also, this may eventually change the burden of proof in various forms of assault as the presence of sperm doesn't actually indicate that the individual involved was there.<p>On the flip side the upside is amazing, allowing sterile fathers to have children.

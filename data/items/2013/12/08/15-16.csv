No, I did not.  I just said it was better than most other power structures in America.  Why?  Because code talks.  Just because most engineers dislike political correctness and aren&#x27;t doing anything to right structural inequities permeating our society doesn&#x27;t mean they are racist.  If they are passively supporting racist structures just by being white and operating within them, okay, that&#x27;s a minor strike against them and feel free to slather on the white guilt, but it <i>pales</i> in comparison to the typical old boys club operations of most power structures in America.<p>Obviously open source has cliques and insiders as well, but that&#x27;s based on a history of actual work and participation.

Ask people at Microsoft and Google if they were servicing these FISA requests from the govt and I bet very few had any knowledge about it until the stories broke.

6869991,comment,6869483,6869789,1,0,bradleyland,,,"The whole &quot;money has value because people believe in it&quot; thing isn&#x27;t exactly correct. Money has value because somewhere along the line, someone accepted US dollars for something valueable to them. If you&#x27;re hungry, you value food. When you produce food and allow someone to pay you in US dollars, you&#x27;ve injected value in to the US dollar. The dollars you hold are an abstract representation of the value you provided that you can then exchange for something else of value in the future. The US dollar is a means of accounting.<p>The term &quot;has value&quot; is used loosely when it comes to currency. It&#x27;s true that the currency itself is valueless outside the context of trade, but most modern economic theory is predicated on the axiom that this is OK.<p>Think of it in math terms. Arabic numerals are a means of specifying quantity.<p>* * * * *<p>How many asterisks are there? There are 5. The numeral 5 describes the quantity. The number 5 is not literally five asterisks. It only describes the quantity. The same is true of modern currency. $3.50 is not literally a gallon of milk, it merely represents the economic quantity of milk. If I agree to sell you milk for dollars, I&#x27;m adding value to the dollar.<p>When viewed in this way, something else becomes clear. One of the basic values of currency is trust, not &quot;intrinsic value&quot; (which is a euphemism for intrinsic utility). When I add value to the dollar by exchaning valuable goods or services for dollars, I trust that everyone will play by the rules. Specifically, I&#x27;m trusting that the value of my trade will be preserved over the term that I hold the dollars.",1386517937

Thanks for your input, but I&#x27;d like to clarify some points.<p>The blog post&#x27;s intent was not to show how to implement your own middleware mechanism in a web framework you&#x27;re writing, but how to create HTTP middleware using the standard Go net/http interface.<p>Your proposed middleware type might feel a bit nicer, but it disregards the standard net/http interface and makes your middleware incompatible with it. Well, you <i>could</i> in theory make it compatible, but you would need some more &quot;glue&quot; and hacks. net/http doesn&#x27;t really work the way you&#x27;re proposing (returning a Response object, etc.). Please see my other post on the standard Go HTTP tools: <a href=\"http://justinas.org/embrace-gos-http-tools/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://justinas.org/embrace-gos-http-tools/</a><p>If you don&#x27;t want full compatibility with existing net/http libraries, then sure – there are nicer ways. Again, my intention was to show how to do it with net/http and I agree that there are certain trade-offs.<p>&quot;(note, I&#x27;d make the middlewares nesteable, passing a next middleware to each middleware, but that wasn&#x27;t covered in the article).&quot;<p>It <i>was</i> covered to some extent. In a model where every middleware is http.Handler itself, you nest your middlewares like:<p><pre><code>  finalHandler := Middleware1(Middleware2(MyApp))\n</code></pre>\nSo every middleware does actually get a reference to the next handler that should run.",1386517783

6869973,comment,6869483,6869708,1,0,CmdrKrool,,,"Yeah, that statement suffers from an unquestioned assumption that dollars are the definitive, correct measure of value. It takes two to make a currency pair and if you were to look through the lens the other way it would seem like the dollar that is wildly swinging about in value, not gold.<p>I like the word &#x27;value&#x27; as a signifier of what a person or people desire and ascribe worth to; both gold and fiat currencies attempt to measure this, and neither is perfect. I wish people would be more dilligent at keeping these concepts seperate, but y&#x27;know, rhetoric.<p>(See also the idea that GDP - which of course exists completely in fiat currency terms as a gross numerical figure - has its flaws as a measure of what humans actually value: <a href=\"http://www.globalexchange.org/resources/econ101/gdp\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.globalexchange.org/resources/econ101/gdp</a> )",1386517555

Internal rot will force an organization to adapt faster than any external pressure ever will. NSA workers, current and future, as well as decision-makers need to be forced into a position of deciding whether this surveillance is right for this country.

6869890,comment,6869033,6869033,13,0,networked,,,"I like the concept of a procedural space exploration game and No Man’s Sky looks like a promising entry in the genre. There has been a number of attempts so far that approached this concept from different angles (from using space as a setting for fast roguelike gameplay [1] to pure exploration [2]), many of them resulting in good games.<p>That said, if No Man’s Sky really is totally procedural I wonder how the developers will handle the overall structure of the game and avoid the &quot;quicksand box&quot; [3] trap. This is  especially pertinent if the game doesn&#x27;t feature a  Minecraft-style combination of building and survival to make the players not mind the &quot;quicksand&quot;.<p>I know the game in which I enjoyed exploring space the most is The Ur-Quan Masters (formerly known as &quot;Star Control II&quot;) [4]. The star systems and planets there are not procedurally generated and I don&#x27;t think randomizing them would make much of the difference for the reason I&#x27;ll explain in a moment. My best guess as to why I liked UQM/SC2 so much beyond its audiovisual style is that a) it has no formal mission structure that limits the player&#x27;s actions; and b) there&#x27;s a lot you can do; but c) your exploration still ties into an engaging larger story, which and in turn contributes unique one-time encounters to the exploration. A consequence of c) is that mixing up the layout of the galaxies without changing the overall plot, which at its core is fairly linear and features a time limit (think the original Fallout), wouldn&#x27;t really change what the game is like.  My guess is that the company that figures out how to generate distinct game plots that provide c) along with a) and b) will take over the procedural games business, if not the game industry as a whole. The question is whether c) can be done well enough in some way that doesn&#x27;t involve an artificial general intelligence or per-player MTurk writers.<p>[1] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Adventures_in_Infinite_Space\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Adventures_in_Infinite...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noctis</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/QuicksandBox</a><p>[4] It&#x27;s now FOSS and available from <a href=\"http://sc2.sourceforge.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sc2.sourceforge.net/</a>.

There are also certainly low paying jobs that are extremely stressful -- state level politics, social workers, etc., are likely to fall within those demographics.<p>Just as certainly though, there do exist high-stress jobs that also are high pay, and that said high stress is a check mark in the con column against it, just as &#x27;physical labor is hard&#x27; is a valid check mark in the con column against trade labor.",1386515510

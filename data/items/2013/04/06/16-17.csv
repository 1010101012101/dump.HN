If you don't, you can return it if when DELL fixes your notebook. Also, there are 12 Apple Stores in Italy.

Just surround the code block with a gc.disable()/gc.enable() or similar.<p>> AFAIK, one of the main reason people come up with custom allocators is that the system new/delete (malloc/free) are expensive to call. E.g. it is much faster to pseudo-allocate memory from system pre-allocated static memory, in your app.<p>Which funny enough is slower than in languages with automatic memory management, because the memory runtime just do a pointer increment when allocating.",1365267362

It's annoying, it may even be a showstopper. Maybe you can find another one that does the same thing, maybe better, maybe not.

These are there for a reason: they're the Rust versions of the smart pointers `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` in C++. Unlike in C++, you have to use them: there is no other way to allocate memory. So `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` would be all over the codebase in Rust code if we didn't abbreviate them, and making them one character was the easiest way to do that.<p>I actually think that one of the reasons few people write exception-safe code in C++ is that `shared_ptr` and `unique_ptr` (especially if you don't use `using namespace std;`) are so long that `new` and `delete` end up being more convenient",1365266085

5503964,comment,5503354,5503354,26,0,lifeisstillgood,,,"I think this is a really revealing story. Not revealing as \nin what the French Government were worried about specifically but as in the changing of the world.<p>Firstly the grey world of interesting classified information - it has long been the domain of Janes' Ships and similar publications - who themselves had been ""trusted"" not to go too far, and only occassionally (as in the reveal of the Stealth bomber as an airfix kit in the late '80s) does it come to mass public attention.<p>This resulted in a grey world where secrets were not actually secret - just private.<p>Secondly - the loss of privacy.  We worry about it for individuals - but it is happening to governments too, and faster.  And they, like us, have not accpeted the new reality - there is <i>no</i> privacy.  Facebook can determine if you are having an affair, are gay or ill. Combined tracking of sites and queries can reveal almost anything about ourselves and our medical conditions.  Concerned your employer might know you are rethinking your sexuality?  Don't Google ""gay bars"".  Don't friend anyone. Remove the battery from the iPhone before going out for the night.<p>The same goes for governments - if it is not a secret, it is \nopen.  And it is not a secret because you say so - its a secret because no-one knows.<p>Thirdly this leads to a simple choice - decide on the things you are going to keep secret.  And keep them secret with all the resources of the State.  This clearly does not work in the ""I say that is secret and you will now forget it"" approach taken here.  It works in the not F$%king telling anyone sense.<p>Fourthly - Most things will be open - its not feasible to hide a 100ft tower in the middle of the French countryside.\nYou cannot keep a plane secret. You cannot keep a prison secret. In fact there is not much in an open andinquisitive society you <i>can</i> keep secret.<p>What does this leave? I am not too sure.  Secret rendition flights are monitored by plane-spotting enthusiasts and soon will just be a google-satellite search away.<p>I think it will be a better world - less secrecy usually means better function, but there is a really big threat - the tempting way to keep things secret is to keep <i>everything</i> secret.  Shut down the open, democratic society.  Shut down <i>inquisitiveness</i>. Piece by piece.<p>And we do need to fight that at each and every turn because until governments get it - this is their default, tempting solution.  Fighting terrorists? Lets torture some.  Nuclear strike warning network under threat? Put wikipedia under French control.<p>My only suggestion is as follows: define National Security.  Something like a reasonable belief that this things will threaten to destroy 2% of GDP or 1000+ deaths of citizens.\nEmbarrassment to Politicans? Loss of a couple of agents? Not likely.  So when someone quotes National Security, people listen.  And if you quote it for a wikipedia article - woe betide you.<p>If we do it right we shall slowly find that like online security, you get it right by actually being secure.<p>Lesson  here - security by secrecy, is no security at all.",1365264285

2478552,comment,2476605,2477055,2,0,mike_esspe,,,"I don't see another way to bootstrap a new currency. BTW 
currently the whole bitcoin economy is 1/30 the size of e-gold reserves in 2007. So to be at least like e-gold it has to rise 30 times current price.<p>If people hold the currency to get twice next week, than this logic apply to dollars too. Why spend dollars today, if you can convert them to bitcoins and spend twice the amount next week? Either this logic works both for bitcoins and dollars, or don't work at all.<p>You can hedge BTC value on exchange instantly via exchanges API, i think i explained that in the previous post. That is the reason we need a high volume exchanges (currently mtgox have around $10000-$50000 volume per day). Merchants do it automatically, not by hand. I think we'll see a bitcoin billing soon, that will help to do this without programming knowledge.<p>Of course there are a lot of difficulties now, but how will you explain, that amount of traders is rising despite all this difficulties? Compare this page <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Trade</a> from the February and now.",1303635993

The middle ground, a 2 hour train ride, is not really that compelling, and a ticket would probably cost as much as flying. (The first time I took the Shinkansen, I had a little sticker shock. $200 to ride a train!?)</i><p>I find that hard to agree with.  City center to city center in two hours, in spacious comfort with the ability to do things while I'm travelling (e.g. easily get a laptop out and work as normal, or even just read papers), is a <i>lot</i> more of an attractive proposition to me than five (Five! That's almost a whole working day!) driving or half an hour of cramped flying, with all the airport nonsense surrounding it.  It's not for you?<p>The one place I'd agree a little is on the price - but that's just speculation, and for a lot of people (maybe most of the target marked, depending on expectations), a price compatible to flying is low enough to attract them anyway.",1303635750

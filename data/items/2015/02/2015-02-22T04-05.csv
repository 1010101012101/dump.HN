9088238,comment,9087078,9087408,0,0,chroma,,,"Your general point about the slide recoil is correct, but your comparison isn&#x27;t. Kinetic energy is proportional to the <i>square</i> of velocity. k = 1/2 * mv^2<p>In your example, the projectile has...<p><pre><code>    1/2 * 20g * (365 m/s)^2 = 1330 joules
</code></pre>
...of kinetic energy. But your slide has...<p><pre><code>    1/2 * 600g * (12.2 m/s)^2 = 44 joules
</code></pre>
...of kinetic energy. Solve for the slide velocity...<p><pre><code>    1/2 * 0.600kg * (x m/s)^2 = 1330 joules
          0.300kg * (x m/s)^2 = 1330 joules
                    (x m/s)^2 = 4433 m^2/s^2
                            x = 66.58 m/s
</code></pre>
So the slide is initially traveling backwards at around 65 meters per second. Probably faster, since only a fraction of the deflagration is transferred to the bullet.<p>Another nitpick: I think your example is not representative. A 20 gram bullet and 600 gram slide are both very heavy for a handgun. Using typical numbers: Hydra-shok 9mm +P has a bullet weighing 8 grams, which exits the muzzle at 350 meters per second. That gives 490 joules of kinetic energy. I weighed the slide on my Sig Sauer P239 at 300 grams. Plug those numbers in, and you get a slide traveling backwards at 57 meters per second. Not too different, but worth mentioning.<p>That said, I completely agree with everything else in your comment. Thank you for explaining the intricacies of handgun and ammunition metallurgy.",1424579479

Glutamate is a fundamental building block of life. If you&#x27;ve ever tasted yeast extract, you will immediately notice that it&#x27;s very salty. The only reason to eat it is as a flavor enhancer, because as a major constituent it&#x27;s too salty-- except for various Commonwealth countries that like to put it on toast.<p>Etc...<p>Shit, I bet the egg yolks in my cake batter are Bad because they substitute for cholesterol, an emulsifier and flavor enhancer which is linked to diseases (it also tastes nasty on its own)<p>Crappy food optimized for convenience, scale and profit is a huge problem.

Over 90% of them have an affiliation tracker id of /101 , although coming from different HN accounts. The questions include &quot;Does condition 8115 mean you can&#x27;t check your work email while travelling?&quot; and &quot;Can travel agents match automated ITA Travel Matrix prices?&quot;. These are only slightly less off topic than a carpet cleaning service advertisement.<p>For a while it seemed like I was seeing those links every day, to the point of annoyance. Just reading the travel-related title often meant that I knew that the topic would be uninteresting, and with the /101 at the end of the URL. My interpretation was that the operator of the account was more interested in the reputation gain on stackexchange rather than posting interesting links, and would switch accounts in order to get around HN flags.<p>There was another account a few years back which linked to an inane math trivia blog, perhaps several times per day.

The pins in that connector are basically little springy metal tabs that grab the contacts on the cartridge when you plug the cartridge in. But through use, some of those pins get loose enough so that they just <i>barely</i> make contact, and even start to fail to make contact. When you blow on a cartridge, you&#x27;re introducing enough saliva to create a conductive path and maybe get good contact at that 72 pin connector.<p>The connector is easily removed and the pins can be cleaned and bent back into place with a small flathead screwdriver. Replacement 72 pin connectors are also easily obtained on eBay and other sites.

If you let Docker run apps as root, which seems to be not uncommon, then it <i>is</i>, in a strong sense, the same as the root user outside the container. That&#x27;s why Jessie&#x27;s gparted process can partition her disk: as long as it can get at the device node, it has full permissions on it.<p>Apart from things that you&#x27;ve explicitly given it access to (like device nodes), the risk of zero-days is higher because these sorts of things aren&#x27;t quite zero-days: it&#x27;s not fundamentally a violation of the kernel&#x27;s security model for uid 0 to be able to do root-y things. You might want it to be unable to, and you might mostly succeed by not exposing certain device nodes, using a process namespace (CLONE_NEWPID) so it can&#x27;t attach itself as a debugger to other things on the  system, etc. etc. But there&#x27;s no intent in the kernel to make this safe. It&#x27;s mostly an emergent feature of other things, and emergent features make bad security features.<p>What you can do is run as not root, which still makes you the same as some other UID on the system, but guarantees that you&#x27;re not risking <i>increasing</i> privileges. User namespaces give you a few additional features here: first, even the process of entering a chroot / container doesn&#x27;t require root or a setuid binary, which is neat. Second, even if you&#x27;re root inside the container, you&#x27;re <i>not</i> root on the host system in the same sense, and it&#x27;s just kernel code that&#x27;s checking for uid == 0 (which should almost all be gone, since they changed the uid_t type in userns-enabled kernels) that thinks you&#x27;re root.<p>SELinux might be able to help you here, and I&#x27;m not really familiar with what the standard recommendations for SELinux and Docker are. I&#x27;d basically consider applying it as if the container didn&#x27;t exist: if you&#x27;re comfortable with something running as root with SELinux confinement, then it&#x27;s definitely fine to run as root inside Docker with SELinux confinement. If not, I wouldn&#x27;t risk it.<p>For server containment, you should take a look at <a href=""https://sandstorm.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sandstorm.io/</a> , which uses user namespaces <i>and</i> runs apps as uid 1000 inside the namespace. This means that it&#x27;s running with no more privilege than the host user in the worst case.",1424577721

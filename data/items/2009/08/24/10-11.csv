In the UK, the NHS provides excellent healthcare for everything except dentistry, which is noticeably poorer in both availability and (arguably) quality.<p>As far as I can see, dentistry has seen very little innovation since the invention of pneumatic drills and amalgam filling by the Victorians over a century ago - 'modern' dentistry is basically just an electrified version of that. The only other noticeable improvements, except fluoride toothpaste, are slightly updated versions of those same basic technologies, or have just been borrowed directly from general medicine, where all the research and innovation seems to take place.<p>Given that, even on subsidized NHS rates, dentistry is expensive (and massively so without) - why is this?",1251111479

781877,comment,781462,781812,0,0,davidw,,,"Sounds (but is not clear) like maybe you were trying to get 'regular' care rather than emergency care, and that the receptionist didn't bother trying to check whether the latter might indeed have been needed, and you thought ""well, I guess I can wait..."" or something like that.  That sort of thing can happen anywhere, I think.<p>Or are the Japanese so organized that they make appointments for emergency care?:-)<p>Medical care is not <i>bad</i> here in Italy, but has some drawbacks compared to the US.  On the other hand, you really have ""peace of mind"" in the sense of not having to worry about it <i>at all</i>.  You go to the doctor and you get fixed up, end of story.  Austria's system seemed a bit more complex (mostly because I never learned the language very well, I suppose), but better than Italy's.  I think it's a German/Swiss style system with non-profit insurers that everyone has to have, which seems to be a bit roundabout, but apparently works well.<p>Padova is a bit of a special case, because there's a big medical University, so there are actually some very good doctors in certain fields, it's just the ""extras"" aren't nearly as good in the US: more people per room, shoddier looking stuff.<p>And a final note: I walked into our local doctor's office this morning because of a bad cough, and the guy didn't have time to see me because I got there near the end of his office hours, but I think that's less of a system thing than this guy being a dick (my wife didn't like him either), so we'll change doctors if the local Death Panel lets us.  In reality, we don't have to ask anyone, we can just switch.",1251111009

Not because its a bucket, but because its <i>where</i> the box was. I have no evidence for this, but isn't it natural of us humans to take spatial account of our surroundings.

781870,comment,781751,781751,0,0,Maro,,,"Until recently, when I bought used books from Alibris, I payed with Google Checkout. Then I found something peculiar, it appeared as if Google charged my CC twice per transaction ('). I went to my Google account, searched around, and found no way to contact Google and ask them what's up. I immediately remembered the stories about people having their accounts killed and not being able to contact Google and get a meaningful answer, because it is their policy not to waste resources on customer support. Google even went to court to defend its practice.<p>Anyway, I now avoid Google Checkout whenever possible as it's too much of a black box.<p>(') Alibris customer support told me they aren't actually charging twice the money, the first is a ""virtual transaction"" that makes sure I have the appropriate funds.",1251110591

I think it's dismissed more because the majority of marketing campaigns send out a dishonest message, and because of that customers are getting more and more insensitive to such campaigns.<p>And I also don't think it is an engineering process in the traditional way (although it's fashionable for everything that has a feedback loop to be called engineering these days). Marketing is more about social interactions, being more inline with humanities / social sciences ... and it takes a certain kind of skill-set to be good at it, and I've seen too few technical people being good at it.",1251110267

Adam cannot understand what the purpose of his existence is if mankind's future is so bleak. The last line is spoken by God: ""Mondottam, ember, küzdj és bízva bízzál!"" (""I have told you, Man: fight on, and trust!"") Depending on the interpretation, this can either be seen cynically as the words of a capricious deity, or else pointing to a ""hope beyond all hope,"" that God has a purpose for all things which man may not necessarily comprehend. This is markedly different from Paradise Lost, where the Christian hope is explicitly spelled out.<p></i> listen to the talk: <a href=""http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2009/2641555.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.abc.net.au/rn/latenightlive/stories/2009/2641555....</a>",1251110200

781852,comment,781462,781462,0,0,abalashov,,,"Nevertheless, the formulation that insurer profits account for the difference is simplistic and, in itself, woefully inadequate.<p>Health insurance isn't a business with <i>such</i> fat margins as to account for a difference between a $1500 MRI and a $98 MRI, say.  That's the kind of rate the doctor charges the insurer, which in turn passes it on in a derivative way.  The insurer is the customer.<p>Now, why doesn't an MRI cost something batshit insane like $1500 in other countries where the practitioners are also private?  That's an interesting question.  I don't think the cost controlling abilities of government committees or agencies account for the whole story;  historically, committees of any kind - in the public or private sector - are pretty bad at keeping a lid on costs.<p>Still, I'd point the finger much more at doctors' profits than insurers' profits, though obviously neither is irrelevant.<p>I think this rather famous article treats of the matter fairly well:<p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_gawande"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/01/090601fa_fact_...</a>",1251108872

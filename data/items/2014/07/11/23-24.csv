8023156,comment,8022177,8022177,1,0,tzs,,,"> I had a really brief relationship with this girl in college; her dorm room was next to mine, and after a few evenings staying up talking all night, we made out. We spent a few nights in each others’ rooms, but we never had sex and neither of us pressured the other into doing anything we weren’t comfortable with. After a few nights, I broke things off in the cowardly way that 19-year-old guys do, and I just stopped returning her calls and texts.<p>I&#x27;m a bit confused by this part. I thought that the ignore calls and texts method of breakup only worked when those were essentially the only forms of communication you had with the person when not on a date. That method then works because with no more communication, they can no longer arrange dates.<p>How do you make that method work when the other person is in the next room?",1405123158

Right?<p>I mean, I get that it is kind of nice to be able to verify that multiple sets of folks can build the same thing and compare results.  I&#x27;m curious if there are any theoretical thoughts on how much this helps.  For instance, it does not guarantee that there are not malicious changes in the codebase.  Which is far more likely to be a problem, I would think.<p>To that end, the entire browser war is ultimately counter security.  As the vendors add more and more features, there are more and more places for malicious changes to hide.  Not just in &quot;mistakes,&quot; but in features that could be potentially misused.

I&#x27;m aware the parent comment wants to try to ignore reality and pretend you can nuke the publicly posted information on the internet in the event of a fascist government.<p>That isn&#x27;t how the internet or public communication works. The Nazis were able to identify the people they sent to concentration camps because of past associations, even once it became clear what they were doing because people don&#x27;t live in a vacuum.<p>By the same token, you aren&#x27;t going to be able to nuke all your facebook posts, twitter posts, etc. that might obviously flag you as gay &quot;magically&quot; whenever a fascist type government comes to power. The evidence is already there and completely out of your control.<p>If bad people come to power you are <i>screwed</i> regardless of what the NSA is currently doing. At worst, this shaves a few months off the process.<p>The most hilarious part of this is, all of you arguing with me about this in a public forum. Do you think you can magically go back and delete all these posts if some truly evil people came to power?<p>Nope.<p>I&#x27;m amused by the downvotes and arguments because:<p>1) You&#x27;ve publicly provided information that isn&#x27;t going to go away already to show which camp you&#x27;d end up in if the people arguing with me are right. This information isn&#x27;t vanishing simply because its posted publicly on the internet. It isn&#x27;t going to magical become invisible in the future.<p>2) I&#x27;ve said I agree with the basic premise in my parent comment and basically said it was people who were vulnerable/edge cases that are getting screwed. That is still going to the base regardless of what happens because you only need control of 51% of the electorate to remain in power. The US electorate has shown, consistently, it will believe lies.<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090903727.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09...</a>\n&quot;For now, there appears to be little political reason to back down. A Washington Post-ABC News poll taken Sept. 5 to Sept. 7 found that 51 percent of voters think Obama would raise their taxes, even though his plan would actually cut taxes for the overwhelming majority of Americans. Obama has proposed eliminating income taxes on seniors making less than $50,000 a year, but 41 percent of those seniors say their income taxes would go up in an Obama administration.&quot;<p>The ability to fabricate falsehoods and get 51% of people to believe it is a far, far greater threat than the NSA. The fact none of you seem to notice this or even care worries me more than the NSA does. If I can get 51% of people to believe any lie I tell them, I can rule any democracy in the world.",1405122704

At post.fm we&#x27;re trying to design an email client which will work offline, and synchronize data when online (IMAP isn&#x27;t sufficient for our needs) - Exchange style.

As you say - this doesn&#x27;t really work, and there&#x27;s definitely no way to handle anything remotely complex like transactions.  In our case &quot;app data&quot; is effectively all your mail and more, and we can&#x27;t expect each client to have a local copy of everything, meaning partial syncing of a collection is important for us (not something any solution out here seems to handle).<p>The solution we&#x27;ve come up with, which we&#x27;ll hopefully get to open-source one day, is to model state over time as a persistent &quot;event log&quot;, which means instead of syncing documents we sync events that clients perform, replaying events instead of document-update statements.

Assuming $20K of the $80K shortfall are taxes you wouldn&#x27;t have to pay due to earning $50K instead of $130K, you would still need to cut $60K out of expenses.

They&#x27;ve discussed it a number of times, but besides all the tooling that has been written around the SVN setup, it isn&#x27;t well-suited to their use case.  That isn&#x27;t to say that switching to git wouldn&#x27;t have benefits, or that SVN is perfect, but: It would take <i>substantial</i> development and testing effort to make it happen, as well as ALL contributors having to change how they work (not &quot;learn git&quot; (all of the other repositories for Arch are git anyway), but &quot;re-learn all the Arch-specific tools that were built around SVN, but are now built around git&quot;).<p>> Holding onto objectively inferior tools due to a lack of\n> desire to migrate because &quot;it works for me!&quot; is a huge\n> plague on technology.<p>That&#x27;s a broken argument.<p>Sure, it is in the case where an organization is hanging onto SVN because none of the developers want to take the effort to switch, and that is a drag on development.

(The &quot;users refusing to upgrade&quot; is also a drag on technology because of support costs; that is irrelevant here, but is a cause of much of the &quot;must upgrade&quot; feelings among developers)<p>But the opposite is also true, switching to the latest thing without actually evaluating why is also a HUGE plague on technology.  Git in most aspects is a far better tool than CVS.  But, there are still things that CVS and SVN are better at (managing subprojects is the biggest one).

It feels akin to the argument of “If I don’t do it, someone else would do it, so it might as well be me.”.<p>It isn&#x27;t saying that at all. The issue is not that if you don&#x27;t make weapons then someone else will do it instead. The issue is that if you don&#x27;t make weapons then you won&#x27;t be able to defend you and yours from ruffians and invaders with stones and bats who would kill your children and rape your women.<p>And when the invaders have trucks and guns instead of stones and bats then you need to have tanks and bombs, etc. Because weapons are neutral tools. In the hands of the good guys they deter the bad guys. That&#x27;s <i>why</i> it&#x27;s so important that the tools themselves not be condemned. &quot;If you outlaw guns then only outlaws will have guns.&quot;",1405120553

With &#x27;deepzoom&#x27; images composed of lots of tiles that overlap by 4 pixels (&#x27;Seadragon&#x27;) you can change the tile size from the default 254px to anything else that works with jpg and powers of two. Theoretically you could deliver thousands and thousands of tiles for a high-resolution image. You could also get the viewer to change the zoom level by a small percentage on each &#x27;move&#x27; so that anyone trying to stitch together an image from screen-grabs will have that random bonus scaling to deal with - lovely!!!<p>A half-decent programmer could reverse-de-obfuscate the image tiles into a whole image if they really wanted to, they could even post their code for that onto github, however, in all of the years that Seadragon has been around the tools to make the tiles in the first place haven&#x27;t exactly proliferated so the tools to decipher the tiles aren&#x27;t likely to get widespread circulation either.

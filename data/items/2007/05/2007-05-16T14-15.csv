22532,comment,22386,22386,0,0,startupper,,,"This assertion has little to no scientific or mathematical basis.<p>Here's how you too can make up a sensational headline:
1) Start with an assumption 
2) collect data points that prove your assertion -- leave those that don't out of the calculation.  <p>There is no 'right' age to start a company.  No age is too old.  <p>-KFC was started by Col. Sanders when he was 50 something.  <p>-John Warnock co-founded Adobe when he was 42.  <p>There are many more examples, but those are only a couple off the top of my head.<p>EDIT:  The comments in the valleywag piece contain a few more examples like Jim Clark.<p>   <p>   ",1179325867

Don't think ""YC Reject"" is going to save you. I would reject you too.<p>Your site still sucks. ""MAKE SOMETHING PEOPLE WANT"" I don't want a shitty photo sharing site. Have you used smugmug, flickr and even picasa web albums (my current favorite). These sites are close to perfect and you will NEVER catch up with them. They are easy to use and I don't think it can egt any easier. <p>Change you business plan/application to do something else. Do social networking -- (jokes)<p>PS: Keep your invites",1179325757

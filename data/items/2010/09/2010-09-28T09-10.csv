1735144,comment,1734936,1734936,0,0,thristian,,,"> But here's the problem, Debian package maintainers don't want to give up control to the responsible parties. I would more than gladly make my own .deb packages, but they refuse to let me. In fact, I plan on making packages for the major Unices in order to head them off. That's what everyone ends up doing.<p>As a user, and amateur administrator of my home machines, I've learned the hard way that third-party packages supplied by the original software vendor are, in general, utter crap. They're built against a distro two or three versions old; or they're built for Mandrake or Ubuntu instead of Red Hat or Debian; they ""install"" a tarball to /tmp which the post-installation script untars in the root directory; they don't have any dependencies declared at all but crash at startup if you don't have a particular version of libjpeg... if you're relying on the packaging system to detect file conflicts or outdated dependencies, third-party packages can be very, very scary.<p>The single biggest reason I choose Debian (and sometimes Ubuntu) is the uniformly high-quality packaging. Zed's found one problem package, and a trawl through Debian's bug tracker will no doubt find others, but the fact of the matter is that with a single command I can install almost any Free software in the world, and have it installed and set up within seconds - and Debian has years of experience figuring out how to make that work. I don't think that's a thing to be dismissed lightly.",1285667960

An individual Opzi is used by a single company or maybe even a single team within a company.  Having a bunch of other companies and teams who are already using Opzi may help your sales pitch but is not inherently necessary for your team's Opzi to function.

If I can't control every stage of the development, deployment, and distribution process, I don't want in (yes, I'm a control freak. No, I don't think necessarily a blemish on my personality, it's just who I am). If there's something wrong with how my users perceive my software, it's because of something _I_ did wrong, not because someone took my hard work and toil and perverted it with their own changes, be it making the code ugly with nasty function names or dirty hacks (in my opinion, of course) or if they distribute it in a way that makes users cringe. It's my hard work, and I deserve to be (a) in control of the user experience, and (b) attributed.<p>If you're willing to make your awesome utility/code that you've spent 5 years developing and maintaining fully available to the public, giving up all control of the end-users' perception of the package, you have a bigger heart than me. But me, I'm a selfish guy when it comes to my users, and I don't want anyone to even have the possibility of hurting them. I have _my_ users' best interest at heart, you probably don't.

1735119,comment,1734936,1734936,0,0,blasdel,,,"This is in no way specific to Ruby — if you look at the way any sufficiently advanced software you're familiar with is packaged in Debian, you'll find it to be completely fucked. Ancient versions, nonstandard configuration files, random things disabled at compile-time (often for ideological reasons), files scattered everywhere with the new locations hardcoded, with basic features broken into separate packages. My favorite is the random patches, which when they aren't in the service of the aforementioned ridiculousness, are  mostly cherry-picked from current upstream versions to 'fix bugs' without accidentally introducing features because they're afraid of new version numbers. When a patch doesn't fit those categories you really have to worry, because now they're <i>helping</i> (see OpenSSL)<p>The result is that any program or library that you use directly must be sourced from upstream, <i>especially</i> if it's less than 15 years old or written in a language other than C or C++. Luckily pretty much all of the modern programming language environments have evolved to cope with this onanistic clusterfuck.<p>Haskell has more fucked by Debian than any other language I know of — when I last had to deal with it a year ago there were two broken+old builds of GHC with different package names and mutually-exclusive sets of packages that depended on them. On top of that the version of cabal (Haskell's packaging tool) in the repository was so far out of date that you couldn't use it to build anything remotely recent (including useful versions of itself), nor could you use it with anything in Hackage (the central repo).<p>My old roommate had listened to me bitch about this stuff for years, and always dismissed me as crazy for thinking that the packaging was fucked (though he did share my hate of <i>debian-legal</i>). Last week he called me out of the blue and apologized — he'd installed Wordpress through Debian and they'd broken it up into a bunch of library packages, but still left a base skeleton of random php files and symlinks, accomplishing nothing but breakage and unportability.",1285667197

Take the object far away from any celestial bodies and you'll find it weightless. Toss it into a black hole and it's weight will approach infinity.<p>For the sake of simplicity, lets imagine that the internet is uniformly  distributed on the surface of the earth, as a single object. You will find that the gravity of the earth pulls the internet from every direction with equal force, and assuming the internet is a solid object, the net force is zero, since the opposing forces negate each other. So in essence, the internet as a single object is weightless, even on earth.<p>So that didn't work out. Lets instead assume that the internet is divided into numerous parts so that the weight of each one can be summed together to give a meaningful answer. So what is the internet? Is it the servers that run it? The huge cables that run below the oceans? Or maybe internet can be best thought of as the information it contains. Then what is information? Is it the magnetic direction of the molecules of a harddisk? Is it the dents on a CD? Or something else that can be thought of still being ""physical"" in nature? Or does information on the storage devices only truly become <i>information</i> once it is observed and digested by a human mind?<p>How much calories would it take for a human brain to go trough all the information on the internet?

Is the brain just the gray mass or it's whole history of nature and nurture? All the way to the big bang?

But there's something else that current patent law does automatically do for OS hardware that I think will turn out to be very important. Once the community creates and publishes a hardware function, it automatically becomes prior art and can never be locked away from the community by the (let's face it <i>truckloads</i>) of bad actors in the commecial patent space.<p>With the rate the open hardware community is growing, I don't doubt that it will soon the the dominant force for small scale innovation in the gadget space. I see this as a key part if the final solution to the ""patent mess"" we find ourselves in today.<p>How much prior art is there on hackaday right now?",1349974769

Is it the case that a multicore processor must have identical cores?<p>Let's say there are three tasks, A, B, and C. C depends on A and B, but A is 4x as costly as B. Adding more cores doesn't get around that inherently sequential part, so because of overhead and cost considerations it isn't worth it to parallelize. This applies to most computational tasks: as you add more cores, the effect of the sequential part dominates more and more and you get decreasing benefits.<p>But what if you have one beefy processor to deal with the heavily sequential parts, and a multitude of less impressive ones to deal with the easily parallelizable parts? Doesn't that give you the best of both worlds?<p>Is it technically infeasible for some reason?",1349974592

4641647,comment,4641428,4641428,2,0,lutusp,,,"The article doesn't mention one reason for creating inactive Twitter accounts -- to reserve a name someone else wants and wait to be bought out.<p>When I first created a Twitter account, I naturally enough wanted to use the handle ""lutusp"" that I use everywhere (here, there, everywhere). But someone who knew who I was had already created an account under that name, but one that has never been active -- not one tweet. The account holder is apparently waiting for me to offer to buy the right to use my own name (clearly someone who doesn't realize how cheap I am).<p>My other common handle, ""plutus"", is also taken, but by an actual entity with a Website -- only God knows why a company would name themselves ""plutus"", but I can't accuse them of being inactive, only masochistic.<p>Parenthetically, there is precisely one ""Paul Lutus"" in the world. Some see this as good thing :), but it means when I see some lame variation on my name like the above examples, I am immediately suspicious.<p>The Twitter name-reserving follies are a variation on the domain-squatter practice. I have a website ""arachnoid.com"" that is pretty well-known, so naturally enough people are squatting on arachnoid.org, arachnoid.biz, and arachnoid.net (""buy this domain!""), all the top-level domain (TLD) variations anyone can snap up without meeting special requirements.<p>All I can say is, when I registered my domain, I could easily have gotten control of the TLD variations, but I wasn't nearly cynical enough -- then (in 1996). As to Twitter, when I arrived it was already too late -- my name was reserved.",1349974467

When I go to the page on my Android phone, I don't see the ""Email address"" text at all, just a blank field with no indication of what goes there. I have to tap outside any field to see what that field is for.<p>I don't think labels inside fields should ever be combined with automatically putting the focus in one of the fields. That forces you to leave the label in place when the focus is on a field, which is a recipe for confusion. Conventional labels are much more friendly.<p>After I type in my email address (in the .to domain; see my profile here), it shows me a picture of myself as soon as I complete the address. That's cool, but when I hit Tab to go to the next field it says ""Did you mean mg@me.com"". Huh? Perhaps if you find that you've succeeded in fetching a gravatar, you should not use the ""did you mean"" message. The gravatar itself is a better confirmation that I've got the right email than any possible second-guessing you could do about domain names.<p>Also, your blog is pretty hard to read.

There was a TON of potential for smart watch innovation with the previous Nano. Apple even acknowledged it when they added clock faces to the Nano last year. There were very successful Kickstarter projects based on using the Nano as a smart watch. Instead of making that official, Apple fucked it all up by (yet again) completely changing the form factor.<p>My accusation is very different from the OP's because it's not based on any factual misconduct - it's simply the result of Nilay (like many other people) getting sucked into the RDF and drinking Apple's Kool-Aid far too much.

It cost you money to liquidate the assets before you get your hands on the cash.<p>Gross margin less SGA is only 30% of revenues, so maybe only $300mm-ish needs to be shaved off the cash balance from deferred revs. These liabilities must be incurred to realize the future revenues wigthout refunding back the pre-pays, good 1st approximation.<p>So, $1.0 to 1.1B is closer to the floor value.

- the ability to filter courses by tag is good (though who is deciding the tags?)<p>Things that could be improved:
- the Sign In With Twitter didn't work for me, I got an error
- I'd like to see a more detailed rating system (like rating the course on several criteria - 3 stars for material, 5 stars for instructor responsiveness, etc)
- I think the ability to up-vote or down-vote reviews would be nice
- The comment section should be more helpful in writing a review (suggest things the reviewer should talk about)<p>The value in this type of system is around the quality of the feedback.

Part of it is because I just don&#x27;t want to spend so much time in front of a screen (I use an iPad to read), and the other is because I just can&#x27;t seem to relax enough to get into reading mode, so reading only happens every other weekend when I can get away from thinking about my work from the day.<p>I guess the screen problem can be solved by getting a Kindle with e-ink, but getting the right headspace is harder.<p>I like the idea of a book-club, but the problem is I have a list of books <i>i</i> want to get through personally and so my list may not be the same as the book club. I wouldn&#x27;t read a book just because it was on this month&#x27;s reading list in the book club.<p>The book has to be of interest to me for me to participate, and there&#x27;s no knowing if interests would align well or not.",1395932392

Since the body is cooled down, all chemical reactions including those that take place in the brain are slowed down to a point where our traditional methods of looking at it suggest no activity. When it is warmed up, it should start functioning as usual.

Antivaccine beliefs crop up from time to time, apparently independently, all across the world. They are generally cultural phenomena; e.g. the polio vaccine was rejected as being part of a Western conspiracy to do nefarious things to the people getting it. I&#x27;d be more inclined to blame the fact that getting injections makes some people pretty uncomfortable.<p>I&#x27;m not actually sure how widely accepted antivaxxers are; they&#x27;re certainly vocal about their (deserved) persecution by saner people. As you mention, they&#x27;re a problem more because even small concentrated groups of antivaxxers can cause big problems to everyone around them than because there are so many; UFO junkies aren&#x27;t exactly accepted by the mainstream, but there are a lot of them in an absolute numbers sense <i>and they&#x27;re harmless</i>.<p>I can&#x27;t tell you how shocked I was when my sister&#x27;s best friend, a graduate of UC Berkeley, came into our house and started telling us about the evils of wheat. Among other preposterous claims, apparently the wheat we eat today has been genetically engineered to be nefariously addictive, and has all kinds of ill effects on your bodily health. I was able to trace most of her ideas back to this guy, the natural culmination of the gluten-free food fad:<p><a href=""http://www.wheatbellyblog.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wheatbellyblog.com/</a><p>but, as is always the case, her ideas were garbled, and attributed even more evil to wheat, compared to what is presented in that awful, scaremongering book.<p>You can&#x27;t stop completely crazy ideas from springing up in the most unlikely places, and skills, time, and access are much less protective than you might hope.<p>When Brazil had its antivax scare at the turn of the 20th century, the government showed up in full military force and vaccinated everyone anyway. That&#x27;s the sensible way to handle antivaxx beliefs.<p>This has been a long, rambling comment. Let me try to sum up:<p>- Antivaxxers aren&#x27;t doing it because they&#x27;re convinced by any research. They&#x27;re doing it as a weird cultural phenomenon, like many, many other crackpot quasireligious groups (UFOs / astrology / cryptozoology / 9/11 truthers / vegans / what have you). As with other quasireligious believers, they&#x27;re not going to be convinced by argument or evidence. What makes them different is not that people weren&#x27;t around to defend reality when they formed, it&#x27;s that their beliefs and practices are quite harmful to everyone around them.<p>- Given the long and distinguished history of antivax movements, it doesn&#x27;t make sense to me to blame this one on Andrew Wakefield and a failure to publish counterpapers in a timely manner. It makes more sense to view it as another antivax movement, fueled by whatever keeps causing and sustaining them, where the trigger is basically just a coincidence.<p>edit-addendum:<p>> Most people don&#x27;t have the skills [...] to go and view medical papers<p>This is no less true now than it was in 1998. For all of those people, they have no evidence <i>now</i> to suggest that Wakefield was wrong. The publication of research discrediting him further and further can never help; by assumption, those people cannot understand medical papers. They don&#x27;t understand Wakefield&#x27;s paper either (which is what I&#x27;m getting at when I say &quot;Antivaxxers aren&#x27;t doing it because they&#x27;re convinced by any research&quot;).",1395932142

7480733,comment,7480631,7480631,2,0,crispy2000,,,"By staying the heck out of the way.<p>In any kind of society, no matter whether centrally planned or not, there will be people who seek out and solve needs for others, with an expectation that they&#x27;ll be compensated. Even in the communist USSR, people would have side-businesses, sometimes dealing in the black market. While &quot;illegal&quot;, these businesses were able to thrive because someone was there to fulfill the needs of others.<p>One of the worst things to do is to create government programs &quot;to increase the numbers of entrepreneurs&quot;.  Why? Because while some entrepreneurs will benefit, those who benefit the most are the same characters who know how to work the government to their benefit. Example: the government has set-asides for &quot;small and minority-owned businesses&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen large companies partner with some small businesses, set a minority person as a figurehead, use their own people to successfully pursue the government contract, and laugh all the way to the bank. Small business, minorities, and even the figurehead guy don&#x27;t really benefit from the scheme, do they?<p>If you let people keep more of the money they make, rather than redistribute it in an attempt to build entrepreneurship, then those who make products or deliver services <i>that are needed</i> will benefit.

7480681,comment,7479588,7480079,3,0,aestra,,,">I do love the supplement/nutrition industry<p>Why? It is almost entirely unregulated and unsupervised. They have been known to contain unlisted ingredients, none of the ingredients they say, and dosages that differ wildly from what they are labeled as. I saw a movie where they just put some random shit into a pill (flour and stuff) and started marketing it as a supplement. This was apparently legal.<p><a href=""http://www.livescience.com/40357-herbal-products-unlisted-ingredient.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.livescience.com/40357-herbal-products-unlisted-in...</a><p>> In the study, nearly 60 percent of herbal products tested contained plant substances not listed on the label. In nearly a third of products, the main ingredient was substituted with a different product. More than 20 percent of products contained fillers such as rice, wheat and soybeans, in addition to the main ingredient.<p>>Overall, out of the 12 companies that produce herbal supplements included in the study, just two had products with no substitutions, fillers or contaminants, the researchers said<p>> Such unlisted ingredients may pose health hazards for consumers, the researchers said. For example, one produced was labeled as St. John&#x27;s wort, but actually contained the laxative plant Senna alexandrina. The laxative is not recommended for long turn use, and can cause serious side effects, such as chronic diarrhea and liver damage.<p>> 2011 study of 131 herbal tea products found that 33 percent were contaminated.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/health/policy/26herbal.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/health/policy/26herbal.htm...</a><p>>Nearly all of the herbal dietary supplements tested in a Congressional investigation contained trace amounts of lead and other contaminants<p>>The levels of heavy metals — including mercury, cadmium and arsenic — did not exceed thresholds considered dangerous, the investigators found. However, 16 of the 40 supplements tested contained pesticide residues that appeared to exceed legal limits, the investigators found. In some cases, the government has not set allowable levels of these pesticides because of a paucity of scientific research.<p>> Among the witnesses at the hearing will be Dr. Tod Cooperman, president of ConsumerLab.com, a company that has tested over 2,000 dietary supplements made by more than 300 manufacturers and has found that one in four have quality problems. According to Dr. Cooperman’s written testimony, the most common problems are supplements that lack adequate quantities of the indicated ingredients and those contaminated with heavy metals.<p>> Travis T. Tygart, chief executive of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, wrote a letter to the committee saying that some athletes have been rendered ineligible for international competitions because they took supplements that contained steroids not listed on the products’ labels. There are thousands of supplements available for sale that contain steroids or other harmful ingredients, he wrote.<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852683/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1852683/</a><p>>Case Presentation<p>> A 54-year-old woman was referred to the University of California, Davis, Occupational Medicine Clinic with a 2-year history of worsening alopecia and memory loss. She also reported having a rash, increasing fatigue, nausea, and vomiting, disabling her to the point where she could no longer work full-time. A thorough exposure history revealed that she took daily kelp supplements. A urine sample showed an arsenic level of 83.6 μg/g creatinine (normal < 50 μg/g creatinine). A sample from her kelp supplements contained 8.5 mg/kg (ppm) arsenic. Within weeks of discontinuing the supplements, her symptoms resolved and arsenic blood and urine levels were undetectable.<p><a href=""http://www.researchgate.net/publication/5292535_Nutritional_supplements_cross-contaminated_and_faked_with_doping_substances/file/3deec52274312178fb.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.researchgate.net/publication/5292535_Nutritional_...</a><p>>These investigations showed that nutritional supplements contained prohibited stimulants as\nephedrines, caffeine, methylenedioxymetamphetamie and sibutramine, which were not declared on\nthe labels. An international study performed in 2001 and 2002 on 634 nutritional supplements that were\npurchased in 13 different countries showed that about 15% of the nonhormonal nutritional supplements\nwere contaminated with anabolic-androgenic steroids (mainly prohormones).<p>>In 2005 vitamin C, multivitamin and magnesium tablets were confiscated, which contained crosscontaminations\nof stanozolol and metandienone. Since 2002 new ‘designer’ steroids such as prostanozol,\nmethasterone, androstatrienedione etc. have been offered on the nutritional supplement market. In the\nnear future also cross-contaminations with these steroids are expected. Recently a nutritional supplement\nfor weight loss was found to contain the b2-agonist clenbuterol. The application of such nutritional\nsupplements is connected with a high risk of inadvertent doping cases and a health risk.<p>This actually worries me a lot, since I am required to take an iron supplement because of chronic iron deficiency.

Shameless plug: <a href=""http://tiny-giant-books.com/backlogs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tiny-giant-books.com/backlogs.htm</a> )<p>I&#x27;ve also been a freelance writer since my teens, having been published in books, magazines, newspapers, and weeklies. And I read like heck. So I know this arena.<p>There are a few more problems the author does not mention. The number #1 problem on the internet is that everybody wants to be an author, but nobody wants to be an editor. You can click a button and poof! You&#x27;re published. Back when you had to send it to somebody, and get sometimes biting criticism, you tended to think more carefully about what you wrote. As a self-publisher, you have to be extremely paranoid about quality. And even then, what you don&#x27;t see, you don&#x27;t see. It&#x27;s hard/impossible to replace a good professional editorial staff.<p>The second problem is that the physicality of books is different from e-books. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I love e-books. But for certain things, like learning a new complex skill, I want to have physical books scattered around the office opened to certain passages with other passages dog-eared or bookmarked. E-books just ain&#x27;t the same.<p>I also wonder if we&#x27;re not selling a shitload of e-books that nobody is ever getting around to reading. A lot of people buy books (or e-books) for their <i>imagined</i> experience -- not for the real one. When you have physical books, you can see when your stack is growing large.

They sell the resulting maps to real-estate agencies and distribution companies.<p>Funny detail: their maps are more accurate than official ones on many aspects; when I asked at a conference if they’d consider giving back to the community and authorities, they’d say it wasn’t worth it, they wouldn’t take it. When pressed (fairly certain OSM would welcome and had detailed APIs for it), they confessed not trying, because it wasn&#x27;t in their commercial interest.<p>The impact of their work appears to heighten urban issues: segregation and white flight, gentrification and pricing out incumbents… But then again: that’s the obvious consequence for more information. I doubt the solution to those issue is by regulating those services.<p>Local volunteers for OSM are aware of the free riders and would consider negotiating giving back, but they don’t thing it&#x27;s worth their non-existant legal ressources.

The output data contains no zeroes, but results in almost no overhead, with the worst case being an increase of 1/254 over the original size, and the best case being zero increase. (Compare to e.g. backslash escapes of quotes in quoted strings, where the worst case doubles the output size.) You then use the now-eliminated zero byte as your record separator. This lets you stream data (with a small amount of buffering to perform the encoding) while still easily locating the ends of chunks.<p>I&#x27;ve played around with COBS but never used it in a real product, so this is not entirely the voice of experience here.

7480543,comment,7472452,7479202,2,0,mightybyte,,,"> The problem upper bounds tries to solve just does not exist in other languages because packagers are expected not to break backwards compatibility.<p>I&#x27;ll agree that Haskell moves faster and has more breaking changes, but that statement is just wrong.  Look at <a href=""http://semver.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semver.org/</a> (not related to Haskell at all) and you&#x27;ll see that the very first point on the page is about incompatible API changes.  So clearly this issue exists outside of Haskell and people have developed methods for managing it with version bound schemes.  You are arguing against rapidly changing software, not against upper bounds.  In your example where the Django server is not making backwards-incompatible changes, upper bounds wouldn&#x27;t hurt you at all because the bounds are on the major version number, but exploit fixes that don&#x27;t break backwards compatibility will only bump the minor version number.<p>Comparing Haskell to any other mainstream language in this discussion is invalid because the other languages have been around a lot longer and have reached a more stable state.  Python appeared in 1991.  The first Haskell standard appeared in 1998.  So that means Python has at least 7 years of stability on Haskell.  I would argue that Haskell gained adoption much more slowly because it is much less similar to any mainstream language that came before it, so the actual number should be larger.  Paul Graham&#x27;s essay &quot;The Python Paradox&quot; came out in 2004.  I would suggest that Haskell is just now getting close to the point that Python was at when PG wrote that essay.  That means that Python has at least 10 years on Haskell.  So if you&#x27;re comparing breaking changes in Haskell today with Python, you need to compare it with Python as it was 10 years ago.  If you think the breaking changes are not worth that much pain for you, then don&#x27;t use Haskell right now.  But you shouldn&#x27;t make that decision without educating yourself about the benefits the language has to offer.  For me, it is a small price to pay compared to the benefits I get from Haskell.<p>Only time will tell, but I predict that companies based solely on Haskell will emerge in a few years dominating their competition because they can write better quality software, iterate faster, with fewer people, more reuse, fewer bugs, and easier maintenance than companies not using Haskell.",1395930224

7480538,comment,7480278,7480278,28,0,Symmetry,,,"It&#x27;s really exciting, but here are a few worries I have about their ability to meet their performance claims:<p>1)  I don&#x27;t see that they&#x27;ll be able to save much power on their cache hierarchy relative to conventional machines.  Sure, backless memory will save them some traffic but on the other hand they won&#x27;t e able to take advantage of the sorts of immense optimization resources that Intel has, so that fraction of chip power to performance isn&#x27;t going away.<p>2) The bypass network on a conventional out of order chip takes up an amount of power similar to the execution units, and I expect that the Mill&#x27;s belt will be roughly equivalent.<p>3) I&#x27;m worried on the software front.  The differences between how they and LLVM handle pointer is causing them trouble, and porting an OS to the Mill looks to be a pretty complicated business compared to most other architectures.  It&#x27;s certainly not impossible, but it&#x27;s still a big problem if they&#x27;re worried about adoption.<p>All of which is to say, I think the 10x they&#x27;re talking about is unrealistic.  The Mill is full of horribly clever ideas which I&#x27;m really excited about and I do think their approach seems workable and advantageous, but I&#x27;d expect 3x at most when they&#x27;ve had time to optimize.  The structures in a modern CPU that provide out of order execution and the top-level TLB are big and power hungry, but they&#x27;re not 90% of power use.<p>If they&#x27;re going to hit it big they&#x27;ll probably start out in high-end embedded.  Anything where you have a RTOS running on a fast processor, and your set of software is small enough that porting it all isn&#x27;t a big problem.<p>Also, the metadata isn&#x27;t like a None in Python, it&#x27;s like a Maybe in Haskell!  You can string them together and only throw an exception on side effects in a way that makes speculation (and vector operation) in this machine much nicer.<p>EDIT:  Whatever the result of the Mill itself, it contains a large number of astoundingly clever ideas some of which would be useful even without all the other ideas.  Like you could drop in Mill load semantics to most in-order processors and you&#x27;d have to do something different with how they interact with function calls but it would still be pretty useful.<p>EDIT2:  I may sound pessimistic above, but I would still totally give them money if I were a registered investor.  The outside view just says that new processors that try to change lots of things at once is pretty bad even if, on the inside view, they have a good story for how their going to overcome the challenges they&#x27;ll face.",1395930185

You have a field that you want to shove some serialized data into in a compact way and not have to think about formatting. You could use JSON, you could use tabs or csv, but both of those require a parser.<p>With these ascii delimiters you can serialize a set of records quickly and shove them into a string, and later extract them and parse them with virtually no logic other than looking for a single character. And because it&#x27;s a control character, you can strip it out before you input the data, or replace control characters with \\x{NNN} or similar, which is still less complex than tab/csv/json parsing.<p>Granted, the utility of this is extremely limited, probably mainly for embedded environments where you can&#x27;t add libraries.

Even if we dispose of any debatable improvements in recovery from various illnesses that may be caused by reducing stress, etc., that still leaves the rather broad category of physical ailments that are largely psychosomatic (that is, the physical distress, though very real, arises as a result of or is greatly exacerbated by mental state). That being said, the purely psychological effect needs to be used responsibly, scientifically (that is, the patient needs to be monitored on the basis of more than just feeling) and in conjunction with real medicine - the peddling of woo-woo on its own by people who are essentially answerable to no-one and who believe in the woo-woo (or at least disbelieve in or pathologically distrust scientific medicine) is dangerous and deadly, and it&#x27;s just about time to put a permanent stop to it.",1395929088

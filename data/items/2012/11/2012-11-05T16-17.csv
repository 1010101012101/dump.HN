Some anecdotal evidence... years ago when I was but a youngin', I didn't get along at my company, got burned out and eventually curled up in a corner and slept/played games. Needless to say I got on the PIP (performance improvement plan). Then I got laid off eventually. I was immature. My manager sucked, but so did I for not realizing this and taking action.<p>These days, I am simply more mature, and I regret my past somewhat, but at least I am good at learning in general. If you don't regret your past, you aren't growing, everyone does. Now, after life has kicked me around, I know people well, I know how not to be a condescending jackass, and be pleasant, and get things done, and communicate to my manager honestly vs being passive aggressive etc. And I have that same inner drive to figure things out. I'm still the same person, I just don't bullshit around, I keep my mouth shut, impress people with my actions, then lo and behold, when they come to find out more info about me, I tell them, but before that, I remain an enigma. When I came to my group, some underestimated me, I didn't lash out like when I was younger, I just shut up and fixed their bugs.<p>I do think, as you allude to, certain people just have that knowing, they have it in them, but for whatever reason, maturity, bad manager, etc., they don't rise to the top.

Making it easy for developers to come over from x64 while juicing the performance per clock would be a big win.<p>P.S. I'm not a CPU expert by any means. My understanding is that x86_64 has a big legacy overhead from implementing backwards compatibility with x86, and a goal of Itanium was to reduce the amount of the die dedicated to backwards compatibility.

You could probably get it to the point that it would require $n$ simultaneous point mutations to disable the ""death gene"" without killing the organism. What you'd really want to worry about is whole chunks of genome being deleted (either through a serious accident in reproduction or a virus).

So believe me when I say that a $32K base is not going cut it.  Especially in a poor economy like now.  Even now it is easy to find a tech sales job at that kind of base.  Poor economies are when companies need superstar business developers the most.  In bad times candidates want a higher base and are willing to take a lower upside.  In growth times, like the late 90's, a good salesperson will want a high upside and possibly equity at the cost of a very low to zero base.  So, to get a ""star"", you'll need to pay at least $100K base.  Maybe much more in the NY area; most of my experience is in Texas.  Any salesperson, in the current economy, who would even consider this type of offer is not someone that I would even talk to.  (I have experienced exceptions to this, but they are so rare that you might as well hope to win a lottery.)  Superstar sales people are exceptionally rare and often unusual people.  But they can make you a lot of money if you pay them and lead them properly.<p>Regarding the ""have someone send your resume"" issue, unlike some commenters, I don't really have a problem with it.  I think it is kind of fun and interesting.  But I suspect that they did this because they are inundated with unqualified candidates.<p>Here is how to solve the problem.  Get on the phone and call one of the groups like Aerotek or Lucas and Assoc.  These companies tend to hire young sharp people but lose them after only a couple of years.

Maybe it's just their postition as an also-ran in a basically monopolized market (desktop CPU manufacture), but I've always seen them as ahead of the curve. They were optimizing per-cycle performance with Athlon while Intel was still pushing higher clocks. They moved to 64-bit while Intel was still pushing higher clocks. Now that Intel has turned their attention more fully to optimizing their per-clock performance (and pulled ahead by a full generation in fab technology), AMD hasn't really had a leg to stand on. Price and low-power are OK, but ARM is already strong in those areas, and ARM servers are becoming more likely by the year. AMD needs something more transformative than massively-parallel chips and high frequencies.<p>I know it's a long shot, but could they try to go the way Intel did with Itanium, and invent a new architecture/instruction set specifically designed for server workloads? People have broadly expressed interest in ARM, but the support isn't there right now. If AMD had a new RISC architecture with awesome support and incentives for developers to target it, they might be able to steal share from x64 and ARM chips.",1352133345

- outsource the problem by using an indemnified payments system (a payment processor who do their own fraud checks and don't pass on any chargebacks to you). Pros: easy. Cons: expensive and lots of valid payments will be refused.<p>- Use an e-wallet that usually has few/no chargebacks, eg Skrill & Neteller. Pros. Easy, not too expensive. Cons: more difficult for people to make payments as they need to create an account with the e-wallet first.<p>- Use services to help with your fraud detection. Eg. Iovation. Pros: you can keep it easy for your customers to make payments. Cons. a lot of work to implement (relatively speaking).<p>- Use bitcoin, eg bitcoin247.com. Pros. no chargebacks ever. Cons. about 0.00001% of your customers use Bitcoin.<p>Edit: I forgot to add:
- require 3D Secure / Verified by Visa payments. This removes the chargeback liability from the merchant in most cases and shifts it to the card owners bank. Pros. much fewer chargebacks. Customers can still deposit directly on your site using their card (apart from the 3D redirect). Cons: entering 3DS details another barrier to making payments so will reduce payments. Plus I'm not sure of the penetration of 3DS cards in the US.",1352132320

4744149,comment,4739582,4739582,1,0,xvolter,,,"The idea of phising out your data through the UI would be extremely difficult. There would be three methods you could attempt to gain access through a UI. The first and simplest to try is to check in memory, it's possible the application stores some data in memory after loading it from your database. This is a minimal risk with certain types of applications, Java based or Web applications are protected through security layers which make any information that is in memory useless. The second method is to use an injection, this primarily only works on Windows, and it would be a virus that would try to get a hook into your password manager to try and gain access programmatically to variables and memory. This is a threat to desktop applications, but again, a minimal risk to Java or Web based applications protected by the JVM or the browser's locking of the JavaScript. The third is the most useless for a hacker to attempt, since it is fickle and unlikely to work, it'd be for them to automate mouse clicks and keyboard actions to either the OS or the application in an effort to copy your data. This would be fickle since the UI can change, it has to be very precise actions, probably hard coded X,Y cords and therefore very likely to break - and if you are using the computer at the time it tries this, you will notice things going on.<p>Chrome plugins are not easy to gain access to. Chrome is a very secure browser, and they lock their V8 JavaScript engine so no two plugins can talk to each other unless they setup special hooks. They also run the entire application in a locked state, which both prevents plugins from accessing the operating system and from other applications from easily accessing Chrome without a special plugin.<p>Web-based password managers offer many benefits over desktop-based password managers. The risks for desktop based are there are many things they have to fight against and also maintain your database in a state that is secure against extreme bruteforce hacking attempts.<p>Web based are protected by their application and the browser, at the same time 3rd party plugins can pose risk, but developers of these can easily protect against interference of plugins and users can do so easily as well by disabling plugins on that site.<p>To both keyloggers are minimal risk, most password managers you use not to record your password but to create new account entries, and you are likely to generate a unique password for each site, therefore keylogger would be useless. Clipboard monitor may pose a risk, but applications like KeePass avoid this by using their Auto Login feature, and web/Chrome extensions avoid this by auto-filling or auto-logging in your login details.<p>The risk of a key logger getting your master password is also minimal risk for most applications. Most tend to offer ""access codes"" or ""pin numbers"" in addition to your password, allowing you to enter a small additional password or your original password via an on screen keyboard, which negates risk of keyloggers.<p>The idea that a password manager is a ""single point of failure"" is also wrong. The primary point of failure will be the end user releasing their login to their password manager, not the password manager being hacked. Because all passwords managers worth using encrypt your data, bruteforcing would take years per user. If any online manager were hacked, your data would be one of thousands and would likely never be decrypted to begin with. If it's a desktop application, those tend to encrypt with even stronger types of encryptions because they can waste the CPU on it; which means even more years to bruteforce if your database is given out.<p>The risk is in the end user, if he/she leaks her password or gets a virus/keylogger to get his/her master password. In which case this is just the same as using the same password across all sites.<p>I have heard of people using a single password and adding the website's domain they are registering under with an SHA1. Therefore if my password is ""password"" and I registering a facebook account, I'd go to an SHA1 site, enter ""facebook.compassword"" and get ""ca2e97dbded3dc7af83446a225471fc6a721a1f9"" as my password.<p>Modernly bruteforcing works quite quickly, so longers passwords are higher security than having a short-special character. Most sites require a min length of a password, usually 5 or 6 characters, therefore a password of ""f1v3r"" would be easy to brute force if I know the min length, I could get to that in a matter of minutes, whereas a long password like ""thisisalamepasswordbutitslongsohahahaha"" would take forever to try and bruteforce, and no dictionary hack method would work against that.<p>People who use password managers still make the mistake in using an insecure password with it, allowing people to simply bruteforce into their account, which is just as bad as using a weak password on websites directly, making the use of a password manager pointless.<p>Personally, and I have bias to this, I recommend Cyphrd.com - it's an online password manager that is well above any other online password manager for security, they are well protected and the weakest point is the end user, which they do all they can to help you protect yourself. Additionally they do more than just passwords, it's also a secure note taking service, stores credit cards, files/documents, contact and profile information for people, anything - since they encrypt all the data client-side and are open source with their encryption and are also constantly checked for security holes and patched before any are made into production, it's a great service.",1352131920

For example, Javascript lacks big integers, and is a dynamic language.  My thought is that decoupling the HLL from the runtime would allow for faster evolution, because it's hypothetically easier to add new opcodes to a bytecode and VM than it is to make large shifts to a high-level language.  Consider the whole dynamic thing in particular - .NET has a great VM with pretty good support for both static and dynamic languages.  Java didn't, but again we aren't strictly required to repeat the mistakes of the past.

The DNS servers are running in a separate network and connect with TerrificDNS controller with a secure connection. eNom API requires IP address verification. Credit cards are stored completely outside the web service. I've paid attention to common attacks (injection, CSRF, XSS and mass assignment).<p>- Points of failure. DNS is a difficult thing to handle because the uptime is critical. That's why TerrificDNS Anycast uses Amazon Route 53.

Better you talk of universal human values.<p>I understand your sentiment, but 1) you're making an ""ad hominem"" against Christianity, which I could argue is not justified but in any case is not pertinent, and 2) what you're asking ultimately doesn't make sense.<p>We're having a discussion about what is or is not moral. Any answer you can give necessarily depends on views which can only be classified as religious, even if you are a purely a materialist; they involve the purpose of existence, what it means to be human, etc.<p>Consider this exchange:<p>A: ""We should not commit genocide.""
B: ""Why?""
A: ""Because protecting life is a universal human value.""
B: ""It's not universal if I don't agree with it. Why should I care?""
A: ""Because we can't survive as a species unless we protect one another.""
B: ""What if I don't care about the species, but only about myself?""
A: ""Genocide is still wrong. You shouldn't do it.""
B: ""Says who?""<p>Ultimately A has to answer ""there is a larger moral principle outside of you which, whether you agree with it or not, you are obligated to obey"", which is a religious statement.<p>The only other option is ""many of us prefer that you don't do this and we will use force to stop you."" That's pragmatic, but it's not about morality at all; it could just as well be applied to playing the bagpipes.<p>You can't exclude religion from moral debates because morality is inherently about religion.",1352131236

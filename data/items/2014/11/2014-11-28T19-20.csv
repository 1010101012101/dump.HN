However, unless it&#x27;s your first job out of poverty, if you are one paycheck away form being homeless, you are doing something considerably wrong with your life.<p>Privileged much? If you are <i>one</i> paycheck away from being utterly destitute, living on the streets and foraging in trash cans for food, then yeah, there&#x27;s a problem. The problem being a lack of social programs by your government.<p>&quot;Techies&quot; may be more than <i>one</i> paycheck away from destitution, but unless they&#x27;ve won the startup-IPO/acquisition lottery, they&#x27;re not <i>that</i> many more paychecks from homeless, especially in the case of life-altering disease or accident.",1417204750

It almost feels like they are going out of their way to make it as different as possible.<p>Different compared to: most programming languages? Systems programming languages? Just C/++?<p>> I mean, you see how Haskell is doing, and a lot of people blame that on the absolutely alien syntax to anything programmers are used to.<p>Its syntax fits how it operates. Should Haskell have -() at the end of functions, like C-like and ML? No, since Haskell uses partial application and currying - the ()-stuff would likely end up as cruft. A function of three arguments in Haskell is <i>not</i> passing in three values as a tuple: it is a function that takes one argument and returns a function - that function is a function that takes one argument and returns a function... how is that clear when you write it as `f(x,y,z)? Not to mention if you partially apply it.<p>Can you write Haskell code as a sequence of declarations and expressions? Arguably no, since it has non-strict evaluation; having a list of declarations and expressions would be misleading, since they can really be evaluated in any order.<p>What <i>can</i> be contested is the significant layout (though it is optional) and user-definable operators. Though I think Haskell code would become really crufty without operators, since they sometimes make expressions more clear than a series of prefix-oriented functions.",1417204726

A few points to elaborate this.<p>1. Types absolutely can capture (trivially often) invariants which can never be satisfactorily covered by unit tests. This is the difference between <i>proof</i> and <i>evidence</i>.<p>2. Unit tests are far easier to write for many kinds of program behavior. Even though you can encode essentially anything you want into sufficiently powerful type systems, their proofs can be too challenging to practically build.<p>3. Type checking works <i>very</i> differently from testing. It&#x27;s not red-green-refactor. It&#x27;s more like &quot;describe your problem in types and then slowly discover the only possible program which is correct&quot;. The feedback cycle here is very fast, but sometimes more inhospitable. Major research focus is on making this better, though. I&#x27;d say some of the most advanced HCI work is being done in dependently typed proof systems... but it&#x27;s targeted only at people who understand and use dependently typed proof systems to begin with.<p>4. Unit tests often duplicate functionality which is trivially and automatically inferred by a type system. This is why, for certain invariants, types are &quot;free&quot; and unit tests are both incomplete and a big violation of DRY.<p>So, essentially, the unit tests which get written for you automatically are the trivial ones which are inferable properties. A dynlang usually does not have sufficient structure to enable this inference so you have to cover it with unit tests or contracts. More advanced, un-inferable properties can be handled and checked on compilation as well, but typically it takes some effort to build this stuff. Interestingly, though, you usually do it with heavy automation driven by the (partial) inference that the compiler provides—it becomes a conversation between you and the compiler as you develop the program which satisfies the type specification you gave.",1417203888

What I have found is that there are no shortcuts around investing a massive amount of time reading textbooks and trying to solve problems/figure out proofs.  The time investment itself is what bakes the knowledge into your head.<p>This probably isn&#x27;t what you wanted to hear, but at least do weigh these thoughts in.",1417202184

off with him.  &quot;Co-founder disputes&quot;?  Yup, 
they are likely.<p>The result is, I&#x27;ve just had to do more of the
work, say, <i>serially</i> instead of in parallel.
That&#x27;s not all bad:  (1) I understand more of
the work, really all of it, because I did all
of it (the co-founder and I broke off before
he contributed anything).  (2) I saved time and
effort <i>coordinating</i> with a co-founder.<p>Sure, a VC might say, &quot;That your candidate 
co-founder didn&#x27;t do much suggests that he
was not really impressed with the project.

approach is to have a big, successful company,

have the wife with two young kids and with

for as much as he had to bring, still he had
some serious flaws in his character.<p>So, find another co-founder?  Not so easy.  
Easier just to do the work!  For a co-founder,
some of the usual recommendations are to select 
someone with good paper qualifications and have
known and worked well with for years.  Okay,
my list of such people is exhausted.  So, 
net, I&#x27;m a solo founder.<p>Again, the US, border to border, from crossroads,
villages, and towns up to the largest cities, is
just awash with solo founders of successful <i>Main Street

Moreover, an explanation into what went behind each step? If the logic can't be explained in plain english, I'm always a bit sceptical.",1214747362

Just put dumb terminals everywhere and string coax.  A printer was just a dumb terminal, too.  Everything ran on the server.<p>Oh for the good old days.<p>Never mind, they're back.  Except dumb terminals are now ""thin clients"" and the host is now the ""cloud"".",1214744548

My company, say, Trusted-Web-App-Systems,\nwould make a program called TrustEnv. When you run TrustEnv on\na server, it creates a trusted environment into which you can\ninstall a web app.<p>I give TrustEnv to Online-Spreadsheets.com for free.\nOnline-Spreadsheets.com installs TrustEnv on one of its\nservers; a trusted environment is created. They then install\ntheir web app into this trusted environment.<p>Online-Spreadsheets.com cannot easily extract any customer\ndata being processed within this trusted environment, despite the\nfact that it's running on their own server.<p>Big-Car-Company can now connect to Online-Spreadsheets.com's\n server (the one running TrustEnv) and use the spreadsheet web app with assurance\nthat their financial data is not easily copied, leaked, or spied on.<p>I would charge a fee to corporate customers like Big-Car-Company\nto use web sites protected with TrustEnv. My job would be to write\nTrustEnv, to convince corporate customers that they need it, and\nto convince web app providers to install TrustEnv because there\nis corporate demand for it. I would not run any web apps myself.",1214744453

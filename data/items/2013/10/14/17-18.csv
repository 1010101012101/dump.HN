For example if I see your application, I&#x27;m gonna ignore most of your resume and what you said you did in grad school, find your first first author paper (and all subsequent ones), pull them up and skim them, and decide if you have a clue.<p>cultivate friends who work in the software industry.  listen to how they differ from academia.  Many people in academia are the world expert in some specific problem, but have trouble transferring that knowledge outside the sphere.  Especially bad is people who are stuck in a long-term &quot;this is how it&#x27;s done&quot; attitude.  I find a lot of people in life sciences to be terrible at big data because they embedded poor learning/knowledge and can&#x27;t unlearn it.<p>understand what industry does, why, and how.  Industry exists to make money.  Period.  You need to learn how to work in that kind of environment.<p>spend a lot of time learning to distinguish between &quot;feeder&quot; job positions and &quot;bespoke&quot; job positions, and identifying the latter.  Ex-scientists do best with bespoke job positions that match their interests, rather than feeder jobs that dump you in whatever &quot;fungible&quot; SWE position the company thinks you belong in.<p>you should learn politics and how hiring works.  There is no easy way to do this, but your prof probably hires people and has some opinions.  I had one prof who had everybody in the group evaluate every resume in detail then rank people by score.  if the score was above a threshold, they were invited in for interviews, and scored again (several times).  This has been my experience in industry as well.  If you understand the metric, and can tailor your application for it, you&#x27;re in good shape.",1381773555

The transport cost was baked into the retail price in both examples.  I suspect it was substantially higher for the quinoa; its still baked into the retail cost of both.<p>In comparison, an externality would be using my wifes prius to pick up a quarter cow from the butcher shop instead of a SUV.  The price of the cow is constant but total environmental damage depends how its shipped.  There are enough organic farms in my area that its assumed you&#x27;ll pick up locally so there&#x27;s a fixed price and you handle your own shipping aka drive out to the farm and back.  My wife is arranging a quarter cow and I&#x27;m told its about 50 miles round trip, which is only about a half hour away.  I can see how this business model wouldn&#x27;t work for people living in Las Vegas or another desert.<p>That money goes somewhere.  If I give someone 2.5 times as much money, they Could theoretically do 2.5 times as much &quot;bad stuff&quot;.  There seems to be a lot of hostility toward that obvious logical idea, no idea why.  Think about it... local oil change place down by the river... if 200 people each give them $20 they can dump two barrels of used motor oil in the river.  Now if only 100 people give them $20, how do you propose they&#x27;ll dump the same two barrels of used motor oil in the river, if they only have one barrel anyway?<p>If I hire a repairman to repair my rain gutters, he can only afford to keep his old truck running.  If I pay 3 times as much so he installs new gutters, he now has enough dough for a downpayment on a new truck, so he buys a new truck.  It seems blindingly obvious which transaction results in more environmental damage... more money meant new gutters instead of fixing them, and a new truck.  Less money means neither.<p>You can fool the finances for awhile, but not forever.  $10 of something greenwashed is inherently going to cause more total damage than something the opposite of greenwashed but only $4, especially if they&#x27;re basically the same thing sold by the same type of people.",1381773158

But for the most part, it&#x27;s all cash everywhere and a lot of it.<p>We are contemplating the exodus in a few years but not so much because of prices, but schools. Before I had kids, I was in step with SF politics / justifications of how things are done here. But, of course, after kids you&#x27;re like &quot;hey, wait a minute&quot;. The school lottery is a family bug spray here. It&#x27;s not just the fact that you&#x27;re kid could be:<p>a) bused to a different area of the city away from the possible school right across the street from you\nb) bused to a crappy school across the city<p>but also that this destroys neighborhoods. When I grew up (in southern california), I went to school with all the kids in my neighborhood. Not here, that would be too simple. So what this does is forces you to east bay or north bay if you don&#x27;t want to partake in this social experiment and can&#x27;t afford private school (I won&#x27;t even mention the fact that even if you can afford private school, there&#x27;s massive competition to then get into one).<p>All in all, this puts huge pressure on parents and they have to ask the question &quot;do I want to be part of a social experiment where my kids won&#x27;t even go to school with other neighborhood kids or do I just want them to go to a good school so they can grow up and then have some sort of normal life&quot;?<p>So, the reality I see consists of 2 groups (of which we have friends in both): those that can&#x27;t afford to buy or our outbid on everything and those parents that can&#x27;t afford or are out-competed on private schools.<p>That said, I love SF. I&#x27;ve live here for 20+ years. I&#x27;ll always love it here. Do I hold a grudge towards the city? Nope.

There&#x27;s a diminishing returns thing going on where there are a whole bunch of possible research avenues open, so the more money they put in the lower percentage return they get.  When the percentage return drops below what they could get from other investments, they put money in those investments instead.<p>To the extent that drugs start to have higher profits then the greedy executives will see that they can make even more money by investing more money in drug research, possibly much more than the increased profits but also possibly much less.

6548530,comment,6547791,6548369,2,0,loceng,,,"Cheap everything, including drugs, is the value that free markets are supposed to create, to lead to the cheapest - and patents aren&#x27;t supportive of this. Regarding people who say this research and discoveries wouldn&#x27;t have happened without ability to patent - there are plenty of researchers, many, if not the majority, who do their work because they want to help people and the field interests them - so if they have their living costs taken care of, and access to the tools they need, they&#x27;ll be happy and the research would be discovered. The U.S. pushed on the capitalist system to the extremes, and it leads to the acceleration of innovation - though we have enough basic science and technology figured out now, where we should be focusing on taking care of people properly, which we&#x27;re currently doing a poor job of - doing a good job is where free market value is supposed to lead. Free market capitalism, without protectionism (no longer free market - a popular term hijacked by those in control), leads to the cost of production getting as close to the next unit of production being $0. If something is $0 then everyone can benefit from it. This is why the internet is so valuable, invaluable, and hugely important in the world&#x27;s progression. If you have an internet connection, then the cost of acquiring the benefit from software created or receiving information is basically $0. Right now though the positive benefits of unchecked capitalism don&#x27;t outweigh the negative effects that it also generates, fosters. Without patents and the such then the world would benefit in the same way - everyone can very cheaply benefit from software. The problem is many countries have aligned themselves with being in a controlling state, to use leverage for short-term gain - though it is only temporary, and only lasts so long as you maintain control - and control is costly. If the whole world was fitting the bill for new research, the cost to each of us would be practically $0; I won&#x27;t go deep into the idea that money isn&#x27;t real either, and that if we were all in service to everyone else, then everyone would be very well taken care of - we&#x27;re not born into this construct so it&#x27;s very hard for most people to visualize this experience of living this way, or to feel safe and secure.",1381772165

6548525,comment,6547502,6548374,10,0,mrb,,,"No. What you are missing is that there <i>was</i> a one-time window of opportunity for attackers due to the ASIC tech not having been deployed on the Bitcoin network 10 months ago. But now that the network is rapidly adopting ASICs, the network speed has been <i>doubling every month</i> for the last 10 months, so this window is quickly closing...<p>For example, if an attacker wanted to attack Bitcoin, they would have to get funding today, develop or acquire an ASIC design, build and develop a ~150 meggawatt datacenter, all within the next 6 months, to have a chance to attack the network.<p>Details: at 2.2 Phash/s today, 6 months from now we should be around 2.2 * 2^6 = ~150 Phash/s. The best ASICs, 28nm KncMiner, are approximately 100 ~Ghash/s and 100 Watt each. So the attacker would have to build 150 Phash/s of these to clearly outperform the network: that is 1.5 million chips at 150 meggawatt total. And to plan for a potential delay of 30 days, the attacker would have to build not 150 Phash/s but 300 Phash/s of ASICs to attack the network. 3 million chips. 300 meggawatt datacenter. For comparison, Facebook spent $210 million on their 28 meggawatt Prinevill datacenter. So a 300 meggawatt datacenter would probably cost $2 billion. Therefore I doubt such an attack against Bitcoin would be even within NSA&#x27;s capabilities. They can&#x27;t even get their Utah datacenter to run correctly and it has been delayed by more than 1 year: <a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/2052960/nsa-data-center-suffers-meltdowns-is-delayed-by-a-year-report-says.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2052960/nsa-data-center-suffe...</a>",1381772133

And secondly profits gained are always reinvested in research and development.<p>Paying more for something does not make it better especially in the realm of healthcare. There are lots of reports and studies that show that American spending on healthcare is one of the highest in the world and among comparable nations it&#x27;s health outcomes are the lowest (basically american consumers are getting fleeced). Here is an article from our friends at Fox News <a href=""http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/07/10/united-states-health-outcomes-far-worse-than-other-comparable-nations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.foxnews.com/health/2013/07/10/united-states-healt...</a><p>So paying more for healthcare does not mean better outcomes.<p>To bring it back to the drugs debate, perhaps it is the American consumers that are getting ripped off and paying higher amounts for drugs doesn&#x27;t result in better drugs being developed but instead just results in higher profits for drug companies.<p>Drug companies are private enterprises. They don&#x27;t exist for the public good, but they exist to make money. So higher profits WILL result in more money being removed and not invested in R&D.

6548468,comment,6546257,6547975,3,0,cheald,,,"Hi, author here. That&#x27;s a fair question! The database code I presented there isn&#x27;t just to database-ify sessions, but to provide user->sessions association, which <i>none</i> of the existing stores do. That technique is applicable to AR stores as well as others, and essentially provides users with control over their list of purportedly active sessions. The first solution I presented was just a simple server-enforced timeout on sessions which doesn&#x27;t require any DB work.<p>I think it&#x27;s still worthwhile to use CookieStore even if you&#x27;re going to go to the DB, because:<p>1. You only do DB round-trips for cookies that contain a valid user ID, and you&#x27;re going to be pulling that user record <i>anyway</i>, so the net effect is a few extra bytes over the wire on DB work you were going to be doing anyway. Critically, this means that anonymous users aren&#x27;t going to be generating sessions that you have to store and validate on every page with a form (as forms use csrf_token which generates a session!)<p>2. Additionally, less data over the wire between the app and DB. You&#x27;re going to have a small list of active sessions; you could enforce that as a to a small number to ensure it stays small.<p>3. You retain CookieStore&#x27;s invulnerability to session fixation.<p>4. No sweeping!<p>You can still put most of the work on the client, and only keep the verification bits on the server. Of course, the same technique is applicable to DB-backed stores as well, as a means to provide a mechanism for users to manage their sessions.",1381771309

Even more confusingly there are small time farmers who sell both plants and meats yet have about the same political outlook as they slop the hogs or spray the fields.  Your ascribing a large difference in customers, which probably does exist, to somehow apply to a relative monoculture of suppliers, where I don&#x27;t think a major difference exists.

But it&#x27;s a pretty safe bet that if things start to slip downhill, those setbacks won&#x27;t make him any less determined.<p>If a person&#x27;s passion springs from their success, then they&#x27;ll be discouraged when setbacks inevitably happen.  Paul&#x27;s model seems better: (a) doggedly pursue (b) something you&#x27;re pretty sure will succeed.  It&#x27;d be hard to doggedly pursue something that you&#x27;re not already passionate about.<p>In fact, that pattern seems common.  Drew had decided to commit himself exclusively to Dropbox before even applying to YC; Airbnb&#x27;s founders flew to NYC every week during YC to talk to users; Watsi&#x27;s founders would probably do Watsi whether or not it was a huge success; etc.  In every case it seems like their passion was independent of their success, because none of them were willing to give up under any circumstances.  That&#x27;s quite a different situation than someone whose determination depends on a positive feedback loop of success.",1381770863

There was an HN post in which a sports coach was quoted describing how a system consisting of good habits lead to consistent successes, as opposed to a goal-based approach that lead to non-consistent, one-off successes.<p>The idea is that you create a framework of good habits that keeps you focused on a task at hand, and that also forms as a mental safety-net in case of failure (thus, not pushing you off the wagon). Using a habitual process, you can make incremental progress overall (keep improving the framework) and you keep adding or removing features (goals) depending on the demands from your system.

It&#x27;s the survival of the fittest here, so make sure that you&#x27;re fit and good at what you do before you make your move to SF. Good luck!",1381770091

They hardly compare like and like in the same rows; purposefully only displaying information that is perceived true for each.

Dropship exploits this system for filesharing by lying to the Dropbox servers and saying that it already owns a copy of the file.<p>For example, Person A wants to distribute a copy of a CD or something. They upload the file to Dropbox normally. They then use Dropship to create something describing that file, which they then publish.

    By using the same API as the native client, Dropship pretends to sync a
    file to the dropbox folder without actually having the contents. This bluff
    succeeds because the only proof needed server-side is the hash of each 4MB block
    of the file, which is known. The server then adds the file metadata to the folder,
    which is, as usual, propagated to all clients. These will then start downloading
    the file.

Vaguely in the same class as the net-neutrality issue, of trying to control the distribution channels rather than just competing on a level playing field.",1281567597
1596496,comment,1594479,1594684,0,0,briancarper,,,"Many huge Java frameworks are painfully over-complex, but personally I make good use of a lot of ""tiny"" Java libraries.  e.g. if I want to calculate an MD5 checksum or pluralize a word, there's usually a bit of Java out there for that already.  Joda-Time is a good example of a clean Java library that's fairly painless to use from Clojure.<p>And then sometimes people have written Clojure wrappers around Java frameworks.  Ring/Compojure as a thin layer over Java servlets is a good example.  clojure.contrib.sql is a thin wrapper around JDBC, so that Clojure can already talk to a wide variety of databases.<p>In that case you get the benefit of a solid codebase as well as the benefit of a clean Lispy interface.  Not sure how much more you could ask for.  It would likely take years to reproduce all of that work in pure Clojure.",1281567594

1596494,story,,,6,0,alister,"Ask HN: Six reasons why P=NP doesn't kill encryption",,"What if the proof that P!=NP is wrong and it turns out that P=NP?<p>I've heard people say that this kills encryption, or at least public-key cryptography.  But does it?  Perhaps it wouldn't be as dreadful as people think.<p>Here is my take on why cryptography will survive even if P=NP:<p>1. One-time pads are provably secure. No matter what's discovered in mathematics, one-time pads will continue to give perfect secrecy for pre-arranged messages with people you know. Yeah, it's no good for online commerce, https, etc.<p>2. Quantum cryptography will still be secure. It needs new hardware and can't be implemented purely in software.<p>3. Focusing on RSA, P=NP implies that factoring has a polynomial-time solution. OK, so the fast algorithm must exist, but who's to say that it'll be found even within the next 100 years? It's the same situation as we have now and we manage to live with the uncertainty.<p>4. Sticking with RSA, maybe the ""fast"" factoring algorithm will turn out to have order n^1000. So factoring a 1000-bit RSA key will take up to 1000^1000 steps. In comparison, an exhaustive search for a 256-bit AES key takes around 2^256 steps. Since 1000^1000 is much greater than 2^256, and we consider AES to be secure, we should consider that RSA would remain secure as well.<p>5. Again with RSA, let's suppose that a fast factoring algorithm is found and that it is indeed fast -- say on the order of n^10. That means that a 1000-bit RSA key can be cracked in 1000^10 = 10^30 steps; that's about 2^100. That would be much better than DES (2^56) but much worse than any key size of AES.<p>But there's an obvious solution: just increase the RSA key size to 1,000,000 bits. Now the work factor is 1000000^10 = 10^60; that's about 2^200. Now you're back in the neighborhood of AES again -- not as good as AES256, but a lot better than AES128.<p>Million bit RSA keys shouldn't be a problem on any modern computer except maybe smartcards. A million bits is only 125 kilobytes; we're constantly loading 100 KB images when we're browsing, so a few 125 KB key exchanges during an https connection shouldn't pose a bandwidth problem either.<p>6. It might be possible to invent public-key cryptosystems that use complexity classes beyond P and NP. Does any already exist?<p>I'm certain about #1, but I'd like to know if I've made mistakes or wrong assumptions on the other points.",1281567583

Look at the salaries for PhD Chemists (published by ACS, as well as GS pay scales), private industry looks to be at least 10-20% higher than Govt grades.  Google is your friend, albeit a wordy one...<p>And I think people forget that the GS retirement system changed for those hired in 1984 onwards.  Before that, they had a pretty sweet system that didn't involve social security - so they could retire, work 10 years and double dip.  For newer workers, they paid into and used the social security system from the start, making double dipping much much harder.  Sorta sucked.<p>And the raises were terrible - in the mid 80's I saw 3%, 0%, 3% and 2% raises.  No bonuses, stock options, etc.<p>So maybe the average private worker is paid less than the average government worker.

Within the first week it received 10,000 downloads and ultimately downloads went up to 100,000. That was only possible because Mozilla would feature newest addons on the front page with no lobbying efforts required on the developer's side. Three years ago, there were a couple of links near the middle of the Mozilla page to the newest addons. Now, there is a link to sort by ""recently added"" near the top of the page, so visitors are one click away from seeing the most recent. Also, there is a sort by ""recently updated"" option. I remember people frequently updating and seeing their extensions remain in the ""most recent"" section.<p>For finding similar sites, I personally use xmarks and similarsites.com. (Fo)xmarks obviously has a firefox extension. Similarsites.com has an extension with around a million downloads; don't know if the chicken came before the egg, though.<p>You could bundle some functionality into your addon like quantcast/alexa/pagerank data push it as an SEO tool.<p>An ironic usage of your website just occurred to me:\n1.

For federal employees, the benefits are about 50% of the salary.<p>Now, since large components of benefits (notably healthcare) are essentially fixed, independent of salary, then if private-sector jobs tend to be of a different class that are lower paid, then that fixed portion of benefit ought to make the benefit <i>rate</i> be higher for those private jobs.<p>But just the opposite is shown in the data. Not only do pub sec jobs get paid more, but they get a higher rate of benefits on that pay.<p>I can't conceive of any explanation for this difference that could be in any way equitable. All I can see is that pub sec workers get an obscene amounts of benefits relative to what I and my colleagues get -- yet the ones paying for that are, in fact, me and my colleagues.",1281564097

We don't need to run things with our private data on third party servers.<p>There is a way out: browsers have very powerful JS engines and it is possible to do client-side processing and even store private data encrypted somewhat securely without the service provider having access. But since this concept doesn't lead to profits it is completely disregarded. There are many systems using this approach, like password managers and secure email services.

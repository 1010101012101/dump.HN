3063835,comment,3061860,3063746,5,0,lsc,,,">That all being said, you are basically a fair weather friend and, to be perfectly honest, you'll never see the rewards that only come from sticking through the hard times, which is actually your loss (IMHO).<p>Can you really be ""Friends"" with an entity who has a legal responsibility to ""increase shareholder value?""  I mean, sure, I have a relationship with the corporation, and there is trust involved (well, mostly they are trusting me.  I'm just trusting them to deliver up my paycheck, and while they are usually late, I almost always get paid in the end, so they are trusting me a lot more than I am trusting them.)  but yeah, I don't think I can say I'm friends with a legal fiction.<p>I think that if google falls upon hard times, you will see that they are also ""fair weather friends""  -  It's possible that google employees, after being shown such kindness and loyalty during the good times, will feel very betrayed.<p>And rewards?  What rewards?   It's very rare that employees get substantial rewards when the business does well.   It happened with google, yes, but that's the exception, not the rule.<p>But then, really, I don't actually want to be an employee.   Right now, I'm not. (I mean, technically I'm an employee of prgmr.com, but I'm also the majority shareholder, so I don't think that counts.)   But, sometimes I need more money than I can earn on my own (I'm not a very good business person)  and in those cases, I usually look for short-term work.<p>The thing is, short-term work is pretty miserable for people who actually want to be part of the family (or, as you said, the standing army.  An apt description;  The thing that scares me the most about enlisting would be the fact that you can't quit.)  They feel like they are being used and abused.   And sometimes, companies need short-term work.   It's hard, really, to go tell someone who is the type that expects loyalty ""Hey, you- help us evaluate these outsourcing companies that will do your job after we fire you.""   or ""go write an automation system that will mean we can fire 4/5ths of the people on your team""    But a mercenary?  sure, why not.  I want to be here forever even less than you want me to be here forever.<p>When I do work for other people, the best case, I think, both for me and the employer is if the employer needs someone short-term;   One of my more recent consulting gigs, the client was trying to outsource their linux SysAdmin stuff, and they were kissing a lot of frogs.  They needed someone in-house to help meanwhile, but it was clear they were going to drop that position as soon as they found the right foreign contracting company.  It was win-win for me, 'cause I wanted some cash to spend on my own projects, and I didn't harbor bad feelings towards the people who they were trying to get to replace me.    The job lasted longer than expected (oh man, so many frogs!)  but they eventually found a company out of mexico that was pretty good, and told me thanks.<p>I mean, there is certainly room for both in the marketplace.   for some roles, you really want someone who will stick with your company through thick and thin.   But those same people generally do badly in roles like the above where you are essentially asking someone to help you fire them, or where it's glaringly obvious that the job will end shortly.<p>>1]: <a href=""http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdixon.org/2009/10/23/twelve-months-notice/</a><p>Personally, I disagree with Cdixon there;   I think a loyal employee is far more likely to sue an employer if things go south than a mercenary.  I just want to get paid;   There's rarely more than a months worth of compensation on the table, and that's not a lot of lawyer time.  By becoming a contractor, we give up almost all the rights normal employees have.  Contractors, especially direct contractors are often in a better position to cause legal trouble than employees;  the IRS is very liberal in what it defines as an employee, and very conservative in what it defines as a contractor.  As a contractor, you don't threaten to sue just like you don't threaten to bring a gun to work and start shooting.<p>But employees?   It seems like one out of five employees who expected loyalty seem to think they have some sort of discrimination lawsuit even when they get the sweet, sweet first round of layoffs;  the one with the nice severance packages.<p>Mercenaries also operate on trust.   How do you think I'd get my next gig if I sued the last guy?  Trust and reputation are essential to getting new gigs.   If you want to be literal about the mercenary bit, you aren't going to hire me if you think that I'm going to come back and sack your city after I've done the bit you've hired me for.<p>I'd argue that a reputation for being litigious is almost a 'never work again' thing for a contractor, and we know it,  while most employees seem to think they have ""rights"" they can assert without consequence.<p>And really, helping people after the layoffs, I think, is largely a ""how do you want to be perceived""  thing;  I know once I was stepping down my own company and had to get rid of someone.  I ended up switching jobs myself, and recommending my employee to the old employer.  He got the job (and a massive raise over what I paid him)  and the old employer was really happy.  They gave me several other gigs down the line, and the guy who worked for me has recommended other employees to me since then.   Trust and honesty are important on both sides, and when you do need to fire someone, if you can soften the blow, do so.     At smaller companies, it really does make sense to help employees get other jobs;  it usually makes the employee feel better than severance, it's usually cheaper than severance, and you get goodwill from the new employer on top of all that.<p>At larger companies, it seems, giving people some cash and maybe some retraining is probably the best you are going to do, but that's still important.  The people who continue working there don't magically stop talking to the people you fired after the layoffs;  and you are expecting the remaining people to work harder than they were before, so if you don't want your best people to jump ship, you want to make them think that they will be taken care of if they are caught in the next round.   Of course, the deceptive bit of this is that usually by the second or third round, when you are letting your better people go, there isn't enough cash left to give good severance pay.<p>But yeah.  I dono.  It is possible that my attitude makes me a worse leader.  A more honest leader, but maybe worse.  I don't understand it when people give me loyalty.   My employee has worked for me far longer than I expected.  He is currently interviewing at google, and he tells me he feels like he is betraying me.  (google approached him, not the other way around.)   From my point of view, this is just the way things work.  I hire less experienced people, give them some training, and then as they gain experience, they move on to bigger and better things.    At this point, the guy is better than I am in a few areas;  I would have expected him to leave more than a year ago.  Getting mad about someone leaving me for a substantial raise would be about as rational as getting mad at the rain for making my roof leak.  Rain happens;  If the roof leaks, that's on me.",1317585500

3063833,comment,3062900,3063285,8,0,jerf,,,"There is the old saying ""Actions speak louder than words."" But that saying predates mass media, and the existence of schools in which one can learn marketing and political speech as actual formal <i>degrees</i>, and the rise of postmodernism and its ethic of relative truth making it permissible to pretty much say anything in the pursuit of a goal.<p>I would update it as simply ""Actions speak, words don't."" Perhaps somebody can come up with a more pithy version. But it's amazing the amount of BS that you can cut through with this metric, and just how unbelievably worthless the torrent of words coming from our politicians and businesses are. I mean, worthless on a philosophically profound level. Astonishing amounts of effort are burned on ensuring that words are as disconnected from reality as possible.<p>Facebook will say whatever they think will advance their agenda, only very loosely constrained by laws and with many educated people who know exactly how to skirt those laws with precisely-constructed vague statements that sound like one thing but legally say another. (The easiest and most popular are statements carefully qualified to in fact say nothing at all.)

It's worth noting that later chapters have fewer exercises. The one I'm looking forward to most, Chapter 8, has less than a third as many as Chapter 1 does. Presumably they get less mechanical as well. I'd be content if I find enough time to ""pay my dues"" the slow way through the earlier chapters.

3063828,story,,,2,4,zubr1768,"Are online CS degrees taken seriously?",,"I'm a web developer who has been at it for over a decade. I have worked for startups and agencies as programmer and designer of both front and backend solutions, and have been maintaining a freelance business for about 7 years now. I have three BA degrees in humanities, including one in Music and another in Fine Art. I've never had a problem finding web-related work. Web development has given me the flexibility in life to pursue a variety of things, eventually to realize, happily, that doing this is actually my primary passion. However, I continuously see more job adverts - oftentimes the more interesting ones - requesting a BS in CS.<p>I respect this and can understand why a company would prefer a credentialed candidate for a job. At this point I would enjoy the process of working through a CS degree - there are some holes in my learning, especially in mathematics, that I would like to shore up, and I think that approaching a CS degree with my experience in tow would yield good results on many levels, as there is so much that I could learn and apply what I already know to. But at this point I don't want to spend the money, and living in a college atmosphere doesn't appeal to me either. All of what I currently know about programming I've gleaned from the web and on-the-job research. But now I'm wanting to push myself to a higher level; not necessarily only into a management position, but more as a person capable of executing great ideas.<p>I've seen a growing proliferation of online CS and IT degrees available from places like Western Governors. They can be completed from home and at a fraction of the cost of a regular 4-year university. Now I know that the education quality couldn't possibly be as good as what one might get at a place like Stanford (or?). But if I were to do this, it would be primarily as a means to an end.<p>What do you guys think - is it worthwhile wrt getting a great job (or better yet, to becoming a great programmer) to pursue a software development-related BS degree from an online university, or just a waste of time for someone who has been working in the field for a while already? I already have a hunch that it might be better to simply cherry-pick a few math courses at a local university or community college, and ""follow my muse"" along with my budget.<p>Would like to hear from anyone who has done it, or who differentiates between programmers at an HR level. Thanks.",1317585361

It looks like we already do subsidize risk takers.<p>> the argument we're having really hinges on the definition of concepts like 'fairness' and 'justice' (...) progressive taxation is repugnant because it's neither fair nor just.

If it costs a minimum of $10,000 a year to clothe and feed yourself, a 10% flat tax is going to affect someone who is poor a lot more than it is going to affect someone who isn't.<p>This is what is unfair.<p>> the way people actually behave makes me think diminishing marginal utility of income is completely questionable<p>You've yet to present an argument against this idea.

3063819,comment,3060105,3062102,8,0,Anechoic,,,"> <i>I find this hard to accept.</i><p>As did I at first, but it's true. There are several papers that show the math behind this (including one I co-authored called ""Performance of ballast mats on passenger railroads: Measurement vs. projections"") - unfortunately they are all behind paywalls.<p>> <i>Just because there's a spring doesn't mean the weight isn't there, bearing down on the wheels, deforming the wheel and the track.</i><p>At rest, sure. Once it's in motion, the static load is insignificant (by several orders of magnitude) compared to the dynamic forces, and the dynamic forces are driven by the unsprung mass (and other factors such as the primary suspension frequency).<p>><i>Stand next to a train as it goes by, you can feel the ground move.</i><p>You're referring to ground-borne vibration (one of my areas of expertise). Again, that is a function of the dynamic forces, not the static forces. The FTA <i>Transit Noise & Vibration Impact Assessment</i> guidance manual (disclosure: I used to work for the firm that wrote the manual and I have a contract with FTA to teach cources based on material in the manual) touches upon this a little bit when it mentions that heavy rail and light rail trains have similar vibration levels (p 7-8, section 7.3, note that ""heavy"" and ""light"" in this context refers to train schedule not vehicle weight, but generally speaking heavy rail vehicles tend to be heavier than light rail vehicles) but again, all the good stuff is behind paywalls.<p>><i>All that bending/unbending of the track and bed contributes to fatigue damage, and fatigue damage goes up as the cube of the load.</i><p>That's a highway stat. Trains are different than roadway vehicles in that there is only one spring separating the vehicle weight from the unsprung mass. In trains, there are two suspension systems, the primary suspension with isolates the wheel/axle from the truck and the secondary suspension that isolates the vehicle body from the truck (and the wheels). When you look at the driving force behind ground vibration, the body weight has little correlation with the forces going into the ground (okay, there is a weak correlation in that heavier trains tend to have heftier axle sets, but the differences here between, say, the Acela and the TGV are minor).",1317585205

A lot of accountants make a glorious, tragic mess of Excel. I've seen it -- over and over and over, again.

3063727,comment,3063167,3063167,9,0,onetimer,,,"I am impressed by Michael's willingness to talk about his personal experience with bipolar disorder. People don't realize how prevalent it is, as those affected are often too embarrassed by past behaviors from when manic, too unsure when depressed, or rightfully concerned about the stigma from outing themselves to want to share their experiences with others. That's why you don't know how many of your acquaintances have it and that's why the stigma persists.<p>So kudos to Michael for sharing.<p>Michael's piece reads like many others I've read on reddit's bipolarreddit subreddit. A 20 something self-diagnoses themselves with bipolar II and lets the world in on their ability to self-control the disorder without medicine (in many posters' cases, without a medical support team).<p>In most cases I'm glad for them, and the provided advice is usually what any book on bipolar will tell you to change about your lifestyle. Sleep 8 hours, cut out stimulants, cut out inebriates, exercise and meditate.<p>My concern is that the subtler message of ""just overcome your brain disorders with pure will power"" might mislead readers to dismiss medication as one-size-fits-all tranquilizers/stimulants and provide their fragile egos one more reason not to seek help from a health care professional.<p>When I encounter clearly manic or psychotic individuals online I reach out, gently. I've made friends on TF2, Reddit and via YouTube. I've watched helplessly as many who categorically eschewed all medical assistance eventually slipped into psychotic states, evidenced by incoherent, often angry messages about their delusions in my inbox. It's not always fun reaching out but in a number of cases you can get the message across early enough and they successfully get help.<p>I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder a couple of years ago and worked with a doctor to find a combination of low-dose medications that has squashed any sort of noticeable irrational moods without any noticeable side effects. It took nearly a year of experimentation to find the right combination. It's frustrating, especially on the downswings, but worth it in hindsight.<p>Thanks Michael for the interesting piece and if Michael's story resonates with you, consider investing in a visit to an experienced provider. Be patient.<p>And if you have experiences with bipolar disorder I urge you to suppress your ego and share them. Only with widespread sharing can the stigma be quashed, and people will be more comfortable seeking treatment early.",1317583431

It's the parents that push their kids to be measurably good at all the things they've been told geniuses are good at. It's the students who go to university because that's how they're told they will get good jobs, and not due to a thirst for learning. It's the managers that try to create a workplace that has some superificial resemblance to another place that has turned out great work, and then expect that they've flipped on the genius switch.<p>We're so used to measuring and planning everything, that when we decide we want 'genius' all we think to do is measure what we can in other instances, and force that to happen. I suspect it's very hard for a lot of people to believe that (a) it takes all kinds of un-measured hard work, (b) there are so many more aspects than they can think of that go into creating genius, and (c) there's a measure of luck to it and they can't control everything.<p>Back to the topic of the article though, I see parents who believe there is a causal link from Good School --> 'Good Job', and see a link to Good School from all these things 'geniuses have been known to do.'",1317583201

Show me these cases.<p>Anyone putting their time and/or money to work on a risky enterprise where the expected value is negative - which includes most startup founders and angel investors.<p>What we do for a living doesn't seem rational - typically, we get back far less than what we put in, especially if you consider opportunity costs. But yet we still do it.<p>Why do we do this? Entrepreneurs don't strike me as irrational - as a group, I'd consider us more rational than average. Instead of dismissing risk-takers as nuts, you should listen to what our behavior is loudly telling you - our utility curve isn't concave, it's convex.  Risk-taking behavior in the face of negative odds <i>only</i> makes economic sense if marginal utility of income <i>increases</i>, not decreases, with income.<p>You know, it's not only entrepreneurs whose actions shout ""hey, diminishing marginal utility of income isn't valid.""  Anyone who buys a lottery ticket does it too.  People aren't stupid. Everyone knows they're on average only getting back a fraction of the money they put into a lottery. What their actions actually tell you is ""hey, I value the incredibly small chance of getting rich so highly that I'm happily taking what would otherwise be considered a sucker's bet.""<p>If you really want to maximize utility in the tax code, you'd have to have all of those who behave in risk-adverse ways (with concave utility curves) subsidizing all of those who behave in risk-loving way (with convex utility curves).  Which goes a fair bit beyond 'tax deductions'.<p>Honestly, the way people actually behave makes me think diminishing marginal utility of income is completely questionable - instead, many of us believe and behave like there's an increasing marginal utility of income.<p>But enough about economics - the argument we're having really hinges on the definition of concepts like 'fairness' and 'justice', which is what you should've started with, not some utility curve argument that's only tangentially relevant.  No matter what the utility curve looks like, progressive taxation is repugnant because it's neither fair nor just. It clearly violates the principle of equality before the law - even though all men are created equal, progressive taxation makes the property rights of the wealthy less important than the property rights of the poor. If taxes are a necessary evil, and I suspect they are, they should be proportional, not progressive.",1317582773

[...] ^And, yes, I'll say it... Government.<p>I like the sentiment of your comment and 100% agree about doing good deeds on an individual and business level. Unfortunately, the point about doing nice things doesn't always scale to a governmental level.<p>History backs this up quite clearly - when you capitulate even a little bit to demands due to unrest, you almost always get more unrest within 5 years. It's how the British Empire lost the 13 Colonies.<p>See, legitimate grievances do have to be addressed, but unfortunately addressing them in response to protest creates hugely empowered people fundamentally hostile to the government that capitulated. These people's power stems from their ability to extract concessions under rebellion or threat of rebellion, so, humans being what they are, they'll inevitably rebel or threaten to rebel after a short honeymoon period.<p>The solution is pretty clear in the history books - crack down brutally on the leadership, wait a suitably short amount of them, and <i>then and only then</i> redress grievances. That way, the people who are actually suffering have their needs fulfilled, but you don't have a class of organizers feeding and fueling further unrest and riots.<p>That particular policy has worked consistently throughout history. Crack down, <i>then</i> redress grievances and help the people. There's notable examples it working effectively across all eras and continents. Redressing and hoping that rioters are satisfied and don't continue without the crackdown doesn't work. Neither does cracking down without fixing problems.<p>This doesn't make the position ethical, moral, aesthetic, or what should be done. But it does seem to be the best way to fix problems without setting off a cascading cycle of violence and revolution.",1317582403

- todo lists
- self discipline
- sports
- stopping drugs / coffee / alcohol<p>I'm kind of ""scared"" of these things now, but also realize that they are, while not the complete solution, necessary ingredients to living a ""normal"" life. It took me 28 years to realize that you could have a regular sleep schedule and daily routine for example. It's these kind of ""symptoms"" that I find very hard to share with ""normal"" people, who just can't see how that is that big of a problem.<p>The funny thing is that all of this further fueled my mania, but on the other hand, it also made me check in with a psychiatrist. I'm now on lamotrigine, which makes living seem so easy now.<p>Yet I can skip a day of pills, and drink maybe a bit too much coffee and sleep badly, and it's all there again. Only now I have a baseline I can come back to. I don't think the article sounds too manic.

By it's very nature, the 3 step process leads to good code.  The problem is when people start to skip that ever important 3rd step.<p>Countless times I've seen so called TDD evolve into merely writing a test, and then writing the code to pass the test, and then ignoring the 3rd step of the process.<p>Regardless, you are misrepresenting what is being said:<p>> it is not a silver bullet that will 'in concert with other stuff' always lead to good design.<p>And no one is suggesting that.  You are inferring it.  You are being religious in your dislike of TDD zealotry to the point that you are assuming that suggesting that TDD drives good design means using TDD ""with other stuff"" always leads to good design.<p>Rather, TDD drives good design means simply that by properly practicing TDD, you are more likely to result in good design precisely because of how TDD works.  That doesn't mean you can't sabotage yourself along the way.  However, what I've found is that bad design from TDD is generally more difficult to achieve.  If you are finding tests difficult to write, your generally going to find your design is bad.  I see this all the time, from programmers who are really smart.  We'd prefer to believe in our own brilliance then admit we were proven wrong by a mere methodology.<p>Side note: Their is a lot of zealotry in this thread.  It's mostly those against TDD (you'll notice they use the word religious a lot).  I'll admit that some can make the troubling leap that TDD is a silver bullet.  But, if your instinct is to argue against TDD by claiming it's not a silver bullet, you're not any better.  More importantly, why does TDD need to be a silver bullet for it to be worth while?

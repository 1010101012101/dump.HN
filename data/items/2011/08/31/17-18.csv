So, you're happy with single-core boxes then, I take it?<p>Actually, you're regressing to even before that, when there was no pre-emptive multitasking. When the program is done doing something, it yields control to some other task.<p>Also, I'd like to point out that just because you aren't explicitly doing I/O doesn't mean that you aren't doing I/O. The OS might have paged out some stale data (quite likely, since you aren't managing I/O yourself), and you might be holding the giant lock while it's paging it in.<p>""I can't speak to all systems like this, but the Prevayler approach is pretty straightforward.""<p>I just want to clarify: so when you encounter a problem, you do some rollback, which automatically moves the state to the last snapshot and rolls forward to the previous transaction, right? No manual steps?<p>I hope you have a recent snapshot or that will be a long wait (while holding the big lock, I might add).",1314813506

2946691,comment,2945513,2946351,2,0,wpietri,,,"Like you, I believe in the right tool for the job. For many applications, an SQL server is awesome.<p>I'm sure the developer community for MS SQL Server is reasonably large, but it is much, much smaller than the Ruby community or the Java community. The same is true for library code for each environment.<p>I think the Facebook example cuts the other way. If they had implemented all their core application logic in MS SQL Server, they would have been well and truly screwed if the performance wasn't enough. With PHP, at least they could write their own compiler; trying to reverse-engineer MS SQL Server is orders of magnitude harder.<p>Regarding the ""volumes of data being passed around"" part, that works well with a hot-in-RAM system; no data is passed anywhere. As with doing it all in stored procedures, no data leaves the server.<p>I do agree that a lot of people don't get full value out of their database. Sometimes that's a very reasonable business choice: vendor lock-in is extremely expensive at scale. But it does often come from ignorance. On the other hand, almost every developer has written a few database-backed applications, but very few have written anything in the NoDB style. Many can't even conceive of coding something without a database. I'd love to see both sorts of ignorance reduced.",1314813340

2946688,comment,2945419,2946508,1,0,tedkimble,,,"Thanks for the nice counter-argument. I think you're probably right in practice.<p>My opinion stems from two things. First, HMTL and CSS are trivially easy for me and consume only a small fraction of time I spend on the design process. I imagine this applies to almost all of those who share the opinion that you must know HMTL and CSS to be a web designer. You make a strong argument that this is not a necessity to being a top-notch designer.<p>But where my passion in this debate really stems from is my recent experience completing a graduate program in architecture. We were mentored to experiment with our medium; to uncover the materials' latent properties and capabilities, incorporating a bottom-up design process. This was (and is) highly unusual and controversial. Opposed to this is a purely top-down process, subject to the whims and inspirations of a single designer. The idea and form come first, and they are then imposed on an inert medium.<p>I see parallels to web design. Photoshop enables top-down thinking. The web (through HTML and CSS) are inert -- they are at the will of whatever form Photoshop demands. But I see something different in the code. I see a rich source of inspiration. I see capabilities, limitations, and tendencies. I see a ""charged"" source of untapped potential.<p>It's true, there are many valid sources of inspiration outside of code. Most of them, actually. But if no designers looked to HMTL and CSS for inspiration, I think a lot of potential would be lost.",1314813284

Same with other expensive optimizations. This is something that all JITs out there do -- you start with simple interpretation (or extremely cheap compilation, in the case of V8), and then when you detect that you're spending a whole lot of time in one section of code, you replace it with a highly optimized version.<p>Type inference is not that expensive compared to several more interesting optimizations done on several JITs that are in production systems. In some long running JITs, the compilation of some hot loops takes far longer than static compilations, running in a low priority thread in the background (while the less optimized code keeps going in the foreground).<p>Finally, if anything, JITs allow <i>more</i> time to run heavy optimizations because they can leave those running in the background without affecting the use of the program or hurting developer productivity.<p><i>> JS's semantics require that ints overflow into doubles, for example</i><p>On recent x86 processors, you would just use doubles in most cases. It turns out that they're on par with integers for speed, although I believe there were some differences on latency. I'd have to look back at the Intel opt manual to confirm, though. However, if you really want to solve the issue (say, on ARM where integer/float performance actually matters -- especially since lots of architectures are still on softfloat), then you'd use a combination of guards, versioning, and VRP to solve the issue, not type inference.<p><i>> Finally, the presence of eval() and the like mean that almost no inference can be totally sound, requiring even more dynamic checks.</i><p>Yep, eval is a terrible language feature if you care about making things fast. Regardless of whether you have type inference or not.",1314812768

Still all projects are always reviewed by a 'construction engineer' who converts the architectural vision to workable implementation (that is then on passed to production teams).

At best, you write your own basic DB, because you don't need anything fancy.<p>For example, you write S-expressions to files like Hacker News does.  This is clever, because the file system has some of the features of a database system, and files and S-expressions are abstractions that already exist.  You do have to manage what data is in memory and what data is on disk at any given time, but the complexity and amount of code are low.<p>The idea that ""event sourcing"" somehow keeps you from needing a DB is ridiculous.  By the time you've defined the event format, and written the software to replay the logs, etc., which if you're smart will be fairly general and modular, congrats, you've just written a database.  At best, you keep complexity low, and it's another example of a small custom DB for a case where you don't need a fancy off-the-shelf DB.  Maybe it's the perfect solution for your app, but it's still a database.<p>""Memory images,"" as a completely separate matter, are an abstraction that saves you some of the work of making a DB.  Just as S-expressions can save you from defining a data model format, and files can save you from a custom key-value store, memory images as in Smalltalk could save you from having to deal with persistence.  And if your language has transactions built in, maybe that saves you from writing your own transaction system.  In general, though, it's very hard to get the DB to disappear, as there is a constellation of features important to data integrity that you need one way or another.  It's usually pretty clear that you're using a DB, writing a DB, or using a system that already has a DB built in.  If you think there's no DB, there's a high chance you're writing one.  Again, that could be fine if you don't need all the features and properties of a robust general-purpose DB.<p>Funnily enough, in EtherPad's case, we had full versioned history of documents, and did pretty much everything in RAM and application logic -- a pretty good example of what the article is talking about -- and yet we used MySQL as a ""dumb"" back-end datastore for persistence.  Believe me, we tried not to; we spent weeks trying alternatives, and trying to write alternatives.  Perhaps if every last aspect of the data model had been event-based, we could have just logged the events to a text file and avoided SQL.  More likely, I think, we would use something like Redis now.",1314811495

You certainly can sacrifice all those things, but most people will never amass $40m no matter what they sacrifice. Better to find something (and someone) that you love, work hard at it, and enjoy life. Yes, you should take chances, yes you should push yourself and be ambitious.

Big picture strategy, overall user experience, effective use of visual language, and a litany of other things are complex areas deserving the attention of the designer.<p>We hire smart people to think about design, and other smart people to worry about code. This works very well.<p>Some purists believe you need to distill a pursuit down to its base elements, in order to consider yourself a master. While I appreciate the noble sentiment behind such notions, I believe it to be flawed. For example, I knew one fellow in art school who insisted on grinding down pigment and making his own paint before he'd touch brush to canvas. The unfortunate part for him, was that all the time he put into this kept him from doing the important part: making great paintings.<p>A good interaction designer needs to understand the limitations and possibilities of code. They don't need to be a master of it, so long as they work with someone who does.<p>A reasonable comparison would be Peter Jackson.

My hunch is that if he were to stitch together each garment for the film, he'd never finish a production.<p>The irony in my arguments is that they are, in ways, as impassioned as Andy's.

As per data compiled by the reputable OpenSecrets, of the top contributing organizations from 1989-2010, most of them donate strongly to Democratic candidates (this I assume would be the amounts used to ""bribe"" politicians).[1] Regardless of this fact, I still don't see an analogy between a flip-flop vote (I don't know the vote numbers, so that phrasing might not be true) on TARP by the Republicans (while I don't know numbers, as I recall, the Democrats also voted heavily against a ""bailout"" package before voting for it) and the way that AT&T might use political clout to push through this merger.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php</a><p>EDIT: Interesting to note, however, that AT&T is third on the list of all time donors and on the fence for Dem/Rep support.

2946468,comment,2945185,2945264,1,0,easp,,,"I think people are too quick to throw out Apache + mod_php.  It remains the defacto deployment environment for most open source PHP apps, which means that it is the best understood and best supported.  For example, if you deploy using Apache, you don't have to worry about converting .htaccess rules that wordpress and some caching plugins create into an Nginx equivalent.<p>People bitch a lot about the memory consumption of apache, but it's often overstated.  They add up the resident set for each individual apache process and come up with a huge number, missing the fact that a significant amount is actually shared between processes.<p>Apache's memory consumption problems have more to do with how it handles clients.  Each client ties up a worker process for the entire duration of a request, or beyond if keepalives are enabled (as they should be). That means that the memory overhead of the PHP interpreter is locked up doing nothing after the page is generated while it's being fed to the client.  Even worse, that overhead is incurred while transmitting a static file.<p>I use nginx as a reverse proxy to Apache. It lets me deploy PHP apps easily and efficiently.  Apache returns the dynamic and static requests as quickly as it can and moves on to the next request.  Nginx buffers the result from apache and efficiently manages returning the data to all the clients.  I used to have Nginx serve the static files directly, which is more efficient, but added complexity to my config.  I chose simplicity.<p>A PHP opcode cache, like APC, is also a big win, because it cuts the overhead of parsing and loading the PHP source files.  I'm not convinced of the value of other caching for most uses. CPU time usually isn't the scarce resource, RAM is.  The DB and filesystem cache are already trying to keep needed data in RAM.  Adding more caching layers generally means more copies of the same data in different forms, which means less of the underlying data fits in RAM.",1314810655

Clojure has Leiningen, which is much better to work with, but its library space is mixed in quality and its java interface is still worse than Scala's (and going back from Java to Clojure? Getting better, still  harder). Lisp still sings to me, but when you're working with a lot of Java libraries, your freedom to really leverage lisp is blocked somewhat.<p>So I dunno how I'd come down, now. I like both, I dislike both. Probably depends on my mood that day. I do think that _both_ of those two languages stands pre-eminent for the kinds of systems and platform work I do.

2946443,comment,2943950,2945973,3,0,Symmetry,,,"The difference is that frequentist practice would be to stop at the 95% confidence interval and leave it there, whereas a Bayesian would use that observation to update their probability estimate of the theory being true.<p>""If the Higgs were at 140 GeV, it would have 5% probability of producing the results we measured experimentally"" is the same as\n  P(Observation | Higgs at 140Gev) = .05<p>So we can say that<p><pre><code>  P(Higgs|Observation) = P(Observation|Higgs) * P(Higgs)\n                         -------------------------------\n                         P(Observation)\n</code></pre>\nSo given that getting your new belief about the probability of a Higgs Boson at some energy is going to be updated based on your observation, you can see that it ends up being scaled by that exact confidence result.  That's sort of an oversimplification, since really you end up calculating the P(O) scaling factor based on P(O|H) among other things, but I hope you can see how they're closely related in practice.",1314810308

It was wrong, it did not work well, it simply wasn't even considered in the design.<p>Now, each set of spaces is segregated by monitor, instead of every set being paired. If you're actually trying to manage lots of simultaneous tasks on multiple monitors, this state of affairs is radically better (and is the default for many Linux window managers, which have long ago addressed and solved multi-monitor problems because their user constituency   is full of people in that space). In this regard, Lion is much better than Snow Leopard.",1314810243

There's an open feature request for it, but no activity on it.<p>Flash is unfortunately still a requirement for a lot of websites. The 32bit binary chrome has flash bundled, so updates are received as quickly as possible (I know, I should run some flash-blocking plugin, but I don't right now).  On 64bit Linux (which is what I need most of the time), you have to maintain the flash plugin separately, and run it through nspluginwrapper, which makes it much less stable in my experience.<p>You used to be able to run the 32 bit debs on 64bit Ubuntu, but that broke a couple versions ago, and I never had time to see if it could be fixed. You also lose the package manager updates when you do this, since apt isn't multi-arch aware.",1314810191

Where does your list of genres come from?  Is that all the genres available from soundcloud?  I ask because it's relatively general.  For example, check out this list of subgenres of electronic music:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/czhzq/official_list_of_electronic_music_related/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/electronicmusic/comments/czhzq/offic...</a><p>And even that is out of date and doesn't include things like complextro (<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/complextro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/complextro</a>).<p>2.  Can you make it so that when you click the name of the currently playing song, it takes you to its SoundCloud homepage instead of the pure SC flash player playing that song?  Would be nice to favorite it on SC and dl it if possible.<p>3.  had another but forgot, will add it if I remember it...",1314810138

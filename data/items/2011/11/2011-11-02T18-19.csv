3188386,comment,3180369,3185105,1,0,jtprince,,,"I'm not arguing that everyone using python for science should come running in hordes to sciruby.  What I'm saying is that if you prefer ruby to python that this is helping to make it possible to do a lot of science all in ruby.  Also, some of the nuances of ruby <i>could</i> make for some interesting science code.<p>1. (reply) I know it is possible, however, in practice it is easier and done more often in ruby.  The idea permeates ruby thinking much more than in python.  Even 'if' statements return a value, and rubyists often use that.<p>2. (reply) yeah, list comprehensions are cool, wish ruby had 'em.  The original point was more directed to R and matlab code.  Still, the way in which enumeration is done in ruby looks and feels quite different than python, even if the same effect is achieved.  [1,2,3].each_cons(2).map {|x| x + 3}<p>3. (reply) True, but if ruby hadn't persisted alongside python, would django exist?  sciruby may do things differently than scipy, and that just might make python/scipy better down the road.<p>4. (reply) To be clear, I have the utmost respect for the python community.  How about saying that they innovate in different ways?  Python's emphasis on having one preferable way of doing things tends to yield well engineered systems, and innovation occurs easily in layers as a result.  Because of ruby's flexibility, Rubyists are more prone to rebuild core functionality in different ways.  Depending on how much you care about syntax, that's either a colossal waste of time or quite useful.<p>Finally, if you don't care about the syntax of scientific computation, then yes, this only allows rubyists to do computation in ruby.  But, despite their many similarities, ruby and python are fundamentally different in several ways.  To suggest that we might be able to do scientific computing in somewhat new and interesting ways is not meant to be insulting to python developers, and we make the claim with the deepest sincerity, and humility.  Like python, ruby possesses unique strengths, and we hope to bring these to bear on scientific computing as best we are able.",1320260367

He was never really an engineer.<p>And I agree with him: many tech-oriented sites tend to think the only jobs that (should) exist end in ""Science"" or ""Engineering"". Does the entertainment industry not fuel economic growth? Would Netflix be popular if we didn't have movies and television shows to stream? Would smartphones be pushing the envelope if all they did was allow you to check your email and take calls? Do we not laud video games that have fantastic stories and artwork?<p>I've even seen commenters express superiority between the science degrees. For instance, ""<i>Computer Science</i> isn't really a science. It's just math!"" and, ""You can't call yourself a <i>software engineer!</i> Real engineers get qualifications! Real engineers do something that can affect public safety!"" are both common sentiments.<p>Why is this?

One is an administrative cookbook, and the other is a high-performance guide.  Definitely worth reading (and re-reading).<p>I'm in Israel, where MySQL is the open-source database king, and where people have barely heard of PostgreSQL.

We had a great product in a nice space and were fairly successful at selling it and making modest profit.<p>But the start was rough.  Unless it's a one-person gig (and there aren't many of those out there) you need two things - bodies and money.  The further you are away from metro areas the harder it is to find both - the people with the skills either left or are already working somewhere and the investors aren't multi-millionaires, they are angels with $10-20k each, sometimes $100k+.<p>It's possible though.  That startup eventually sold but long after a more inferior competitor sold for a lot more which had more to do with their location (Cali, I think in the valley) than how well they functioned.  And the company I was with sold for less than we thought it would and long after the window in which acquisition would have been ideal.<p>There's just no visibility outside of major (tech hub) metro areas.  You don't get any buzz even if you are in magazines and the like, and you don't have the contacts that can really help you out.  It's a major negative.<p>Pure (somewhat educated) conjecture:  if that startup would've been in Seattle or Portland it would've sold much earlier and for much more than it did, maybe in year 6 instead of year 10.

The object either has far too little energy to significantly change its orbit, or alternatively has enough energy but there is nothing moon-like left after that collision.<p>The moon has a mass of 7.34910 kg. Its mean orbital velocity is 1023m/s. So, with a perfectly-aligned impact, and perfect efficiency, to add velocity, you'd need to add energy equal to difference in kinetic energy. For 1m/s, that'd be 10J (assuming the change in mass is negligible). That's an incredible amount of energy, about 20 times greater than the Chicxulub impact (believed to have triggered the mass extinctions at the K-T boundary).<p>That's 1 m/s. You need far more than that. Earth escape velocity is 11200m/s. So, that would seem to need 10 J.  And an impact would deliver that in well under a minute. Which would be a problem, since that's an order of magnitude greater than the gravitational binding energy of the moon.<p>Conclusion: impact required would fully obliterate moon.<p>(Moon mass and velocity, and escape velocity from <a href=""http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html</a>.

Say, pretending like you really need more than that $40,000 job the English major can get that lets him live in a small but safe apartment in a fine neighborhood (that has plumbing, electricity, and sanitation) in a non-center-of-the-world American city, and shop for all the groceries he needs in the market 10 minutes away.<p>Anyway, for a community that loves Steve Jobs so dearly - a man who claims the Mac wouldn't have been so successful if not for that calligraphy class he took at Reed College - there's an awful lot of derision in these comments for non-engineering around here. Of course, this is also a guy that dropped out of school and taught himself technical skills. Just enough to be dangerous... and convince someone like Woz to help him out.

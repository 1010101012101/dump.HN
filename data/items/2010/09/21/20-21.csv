If your means consist of $8 an hour, $320 a week, $1000 a month after taxes, that means buying bulk oatmeal instead of Raisin Bran.  That might mean eating beans and rice instead of stealing steak.<p>Having been a poor, starving college student before, and living off of ramen noodles, mac and cheese, hot dogs, etc, I know this reality.  I wasn't smart enough at the time to realize how unhealthy a lot of cheap food is, and if I had to do it over again I'd eat beans and rice and oatmeal as they're much more healthy.<p>Anyway, the point he's trying to make is that even if you are extremely poor, making $8 an hour, you can choose to live on a budget.  Rent a room somewhere for a few hundred dollars a month, buy cheap food for a hundred bucks a month.  If you're smart and live within your means, you can be saving 10% of your income even with only $1,000 a month.  Work a second job, pick up more income.  Maybe splurge and buy some meat once in a while now that you can afford it.<p>If you're getting a $200 payday loan every week and paying $250 a few days later, you're just plain stupid.  That ends up taking $200 a month out of your money.  And $200 a month can buy a lot of oatmeal...",1285102783

I pulled this out of an email I was sent just yesterday.<p>Sure, I'd be interested in collaborating if there's not one out there already.<p>The spider part is easy, you just need a web client (e.g. Ruby's or Python's Mechanize, Java's HTTPClient, even just wget or curl) coupled with an HTML parser (Hpricot, Nokogiri, Tidy, etc., or even some basic regular expressions).  One can readily hack something rough together in an hour or two. Gabriel might have a lot of the data and certainly the code in order to produce DuckDuckGo, but he may have good reasons to keep that private.<p>The harder part, and the part that I wonder if builtwith is doing correctly, is to do the technology detection.  Things like JavaScript libraries or CSS frameworks might be fairly easy to detect, but it is not trivial to reliably detect some of the server side technologies.  I recently put together a script to survey the operating system and web server in use at a large number of domains from Alexa's top million list (similar to what Netcraft does) and there are plenty of servers that make that difficult, let alone determining whether a site is built with Ruby, Java or PHP.  There are HTTP headers that could tell you, but not everyone uses them. There are certain signatures that give a pretty good clue, but those aren't always present and can be downright misleading.  (I've seen sites that migrated from ASP to Java Servlets, for example, that kept .aspx URLs to avoid breaking links.)<p>If I remember correctly someone posted a JavaScript framework survey based on a similar spidering approach on HN a while back, you might be able to find it at searchyc.",1285102738

One of the most important differences is that my system will not only be available as a cloud service, but companies can run their own server if they want. The server software is extremely simple in this sense: it needs zero configuration, it embeds an open source db engine (Derby) and an open source web server (Jetty). Basically the server just needs to be copied an run and that's all. It is also operating-system independent (provided that a JVM is available).",1285102687

Now the fact that we <i>have</i> ideas is definitely real, in the sense that having a idea is a physical process (some sort of brain chemistry).<p>I know I sound pedantic, but such confusion is the basis of many silly disputes, like the one that's about deciding whether ideas ""out there"" or ""man made"", while it doesn't actually change anything.<p>Now, you keep saying ""property"", but do you really think that any rule we should come up with are closer to physical property than exclusivity or monopoly? Frankly, the only IP rules I can come up with are directly a form of exclusivity or monopoly, and have nothing to do with ownership.<p>Now your question may be hard for you, but for me it's dead easy.  I believe that all software should be free. That patents should be banished (including, if not especially, the pharmaceutical ones).  That copyright length should be reduced down to 10 years tops, and it's scope limited to commercial exploitation.  The only thing I'm not sure yet is whether we should abolish copyright altogether.  Therefore, I believe that you should totally own what you rightfully hold in your hands, even if most its value comes from the idea it represents.  I may make an exception for DVD and such, but when the object can do useful things beyond storing some pre-set data, then you should be allowed to do anything, including publishing the schematics and the firmware.",1285102592

Notice how the college fund comment is plugged into the response as if it is a given! What is the HN opinion on paying for college?<p>Q. Biological Clock vs. Financial Reality: My husband and I have very different views on when we should start trying to conceive. My feeling is there's no time like the present, while he feels that we're not ready yet. We both feel ready emotionally, but we both feel, quite frankly, poor. (We're both graduate students—we make less than 20,000 and after this May have no guaranteed income.) But I'm of the ""simple life"" mind-set anyway. Infants don't need much beyond onesies and diapers; no matter how well-off we are, we wouldn't be doing diaper genies and such. And mostly, I feel, we can always get money, but we can't get these years back. (We're fairly young—in our late 20s—but we want to have lots of kids.) I'm having a really hard time waiting; I break into tears every time I see a baby. We've discussed this ad nauseam. He says it's not just up to me, so we should wait. But it's not just up to him, either. I guess my question comes down to this: Who's the default decider?<p>A: Among the devastation this bad economy is bringing is the situation you are in: People who would otherwise be starting their families are too financially afraid to do so. There's no default decider here—this has to be a decision the two of you make. Your husband is right that having a baby requires more than onesies and love. But you're also right that you can't put this off indefinitely while you wait for the economy to improve. In any case, however bad the economy is now, eventually it will recover—<b>perhaps in time for you to make a dent in a college fund.</b> I think you two should talk to some trusted outsiders about this. Not necessarily a marriage counselor, but maybe some older relatives who started families in the late 1970s or early '80s, when the economy was also in the dumper. Or perhaps you should consult with someone who does long-term financial planning, so that your husband can feel more confident about making the decision that now is the time for you both to start adding future wage earners to the workforce.",1285102480

Especially for first-time offenders, there are people who <i>might</i> be deterred from future offenses by being put on probation, once they've realized that they got caught and had better knock it off, who would instead turn into more hardened criminals if they're put in jail (and, with the current state of U.S. jails, likely end up joining a prison gang). But there are other people who have to physically be restrained from committing more crimes.<p>The current common sentence lengths don't seem that useful to me, though. Sentences like 6-36 months are just about the worst I can think of, keeping someone in jail <i>just</i> long enough to inculcate all the negative effects, while not actually keeping them off the streets that long. It creates this odd revolving-door mentality, where in some communities it's completely common to be in and out of prison, and everyone's got a bunch of criminals in their social circle. Now we could just lock all those same people up for 20+ years and not let them back out of prison to reoffend, but that seems like a problematic solution as well, given the current numbers (you'd have to be prepared to permanently lock up a <i>large</i> proportion of the population).<p>One start might be to start basing policy on empirical data. Can we find patterns in which kinds of policies have deterrent or anti-deterrent effects on which kinds of people?

For example, doing the opposite, releasing people early under various kinds of early-release and parole programs, generally <i>doesn't</i> appear to increase either crime rates or recidivism rates, at least in any studies I can find. And increasing sentence length also rarely has a statistically significant effect on either crime rates or recidivism rates. One alternative that does seem to often have an effect is increasing policing, i.e. increase the probability of being caught rather than the severity of the punishment if caught. (Doubling the sentence length and doubling the being-caught probability each has the same effect on an ""expected years of prison for committing this crime"" computation, but they seem to have different deterrent effects.)",1285101025

There was a conjunction of several changes (particularly hitting AMT, and a significant decline in mortgage interest deduction, and a good chunk of additional one-time ""unearned"" income) that together made it appear that the marginal rate on the income (relative to the previous year) was on the order of 60+%.<p>FWIW, I know that it's a (hideously) complex calculation with many, many factors, and what I was looking at thus wasn't <i>actually</i> the marginal rate as such.

In this experiment we asked black and white Stanford students into our laboratory and gave them, one at a time, a thirty-minute verbal test made up of items from the advanced Graduate Record Examination in literature. Most of these students were sophomores, which meant that the test was particularly hard for them—precisely the feature, we reasoned, that would make this simple testing situation different for our black participants than for our white participants.<p>Right, so the test was in literature and administered verbally.

Then you start combining these movements with commands, repeating these combinations with just a period, recording them in macros with a couple keystrokes, applying them to every selected line with :norm, etc. It's the combination of all these things that makes it go fast.<p>That said, if I've got a long distance to travel and there's no obvious movement command to get me there quickly, I'll still use the mouse occasionally. It does seem to break the flow though.<p>The biggest improvement vim has made to my productivity isn't just the raw speed of editing, it's the fun of editing with it. That keeps me a lot more focused when the work itself gets a little mundane.",1285099491

In general, it seems obviously good for society for a married couple to both work and outsource some of their domestic responsibilities that others can perform more cheaply.

1713902,comment,1712493,1713739,0,0,jedbrown,,,"When I was young (0-2 and 4-7), my family lived in a remote part of Alaska where we needed very little money and correspondingly earned very little money (~$3k/year for a family of 4).  But we lived like kings, with hundreds of square miles for just us, moving around between different cabins my dad and a couple other people had built on a whim (public land, acceptable at the time), fishing and eating wild game as we pleased.  Then we moved to the city because land regulations had changed and so that my younger brother and I would have more contact with people.  I don't view either of these decisions as irresponsible.<p>Pretty much at the worst possible time, shortly after moving, my brother had some serious asthma issues (several emergency room visits), but of course we had no health insurance at that time.  It took several years to recover from that debt despite long hours (e.g. 90+ hour weeks in wildfire) and good budgeting.  Both my parents have Masters degrees and professional jobs now, but these kind of scenarios happen, it's not always laziness or poor fiscal planning.",1285099327

Emotiv's investors seem to like that business model.<p>* Having an open ecosystem around their EEG device would mean that the loss-leader business model doesn't work anymore and their investors are threatening to do ugly things if Emotiv doesn't get it under control.<p>Now, which one is it? ""Hooray, we can build an EEG at a consumer-friendly (for some value of consumer) price""? Or ""We had a broken business model from the start, but we're going to blame our users""?<p>Note that a slightly-expensive special-purpose device gets a significantly higher share of people interested in using it creatively than a tool that has a very obvious recreational and/or professional purpose, and already fulfills this purpose very well, such as a synthesizer keyboard.<p>Trying the game consoles business model on an EEG device is similarly sensible as selling a 300$ CNC lathe that you can only use with bought programs that were written by random other people with more money on their hands.",1285099225

But I have a theory on why some days there isn't much to read and why reddit had great links in 2006.<p>At that time people put the best of their bookmarks on reddit. Later there wasn't  much good content left in the stash.\nIMO link submissions are unlikely to change. No matter what you do.<p>I think one way we can have interesting dialog on the site is by asking really good starting questions. Most questions so far have been about asking for feedback. Which are interesting for the people asking for feedback and the people giving feedback, but not that great for the rest.",1187164691

Except with enough processing power, instead of sharing a simulation, you have it all to yourself -- so you can always be the #1 Most Important Person in the world, if you wish.  Everything will work out the way you want it to, whatever your particular ethos; you'll set things to rights.  AIs will be programmed to seem like fully convincing humans, but secretly they'll be on virtual happy pills so they'll never suffer.\n",1187164507

Do the same for posts. Because it's expensive to calulate these values, I have a cron job that updates the scores every fifteen minutes.",1187163349

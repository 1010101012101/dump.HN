Courier delivers the package after 5pm on Thursday.<p>Because, as you note, everyone has jobs, and if there was no cost to request delivery times, pretty much everyone would request something like &quot;after 5pm&quot;.

The alternative is to &quot;understand&quot; multiplication; but not having done it much, fumble around and be error-prone when solving a more advanced problem actually requires the use of multiplication as part of its solution. It&#x27;s distracting to the thought process and inefficient to have to exert effort to recall &quot;how to multiply&quot; (and possibly &quot;how to add&quot;, but hopefully not &quot;how to count&quot; too...) when one&#x27;s focus should actually be on a higher-level concept.<p>I worked with some first-year CS students and the number of them who had difficulty with a <i>single digit by single digit</i> multiplication (e.g. 7 x 8) makes me think mental arithmetic is one of those skills that really needs to be drilled into heads.

So for food delivery, usually the drivers will not cook the food, but will put together the bag, double check everything, and add in any extras like sauces, utensils, rice, etc. So if the person for Amazon Now is the one putting the order together and double checking it before loading it into their car, I would think that they are more in line with food delivery than UPS drivers.<p>Also something that takes away from how much I would give is that restaurants usually share some of the tips with in store workers who made the food.

It is very different from the style of learning I was accustomed to. The textbooks I had introduced a new topic in some introduction pages, gave practice examples, and then a few pages of exercises of increasing difficulty.<p>In contrast &quot;Integrated Learning 1&quot; by CPM takes a very different approach. It is very much continuous where the &quot;text&quot; of a topic is interwoven with a couple problems to do. Class room exercises and experiments constitute a lot of the main lessons. This is in contrast to Khan Academy where the progression of math knowledge is easily understandable and the step-by-step approach for learning by example and doing is emphasized.<p>I was a bit taken aback by this approach. I can see it possibly working better in a class room setting. However I did most of my learning by reading. I&#x27;m also concerned that this approach will make it more difficult for students to catch up if their previous math education was not great as this continuous flow style doesn&#x27;t lay out which topics to study.<p>I&#x27;m not sure, but I&#x27;m not currently convinced.

You also know that from frame to frame there may be 0 - N entities in the scene but you don&#x27;t want to be constantly allocating, deallocating, and resizing data structures. So you sketch out a reasonable number of entities to support in a scene. You know the data each entity needs to track to participate in the scene and you figure the best way to pack all of that into a struct of arrays so that processing that update is fast and doesn&#x27;t waste a byte of cache.\nYou haven&#x27;t even written a line of code yet.<p>There is a give and take. You have to test out your assumptions and not be afraid to throw away bad code and start again. Once you start down a path you may find that the statistically significant number of accesses for entity data happens for the members related to the physics update. You might choose a different structure to pack that data into apart from the cold data that doesn&#x27;t change much.<p>Much of data-oriented design is like this: save the modelling for documentation and diagrams and things that humans understand. Write the code for the machine since the machine is the platform. You lose mechanical sympathy when you start designing data structures based on intuition.<p>It doesn&#x27;t cost you anything to think about these things. It&#x27;s just engineering.",1443534202

That model is too simplistic and can only be applied to a limited set of problems.<p>Much more interesting is to model actors / components that talk with multiple other actors / components concurrently and whose state and consequently the set of messages it can receive or emit is changing over time, depending on the state of the components it communicates with.<p>In Erlang&#x27;s actor model it&#x27;s not defeatist to say that the set of all possible messages an actor can receive can be as useful as Any or String in the face of an ever changing context, coupled with the fact that actors can expose different interfaces depending on to whom they talk to. Imagine a component that on one side receives signal readings determining if some physical asset is available or not and on the other side it accepts commands for that asset, but only if the asset is determined to be available. And the commands are numbers in a certain range that also varies over time depending on the signal readings.<p>And as a more recent example of where static typing fails are the transducers from Clojure. Same problem, as in ... modeling of state machines.<p>> <i>And Haskell seems to be doing this just fine, by abstracting IO into its own aspect which can either succeed or fail</i><p>If you are talking about the I/O monad, I believe that the I/O monad sucks for doing actual I/O, though it&#x27;s pretty cool for in-memory stuff. This is because it has baked-in the assumption that those operations are synchronous. Ironically it&#x27;s the same big problem when you look at, say, the common Iterable pattern and compare it with monads. And I&#x27;m not up to date with latest developments, but Iteratees also suck.<p>BTW, I&#x27;m a big fan of static typing. I remember a time where I had a hard to reproduce bug that I couldn&#x27;t understand and I fixed it by eliminating the possibility of it happening through the type system, which was sort of a revelation.

F# has powerful tools for that, and make it intuitive and succinct. C# has fewer and less powerful tools, but it&#x27;s still possible (and usually necessary) to use those tools! The equivalence of F# DU&#x27;s are C# class hierarchies, and the equivalent of pattern matching is virtual methods.<p>Inheritance and virtual methods is a really verbose and horrible way of going about it, but it&#x27;s <i>the</i> way of going about it in C#. <i>You have to use classes for the state here</i><p>Since there is a deleted time only useful for the &quot;Deleted&quot; state of the user the user state shouldn&#x27;t be an enum. It&#x27;s one of the pillars of decent OO design: a you don&#x27;t have a field in a type that is only used for some state of the type: that state should then be a subtype.

I would rather my children learn it on a whiteboard than from a workbook, and I think generally the quality of the modern texts is very poor for actually teaching math.<p>I also think the teachers are bemoaning the Common Core much more than they need to. Explicitly teaching the algorithms for mental math is important. Learning how to do the lattice method, even if it&#x27;s not the preferred method for multiplication, is important. I&#x27;ve talked to far too many teachers who have complained unendlingly about the weakness of the standard, and all that the kids are being forced to learn.

Encapsulation back then literally meant keeping the representation of the data close to the code, i.e. in the same class that implemented the interface on the data or a closely-related specialty class. So I would say the author is not incorrect in looking askance at &quot;value objects&quot; that are passed around, from that perspective.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure the perspective is quite as important as it used to be. Modern dynamic languages make it harder to do bad things in memory, and passing value objects around is pretty much the arterial life force of the entire Internet. In any case one thing is sure: the more pieces of code that know the internal structure of a bit of data the more dependencies there are, and the harder the program is to work on. So to the extent you can have that knowledge in one place - the implementation of an interface - you&#x27;re better off.<p>Perhaps more importantly, OO purism just seems a little anachronistic to me today. I think the key things that OO had to teach us have been mostly absorbed, and we&#x27;ve moved on. It&#x27;s still there, but now it&#x27;s part of the fabric of the art and not as obtrusive as it was in the 90&#x27;s.",1443532786

The only real difference I can see is that you can do the first example on your fingers and toes, whereas you&#x27;d have to scratch some tally-marks in the dirt or on paper to do the second if you don&#x27;t know multiplication tables.<p>What I wonder about with these Common Core curricula, is whether students will ever get enough practice working through mathematics operations to really be comfortable with it.  When I was taught math (and it really wasn&#x27;t that long ago), we were never allowed to use calculators, and we did sheet after sheet after sheet of additions, subtractions, multiplications, divisions, polynomial expansions, equation simplifications, etc.  Maybe five or ten minutes, every day; they were probably graded enough to make us do them, but not enough to really matter.  Most of the Common Core style math worksheets I&#x27;ve seen require far too much rewriting the algorithm from mathematical notation into grade-school English to ever allow that kind of repetition.",1443532264

And then because there is no pattern matching, you have to hand-roll your type checks/casts and make sure have that method throw an unconditional exception at the end for literally impossible states. Then if you make a change to this model, i.e. you add a new &quot;SuspendedUser&quot; subclass, you have to make sure you go through the codebase to update all those places you wrote a hand-rolled &quot;pattern match&quot; against that type. Because the compiler won&#x27;t warn you about an unrepresented state on your type checks. And so then you have to make sure the whole project team is aware and you have to make sure new hires are familiar with the patterns being used. So yeah, the problems just snowball and then you wonder why you didn&#x27;t just use a more appropriate language in the first place that has already taken complete care of all these trivial programming issues.",1443531668

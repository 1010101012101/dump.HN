436936,comment,436495,436495,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I have been an ER/Critical Care nurse for the past 15 years. I went to nursing school right out of high school, because it was ""a good steady job and you can help people.""  I administered narcotics to a patient before I could drink legally.<p>I had always wanted to be an engineer, but I believed people that told me I wasn't smart enough.<p>I remember writing QBasic when I was 9 years old.  I begged my father for a modem for our computer for two full years.  And, finally, when I was 14, he got me a 2400 baud Hayes smartmodem.  After weeks of mucking about with the configuration and connection settings, I was at long last able to connect to my first BBS.  I thought I was in heaven.<p>I mucked around a bit on that BBS for an hour or so, only to have my father try and make a phone call while the modem was connected.  That's when it all came crashing down.  He was furious and forbade me from ever using the modem again.  I still don't know why it upset him so much.  I think it had something to do with the movie War Games that had come out a few years earlier.  I think Dad was scared I was going to hack into NORAD or something.<p>So, for years, I gave up on computers.  I'd day-dream about being an engineer, only to have people around me tell me I'd regret it, that I would hate it, that I was too much of a ""people person"" and that my life would be a complete waste if I spent it in front of a computer screen.<p>But, when I was 30, I finally decided to get back in touch with my inner geek.  I went back to school two classes a semester for 5 years.  My work schedule as a nurse constantly changed from nights, to days, to evenings, to weekends, which forced me to go to school online.  I kept plugging away at it and after 5 long years, I finished the engineering program at the University of Maryland this past May.  I still have some General Ed. credits to take, but I finally finished the classes I'd need for their CMIS/software engineering degree.<p>This June I started to pick up web development and Django.  For several months, I thought I really sucked at, and I thought it all might have been a huge mistake, because I could never get things to work right with Django.  It wasn't until 3 months later, when I went to DjangoCon, that I learned that the release of Django that I had been working with for 3 months had been broken in the lead-up to the 1.0 release.<p>Eight weeks ago, I cut down to part-time at work, so I could focus on boot-strapping startups.  If all goes well, I plan to release my first web app in a couple of weeks.  My plan is to keep bootstrapping startup after startup until something takes off.<p>It's been a long, hard road, and I still have a long, long way to go and a lot to learn.  I've thought many times that I wasn't smart enough, or too old.  Things never really go according to plan.  I get discouraged and frustrated a bunch.  But, the only thing that can really stop me from chasing my dreams is my deciding to give them up for dead.",1232128276

436930,comment,436870,436870,0,0,mdasen,,,"Good article.  To add a few things:<p>1. PHP doesn't require routing.  It's done for you by Apache to the PHP file at that location.  Sure, you can go the way of nice frameworks like Cake and add routing for nicer URLs, but it's not <i>required</i>.  PHP has some solution built in.<p>2. Deployment.  The author touched on having to restart when using mod_perl, but it's more than that.  In most cases, uploading files is enough.  That's why it became so popular with shared hosts.  Anyone with a little knowledge could do it without the host having to give them permissions to do stuff.<p>3. PHP was very big on re-use in the large.  Basically, re-use in the large means creating a calendar app.  Re-use in the small is more like creating a framework that makes it easier to create a calendar app (ala Rails/Django).  So, when you're starting up, it makes it easy to show friends something really working fast.  And that builds mindshare that continues on as programmers do more things.<p>4. Loose typing.  This is probably one of the huge ones.  Many languages are dynamically typed, but if you're developing in Python or Ruby, you have to cast between types.  PHP says, ""don't worry, I know what you mean!""  I'm personally not a fan of loose typing, but I can understand why it helps PHP gain followers (esp those new at programming).<p>However, I kinda disagree with the author's thesis.  The author argues that PHP's community backs the language so well.  I'm less inclined to agree with that.  During the day, I'm often working on PHP stuff and I'm constantly finding the code already written to be sub-par.  Part of that is that PHP is accessible enough for those who don't understand program design to convince themselves that they're a good programmer.  And so many things written in PHP might be from people who wouldn't be able to answer ""what's the difference between a binary search tree and a linked list and give an example when you would use each.""  Not that data structures are the only thing to judge a programmer by, but you get a lot of people in the PHP world that use the guess and check method.  So, the community isn't worth as much to me because I don't have such faith in their code (while I find the Python modules I look at to be of good quality).<p>PHP will continue to be a dominant web language because it's easy to pick up.  However, I guess I'm looking for something else.",1232128153

436919,comment,436331,436672,0,0,unalone,,,"I disagree with that threshold. When I was younger I thought it made sense: I was put into gifted and talented, and I developed an insane elitism that I used to denounce pretty much everybody around me for not having the same intellect. As I got older, I realized: it's not like that. People are <i>very</i> rarely stupid. Most people are very bright and just don't care to apply themselves.<p>Again and again, as a kid, I'd come across situations with bullies and go with the lie that the bullies were stupid and jealous. Then in high school, I'd realize that some of those bullies were very bright, clever, and talkative, and that my own actions towards other kids could be perceived as bullying, when to me it was more a good-natured hazing. I started to realize that even the stoner deadheads that I thought were entirely mindless were in fact intelligent people who knew they were ruining their lives and just didn't care.<p>From the people I've seen, the idea of exclusive intelligence is not as true as most people think it is. I've met people with higher IQs than me who seem less intelligent than I am, because they weren't raised in the way I was, and so went around laboriously working on schoolwork without ever once finding their own interests. For me, that was the height of unintelligence: doing things without asking why. On the other hand, I know one or two people I used to think were stupid going out and doing some pretty impressive things, not because they were particularly bright, but because they kept at something longer than other people did.<p>The line about genius being 99% perspiration keeps coming up in my mind during this conversation. Most people have good ideas: one statement I read says everybody has three million-dollar ideas every year. We've all thought of cool things and then seen somebody else making a fortune of that cool thing. The difference between that person and the rest of the people with that idea is that that person knew what to do with his idea. The idea itself wasn't uncommon, but its <i>realization</i> was.<p>Most people don't do great things because most people don't <i>care</i> to do great things. They never try once.

Republicans like giving businesses new ways to make money.  Subprime loans allowed businesses to lend to a whole group of people they couldn't lend to before.  Democrats like giving poorer people the opportunity to build wealth.  VPs at banks want to move up and proposing a whole new business area gets noticed and promoted.  So, you use overly optimistic calculations that show only good coming from them and lots of people jump on the bandwagon and years later you're in trouble because reality never works as cleanly as paper.  No one had done it before and they didn't know what would happen.  I'm sure if you took foreclosure rates from standard loans and applied them to these subprime ones, the situation looks fine.

This is one of the advantages of going to see a naturopathic doctor in addition to an allopathic doctor. They will actually sit down with you for a 45 minutes and discuss your health, diet, exercise, etc. This would be unthinkable for 99% of normal doctors. While it's true that allopathic doctors should be trained to take your diet and such into account when trying to figure out how to cure you, the fact is that none do. So you could have depression that's caused by a lack of magnesium and your doctor will give your powerful SSRIs, when in reality it could just as easily be cured with a little guacamole. A lot of people will quibble because the example I just gave falls under the myth of what doctors are supposed to do, but if you look at what doctors actually do do then it becomes clear that allopathic medicine is a disaster.

Seriously, just forget any of these artificial groups of friends. I know that's not actually possible but in general don't worry about it. When I look back at the stratification of my high school social order it seems like it was straight out of ""lord of the flies"". Interact with the people who are doing interesting things. People who you find interesting or enjoy spending time with. Don't join any friend groups, that's an entirely isolating situation. Right now you can freely ""group"" with whoever you want.<p><i>Everyone has told me to wait until college, and then I will find new people, but everyone I know in college generally sticks with the same friend group that they had in high school (hence why I would know), so I don't have much hope in that.</i><p>Don't go to college where everyone else is going to college. Get away from all this. I did, and it was one of the best decisions I made when I was a teenager.

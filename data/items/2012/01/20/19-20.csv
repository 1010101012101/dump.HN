3490970,comment,3490365,3490365,1,0,newbusox,,,"In my mind, an underlying problem hindering any bill that purports to enforce IP rights on the internet is the judiciary. Almost be definition, laws such as SOPA/PIPA and whatever else will be evaluated by judges, therefore changing (or, rather, more precisely defining) terms within the law. The vagueness and ambiguity within SOPA and PIPA was the big problem. But until our judges (and, frankly, lawyers) understand the ramifications that poorly reasoned decisions could have on the internet as a whole, this problem will continue, likely regardless of how tightly drafted the bill is. We have a separate bar, and mostly separate courts, for many IP law issues, so a focus should be placed on educating judges and lawyers in this realm--or maybe even creating a new court system for these issues specifically.<p>If our elected officials don't understand these laws, there is little hope that (often) elderly judges will be able to not only understand them, but interpret them in such a way that they effect their narrow purpose.",1327089558

When I'm on OS X, I wish I'd work on Linux.<p>OS X just works and all that, but it is a constrained environment that lacks the Debian repository. MacPorts is painful as hell, it broke my installed packages twice and the last thing you ever want to do is to upgrade all installed packages (because, you know, you might fear security risks). It also installs its own replacements for whatever OS X ships with, being its own little bubble, which drives me insane.<p>And what's the fix for MacPorts? That's right, Homebrew, which is a bunch of scripts that compiles your packages (again) from source and you end up praying to God that the software you want is available, that it takes care of all dependencies and that it compiles until the end, as you've got no idea what to do otherwise. Like it's freaking 1996.<p>So you know, now I'm happy working on Ubuntu full-time, which inherits the most awesome software repository ever from Debian. It may not be the shiniest  and most polished operating system ever, but it treats me well as a developer, it doesn't restrict me in any way and I never had any problem that's unworkable.<p><pre><code>     BTW, I'll give you all a hint on good design: \n     minimal is a synonym for good. Exterminate features.\n</code></pre>\nIn general people saying that don't know what they are talking about. Any simple interface that actually does what you want is actually a beast under the hood. If it isn't then the software is mostly useless.<p>What most people are missing: the interface/software should do  what you want, not the other way around.<p>This is my biggest problem with Ubuntu lately. I would have rather preferred for them to not fuck around with Gnome's interface, pulling out a proven and working interface, replacing it with broken software in the name of simplicity.

3490953,comment,3489719,3490364,7,0,ChuckMcM,,,"<i>""Early startup employees get completely and utterly screwed.""</i><p>Except that early Google employees all had stock worth over a million dollars. Same with all early Sun employees, all early eBay employees, all early Amazon employees, all early Yahoo employees (basically anyone with an employee # < 100 was in darn good shape at all of these companies.<p>The generalization that all employees get screwed, is based on your experience. and I understand that pain, my first startup I was employee #9 and my stock at the time it was acquired [1] was worthless. But it is just that, a generalization. And it is perfectly reasonable to say ""My threshold for risk is lower than the risk of working at a startup."" And by telling a startup you won't work for less than 10% equity or even going in with that thought is one way of saying that.<p>I interviewed a guy for the second startup I did, FreeGate, who told me basically he had 'done his homework' and he needed 4 million (about 5% of the outstanding at the time) shares and a competitive salary (which during the boom was insane) and while I loved his skills I wasn't comfortable risking that much equity on this guy who might or might not work out. So we passed. He eventually went to work for Oracle because no startup he talked to would (or perhaps even could) hire him based on his risk tolerance.<p>In that case I think the market did the right thing, he didn't work at a startup. Now had he come to work for me at the 'standard' offer during that period, he would have done OK, better than 4 years of Oracle salary + their option, but not the multiple millions he was dreaming about. I always recommend that people who absolutely have to be employed for the next 'n' years, avoid start-ups. Too much existence stress.<p>That being said, I like Joel's approach. The only wrench I see in it is that there often comes a time when you need 'that guy' (or 'that gal') who will take the company to the next level. Could be a VP of sales, or a Manufacturing, or some other part of the company that it needs to do, but nobody in the company is experienced or ready to take the company to the scale it needs. That is a person who comes late but you end up doling out lots of equity to. The return is that everyone's equity value will go way up. Sometimes this person is the difference between continued climb and spiraling death. So in that regard their 'impact' is as much as a founder who got the company to this point.<p>When that situation comes up, it's always got its own wrinkles to deal with, but generally it comes up because you are doing well, not you're shopping yourself around to try to exit with a positive spin.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.linksv.com/compSummary/2172/GolfWeb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.linksv.com/compSummary/2172/GolfWeb</a>",1327089341

Some employees that had nothing to do with it get laid off to keep up the bottom line?<p>I think the point here is to stop the behavior and give out just enough punishment to keep them from doing it again, but not excessive so as to damage the business. In this case, the problem is the companies were colluding to deprive people of jobs and to lower salaries. The desired outcome is to ensure a fair hiring and salary negotiation process. A settlement achieves that with minimal cost to the government and minimum collateral damage to the tens of thousands of people who had nothing to do with it.<p>Businesses and individuals are completely different and there should be different standards for dealing out punishments.<p>That said, the case you mentioned seems absurd and unfair.

There are many, many different people with different views prosecuting cases. Some are more lenient than others, within the legislated guidelines. Different regions have different prevailing standards for justice. Even in the same town you have ball breaker judges and ones with a reputation for letting people off easy. If the law provides guidelines you can be sure that people will be spread out all across the spectrum of what is allowed. Getting 12 years for selling pot sucks. I'd be pretty pissed if I were in her shoes. If I were a judge I wouldn't think of giving out that kind of sentence. I would go so far as to say I think the judge who did is wrong, even if he did give a sentence allowed by law. But I'm also not the kind of dumbass who would sell pot. If you do stupid, obviously illegal things you put yourself at the mercy of a person who might just throw your ass in a hole for the next decade.",1327088801

The last one was a startup on mobile game servers.<p>I'm currently in a situation to choose between offers, and right now not able to make a clear decision.<p>One option is work with a mid-size team (160+) that has steady growth but no press for a while, working infrastructure on a large MMO that spans new services to the C++ client. Will be part of a 40 engineering team to work on problems with lots of users and real-time systems with Python/C++. Also will be part of working on their new product.<p>Another option is to join big corp to work on a well-known open source project with lots of press, defining the latest standard on deploying cloud apps. Will be part of a larger team working with ruby/java and some well known industry leaders on components to enhance command line automation and features.<p>I'm a bit torn because I love working on MMOs, and always want to escape java/ruby a bit to work on C++ and python. However, it's definitely not as huge as working on the other project and to work with some well-known engineers is a great plus.<p>Would appreciate some advice from the community!",1327088750

Please note that this post is for informative purposes, not normative ones.<p>The thing which is ""magical"", to use your term, is the family unit comprised of a mother and a father <i>and their children</i>. The children are exposed to both male and female influences, the combination of which is generally recognized as beneficial to their emotional development. The mother and father both have a stake in the upbringing of the children, without attendant conflicts of interest and jealousy. They may also be incentivized towards caring about future generations, building a better world for their children, and a number of other things.<p>Without that context of the family unit, there is, in fact, significantly less which can be said to be ""magic"" about the number 2. Notice that ""family"" occupies a significant portion of the cultural conversation of religious opposition to marriage-related issues, particularly internally-directed conversation (though the likes of 'god hates <x>' is another significant portion and usually louder / easier to find).<p>Again, this post is informative, not normative. Judgements on the extent to which any of these matters are desirable, and how much they ought to affect the social validity of a marriage of 3, 4, 5, or more, or marriages between 2 people (heterosexual or otherwise) who are not in the business of having children, or alternative ways to achieve any desirable goal mentioned in the above paragraphs, are once again left as exercises to the reader.<p>Note also that a pragmatic argument <i>against</i> 3+-person marriages exists, and relates to the fact that these are almost always polygynyous marriages and there may be negative social implications to having many unmarried males around, rendering societies more prone to crime, war, and other things. Again, the extent to which this is true and ought to influence social policy? Figure it out yourself.",1327087630

There might be other people contemplating starting a service like this, so as somebody who also considered it, I'll post the important parts here:<p>1. Most teachers are willing to help out students. Why would a student\npay for your service?<p>2. An obvious answer to the above is ""we'll focus on the students that\nhave teachers that are unwilling to help"". From my experience, that's\na small market.<p>3. You also have to consider that the ones who would be interested in\nthis service are ones who really want to have a good essay (I'll come\nback to this later); the union of the two sets is even smaller. I'm\nnot entirely sure you would be able to churn profits from just this\nsubset.<p>4. Moving beyond teachers, how will you compete with EssayJudge? They\noffer an amazing service for nothing. The quality of their service is\nhard to beat already, and their price impossible to overcome.<p>5. How will you vet the quality of your ""teachers""? If a student isn't\nhappy with the response, will you refund the money? What if your\ncustomers are immoral? (I've found that the union of immoral people\nand students is quite large.) Looking on HN, I see somebody mentioning ""chargebacks""; that would indeed be a big problem.<p>6. What is your target market? Are you aiming for people who want to\nbuy ghostwriters, or are you aiming for people who simply want to get\na good grade (from ""Doing well on essays is part of doing well in\nschool, and doing well in school leads to a better life!"", that seems\nto be your target audience), or are you aiming for people who really\nwant to improve their writing?\nIt seems that you're focusing on the penultimate, but is that really a\ngood decision? Why wouldn't they just hire a ghostwriter instead?<p>7. An easy answer is ""they're pretty good writers already, they just\nneed that little bit of editing"". If so, it looks like you're focusing\non the last group. That's where the money lies, but your advertising\ndoesn't seem to be targeted towards them.<p>This is by no means a complete list of the problems you'll face. You should probably have answers to many of these before starting/going forwards though.",1327087242

You either fail to grasp logic, or basic English. I'm not sure which. Regardless, neither of these words refer to your grasp of history, nor your ability to ground theory within it. I'm not ""mistaking"" anything for anything, as your concept is demonstrably devoid of both.<p>""This is what I mean when I say that copyright (in the modern, IP sense) ultimately accrued to the author. ""<p>Stop lying. You meant no such thing and you know it. Indeed, you very clearly said the opposite. Specifically. ""In addition, from the very beginning, copyright was an individual author right that accrued to people, not companies.""<p>And again ""copyright (in the modern, IP sense)"" means the legal ability duplicate, distribute, and creative derivatives from. Those were activities that the guild system specifically BARRED authors from doing. To say their need to buy manuscripts means that, effectively, these privileges ""accrue"" to the author is not true. And about ""buying licences""; there were no licences to buy. You just made that up.<p>Let's remember the whole point of your original argument; that copyright - as an individual right - has ""always"" been the authors, and that our legal tradition has recognized ""since the very beginning of printing."" As noted, this is completely counter to reality. And now you're saying this isn't really what you meant, but sort of is because of these imaginary ""licences""? Aside from the guild's charters, there were no licences. Only physical ownership and control of the manuscripts themselves, which was exchanged for money on unfavorable terms from the only legal buyers in town. Yes, that was a crappy system. No, it didn't give authors their due. And it ended in 1709, which is about two and a half centuries after the advent of movable type. Moving on.<p>""There was not much time following Gutenberg when it was legal for printers to copy whatever the heck they wanted.""<p>True, but that had everything to do with censorship by the Church, and not respect for the rights of authors. Indeed, those two interests have tended to be at sharp odds. See my point above about authors and rights and who could do what ""at the very beginning"".<p>""Recognition of authorship was a social norm that predated the printing press, and was very soon incorporated into the regulation of the new technology.""<p>If a custom pertaining to simple credit is your example of early copyright (i.e. what prevailed for the first 260 years), then you simply have no idea what copyright even covers. Just...none.<p>Also, who are you to say ""very soon"" about anything? Haven't we already established that your grasp of actual history is a confused and distorted mess of near bottomless error? Given your hilariously awful track record, you have no business making assertions about specific timeframes without clear citations.<p>""To return to my (now demolished) broader point, try this thought experiment...""<p>I've got a better idea. Instead of acting like a person who is quite literally moronic, why don't you take a moment to realize that you have been completely and totally schooled. Everything, from your grasp of history, to your understanding of words, to the honesty of your arguments, to the clarity of your theoretical understanding has just been handed back to you in shit covered shreds, and now there is a smoking crater where your credibility used to be.<p>This is where the normal, decent, reasonably self-respecting human would think ""Wow, I really put my foot in it. I actually have no idea about any of this stuff. The worst part is that I didn't even realize how clueless I was. And there I was, starting of my remarks to others with snide personal insults about who belongs ""in the uninformed camp"". Instead of continuing to behave like an idiot, I'm going to spend some time actually learning about all this, and then, perhaps, I can save myself some embarrassment, and maybe even answer my own questions.""<p>Questions like ""Why would a major paradigm change in the economics and distribution of a particular kind of technology upset the related body of law that developed over the course of three centuries under an entirely different paradigm?""<p>You'll be pleased to know that this is exactly what my original remark covered. Provided that you're clever enough to realize that you were under some very serious illusions when reading those remarks, and not understanding them at all as a result, try going back and reading them again, and see if you can figure out the answer to your own question.<p>If you can't, then study harder. You'll know that you've got a passable grasp of history, politics, economics, and publishing when the answer to your question about trends in the marginal costs of publication and the extent of authorial control appears to be the opposite of your present understanding, for reasons that should be self-evident.<p>Good luck.",1327086859

I like the architecture of lift, just not some of the details of the implementation.<p>I don't like the way templates are forced to use snippets to load data, in particular as it results in snippets being dependent on the database, and thus not suitable for unit testing.  The framework should be pulling the data into the view, which then passes it as an argument to the snippet to do whatever transformation on it.  That way snippets are entirely self-contained and easy to unit-test.  This is the sort of thing that I think would have ended up the way I want had it been written in haskell instead of scala just because writing small, self-contained functions is the typical haskell way of doing things.<p>I hate the very opinionated nature of the form handling, and the even more opinionated responses from the developers to questions like ""how can I make a form that works normally and doesn't require a session"".  People are not bad for wanting forms to behave normally, and the ""security"" show the lift devs put on to justify the form handling in lift is insulting.<p>While I find templates acceptable, they are seriously missing out on type safety.  I should get a compiler error if I create a template with invalid html.  Ocsigen got this part very right (an ocaml framework/appserver).  Not only do I not get this benefit for my markup, but lift itself generates invalid html on me when using virtually any of the included form generation methods.  Very annoying.<p>Ideally what I want is a framework that gives me the type safety of yesod, but with the structure of lift.  I hate faux-mvc web frameworks and find they make things more difficult rather than making things easier, and unfortunately yesod copies the typical rails clone structure.  Lift doesn't make the mistake of trying to hide http from me, and gives me the simple and correct mapping of template to url, leaves the domain model in the model instead of cramming it into ""controllers"" that shouldn't be involved.",1327086037

If I understand stripe's fees, you will pay 65 cents per transaction.  You are paying teachers via paypal, I do not know their fees but it will probably be in the ballpark of 50-60 cents to transfer 10 dollars.  So 12 -10 - 0.65 - paypal fees = 0.75 to 0.85 profit per transaction.  Not sure how automated everything is, but it seems like you will be doing a bit of work for what amounts to a large pack of gum.<p>Now consider chargebacks.  Stripe charges a 15 dollar fee per chargeback.  So for each chargeback you lose (15+10+1.25(transaction fees above) = 26.25 or so.  I have a feeling you will have a larger than average number of chargebacks due to children borrowing their parent's credit card to get their essay graded.<p>I assume you are paying the teachers as independent contractors?

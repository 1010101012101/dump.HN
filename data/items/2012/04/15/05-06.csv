3842904,comment,3841463,3842596,8,0,sgentle,,,"Oh, I don't think Amazon is cheating. The whole point of disintermediation is to be more efficient and drive down prices. I'm certain prices will be lower under King Bezos, and perhaps payments to authors will stay high (though that's far less certain).<p>It's important to consider that Amazon has always behaved quite consistently. Even when it had 90% of the ebook market, it was the one pushing to keep prices down. In its other markets (cloud services, physical books, other goods), evidence suggests that it tries to cut prices as much as possible. I'd go so far as to say it's part of Amazon's culture. I don't think they know how to have a big fat margin on something. It'd make them itchy, like their very own fat middleman waiting to be crushed.<p>So my issue isn't that Amazon is waiting patiently to pump up their prices once they have enough market share. It's more that having no competition is dangerous in itself. Google and Valve, for example, are two companies that I like immensely, and I think they do a great job in their respective markets. Yet Google can arbitrarily cut off access to my email, and Valve can do the same with my games. Both have been known to use these powers when it makes sense to them. I'd change providers, but everyone else, frankly, sucks.<p>I want there to be robust competition in e-readers, but the Kindle is too good. I want there to be robust competition for e-bookstores but Amazon always has the best prices. There's a kind of bittersweet ambivalence in knowing that the industry leader is there because they're a clever company doing it right, but still wishing that someone else was there to challenge them.

This is the one potential problem area if you don't have semi-colons everywhere, so you can avoid almost all (or maybe actually all) problems just by prepending a semi-colon to those lines.<p>I think Ricardo's point is that this style (having a semi-colon only before parentheses at the beginning of the line) makes your intentions more explicit.",1334466497

It's the arrogance and stupidity of youth facing the crotchety crankiness of experience. Crockford has earned the right to have a strong opinion here IMO.<p>But it's not just bike-shedding. It's more pernicious than that. It's actually something that <i>looks</i> like bike-shedding to uninformed observers, but something that strongly affects cross-version compatibility. Javascript does automatic semicolon insertion by taking advantage of potentially ambiguous constructs that happen to be resolved in one way right now. But they may be actually ambiguous in the future - in the case where a unary prefix operator becomes a binary operator. Language extension usually works this way: a previously unambiguously wrong statement is made valid; but JS semicolon insertion often turns ""wrong"" statements into ""correct"" statements, so it leaves less ""entropy"" to be taken advantage of when increasing the power of the syntax. I think there's a strong case for JS to <i>not</i> insert semicolons here, and I agree with Crockford's position on not handling it in JSMin. It's the right thing to do.",1334466462

3842837,comment,3842713,3842793,6,0,tikhonj,,,"Amusingly, I agree with your premise but not really your conclusion. Adding a semi-colon <i>is</i> like adding parentheses. But I think redundant parentheses add visual clutter--unless I have a very complicated expression, I leave them off. (Maybe it's the Haskell code style rubbing off on me...)<p>So I actually think that 1 + 2 * 3 is better than 1 + (2 * 3). I usually find reading a line with less stuff easier, so I prefer the shorter between two equivalent expression.<p>Besides, adding a semi-colon is more like surrounding the <i>whole</i> expression with parentheses rather than just grouping. And you would never write (1 + (2 * 3)). And yet that also says, loud and clear, the same thing!<p>I've used some languages with optional semi-colons--Python and Haskell, for example. I've never thought that missing them made the code less readable--it's always been the opposite. Going back to Java and having to use semi-colons everywhere becomes increasing annoying as I grow more acclimated to languages without.<p>In short, I see where you're coming from but don't really agree.",1334466119

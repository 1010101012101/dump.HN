You're right, it may be difficult for shareholders to sue the management even if they make inefficient or even self-serving decisions. But lawsuits are not the only means by which people can hold other people accountable. Shareholders have the right to fire the management, <i>in addition to</i> the right to withhold further investment. Donors to charities only have the latter right.<p>So I'm only disagreeing with your claim #2 that charities are more accountable than these new types of corporations.

3511697,comment,3510947,3511462,11,0,pudquick,,,"The reason one is called static and involves 3d space and the other is called dynamic and involves time has nothing to do with stealing particles from the future or creating a perpetual motion/energy machine.<p>What differs in these effects (in space and in time) is the electromagnetic modes of the vacuum near the mirror(s).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode#Quantum_mechanics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_mode#Quantum_mechanics</a><p>It's all about creating a differential - and the effect this has for static vs. dynamic is different for each.<p>In the static effect, a differential is created in 3d space: two mirrors are perfectly placed in parallel to each other with a gap less than that of a photon's wavelength. In the vacuum fluctuation of space, virtual photons and anti-photon pairs are created and annihilate each other all the time - but this tiny gap keeps them from appearing between the mirrors. The end result is a difference in the modes between the mirrors (total lack of any activity) and outside them (normal vacuum fluctuations) which results in a pressure differential (in 3d space) pushing the plates together (the static effect).<p>In the dynamic effect, a differential is created due to a change over time: a mirror is moved at a velocity significantly close to the speed of light (in this case, around 5%). Around the mirror, as always, the vacuum contains photon and anti-photon pairs coming into existence and annihilating each other. With a fast enough moving mirror, the mirror can change the ability of the particles to annihilate each other. This represents a change in time over the nature of the vacuum / space where the particles appear.<p>Thought example: Prior to pair formation, there is no mirror at coordinate XYZ. Proton and anti-proton pair appears - and mirror is moving so fast, it is now present at point XYZ, between the proton and anti-proton, faster than the two could reach and annihilate each other. Now, instead of annihilation, the proton is reflected by the mirror.<p>This is the dynamical Casimir effect. It is a change, over time, in the nature of vacuum.<p>Yes, photons are being reflected (""created from nothing"") in this effect - but so are anti-photons, which quickly find some other photon to interact with and annihilates the pair of them. There is no net gain of energy here - in fact quite a bit is spent keeping the mirror moving at high speeds.",1327525077

Originality does not require that the work be exceptionally creative or unique, only that it possess a mere modicum of creativity and is the product of independent creation."" ('Oxford Guide to American Law', page 661)<p>Lastly I'm going to grab my own quote from Feist V Rural Telecom (eg <a href=""http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=499&invol=340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&#3...</a> [why didn't I hit up FindLaw first, they're always good for this sort of thing]) - a US Court of Appeal judgement:<p>""Originality does not signify novelty; a work may be original even though it closely resembles other works so long as the similarity is fortuitous, not the result of copying.""",1327524625

The young are disproportionately on the losing end of inequality and the perpetrating end of crime. (Regardless of how poor they are and how rich their neighbors, the elderly simply can't flip a car anymore.)<p>If you had, say, a bulge in the poor demographic around 1970 and expected crime to increase with a rise in inequality, you would expect to see the spike in crime from 1970 to 1990 <i>and</i> you would expect to see it subside as that bulge grew older and transitioned out of the age groups that perpetrate crime.<p>So, again, we cannot trivially rule out inequality as minor just because a simple plot of crime rates and a simple plot of inequality do not suggest a straightforward correlation.",1327524358

The program's interface allows one to click and drill down one or two levels, but the descriptions are often more non-descriptive than descriptive.  And then one faces a link (which is, by the way, not tooltipped or otherwise designated as a link) that fires up your browser and takes you to a web page on the security software vendor's (in this case, Norton) web site.<p>Well, that's f-ing annoying.  And then, to boot, often the page that is navigated to contains content that is little or no more helpful in telling you what specifically they detected or why specifically the warning/action triggered.<p>I recall one case in particular, where going through all this and reading between the lines, it appeared that the quarantine was the result of a ""reputation"" trigger.  Norton wasn't familiar with the executable and it didn't have much or any presence in their reputation system, so the default action was to flag it a ""high security"" risk and to ""quarantine"" it.<p>I understand there is a balancing act.  If you don't keep it simple and use strong enough language, Joe Blow user may start to disregard the warnings, until soon enough s/he has a real problem.<p>But as a more advanced user, this is completely frustrating.  I want to know what the problem is, so that I can make an informed decision with regard to the ""security event"".<p>(And yes, on the Windows machine, I do run Norton.  Comes with my only Internet connectivity option, anyway, and it makes an acceptable, and useful, component of a layered defense.)",1327524140

If you have to use an online tool, use Trello (<a href=""http://trello.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trello.com</a>)<p>This ""future behavior"" stuff only becomes important as part of promising work to be done. Since it's only you, and you're only ""promising"" this stuff to yourself, it kind of doesn't make sense right now. (Unless you are very forgetful or get off-track easily) If you really think you need it, each week have a ""theme"" or ""story"" that you're working on (along with everything else). Maybe one week it's ""When the user visits the site, he sees all the recent activity that has to do with him so he can respond"" There's a magic formula to story titles, but that's a longer post.<p>But for now I imagine you can track that kind of stuff in your own head. If you're worried about bringing somebody else on, I can see where it might be good to get in the habit about making clear what the goal is. You'll need it later.<p>As you grow, you might have several of these ""stories"" that you've promised to do in the next week or so. You might have a bunch more on the back burner. At that point you're into a full-time backlog. As you grow, process emerges. We can talk in generalities, but a lot of how it's going to look in the future depends on the people and the project. Learn Agile not as a recipe book, but as a conceptual framework -- a bunch of ideas and how they are related to each other -- for stuff you might (or might not) need to add as you figure out how to kick ass. RUP is like Windows, it comes in a big, nice bundle you get out of the box and take home. But it never really works perfectly, it's way too commercialized, and it's a freaking huge amount of stuff for what you really need. Agile is much more like Unix, you get a big bag full of parts and a picture of a golden mansion.

It is worse to be screwed by someone who claims to be trustworthy than someone you know is not.  For example, we all knew Microsoft was shady from the beginning so we didn't expect much.  But you guys said it was all about relevancy, the user, do no evil, etc.  Look at this way, if a girl married Gene Simmons could she honestly be pissed if he was cheating on her?  But if a girl married a guy like Donnie Osmond and he cheated she would be devastated.  She was probably only with him in the first place because he was trustworthy.  You are Donnie Osmond. :)<p>Anyway, if you guys came clean and said that you are trying to promote your network then maybe people wouldn't be so pissed.  As of right now, it looks like you are trying to drive traffic to your own irrelevant content over legitimate content businesses.  Since you have a dominant position in search and hundreds of thousands of companies/sites depend on your traffic, they are scared.  Google is rapidly getting into the content game and people can only assume you will put your new content above everyone else's.

3511558,comment,3506025,3506025,1,0,costacoast,,,"As a web developer I have typically argued in favor of write once, execute everywhere robust web apps being the future of mobile interaction. Having built websites and apps designed to work well on mobile however, this typically leads to a stream of constant headaches trying to accommodate for the myriad of different mobile browsers and features each support/allow.<p>Similar to the way that different desktop browsers each roll out new feature support, and often times support features in completely different ways (CSS transparencies/gradients anyone?) mobile browsers have even slower and more varied support for features and interaction control. This problem with desktop browsers has kept most web developers and firms I work with from integrating the latest and greatest HTML5/CSS3 features in all their sites, because there is a huge handicap in trying to optimize for so many different platforms as each evolves on its own timeline.<p>Even though writing the same app to work well in both iOS and Android is a HUGE undertaking, the advantage is you are only writing your application to meet two different sets of API specifications. Even better yet since mobile devs are typically either iOS OR Android experts you can potentially have two different teams of devs working on the platform they know best instead of having one html team constantly striving to make your application work well (or at all) in a dozen different commonly used mobile web browsers.<p>I applaud Facebook for their efforts to build out a really great looking mobile web app that does look an awful like their mobile apps, but has anyone watched someone who doesn't know (or care) about the difference between a native app and mobile web app use it? I got a fairly tech-savvy family member a kindle fire recently and it comes pre-installed with a shortcut to the Facebook mobile web app because the native app is not available in the amazon marketplace. Watching over their shoulder I was amazed to see how frustrating the experience was for them when the querystring gets corrupted at certain points and all they are left with is a PHP whitescreen of death. No loading symbol, no ability to get out of the corrupted state the browser got itself into, and generally the user was left with no idea why this wasn't working as nicely as their Facebook app on iOS/Android that looks exactly the same.<p>At the end of the day I now lean more toward the side of mobile apps continuing to be more efficient and effective for apps that require lots of interaction with the user even if you could technically implement all those interactions in a browser. The relative simplicity of only having to code for two platforms instead of 12, and simultaneously providing your users with a more responsive experience is definitely worth it.",1327523073

Imagine if Google launched a Flickr clone tomorrow with very few users and suddenly on GIS's a quarter of the top results were reserved for Google's Flickr clone.

It is almost universally agreed among economist that have not been cheerleading for the past 5 years that inflation is coming, when it does house prices will decline further. That coupled with the mortgage fraud crisis means that housing recovery is a long way off.<p>Rationally looking at the situation you are below zero, putting your retirement into it, compounds the problem because you are not elevating the sinking asset while you are depleting hard cash. It's the old don't throw good money after bad.<p><i>I believe in honoring your debts but I also want to be pragmatic</i><p>We each have to come to grips with what we find acceptable, some things to remember though are that you may have paid into mortgage insurance, to insure the home from a default. Some people see that as a ethical out, after-all if you paid into it you secured the bank from the event, you should be entitled to utilize it. Others find it ethically agreeable that the banks where bailed out with public money, and therefore the public has the right to in-turn ease the burden on themselves, it is the moral hazard argument that people raised in bailing out the banks. That if we did so, it would give people the ethical right to opt out of being the one holding the bag. It is a moral hazard but I do see both sides of the argument. For me personally I believe we are a civilization of people first, I know at this particular time we sometimes don't act like it, but my personal ethics are people are the most important. As such I believe no person should be asked to personally bear the brunt of any socitial issue, if an issue is causing suffering, which I consider financial hardship to be, then I think that we as a society should support them remedying that situation, even if it contributes to the problem. What we can't have is a class of entities like the banks who are able to pass the burden and then citizens, who are then expected to grin and bare it. To do so asks members of our society who have the least resources, to suffer for the common good. Personally I think we are long past the moral arguments of walking away, either by short sale or foreclosure. Asking homeowners to bare the cost of propping up the inflated housing market, when we did not do so with the banks is unethical in my world view. We as Americans seem to hold a double standard on issues like this, where companies are given a free pass, but yet the citizens are held to a code of honor. It leaves the population ripe for exploitation, by creating two distinct sets of rules.",1327521664

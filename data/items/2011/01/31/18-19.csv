I knew how to exactly when something was going wrong, I didn't have that power of clarity when I was using a framework. But over time I've learnt the following lessons:<p>1. I was naive to think that my code would be better than the code of an established frameworks that have undergone through extensive testing by a big community.<p>2. It's a lot harder to bring people on board to help with coding. I can navigate my code very easily, but many people who are used to how to do things in a framework found it very hard.<p>3. Without the help of a community, I had to code EVERYTHING myself. There is no gem or plugin to install, which will REALLY help speed things along. In a startup environment, speed is a real competitive advantage, every bit of speed you can gain over your competitor should be pursued. I can't stress this enough.<p>4. When you run into serious problems, Google search is unlikely to help if you don't use a framework. You're likely the only one with that problem. Whereas if you use a framework, there's a very high chance other people have run into the problem before, and the error thrown out will be in a Stack Overflow or a bug tracker somewhere. Your life will be much easier when trying to track down serious bugs.<p>I used to use PHP for about 5 years, and I think the problem with PHP and frameworks is that there are so many frameworks around, and we just don't know which one are the one to use. So many developers have this question. Code Igniter or Kohana or CakePHP or... 20 other frameworks out there? It really sucks when you have to put in the time to figure out which frameworks work for you, and it's one of the reasons why people don't use a framework in the first place. Where as for Python, Django is a clear winner and Ruby, there's RoR. Those languages have many other frameworks too, but they have a clear winner with a large community who could help you.<p>As for me? I'm now doing almost everything in Ruby and Rails, and not looking back. I feel very good about the way I work now. I have become as good with Rails as I was with my own code, and it only took a few months. I suggest you give it another try. It will be time consuming at first, but it's very worthwhile in the long run.",1296499104

2162598,comment,2161753,2162393,0,0,PaulHoule,,,"Well,  there are quite a few commercial database vendors that offer parallel and clustered RDBMS products,  and many of them appear to be quite good.<p>Unfortunately,  they've got a terrible marketing problem.<p>Before 1998 or so,  a relational database was an expensive product that you got from a vendor like Oracle.  Since then,  a generation of people have grown up that think about using a commercial RDBMS the same way most of us think about putting our hands in a toilet.<p>@va_coder hits the nail right on the head,  it's not just the cost of the product,  it's the cost of the buying process.<p>If I want to trial a product that is open source or has an OS or free edition (that could be mysql, mongodb, postgres or even Virtoso OpenLink or SQL Server Express) I can download it,  read the docs and play around with it and learn a lot in a few hours.  I might learn that the product is not for me,  or I might get a positive impression and feel ready to commit coding time to it.<p>If I want to trial Oracle or Clustrix,  well,  I'm going to have to start a contact with a sales organization and then they need to pre-qualify me,  and then they need to qualify me and then I'll spend a few hours on the phone talking to people (which might take a few weeks in wall-clock time.)<p>Even if they give me a 30 day free trial,  I could easily spend $500+ of my time just getting the trial...  And once I've gotten to the point where I'm negotiating with one vendor I'm going to feel a lot of pressure (internally or from my superiors) to talk with some competitive vendors too to make sure I'm making the right decision.<p>It's a shame because,  certainly,  a company like Clustrix could use the revenue they get from product sales to support an awesome development team and really deliver a better product.  On the other hand,  they have marketing channels that are aimed at large organizations that can afford an expensive buying experience...  and it's an expensive selling process for them when they've got to do ""complex sales"" that require approvals from a large number of stakeholders.  They've got to pass those costs onto you.<p>The trouble with this model is that tomorrow's large organizations are today's small organizations.  Today,  Facebook could afford just about any commercial software that's out there.  However,  they made critical technology decisions (that are difficult to reverse) back when they were a little company that could only afford MySQL.",1296498785

Even worse, that URL may end up in third party projects as a submodule (which is much more difficult to retroactively change).<p>Again: the problem here is not that GitHub is somehow encouraging people to keep things at GitHub ""centrally"": it isn't, and the goal is not to have your data in multiple places.<p>In fact, that's what you need to /avoid/: there should be a single URL for ""this is the git repository that we consider to be the official, canonical source for our (distributed) contributions to this project"".<p>That URL should be one that you feel comfortable you can maintain for a long time, as that URL can end up baked into a lot of things.

Since to have a 144 ""digit"" we must already be in base > 144, as chosen by what appears to be your problem, there's no other possible solution.

It may be the ordinal identifier of some digit, but it is not itself a digit, which by definition is a single atomic unit in your number digitization scheme. (That is, your atomic glyph may itself be encoded by multiple glyphs in another scheme, I could imagine representing base 1296 numbers (36 times 36) by definition as two base36 numbers with the obvious English encoding, but in the base1296 encoding a ""digit"" would be two alphanums in the English encoding.

Maybe it's because I'm already familiar with Ruby, but the ""multi paradigm"" (i.e. no paradigm) nature of Scala leaves me cold.  It's kinda-sorta OO, kinda-sorta functional.  But the functional part gives no guarantees of referential transparency or immutable state, so the killer value of FP is lost.<p>But, language rant aside, even if Scala were the cat's meow, you still have to include the Scala base libraries with every app.  Proguard may help, but it seems wasteful.<p>Mirah, OTOH, compiles down to straight-up JVM byte code. No supporting runtime libs are needed. Very slick.",1306346324
2584878,comment,2583801,2584018,4,0,krschultz,,,"Excuse me from being confrontational, I'm certainly not judging you but I think you have far more control over your situation than you think.<p>Have you paid back your debts and used credit responsibily since then? I'd be really surprised if you had made amends and your credit report was still hosed.<p>Now if you are saying you don't think your credit report should reflect unpaid debts even though they were 'years ago', that is fundamentally unfair to those that use credit responsibly. Everyone else pays more interest to make up for those that default. There is really no argument to be made that you shouldn't have to be squared up on your debts to get more loans.<p>And no matter how many hours you claim to want to work, if you think not being able to get credit destines you to poverty you don't understand credit. Credit doesn't make you any richer, it just time shifts future income to a lump sum in the present. It is the inverse of savings. In fact it makes you poorer unless you do something with the money that earns a greater return than the cost of the loan.<p>So are you saying you are going to take out a loan with a 100% chance you need to repay it and start a business with a 50/50 or worse chance of working out? And if it fails you will default on the loan? Because if you are complaining about poverty now, wait until you have a loan for a business that failed miserably, then you will be really screwed. So funding a business on credit a fundamentally risky thing and if you already have one black mark on your credit report it is probably not a good avenue for you anyway.<p>And don't say that not having credit means you can't start your business. The above paragraph explains why I'm not starting my business on credit. I'm funding it by saving. I work 40-70 hours a week (certainly not 100, I physically couldn't do that). I do 40-50 at my salaried job, and about 1-20 on starting by business outside of work depending on if I work all weekend or not. Does it suck not having free time? Absolutely. But at the end of the day my business is funded from my own cashflow, with no debt or interest to anyone. And no matter how bad your credit history is, you can always save and bootstrap like that.<p>Blaming being unable to start a business on people not willing to lend you their money is just an excuse. At the end of the day your credit score, whether or not you start a business, this is all under your own control.<p>(And if HN doesn't mind a plug, I personally learned a lot from Ric Edelman, he has a free podcast and a personal finance 101 book called the Truth about Money that I learned quite a bit from, but the fundamental thing he preaches is simple math. Make more money than you spend)",1306346321

For example (and this is not meant to be a comparison to copyright, just an example of attitudes not changing), while it appears to mostly be older people against gay marriage, that does not mean that younger people are misinformed and will change their minds on it as they grow older. Somethings are actually generational shifts in attitude, independent of the generation's age. I do agree that it's possible that the current generation may shift to a more conservative view on copyright as it ages, since that happens with many issues, but it can sound somewhat offensive depending on how you worded it. I think it's a point worth considering, but sadly many people will have a negative reaction against something that looks ""You'll get it when you're older"", and that may prevent them from considering the idea in a more neutral light.<p>As for whether it's correct, I'd lean towards ""No"". I think young people who grow up to produce content they want to commercially develop may, but that's likely going to be a minority. I don't think the majority that casually illegally download things without a second thought will have a change of heart. It being wrong just doesn't seem to enter most people's minds. I think part of the reason is the overly harsh propaganda against it. While there is a core ideal worth considering (""Artists should be compensated for their work""), the ridiculous exaggeration (""Pirating movies supports TERRORISM"") leads to people ignoring the issue.",1306345019

2584661,comment,2582126,2584396,1,0,amalcon,,,"The main reason I was thinking of is that it's very difficult to do public-key encryption correctly.  The normal advice is to just use GPG (or a similarly battle-tested library).  The way these work makes ciphertext comparison meaningless.  That's a good thing for almost all applications, but not for this one.  The alternative is to use code that has not been so thoroughly battle-tested.<p>Your application is a much more straightforward application of PKI.  You don't need to compare ciphertext, so you could just use GPG.  (Please consult someone more expert than me, though.  I am not responsible if there's a security problem, etc, etc).<p>As a secondary reason, public-key encryption is ""fast by design"", while password hashing techniques are hopefully not.  This makes brute-force attacks easier.  This actually applies more strongly to SSN's (only a billion possible combinations?  Simple!).  This can be worked around by adding a properly secured password hash of sufficient length to the plaintext, essentially adding the additional computation of the password hash.",1306343058

Apple is very good at polishing things, at integration, supply chains and marketing; extremely good, and they even have a very good record on fonts - but don't listen to Jobs' story on this or you will think we would still be using the command line for everything - however they get orders of magnitude too much credit when it comes to innovation.",1306343001

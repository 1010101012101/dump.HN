Since they use a CDN to distribute updates, these might still be downloaded over HTTP and still not be verified prior to running.<p>-- Update --<p>You got to be kidding me. So I upgraded my fake update server with a self-signed certificate (with a wrong CN, no less) and of course, the 1Password client happily accepts it.<p>Theres some good news, though. They now verify that the downloaded binary is signed (with their own key)!<p>But since I can control the update server that tells the client what to download, I can just supply the client with an old 1Password build that is still signed but does not implement the strong(isher) scheme in build #333. The installer doesn&#x27;t complain and what user keeps track of build numbers anyway.",1378573194

CLRS has a lot of proofs in it.<p>* CLRS uses pseudocode, while Sedgewick uses actual code.  I think they use Java now (it was Pascal in the edition that I had used).<p>* Sedgewick is really a practitioners introduction.  It views the algorithmic problem as the jumping off point. Whereas CLRS is more an intro for people who are going to study computer science -- so it focuses on the methods.<p>Both good texts.  I think for most programmers I&#x27;d recommend Sedgewick, but if your goal is to be a computer scientist, then I&#x27;d recommend CLRS.",1378573184

Start with easy ones to learn how to best digest highly academic technical writing then keep pushing.<p>CS is remarkable in how much of its academic knowledge is online, available, for free. Taking advantage of that resource is beyond key.<p>If you know roughly what you want to learn, search out a seminal paper in that area. If it&#x27;s deep CS, you&#x27;ll probably find a good one from the 80s. Seek out every citation that&#x27;s proximal to a sentence in that paper that confuses or excites you. Search on Google Scholar for all the recent papers that cite the one you found and begin eating up the chain that direction. When you find a deep topic you want to learn more ofset theory, logic, formal languages, discrete math, matrix analysis, automata theory, geometry, topology, &c.don&#x27;t be afraid to look for a good book on the topic. There are resources around the internet answering &quot;What&#x27;s a good introductory book to X&quot; for all kinds of X.<p>If you don&#x27;t know the general area you&#x27;re interested in then I recommend the exact same strategy but with greater emphasis on following citations that make connections to other areas of CS. Additionally, pick a few disjoint topics (Category theory, system architecture, graph theory) and follow them all simultaneously looking for connections.<p>Formal languages, automata, and process algebras form a really fundamental mathematical course of study that I&#x27;d highly recommend to anyone interested in &quot;why&quot; CS works. Optimization, matrix analysis/linear algebra, and diffeq form a great basis for simulation and machine learning.<p>Generally, for any of these routes, learn to find your boundary of knowledge. Studying source material is very challenging because any given paper will tend to assume many things about your background. Most of those assumptions will be false and lead to density of the paper. You can often power through without them, but you can also take it as an indication of a new place to study.<p>Finally, see if you can find a study group or journal club. I&#x27;m not there, so I don&#x27;t have firsthand experience, but I&#x27;m sure there are many in the bay area.<p>(Oh, and if you read mathematical papers/books don&#x27;t skip the proofs and exercises.

When addressing an argument about the supposed autism risk of vaccines, both prevalence and severity matter.  If the severity of the effect is so low that these individuals do not present as autistic during normal interaction, then the risks of vaccination compared to the risks of measles/polio/etc. could be considered low despite high prevalence (which as far as anyone knows is not the case anyway).<p>BTW, are you aware what impression people might gain from the the vehemence and narrow focus (missing the broader point) of your response, in a discussion of anything related to the autism spectrum?

This is an elementary, student-level blunder that made it in to the Finder, the center of the user&#x27;s interaction with the system. A lot of people lost a lot of data as this bug remained uncorrected for months. There were similar bugs in Mail, getting IMAP semantics wrong and deleting messages. Anyone who offers an assessment of Apple&#x27;s software quality control at least needs to take this history into account.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are open source projects out there that are just as bad. I don&#x27;t use those. The ones I do use, like mutt, don&#x27;t contain this level of blunder. It&#x27;s not that we should expect software to be free of bugs.

I suspect adverse reactions are under-reported. A recent experience does nothing to dissuade me from that notion. (I know, confirmation bias). But the sheer number of vaccinations that take place would provide some very good data. Of course, that data would also probably show at least some occasional quality control problems with vaccines. No matter how much I may respect the science behind vaccination, I refuse to simply have faith that there are never any QC problems with the mass production of vaccines (or any product for that matter).<p>Our youngest developed a _very_ bad cough in the days/weeks after receiving the DTaP. We called the pediatrician who gave us the standard advice, to monitor the baby and bring her in if it worsened. We later did take the baby in for the cough. The doctor began dissuading us from the idea that it was Pertussis or related to the vaccination, before seeing the baby, and despite local news reports indicating a local increase in Pertussis cases[1]. The doctor had a look at the baby, and told us again it probably wasn&#x27;t Pertussis, everything was normal (except the cough and low grade fever), ran a blood test for Influenza (tests confirmed that it wasn&#x27;t Influenza), and told us to use a humidifier. I asked what the procedure (WRT both treatment and reporting) would be if it had been a possible or suspected vaccine adverse reaction. The doctor said they had _never_ had any reportable cases of vaccine adverse reaction and indicated a general lack of knowledge of adverse event reporting requirements. The clinic where this occurred was right across the street from the hospital that baby was born in, in the Medical Center in Houston, Texas, and is part of a large and well respected practice. Considering the number of patients that clinic has (it is a busy practice, with several clinics), even considering the low expected rate of serious adverse vaccination events, it is not possible that this clinic has never had a reportable event, and very unlikely that there were no serious adverse events. Baby might not have had Pertussis and baby is fine now. But, the experience turned my skepticism into a lack of confidence, at least with that particular clinic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Whooping-cough-on-the-rise-in-Texas-U-S-3851973.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Whooping-cou...</a>",1378571660

These subjects are also not very practical in terms of everyday engineering and on top of that before you even get to that level, a top school would require you to study a bunch of mathematics to gain a certain level of rigor of your thinking. My guess is that this is hard to do on your own.<p>On the other hand, since you have a related degree already and since you know programming, I would heartily recommend you to study on your own combining two approaches: bottom-up to learn the basics and top-down to immediately start increasing your market value and to start opening doors and to keep yourself motivated to go forward with the more tedious study of the basics.<p>E.g. say you are interested in distributed systems - you can start reading up on them (top-down) while digressing here and there to learn some of the basics.<p>Make use of online resources like Coursera for the necessary basics (bottom-up): at least some maths heavy on proofs [1], at least some complexity theory, at least some graph theory, ....<p>I think a purely bottom-up approach (going to a university) could be a waste of time and money in your case.

I bring up Gatto&#x27;s work because his conclusion is more far-reaching and in-depth than what this author wrote about in his article.<p>In any case, according to some of the other comments here, this journalist is less a journalist and more of an author who has done his own research and wrote an extensive book about it. In a way, the article promotes his book, or at least, it promotes his views.<p>Which, if true, would make the failure to cite Gatto&#x27;s book even more interesting. It&#x27;s possible that he did all this in-depth research and wrote a book without having once come across Gatto. I find that unlikely though, but hey, the world&#x27;s a pretty big place. Lots of strange things are possible.<p>Speaking of &quot;ground breaking&quot;, I&#x27;ve been reading something about the education system in ancient Sumer. I am not sure if they had compulsory education in Sumer, but they certainly have a sort of disciplinary-based education system that is eerily similar to our modern one. The connection is described in Gatto&#x27;s book. The US compulsory education system was created and patterned off of the Hindu education system, one where a single upper-caste Brahamin can control a large classroom of lower-caste students. (The implication being, as this author has found out, the US education system is more about control and indoctrination and less about being given the knowledge and rational tools so one can be a free-thinking citizen). There is some interesting evidence that the Hindu people themselves, came out from a Mesopotamia civilization that had itself been derived from the Sumerian high civilization.<p>If <i>that</i> one is true, then we would have been thrashing about with this sort of education system for 6000 years now.

The Art of Computer Programming by Knuth has a lot of the theory included and doesn&#x27;t hold back on the Math.  Similarly, Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein is quite good for the basis of Algorithm theory.<p>That being said, theory plays a small role in everyday development.  If your primary goal is to increase your knowledge as it relates to development you don&#x27;t want to focus on theory until it becomes a pain point.  Algorithm theory helps with scalability, but practice is far more useful to programming.  Conferences in your field that can expose you to new things to learn and different tool chains in your language are valuable.  Learning a new related language can also be valuable you might consider learning iOS and then JavaScript which would let you work on Android, iOS and Cordova (formerly PhoneGap) applications at a level where you&#x27;d be comfortable going from JavaScript to native to write unavailable features.<p>If you&#x27;re happy and have good opportunities on Android, focus on getting a deeper understanding: what are good open source repos, what coding conventions do they use, what frameworks and approaches could you know better. Are there parts of the OS you haven&#x27;t worked with and wanted to?  For instance, I built a demo app for LG designed for in-store promo devices where we hacked around in the OS to intercept the display of screens that would let the user delete apps from the phone and throw up a password lock that would kick them out to the main screen.

Again, be sure to TAKE NOTES or you&#x27;ll forget things using this scattershot approach.<p>It&#x27;ll take a TON of time but if you keep your sessions relatively short, you&#x27;ll get a shallow knowledge of all of the major CS areas quickly, and then you can use your job or natural interest to drive you into going deep on areas that affect or motivate you.<p>I&#x27;m starting an MSc in software engineering later this year but my own CS knowledge has mostly been learned in the above ways (that is, I don&#x27;t have a bachelors in CS).<p><i>Clarification: As cliveowen got me to realize (below), the above approach might not be for you if you have a very specific target in your career development. My experiences and recommendations are specifically around getting a broad level of experience rather than aiming at a specific role (which, perhaps, you should be doing).</i>",1378569954

Since he references the C code sqlite is using (at a quick glance it looks pretty contained) I don&#x27;t know why he doesn&#x27;t just include it directly in his project and call it from objc, no statement API needed.<p>[Edit: I see now that in the test there is only 1 statement object ever created for a test of a million dates.  Better than I thought initially.  But my guess is the statement object still creates some degree of inefficiency not found in directly calling the C version.]<p>7 seconds is a long time in CPU terms, I am sure that he can do better.",1378569945

Eating 3 kB for the tinyUSB stack is annoying.<p>Also, they claim is has &quot;hardware I2C&quot; which is stretching the truth IMO. The USI doesn&#x27;t let you write a fully interrupt driven I2C slave, it is a polled implementation leaving lots of support logic to software.",1378569837

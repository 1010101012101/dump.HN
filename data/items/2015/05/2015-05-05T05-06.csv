Pick your poison: walled garden with crappy devtools, OSS fanatics who will not pay for software in a million years; or warezing pirates. Note that whichever you choose, your app will still end up on torrent sites ~2 days after release anyways.<p>* The cross-OS development tools&#x27; end results are usually sub-pair, even compared with javascript.<p>* Desktop usage is, and has been stagnating for a while now; while mobile usage is growing at an incredible rate. Mobile native market is also highly fragmented.<p>* The lowest common denominator across all of these markets is the web: develop it once using responsive design, run it on everything for at least the next decade, or so.<p>* People have been voting for this platform with their wallets for a while now; specifically by being unable to pirate web apps.<p>* The stakeholders in selling AWS are: developers (for whom command line & APIs are the critical part), and business decision makers (who are looking for easy leverage). Neither target group is particularly interested in desktop apps.<p>* Specifically regarding to their propriatory tech (eg dynamoDB), developing a third-party desktop tool for it is a high-risk-no-reward endavour: you either get traction, in which case Amazon will gladly oblige with an app of their own; or it won&#x27;t, in which case you&#x27;re out with $lots$.<p>Joel Spolsky put it best: &quot;Filling little gaps in another company&#x27;s product lineup is snatching nickels from the path of an oncoming steam roller.&quot; ( <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/06/10c.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/06/10c.html</a> )",1430804942

No-one would stand a chance of coping with such a broad and deep syllabus within the time frame of a degree course, but I worry that the target audience for this list won&#x27;t necessarily realise that and so the current presentation could actually discourage people from studying CS.<p>I think part of the problem is having so much emphasis on specific tools and standards rather than general principles and theory. Hopefully CS students do pick up some familiarity with practical examples along the way, but I don&#x27;t think that should be the priority for undergraduate level CS teaching. I&#x27;m particularly wary of putting so much emphasis on &quot;old school&quot; tools that aren&#x27;t necessarily very good by modern standards but remain popular because of momentum and ecosystem effects.<p>As a result of that emphasis on tools, I&#x27;d say sound theoretical foundations seem to be given less weight than they deserve. Some examples of terms that I would have liked to see on any modern undergraduate CS syllabus or reading list are &quot;comparison sort&quot;, &quot;halting problem&quot;, &quot;ACID&quot;, &quot;transaction&quot;, &quot;distributed system&quot;, &quot;CAP theorem&quot;, &quot;concurrency&quot;, &quot;deadlock&quot;, and &quot;lock-free&quot;, as well as a lot more specifics on basic data structures and algorithms.",1430803605

Luckily for us (ok, not just luck), we are using ES to index Hadoop (both HDFS and YARN), and we are using MySQL Cluster as our source of truth. For HDFS, we create logging tables that store mutations to inodes and we have a program that transactionally periodically pulls mutation batches and applies to the ES. Failures means ES falls behind but we have no data loss.
For YARN, however, we just want to index recent stats - what containers are being allocated right now to which apps. So, we use the streaming Event API for MySQL Cluster (native C++ api) that we push into ES. Failures mean lost data, but we get near instaneous updates in ES, which is crucial as it is used as part of an interactive service (monitor YARN applicaion progress).",1430802841

A lot of the content, especially the focus on algorithms, seems really interesting to me.<p>Straight out of high school I did not have the math grades for CS so I went to the American equivalent of community college and am on track to get a diploma from an IT related course thats basically going to amount to a web dev job in the future. If I decided to go that route for lets say 5 years to save some money would it be a hindrance career wise, because of a large time gap in the resume, to take the 4 years off to get a CS degree from a decent school, say Waterloo?<p>The biggest point of fear is that I would not be able to complete the degree and realizing it was to above my cognitive abilities.",1430802351

Maybe no animal like that has been found. Or maybe it could be done with another type, but no such animals exist - so do you say there is another type or not?",1430802290

Maybe in a few years.<p>I think a few of the points could be expanded. For example &#x27;Robotics&#x27; gives the wrong impression and I&#x27;d say that you can get a lot of conceptual bang for your buck just from understanding the operation of basic electronics components like capacitors. It&#x27;s not necessarily &#x27;computer science&#x27; in the strict definition but being able to get an idea of how electronics and hardware items work is frankly more powerful than some of the items on this list like being able to make pretty visualizations.<p>Moreover, in that long list of cool languages, not a single one was a scripting language like Ruby, Perl or Python. Having one of these in your toolkit is pretty much essential and it feels like a glaring omission.",1430802075

I&#x27;m sure there are exceptions, but I have not come across any.<p>It&#x27;s a sign of a tutorial programmer (not exactly), maybe, more or a copy/paste programmer, who finds &quot;blocks&quot; of code that work, and just apply it everywhere.<p>They tend to lack the deep fundamentals of how html works.",1430802013

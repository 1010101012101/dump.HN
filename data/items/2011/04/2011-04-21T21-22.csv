2472546,story,,,1,3,phlux,"Why Thomas Watson was right.",,"Head of IBM, Thomas Watson, is famously quoted as saying that ""I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,"" -- while the veracity of the quote may be in question, it may in fact be largely true.<p>As all things do, the computing industry operates in cycles. We have seen the original monolithic machines used in the past for trajectory calculations grow, become big blue mainframes and shrink again to minis, the PC and now our mobile devices.<p>Currently, the computing powers of our civilization have fractured into millions of devices, billions of processors and trillions of transactions.<p>The sales channels and profits from the various big vendors are mind boggling and competition is fierce and a joy to behold.<p>But this is now.<p>Mr. Watson's quote (we'll just go ahead and give him credit, regardless), that there is only a market for <i>maybe</i> 5 computers was just 75 to 100 years too early... and lacked detail.<p>Cycles. The industry operates in cycles - everything is fractal. The big bang of our industry showered the planet in bits - thought, information, ideas, math, technology.... life quickly changing the fabric of humanity permanently. In a very short time, our world has changed - from Watson's piano peddling to farmers just a generation or so ago, through his leadership at IBM to now having the ability nearly instantly hear the last tweets of a celebrated director before his demise in a war torn region of the globe most of us would otherwise never think about.<p>The vast explosion of available technology upon the globe, and our lives looks massive, wide, diverse. So many different and varying options -- different colors, speed, screen sizes etc... there are literally too many options to pick from.<p>We form factions around the implementations we like, build entire businesses and careers on our choice and preference of design.<p>But in the end, we are all fighting over singular components. Not systems, not computers - but sensors.<p>The real value in everything we do, as an industry, and ultimately as a race and civilization, is in the data. The information. The creation, development and manifestation of our thoughts and knowledge.<p>Our relationships with one another, further our ability to communicate - digitally rebuild the tower of babel.<p>To these ends, we are seeing a collapsing of computing. The scale, complexity, power and capabilities growing, as Moore predicted, into perpetuity - but the <i>idea</i> of computing is collapsing again.<p>Collapsing to make Mr. Watson not only right, but prophetic.<p>In less than 10 years, we have seen a tiny online bookseller and a DVD mail-rental service literally redefine and set the direction for the entire industry.<p>Certainly, like today's outage, there are issues. But those are human issues; our design was wrong, our implementation had faults, something failed somewhere which caused a brief outage which seemed massive at the time - but in the larger picture is but a minor growing pain on the path towards the singularity.<p>Right now, we see the path for the current titans of our industry as they battle to maintain their dominance - but in the next ten to twenty years, the landscape will be exactly as Watson predicted.<p><i>Maybe</i> five major computers. Each with trillions of sensors - all providing utility to their hundreds of millions of users.<p>Layer upon layer, built up in a global representation of the OSI - but even that model lacks enough layers to now accurately describe the scale and complexity of the worlds major compute powers.<p>The major computers of the world will be the future iterations of facebook, google, amazon, microsoft and apple.<p>These will be the physical computing behemoths upon which 90% of our digital existence will be built.<p>Entire cities of nodes, components, little bits of the digital fractal that has become the outward expression of all human informational consciousness - continually receiving updates via the trillions of sensors carried by every person and thing in the world.<p>These several ultra-compute-platforms will host the myriad of layered services and applications that are required for modern civilizations existence, providing us with seamless access to every bit we require from mundane to sublime.<p>They themselves will become even more interwoven, relying on each others services, infrastructure and users to survive.<p>Take a step back, abstract yourself from the seemingly separate nature of our reality. The device in front of you is not standalone. It never was, and it never could be. It is simply a component of a much larger, way more complex representation of its idea.<p>In years times, we may again find dear Watson was wrong. There was never a market for maybe five computers -- there is really only a market for one, but that one will be built supported and used through innumerable lenses represented by countless companies all building a tiny piece of a giant, global, single machine.<p>---<p>(First draft, stream of conscious inspired by todays Amazon outage.)",1303422820

I'd tend toward `pure JS' view of the JS engine; excluding DOM document and DOM events. [0]<p>Measuring speed of `naked, bare' JS engine makes some sense, even if not directly for web developers and web users. As some other posters pointed out, JS itself may be used for server-side scripting or general data processing, where access to DOM may be irrelevant. Just raw JS and some custom API for I/O.<p>However, I don't trust this method of benchmarking fully. There are optimization techniques that may skew results quite a bit. I guess dead code optimization could end up taking whole loops out of JSLint's code, if there are no side effects. That was implicated in discussions about some earlier benchmarks by other authors.<p>----<p>[0] Not sure if it makes a strong case, but here goes: when Apple forked Konqueror's KHTML into WebKit, they used own JS engine instead of KJS.",1303422783

Anyone who has been around AWS (or basically any technology) will agree that the things that can really hurt you are not always the things you considered in your design. I just can't believe that many of the people who grok the cloud were running production sites under the assumption that there was no cross-AZ risk. They use the same API endpoints, auth, etc so it's obvious they're integrated at some level.<p>Perhaps for Quora and the like, engineering for the amount of availability needed to withstand this kind of event was simply not cost effective, but I seriously doubt the possibility didn't occur to them. It's not even obvious to me that there are many people who did follow the contract you reference who had serious downtime. All of the cases I've read about so far have been architectures that were not robust to a single AZ failure.<p>As for multi-az RDS, it's synchronous MySQL replication on what smell like standard EC2 instances, probably backed by EBS.

2472461,comment,2470865,2471386,4,0,jerf,,,"Let me summarize the argument against using network filesystems. Elsewhere on the HN homepage as I write this [1] there is a link to the Wikipedia article on the Fallacies of Distributed Computing [2], which are:<p><pre><code>    1. The network is reliable.
    2. Latency is zero.
    3. Bandwidth is infinite.
    4. The network is secure.
    5. Topology doesn't change.
    6. There is one administrator.
    7. Transport cost is zero.
    8. The network is homogeneous.
</code></pre>
<i>Technically</i>, every one of them is a myth of local disk storage as well, inasmuch as nothing is every 100% reliable in the mathematical sense. In reality, unlike network programming where the moment you step out into the big world you are slammed in the face by the mythical nature of these claims, they are <i>true enough</i> for when you are working with local disk that you can write significant programs as if they are true, excepting perhaps latency (busy disk may mean you get scheduled much later). The basic argument is the practical differences are so significant that where the file interface is most effective when it just pretends most of the myths are true because adding the complexity of being able to deal with violations isn't worth it (and most programmers using local disk would get it wrong even if you offered it; how many programs gracefully handle running out of disk space, let alone more bizarre failure cases?), the network <i>must</i> give you the tools to handle those issues, and correspondingly <i>must</i> have a more complicated API.<p>In particular, every time you so much as touch the network, you need a code path to handle the possibility that the network communication utterly failed, just disappeared into oblivion. You just don't code that way when you deal with files; the file may be gone, the disk may run out of space, but you don't sit there in the middle of a fast read loop and handle <i>failure</i> on every read, such as a topology change, i.e., ""the disk drive is no longer present"". That's not because it's not possible, because you can certainly yank out a USB key mid-read, but you tend not to handle it in most userland code. In fact the OS won't even let you handle many failures, as it will either abstract away the retries or simply lock your userspace hard.<p>So the fundamental idea is that filesystem abstractions built for relatively reliable communication simply isn't correct for network communication.<p>Incidentally, the same argument can pretty much be made against remote RPC by simply replacing ""disk access"" with ""function call"". You do not have to guard every function call you make with a check for absolute failure. (Not the function returning failure or the function throwing an exception, but the function that may have been there two minutes ago unexpectedly being <i>entirely gone</i>.) RPC may look cute in the source code but it's the wrong layer of abstraction.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2470865"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2470865</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacies_of_Distributed_Comput...</a>",1303421124

This means it doesn't require as much refined sugar compared to sugar from fruit in order for your liver to spend some time with a dangerous fructose load;<p>-Refined- sugars are -especially- problematic, because of the absorption pattern.

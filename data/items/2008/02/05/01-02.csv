But for example for a free service or during a beta period it's perfectly reasonable""<p>So you think that users will go through the trouble of installing a new browser to see a free website or a product in beta? Good luck with that...<p>It seems to me that a lot of really good programmers (of which you seem to be one, judging from your comments) don't mingle a lot with ""normal"" people. These are the ones that have normal lives, use their computer only as a tool that is expected to just work, and use IE because it came with the computer.<p>And they are the ones that will pay for products. Early adopters are a really hard crowd to make money from, they expect everything to be free, and they will move on as soon as something more exciting comes along.<p>I would never launch a product, not even in a beta, that only works in firefox, Not only do you lose more than half of your potential customers, but it also sends a signal that either you are not very good at what you do since you only seem to be able to make it work in one browser, or else that you don't much care. Both are pretty bad.",1202175926

109454,comment,109360,109422,0,0,greendestiny,,,"I actually considered doing the web application I'm doing at the moment as firefox only, purely because it heavily relied on SVG. It's very much a niche market where my competitors are desktop applications, and it will be a fairly expensive subscription service so it didn't seem unreasonable to demand users download firefox.<p>Eventually though I just came to realise that the biggest advantage of the web was the ability to have anyone come to my site and be ready to use the product. So in the end I've gone with flash.",1202175346
109453,comment,109354,109451,0,0,curi,,,"The distinction between ""theories"" which aren't proven true, and facts which are, is false. Nothing is proven true in an ultimate, certain sense.<p>That isn't important. But not because if something seems to work a bunch of times (how many?) then it's true. That isn't a way forward. The way forward is to focus on what the best available explanation is, and to improve it through criticism.",1202175316

109451,comment,109354,109408,0,0,webnrrd2k,,,"Well, yes, theories are never proven true in any ultimate sense. But it explains how people work rather well.<p>If a theory works time and again to explain something then, eventually, it's considered proven. For example, Newtonian physics/gravity isn't strictly correct true, but it still useful. It works to explain things well enough that it's pretty much the only model 99% of the world will ever need, and, in that sense, it's considered true.",1202175072

Cutting cables is not fundamentally difficult -- they are not even armored below a certain depth. It would also be a very expensive, complicated, and potentially embarrassing test.",1202174363

What percentage of tech bloggers of note use IE?<p>Assuming your v1 test is successful and it's time to ""cross the chasm"", of course, IE is a must.<p>If you'd like a little data thrown in, our userbase (after being on TechCrunch twice and LifeHacker 3 times in the last few months) is only 21% IE.",1202174219
109444,comment,108794,109353,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"""Have you ever been prevented from doing something you wanted to because of patents?""<p>1. Every year at CMU's Human Computer Interaction Institute, it appears someone reinvents something patented though not deployed by Xerox PARC.<p>An example is a ""looking glass"" feature for something like photoshop, where you can preview the result of an action like a filter -- or something like that.<p>From the anecdotes I've heard, PARC just sits on it, doesn't deploy or license it, and acts to block others from using it.<p>2. SIFT is a new object recognition technique built upon years of research. A recent patent on the best implementation has restricted groups from using the techniques. They grant exclusive licenses on the level of ""for all robots in America"", but that's pretty useless for a startup, isn't it?<p>I'll say it: nothing should be patented. Trade secrets, in the literal and legal sense, make much more sense. If a system can be reverse engineered and copied, you don't have a secret, and it isn't in the best interest of society to block copy cats from beating the originator.<p>The idea that makers wouldn't create due to the fear of competition is just wrong -- though it is the most often used argument to defend patents.<p>[edit: And another thing: people respect and fear patents, so despite my opinions, I'm going to act in my best interest to acquire any patents possible on my work. My goal is notably against the best interest of society as a whole: create unfair advantages for my company.]",1202173913

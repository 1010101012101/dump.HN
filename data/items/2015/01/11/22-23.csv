None of my colleagues that I surveyed in my previous (big) company was supportive of those. Trade unions of old used to fight for better working conditions and what are they to fight for in the likes of Google? Better phones for Christmas? That may be an argument until for one reason or another you run foul of your boss or some awkward company policy and then you&#x27;re completely alone.

I would love to know techniques for dealing stress, mundane work environments, and not being challenged.<p>I was involved in a startup for a year that ended early last year because the person funding it got cold feet - it was his idea. As a result, I basically took the first job I could find, which is in the finance industry. My roles to date have largely been around management of people and architecture.<p>My home town is literally at the bottom end of Australia. Beautiful place but there are very few development jobs and no paying startups here.<p>I have a child with another on the way. My partners salary is insufficient for us to live on.<p>My job is a dev at a medium size company (around 300). The development in this company is appalling, non scoring on the Joel test and the work is boring. There is no challenge, people play games on their phone and sleep all day. The managers are micromanagers and the developers sit at the bottom of the org chart (this is a software company).<p>I&#x27;m building a cool product out of work, but I&#x27;m at it alone and I fear that someone will beat me to market (trying for bare minimum viable product). I also fear burn out (has happened before), the company attempting to invoke its IP clause of contract when they find out (legal advice has been that they have no ground).<p>I&#x27;m working 8h a day in my day job and 5-6h a night on the startup. I take weekends off to spend time with the family.<p>I have a deep understanding and portfolio of experience across mainframe development, enterprise Java, .NET, mobile apps & web development. I need something that challenges me - moving is off the cards due to baby #2 & I doubt selling remote work (if I can find a reliable income stream) to my partner.<p>For those who have been in similar situations: how did you manage and balance everything?",1421017125

8871615,comment,8870934,8870934,0,0,tomlock,,,"I think startups can be romanticized so I&#x27;m sharing my startup story and some of the things I did do and some of the things I should have done.<p>When I was 23 I joined a startup as employee number 4.  We did Salesforce implementations for small businesses using freelancers.  At the time it was the CEO, Director of Sales, and another Project manager.  I was originally hired as an admin assistant but after I taught the other project manager what a Gantt chart was, the company decided I was ready for the big time.<p>The company eventually fell apart due to internal conflict.  The CEO had already started another successful web design company during his teens.  He was extremely driven, charismatic, and caring, (and better than me in almost all the ways that count) but he did seem to have lost <i>something</i> due to working so hard for so long.  The director of Sales was an absolute beast at what he did well, which was sales.  Our pipeline was always bursting, but the customers expectations were often for things that were technically impossible (integrating Salesforce with Outlook at the time was terrible).  He was clinging on to a fading dream of entrepreneurship.  He didn&#x27;t talk about his past, but he had worked in enterprise, and started his own business, but he hadn&#x27;t reached the parabolic heights that he&#x27;d hoped for.  The PM (project manager) was a friend of mine, and a friend of the CEO.  He was extremely smart, but sometimes an idealist, and at the time not a very experienced negotiator.<p>I started at the company because I had been working at a big business that didn&#x27;t offer me full-time work.  Straight out of university I needed a job, so I&#x27;d have quick cash.  I had an Arts degree and just wanted anything to start, so I took what I could get.  They had me on as a temp, and I was fearful.  I wanted security and one of the ways I saw to get it was to threaten to leave, so I put out my feelers, and the PM answered.  My boss at the time couldn&#x27;t put me on, and even if he&#x27;d said he would, I probably would have left for the startup.  I figured, it could be the next Facebook.<p>At the interview, the Sales guy grilled me, but one of my strong points is interviews, so I nailed it.  I even asked for more money, and I got it!  At the time, I didn&#x27;t ask a question which I should have:<p>1) Ask the founders why they need another employee<p>Hell, this probably wouldn&#x27;t have changed my answer to their offer, but at the time they were looking for relief.  The PM was overworked, and they needed him supported.  In retrospect, they didn&#x27;t know what they wanted.  I kind of wanted an assistant role, and at the time didn&#x27;t know I wasn&#x27;t the best at project management, but that&#x27;s what I ended up doing.  I think in most startups the original employees don&#x27;t have much choice - they do what needs doing.  Find out what that is so you know what to expect.<p>I also did one thing well:<p>2) Have a realistic discussion about money<p>I asked for more money than they had offered in my interview.  You should already know what the startup does, and you should have a fair idea of how cash poor or rich they are.  This became even more important for me later.  However, don&#x27;t assume because you&#x27;re working for a startup that you need to get paid nothing.  Startups fail, and if that happens all you&#x27;re going to have in your pocket is the cash.  Trading experience for food is a little less convenient.<p>I started working. It was hard and I was in the deep end.  I bought some experience to the table that they didn&#x27;t have at that point, and I got my first sales experience, which I hated.  I hated project management less, but what I really loved doing was development.  For the work we were doing, development was quite light.  The hours were long, and we hired devs, predominantly in India, to do configuration.  The projects stretched out, often because I hadn&#x27;t communicated with the customers well enough, and because the customer&#x27;s expectations were not aligned with ours/reality.<p>3) Understand the customer<p>We were working for small businesses.  This meant that a small amount of money meant a lot to the customer.  The level of technical understanding of the customers was also low, which could be either extremely positive (importing csvs sounds complex and don&#x27;t worry if it takes a month) or extremely negative (why can&#x27;t you spell check e-mail addresses automatically).  Additionally, in the end we were working for Salesforce.  They didn&#x27;t care how long it took us, they wanted the customer satisfied so they could get that sweet monthly SaaS payment on into the future. All this lead to extremely drawn-out projects, because that&#x27;s what our customers demanded.  That meant long hours, and lots of anger.<p>4) Understand the competition<p>I think this was the most crucial thing I didn&#x27;t do.  In the small business space for Salesforce, companies rise and fall all the time.  I think this is due to the volatility of the customer type.  It seems like the success strategy for companies in the space is to move to the medium-customer segment, effectively leaving the small businesses behind.  I honestly have no idea if that was our strategy, but I probably wouldn&#x27;t have joined the company if I&#x27;d realized how fraught with risk our market was.  I even had another friend who had worked in the space, and shut down their company.  In the end our competitive advantage seemed to only be how high our customer&#x27;s expectations were in the sales pipeline.<p>5) Evaluate perks versus effort<p>If something goes wrong and you have to work until 3AM (and it will and you will), a bottle of expensive vodka is still less expensive than your hourly wage would have been.  Is an office pet and an open bar worth the time you&#x27;re spending at the office?  Ask yourself this question often, because you&#x27;ll be spending a lot of time at work.<p>At this point the pipeline was getting totally stuffed with old projects that had been drawn out for months because we couldn&#x27;t deliver on our promises.  Our desire and need for new deposits still grew, however, and so the pressure continued to build.  The sales director was restless with this.  I had been so excited at the beginning of the company to help design our processes, but we continually revisited and redesigned them, so much so that I think we went through 4 different visual designs for customer quotes in the 6 months I was there.  I didn&#x27;t think this was normal, and I felt like we needed more stability.<p>6) Remember that X% of $0 is $0<p>As the company became more fraught with drama, all the non-founders (there were now 6 in the company) were offered equity in the company.  The first issue with this was that the company was surrounded by a bunch of other companies with different names, so we had no idea where the money was going.  The second issue was this was a verbal agreement from the sales director.  At this point I decided to leave the company.<p>I don&#x27;t think there were any other lessons to learn, and I think I came out of the experience as a better person.  If I&#x27;d turned down the offer I&#x27;d probably be reading Hacker News all starry eyed thinking startups were the promised land.  They aren&#x27;t, but they are fun, and I&#x27;d recommend everyone try them.  But, protect yourself.  Ensure you know what you are getting, and be realistic about the outcome at all times.  If you are living hand-to-mouth as a college grad, don&#x27;t rely on a successful exit as your savings plan.<p>In the end, I went crawling back to my old boss, but he hired me full time without an interview, and offered me more money!  Taking into account my unpaid overtime, I got a 100% pay rise :).  I was hurt by the experience, and the startup had threatened to call the cops if I didn&#x27;t return my laptop and phone on the day I left, but looking back on it now, what a laugh!  I felt taken advantage of, but I got valuable sales experience, learnt more about working with external devs (although I&#x27;m still not great at it), a chance to design processes for a company from the ground up, a better nose for bullshit and a few expensive bottles of vodka!  It was an exhausting six months.<p>After I left, the founding CEO got f@#ked out of the company by the sales director, and then the sales director got f@#cked out of the company by the new CEO.  The equity never materialized.  The best story is of the other PM, who managed to score two medium-size enterprise clients for himself, and now earns six figures and works only a few days a week!",1421015894

8871604,comment,8871453,8871453,0,0,lvh,,,"ASN.1 is a bit unfortunate. On the one hand, I want to believe: it&#x27;s a fairly ubiquitous standard (at least, as long as you&#x27;re dealing with cryptography or a handful of other specific fields), and it&#x27;s true that it can be a lot more compact than JSON or XML (see below), and it&#x27;s even occasionally faster. However:<p>1. A lot of ASN.1 software is pretty buggy and undermaintained.  How do I submit a bug to pyasn1? Because it&#x27;s entrenched in libraries three or four layers below what most developers will see, it&#x27;s also difficult to replace.<p>2. Faster and more compact depends on the encoding rules. Let&#x27;s talk about the dozen or so different ways you have of encoding ASN.1. BER? DER? Maybe CER? XER? Why not both: CXER! I&#x27;m missing a bunch, I know.<p>3. The performance and network arguments ignore what you can do with compressed verbose formats like JSON, XML or EDN. lz4 is <i>magic</i>. Even totally ubiquitous gz compression works extraordinarily well.<p>4. While ASN.1 messages do contain descriptions of what types they contain (e.g., you can see that there&#x27;s a bit string coming), they aren&#x27;t self-describing in the same way that JSON or XML are, which is quite annoying for debugging. You can make self-describing messages using XML, but at that point you&#x27;re literally just doing XML. Good luck finding software that lets you easily use whichever you like -- even if you subscribe to the notion that easy debuggability doens&#x27;t matter for production messages, in which case I strongly disagree.<p>5. I&#x27;d harp about its extensibility, but it&#x27;s really no better than JSON, so I won&#x27;t.<p>All-in-all, I&#x27;m compressing some EDN, and I&#x27;m pretty happy.",1421015555

What now we call &quot;short term investments&quot; will become very very short terms, and so on. There&#x27;s nothing that will be distructed on this side in my opinion.<p>What could lead to problems (that is: a not changing social and political situation) would be the adaption of political mechanism for the longer lifespans. For example, now politicians have mandate that last from 3 to 5 years, then there are elections (talking about not totalitary states). Putting this in prospective, with humans having a 1000+ years lifespan, politicians mandate would grow to 50+ years. That&#x27;s bad, and in my opinion will only lead to deadlocks.<p>Imagine a nation guided for 50+ years by the same persons.

I&#x27;m not sure of his political affiliation and if he was pro-regime or not (the regime at that time was undoubtedly evil), but the way of writing about the tragedy really struck a chord, so it is very relevant. The civilian casualty reports of the attack itself range between 489 and 528[2].<p>I was only 2 when the the NATO air invasion on Serbia started. At that time, me and my parents were living in a remote town in Eastern Serbia and the main targets were elsewhere. However, there was a factory of chemical compounds near us that was rather high-profile, and they announced it will be targeted soon, so as a precaution we fled to a nearby afer village where my grandparents lived then. They say you usually don&#x27;t remember anything before the age of three, but there is one picture that I strongly believe came from there. We were all in a basement, with some other people, crammed, and I think I remember the sound of sirens or faint explosions somewhere, but maybe that&#x27;s just a fake memory. I remember an old, broken fridge in the corner, and when I talked to my parents about this, they say that they remembered the same old fridge in that basement that day.<p>Only later, when I grew up, I heard the stories of the Radio Television of Serbia building being bombed and the circumstances surrounding it. I don&#x27;t know enough facts to know if that media outlet was censored and manipulated, or if the director knew that the building will be targeted and left the journalists there to be sacrificed so the regime could use that event for propaganda later. But it doesn&#x27;t matter in the end. All I know is that people died---journalists who probably just did their job. Journalists who had to be protected, but were instead hung out to dry. The media was most probably censored (that&#x27;s my perspective from today, but again I don&#x27;t know most of the facts), but I doubt that any of them had any say in that. The ones who were responsible are higher-up officials.<p>Those were not the only civilians who died, as mentioned before. For instance, my high school bears a memorial engraving in memory of an 18-year-old student who died when a bridge collapsed near Varvarin[2].<p>The Yugoslav people from then never had any hate for anyone. It was amidst a huge crisis and they mostly wanted just a better life. We were led by a psychopathic leader who brought incidents like the killing of those journalists and all these civilians. Somehow my country has never succeeded in avoiding evil.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to belittle other incidents. All human deaths are scary and sad. I am scared and sad when hearing about the Charlie Hebdo incident. But it&#x27;s hardly an isolated case. It seems to happen all the time, and people should be more aware---maybe then, there is a chance of some change in the world for the better.<p>And a small digression: I remember that PG, in a heavily technical essay that I really liked, mentioned something rather political about Yugoslavia and freedom for people&#x27;s homelands. Such a political sentiment felt really out of place, so I wrote to him about it---I never got a reply, but that&#x27;s completely understandable and beside my point here.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://globalresearch.ca/articles/MAR304A.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://globalresearch.ca/articles/MAR304A.html</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/Natbm200-01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/Natbm200-01.htm</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://emperors-clothes.com/misc/nota.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emperors-clothes.com/misc/nota.htm</a>",1421015280

(Appeal to authority) Until very recently, I&#x27;ve worked for years at a huge and very successful distributed systems company. There wasn&#x27;t a single system using the actor model I ran into. I haven&#x27;t heard anyone advocating for the actor model. Everything was a service with an RPC interface. At least one other huge competitor is well known for a service-oriented revolution phase.<p>B. (Unsubstantiated anecdote). The majority of advocacy around Actors I&#x27;ve come across lacks substance. There is very little exemplification of what problems are solved or comparison to other ways to solve the problem. But it&#x27;s almost guaranteed to have an appeal to Erlang&#x27;s authority thrown somewhere in there. The OP is a canonical example.<p>C. (Concrete example, you can start calling me out on it). Speaking of actors, messaging and distributed systems, I just don&#x27;t get what&#x27;s the point of sending an unreliable message if you don&#x27;t check the response and tailor your reactions based on it. Which is basically doing RPCs. How do you even test something like &quot;endpoint.send(request)&quot; when messages can get lost?!<p>Sorry if I sound harsh and unfair.

If you want a record (&quot;issue type&quot;) called &quot;Epic&quot; it is easy to configure JIRA to have it. It is also easy - for some definition of easy! - to customise the data you collect for these records (&quot;fields&quot;), when that data is displayed (&quot;screens&quot;), and the lifecycle through which it will progress (&quot;workflow&quot;).<p>However!<p>Most people want to use Epics as part of an Agile methodology, and Atlassian provides a batteries-included solution called &quot;JIRA Agile&quot;. If you saw an &#x27;activate to enable Epics&#x27; button it was almost certainly for JIRA Agile (previously GreenHopper) though I don&#x27;t recall seeing this button myself. JIRA Agile is nice for many reasons, even for people who don&#x27;t follow an Agile methodology, IMO primarily because it provides a simpler user experience for many people - most installations I&#x27;ve seen have it.<p>Stash itself is a fairly well targeted piece of software. It manages git repositories, and provides tools to help with that and integrate with external systems. Provisioning projects->repositories->branches and the permissions around them, pull requests, forks, hooks, automations, and integrations. It&#x27;s also fairly easy to extend with add-ons from the marketplace or that you have written yourself.<p>The integration between Stash and JIRA is good, but is not much more than showing branches, pull requests, and commits that a JIRA issue has been referenced in.<p>Hope that helps",1421014948

There&#x27;s a very small amount of support needed for the &quot;Rust runtime&quot;, including things like stack guards, but it&#x27;s much smaller than it was.<p>The RFC describing the changes is [^1] and the actual commit that finalized them is [^2].<p>[^1]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/230</a><p>[^2]: <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0efafac398ff7f28c5f0fe756c15b9008b3e0534"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/0efafac398ff7f28c5f...</a>",1421014191

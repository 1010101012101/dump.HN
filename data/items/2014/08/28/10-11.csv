In fact, I&#x27;ll go farther and say I misspoke, raising the objection you rightly criticize when it would make more sense to object to using UTF-8 to compare english text to chinese text. I have no issues with your comment, though, and I agree that under compression is the correct place to make the comparison. It&#x27;s faintly aggravating to me that the same text compresses differently according to the intermediate encoding, but that&#x27;s between me and the universe.<p>English can be comfortably expressed in 5 bits per character, using 26 letters and the five symbols [. &#x27;,&quot;] . Capitalization and numeric digits are nice-to-haves. ;)",1409220595

They are identical, except that the 0s and 1s are switched in both books.<p>Now you give one of the books to a space traveller, who gets on a rocket that will take him 10 light years away from Earth. You also agree, that once he is there, both you and him will look at your respective books and look at the same time and it&#x27;s value. So he goes away, and then when the time comes, you open your book, look at the time and read it&#x27;s value - it&#x27;s 1, so that means that his book must say 0. Now, there is no &quot;transfer&quot; of information involved - you have not communicated with someone 10 light years away. The information was encoded in the book when it was created, not when you read the information. The same with quantum entanglement - it&#x27;s already decided when the particle is created,not when you look at it - so it doesn&#x27;t matter how far the particles are apart, you are just reading pre-defined information.<p>Edit: no, I am not a physicist either, but I read this explanation somewhere and I think it explains it fairly well.",1409220398

From their investment in Uber, their robot vehicle projects, their buying spree for robotics companies to their crazy balloon internet service - it all points to one thing. In the future Google want us to stop owning cars, stop travelling in cars as much, and to be able to live and work anywhere and still get all the things we rely on our cars for. That includes short trips to the store, and that is what GSX replaces.<p>Even if Google lose a couple of billion dollars a year subsidising delivery and taxi services for the next decade, the eventual payoff will make it worthwhile.<p>Put simply, Google has enough money, and consequently enough time, to build a service that replaces the multi-trillion dollar individual-owner car industry.",1409220200

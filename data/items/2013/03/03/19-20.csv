Things like built-in maps, slices, multiple returns, lambda functions, channels, goroutines... these are all things you <i>can</i> accomplish in C, but it's so much more painful (see: homebrewed hashtables, do-it-yourself pointer management on a big array, returning structs, function pointers, some sort of mutex abomination to replicate channels, pthreads)",1362340699

Go encourages simple code. Clever code is almost always bad. It's hard to understand and easy to screw up. For example,  at work we had a bug in production for 5 years that short circuited our authorization code because of an incorrectly written ternary statement. If the author had written a simple if statement, the error would have been blindingly obvious. It should have been caught by tests, but due to how the tests were written, that particular path never got called.",1362340684

5315006,comment,5313918,5314496,5,0,burntsushi,,,"> no, interfaces are not a replacement for templates, they are a replacement for abstract base classes<p>Interfaces aren't a replacement for templates, but they aren't a replacement for abstract base classes either. Interfaces in Go provide polymorphism through structural sub-typing. My limited knowledge of abstract base classes says that these are very much <i>not</i> the same.<p>> Someone who is familiar enough with Haskell, ML, or Scala, will dislike the fact that Go practically ignored (or rejected?) two or three decades of research an programming languages. From the perspective of PL research, Go is a weak language.<p>I am a Haskell programmer, but that crowd is impossible to please unless you've provided every PL feature out of research in the last few decades. I've seen virtually no appreciation for simplicity of language design as an entire unit.<p>> If there is a new imperative language that does interest them, it is probably Rust.<p>Yes. I can't wait for Rust to get a bit more love in the documentation department. Pattern matching? Algebraic data types? Thread local storage? Type classes? Yes please! Where do I sign up?<p>> The question is, who does switch to Go? One would guess that these are mostly Python and Ruby programmers who have never written much C, C++, or Haskell, and are looking for something faster and compiled. Yes, this is a generalization, and there are plenty of exceptions. Not exactly the 'Python paradox', 'better than the rest', programmers.<p>In my experience, most Go programmers are in fact coming from Python and Ruby.<p>The premise of the ""Go"" or ""Python"" paradox is that skilled programmers tend to be the first ones to adopt new languages. Then the less-skilled programmers follow when there is sufficient buzz. I think that if one accepts that premise, it is applicable for Go.<p>> one of my personal pet peeves are people claiming that 'Go interfaces are like Haskell typeclasses'<p>That is annoying, but completely understandable. They are deceptively similar on the surface. But I don't think this kind of confusion is unique to Go. You'll see it everywhere.<p>You know what else people confuse? That Go interfaces are just like abstract base classes! :P<p>> But if you look at the language spec, there is not much interesting.<p>That's kind of the point. If you don't accept the overall simplicity of the design Go as a feature, then I can't blame you if you dismiss Go. If all you want to judge a language by is whether it includes cool and exciting new features, then Go will <i>never</i> be a good choice for you a priori.<p>> Go is just a very boring language (which isn't necessarily bad), pretty much like Java, without the good package management (no versioning)<p>I am utterly baffled. Go's approach to packaging is literally the best tool of its class that I've ever used. The Go tool militates toward convention rather than providing a dizzying array of features. This makes it strictly less powerful than other packaging tools, but god dammit, it makes it dead simple to install packages.<p>You want to try my window manager, which is roughly 30,000 LOC (including my X libraries)? If you have Go installed: `go get github.com/BurntSushi/wingo`. That's it. You're done. I just ran it on my system, and it downloaded, compiled and installed my window manager---along with all of its dependencies---in less than 30 seconds.<p>You might say---other build tools can do this! But do you know how many lines of configuration I had to write for any of this to work? None. I didn't specify dependencies. No strange command line flags. Nothing. The common case Just Works.<p>> Goroutines are nice, but they are just green threads. Channels have been done elsewhere.<p>This is a vast understatement. Just green threads? And please, tell me, what other mainstream language supports green threads? I know Haskell and Erlang do. Rust will (yay). Anything else? No? (I know Java doesn't, but I can't remember if this is a limitation of the JVM or if Scala or Clojure have green threads). Go does. That's a pretty big deal. Go makes a solid concurrent style of programming in a C-like language virtually free. Sure, everything is still mutable, but there are powerful idioms that---in my experience---militate against race conditions. It's not as good as Haskell/Erlang/Rust in the compile time safety department, but I'll be damned if it isn't loads easier than my other choices: C, C++, Java, Python, Ruby, Lua, blah blah.<p>> Boring languages attract more mediocre programmers than great programmers.<p>And close minded folk think they have all the answers. It's possible for people to enjoy using more than one tool. I'm a hacker, and I love good tools. Go is a great tool. So is Haskell. I hope that Rust will be.",1362340317

But I like being able to get up and walk around every now and then without interrupting my workflow.<p>Thing is, it's cloud technology (Dropbox, gmail, etc.) that makes it all possible.

5314903,comment,5311361,5312243,1,0,gruseom,,,"It's happened to me in real life. When you want to go from keeping a value in external storage to keeping it in memory, you've gone from async to sync. The reverse happens too. These are not huge conceptual changes. When they require restructuring an entire program, it's reasonable to wonder why that program's structure is so brittle. ""Likely make them async even if you don't know, just in case"" sounds to me like an admission of this problem. Why would I want to make an in-memory lookup async, thus forcing it to wait in the event queue and defeating the purpose of RAM? The only reason to do that is that the programming model imposes a large complexity tax for not doing it.<p>Consider the simple case where one wants to look up a value synchronously if one has it in memory, and go get it from storage asynchronously if one doesn't. That's a natural thing to want, but it's problematic in Node. The problem is not syntacticyou can easily write a function that calls back immediately in the one case and asynchronously in the other. It's that sync and async semantics don't compose well, so when you start to do anything a little complicated (e.g. launch N requests and call back when all N have either returned or failed), the two trip over one another. Working in a Lisp that compiles to JS, I had to write some surprisingly complex macros in order to get correct behaviour. I wouldn't dream of writing that JS code by hand.",1362338697

5314871,comment,5313918,5314529,6,0,zemo,,,"Gopher here.  I'll try my best as to why I chose Go over Scala; this isn't meant to be ""why I think Go is better than Scala"", it's ""how Go kept me interested from zero to gopher, while Scala failed to attract my attention"".<p>Scala didn't keep me curious for long enough to get good at it.  I took a look at some examples, flipped through a textbook, and just came to the conclusion that there were way too many features and it appeared to be too clever for me to care.  Things like impressive one-liners don't impress me; they do the opposite.  That it's built on the JVM doesn't particularly appeal to me because I don't have any existing JVM-dependent projects.  Examples like this: <a href=""http://www.scala-lang.org/node/225"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scala-lang.org/node/225</a><p><pre><code>    /** Turn command line arguments to uppercase */\n    object Main {\n      def main(args: Array[String]) {\n        val res = for (a <- args) yield a.toUpperCase\n        println(""Arguments: "" + res.toString)\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nthe toUpperCase method being called without parens is bothersome to me, since it makes it ambiguous what is and is not a function call.  The for loop being an expression is strange to me; it's a construct that appears to add no value to the programer, at a significant cost of clarity.  It must make me seem very stupid to argue against looping constructs as simple expressions, but I think this type of notation is unnecessarily terse.  Go doesn't have this type of thing, because the language is designed more for clarity than for terseness.  I don't think that this is elegant:<p><pre><code>    for (a <- args) yield a.toUpperCase\n</code></pre>\nI think it's far too clever.  Beyond the method call, another thing that appears to be hidden here is the creation of the target list to which the uppercase letters are being stored.  How many memory allocations are there in this statement?  What if the body of that loop is conditional and we don't know how much space we need in advance?  Yes, it's nice to look at, and I can see how it might be exciting to understand that for the first time, but... everything that it adds seems to be completely unimportant, but the operations that much be happening have been hidden from view.  Great, we've saved a bit of typing, but in the process, we've lost a lot of understanding about how our program behaves.<p>Then there are other simple things.  I really enjoy that curly brackets are mandatory on looping constructs in Go; I noticed that Scala has the feature that you can leave them off and it only includes the next statement.  I find that feature profoundly annoying and prefer that it does not exist.  I really like the way the tooling enforces formatting.  I really like the way that Go is militant.  When I write Go, I feel like I'm at work assembling an information processing machine; I don't feel like I'm writing poetry.  I don't <i>want</i> to feel like I'm writing poetry.  I'm happy to be making information machines, because that's the honest truth of the craft.  The poetry lies in what those machines do; the art is in the output.  To me, writing a boring program whose code is very clever is like writing a boring poem in beautiful calligraphy and arguing that the beauty of the calligraphy makes the poem better.<p>So that's why I went with Go, and not Scala.  Of course, there are things I wish we had; specifically operator overloading and something akin to generics, the former we almost certainly will never get, while the latter remains an open question.  A part of me misses having properties or Python's decorators, but... these are features that I've found can easily create maintenance problems; features that have caused trouble for me in the past.<p>Go, of course, has its warts (some would argue that the language made entirely of warts), but while learning the language I always got the feeling that the things that were annoying were good for me; that the warts were like being told to eat your vegetables.  After a year and a half of programming Go regularly, I've found that to be largely true.  My old code is much easier for me to go back to than the equivalent in other languages, and I've found my Go projects to be very easy to maintain, overall.<p>Go's code is the right level of terseness for me.  It's far, far shorter than equivalent Java code and it's very clear.  To me, elegance is clarity.  To others, elegance is terseness.  It's all a matter of opinion.  I think you'd be hard-pressed to find someone that chose Go over Scala because of the merits of what can be built with one tool over the other; I reckon they're quite comparable in this regard.",1362338247

People do not routinely lecture men on things they should do to avoid getting raped. Most men walking by themselves at night do not worry about rape as one of the principal dangers to be wary of. Completely ignoring any question of how frequently rape <i>happens</i> to men, the mere existence of rape does not have anywhere near the impact on men's lives as it does on women's.<p>It is plausible to me that there is also a culture of shame affecting men who have been raped, along the lines that you have described. But if so, it is <i>very</i> silent compared to the rape culture surrounding women, and thus has far less impact on men who are not themselves victimized. It is no doubt no less awful for men who <i>are</i> the victims of rape, and I agree that any such culture must, must, must be fixed.<p>But at the same time, I can't blame the activists out there for targeting their primary effort at the side of the problem that has the broadest effect and the widest societal impact. And also, I optimistically believe that if we eventually do manage to fix the culture of shame and blame attached to rape that affects women, a lot of that progress will automatically carry over to the case of men who are raped, too.

I've been appreciating your work since xfractint in 1994 or so.<p>Note that in a wired-AND-capable current-mode logic, like open-collector TTL, you can get a similar RS latch out of a couple of inverters wired into a Henkin-sentence circuit like this, with the latch inputs being the latch outputs; but the behavior is slightly different than what Ken documents here.  Here he says that, essentially, the 8085 tolerates bus-fight, but the bus drivers in the ALU are stronger than the bus drivers in the registers, and so after a brief bus fight, the register bit flips.<p>But with the wired-AND approach, bus fight doesn't exist; you just don't hook up any external zeroes to the Q and /Q lines if you want to read the latch, or to write it, you assert an external zero on one of them.<p>The trouble with open-collector logic, as I understand it (I've never built or debugged an open-collector circuit in my life) is that it's kind of slow.  If I understand Ken's post, the circuit described here is a kind of optimization of the wired-AND latch I described above: there's a weak positive driver stage to speed up positive-going edges on the output.  Is that right?<p>It's always interesting to see how real-world circuits depart from the purely digital, RTL ideal in order to save some resource.  Jeri Ellsworth's work reverse-engineering old chips (which I hope to God is not secret!) found another example: dynamic stages in pipelines, where rather than using a flip-flop or even an entire latch, you just rely on the capacitance of an input to hold the previous value for long enough that the next stage in the pipeline can do its job.  Works as long as you clock it fast enough, fails when you try to single-step the chip.<p>(Also, thank God, an actual hacking-related story on Hacker News, as opposed to ""I lost 3lbs and a percent of body fat in a week"" or ""Every night when my dad would come home from work he would be filthy from working at the junkyard all day."")",1362337204

250212,story,,,1,1,StudentSell,Studentsell.co.uk,,"Studentsell.co.uk (www.studentsell.co.uk) is an entity designed to act as a medium that enables students in Scotland to trade physical items and share information with each other and could be considered as an electronic version of the ultimate student notice board. \nThe main objective of the business is to create a vibrant niche trading community for the Scottish Higher Education marketplace and from this develop Studentsell.co.uk into a name synonymous with further education in Scotland, followed by the rest of the UK. \nStudentsell.co.uk does not incorporate a ‘bidding’ system used by auction sites - there is no reserve pricing, auction end times and last minute sniping. Instead members are offered items at a set price for immediate purchase. \nThe website has the potential to develop into an integral part of College and University life for students all over the country and although the work to Studentsell.co.uk has only recently been finalised with our website developers (Alienation Design – a Glasgow based award-winning company) there are already over 1500 registered members and this could easily be turned into several tens of thousands following a successful marketing strategy. \nThe student population is commonly regarded as one of the easiest markets to target because students are easily located. Further to this due to the fact that they live, work and socialise together positive user experiences will generate positive word of mouth and this should result in the website becoming very well known in student circles within a very short space of time.\nWebsites with very high levels of traffic, particularly with such a specific consumer base coupled with an extensive and accurate customer database have the potential of selling for several millions of pounds. Successful online trading communities can sell for vast sums frequently in the eight and nine figure regions. The following links are two recent examples of this phenomenon:\nhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1264250/Trade-Me\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4502550.stm",1216414618
250211,comment,249908,249908,0,0,zacharye,,,"Awesome - so glad to see enthusiastic responses! Let's give it a go then...<p>As I said in the OP, I will be more than happy to assist startups with one piece of marcom at no charge. No I'm not a dealer handing out free fixes, I just don't have the time or independent wealth right now to be able to offer more assistance. Believe me when I say that I love to be challenged creatively and I love variation. If I did have the time and independent wealth, nothing would make me happier than to do this for a living. The sentiment behind yan's / ia's suggestion above is something I've wondered about plenty in the past.<p>So here is what I ask of you:<p>1. Please send me an email and introduce yourself. Tell me a bit about your company, your core product(s), your target audience, your ideal customer and so on. Then tell me about the one problem item that we'll be tackling, be it product sheet, homepage, elevator pitch, mass email, etc.<p>2. Please be thorough. No one knows your product better than you so highlighting key features is of the utmost importance. When you've been eating, sleeping, breathing and living something for XX months, it becomes very easy to forget how to look at it from an outside perspective (this very fact is half the reason marcom people have jobs). Make sure you think about the key messages / features that you are hoping to highlight with this particular piece.<p>3. Please be patient. I promise that I will respond to each and every email sent. In fact, if you don't hear from me a few days after sending an email then by all means resend it. Regarding deliverables, please be understanding if I estimate a turnaround of six days and you haven't received anything from me on the seventh. I have no reason to believe that keeping an open line of communication will be difficult but at the same time, I do have other things on my plate. Re: time zone, I'm just outside of Manhattan (EST).<p>4. Please be clear. If there are elements of any job that should be considered confidential please ensure that you make me aware of them. I will not be sharing anything we discuss or work on but this relates to item 1 below.<p>5. Please include your HN username in your intro email.<p>What I ask in return:<p>1. Portfolio building - In the event that my own project does not pan out, I will likely end up re-entering the marcom world at some level. Your permission to include whatever we work on in a future portfolio would be greatly appreciated. If for any reason this is not a possibility, just make sure to specify that (item 4 above).<p>2. Friends and family plan - Please keep a few things in mind as I perform this service for you. I am in fact hoping to find a technical co-founder to work with me on my own SaaS so if you know talented and motivated people who might fit the bill, an intro would be greatly appreciated. I'm not going to ignore people who don't open their intro email with, ""Hi. My buddy is ready and waiting to build your vision!"" At the same time, bear in mind that networking is indeed my not-so-ulterior motive. Even if all you can do is connect to me on LinkedIn and write a two-sentence recommendation that might help me sometime in the future, I would appreciate it.<p>3. Your ear - Once my work for you is complete, feel free to ask me about the SaaS I am considering. The opportunity to bounce ideas off of intelligent people ""in the thick of it"" is something I will never refuse. It is perfectly understandable if you are too busy with your own business to chat along these lines. No harm, no foul and good luck to you in your endeavors. I hope I was able to make a difference for you.<p>4. 2% equity - Calm down, that was a joke...<p>So with all that behind us: My name is Zach, I have nine years of small-company marcom experience under my belt, I'm now seeking more out of life and my email is in my profile. Looking forward to doing what I can to help.",1216414616

It would be nice if you could opt out, but this is easily solved by OpenDNS or some other service.

I can imagine far worse fates, particularly given how enamored of Java the entire industry was at the time.  I have nothing but respect for Eich and JavaScript.  It's held up strikingly well for what could have been, and odds were in favor of it being, a band aid solution.  Given the circumstances, I think we're just lucky that Netscape had some of the best developers in the world working on it at that time...because the one who got stuck adding ""scripting"" happened to be quite gifted and ambitious, and took the task very seriously and came up with something quite clever.<p>It was a very different time, and dynamic languages were a bit downtrodden.  Tcl was the closest to a ""standard embedded scripting language"" and I think I'm comfortable calling JavaScript a more powerful language than Tcl (at least at the time, though I think the two have stayed the same related to one another over that time, despite advances in both).  And, of course, Tcl was only popular among UNIX nerds.  Getting Windows developers on board might have been a problem...a whole new ""simple"" language like JavaScript may have been exactly what the industry needed.  I dunno.

250148,comment,249967,250097,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"It seems like many of the strengths of Lisp/Scheme are an emergent property of the S-expression syntax, though. Expressions like ((if test func-one func-two) arg1 arg2 etc) are certainly more awkward with infix notation, for example. Using OO/polymorphism is one way around this, but that's a bit heavy-handed in situations where it's just a workaround for infix syntax. (Duplicated code with a switch or if block is even worse.) Also, macros / code generation are vastly easier with a consistently prefix notation.<p>Similarly, many of the advantages of stack-based languages like Forth and Factor emerge from postfix notation. Very interesting to compare the two.<p>It's really too bad that non-C-style syntax freaks people out so much, from a technical standpoint it's almost certainly the worst of the three. </fighting words>",1216411341

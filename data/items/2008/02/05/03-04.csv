If you didn't need flash's interactivity, graphics or sound it would be pretty silly to use it.",1202183813

This traffic usually has a low bounce rate of 20-30%. However when we took the same page and bid on StumbleUpon network for paid insertions it sure sends traffic but visitors hardly stay. Bounce rates hit 90%.",1202183699

Apparently, there are a lot of startups, Fortune 500, and Inc 500 companies competing for the same people.  At least, that's what I've come to understand.

109505,comment,109360,109500,0,0,boucher,,,"See, I wholeheartedly agree with you about IE, but flash suffers from many of the same problems.<p>It's a plugin, so right out of the gate a whole class of people won't be able to use it.  Plus, even though many have flash installed, versions vary widely, so unless you code for flash 6, again, good luck working with everyone's computer.<p>There's a right way to do things, with built in browser support, across all the major browsers.  We spent time up front to make sure things did work, and now we continue to reap the benefits.",1202182691

109494,comment,109273,109273,0,0,SamReidHughes,,,"""Confined to the type system"" is funny language.  Which type system?  I have personally never felt confined to any type system except for C++'s and Java's.  And even then, it's not so much the type system as it is the verbiage needed to define new types.  I don't mean to go all Haskell-zealot on this comment's readers, but Haskell's would be an example of a type system where I have not felt confined.  I am confined in the sense that I am confined to the three dimensions of this universe, but not any more than that.  Wanting to violate its type system would be like wanting to walk in the direction of the fourth dimension.  But then again, you can (and should not) violate its type system if you really want to do so.<p>Also, static typing can help with testing, since if you know your types, you have handy tools like QuickCheck that you can use.<p>> ""Type verification provides very little confidence that an application works.""<p>So what?  It makes finding errors and fixing them faster and easier.  And it makes making changes easier, unless you're changing the behavior of stateful objects.",1202181436

779801,comment,779723,779723,0,0,BrentRitterbeck,,,"This reminds me of a business case study done during my undergrad days.  I don't remember the finer details of the study, but I remember the lesson.  The case study was basically a company that had screwed up royally.  We were not given much of any hints as to what needed to be done.  Most people, including myself, went about creating huge forecasts for trying to solve a problem that really couldn't be solved.  We were all wrong.  The lesson of the case study was this:  Sometimes the only answer is to admit that something has gone wrong, stay calm, severe ties to the project, understand what went wrong, and go about things with what you have left.  This is one of the most important things I learned in business school.",1250974712

The instantaneous brightness combined with the phase of the dot gives it a local map of reflectivity.

779792,comment,779472,779472,0,0,wmeredith,,,"I'm assuming this is something we've all considered around here and my advice is to be very careful. This <i>has been</i> common (if not standard procedure as claimed below) for PR firms for a few years now, but it won't be common for much longer.<p>In July, Lifestyle Lift (cosmetic surgery outfit) got slapped with a $300,000 fine by the state of New York for having employees leave false-positive reviews online. The FTC has labeled this ""astroturfing"" and has made public announcements that they are <i>very interested</i> in the ease with which this practice is accomplished on large scales with new media and how that relates to their role regarding consumer protection.<p>I'm the online marketing guy at an integrated marketing firm in Kansas City, and last week I warned a client off of false reviews in favor of more legitimate marketing efforts (compelling link-bait, usability investments, article marketing, PPC, etc...) just last week. I cited this case during that conversation.<p>It's exciting to be in marketing, and the media industry in general, right now because all the rules are being re-written. It also means that you'd better stay up to date on the environment you're operating in. I'm not qualified to offer legal advice, but it seems to me that having an employee leave disingenuous reviews online isn't a far jump from having a PR firm under contract do it for you.",1250974330

We start with: <i>Let's say your goal is to reduce gasoline consumption.</i><p>And then we start talking about fuel efficiency.  IIRC, though, it's pretty well established in the economics literature that increasing fuel efficiency doesn't reduce gas consumption much, if at all.  Increased fuel efficiency means lower effective gas prices, which people respond to by driving more.<p>The net effect is about the same level of fuel consumption, with more cars on the road (i.e. more traffic and more accidents).<p>If you want to reduce gas consumption, you have to increase the price.

Yes? Of course? I mean, I don't condone people hacking FB accounts, of course. But why do you think a belief as ridiculous as that deserves any protection whatsoever?<p>I'm not really singling out Christianity, either. If someone hacked a known homophobe's Facebook account and posted photoshopped pictures of them sucking cock, or got into a racist's account and started talking about their black girlfriend, I'd applaud, and couldn't give a damn about ""making them trash their own value system"".<p>And the funny thing is, if the opposite occurred and, say, a right wing nutcase hacked my FB account and could say whatever they wanted - they couldn't really do any damage, because my entire self-image isn't founded on maintaining some ridiculous social façade. It would be an embarrassing security lapse, possibly provoke some mild teasing from friends and family, and life would go on.<p>=======<p>UPDATE: Man, I am a really bad debater. I'm coming across pro-vandalism and anti-peaceful-tolerance here. Despite my views on religion that's not what I wanted to say; my argumentative position is drifting towards the extreme to oppose Mr. Markham. If I were a better debater, I'd be able to resist that - we're well into ""devil's advocate"" territory for me by now.<p>I do not condone these attacks. I wanted to make the point that I don't consider these attacks to be particularly hurtful or serious, and that anyone who is seriously upset ""when somebody takes their identity and has them say things they never would"" should lighten up.<p>I got a little too far into ""asshole mode"" above too. I won't change it now but actually, I wouldn't support defacement of this Great Pumpkin believer's page. Why? Because my whole <i>actable</i> complaint against religion is that it's intolerant. I strongly oppose religious superstition, of course, but that's not a legitimate reason to take action against them. Simply being stupid is not evil, in and of itself. Intolerance, however, is the actable offence and that's what legitimises attacks upon religion. Now if the Followers of the Great Pumpkin had a political agenda against other segments of the worlds' population, that would be a <i>casus belli</i>.<p>I would like to say, though, that if you hold beliefs that seem to make you a favourite ""lulz target"" then you should probably re-examine them.",1250973290

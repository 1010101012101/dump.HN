I sometimes flip back through meeting notes from six months ago, and notice that by and large I don't follow up on my ""action items"" and haven't done the things I wrote down as my critical things to do in the next month. The only things that get done are the ones to be done quickly after the meeting. Everything else fell off... and you know what? It <i>should</i> have! I have not suffered for not doing them, I did something more valuable instead.<p>I've tried the text file, but it goes to a hundred lines too quickly. Writing stuff down is better, it's a backup memory store but if you don't keep actively copying things over they disappear. And I'm yet to lose something that important.<p>On the opposite extreme, I like my bug trackers. There's a mental adjustment to the fact that I have hundreds of bugs at any given time (I'm in charge of my project and the default assignee), and it can even take years to make that adjustment, but now that I have it is a great thing. There's a few current high-priority tasks, and background noise.

The squares I draw below my to-do items represent the number of 25 minute intervals I anticipate the task to take. I cross them off each time my timer rings. If I underestimate the intervals of a task, I add a circle for each unexpected interval. This allows me to see patterns in my planning and works as a mechanic to finish things as scheduled.<p>Once the day is over, I remove the sticky note from my desk and ""archive"" it by re-sticking it on that day in my planner.",1271036635

Granted, most new phones seem to focus on the touch screen, but I can imagine there are other similar differences that might affect how native an app feels on the iPhone platform. After all, it seems that there are iPhone app developers moving to the Mac that create iPhone-like interfaces that don't quite feel at home on the Mac. If there are subtle but noticeable differences between Mac OS X and iPhone OS, I can imagine there are more than a few such subtle differences between the iPhone feel and the feel on other platforms.",1271036084

My understanding is that cross platform frameworks cater to a lowest common denominator among platforms, perhaps occasionally supporting a custom feature here and there.  Even then, the people developing the app need to spend the necessary effort to take advantage of platform specific features, as opposed to just deploying the identical app to all platforms.",1271035123

I keep 5 lists - the 3 above, one Projects list (from the GTD book) and one Errands list.<p>The projects list is a list of projects that I have on my list (anything with more than 1 TODO against it is a project). The only reason for this list is to drive the Todo list (there can be one-off items in the Todo list that do not belong to any project). Once I am satisfied that all the necessary Todos for any project are done, I strike off the project off the list.<p>There are times when the Todo item of a certain project lingers way too long on the Todo list. This is usually indicative of<p>a) The project needs to move to the later list<p>b) Take the project off the list altogether. If it's that important it will come up soon<p>The Errands list is not that different from the ToDo list, but it's essentially stuff I have to do as I am out and about. Shopping/Going to the Bank/Public Library all go in that list. This way, once I am in ""errands"" mode, I just make sure to knock out as much as I can off that list.

If Apple releases a new API not available in the cross-platform tool, cross-developers are far more likely to ignore it than developers targeting Apple's platform specifically.<p>I would agree with you that Apple's been doing the same lock-in with Mac OS for a long time, but I'm not so sure they've been on the losing end of anything. I remember that when Jobs came back to Apple, they had free WWDC videos online, and attendance was very much in decline. Since he came back, they removed the Java bridge stuff, Carbon and at the same time they're charging good money for a WWDC that tends to sell out really quickly. Lock-in on the Apple way seems to me to be a fairly successful strategy.",1271034365

People like to demonize drug companies, but really, they are just confronted with terribly complex problems. You see pills that treat symptoms more often than pills that cure because of this complexity. On the road to a cure, there are many things discovered. They can be applied to make the patients life better in the interim -- and they should.<p>However, I agree whole-heartedly that this is the type of medicine that needs to be done more often. Researchers are victims of the ""can`t see the forest for the trees"" problem -- especially in medicine. There is a disconnect between bedside and lab bench that is artificial and limiting.<p>Interestingly, patients are starting to collaborate, swapping notes about things they remembered -- looking at things from an admittedly naive but certainly systemic approach.

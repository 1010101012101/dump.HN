You may find the Ruby (or Python etc.) community more supportive. There are exceptions to each - there are .NET startups, and Ruby is making inroads at lots of big corporations - but your career will likely have a different flavor depending on what you choose.",1213459158

217560,comment,217440,217554,0,0,notauser,,,"Symbian is closed source (and, as you say very popular and very good).<p>The open source Nokia is looking to adopt is Linux, already seen on the N810. Nokia seems to be making the move to cut development costs.<p>Nokia also doesn't just sell phones, they also sell network infrastructure and service and software outside of the telecomms industry.<p>Quite why they think that the OSS world will help them with DRM is beyond me. It seems highly optimistic at best. But since it is open source they can really do what they want provided they are willing to comply with the license and pay their own developers. There is not much stopping companies erecting DRM on top of Linux (and other GPLv2 code) - see TiVo and the motivation for moving to GPL v3 for an example.",1213459021

217554,comment,217440,217440,0,0,brandonkm,,,"I think the spokesman for Nokia is spot on.  Nokia is a key component behind the symbian os, which is the most widely used os on phones and is open source as well.  Right now Android is really just a concept that has had no commercial implementation.  I really don't think Android will surpass symbian or s60 ever.  Nokia is the only company in this game who just makes phones, this is what they do best, so they are in a unique position.  People arn't going to use Android on their phones just because it's made by Google.  Only a small amount of people even know about Android and its non-existant in handsets out on the market now.  Symbian and S60 however are widespread with presence worldwide in a wide variety of handsets.",1213457408

It should be visible without turning the head, but not directly in your retina. Mine is (accidentally) half a meter above and behind the monitor and works just fine.

Sterile water is actually bacteriostatic, because there is no food for the bacteria to grow in.<p>Silver and other heavy metals are bacteriostatic as well.  Other substances are bactericidal, which means that they actively kill bacteria.<p>Antibiotics are bactericidal.  You don't want to take antibiotic or bactericidal substances on a regular basis, because you end up putting unnecessary evolutionary selection pressure on your normal bacterial flora.  That is, you don't want to kill all the good bacteria, otherwise the bad ones will overpopulate because they have no competition.<p>I'm guessing that the crocs aren't bactericidal, they are probably baceriostatic.",1213456242

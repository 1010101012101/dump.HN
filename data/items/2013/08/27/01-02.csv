What if white gays were typically irresponsible with money (because omg shoes) and as a consequence my credit score is forever (or at least initially) tarnished because I&#x27;m a white homo, irrespective of my bill-paying ability. I can see many ethical issues with this.<p>Yes it seems wrong, but why does it matter what the data is if it&#x27;s being used to make more accurate predictions? That&#x27;s the goal. The data being used makes no difference. We aren&#x27;t talking about humans which are irrational and go &quot;omg I hate gay people and want to make them worse off by refusing to do business with them&quot;, this is an unbiased computer algorithm looking to predict how likely you are to pay back your loan. If you really are less likely to pay back your loan than so be it. It can just as easily go the other way and judge in your favor. On average you should expect to benefit from such a policy, not lose from it.<p>>LOL. People will do a lot in the name of money. If Ms. Sally wants a mortgage, like really, really, really bad, Ms. Sally is gonna drop her deadbeat Facebook friends and game the fuck out the system. If she&#x27;s successful, not only is she more likely to be approved for that mortgage, but she&#x27;ll get a better rate. I think it&#x27;s naive to believe that any other behavior is being encouraged by this kind of predictive credit scoring.<p>It will probably be difficult to game the system (just deleting friends doesn&#x27;t remove your info and might be a red flag that you are trying to do that.) The benefits are probably small (they are using all sorts of other data on top of it to make predictions about you.) And people don&#x27;t know what the algorithms are or even what information they are using, which makes it harder to figure out how to game it.<p>But even if they do so, so what?

You could, for example, survey developers who had experience with both and ask them.  If you wanted to be more scientific, you could randomly select a group of freshman computer students, randomly assign half to a ruby group and half to a php group.  Teach the ruby group ruby for year 1 and php for year 2, and vice versa for the php group.  Then survey everyone.  The point is you are trying to make this into an amorphous philosophical issue, when in fact it&#x27;s a practical question that does have an answer.<p>This is not scientific, but it is a personal observation: Most (not all, but most) of the developers I&#x27;ve met who make the arguments you are making and defend php as &quot;just as good as any other language&quot; and dismiss its detractors as hipster bandwagon followers don&#x27;t actually have that much experience working with a language like python or ruby.

This theory is especially make sense if you look at what properties were hacked - they're mostly local-market websites. So, I'd say, the only one hacked property Sony must really be embarrased for is PSN, hands down.",1307285915

I'd love to hear more about them.<p>Ocaml's problem, from what I've seen, is that INRIA wants to run a tight ship regarding the design of the language. This makes sense, but it also means a lot of real-world use cases get ignored. For example, my understanding is that priming Ocaml for multicore use would require substantial rewrites that aren't a high priority, given INRIA's desire to maintain it as a ""research language"".<p>The 2^22 - 3 array limit (and the corresponding 2^24 - 12 string limit) on a 32-bit machine (it's 2^54 - 3 on a 64-bit system) are examples of this: the language designers simply didn't anticipate that people would be using the language for purposes that require such enormous arrays or strings. These use cases are tremendously important for real-world production use but not terribly interesting from a research perspective.",1307285879

It was probably a problem.<p>I've seen such signs at cheap chain restaurants in Japan. (I'm not attempting to generalize here, just relating an experience) The clear message was that high schoolers would come and buy the $3 all-you-can-drink soda package and sit and study and chat all day.

2622082,comment,2621192,2621357,2,0,websymphony,,,"I know! Right now I am storing cursor coordinates as one moves and displaying it via red squares. \nMy initial thought was to timestamp each point and then every few seconds make an ajax request to server with just the updated data. And once I have lets say 2000-3000 points, run some sort of algorithm to weed out arbit points and have only most visited coordinates displayed as most popular regions.  Easy peasy right?\nBut now as I am thinking more about it, I think the data I will have might not be able to accomplish the task. My first question to myself is, a point on my screen will have different coordinates than yours, for example lets say the top left corner of button that shows map is 300,400 on my screen. But since my screen resolution might be different than yours, it might become 200,300 on your screen. Therefore data point loses its relevance.\nOne approach that I can think of to solve this issue. Get screen resolution of each user along with the data points, which can be used to normalize the data back on server.\nAny thoughts, suggestions?",1307285280

It should be noted that this was ONLY OtherOS and required soldering. Did Sony really think that people were going to commercialize homebrew games that require hardware mods? Or did they know that GeoHot was onto something big?\nAs revenge, Sony took away OtherOS for everybody and reassigned Geoff Levand.<p>And when then GeoHot hacked the 3.21 firmware just to get OtherOS back. Sony blocked it again. This was the point forced the community's hand to looking for solutions that might also allow piracy (although the wheels may have been in motion already). Really, based on the PSP experience they should have known how this works.",1307283815

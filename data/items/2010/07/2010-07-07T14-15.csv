http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1488170<p>Jason's first article about newsletters almost a year ago is what first got me thinking about this idea. The front page of HN always has great reads that provide value to me. However, there are times when I can't get on for a week or when I know if I open HN I will end up on there for an hour or more. I have heard others share the same situation, and at the time thought some sort of newsletter would be a great fit with the content on HN. I didn't have time to pursue that idea at the time, but recently I found some notes that stirred my memory and along with the new Hacker Monthly (which I didn't think would work when Lim first talked about it, but after seeing the first edition and how he pulled it off - I stand corrected), I am moving forward with it.<p>The Hacker Newsletter will be a weekly collection of the top items on Hacker News. I will link to articles (and comments) based on votes/comments, and there will be an editorial side to it where I might add/remove things based on what I think is most useful for a weekly digest. I will also feature the best ""Ask HN"" posts, job threads, and a look back at some past articles that would still be useful today. Lastly, I want to do some original content as well and have some different ideas that I am working on, but one will be highlighting projects that HN members have release (both small and large).<p>Depending on how large the list gets and my time spent on it, I probably will include an ad (hopefully from HN startups) and/or job postings to help pay for it later on.<p>I want to build something that will serve the HN crowd well, so <i>any</i> feedback is very welcome. The first email will go out this Saturday and you can opt-in at:

For what it's worth, the Fourth Amendment protects against 'unreasonable' searches and seizures. Anything found in the reasonable execution of a search warrant is admissible.<p>I don't know where the myth came from that only evidence related to the probable cause of the warrant is admissible. This is an on-face absurd interpretation: by that logic, if the police entered a house to search for evidence of felony tax evasion and stumbled upon a murder in progress, that wouldn't be admissible because the police weren't in the house searching for a murderer.<p>There is plenty of case law establishing limits on reasonability. For instance, in the execution of a lawful search of an apartment looking for weapons, officers saw a stereo that 'didn't fit the furnishings'. They lifted up the bottom of the stereo to take down serial numbers, and the person was arrested for having stolen the stereo. The problem, of course, is that weapons aren't stored under the bottom of a flat-bottomed stereo, and certainly the serial numbers weren't a reasonable part of the search for weapons.<p>But having drugs out in the middle of the room in 'plain view' is clearly reasonable. Even from weev's own post, the drug evidence passes the <i>Horton</i> test.",1278513135

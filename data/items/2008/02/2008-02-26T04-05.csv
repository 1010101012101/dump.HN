I don't know if many of you have tried .NET, but it's quite a powerful and well-designed platform (surprising for Microsoft). It also has the smartest languages of any mainstream development environment (F# and C# 3.0). Flex and Air cover maybe 1/10 of the features .NET has and it's going to be a few more years at the very least before it's a serious competition to Microsoft.",1204001785

I've made the mistake that the company's and mine interests were the same far too often and gotten burned by it.  The problem I'll run into is how to align my interests and those of my employees when I'm running my own shop, but I'll worry about that when I need to.  Right now it is too soon for those sort of worries.",1204001366

123621,comment,123509,123509,0,0,nandan,,,"Assumptions the article makes:
1. People are stupid, they cant and dont adapt.
2. The market system is rigid and exploitative.<p>Can we expect the three people who were hired instead of John Ulviden to make the same ""mistake"" he made? Probably not. If they were people looking out for their own self-interests, they would factor in the ""mistake"" John made and make sure they dont step over the ""acceptable"" amount of sales. What sort of an effect does this have for Adidias? They reach a high-point in sales due to the energy and creativity of John, but then because of what they did to him, their sales are no longer going up. They have just lost the opportunity to have John take their sales to the next level.<p>And what sort of an opportunity does this present to a competitor like Nike for example?  They would probably want John for more than one reason: For his abilities and also for the relationships he has with the customers he won over for Adidas.<p>Heck, why ramble when there is such eloquent exposition at hand:<p>""In addition to these endless pleadings of self-interest, there is a second main factor that spawns new economic fallacies every day. This is the persistent tendency of men to see only the immediate effects of a given policy, or its effects only on a special group, and to neglect to inquire what the long-run effects of that policy will be not only on that special group but on all groups. It is the fallacy of overlooking secondary consequences."" - Henry Hazlitt in ""Economics in One Lesson""<p><a href=""http://jim.com/econ/contents.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jim.com/econ/contents.html</a>",1203999331

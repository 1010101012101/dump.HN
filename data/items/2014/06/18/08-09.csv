7909103,comment,7908578,7908783,23,0,pling,,,"I hope this is comedy. If it isn&#x27;t, give me a break :)<p>Excuse the vent - I just spent two hours fixing some shit just for IE...<p>Seriously. I spent a LOT of my time in front of IE and this is the real story:<p>The built in search determination is awful. Half the time, valid web sites are sent straight to bing. It&#x27;s worse than Safari and Chrome by miles. The only hope is hit Ctrl+E to force it to search. It&#x27;s as smart is a lobotomized monkey.<p>Pinnable sites are just bookmarks outside the browser. This isn&#x27;t really all that useful. I have never seen a person use it, ever.<p>As for multitasking, it supposedly no longer crashes the entire browser if a tab goes. That is total trash. Many a time have I lost the entire thing after a tab crashed. As for security, the recent unpatched hole for several days says how the privsep implementation DOESN&#x27;T work well (mandatory integrity control). It&#x27;s half arsed at best.<p>As for Windows Phone, I owned one (Lumia 820 w/ WP8).  The IE version is abysmal. It crashes regularly, renders text in crazy sizes randomly all over the place and hardly works at all across the web. Why? Because people don&#x27;t use it so no one cares about it. Perhaps that isn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s problem but even Microsoft&#x27;s web site doesn&#x27;t work properly (MSDN subs+Azure management portal) The browsing story on my Moto G is an order of magnitude better than WP ever was for me.<p>Why should I pay for an XBox live sub to use something I paid for? The XBox is a horrible abomination. Most of the games whinge and moan if you&#x27;re not plugged into the Internet, even if you want a single player campaign. It&#x27;s painful. The whole thing is obstructive and painful. The browser on my 360 is slow, unreliable as well and doesn&#x27;t render half of the sites anywhere near how they should be rendered.<p>The big one for me really is that Microsoft can&#x27;t even make their OneDrive versions of Excel work properly with IE11. Half the time (on several different machines) the spreadsheet display gets corrupted around the currently selected cell.<p>Then we come to the dev story:<p>1. The entire back end of IE is a shit crock. The dev tools have no idea what is happening on the wire. They have no idea if the HTTP runtime got the file from cache or the wire meaning we have to use proxies. What&#x27;s the point of it then?<p>2. The console is useless, even on IE11. Half the time it doesn&#x27;t work and the code inspector lies a lot about the state of the DOM. The same with the object inspector.<p>3. The icons and UI is horrible. Until you&#x27;ve been using it for a bit, it&#x27;s unusable. Try it on a laptop as well - the left bar is unusable. The only hope is undock it from the browser and Alt-Tab. Some idiot thought that the Azure management portal looked cool and lets change everything to make it look like that.<p>4. The debugger JS regularly crashes the entire browser and doesn&#x27;t always hit breakpoints.<p>5. Compatibility mode. This is a royal PITA for us. It has cost us a shit ton of money. First we got told by MS that this thing was Jesus&#x27; sandals. Now we have 2000 users with random distribution of forced compatibility view and no way to turn it off. Inevitably that means we now have 2x the number of test cases to execute.<p>Just no. Seriously. They can go hang. I&#x27;ve had to put up with 15 years of this crap.",1403081992

(I recently caved to that one, and reopened my Google+ simply to be able to login to sites where I was using my google login for authentication. they chose to take away that ability if you don&#x27;t use G+, along with the ability to use the mobile hangout app, just because they can. i should move elsewhere.) now they&#x27;re capitalizing on the market share of YouTube to coerce small labels, while large labels were reportedly given preferential treatment. but the fact that they will abuse YouTube instead of simply opening a new, independent service, and trying to win over customers to it, instead of forcing them over, that part stings me.",1403081969

Now that things have matured, they are going after the big established players: Google for search/advertising, Facebook for social activity, Twitter for censorship/regulated speech, Amazon for commerce, Youtube for copyright. It will happen more and more and there is no way around it. The classic cyberpunk countermeasure of finding a friendly nation to hide behind just doesn&#x27;t work in the long run, as Sweden has proven with the PirateBay case.<p>It might be an unpopular opinion here, but I believe the rise of a global network will inevitably force the rise of a global government. A higher authority is now necessary to sort out this sort of problems in a consistent way. It&#x27;s the natural evolution we&#x27;ve seen in the past when trade and knowledge networks reached a dimension where differences in legislation made it too difficult for them to flow. The question is: how do we define this global government? Which interests will it represent in practice? I think it&#x27;s something we should embrace, because otherwise we will be forced to accept it at the point of a non-metaphorical gun.",1403081844

Global recession, lingering structural unemployment, and an accumulation of capital at the top of the economic pyramid.</blockquote><p>To blame systemic deregulation for the recession is to be profoundly unaware of the system in question.  One cannot speak of a free market when the very thing at the core of that market - i.e. money, the one thing that everyone buys when they&#x27;re selling something, and that everyone sells when they&#x27;re buying something - is in the hands of a monopoly, and a politically motivated one at that: its raison d&#x27;etre is not even the quality of the product it provides.<p>If money were edible, you would see much more clearly just what a centrally managed, soviet style style system this really is, because there&#x27;d be queues of starving citizens just as we saw back in the era of soviet resource management.<p>If anything, it could be argued that without the level of free market we&#x27;ve enjoyed, things would be much, much worse.

One question is, how do you protect the business from free-riding competitors who are better capitalized and want to &quot;enclose the public commons&quot;? There have been a few promising efforts in crowdfunding of creative activity, where the resulting content was owned by the creators, e.g.<p>- (YC) Beacon for journalism<p>- Star Citizen game ($40M+ raised to date, for 1 game)<p>- Minecraft did well in selling alpha software<p>These models seem to work best when there is a strong community invested in using the creative work, and interested in funding roadmaps.  Payment infrastructure for DIY crowdfunding continues to improve: <a href=""http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/09/your-guide-to-diy-crowdfunding-tools-to-avoid-kickstarter-fees/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2013/09/your-guide-to-diy-crow...</a> .  PayPal&#x27;s API can split a payment between several parties, e.g. 5% to patronage platform.<p>When DRM gets implemented in the browser (starting with video, but will inevitably be extended to ePub3 ebooks and thus any web page), public awareness will skyrocket with &quot;no-can-do&quot; messages that users will experience several times a day.  Google can pull the rug out from Firefox whenever they want, making Chrome (and app store policies) as much a point of influence as Google Panda.<p>The low-cost way to get started is not to host content, but to create a decentralized directory based on crowd-sourced metadata (itself public domain) for public domain content.  Start off by collecting the Top 500 most-viewed public domain items from: Youtube, Soundcloud, Universities, Internet Archive, Libraries/Museums.  If that gets traction as a proof of concept, it can be scaled up.<p>In the short term, Qt (have you seen QtBitcoinTrader?) and luajit could form the base of a modern version of Groove/Chandler that runs on Mac/Linux/Windows.  Medium term could incorporate concepts from secushare (p2p), camlistore (CCNx), askemos (trust) and tinc vpn.<p>In the long term, this needs to become a new operating system, borrowing concepts from Rebol, Plan9, Ethos OS, Genode, Qubes OS, etc. Then it can run on dedicated in-home hardware with virtualization and always-on connectvity to trusted peers and mobile devices.  But that pipe dream requires success from earlier, simpler to deploy products :)  Ping me if you want to brainstorm.",1403080431

So you get to know how you &quot;compare&quot; in terms of &quot;performance&quot;, but not how much Google <i>actually</i> values you as an employee? Is this just an aspect of &quot;if you generate revenue we pay you more&quot;?",1403078590

It is definitely not a disparate group of people and organisations trying to make an effective and functioning society.  It is <i>sinister</i>\n> Intelligence services watch your children naked.  Seriously - this is disturbingly dark.  In nealty 10 years of service neither I or anyone I ever met in my employment ever saw a child naked.  Honestly; that comment hints at real psychological problems. \n> Government oversight of communications travelling along copper wires is the same as pre-WW2 Nazi Germany\n> Assertions we live in a police state etc etc.  Which is hilarious because I have been to actual police states and very few people assert online they live in a police state.  You know, on account of that not being wise in an actual police state.<p>I could go on but this is beyond absurd.<p>Privacy concerns? Legitimate. \nAnything else? Hollywood-isation of actual intelligence work.  99% of it is seriously boring and no one gives a fuck what porn you watch.  Bit busy trying to stop actual people getting killed.",1403078590

Then one apple is worth six lemons.  So, say that one lemon is worth one penny.  Then one orange is worth three pennies, and one apple is worth six pennies.  So, we now have prices for everything.<p>So, what is one penny?  It's a 'common ratio'.<p>My analogy is the same for time:  One tuning fork vibrates at 100 Hz, another at 200 Hz, and another at 600 Hz.  So, call one time 'tick' the time of one period of the 600 Hz tuning fork.  Then the one period of the 200 Hz tuning fork is three ticks, and, of the 100 Hz tuning fork, six ticks.  So, one 'tick' of 'time' is a common ratio.<p>Seems okay to me.",1306490247

Gave it to my wife, then bought myself a SG II. And I'm happily paying for my contract btw.<p>The carrier I'm talking about is a smaller one from Europe. It's unthinkable to ask this of Vodafone or Orange (the 2 big ones) since their heads are really up their buts. And the unlocking prices they charge are freakin` insane! It's not as if carriers can't do this, they just don't want to.<p>I really don't understand what's their problem. If I'm terminating my contract I have to pay the phone's subsidized price for the months remaining, their only loss is me as their customer, so WTF is the deal with sim-locked phones? I hate it when companies, instead of pleasing customers, are innovating in better lock-in methods.<p>But yes, I was talking about bootloader-unlock in my previous message. Really, Nexus S is the best Android sold right now, unfortunately it was only available from Vodafone and I'll never make a contract with Vodafone again.",1306488938

2590926,comment,2588696,2589685,2,0,fmap,,,"I don't really know Microsoft's C compiler well enough to answer why your specific example fails so spectacularly, but I can make a guess: You are using inline assembly containing a computed jump instruction. In this situation the compiler no longer has a complete view of the control flow graph of your function, and it is likely that all optimizations which need a control flow graph will be disabled. Common subexpression elimination needs a CFG since it determines if two computations are the same for all paths in the program.<p>Now I'm reasonably certain that the C standard does not allow inline assembly like this. However, given the decades of legacy software that Microsoft has to contend with I would not be too surprised if this was part of the reason.<p>By the way, GCC's computed gotos are not actually much better. In this case you get a control flow graph where you cannot split all critical edges. There is a workaround for this, but it's probably easier to just disable all optimizations that depend on it.",1306488677

2737750,comment,2736776,2737316,9,0,Cixelyn,,,"I think it's also useful to note _just_ how versatile a PCR machine is in biotech.  If every EE hacker needs an oscilloscope, every bioengineer hacker needs a PCR machine.  PCR is good for much more than just amplification -- a huge number of variations on the basic technique have surfaced in the past few years, here are just a few:<p>- Need to synthesize a new gene or genetic circuit?  Take a bunch of DNA fragments, design overlapping fragments which serve as the ""glue"", and use PCR to sew the whole thing together<p>- Want to know if your bacteria is the right strain?  Microwave a colony and toss it into the PCR machine with some probes to check.  Same thing if you want to test yourself for common disease risk factors such as the BRCA1 gene.<p>- Want to know the expression of protein A compared to protein B?  Use Q-PCR to get quantitative data on the difference.<p>- Made a mistake in your latest gene synthesis order?  Use PCR to change base-pairs or even edit out regions of DNA to fix the problem region.  Conversely, if you want to _introduce_ mutations / randomize segments of DNA, PCR can do that too!<p>There are many more uses of the general technique including next-gen sequencing and DNA origami that are just too numerous to list.  PCR is like the IDE of biology, containing an editor, a compiler, and a debugger all in one!<p>Really, my only complaint is that a PCR run takes an hour or more to run depending on the complexity.",1310028265

The reason is that you cannot simply do price comparison based on data-rates: it's a flawed top-level down approach ignoring very real concerns and constraints.<p>The reason for SMS being relatively expensive per byte is that it's actually a hack which allows us to send data over the global GSM control channel, not a regular phone-allocated voice/data-channel. This makes it's main carrier a very bandwidth constrained channel and SMS is second class traffic sent on a as-available basis, but with queued on demand push-reception for the recipient.<p>Your data-traffic however has a dedicated channel, realtime priority, and realtime constraints, and it would need to go trough a intermediate service which can queue it if the receiver is not there. And the recipient would have to have an always on data-connection polling for incoming messages, draining your battery, much like Email push-notification does on modern smartphones.<p>In other words: Data and SMS are fundamentally different services, operating with fundamentally different channels and technologies. Your OSI-minded application-level analysis is incomplete.<p>True, this might not make much difference to the end-user of the service provided, but there are technical reasons for why SMS and data is treated and priced differently.<p>As long as SMS is a defined standard as it is now, and that standard involves piping shit trough the GSM control channel and not using data (something you don't want when roaming abroad), the fact that they are priced differently is perfectly reasonable. If the price-difference itself is reasonable is another debate all together.",1310027777

2737715,comment,2725379,2737712,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part II<p>Here's some actual good career advice for women:  For the big corporations, essentially f'get about those.  Instead, nearly all of the US economy is on Main Street.  A big advantage here is a geographical barrier to entry:  Main Street in Peoria does not compete with Main Street in Paducah.<p>So, what businesses on Main Street?  A good one is to help your husband in such a business.  If he drives a taxi, then you can handle the phone calls.  If he runs a restaurant, then let him have the back of the house and you handle the front of the house.  If he is a lawyer, then you can be the office manager ('COO').  If he is farming 2000 acres, then you can handle the books.  If he owns 10 fast food shops, gas stations, convenience stores, pizza shops, etc., then you can help with personnel, staff scheduling, purchasing, leasing, the books, etc.<p>Else, you can be a CPA, tax lawyer, run a photocopying shop with office supplies, etc.  Or there are the two standards -- nursing and K-12 teaching.<p>These career directions are much more stable than being at the top of a large corporation.  Typically you get to put down 'roots' in a community and stay there and not move across the country every few years.  Since you and/or your husband own the business, you can't be fired.  Since the business meets a solid, continuing need in the economy and is not some strange flash in the pan, your job is stable.  Since you have many customers broadly in the economy, you cannot be hurt by just one or a few customers going under and, generally, will do okay unless the whole economy is in the tank.  If you are successful, say, grow to 10 McDonald's, then you can do quite well financially, typically better than a large corporation COO.  Often you get to bring your children to work and also get them a start in the 'family business'.  Such Main Street approaches totally knock the socks off being a big company C-level executive.<p>Crucial here is for you and your husband to be MARRIED and neither of you neglecting the marriage for something outside -- fast women, slow horses, cheap booze, applause from strangers, status, fame, prestige, saving the whales, oceans, environment, planet, etc.<p>Finland was a tough little country.  They beat the Swedes, the Soviets, and the Nazis.  Now Finland is world class in accomplishing the goals of 'feminism'.  But, now Finland is losing:  Finland is dying.  Literally.  The Fins are well on the way to being extinct, just as extinct as the Neanderthals.  Why?  On average, each woman in Finland has only 1.5 children.  Finland was able to beat the Swedes, Soviets, and Nazis but is losing to Ms. Sandberg's hero Gloria Steinem, who has no children at all.<p>Clearly this stuff of woman emphasizing something other than home and family encounters some fundamental 'Darwinian' problems and can't last.<p>Ms. Sandberg would have women be weak, sick, or dead limbs in the tree:  Even if Ms. Sandberg's two children are strong limbs, there are several woman among Ms. Sandberg's nanny and staff who will have a tough time having strong limbs.<p>So, at present, a large fraction of women of Western European descent are far too eager to strive to crash through glass ceilings and neglect home and family and, thus, are rapidly removing their genes from the gene pool.<p>We are currently in the period of most rapid change in the gene pool of the last maybe 20,000 years.<p>Why?  Clearly in the past women were strong limbs on the tree whether they really 'wanted' to be or not.  Now women have 'options'.  In a very few more generations, what will be left are nearly only women who very much want nothing to do with any such 'options'.  Whatever changes in the gene pool will be required will have to happen or the whole population of at least Western European descent will, along with Finland, go extinct.  Period.",1310027029

2737712,comment,2725379,2725379,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Part I<p>It's simple:  The article is promoting a grand disaster.  It's still more simple:  The article has a huge logical gap.<p>Sandberg does a lot of 'reaching out' to women; she does so much of this that the article can reasonably pose the question:<p>""Can Sheryl Sandberg upend Silicon Valleys male-dominated culture?""<p>In particular, as in Sandberg's buffet dinners with lots of women, her commencement speech at Barnard College, her TED talk, she's trying to talk to many women or 'most' women about how to 'do better'.<p>Then, that's the gap, at least in the article, and maybe also in what she is doing:  Right away we can see that her example and thinking as in the article (again, I'm talking about the article here and not necessarily her) just cannot even hope to work for more than 1% of women.  For the other 99+%, her example and advice, as in the article, is just somewhat dangerous fantasy nonsense.<p>For an analogy, not perfect but close enough, the claim is, play as well as Dirk Nowitzki and you, too, can win an NBA championship.  Nope:  No matter how many people play as well as Dirk Nowitzki, in a given year (on separate teams) at most one will win an NBA championship.  So, the fantasy of the article is nonsense.<p>To move this simple analogy closer to the real situation, only a very tiny fraction of people can have careers at or near the top of hot, leading, very valuable businesses.<p>Or, no matter what the heck the advice, just CANNOT put more than 1% of the people in the top 1% of the positions.  EVER.  Again, for the logical gap, the article is suggesting, entertaining its readers, with the fantasy that all women who will ""Be like Sheryl"" can also be in the top 1% of business jobs.  Nope.  So, the fantasy of the article is nonsense.<p>Next, there is a striking conflict right at the surface:  She has a nanny at home and a staff at work.  So, what about THOSE women, that is, the nanny, no doubt a woman, and the staff, likely well over 50% women?  That is, what about their 'work-life balance'?  For the children of the nanny, does the nanny have a nanny?  For the staff, does each staff member have a staff?  Since the answers are likely no, the fantasy of the article is nonsense.<p>So, net, how many women are setting aside their own 'work-life balance' so that Ms. Sandberg can be such a 'successful woman'?<p>Then at work, when 'crunch time' comes and she needs to be home with her two children, what does she do?  Sure:  First, she has a staff.  Second, she can delegate.  Third, she can rush home and spend 'quality time' with her children while the nanny does the washing, cleaning, cooking, etc.  Again, the fantasy of the article is nonsense, fundamentally, for all but a tiny fraction of women.<p>Next, for 'career advice' for women, the article and her example are nonsense.  Here is the blunt, bold, bottom line fact of life about careers in the US now and for some decades:  Making your career direction trying to be near the top of a large corporation is a fool's errand.  First, unless one gets lucky with stock, such as Ms. Sandberg did at Google, there's actually not much money, from just salary, after taxes, after unreimbursed business expenses, e.g., the clothes, car, nanny, house, buffets, in being in such a position.  E.g., her car will be expensive because as soon as it needs maintenance she won't sit there for a few hours in a muffler shop, brake shop, tune-up shop, tire shop, oil change place, etc. and, instead, will just trade in the thing for a new one.  Second, such jobs tend not to last very long.<p>In particular, the article is swooning over the situation that Ms. Sandberg can be a CEO:  Sure, just start a lemonade stand and be a CEO.  But the article means that she can be hired as a CEO in some large corporation.  Well, maybe.  Then what?  She's just a hired CEO, and that's NOT a very good job because (1) have to spend most of the effort trying to be successful while pleasing both the SEC and Wall Street (keeping down class action stockholder suits, etc.) and (2) actually do not have much real control over the future of the business.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs (after his RETURN to Apple which was nearly dead), Larry Ellison, Fred Smith have control; John Akers, Lou Gerstner, Jeffery Immelt, Carly Florina, didn't or don't.  Such jobs tend not to last very long.<p>The article shows another serious problem:  Ms. Sandberg flatly doesn't know what the heck she wants.  What she's done is to work hard, be great at memorization, dot i's, cross t's, each day have all the items on her to-do list checked off, do well going without sleep, save time on hair, makeup, exercise, and clothes, all for the goal of getting 'security' in some sense from getting praise, acceptance, and approval from a herd of women and the public from being an 'accomplished woman'.<p>That's her life's goal, her (P.  Tillich) 'ultimate concern' -- 'security' in some sense from getting praise, acceptance, and approval from a herd of women and the public from being an 'accomplished woman'.<p>She's making two huge mistakes:  (1) The point of work is to make money, bring the money home, deposit it in the family checkbook, pay the bills, and get some good financial security for the family.  Period.  That's IT.  Asking for more from work is a fool's errand pursued only by fools.  (2) The good things in life are what pursue once have done well enough on financial security.  Mostly these good things are the home and family and things close to them.  These good things are mostly NOT distant things such as praise, acceptance, and approval from a herd of women and the public.<p>If I were her husband, then I would conclude that she was a disaster as a wife, mother, and person because she is much more interested in praise, acceptance, and approval from New York City, Boston, etc. than from her own husband and children.  Bummer.  Super bummer.  Super confused, lost, brain-dead bummer.<p>I've seen such things far too often before:  Some of these women are totally beyond belief.  In their teens and twenties, they can work harder and go with less sleep than any man could ever hope to approach.  They have fantastic rote memories.  Their abilities at detail work of dotting i's and crossing t's is astounding, bested only by computers.  They can zip through humanities subjects, especially novels, with blinding speed and get A+ on a corresponding test with discussion questions.  Their social skills can be somewhat mechanical and analytical (not like 'Miss Congeniality') but far, far better than any man could every hope to understand.  There are usually close associations with anxiety, perfectionism, and even obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Finally, the thinking is usually quite distant from reality; e.g., they don't see that they are neglecting what is important, their home, for nonsense on the other side of the country.  That is, they don't have good life goals and work hard for them; instead they have compulsions, that is, things they do to near exhaustion without knowing why.<p>Finally, they are not willing to get their happiness from their home and their security from joining with their husband to ""take on the world together"" and, instead, want to be full of anxiety from feeling persecuted by men, thus, want to compete with men and beat men 'in their own game', etc.  Brain-dead.<p>For all their PBK, etc. accomplishments, they actually are not 'smart' but dumb.  I've seen far too many.",1310026979

Then we loop over every module & make sure they were all required at least once before instantiating any classes.<p>In CoffeeScript, exporting to `window` is as easy prepending '@' to the class name.

People are creating news websites, tutorial websites and twitter-accounts for G+. People are gaming others to like and follow them on twitter and facebook(!) to get G+ invites (makes sense, eh?). There are already several third-party URL-shorteners dedicated for G+. Why exactly? If G+ is going to be huge, who cares about twitter's 140 char limit? The buzz-machine is working like crazy and people are desperately trying to cling on to what's hot right now, even though it doesn't internally or externally make any sense. Expectations are way high and are still going up, up trough the roof.<p>G+ seems 100% marketing-driven at this point, just look at the demo-material. In the Circles video they even say ""You take a chance on people, because they take a chance on you"". For a feature which lets you put a user in a list. This is Apple-grade marketing BS, so it's hard to not think the overall deployment strategy with the associated buzz is intentional.<p>I'm however starting to doubt if G+ will be able to deliver on the expectations being created for it. They are just going way too high now.<p>Although probably not as bad, this is definitely moving into Wave-land. People had to go trough hell and back to get Wave-invites, but they went trough whatever crazy means they had to, and once they got there the response was ""This is it""?<p>Unless G+ can really deliver, it might end up the same.",1310025719

Tito here from OpenPCR. That's a fantastic question! The typical use case for PCR is ""doing stuff with DNA"" along the lines of what you read on the wiki page about PCR.
We hope that OpenpCR will enable <i>new</i> uses of PCR, where perhaps the user doesn't need to know much about DNA. What if PCR could ""tell you whether you have the flu or a cold"", or ""is this sushi really yellowfin tuna"", or ""is this genetically modified corn?"".
What do you think of those apps?<p>Tito",1310025714

Windows 7, .NET, Visual Studio, Office 2007 (Ribbon overhaul), WP7 (though a way to come yet, but tends to get good reviews, particularly for the UI).<p>Just because they are not your personal preference doesn't mean that they aren't good products.",1310025669

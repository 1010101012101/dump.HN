I have long been upset with the US, yet I have long given up on any hope that the US can put itself back on the right path.<p>The idea that damned the US is equality. I'm not talking about equality in the sense of race, gender, ethnicity, etc. I'm talking about the idea of putting everyone on a level playing field so that people's feelings are not hurt---not keeping score in youth sports, substantially dumbing down curricula, etc. This is what will eventually cause the downfall of American civilization. Anyone who will challenge the way things are currently being done will be viewed as a brutish person with an inclination towards intellectual elitism. I already see this happening.",1232855868

He was more tabloid fodder.<p>And no, he didn't make it from the show directly, but the show made his brand name a lot more valuable, and made it a lot easier for him to make money from his businesses. And his true worth is probably far less than that. A lot of people claim in the $150m-$250m range. It's hard to estimate a guy whose worth is primarily not in equities.",1232855854

The real why answer is 'because he didn't have anywhere else to place objects in the work area'. The table is one solution.  You could go another layer deep and wonder why the work area was designed without a stable horizontal work surface. Maybe the job duties changed, maybe the designers didn't know.

Bingo Card Creator, which is ""pretty freaking simple"" as far as software goes (v1.0 got released in 8 days after I had the idea to do so, and half of that time was spent on tasks other than programming), has been under development for 2.5 years.  I just released v2.51 and, sure enough, found things to improve about it.  I've already got an extensive list for what to add for v3.0.<p>My website has also been out for 2.5 years, and there are a million things to do there, too.  It rained yesterday, and accordingly I scratched something off my rainy day list: implemented a serial key lookup.  It is a minor little snit of a feature that will only be used by probably 5 people, saving me 15 minutes, a month.  But when you aggregate those by the dozens, they are really meaningful.<p>My advice isn't just finish it.  It is ""just launch it"".  You'll have all the time in the world to improve the software later -- start getting users and feedback for it today.  (Oh, and charge money, starting at launch.)",1232855285

448671,comment,446165,448023,0,0,mindslight,,,"> Why would my management ask me to work 10 extra hours a week? What does that have to do with deflation?<p>You're advocating a system which discourages saving. I'm pointing out a situation where lack of savings has a negative consequences for quality of life.<p>> Where is all the consumer inflation that they are allegedly creating?<p>The fundamental problem with inflationary policy is that it makes it so that dollars from the past purchase <i>less</i> food today than they would have previously, even though it is much easier to produce food today. You're calling it ""consumer inflation"" to avoid the glaring fact that every widget that has gotten easier to produce but yet remains the same price represents pure inflation. And as the rate of technological progress increases, this gap will grow ever larger.<p>> Yes they would, because we are entering a potential depression. Smoothing out means cutting when things are bad and increasing when things are good. You have to act at both ends to achieve stable prices.<p>But the fact they've hit zero shows that the average target has been chosen incorrectly over multiple cycles. Negative isn't just a curious property of a freely-tunable parameter - it's <i>paying</i> borrowers to take on debt with the hope that they'll spend it on something.. anything.. please?<p>Investors are understandably weary, and low rates can only mitigate this to an extent. Worthy investments would still be made with 1-2% rates, lower rates only perpetuate ""no money down"" and ""users first profitability second"" wishful thinking. The only thing that will fix general confidence is time.<p>> What evidence do you have that central banks have departed from their mandated inflation targeting regime?<p>I can't really claim that the central banks have deviated from their stated goal, when their stated goal is to devalue the currency as much as they can without pissing consumers off.<p>2002-2004. These were good times, yet the rate is solid at the lower end of the scale. A war <i>should</i> make creditors cautious, but rates were kept low to avoid any kind of economic slowdown that would make people realize an elective aggressive war has consequences.<p>The fact we're now talking about paying borrowers to take loans is <i>precisely</i> the consequence of failing to to keep the rates high enough.<p>> What do you mean when you say the economy is 'driven'?<p>Driven - Stimulated by an external source (rather than being left to steady-state)<p>> Sustainability is entirely orthogonal to monetary policy.<p>You haven't addressed my point. You can't claim it a virtue to lift masses out of poverty if they have the same proportion of wealth and the increased magnitude only comes from depleting natural resources as fast as possible. When the price of resource extraction goes up, the economy will slow back down, and they'll be left in deeper poverty.<p>> Why do you say they are the second?<p>The borrower pays the bank for the privilege of having access to the newly printed money. If the bank did not have first stab at the money, they wouldn't be able to attach their own conditions. Capiche?<p>> Your last part shows you don't understand the economic laws of nominal pricing<p>No, you're making an invalid assertion that the immediate consumer supply is fixed. By raising the prices of goods through monetary inflation, you short circuit the proper path which involves reduced demand for employment.<p>> Many people have created alternative currency systems<p>And they're allowed to exist as long as they stay local curiosities. When they grow and start attracting widespread attention, they are raided and neutered like Liberty Dollar and E-gold.",1232852872

I mean, how many social networking sites or ad management companies do we need.  It is way more competitive, because it is so easy to start a web site now.<p>Another series is on what hasn't changed.  Still the VCs desire for stellar CEOs.

Everyone can agree on the crap, but can you share examples of code that you liked that might help me triangulate on your aesthetics. Alternatively, I&#x27;d be interested to hear if my published projects are pleasant or not.

Code shouldn&#x27;t have to be perfectly designed to be readable, and nobody should have to wade through utter crap either. Very often code starts out nice when it has one author or three, and gradually turns to crap as more cooks are added. I want to eliminate that dependency on author churn, to have it be beautiful or ugly based on the capabilities of the programmers involved, not on the difficulty they had understanding those who came before. To make progress on this project, I find it most valuable to utterly ignore aesthetics.",1410559028

8310683,comment,8309490,8309954,1,0,travisp,,,"It&#x27;s true that large firms and NPEs hold the patents and can better enforce their patents, but &quot;patent trolls&quot; (aka patent license companies that specialize in holding and enforcing patent rights as a business model) can be in some ways a benefit to smaller firms for a couple of reasons:<p>1) The smaller firms don&#x27;t have the ability to aggressively defend their patents against larger competitors (and would simply have their invention used by the big players without a patent). Instead, the smaller firm can essentially outsource this to a patent licensing firm that specializes in it (standard division of labor), for example selling the patent while maintaining a license to use it themselves (or any other of a multitude of arrangements that essentially let them fight the big players).<p>2) If the smaller firm doesn&#x27;t have the resources to actually introduce and sell their invention in the marketplace, they can sell it to a patent licensing firm that can use the patent within their portfolio to license to the main players in the market. This could arise when, for example, the small company comes up with an important new innovation in smartphones, but the small company lacks the resources to actually create a viable physical product on its own.",1410558979

In the meantime, they&#x27;re doing work elsewhere, although are hoping not to permanently work there; they&#x27;re hoping that Uber will cave in.<p>Denial of labour (&quot;striking&quot;) is a tried-and-tested approach to persuading companies to do what the labourers want. They can&#x27;t operate without labour, so labourers organise to deny them that until they get better working conditions/better pay/etc.<p>Assuming enough labourers agree to deny labour, this will work unless (a) what the labourers want, the company literally cannot provide without going bust, or (b) there are enough people looking for jobs and willing to put up with the bad terms that the company can hire them to replace the striking labourers.<p>This is a relatively simple idea, and has been a thing since the Industrial Revolution; I&#x27;m not really sure what you&#x27;re not getting.",1410558916

He doesn&#x27;t always explicitly indicate who, but, as the article says, everything he wrote (and sometimes said) was a clue to what he was thinking. He was trying to make sense of an entire history and an entire world by organising how a particular concept was handed down from author to author and how it was mutated.<p>Why is this of value to us?

Does it really require an ambulance and a fire truck for many of the minor injuries? It seems a waste to drive a very fuel-inefficient fire engine to something where the additional personnel are not needed.<p>While there are some calls for emergency medical assistance that can easily be handled with just the two personnel on the ambulance, there are many that require additional help.  Nearly every EMS system sends a unit to “back” the ambulance for a number of reasons.  First, nearly every life threatening emergency incident is best handled with at least two paramedics in addition to the driver.  Second, there is not always enough reliable information on the patient condition to determine if additional help is needed. Valuable time may be lost if additional personnel are not dispatched until the ambulance arrives and makes an assessment. Finally, even so called “routine” medical calls often require the patient to be lifted into the back of the ambulance.  Even if the patient is not obese, it is safer for the patient and for the backs of the medics to have additional help to lift.<p>When the fire truck is not needed on an incident, it is released to go back into service as soon as possible. The cost of the fuel to have the extra help immediately available when it is needed is a small cost when compared to the loss of precious minutes when a life is on the line.&quot;",1410557964

I do this and many of the people I speak with do this.<p>You talk about full-time classes and a full-time job.  Actually some of my classmates are raising children or that sort of thing as well.  But beyond that, you&#x27;re correct that it is hard to take a hard STEM major full-time and also work full-time.  It would be almost impossible to maintain a 4.0 or 3.9 or whatnot.  The solution is obvious, don&#x27;t take a full course load - take three classes a semester, or perhaps two, or perhaps one.

Maybe that&#x27;s the wrong paradigm, but man, there&#x27;s got to be a better way to read code that lends itself to understanding what&#x27;s going on. Even though my IDE can &quot;find usages&quot; and I can set breakpoints and step through things, the breakpoints get hit so fast that it&#x27;s hard to internalize things before hitting &quot;play&quot; again.

If money issues are hindering your education, then it&#x27;s easy to justify that.<p>Listen, Uber is an example: Not playing by the rules makes it easier to win and when you do a few will complain about your lack of ethics but only a tiny fraction will make that count against you.<p>JustFab? You may be upset about dark patterns but people love them. Apple, Google, et. al. intentionally breaking the law? No one cares, people still want to work for them. Intel&#x27;s illegal anti-competition activities? Microsoft&#x27;s? People still love them.<p>No one cares about the guy who worked his ass off so he could afford a book, if that work cut into the time needed to study, leaving him less educated. People celebrate the guy who, having pirated books, was able to concentrate on learning and has the free time to become better at many other things.",1410555848

Further, as a grantee of privileged access, you know that. You know you can&#x27;t just say it must have been one of the 200 others with the common key. So it&#x27;s more invisible prevention than measurable solving.<p>That&#x27;s a big &quot;if&quot;, though, and in the article, Stallman points out that MIT isn&#x27;t able to actually show that it&#x27;s a realistic reason to encourage this sort of surveillance.<p>I feel like there&#x27;s a middle ground here -- for example, card readers could store a hash of an on-card identifier, one that the security staff do <i>not</i> have access to in normal student records. In exceptional circumstances, you could de-blind the logs and see if a single person was in the building at a given time or not, but there wouldn&#x27;t be surveillance and the logs would be useless in the typical case.<p>A card swipe doesn&#x27;t show that you&#x27;re there, though.

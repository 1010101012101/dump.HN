We each get x% of the others' proceeds if we're a founder at a company that has an exit. So it increases our chances of seeing a payout and decreases that payout by x% (but x is small.) Ideally we'd have a couple more good friends-who-are-equally-likely-to-be-founders join in, and we'd really have a good pool...",1256972305
913340,comment,913259,913325,0,0,weaksauce,,,"I remember reading a study done about doodlers and their retention rates. The study found that people who doodle when listening had a higher retention rate of the information. I cannot remember where I read it so I don't know how rigorous the study was though. But this seems in line with your anecdotal evidence.",1256972269

What if the worst is true and they are right? A small percentage of children vaccinated become autistic. Is that worse than 21,269 (American, many more globally) children per year left with mild to disabling paralysis from polio? Measles, mumps, rubella, Tetanus, Diphtheria?<p>As hard as it might sound, even if the current vaccines actually <i>are</i> harmful to some very small number of children, <i>we should still do it</i>. The alternative is much worse.",1256972167

We long ago developed this ability to an even greater extent than any other animal on our planet, and we are still further developing this ability.<p>So, in dropping a <i>mindless</i> ""meat probe"", he's experimenting with something that isn't really human. It isn't bringing resources with it, or building shelter, or altering its environment. He's instead artificially limiting the terms of the experiment to environments that are between 40 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit, with arable soil, no predators, and readily available food and (clean) freshwater sources.<p>Well, hell, under those conditions, many of the places that we live today aren't supposed to be habitable.",1256971767
913336,comment,912554,912554,0,0,hooande,,,"I think this is how most equity investing works anyway. You get the feeling that one or more of the founders are ""superstars"" and decide to back them, not the idea or product that they pitched you with.<p>The lifetime contract is an interesting spin. Kind of reminds me of a classical artist having a patron. It's a great deal from the perspective of the individual...3% is always a trivial amount of your income. I do worry about it from the investment perspective...it seems way too easy to let personal biases and an individual's charisma get in the way of making rational investment decisions. While most investments are made on the basis of ""I really like this person"", it probably isn't the best criteria.",1256971749

913325,comment,913259,913259,0,0,mrshoe,,,"I'd like to see more studies related to increased attentiveness while listening to music. All through high school I played tetris on my calculator during class. I swear I could absorb more information while playing tetris than while not playing tetris.<p>The only explanation I could ever imagine is that a small part of my mind was tied up thinking about the game, so I was less prone to day dream while playing. However, I had played so much that I didn't really have to think about it any more, so enough of my brain was free to process what the teacher was saying.<p>This study indicates that something similar is going on while listening to music. I think this could be a powerful discovery.",1256969497

But more often than not it's an inherent complexity in the problem space itself.</i><p>That isn't to say there is only ever one way of performing an action or that it is impossible to make it clearer how to perform a task. And if you make it difficult for users to give you their opinion, it will be that much harder to know what needs to be improved.<p><i>IRC is real-time and ephemeral, which makes it considerably more difficult to engage in conversations with contributors in other time zones, and refer back to design discussions that occurred 5-20 years ago.</i><p>There's not very many projects that date back 20 years ago that also have the complexity that you're talking about. X11 and the Linux kernel are the only two I can think of off the top of my head. And I would hope that a 5-20 year old project that's continuously under development would have more documentation than posts from a <i>mailing list</i> about its design.<p><i>I thought we already established that project communication channels are primarily optimized for the project contributors who use them daily, not for once-off questions from end users.</i><p>I would be interested in seeing how many projects — open source in this case — have > 1 or 2 contributors.<p>I may be off base, but I'd guess that you're optimizing towards large, highly visible projects and not the small, norm of an open source project.",1256969093

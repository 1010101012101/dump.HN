The idea is that it's an investment to be recouped for various workloads due to the improved ability to exploit concurrency over a GIL-ful interpreter.<p>And really, it's at the proof of concept stage right now, hardly optimized.

4166633,comment,4164731,4164731,4,0,pcowans,,,"Just a couple of observations based on experience:<p>- You'll most likely run out of power well before you run out of physical rack space.<p>- You'll (hopefully) spend less time in the data centre than you think, especially if you have good lights out access, remote power bar access etc. If you're locating in a large city you can often get a better deal somewhere in the suburbs rather than downtown with very little downside (at least that seems to be the case here in London).<p>- Interconnects between racks can be awkward to get set up, and you can't necessarily get the rack next door when you want more space.<p>- Redundant everything will save you a lot of hassle, but gets quite expensive. In particular redundant power will save you from downtime when the data centre decide they need to take one of the power feeds down for maintenance (it happens), and setting up redundant (external) networking has the same effect. Having a second network for admin access prevents you from being locked out in some failure cases. Hot swappable drives are useful for systems which are awkward to take offline (e.g. database servers), but not massively useful elsewhere if you have good redundancy at the server level.<p>- Data centre rack floors are about the most unpleasant place to work you can imagine :-)<p>- If you can get a handle for how competent the data centre are at mitigating DoS attacks it's a useful datapoint. If they aren't on the ball an attack against anyone hosted in the same place will take you offline too. having said that, I'm not entirely sure there's a fool-proof way to determine this ahead of time.<p>- You can generally borrow a cart with a keyboard and monitor on it to wheel up to your rack, so no need to have those permanently installed.<p>- Keep a stash of network cables, cable ties etc. at the bottom of your rack - it's annoying to show up only to find you've forgotten that kind of thing.<p>- You may need to register authorised employees before showing up, so make sure you do that before taking your new intern to help rack a server. Expect them to ask for ID before letting you in.<p>- Data centres (at least some of them) will take deliveries on your behalf, so there's normally no need to get things shipped to your office then drive them out yourself.",1340801451

We were headed towards much higher-performance implementations of the language, with additional powerful features like sandboxing and JIT, and it was set back years by the 3.X schism.<p>I don't see how the 3.x changes have set back PyPy ""by years"". PyPy was focussing exclusively on 2.x until very recently, and made its last big steps towards production-readyness entirely undisturbed by the 3.x transition. As of a couple of months ago they now have a small team working on 3.x support, which has made huge progress in a short time frame and doesn't seem to have detracted from progress in the core and further 2.x release at all as far as I can see.<p>> Furthermore, the continued complication of the language makes it ever less likely that core problems like the GIL will ever be fixed.<p>Ironically, specifically the oh-so-handicapped PyPy is currently working on a new approach to address the GIL with their transactional memory work. And the language has gotten <i>less</i> complicated with 3.x, not more.<p>> I still hope against hope that there will be a Python 4 that brings backward compatibility and GIL removal.

4166588,comment,4165844,4166025,7,0,dmbaggett,,,"Amen. Python 3 has created an incredible amount of work in the aggregate for the authors of all the 2.X libraries that must be ported. Even worse, libraries that are no longer actively maintained must now be taken over by someone new and ported. All for new language features of very dubious value. If Python 3 brought us real threading with no GIL, that would be worth the pain. But instead, we get removal of a few warts and backward-incompatibility. One can only imagine how much damage the years of incompatibility and confusion caused by this decision have curtailed the popularity of the language. 2to3 is impressive and useful for implementating arbitrary code transformations, but obviously it can't magically make old code handle bytes/chars/unicode properly from a semantic standpoint.<p>And think about how the 3.X changes totally screwed the Jython and PyPy (and Cython, and IronPython, and...) teams. We were headed towards much higher-performance implementations of the language, with additional powerful features like sandboxing and JIT, and it was set back years by the 3.X schism. Furthermore, the continued complication of the language makes it ever less likely that core problems like the GIL will ever be fixed. (Yes, I know Jython and IronPython are GIL-free.)<p>My startup relies heavily on Python, and the only reason I don't seriously regret choosing Python as a core technology is that there was nothing else better at the time. The Python overlords have reduced the language to the best of bad options; it didn't have to be this way. FAIL.<p>I still hope against hope that there will be a Python 4 that brings backward compatibility and GIL removal. But since none of the overlords seem to care about either of these goals, and since both get harder with every new Python 3 release, it's probably just my own sad little fantasy.",1340800544

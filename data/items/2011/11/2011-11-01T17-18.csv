Let's have some perspective:<p>I wake up every morning. Unlike 90% of this country, <i>I have no hard deadline</i> on when I have to be at work. Unlike most of the country, I also have effectively no limits on what to wear. I can stroll in with shorts and sandals if I so feel like. I get paid well into the six figures to work on things I love. I get free food, luxurious shuttles to ferry my ass around, and in my post-lunch drowsiness (that most of the country can ill afford to even contemplate), I have hammocks to nap in. I have benefits that much of the country would commit bloody murder for. There are things that are expensable which would appear shockingly excessive to any other industry. I attend ridiculously funded parties fueled by my company's largesse, and my office is one of the coolest places in town, because shit, burning through VC cash is fun.<p>And somehow, in the midst of all of that, you decide there's a penny-pinching CEO character who's being all Scrooge McDuck-like and actively plotting to screw you out of your hard-earned money.<p>Really.<p>Sometimes I feel like software engineers, particularly in the Bay Area, have the most over-inflated sense of entitlement I've seen <i>anywhere</i>. I'm all for extracting a fair slice of the value I generate for my employer, but come <i>on</i>, this straw man helps no one. It's has shades of Wall Street greed - we're sitting around, our giant paychecks in one hand, our catered organic/fair trade free food in the other, and loudly complain that we're <i>worth more than this</i>.",1320170230

He does not observe racism to be a significant problem and thus concludes that racism is not prevalent or relevant today. You argue that k33n's race is irrelevant to his reasoning.<p>Both of you are incorrect. We have two hypotheses: racism either is or is not a relevant problem. And, we have that k33n does not observe much racism. We (and k33n) should update our beliefs based on the ratio P(k33n does not observe racism|racism is not relevant)/P(k33n does not observe racism|racism is relevant). The value of this ratio depends on k33n's race. If k33n is white, he's unlikely to observe much racism in either case, and the ratio's value is close to 1. If k33n is black, he's much more likely to not observe racism if racism is not prevalent, so the ratio's value is high and useful for updating beliefs.<p>You're also arguing that we ought not conclude that someone cannot understand racism simply because they are white. I agree with you, but I don't think that's the issue here. The issue is that k33n is white and seems to glibly conclude that racism isn't a real problem. He couldn't have reached this conclusion by looking at statistics because, as you know, the statistics push you toward the opposition conclusion. So, he probably came to this conclusion because he observed that racism isn't a problem for him personally. In doing so, he was being unreasonable and somewhat callous.",1320169273

3183118,comment,3181177,3182279,11,0,dgreensp,,,"I think this mini-debate is a clash of personal values more than anything else.<p>Jacques is essentially saying, ""I'm a programmer, and I'm secure in that.  Even when I'm just gluing existing code together, I'm damn good at it.  I know that being a programmer who hacks code, first and foremost, doesn't make me a replaceable cog.""<p>Others are not satisfied to think of themselves as doing gritty work that is not always an act of creative expression or a uniquely inspired solution.  If I'm just wiring stuff together, the thought goes, surely anyone can do that?  Ah, but the creativity lies in the problem solving, and that's what the employer/client cares about anyway.  So I'm a problem-solver, first, and a programmer second.<p>I think some people are happy to be ""just programmers"" or ""programmers first"" and others are ""programmers second.""<p>In reality, there aren't two different jobs called ""Software Engineer"" and ""Programmer"" across companies, though glamour of title may be a hint as to how a company values and treats their programmers/engineers.  If you have 20 years of programming experience and are hired to write code, you're a programmer by default.  Whether the work is dull or interesting, creative or rote, or paints you as an ""artiste"" or a ""cog in a machine"" depends on the job rather than what you call yourself.<p>It can't hurt to bill yourself as a problem-solver with business and entrepreneurial savvy, etc., as companies will always say they want people with iniative and higher-level thinking, even if they aren't prepared to let you exercise it.  Put another way, no potential employer is going to say, ""We're looking for a programmer, but it says here you're an engineer.  Are you sure you're not over-qualified for this position?""  Your self-given title won't save you.  On the flip side, a good company looking for highly creative engineers will know that many of them call themselves ""programmers.""<p>In summary, I see the ""don't call yourself a programmer"" advice as coming out of fear of being a replaceable menial worker, more than reflecting any reality about hiring practices or the deep nature of programming.  Jacques's argument is, ""Programming can be pretty menial sometimes, but good programmers are hard to replace.  So avoid the duller work, and solve people's problems, and you can have a happy, highly-paid career.""",1320168522

Mathematical proof of very large software systems may presently be impractical; the verification procedures currently in place for avionics systems are pretty daunting as they stand.<p>I'm not sure what we would gain from an overall software engineering professional qualification. While I am quick to point to avionics development as (in my opinion) being true software engineering, I also acknowledge that a great deal of software is not built using any methods even remotely as rigorous. But then, it also probably doesn't need to be.<p>You put a lot more rigor into building a house for people than you do a house for dogs, and you put a lot more rigor into building a skyscraper office building than you do a house. And rightly so. Each needs to withstand different levels of pressure. I see no reason to apply rigorous engineering processes to iPhone games; it would be a waste of time and resources.<p>As it is, the industries that require rigorous software development have produced their own standards. I suppose if you could ascertain the similarities across industries and codify that into general software engineering practices, that could be a good thing, but you'd probably still need industry-specific regulations to make sure nothing was missed.<p>I dunno.

If they did, why would you want to work for them? There are companies who are desperate for good programmers and recognize that good programmers are hard to come by. Negotiating with them is much less adversarial, I assure you.<p>I don't disagree with a lot of what you're saying. I think we can both agree that a good programmer understands their role in the business and should view their practice holistically as a part of a much bigger entity. However, I don't think that people universally see programmers as overly-paid gurus or what-have-you. Assuming they want skilled programmers to work for them, why would they look for replaceable cogs and peons?<p>The true cost of hiring those kinds of programmers will not be apparent until 5 years down the road when you're spending 80% of your budget and time fixing bugs and putting out fires from pissed off client who cannot believe you would ship them such a shoddy product.<p>Again.. maybe there are people in the world who still do not know what a programmer does or the value of hiring good programmers. I would argue that they're probably in the minority or hiring for a position that doesn't require a lot of skill. In that case perhaps Patrick is right -- but again, why would you want to work for them unless you're desperate to fill in your H1B requirements or you're straight out of school and have no experience.

We've been focused on TV applications on Connected TV's (Yahoo Widgets, Samsung SmartHub) and Over the Top Boxes (Roku/Boxee/GoogleTV) but have been moving to doing more mobile work (particularly on tablets) and some traditional web (most of our web work is for web services which power out TV and tablet apps instead of consumer facing web apps).  This is a bespoke design and development business.  We've worked with CBS/NBC/Comcast/The UFC and others.<p>WHAT WE NEED
We currently have a few inbound projects which may exceed our current capacity so we're looking for a few contract folks to help bridge the gap. We tend to prefer local folks (SF, NY and we have some folks in Cleveland) though we will go remote for the right fit.<p>PRIMARY TECHNOLOGIES
Our two most pressing needs are for frontend Javascript folks and Android Folks.  On the JS side we do full Rich Internet Apps on TVs our main libraries are Jquery and Backbone.  On the Android side we actually have a few inbound tablet projects and may have some work on the new GoogleTV platform (V2).<p>When we do backend work we like Rails, we've played with Node/Redis/MongoDB - we think this may be a good stack for some projects, and we sometimes have to deliver apps in PHP. We're really technology agnostic. Because we do bespoke, project based development we can't afford to be tied too much to specific technologies. We use the best tool for the job when we can, and sometimes we use the technology we're told to use. Thats the nature of our business.<p>You can reach me at mike AT a different engine DOT com with questions or even just to chat ;-)",1320168469

These days, we mostly connect computers to the radio to do logging and morse code keying (done through the LPT port).  One popular program runs under windows.  The big boys use another program that runs under DOS, and lately FreeDOS as a replacement.  Running under windows, there is an annoying hesitation once every word or so that is due to whatever is going on in  windows.<p>The solution, provided by the maker of the above-mentioned windows software is an external keying module. With this arrangement, windows sends characters to the hardware brick, which, latency-free, sends out the characters quite nicely. (Amazing how the trained morse-code ear can distinguish ms delays in character starts.)<p>Personally, I now think that way where a system has a component that is latency rich connected to a component that is latency-free.

I understand anecdote is not data but I have a personal collection of self-experienced anecdotes ,spanning multiple years and client.<p>I work as an outsourced contracted consultant on a client which outsources to 2 outsourcing firms A(Indian) and B(Native). I work for firm A. Client  had a seemingly untraceable problem which was not solved for more than a year.CTO personally used to come to my managers desk and express his frustration of not able to resolve the issues. End users were constantly complaining to him. So task force was prepared to which used to meet every day for hours and talk in circles with no resolution. They were not even able to devise an attack plan. I have some reputation for tackling this kind of stuff so they persuaded my managers and started inviting me to their meetings.<p>After couple of days of investigation I was able to devise a plan and find out the root cause and resolution to the problem. Actual was hilarious and sad at the same time. It was a bigger issue with overall design of the datacentres which was originally designed by vendor B. Millions were wasted because someone failed to understand how TCP/IP layers interact with each other.<p>I know communication is important so I kept everyone updated and prepared a detailed analysis in doc and ppt format. The moment my analysis was out, guess what Vendor B tried to blame internet for not behaving to make his solution work and client rallied behind him. When I shot down his bullshit argument , me and my firm were taken out of loop and separate meetings with vendor B started to propose potentials solutions. After couple of months of proposing bullshit they again came to us and we provided the solution. Guess what ? We were out of the loop again and solution implementation started by hiring a third vendor C(Native again!!) along with vendor B.",1320167023

3182988,comment,3181629,3181629,23,0,scarmig,,,"Just to get it out of the way: no one who has ever posted on Hacker News or has ever been even slightly associated with the Bay Area tech scene is the least bit racist. We are all 100.0000% meritocratic, and when we popped out of the womb we were instantly the most color-blind people in history. This is a given, and anyone who would say otherwise is a whiner who's just too lazy and stupid to code. (This, by the way, is also how we know that people here are not at all sexist or homophobic and have highly progressive views on gender. We're just that good.)<p>Now that that's out of the way, we can talk about the role of race in tech. I think it'd be useful to divide it into four categories.<p>1) Race as felt through through social structure. Minorities (defined as AA, Native American, and Latinos) have less access to educational resources than other ethnicities. This is a broader social injustice, and tech can't be held responsible for it. Tech is also hard at work to help mitigate this problem, though with varying levels of success.<p>2) Race as felt through choice of majors. Minorities disproportionately choose not to major in techy fields. This is in large part due to a combination of 1) and 3) (to follow). Even to the extent that minorities do have access to high quality education, it tends to be more liberal arts and non-techy. Minorities may also perceive that the tech scene tends to be less friendly toward them.<p>3) Race as felt through network effects. This, I think, is probably the biggest cause of the recent complaints. Everyone knows here how valuable having their social community overlap at least somewhat with the tech community is. Knowing someone who knows someone is how you get jobs and get involved in new projects. And you learn a whole lot through these informal interactions (having no CS background, I only learned about Lisp on a date).<p>People whom we know are usually of similar racial and class backgrounds. Not through any conscious decisions, but because of shared interests and the fact that people make friends through other nodes in their own social networks, nodes that have the same tendency of showing race and class similarity.<p>4) Racist prejudice. Examples of this are the null set, because no one here is at all racist.<p>In the end, though, 3) builds off of itself. You start out as an isolated island, and if you don't break out of it you'll never achieve your full potential. Once you do get pulled into it, though, the sky's the limit.<p>The question we should be asking is how to deal with 3).",1320166933

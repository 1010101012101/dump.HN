8417543,comment,8416853,8416853,0,0,smacktoward,,,"What&#x27;s interesting about this story is that it starts out seemingly like it&#x27;s going to be about devious marketers devising a way to turn a product nobody wanted into a hot seller strictly through marketing, in much the same way that clever marketing turned the universally reviled Patagonian toothfish into a big seller by bestowing upon it the more upscale name &quot;Chilean sea bass&quot; (see <a href=""http://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-chilean-sea-bass/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://priceonomics.com/the-invention-of-the-chilean-sea-bas...</a>).<p>But then you get into the meat of it (sorry) and find that the root of the turnaround is an actual technical accomplishment -- a method to cook and distribute pre-cooked bacon that wouldn&#x27;t rob the bacon of its flavor:<p><i>> The early 1990s was a time of great advancements in precooked bacon technology. Pork producers, food labs, and agricultural schools such as Iowa State University began investing substantially in precooked R&D. Hormel and Swift worked on microwaveable precooked slices for home consumers, while Chicago’s OSI and the now-defunct Wilson Foods poured their efforts into bacon spirals that would fit perfectly atop a hamburger.</i><p>These technical innovations turned out to be the key, because the pork marketers were pitching bacon to fast-food chains as a &quot;flavor enhancer,&quot; but the chains that tried it mostly came away dissatisfied: the hassle of adding bacon-cooking to their highly regimented kitchens created expense and added time to the burger-assembly process, while existing methods for pre-cooking bacon yielded a tasteless product. Pre-cooked bacon with taste intact (that came in shapes ready to plop on top of a hamburger patty, no less) took all that friction away.<p>My only regret is that the whole thing is written from the perspective of the Pork Marketing Board, which funded the research into pre-cooking bacon, but doesn&#x27;t really tell you much about the research itself. That seems like it&#x27;d be an interesting story, for those of a technical bent; here&#x27;s a problem, how do you solve it?",1412621985

MSN Messenger (later &quot;Live Messenger&quot; &quot;.Net Messenger Service&quot;) didn&#x27;t exist yet (1999) and while Windows had something called Netmeeting it was simply terrible.<p>ICQ technically came around before AIM, being released in 1996 Vs. 1997 but AIM hit the ground running as AOL hooked up their massive (then) subscriber base. So while AIM was a more popular service, ICQ became popular with a certain more savvy class of user (e.g. tech&#x27; nerds, who wanted more functionality, and something NOT tied to their email address).<p>ICQ offered that. Less ads, more features, and slightly anonymous (ICQ numbers). ICQ sucks by todays&#x27; standards, but in 1996-1999 it was really competing with AIM. There&#x27;s also Yahoo! Messenger that came out in 1998 which was fairly popular (particularly as an &quot;AIM replacement&quot;).<p>ICQ just somehow remained popular in certain parts of the world for the same reason Facebook isn&#x27;t going away: It reached a critical mass, now &quot;everyone&quot; is using it which means &quot;everyone&quot; has to continue using it...",1412621864

I feel like the author&#x27;s main point is that there seems to be a higher abundance of toxic interactions in Open Source than other communities.<p>I&#x27;m not the same person you responded to, but regardless I&#x27;d argue that there probably isn&#x27;t much more toxic interactions in open-source then there is in any other communities. People tend to fight and get angry over stuff they care about, that happens everywhere. The thing with open-source is that all of those communications are open, and thus it&#x27;s much easier to see.<p>The thing is though, how many times do you think anybody on here has actually looked at the Linux Kernel mailing list for a reason other then a post on here about Linus getting angry? I&#x27;d wager not many. Everybody loves to see a good fight, but it&#x27;s rare to see someone being helpful and nice highlighted. I&#x27;ve only seen one post on HN highlighting Linus being nice and helpful, even though that&#x27;s the bulk of the posts he makes, and I see one <i>every time</i> he gets angry. For example, looking at some ones he sent yesterday, I&#x27;m seeing this (<a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/96"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/96</a>), this (<a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/112</a>), and this (<a href=""https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/107"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/10/5/107</a>), all of which are generally nice and well mannered questions, and explanations of things people may need to do differently.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Open Source community is nearly as toxic as people make it out to be.",1412621357

In my experience, that typically favors the kinds of abusive personalities who have discovered some easily-exploited aspect of the social system to simultaneously provide cover for their own bad behavior while limiting their target&#x27;s ability to retaliate.<p>If I were on a team stuck with this guy, and required by professional norms to bite my tongue, I can safely say I&#x27;d take supreme satisfaction in seeing such a nasty employee get this severely excoriated.

This is because companies have no desire to ruin someone&#x27;s future employment prospects by broadcasting to the world that they were fired. In return, the polite expectation is that the employee will not go shooting their mouth off about the company especially (as in your case) through irresponsibly unfounded speculation. Signing a non-disparagement indicates that you have no intention to do this, so the company can then say &quot;Ok, if anyone comes asking for a reference on this guy, we needn&#x27;t say he was fired, just give a mildly positive reference.&quot; Even if you don&#x27;t sign the non-disparagement, the company will give you the benefit of the doubt and not disparage you or make any negative statements first. Unfortunately, you have just forfeited this arrangement.&quot; -Yishan to former employee",1412620952

So at the high end, what remains after killing off HPPA, the Alpha, Tru64?<p>HP-UX and NonStop on Itanium? I am not being sarcastic, I am seriously asking. My impression so far is that Itanium is either slowly going down (Microsoft and Red Hat stopped porting their systems to IA64 a couple of years back) or simply replacing what HPPA used to be - but in that case it would appear they burnt a whole lot of money for nothing, except that now they are depending on an outside vendor. And Intel, as far as I can tell, does not seem to like Itanium too much, HP seems to be the only company buying them in substantial numbers, and there were already rumors Intel would cease development of IA64.<p>So where is all this going? Would it make sense for HP to buy the Itanium from Intel and continue developing and building them on their own? Could they pull it off as far as engineering and manufacturing go? Would it make sense to port HP-UX and NonStop to some other architecture?",1412620933

I could only find one petition sardonically suggesting for him to stop developing &quot;useless&quot; software, however... another counter-petition later ended up emerging in his support (<a href=""https://www.change.org/p/lennart-poettering-continue-writing-useful-programs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.change.org/p/lennart-poettering-continue-writing...</a>). In addition, Ulrich Drepper has received <i>plenty</i> of bug reports that all scolded his behavior, and even Linus Torvalds was the subject of a petition concerning removing RdRand from /dev/random. Point is: controversial people are controversial.<p>He then goes on to mention the website about boycotting systemd. It&#x27;s fairly obvious that systemd is a highly controversial piece of software, so arguments against it are expected. I agree that the presentation is pretty off-putting and confrontational, but I didn&#x27;t see any &quot;personal attacks&quot;.<p>However, the part about hiring a hitman through Bitcoin <i>really</i> caught my attention. That does sound awful, so I decided to look into it a bit.<p>As it turns out, the story is actually much more tame. What happened was that a few Maemo developers on IRC were angry over the Consistent Network Device Naming feature of udev, trash talked a bit and then went on to different technical topics. After some irrelevant fare, the topic was raised again with the timestamps between 18:21:51 and 20:04:59.<p>There is no grand plot to kill Lennart. In fact, the word &quot;Bitcoin&quot; was mentioned only once. It&#x27;s a bunch of developers acting facetious and trash talking, and it&#x27;s all absolutely baseless. I have no idea why Lennart brought it up.

I know what the article is talking about. The article is talking about an implicit right to silence created by the Miranda decision that the court found to be necessary to protect people, and its gradual erosion.<p>&quot; and the gist ever since is that one must invoke the Fifth in order to be perceived as protected by the Fifth at that time. That&#x27;s what the article is about.&quot;<p>See above<p>It is only in the past 50 years that any court has ever held the fifth amendment gave you the right to remain silent, and in fact, precedent was the exact opposite for centuries.<p>You are of course, welcome to look up the caselaw history if you don&#x27;t believe me.<p>It simply was not understood to be a primary constitutional right, contrary to your assertion.  There was not even anything you could invoke. Prosecutors were free to use your silence against you<p>Talking about it as if it has always been an understood part of the fifth amendment does nobody any favors.\nIt hasn&#x27;t.

This is basically a rewrite of Monit in Go, even using the same configuration language that is used in Monit, verbatim.<p>There is no concept of &quot;clean room&quot; in copyright law, the only issue is whether or not substantial copying has occurred. While it may be easier for the author to avoid accidental copying if he has never looked at the Monit source code, having seen it, being inspired by its design, or deliberately building a compatible system do not constitute copying. The notion that it must be copying simply because it uses the same configuration language is without merit, due to the fact that the configuration language itself is not a creative work and is not eligible for copyright protection, in the same way that an API or a programming language is not eligible for such protection: it is a medium for expression, not an expression in itself - otherwise all programs written in a given programming language would be a derivative work!<p>I suspect that it is this misunderstanding that has led the authors of Monit to file this DMCA takedown, and that they have acted in good faith, but with an insufficient understanding of the limits of what copyright protects.<p>> a. [private] himself admits that Inspeqtor is &quot;heavily influenced“ by Monit<p>Being heavily influenced is not the same as copying. OpenOffice Writer is heavily influenced by Microsoft Word, and can even open the same file format, but it does not copy any of Microsoft&#x27;s source code.<p>> b. This tweet by [private] demonstrate intent. &quot;OSS nerds: redesign and build monit in Go. Sell it commercially. Make $$$$. I will be your first customer.”<p>The quote was &quot;redesign and build Monit in Go&quot; which does not show intent to engage in substantial copying of Monit&#x27;s source code. If anything, it suggests an intent to write a new, redesigned system with its own source code but compatibility with monit.<p>Without looking at the source code, it&#x27;s hard to say more, if the author simply ported the source code of Monit to Go then it would certainly be a derived work, but the DMCA claim doesn&#x27;t mention any such copying. It&#x27;s important to remember that <i>compatibility is not copying</i> and that only the source code to a computer program is covered by copyright - its architecture, design, and even APIs (see Oracle vs Google) are not protected by copyright, because otherwise the copyright claim would effectively behave like a patent, preventing anybody else from creating something conceptually similar.",1412618988

This is the point where parties start complaining about forum invasions, threats, and it spirals out of control. This is where it becomes visible outside the community.<p>When you see the fighting from the outside, it is all noise and no signal.\nBy this time all of the discussion that could be had between parties was already had. The time for legitimate arguments had been passed, and now it is only an emotional clash of personalities and communities.<p>What you don&#x27;t see are all the disagreements and intra-community conflict that never make it to that level and are resolved quietly. These greatly outnumber the knock-down, drag out fights, or at least they never escalate to media attention.<p>I think what we&#x27;re seeing now is not a fundamental shift in the state of online discourse, but rather the changing role social networks and &quot;media outlets&quot; that report on online controversy acting as a delayed amplifier which only fans flames and provides a place to appeal after all context is lost. Social media also enables bandwagoning and cuts across interests but tweets and hashtag oneliners cannot capture the nuance of the lead up to the current conflict.",1412618453

The chilling effect alone, being that I could be sued for simply looking at open source code is disturbing.  Because that&#x27;s what it boils down to.  Most of our software today is a derivative work of something.  I looked at rails code, so does that mean I can never write a web framework lest I be sued?",1412618404

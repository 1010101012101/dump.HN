Really can&#x27;t give it enough credit. Romulus to Augustus to Romulus Augustulus in absolutely loving detail,<p>Revolutions - Mike Duncan&#x27;s (creator of THoR) new project. He&#x27;s just finishing up the French Revolution, already covered the English Civil War and American Revolution. Preparing to go on hiatus to research the Haitan Revolution.<p>The History of Byzantium - Picks up in 476 where THoR left off. Currently in the eighth century with the Byzantines recovering from the Muslim conquests a bit. Different guy, but still very good.<p>12 Byzantine Rulers - Finished this one, it&#x27;s a very short series but gives a nice overview of Byzantine history. Much less in depth than THoB.<p>Norman Centuries - Second project by the 12BR creator, similar concept but covering the Normans. Incredibly interesting, covers the Norman conquests of England, southern Italy, their attacks on the Byzantines, and their crusader state holdings<p>The History of Britain - finished / inactive, it&#x27;s pretty good, but never really hit its stride.<p>/r/AskHistorians podcast - Have only listened to a few episodes. Great content, but I&#x27;m not personally a fan of the format.<p>My list to start is The History of the Crusades, Hardcore History, History of English, History of England, The Lesser Bonapartes, and the BBC inquiry podcast.

This piece though has me scratching my head a little bit.<p>> Apple draws the line at stealing content, and doesn’t see the subversion of ads as stealing – which all of us in the real world know it is. Undermining a publisher’s ability to monetize is stealing, but it’s Robin-Hood, feel-good stealing.<p>This is wrong on so many levels. The ad model relies on the honor system. Yes, the honor system. You are served content and it&#x27;s expected-no, trusted-that whatever you view the content inside will download and show you ads. This business model made sense initially because there was no other way to get people to pay for content on a network that is based around standards versus vendor lock-in when little to no e-commerce was happening or really even possible.<p>As ads became worse and started to require clients download sometimes MORE data than the content they are viewing it&#x27;s only natural the users would fight back against such shitty behavior. This was written about and predicted over 10 years ago and I&#x27;m honestly surprised it has taken so long before people began complaining about it. I remember when some of the first ad blockers became popular and many websites were writing about how this was stealing, the internet was going to die, blah blah blah.<p>Markets change when technology disrupts the status quo. Online advertisement through resource-hogging third-party ads has been the status quo and it has been eroding for quite some time. Why do you think Google makes ads look more and more like search results? Why do you think so many sites are doing &quot;fake content&quot; that&#x27;s basically an ad disguised as content?

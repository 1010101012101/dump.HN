OP - to save yourself some effort, start collecting the addresses of where you&#x27;ve lived and employer info for the past 5-7 years. This is somewhat of a pain if you lived in dorms at school and move back home every summer and into a new dorm in the fall. You&#x27;ll also need references to verify each bit of this info (&quot;Did rathalos work at X from dates Y to Z&quot;), and I think a few character references (&quot;Is rathalos of sound moral character?&quot;, &quot;Do they use drugs?&quot;, etc).<p>On the plus side, you can duplicate references, so if you had a constant roommate just put them down.<p>Polygraphs won&#x27;t apply to what&#x27;s presumably a basic security clearance. There&#x27;s a large cost to clearances and they won&#x27;t get maximum clearance for an intern.<p>Depending on how long it takes to get your clearance, you may only have an interim clearance during your internship. This is probably for the employer to cover themselves if you encountered any sensitive information. It&#x27;s highly unlikely you will be working with sensitive information, unless you go back to intern with them in the future.<p>One benefit of security clearances is that it is transferable, and is good for 2 years after you leave the job (without having to reapply). So you could intern, get a clearance, intern somewhere else next year, and then get a job after graduation that requires a clearance.

If you read the ISDA Master Agreement[1], derivatives can always be netted as there is a provision that exempts derivatives from the usual bankruptcy automatic stays to stop literally this exact threat you posited [2]. Even beyond the bilateral case, the multilateral cases are increasingly cleared through central clearinghouses[4]. But even when they aren&#x27;t, multilateral nets can still be pushed through, in one of two ways: 1) even when Lehman failed, there were some multilateral nets that greatly reduced the exposure, under mutual agreement by all creditors, and 2)The Dodd-Frank Act, since 2009, has also greatly helped this, giving the FDIC and Fed enhanced powers under the Orderly Liquidation Authority[3], which allow them to multilaterally net to reduce contagion risks even if there is no such master agreement that a priori would have let them do so[5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDA_Master_Agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDA_Master_Agreement</a><p>[2] A Dialogue on the Costs and Benefits of Automatic Stays for Derivatives and Repurchase Agreements, by Duffie and Skeel, alternatively see [3], or [4]<p>[3]The New Financial Deal: Understanding the Dodd-Frank Act and Its (Unintended) Consequences by David Skeel.<p>[4] The Risk Controllers by Peter Norman.<p>[5] Even pre Dodd-Frank, when there wasn&#x27;t a law that let this happen, usually the creditors come together and fix things, a la LTCM &quot;bailout&quot;[6], which was funded entirely by the creditors and unwound in an orderly fashion through multilateral netting. Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were the only creditors that stiffed everyone else, by refusing to participate, and that was partly why they got fucked in 2009 since the other bankers remembered their unwillingness to help out in 1998, and reciprocated.<p>[6] I hate that this is called a Bailout. No taxpayer funds were spent. The creditors (i.e. big banks) bailed out one of their own by pooling together money and fixing their shit. The only governmental involvement was that the Fed president called the CEOs of the big banks and said &quot;yo fix your shit before it spreads&quot;, and they did. That&#x27;s not a bailout in the sense of &quot;taxpayers bailed them out&quot;. They bailed themselves out.",1432751507

The entire financial sector including things like pensions, insurance and corporate banking is only somewhere between 6-10% of the Swiss GDP, depending on how you precisely account for the risk premium. The construction industry alone is about 6% of the GDP. Switzerland does a <i>lot</i> of things beyond finance.<p>Also, though Switzerland has a big financial sector it&#x27;s not massively larger than other countries. If you use the &quot;output method&quot; then 10% of the Swiss GDP is finance. The next biggest is Ireland with 7%. So that&#x27;s a 3% difference, yet I don&#x27;t see anyone claiming that Ireland would be hosed without finance.<p>If you actually spend any time in Switzerland you&#x27;ll rapidly figure out why it does well - things are just remarkably well run there, and Swiss people are rather industrious and skilled. Their government stays out of expensive foreign wars and other boondoggles. Unemployment is extremely low.

9613355,comment,9611185,9613114,0,0,bunderbunder,,,"> Oversupply is part of it, but there&#x27;s also the issue of Universities offering fewer and fewer full-time tenure track positions.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the latter is a result of the former.  The oversupply, enables universities to confidently eliminate tenure track positions and replace them with tenure track positions. The jobs will be filled despite being less attractive because there are just. so. many. newly minted PhDs all fighting over the same scraps.<p>The only limiting factor is that you do need to have a few tenured professors to get your name out there by publishing high profile papers.  But there is only so much room in the high profile journals, so you really don&#x27;t need that many of them.  A sprinkle of graduates from one of the 2 or 3 top-ranked schools in their field will suffice.<p>To that end, I think the deeper problem is twofold:  First, in order to support their own careers professors need graduate students.  Many times as many graduate students as there are open positions that the professor will create by retiring.  Second, schools aren&#x27;t being honest with their students about this fact, and non-top-ranked schools in particular aren&#x27;t being forthright about admitting, &quot;We probably wouldn&#x27;t hire one of our own graduates for a full time position, not when we can easily snap up one of the surplus doctors that Yale keeps churning out.&quot;",1432751192

That all of her time has been teaching, so she might as well keep teaching. I&#x27;m also assuming you&#x27;ve never met someone who is <i>actually</i> passionate about their work. Is willing to work at 70% salary because funding is tight, or will take a pay cut to do something they love versus something they have little emotional investment in.<p>>> 2) What else are you going to do when all your training is academic?<p>I&#x27;m assuming here that you&#x27;ve never talked to anyone concerning their experience in getting a PhD. While many go on to academia, very little do it specifically to teach, many enjoy the prestige, pure research communities, and subject matter they study.",1432749689

I own devices from a manufacturer that supposedly uses close to vanilla Android to roll out quick updates. My Moto X 2013 is still rocking 4.4.4, despite the fact that it was just over a year old when Lollipop came out.<p>My Moto X 2014 (also pure) has Lollipop, but the bugfix releases (5.0.1 and 5.0.2) were never rolled out. The rumor is that 5.1 is now rolling out in Brazil (I am in the EU) and one US carrier. It&#x27;s been 2.5 months since 5.1 was released.<p>No surprise that my next phone will either be a Nexus or an iPhone (I used an iPhone 3G and then 4 for years, and always had prompt updates).<p>The counterargument is always: the user does not care about updates. But I assume that people who drop 500 Euro on a smartphone care more than those who buy low-end.",1432749605

Now, not only do I have no idea what &quot;IP&quot; is, other than some vague &quot;information&quot; (bits and bytes? phrases on paper? verbal instructions? URLs? methods of production?), I have no idea how to tell if some particular piece of information is &quot;stolen&quot; or &quot;not stolen&quot;.  I have to go ask someone (who?) to check.<p>My basic contention is that considering ideas or concepts or math as property, warps society beyond what most of us would like, and therefore, we should do away with the concept of &quot;IP&quot;. We&#x27;ll have to figure out something other than an &quot;IP regime&quot; to create appropriate incentives, but the possible disincentives from just about any &quot;IP regime&quot; are too bad to actually implement those &quot;IP regimes&quot;.",1432749604

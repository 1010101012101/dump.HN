Understanding how the qualities of a region affect the prosperity of its companies will aide you greatly when weighing the costs and benefits of moving for your startup and where to move to.<p>Prior to what I have learned through HN, I may have moved back to Europe without giving it a second thought. Pull your head out of the compiler for a minute to see how location will affect your hacking career.<p>Reddit content is funny pictures, useless politics, inflammatory youtube, and misleading headlines. This is none of those.",1203515970

Especially enjoyable is the stuff about his work on Quake - which, IMHO, was one of the greatest technical achievements in software, ever. (Do you think <i>you</i> could render a 3D environment at 25 fps, all in software, on a Pentium 75?? Unbelievable...)",1203515705

119658,comment,119504,119504,0,0,edw519,,,"Great concept, but I went once and it didn't work for me.  15 people squeezed into a 2 room apartment with no air conditioning.  I was the only one who didn't bring a laptop.  If I had, I would have had to balance it on my lap.  The people seemed nice enough, but every one of them had their head down, working away furiously.  I hated to interrupt anyone to chat.<p>Better for me would be working from home alone and going out to a bar or restaurant to socialize.  Oh wait, I already do that.<p>Interesting to find out if anyone here has had any good experiences with Jelly.",1203515458

119649,comment,119498,119498,0,0,mercurio,,,"Nice idea. Made me think of tinyurl, so thats good. But this is just as easy to replicate, which makes me think of the hundreds of tinyurl clones. If you take a look at how those clones tried to distinguish themselves from tinyurl and what features they added, it might give you some ideas on how to add value to your site. Might let you stay ahead of the inevitable competition if people find this useful.<p>Also, a pro user would want to integrate this into some other service. So you should consider providing a simple request API call that returns the feed address. You should also consider not charging any money initially and focus instead on building a userbase.",1203514935

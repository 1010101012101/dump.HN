2928848,comment,2928611,2928611,30,0,Mystalic,,,"Actually, this is pretty much in line with the advice I give to entrepreneurs when they're pitching me for a story on Mashable.<p>The big things to remember:<p>- We get hundreds of emails per day. I can barely keep up, so I need to use personal filters to weed out stories I'm going to follow up on. That means I trash long emails, emails that don't get to the point, and anything with buzzwords.<p>- Best thing is always an intro from somebody I know about the company/product. Cold pitches have a much lower chance of working.<p>- Short, pithy emails. Get to the point in less than a paragraph and then ask if I want to learn more.<p>- Know the audience. Mashable is a consumer-centric publication -- we don't cover a lot of enterprise news or startups. Our readers DEVOUR great consumer products that help them manage their digital lives though.<p>- Know the reporter. Mashable has two reporters that focus on startups. Most of my time is spent editing, which means I have less time than I'd like to write about startups. Some reporters focus on entertainment, others on mobile. Know which one focuses on what and try to get the appropriate person to pitch.<p>- Don't pitch via Facebook, Twitter or anything but email or in-person if you're at an event and find me. Even then though, I'll ask you to email me in case I want to forward it to another reporter.<p>~ Ben",1314374110

2928844,comment,2927821,2928155,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"The general issues I've had:<p>Flash is installed outside the package management system (particularly on distros emphasizing Free Software: Debian, Ubuntu, etc.). This has improved through packaged installers (the plug-in's still fetched from outside of repos), but only in very recent times.<p>Flash content fails to load at all.  I actually have this problem on several platforms, presumably because I limit JavaScript execution, and many sites now rely on third-party scripts for content generation (hello, Gawker, yes, you).<p>The player is very resource-heavy. I'll browse with several score tabs open.  On a sufficiently beefy box, that's tenable, but with flash, memory and CPU utilization go through the roof.<p>The browser plug-in crashes, frequently requiring a browser restart to restore it.  Given that Flash is virtually always at best ancillary to my browsing session (where I use it it's almost exclusively as a video player), my preference would be to have an external video player (I have several excellent free ones at my disposal).  The crashes are addressed in Chrome as tabs and plug-ins run as separate threads/processes, but this still affects Firefox/Iceweasel.<p>There are numerous security and privacy issues with Flash, for which we're wholly dependent on Adobe to please, eventually, maybe address these.<p>64 bit Linux support was a long, long, long time in coming (and IIRC it's still weak).  Until Linux itself got 32/64 bit library support sorted (again, only in recent years), this was a significant PITA.<p>Given Nielsen's criticisms (which address Flash as a website UI element, <i>not</i> such things as Flash video and games), yes, Flash is at <i>least</i> 99% bad. Most use is still advertising (yuk) and idiotic slideshows (infuriating).  Its valid uses (videos, maybe games) would still be better addressed through standalone utilities rather than in-browser plug-ins, IMO. I use my browser for work and information, not entertainment. I keep a lot of state in my browser sessions, and they tend to live for days if not weeks.<p>All in all, as a Linux user, up until 2008/2009, Flash was sufficiently a pain in the ass that I'd generally just not bother installing it.  I install it now (it's gotten easy enough) but block the hell out of it, with my rare use-case being YouTube videos and the very occasional informational graphic which makes valid use of Flash.",1314374018

2928841,comment,2928285,2928576,2,0,justinsb,,,"I'd like to know more about this.  My understanding is that every method in Clojure has this sort of signature:  Object F(Object, Object,.. Object)<p>So Add looks like this: Object Add(Object, Object)<p>Now if Clojure recognizes that this is often called with longs, then it would make sense to produce what is C++ would be a template specialization:  long Add(long, long).  As you pointed out, that could then be inlined.<p>As long as we can specialize all the way up the call chain, we don't need any JVM magic.  But that would be a lucky case, and I believe invokedynamic can help with our problem case: an argument-dependent transition from non-specialized code to specialized code.  i.e., call Add(long, long) iff both args are Longs, otherwise call Add(Object, Object).<p>So, Clojure would profit from invokedynamic if it (transparently) introduced specialized methods for optimization.  Of course, this is not exactly a trivial optimization to implement - it may be that the most practical way to implement it is to look at the runtime behaviour (sort of like what the JIT compiler does).  Ideally the JVM would be able to do all this magic specialization for us (given the parallels to JIT compilation), but I doubt that it can do that at present.<p>Anyone know if I'm off the mark here, or whether Clojure would benefit if it did what I've termed ""specialization""?",1314373951

Because it's obvious that many necessary type hints would be absent in a big real-world program.",1314373921

Anybody else find the premise to that statement a bit short-sighted?

Hell, he probably didn't even notice I was running Ubuntu.<p>Another time, I met a guy in a bar. He started serving me drinks as he noticed I was attracting pretty girls around the table. He told me that he owned multiple consumer electronics stores in China. A few days later, he was calling me to discuss the possibility of me opening up and managing a new store for him in Hong Kong.<p>I like to think that ""knowing I was handsome"" gave me a lot of confidence which is what really helped me out.

2928697,comment,2928195,2928554,12,0,alextp,,,"Indeed. Living in a third-world country makes it really obvious that while beauty is rooted in nature it can very easily be bought if you have enough money. As you age, the niceness your skin is inversely correlated to solar exposure and manual labor, and positively correlated with money spent in moisturizers and other products. How fit your body is also depends on the money/time spent on a gym and on the quality of the food you eat. Your hair will also look as nice as the money you spend on it (even if you're bald), and even teeth can be fixed if you have enough money at a young age. Finally, beauty is socially defined, and over time the standards will shift to mirror other aspects of society (in Brazil, for example, white people are generally better off, so all standards of beauty encourage ""looking white"", by hair straightening, makeup, etc. In places where rich people don't do manual work and stay indoors all day being pale is considered pretty, while in places where rich people can afford to go to the beach looking tan is considered better).",1314371257

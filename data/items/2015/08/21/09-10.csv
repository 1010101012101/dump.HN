In the case of the Weierstrass function, this removes any weirdness. This is because, for any accuracy, you could approximate the Weierstrass function as a polynomial. Note that the polynomial example is only to show that the weirdness of the Weierstrass function is not relevant in this context. Approximating it as a polynomial is not necessarily a good approach to approximating it as a neural network.",1440149811

If you’re using some 3rd party library that uses its own error codes, it’s usually trivial to pack them in HRESULT when failed, check HRESULT facility when formatting.<p>In C++, exceptions have fatal disadvantage: they don’t work across modules.

Instead of the 100k+ of jQuery & plugins I can often find one library that&#x27;s 4k and another that&#x27;s 6k that together do all I need. If you need <i>most</i> of jQuery, ZeptoJS [2] is often a good answer.<p>That said, sometimes ecosystems are powerful. When you need nontrivial functionality, and the best options have a dependency on jQuery, it might still make sense to include jQuery. Development time still counts: Spending an extra 30 hours to reinvent a component is great if you&#x27;re spending your own time on it, but when you&#x27;re billing by the hour, it&#x27;s a lot harder to justify if that component is available off the shelf and Just Works in about 5 minutes.<p>It&#x27;s all about compromises. I do think that it&#x27;s common to see developers throw in a component if it&#x27;s even slightly useful, leading to the web of today where a single page might download and initialize 40-60 different libraries. It would be healthy if the pendulum would swing back in the other direction.

It&#x27;s nonsense to suppose that a dictionary is anything but alphabetized preposterous oversimplifications.

They expect a shell (CLI shell, GUI shell, or whatever), for example, which by those academic definitions is clearly an application and not part of the OS.

Not only as an artform but as a practical measure.<p>For any small piece of code a compiler can produce a comparable result to hand written assembly. Entire programs that have been written in assembly tend to be much smaller, use less memory and run faster.  That apparent contradiction is where the focus of crafted code should be.  Most of the gains from hand crafted assembly do not come from finding the quickest way to do a simple calculation, but the additional attention that gets applied.   It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if the majority of the gain comes from not instruction level optimisation, but calculation level optimisation.<p>For example,  how do you find the last word in a string?  Have a look on stackOverflow and you will see examples in many language that are the equivalent to.<p><pre><code>    var lastword = fullString.split(&quot; &quot;).pop();\n</code></pre>\nThe work done by this operation is easier and easier to overlook as things get higher level.<p>I have often wondered on the merits of writing a virtual assembly instruction set that is platform agnostic (so compiles/transliterates to native) to explore this idea.  It wouldn&#x27;t be like JVM bytecode which implements higher level magic, and it wouldn&#x27;t be like LLVM which is not aimed at being human writable.  Some existing RISC instruction sets might be close to what is needed.  There would be potential to write things in multiple instruction sets,  If the interfaces between code sections are well defined (stack/register/memory passing)  you could write modular code in a preferred Instruction set.<p>This isn&#x27;t practical for many applications,  but I&#x27;m not convinced that doesn&#x27;t have a possible niche.",1440147601

If this movie was going to be a dud, Sony would make some money back, greater than zero revenue. All their costs are sunk.<p>But the theaters would lose money relative to how much they might make screening a more popular movie. So the theater chains can use this as an excuse to cancel showing the release, which is probably a violation of some contract or agreement, but they can get away with it in this special circumstance.",1418896773

The Al Arabiya feature photo clearly states it&#x27;s an AFP file photo.  There are no references to a tweet, and certainly no direct claims that it&#x27;s an actual photo of the executed man, or that it&#x27;s their &quot;source&quot; for claims that ISIS crucified someone.  Maybe they are giving too strong of false implications about the photo, but I don&#x27;t follow your jump to &quot;made up out of thin air&quot; just because a file photo was used for illustration.  I could agree the story sounds shaky, but not based on the evidence you gave here.",1418896694

It&#x27;s an extremely interesting project that tries to implement secure and anonymous communications with completely different objectives than Tor and other P2P networks like I2P.<p>The fact that the network itself also contains all its content in an anonymous, distributed way it a very interesting approach since no one knows what encrypted fragment they hold and there are no central servers.<p>I remember that since each resource in a website could be scattered across many many nodes, any webpage that loaded external resources would take a very long time to load, and many of the resources would have disappeared after a while, especially when considering that a lot of people would not stay connected to the network continuously or allocate much storage for their node.<p>One solution would be to load all resources as part of a single page site that would contain HTML, CSS and base64 encoding of the images. It would take a long time to get all the blocks for a large page/site, but nothing would be lost.<p>Enabling Javascript is probably a bad idea when browsing Freenet, but using it would open a lot more possibilities (like using the newfangled BGP image[<i>] format to significantly reduce the payload).<p>[</i>]:<a href=""http://bellard.org/bpg/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bellard.org/bpg/</a>",1418894900

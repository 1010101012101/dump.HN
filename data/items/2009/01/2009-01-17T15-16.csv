There's currently no way to lock story titles, so the only way to avoid an endless cycle of reverts was to disable his account for a few hours.  I only replied to that comment because there was no other way of contacting him; he had no email addr in his profile.  I reinstated his account as soon as he emailed me.",1232207887

438164,comment,437321,437321,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"<i>Yet, only a small fraction of streets have dedicated bike lanes, and with an installation cost of $5,000 to $50,000 per mile, we shouldn’t expect to find them everywhere anytime soon.</i><p>Why are they so expensive? Adding a bike lane consists of painting a stripe down the side of the road and adding a little icon of a cyclist. The latter could just be painted with a stencil. Keeping the line parallel to the others means a road maintenance truck would probably do it, but is there really <i>that</i> much bureaucratic overhead? That's $1-10 per foot of bike lane.<p>I saw a system that attached a paint roller to the back wheel for a ""DIY bike lane"", for something that uses paint rather than lasers. (I can't find the link.) I still don't think it's a good idea, but paint of any kind is probably an improvement over lasers.<p>Is adding bike lanes even approaching the problem from the right angle, though? They arguably help prevent a driver from hitting you from behind, but they don't improve misunderstandings about intent/right-of-way at intersections, which is where more collisions actually occur.",1232207657

HN is not supposed to be just about hacking, but about anything interesting to hackers-- anything interesting to the intellectually curious.  There is not necessarily zero overlap between that and Reddit.  E.g. Reddit users probably started posting earlier about the present recession, but when the matter became serious enough we started to have some stories about it here too.<p>As for the claim that this should be killed because it's a crap link, it definitely seems over the threshold for that. It's not just a bunch of random, biased bystanders who are making this accusation, but the UN (<a href=""http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/01/yesterday-david.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.wired.com/defense/2009/01/yesterday-david.html</a>).

438150,comment,437275,437664,0,0,martin,,,"Totally agree on the ease of use thing. I used to do some MIDI composition with an old version of Cakewalk Home Studio years ago. It was light on notational features (that's not really what it was intended for) but I've never come upon another app that I found to be as straightforward to sit down with and just bang out some musical ideas. This web app could easily become a perfect solution for that sort of informal usage. But the UI needs to be stupid easy, and currently it's not. It seems like you should be able to import a MIDI to get started, too.<p>I think score sharing done right (i.e. better than this) would be pretty awesome, too. Open it up to non-members and add search, tagging, ratings, commenting, etc., and you'd have the YouTube of musical compositions and arrangements. There's a BIG community of musicians out there for whom that could prove very valuable.",1232206686

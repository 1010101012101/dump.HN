I worked for a company similar in this aspect.<p>Employee got given tight high pressure deadline. When he made it, he was rewarded by another tight high pressure project.

It depends on the current state of the network (the miners mempools), the priority of your transaction, the fee/bytes of your transaction, and what % of the hashing power bitundo has. Some transactions take a few blocks to get confirmed, these are the ones that have a much, much higher likelyhood of being undone.",1397599178

Accomplishing something doesn&#x27;t always take long itself, but it can require spending a day of reading wikis and documentation to accomplish something simple when you&#x27;ve got a lot of moving parts.

Yes you can find that information on other sites, but why give it away for free if people are already willing to pay for it?<p>Netflix could use the money saved from a project like this to get more and more shows/movies on their network. A bigger library of content is what will make them have more and more growth, not awareness via SEO. Awareness is something I think they already have that down pretty well.<p>However, I think this could come into play and be a more helpful strategy when more and more competition comes around (other than just Hulu and Amazon) against Netflix.

7594383,comment,7593909,7594050,12,0,userbinator,,,"Unless some radical change happens to laptop power supplies in the next few months - a change from designs that have remained the same for over a decade - it&#x27;s very likely this adapter will work with the newest (normal) laptops available when it comes out.<p>Also, laptops have very flexible power input circuits that will accept a wide range of DC input: they&#x27;ll start running from ~12V (the voltage of an almost-dead battery), and go as high as the voltage specs on the input components allows - 25V (filter caps) is the usual absolute upper limit. Higher voltage means lower I^2R losses but manufacturers like to leave some safety margin, which is why 20V is somewhat of a de-facto standard given the parts available. The general power distribution circuits in a laptop are like this: there&#x27;s a main power rail, whose voltage varies with battery voltage when running on battery, and is the DC-IN voltage with the adapter plugged in. The voltages for the CPU, GPU, chipset, etc. are all generated by DC-DC converters supplied from this main rail. There&#x27;s a set of diodes/MOSFETs that wire-OR together the battery and DC-IN to the main rail, preventing current flow in the wrong direction. It also powers the battery charger.<p>I&#x27;ve read a lot of laptop schematics, and all of them use very similar power circuitry, often with the same components. The only real concern with device compatibility is in the ID schemes that some manufacturers use, either to &quot;lock out&quot; third party adapters or encode wattage selection. The simplest ones are nothing more than a resistor in the plug, different values for different wattages (IBM/Lenovo is one example). More complex ones use a 1-wire interface to an EEPROM or other storage element (Dell, Apple) (<a href=""http://www.laptop-junction.com/toast/content/dell-ac-power-adapter-id-chip-died"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.laptop-junction.com/toast/content/dell-ac-power-a...</a> <a href=""http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-magsafe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.righto.com/2013/06/teardown-and-exploration-of-ma...</a> ). Then there&#x27;s all the others that have no ID at all, just +/- input, and these are the most compatible.<p>About the Dart itself: the technology used here (VHF SMPS) has been around for a long time in military/aerospace applications, where size/weight is more important than reducing switching losses.<p><a href=""http://www.eevblog.com/forum/crowd-funded-projects/vhf-laptop-power-supply/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eevblog.com/forum/crowd-funded-projects/vhf-lapto...</a>",1397596851

Affirmative action is great, but this is absolutely ridiculous.</i><p>To clarify, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with having a strong policy  to counter-act &quot;normal&quot; discrimination. What is wrong is explicitly discriminating against a group of people, regardless of who they are.<p>This reminds me of some radical feminist fractions who say most books are not worth reading because they are written by dead, white, males [no citation]. It&#x27;s absolutely true that white males are unfairly dominating the classics section, but the way to combat this is not to blacklist them. That&#x27;s a recipe for disaster, and I&#x27;m quite certain Simone de Beauvoir would agree with me.<p>EDIT: Since this will be part of the discussion, it&#x27;s important to understand what affirmative action is. Here&#x27;s the definition from Wikipedia: <i>policy of providing special opportunities for, and favoring members of, a disadvantaged group who suffer from discrimination</i>.<p>It&#x27;s about positive discrimination of disadvantaged groups, not elimination of advantaged groups.<p>EDIT 2: This topic has been flagged already, but I&#x27;m writing this for future reference. What this seems to imply is that if a new Greenwald or Snowden comes along, they are <i>explicitly not welcome</i>. This is not affirmative action at all, it&#x27;s just an unreflected usage of it, without understanding the true \nmeaning or function of affirmative action.<p>An organization with such an attitude will eventually die. I hope this was just a poorly worded reply from an individual that doesn&#x27;t reflect how firstlook actually deals with these things.",1397596100

The initial work will mostly be done via central planning and government regulation.<p>It&#x27;s even possible, like the VW scandal has reverberations in consumer confidence in their brand, that global warming has the potential to discredit capitalism in the eyes of the public, if a carbon tax doesn&#x27;t get introduced soon enough to see capitalism as part of the solution and not just the problem.",1444809569

That&#x27;s a way-out-in-the-future concept, not any kind of concern for the physical body of the immoral person.<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say there aren&#x27;t practical benefits to Biblical sexuality.  Certainly your chance of getting an STI is dramatically reduced (eliminated?) by remaining faithful to your spouse in marriage.  Abstinence for the unmarried has the same obvious benefits.  Heterosexuality is clearly the easiest way to procreate, and the inherent differences between men and women gives children a broader experience of physical, mental, emotional interaction with the world (seeing how mom and dad handle the same situation in gender-unique ways, for instance).<p>But again, all of that is the secondary concern.  The primary concern of all sin is the immediate effect it has on the spiritual condition of a man.  The preeminent theme throughout the Old Testament and New is that God is Holy.  He takes his holiness seriously.  Man has sinned.  God judges all sins.  There is one way back to God, and that&#x27;s by taking advantage of the path He made back to Himself, via his son, Jesus.",1444809460

10385414,comment,10382369,10384978,0,0,jcranmer,,,"Requiring a reference implementation with a standard is a bad idea. First off, who&#x27;s going to write it? The compiler vendors are the people who&#x27;d likely do the best job, and they already have to adapt their implementations for changes--now you&#x27;re making them do it twice. Another, even bigger issue, is that it actually doesn&#x27;t tell you what&#x27;s hard to implement. MSVC, gcc, and clang all take different approaches to their compiler, and what can be easy to implement in one could turn out to be ridiculously difficult in another (e.g., exposing a full AST via reflective mechanisms). You need a diversity of implementations, not just one implementation, to know what&#x27;s actually hard to implement and what&#x27;s not.<p>It&#x27;s interesting that you bring up export templates, because that fiasco feature actually already sort of had a reference implementation. The original Cfront compiler actually supported it (admittedly, it was very buggy). The problem with export was that, at the time of discussion (~1996), no one really understood just what the impact of all of the template complexity meant--they assumed that templates were basically just a typesafe variant of the C preprocessor (or at least that most common use could be boiled down to that description; its Turing-completeness was known by then).<p>So, in that vein, export template was seen as a &quot;well, this is going to be tricky, but so is name resolution in general in C++&quot; and the overarching use case was compelling (you can hide the implementation of a regular function, why not templates?). Compiler vendors objected to the feature, but not on the basis that it was essentially impossible to implement, but rather that major design points would need quibbles. It was eventually accepted into the standard largely with the understanding that everyone would implement something close to it, if not the exact current specification.<p>The only thing that would have prevented export template from being standardized would have been requiring a fairly robust implementation that could have discovered that export template really did infect every part of the code base in a horrible way, and it should be noted that reference implementations generally aren&#x27;t that robust. Amaya, after all, didn&#x27;t prevent HTML 4 or CSS 2 from having unimplementable sections.",1444808422

It is a misconception of Jesus&#x27; teachings to say that he invalidated the Mosaic law with a message of &quot;it&#x27;s all about love&quot;.

How much difference is there in reality between the Victorian drive to civilize and Christianize, and the modern Western impulse to ram &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;freedom&quot; down the throats of unwilling societies at the point of a gun? If anything, they were a lot less hypocritical than we are.",1444806294

If they had planned on offering you more, the worst case scenario is that you will get offered your ideal figure. If they had planned on offering you less, the worst case scenario is that they will try and negotiate you down.

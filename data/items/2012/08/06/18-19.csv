There are many widely-supported encryption standards that are incredibly hard to break, hard enough that no one will reasonably try. However if you leave it wide open, you're not only allowing your access to be used by everyone for everything, you're also allowing them free access to every device on your network.<p>If you're in a densely populated area, someone could spend the time to break your encryption from their own home. But if they're doing that, they're going to be doing worse once you let them in. Open wifi will only compound your issues. If you're not within range of your neighbors, you'll probably notice someone sitting outside for long enough (weeks/months/years) to break your encryption. Long enough to call the police.<p>Basically, if you're worried about a possible legal case involving the use of your network and your defense strategy is to open your network, you might be in much more immediate trouble by allowing people in. You'd still be on the hook for the activities on your network, but now your bank account has been drained by the guys who did nothing more than drive by your house with a laptop so now you don't have the money for a legal defense.",1344279469

Existing P2P and cryptoware hides stuff for all but the participating parties, but creating those groups of participation has, thusfar, always been the domain of centralized easy-to-take down services.<p>The mold you set, of speaking of this oncoming future, waving your hand about ""next gen,"" is a massive dis-service and harmful uninformed PR against the work that needs to be done. The change you <i>hope</i> is in the wind isn't going to be a part of the technical evolution and flow of progress, it's a deliberate technological revolution, making the fickle changing mesh of us all self assemble in a behaved fashion to permit us to shoot content queries to everyone on the planet in search of a copy of XYZ audiobook, and find the two people who have it. That requires huge amounts of caching of the libraries available content out there (so we don't actually have to go ask <i>everyone</i>), or what Tribler calls their megacaches, which at this stage are far more local than global.<p>So we have steps. BuddyCast3, the social overlay that underpins much of Tribler, gets some of the way there, but it's far far from a global search, and most of it's content is populated by existing trackers. Magnets, DHT, PEX, these were all invaluable core decentralization tools, but finding what it is you want, searching through whatever content is out there, is a huge problem which, unlike better lithography technology, no one has a roadmap for achieving, and <i>saying otherwise builds a false sense of comfort that betrays the cause.</i>",1344279399

4346610,comment,4345841,4346218,12,0,uvdiv,,,"What's wrong with the economies of scale of larger nuclear plants? I'm asking curiously, I don't understand the fascination with home energy sources.<p>Radioactive decay is a small energy source compared to fission. Look at the binding energies [1]: the energy accessible by fissioning heavy elements is about 200 MeV -- 1 MeV per nucleon. Radioactive decays are two orders of magnitude less, or smaller.<p>Pu-238 is one of the nicest ones because it is ""clean"" -- emitting <i>only</i> alpha radiation, which is easy to shield. You can transmute on the order of 1 atom of it per 100 fission events [2]. A fission event is 200 MeV; a Pu-238 decay is 5.6 MeV. So at steady state, you can support less than 1/3,000th as much Pu-238 power as you can fission power. If you have a Pu-238 source, you also have a vastly larger nuclear fission power source, so why not just use that?<p>More broadly, it's not a likely idea on physics, even if you accept all radioisotopes (difficult-to-shield gamma emitters) and not just ""nice"" ones. The high-Z radioactive decay chains end quickly at the element lead [3], so only release a fraction of the energy that is accessible by fission. (Look back to the binding energy curve [1]). And many of these decays are unusably, geologically slow. The naturally-occurring radioisotopes have half lives of >10^8 years (otherwise they wouldn't exist anymore -- they were created in ancient history in supernovae). And trying to transmute them doesn't improve much -- i.e. in a fission reactor, the most common [4] high-Z product is Pu-239 (half life >10^4 years), whose next decay is to U-235 (half life >10^8 years). Others are similar. So I don't see any way forwards.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Binding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Binding_energy_curve_-_com...</a><p>[2] Through the several processes which create Np-237 from uranium -- a relatively rare process [4].

You might also want to include the Capitol Corridor and ACE lines, which have minuscule ridership (5300 and 3700 daily, respectively), but add considerable trackage (168 and 84 miles).  San Francisco's Muni Metro is a hair under 37 miles, but transports 162,000 riders daily.  There's also San Jose's LRT, but let's leave that out for now.<p>A comparable rail map for the San Francisco Bay Area: <a href=""http://www.urbanrail.net/am/snfr/sf-bay-area-map.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.urbanrail.net/am/snfr/sf-bay-area-map.htm</a><p>That puts the Bay Area commuter rail at 472 track miles and 598,000 passengers daily.  Rather closer to your Chicago numbers.<p>But we've got to add in Chicago's CTA 'L line (709,000 daily riders, 108 miles).  Tips lead to Chicago again.<p>Chicago benefits greatly from having grown up around (and not torn down much of its) commuter rail lines, including significant urban and suburban growth from 1860 - 1910, pre-automobile.  It's occasionally noted in both areas that commute times a century ago were comparable to, or faster than, today (dedicated rights of way, less traffic, arguably fewer safety restrictions).  The Bay Area notably tore down its old Key System commute rail, and several counties (San Mateo, Marin) have fought BART extensions for a half century, and saw much of its growth in the car-friendly post-WWII era.<p>The Bay Area's layout is actually fairly rail-friendly, with a few major transportation corridors (Peninsula, East Bayshore, CA-24, I-580, I-80, US 101 north of SF), though overall densities are low.  Chicago has experienced a great deal of sprawl in the past 30 years, as well as employer flight to the suburbs, greatly increasing suburb-to-suburb commuting, though both SF and Chicago have also seen an increased appeal of the inner urban core especially for younger professionals.",1344278410

4346440,comment,4345463,4345993,7,0,tikhonj,,,"This argument always comes up and it never makes any sense.<p>The GNU is exactly the <i>opposite</i> of normal copyright. The fact that it is based on copyright law is just an implementation detail because the FSF does not have enough clout to pass actual laws. It's a clever hack of the legal system, not an ideological reaffirmation of copyright.<p>The idea behind normal copyright--what some people here do not like--is to limit others' access to information. The whole point is that you cannot copy something without the right-owner's permission.<p>The GPL is the opposite. The core idea there is that you are not only allowed to make a copy of something, but you are also allowed to access the source code. In practical terms, this is just as important as being able to copy a program because the only meaningful way to make modifications is with access to the source code. Moreover, the license ensures that anybody using the licensed program keeps it free in the same way.<p>Essentially, where normal copyright keeps you from using the information, the GPL keeps you from using copyright law to keep others from using the information. In a very practical sense, something under the GPL is <i>more</i> free than something in the public domain--I could ship you something containing public domain code and not give you the source code or even let you modify it. I could not do that with the GPL.<p>Another way to look at it is that normal copyright gives rights to the ""rights-holder"" over the consumer. The GPL gives rights to the consumer (like access to source code) rather than to the rights-holder. The ""restrictions"" it places are the sort of restrictions any system based around rights has to have--you have the right to do almost anything as long as you do not infringe others' rights. In this context it means you can do anything you want (including <i>selling</i> the software) as long as you do not stop others from modifying and redistributing it.<p>In short: the GPL is the opposite of copyright and it gives the consumer <i>more</i> freedom. The only thing it stops you from doing is <i>taking away</i> others' freedom. The only reason it uses copyright is because copyright effectively allows you to write your own laws (but limited to whatever works you've copyrighted) without going through the legislature. In a perfect world, it would be unnecessary--all software would just be free as in freedom.",1344277604

Or to show Archimedes how to derive the volume of a sphere using calculus (should you show him how to generalize the formula for a n-dim sphere, maybe not).<p>So that brings us to the following thought: There are two kinds of advice a time traveler can give: (i) ""Objective"" stuff that <i>will</i> actually happen, and that perhaps you can provide proof for, i.e. the Instagram advice; and (ii) ""subjective"" stuff that may or may not turn out that way, i.e. ""don't marry that girl"".<p>BTW, due to the Butterfly Effect (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect</a>) these two are not as clear cut as above.",1344276056

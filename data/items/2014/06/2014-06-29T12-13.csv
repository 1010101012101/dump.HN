We can&#x27;t forget that their major implementations are built with C and/or C++, along with much of the underlying software they run upon or interact with.<p>I don&#x27;t dispute that languages like Java, C# and Go being widely used. And while the systems built with them may be critical within a very local scope, such as at the company level, pretty much all software of global importance is still implemented in C, C++, or some mix of the two. This is true almost 20 years after Java came on the scene, almost 15 years after C# did, and almost 5 years Go did.<p>Go is perhaps the only case where this may change, given how its implementors have expressed interest in porting their existing C code to Go. But that still won&#x27;t change the fact that the operating systems, databases, and other software systems that Go code often interacts with are still very likely to be implemented using C and/or C++.",1404046022

7960985,comment,7960832,7960832,4,0,Pacabel,,,"It&#x27;s pretty well known that C++ suffers from a variety of problems. Many of them have been known about for some time. Despite this, nobody has been able to produce a truly viable alternative.<p>There have been some encouraging developments, of course. But they&#x27;ve had their own drawbacks that are often worse, in practice, than the problems of C++.<p>D is an example of this. A lot of new and existing C++ code probably could be written in D instead. But D lacks the widespread adoption and support that C++ offers. This translates into there being fewer third party libraries available, which increases the burden on programmers to an extent that&#x27;s usually unjustifiable during commercial development And this, in turn, helps prevent the adoption of D.<p>Rust is another example. It theoretically sounds like it could be a replacement for C++, but that&#x27;s only true in the far future. The language and its standard libraries have yet to show any real signs of stability. We&#x27;ve been hearing that there may be a 1.0 release at the end of 2014, but time is quickly running out on this. Even then, it will merely be where D is at that point. While there may be a fair number of Rust libraries in existence at this point, many of them have become broken due to language or standard library changes, many are woefully incomplete, and many are totally abandoned.<p>Then there are Java, C#, Go and others which claim to be successors or potential replacements, and perhaps this is true in a very limited subset of cases. But the remaining situations where they aren&#x27;t suitable are large in number and quite critical.<p>Furthermore, we are continually seeing C++ adapt and evolve. It&#x27;s getting new features and functionality that these competitors are offering, while still usually giving far more freedom and control to programmers, far better performance, far better portability, far greater practicality, and continued use for serious new software projects. These factors combine to make it an even more difficult situation for potential C++ replacements. They just may not bring enough to the table to warrant replacing C++ for a majority of its users or potential users.",1404044468

Google drive development of the platform and then code dump their work every release. FOSS communities end up having to build around the edges of what Google have accomplished, and you get a general sense that the code only gets put out in the best interests of business with the likes of Samsung, not the little guy. Google aren&#x27;t even very good at giving straight answers to wider community concerns. Then there&#x27;s bitterness in the end because you&#x27;re always going to be dependent on charity from the device manufacturers in letting you unlock your device and provide proprietary driver BLOBs.<p>Also, the parts of Android that are open aren&#x27;t really the most interesting ones, but the most mediocre. Much of the guts of Android is merely adequate, technically unimpressive, and deliberately selected over better alternatives because using a truly FOSS base would risk commercial isolation. Android is a platform hobbled together well enough to get manufacturers to put it on their phones and ensure people are using Googles data services.<p>Bottom line: as long as its slightly better to work with than Apple, and slightly more open, it will win the hearts of developers.

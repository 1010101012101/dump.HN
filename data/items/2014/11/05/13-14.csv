My point is, yes, you can buy democrats and some republicans to vote in favor of more government spending. But you apparently can&#x27;t buy them all to do it.<p>During cold war you could try to buy Moscow communists as much as you wanted so they allowed you open bank branch in USSR, but this would never happen.<p>You can try buy guys like Ron Paul all day long in attempt to get bailout, but you won&#x27;t get it.<p>The problem is with the voter. If the feeling at the Capitol was that there will be severe punishment for the bailouts, our beloved Senators and Representatives would be too worried to loose their office to vote for that nonsense. Mind you they can sell their services to other industries too and make money in the process without the risk of loosing office (aka &quot;everything&quot;). The voter allowed them to do that. Because voter doesn&#x27;t understand that bankruptcy and crisis are important parts of economic cycle. And are needed! To remove excesses from the system. To relieve workers from BS jobs too! So you can start over after 1-2 years in healthy economy without zombie banks. We didn&#x27;t allow capitalism to work. Blaming capitalism for that doesn&#x27;t add up.<p>BTW, I respect socialism and socialist movement. I&#x27;m liberal on social issues as liberal you can get.

I did a hunt a little while ago for ways to read and write NTFS on Linux and Mac, and didn&#x27;t find many options (commercial or open).   The most common response (beyond &quot;reformat!&quot;) was to just mount the filesystem in a windows box (or windows running in a VM) and share it over a network connect, which abstracts away the file system, though adds overhead.<p>(BTW: For mac, I found Tuxera and Paragon, and the &quot;built in&quot; non-supported approach to writing NTFS.  For linux, NTFS-3G (with proper fuse support) was the go to, but I found corruption under load in my minimal tests, which probably reflect my setup and lack of experience more than problems with the software)<p>Have you guys found preferred ways to R/W mount an NTFS volume or partition or USB drive without having to do a network mount for Linux or MacOS?  Could this work in ReactOS become the seed?  Or is considered a solved problem?",1415195405

If it went bankrupt -- as it should have -- I would be working productively somewhere else. Unless &quot;somewhere&quot; else is also supported by the tax payer money and artificially cheap credit, FED rates at 0% full economic cycle now.\nThe solution is more capitalism, not socialism. I.e. let them go bankrupt! This is what capitalism is all about. You take risks. You win, big payout! You loose, you go bankrupt! This is capitalism, not tax funded corporations. That&#x27;s socialism for the rich. But don&#x27;t call that capitalism, please! Interest rates at 0% for 7 years?! Set by whom? Capitalist free markets?

And potentially ruin a solid test.<p>What I find you want is a very threaded model. I normally just throw threads at the scheduler and let it sort out the details.<p>Typically you want IO/error handling done in its own heavy thread for each from of IO. Or each source, Ethernet, DAQ card, etc. Luckily ethernet does most of this for you.<p>Next your post-error processed IO should get sorted into something, normally a structure of some sort, and dumped into a generally read only structure.<p>This structure is read by 2 threads. 1 logs it, 1 processes it further (before moving to another thread to be logged).<p>This lets your processing be largely independent and have no IO slow down. Which is handy when your approaching ~20GB/hr+ of data streaming. Most of what you get, and generate internally doesn&#x27;t have to be logged, unless you <i>really</i> like buying hard drives.<p>Also by keeping these separate you can have multiple <i>processing</i> threads. But when you do be on guard. Haveing 1 IO -> N processing -> 1 IO will result in data arriving at the 2 be logged IO not in the order it was recieved.<p>You will likely want a catch all thread sitting between logging and IO to sort the last ~500 items by time stamp, so they can be logged properly.<p>TL;DR<p>1) Make sure you keep track of when it arrived log it in the same order<p>2) More threads are better then none.<p>3) Make sure communication errors don&#x27;t occur (if your using TCP the OS does this for you).",1415194827

How is it that that reflects some sort of keep-the-masses-down 1% malfeasance?<p>The way I understand it, these pointless &#x27;arms-race&#x27; jobs are jobs tend to also produce little to no value to society.  They may produce value for their bosses in the form of making the boss look good to the uber-bosses, or they may provide value to their company as a means of maintaining competitive advantage in the market place.<p>These is less a direct function of the skills of the workers than a function of the roles in which those workers are placed.

And if you propose that they also could work less, therefore we would have more doctor positions to be filled, guess what, people that have valuable jobs are also the ones who really like their job, and are happy with working 40 hours, or even more. It&#x27;s somehow ironic that people won&#x27;t do work, just because they like what they do, they also want to be acknowledged monetary, no matter how much they like their job, which I can understand. Somehow we have a situation, i.e. from a doctor&#x27;s perspective, like: &quot;Yea, I&#x27;ll treat you, but only if you are also getting up at seven every morning and commute to some office and do stuff.&quot;<p>2) I think for biological reasons, people need status more than spare-time. We need some kind of hierarchy to determine who is more entitled to spread their genes. If everybody is unemployed, how do you know who has more status?

8561567,comment,8561075,8561075,0,0,oddtarball,,,"Technical analysis is far from useless.  As an active trader, it&#x27;s the best tool I have come across.  I&#x27;m sorry, but to say that it is useless is to admit pure ignorance, or to admit your failure to grasp the concepts and understand how to apply them visually and correctly.<p>People do apply techniques incorrectly, yes.  They can get confirmation bias from it, yes.  However, that does not invalidate successful traders who trade primarily on technicals.  Keep in mind that a &quot;tool&quot; is just that - but not used the same way by everyone - and &quot;this means that&quot; isn&#x27;t a blanket rule that always works as described.  Everything is part of a larger structural puzzle.  Also, HFT algos will eat your lunch if your hold period is too short.  I don&#x27;t hold a position for more than a week, MAYBE two, but never less than 45 minutes - and as a retail trader, that makes a huge difference in P/L ratios over time.<p>Through my trading experience I have continuously used less fundamentals and more wonky technical techniques I have come up with.  It has given me a massive edge over whoever is on the other side of the trade, and has pulled me quite a long way out of debt and into making a nice living doing it on the side.  The side of the story that you don&#x27;t see in the endless &quot;get rich quick&quot; trading schemes that promise to teach you all of those super awesome secrets is that anyone who knows what they&#x27;re doing isn&#x27;t spending any time teaching it to the masses.<p>But, to get back on topic:  Well done with this site!  It&#x27;s a great beginner guide to understand what a lot of the basics actually mean.  Babypips falls very short.",1415192657

8561565,comment,8561080,8561428,0,0,rondon2,,,"His point is that there is no way to provide statistics on the number of bullshit jobs.<p>For example, I worked at a company where we made networking software for some military radios. We had a &quot;Hardware Engineer&quot; that fixed or returned radios that had stopped working. From all economist metrics this was not a bullshit job. He was using his engineering degree to do engineering work.<p>But in reality he added nothing to the productivity of the company.  He actually reduced the productivity of the company by taking 3 days to do 5 minutes of work. I stopped using him and did it myself when he was at lunch.  It is impossible to get metrics on bullshit level because it includes lots of nuances.  For example, i&#x27;m sure this guy and his manager would say that only he was capable of doing the hardware work because he took a 1 hour course on electrostatic discharge.<p>It would take a lot of evidence gathering for me to prove that this was a bullshit job and once I did prove it his manager would have immediately assigned him some new responsibilities making my previous data worthless.  This is a big problem with macro-economics.  Economic Job data is limited to Salary,Title,Hour worked.    It doesn&#x27;t tell you much more than that.",1415192566

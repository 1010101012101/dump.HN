Because over the year or so I gave sitename-passwords a try it popped up as an issue way more than 3 times, even after I started ignoring subdomains and instituted rules about always trying to use the main domain for big companies. There are tons of systems out there that use cross-domain (notably both of my banks and both of my schools), hidden-domain (i.e. log into an app or device where the parent domain isn&#x27;t immediately obvious), or changing domains. Of course, these issues were nothing compared to trying to remember all of the variations I added to sate the enormous variety of conflicting password requirements (especially novelty requirements and passwords you don&#x27;t get to choose).<p>I was in complete denial about how bad the situation was until I encountered some light teasing from acquaintances who didn&#x27;t even know me that well -- just well enough to know I couldn&#x27;t ever remember my passwords. I started keeping tick marks on my calendar and found a ~75% success rate, although the 75% was composed of the handful of logins I used every day and the 25% was &quot;everything else&quot; so the reality was that the password derivation system was failing for a strong majority of passwords.<p>I gave up and started using lastpass. No regrets, but many positive surprises: that time their network was breached but it didn&#x27;t matter because they didn&#x27;t use shit encryption, the automated password reset feature for big-profile leaks (they give you a &quot;todo&quot; list which is often as simple as clicking a single button next to each item), the ability to easily store serial numbers, &quot;verification questions&quot;, and other nonsense, a general lack of guessing passwords several times before success, and an ability to dramatically up the cross-entropy of my passwords.<p>I might move from lastpass to a physical repository some time. But I am <i>never, ever</i> going back to a password derivation scheme.<p>I wish you luck. Or an eidetic memory. You&#x27;ll need it.",1441886207

Because a rail stop isn&#x27;t cheap to move and comes with the expectation of a certain level of service and traffic prioritization, the neighborhood grows around the rail line, not the opposite. A BRT line is more easily neglected.<p>There&#x27;s a positive feedback loop involved in any transit investment and how it affects the neighborhood, but especially so with rail - unquestionably so as you think at bigger scales. One of the touted benefits of California High Speed Rail, for example, is that it would bring the Central Valley cities into the commuting sphere of the other urban centers.<p>(The worst thing you could do with a rail stop, from a land-use perspective, is put a big surface parking lot around it. That turns it into a transfer point for a car commute, not a prestigious destination that other transit will naturally run toward. One of the problems with the CHSR plan, the last time I looked, is that the Central Valley alignments are a pretty dodgy package.)<p>That said, providing better transit at lower cost is always an upside, since the first-order question for trip planning by transit is always the overall level of service - frequency and coverage, as well as speed.

I&#x27;m serious.<p>Before I worked at Google, in 30 years of programming I never worked at a company that had a line limit. Adding a line limit at Google did not make me more productive. At first I thought &quot;hey, I guess 80 chars makes side by side comparison easier&quot; but then I thought back, hmm. I never had problems comparing code before when I didn&#x27;t have a line limit.<p>Instead what I found was that 80 character limit was a giant waste of time. The article just pointed out a year of wasted time. I can point to searching and replacing an identifier and then having to go manually reformat hundreds of lines of code all because of some arbitrary style guide. I also had code generators at google that had to generate code that followed the line limit. I too wasted days futsing with the generator to break the lines at the correct places all because of some arbitrary line limit.<p>That should be the real takeaway here. Make sure each rule of your style guide actually serves a purpose or that its supposed benefits outway its costs.",1441885695

That&#x27;s one class of bug.<p>This is exactly my point.  The fact that the programmer knows what the program should do implies that there exists knowledge outside of the program of what it should do.  This knowledge consititutes the requirements, whether they be written or not.",1441883402

Especially in the creative areas. I&#x27;m a musician half of the time, I struggled a lot with accepting that my &#x27;creative waves&#x27; come and go when they want - forcing output in moments where there was internal fire led me to big internal conflicts, up to something you could call &#x27;depression&#x27; (I find that word to be somewhat elusive) - even without any external pressure. Now being in a educational context that requires you to be creatively expressive on a  daily basis doesn&#x27;t even give you the option to have those breathing spaces. \nSo we had to chose: Power through and hope for the best, or (in my case) stop relying on institutional safety and just go for it. It takes courage, exponentially more with every day you already put in, but after years of doubt I&#x27;m very glad I did it this way. \nWhat I find to be universal: the job paranoia that drove us crazy faded very quickly once in the job market, in retrospect I can&#x27;t even reconstruct why I was so terrified: Keeping steady at doing something you love, listening a bit to the heart while quieting the mind and finding your flow .. and I&#x27;d be highly surprised if you end up not having any success at all.",1441883329

In the end, I see no reason to believe that exploitation doesn&#x27;t just waste a whole lot of resources and time, while also utterly destroying untold amounts of human dignity; and the more people put up with it, the harder it gets for those who resist.<p>This is not intended as a slight against your or anyone&#x27;s advice here, seriously.

If nobody feels responsible for causing it, who will fix it? The people who suffer a lot from it are too busy suffering or even dying, the overlap between finding this unbearable and having the means to fight it seems rather small.. sorry for ranting, but I guess with so much solid advice already given I thought I might as well :)",1441882977

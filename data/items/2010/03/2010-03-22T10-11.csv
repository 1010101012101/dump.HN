1209894,comment,1207494,1209220,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"You're missing the key points. The most important determining factor for the hardware footprint and overall throughput performance for the vast majority of web applications is not in the front-end but in the database. It doesn't matter if you write your front-end in C, PHP, or even LOL code the database calls are still going to dominate the hardware needs and performance characteristics of your application by a factor of 10-100. Spending your entire development budget to shave 10% or 1% of your hardware and performance overhead down to 5% or 0.5% is silly, which is why nobody does that.<p>Moreover, going down the list of low hanging fruit in terms of reducing cost and rendering time per page-view the option to switch to a ""more efficient"" language is so far down the list that it's almost never reached. Indeed, it's often more important to switch to a language that makes it easier to scale out to more hardware than it is to switch to a language which is abstractly faster at individual optimizations (again, macro-optimization trumps micro-optimization). The biggest performance improvement efforts tend to be orthogonal to development language entirely. For example, tuning your database design and DB server parameters, using extensive caching, cutting down on http request overhead, etc.<p>It's telling that a company like facebook (which has no shortage of developer talent) chose to spend its efforts on making PHP faster by building a new compiler for it rather than moving away from PHP to some other hypothetically more efficient language.<p>Efficiency is an important factor in web development, it can affect end-user performance, costs, and profitability. But it's rarely as significant as many people make it out to be. It's more important to build something that people care about than it is to build something extremely efficient. For the vast majority of sites, increasing the popularity of your site by 10-100x is far more important than reducing the server footprint by 2x, or even 10x.",1269252143

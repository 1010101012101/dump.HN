It seems like people forget that we had laws for punishing conduct we did not condone before the Internet, i.e. ones that never mentioned computers in any way. Back then they were called ""laws."" Why are these no longer applicable?",1246589930

685548,story,,,29,31,blacktastic,"Ask HN:  I have yet to do the one thing I wish before I die",,"The thing I want to do is to go back to college full time and major in mathematics.  I would like to get a master's/advanced degree in math (""maths"" if you are non-US :) ) and while doing so, ponder and study the queen of sciences.<p>I've made it to 41 years old. I am a software engineer, and I'm so-so at it. I self-studied my way to a C++ programming job after working my way from network admin to web developer to programmer to software engineer since 1999. I'm not even all that great at math.  But I failed my first programming course back in 1985, but I am now a well-paid professional. I know if I do a math program full time and work really hard, I can at least get to ""good"".<p>My one true joy is solving problems and I even enjoy figuring out proofs.  I have taken enough math courses to know I thoroughly enjoy the subject.  But there are no evening programs anywhere near my home to study math.  There are no part-time programs.  I would have to quit my job and find a way to finance myself through a proper math program.<p>I am willing to give up my current lifestyle and live in poverty to pursue this goal.<p>My question is, why shouldn't I do it?  What lies at the other end of the goal?   Am I crazy?  Have any of you done such a thing?  It feels like I am throwing my life to the wind.  But if I don’t do it, I will regret it the rest of my life.  Advice appreciated.",1246589589

685545,comment,685231,685433,0,0,kragen,,,"Well, because class stratification denies opportunities to people who are born to the wrong parents, drastically reducing the pool of innate talent that can actually be applied to solving society's problems, maybe. Or because lack of interchange between social groups brings those groups to misunderstand and fear one another, leading to violence between them (Japanese internment camps being an example inside the US in living memory). Or because groupthink results in intellectual stagnation and collective delusions.<p>It's true that there are a disproportionate number of upper-class twits on HN, while the twits on Reddit are mostly lower-class. But I don't hang out here because of the upper-class twits. I hang out here because it's a little less vulnerable to, among other things, delusional groupthink than Digg or Reddit.",1246589366

Property tax is almost always in proportion to the area of living space on the property.<p>Even anti-redistributionists acknowledge that taking 10% of the income of someone making $5e5 will reduce that person's lifestyle less than taking 10% of someone making $35k. I think the issue is more that this isn't the case -- the 500,001st dollar is taxed at a much higher rate than the 35,001st dollar.",1246589151

685535,comment,685441,685517,0,0,Locke1689,,,"Also, at the moment we only tax ""land"" -- meaning actual physical land, not space inhabited. Therefore, the truly rich could afford to construct difficult vertically engineered buildings, thus reducing their tax burden while simultaneously keeping a superhigh lifestyle. Meanwhile, many middle class who are wealthy enough to afford a home but not wealthy enough to afford a towering monstrosity would be taxed at a higher rate.<p>I am loath to use the term ""wealth redistribution"" because it tends to bring around the less thoughtful, but louder, segment of the population which rails against anything that remotely sounds like socialism. However, consider that this is one of the reasons for the progressive income tax. Essentially, money means less to you the more you have of it, especially considering that sustainable goods for comfortable life actually cost very little (thus meaning that taking ten percent of someone earning $35,000 dollars a year is far more likely to cut into their cost of living than taking ten percent of someone earning $500,000 dollars a year). One tax certainly introduces problems of point vulnerability, but it also brings up a problem with different taxes on different income brackets.",1246588013

You are correct in your statement that a RAC environment generally does require a DBA team and the cost overhead is significant.  Further, Oracle has very stringent hardware and OS certification and you will not receive any support from Oracle on uncertified systems.<p>However, I would not associate it with the ""cloud"" movement/paradigm/whatever.  It is a cluster (the C in RAC stands for cluster) with 2 or more instances sharing memory structures across a network.

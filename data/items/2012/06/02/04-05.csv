4057095,comment,4056790,4056790,6,0,jsz0,,,"Totally ignoring all the specific changes which are very debatable I think the biggest challenge Microsoft has is a significant number of PC owners are already on the fence about buying another PC. The one they have works OK and they have shifted a lot of their day-to-day computing to SmartPhones. Quite a few of them are already at least casually interested in the iPad instead of a new PC. When they look at Windows 8 they have to decide if it's worth investing the time to learn something new in an era when they are using their PC less than ever. It's kind of the perfect storm with a higher barrier of entry and a lower value proposition to the consumer in the end. Tablets are a different situation though I think it's also a huge uphill battle for different reasons.<p>The scary part is they have unintentionally interweaved the fate of all their different platforms together. If Windows 8 is a huge flop on the desktop who's going to buy a Windows 8 tablet or a Windows Phone? The Metro UI is unique enough that the taint of failure will stick to it. Metro could become the new Clippy. The mere sight of it could make people recoil in horror. No one could exactly tell you why they hated MS Bob, Clippy or Windows Vista. They just knew you were supposed to hate it because everyone hates it. If that happens with Metro Microsoft is looking at another 2-3 year 'reboot' and I just don't think they have that much slack left to work with.",1338612956

SJCL is used as the workhorse for encryption.<p>I know there's a prevalent view against doing crypto stuff in Javascript so extra precautions are taken to minimize the security risks.<p>- All web content (html, css, js, images) come from the same server.<p>- No download from any 3rd party websites or CDN.<p>- Use SSL certificate for all content to prevent code injection along the way.<p>- Encryption and decryption are done on the browser.<p>- Nothing is submitted to the server and no input shown to avoid XSS.<p>- Url fragment is used for encrypted data which stays on browser.<p>- Server doesn't do any encryption work besides serving the web content.<p>- The web pages can be downloaded and run off from the local file system.<p>- Have as few dependencies as possible, just: SJCL, Bootstrap (css), and html5.js.<p>- Keep things simple for verification.<p>Please review the app and code to see if there are any security concerns.

The actual test questions might ask something like ""How would you approach problem x, describe what language  you would use and how you might structure a program,"" or for multiple choice, ""Which of these is written using proper Python syntax"" etc. If you have to learn enough to pass the Pearson test in the end, you'll still have to put in a large chunk of time, making cheating downright impractical.<p>End result, this partly addresses one of the fundamental issues with online learning that Sebastin Thrun has talked about before, providing a form of physical identity verification and association with an online student username. Of course, someone could always pull a bait-and-switch in the physical testing center, but that's a whole other ball game.",1338611107

Apple may have come up with the perfect screen size for a SmartPhone circa 2007 but today the vast majority of SmartPhones sold in the world have larger displays so clearly 3.5"" cannot be the only perfect size. I do think they have stood by 3.5"" in part to see if this trend was just a temporary divergence. Now that is has endured for a couple years it's hard to ignore.<p>The other factor here is I think as Apple has scaled iOS to include more features they have begun to hit the wall of physical UI space. Let's use Safari as an example. If Apple wanted to add 2 new major features to Safari that had to be quickly accessible where would they even put them? The UI is just about full. They would have to increasingly rely on pop-out controls and other less-than-obvious UI tricks which adds extra taps. The situation is even worse when the keyboard is active taking up half the screen. With the status bar and maybe a visible app toolbar you have about a quarter of the screen available. Reading text messages on an iPhone has actually become painful. You can rarely see the entire message without scrolling or hiding the keyboard. A taller screen fixes that. They may just really need an extra ~170 pixels of height to keep scaling these apps with new features that require UI space.",1338610621

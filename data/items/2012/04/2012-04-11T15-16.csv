3828115,comment,3827408,3827408,19,0,nikcub,,,"Those numbers sounded too low, which prompted me to look into it.<p>They were both featured on other editions of Techcrunch, not the main site. One was on Techcrunch UK[1], with a short post, the other on Techcrunch TV (way down with a single link in a short story)[2], both before the merge.<p>To say that it is important to the point of the story to mention that they weren't featured on the main Techcrunch site is an understatement. While the EU and TV properties pre-merger were doing well, the main site is an order of magnitude larger.<p>I used to work at TC, but I still refer a lot of startups there for stories and have been keeping up with the numbers. You can expect referrals in the range of a few thousand to up to 40k. In terms of the 'startup' space (that is anything funding related, launch announcements, hiring announcements etc.) there is usually no better outlet, since every single venture capitalist, journalist, blogger, entrepreneur, potential executive employee etc. reads the site.<p>The exception is if you are in a niche which can be better served by other blogs.<p>Being featured on Techcrunch usually leads to a couple of more blog posts from other sites, and it can usually lead to appearing on Techmeme - which every tech blogger and journalists checks regularly every day.<p>There is no doubt that with a good product a mainstream media feature will get you more long-term users. Every startup and announcement is different, you need to take all fo this into account when considering where and how you want to release your news.<p>What I can tell you is that a feature on TC definitely doesn't send referrals in the dozens - I think the post should be updated to clarify that.<p>--<p>Update: I just got a response from the author of the OP on Twitter. When I asked him why there was no mention of his stories being on TC Europe and no links to them, he replied[3]: ""I actually did, I'm not sure why but they seem to have disappeared in the editing process. I'll try to get them put back in."" and ""Btw, both were featured on the TC Europe homepage in the main stream. I appreciate it probably should be more clear.""<p>It is probably worth mentioning at this point that 'the editor' of The Kernel (although he may not have been the editor of this post), Milo, was the same guy who wrote the story on TC[1] referred to in the post. He worked at TC Europe and is now the editor at The Kernel - they somehow talked around this fact in the post without mentioning it.<p>I just pinged him on Twitter to ask if he removed the references or if they were simply just lost somehow.<p>--<p>Update 2: Further, from the author: ""Mm, but this was a while back (2009), Milo has made no secret of being frustrated with TC Europe. I'm writing of my own volition."" [5] and ""I don't think missing links was intentional. I had also linked to Jottify and a few other things and they're also missing.""[6]<p>From Milo: (when asked if he was editor on that post): ""Hi there. No I wasn't - but I will nip in and make clear""[7]<p>The links may have been dropped, but there is still no distinction in the actual content that the post isn't about the main Techcrunch site.<p>--<p><i>note the link is now to techcrunch.com but that is because the sites have been merged</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/enovella-gives-aspiring-authors-and-poets-somewhere-to-share/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2009/08/10/enovella-gives-aspiring-aut...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/07/techcrunch-tv-three-startup-pitches-from-the-future-of-web-apps-conference/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/07/techcrunch-tv-three-startup...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190121611578441728"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190121611578441728</a><p>[4] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190122178547691520"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190122178547691520</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190126807595495425"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190126807595495425</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190127630606020608"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/jacklenox/status/190127630606020608</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://twitter.com/#!/Nero/status/190127568152838144"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/#!/Nero/status/190127568152838144</a>",1334159799

3828111,comment,3827406,3827451,5,0,gbog,,,"> Something is missing, and i just cant quite put my finger on it.<p>It is missing ""Google"". For me Google means plain flat interfaces to best-of-breed tools (search, maps, mail). Many of their new tools (Play, Google +) are trying to resemble an iPad app. That's not Google's DNA, maybe. (Only maybe, because Chrome is the one tool they made that have this sexy look while keeping, for me, the pure Google DNA.)<p>In fact, I think Google may, one day, want give up doing business things. Look, they have plenty of ad money coming in the safe for years. I won't say they don't deserve it but instead of paying very clever people trying to beat Facebook, trying to have a better ad model, scratching their head on how to place an icon on the left (or right? or top?) with which gradient to have the ""best"" interaction, or even trying to make AR glasses, they could just give up on these childish tasks and just become the real New University of the 21st.<p>Ok, it is off-topic, but think about it: so many great brains, with enough money to pay them. They could be teaching everyone many fields of Science, and beyond, for free. They could scratch their head on how to get more food for less water, and write about it. Each Googler would have to publish one thing every week, on their channel of choice. A central feed would list them. Free access to knowledge. That, would be grand.

3828109,comment,3826364,3827053,4,0,kstenerud,,,"Yes, and everything's fine until something blows up. Then you need to know what's going on at a lower level to be able to fix it.<p>Case in point: I once had a co-worker show me a Java crash report from a crash that nobody could figure out. Every now and again, the server, Tomcat, JVM and all, would just die, spitting out a stack trace that went into native land.<p>One really nice thing on the crash report was a full register dump, stack address dump, and a dump of the memory around the PC. So I disassembled the memory, figured out that it was calling memcpy when it died, and lo-and-behold, one of the register operands was 0! A comparison of the stack addresses showed that it was dying in a library used for biometric fingerprint based authentication.<p>The vendor kept insisting that the problem was on our side (we had a JNI library of our own that called their library, but I desk checked it twice and concluded that it was fine), so I disassembled the whole library and traced what it was doing. It turns out that certain kinds of incomplete fingerprint scans wouldn't trigger a rejection at the high level, but would cause a rejection at the lower levels (almost... it would clear the pointer to the data but would then return TRUE instead of FALSE). The library would then carry on its merry way passing a null pointer lower and lower until it died in memcpy, taking the JVM with it.",1334159735

I found something which needed implementing and decided to have a little go at implementing it. After a bit of discussion on the mailing list, i came up with a fairly minimal implementation which was a good starting point at least, and posted a ticket to the tracker.<p>For about 7 months nobody seemed to take much notice of the ticket, when all of a sudden i got a message: someone else had independently worked a new implementation, and only just noticed the ticket.

It's built on a faulty assumption - that ""who"" is the sole determinant of whether or not I'm interested in something.  That's not even close to true, unfortunately.  I have plenty of social-network connections for whom I value their posts on certain <i>topics</i> and have less-than-zero interest in what they have to say about other things.

I really want a way in G+ to filter out posts by those people that don't have anything to do with the shared interest.<p>For example, if I create a ""Functional Programming"" circle and subscribe to a bunch of Haskell, Ocaml, ML, Lisp, and Scheme programmers that I don't know IRL, I'm really not interested in their vacation photos and whatnot.  But currently there's no way to filter their vacation photo posts from their posts on functional programming.<p>An effective 90% solution would be to simply add hash tag filtering to circles, so I can instruct my Functional Programming circle to only accept posts with #functional, #functionalprogramming, #haskell, #ocaml, #ml, #lisp, #scheme, and block anything else without at least one of those hash tags in it.<p>Not quite perfect, and G+'ers would have to develop the habbit of using hashtags more than they currently do, but it's functional and flexible enough and provides the tools necessary for the community to solve this problem themselves.<p>This is my biggest G+ pain point, and while I have nothing negative to say about the redesign (it's nice), as long as it doesn't solve this one problem, it will do nothing to get me using G+ more (I check in about 2 or 3 times a week currently).",1334158648

If you are in one of the two houses of parlament you can put in a motion that tells what it is you want to achive. This gets votet on by both houses and if it pases both it gets to the bundesrat (witch are just the 7 big ministers, one for law, one for inner, one for outer ....) they have to produce a acctual law bases on that motion. This law gets then voted on by both houses. If it passes you have a new law. Jet it often happens that somebody does not like such a law, if that happens the can take a ""referendum"" with means that the have to get (i think) 50'000 signatures and that forces a real vote with the hole country. That happens quite often because the ""referendum"" is pretty easy to do.<p>An example of this whas when they wanted to join the EG, the right wing took the referendum and won the vote after that.<p>The other way is more people driven. If you want something to happen (a basic income or prhibitation of minaretts) you have to collect (i think) 100'000 signatures and this then again results in a vote.<p>Simular systems exist on ""kantons"" level.

Most Java people have some ideas of how the JVM works, but few can jump to (say) the JVM's memory allocator code  (even when available) in order to fix problems.<p>In any case, does a Java programmer need to know chip layout design in order to program, or do you agree that that is ""some layer below which is unnecessary to understand""? Yes, someone, somewhere, might have had a problem in Java code caused by noise leaking across from one circuit to another, but you can't seriously expect that most people will be able to jump there if needed.",1334157827

Developers (agents) can charge whatever they want, but clearly that doesn't equate to automatic sales at whatever price.  It is in fact a very competitive market.<p>Nothing about the agency model, as I see it, in the example of the App Store has even a hint of being anti-competitive.<p>How is this different for books?  I just don't see it.  But I am open to explanations.<p>If anything is anti-competitive, it is selling at a loss so that nobody else can enter the market.  That is what Amazon was doing.<p>Price fixing requires collusion between the producers to all sell at the same price point.  It's certainly possible this is going on with the big publishers in Apple's store, but that doesn't require Apple's participation in the collusion.  It doesn't exonerate Apple either, it's orthogonal.<p>In the wholesale model that traditional booksellers and Amazon use, it's still possible for publishers to price fix.

While there are some areas where 1.9 branches gave up ground (I'm looking at you `require` [1]), there are other areas where it absolutely smokes older versions; like date formatting functions [2]. Fortunately, Rails processes run for a long time under most app servers, so the performance regression of `require` isn't a huge deal. It is, however, very common to format dates as part of output, which may happen on hundres or thousands of records. There are also some nice features of 1.9 branches that are useful in a practical sense. For example, hash order is presered in Hash under 1.9, so you can get the extra features of a hash, and avoid superfulous sorting (can result in big compute savings).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/bradland/require-benchmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/bradland/require-benchmarks</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1352997"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1352997</a>",1334156681

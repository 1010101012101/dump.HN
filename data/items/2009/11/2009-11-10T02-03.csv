It is my belief that far too many folks have gone for MBA degrees and that they no longer really work for sifting employees. Anecdotally, there are several programmers I know who have MBAs working in my company and it has done nothing for them.<p>As for myself, I'm working on a masters in accounting. It is a business masters, so it meets the requirement for a business masters degree, but one that I think opens a couple additional options. I live in CO, and here (as well as MA), one can sit for the CPA exam with a masters in accounting (with no on-the-job time hired as an accounting). For me, this is one of my ""Plan B"" strategies to possibly transition out of IT. A CPA with a background in IT should be able to do well with sox/cobit/sas70 auditing.<p>For yourself, the question should be along the lines of ""do you want to move into management"" or ""do you want to stay in technology."" Because I think the answer to that question decides what degree to go for (and really, I can't answer that for you, I can only say ""I did X and why"" and perhaps that might be useful to help you decide).

The problem is one of our developer Founders who did some Rails development for us left and now we are left with myself and another developer who is not well versed with Rails.<p>I used to be a very good Programmer in School and I know that I can do a good job programming, but I am the business guy now, not having much time to learn Rails development. The lack of time almost always discourages me to learn Rails, since there are so many other things on my plate. But at the same time, it is gating progress.<p>The other developer believes that we should outsource our Rails development. Have we accumulated a lot of technical debt as a result of  the old Rails developer leaving us? How do we fix this situation? Also, the other developer Founder is more inclined to manage rather than coding. I believe the startup's founder should build the core offering themselves.<p>So following are my questions, so that we can get unstuck:<p>1. Do I learn Rails and come up to speed so that I can start contributing in a big way. What is the best approach for this goal? What kind of a timeframe am I looking at?
2. Should we hire a Rails developer to take things forward for us? Is outsourcing an option considering we want to get our core offering developed?
3. Should I be looking for a Founder who is a kickass programmer?
4. Should we consider switching the development platform to the one that my other Developer Founder is comfortable with. Because even if we want to manage a Rails developer, my partner may not be able to do justice because he is not too well versed with the platform himself<p>Any kind of advice would be helpful.

806482,comment,806407,806407,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Being accepted or not by YC has very little bearing on whether a startup can be successful or not, I do not expect there to be any significant correlation between YC rejected companies and accepted ones (in terms of success).<p>They simply have a limited amount of time.<p>What I do think you will find is that those that are bitter about a rejection tend to cluster around the failure point, mostly because they will be looking to externalize their reason for failure. That may come in many different guises, such as 'we would have succeeded if we had been accepted' or 'we will prove they should have accepted us'.<p>Just take it as an opportunity to accelerate do not worry too much about who gets accepted and who does not.<p>YC likely got it wrong a number of times, as long as they use objective criteria (only known to themselves) and gut calls on who they choose to work with (which can just be a personal feelings issue) they are totally free to make their decisions.<p>It's their time and money after all.",1252155404

So hopefully the question was not just about file-sharing but actually about sharing music files that the owner didn't have rights to use.<p>Like you say, this is problematic, it requires the respondent to make a legal decision on an issue which may not be determined yet in caselaw and so may be an open question : can I dl music files that I've bought already on CD for example.

806471,comment,806409,806409,0,0,patio11,,,"I'll admit, this got me to do a quick sweep of my dozen or so WP blogs and make sure they were all updated.  That said, I think its likely we're seeing TechCrunch Journalism (TM) in action.<p>Wordpress security is a pain in the keister, though.  You can reduce your risk by:<p>1)  Making regular backups (I like automysqlbackup.sh.)  Comprehensive compromise of a Wordpress installation is only really recoverable by wiping and starting over, unless you want to find that your forgotten posts from 3 years ago are linking to viagra pharmacies.<p>2)  Putting every Wordpress installation in its own DB with its own DB user.  Don't use root.  I have a script which installs WP for me and creates the new DB, creates the new user, and gives the user an insanely difficult password because it will never actually be typed by a human.<p>3)  Making sure the Wordpress directories can't get written to by the server.  I go as far as blocking the uploads, which means I have to do some chmod magic when uploading things.<p>4)  If you can put up with the nuisance, protect the wp-admin directory at the web server level, for example by denying all IPs but your own, or by putting it under HTTP Basic authentication.  That will cut down drastically on the number of automated probes that hit you.  You don't have to run faster than the tiger, you just have to run faster than the other guy the tiger is chasing...",1252154513

If YC looks at 1000 ideas, and thinks 100 are good - they still can't take all 100 (because they don't have the space/funding).<p>Therefore a company being rejected from YC may have nothing to do with whether or not YC wanted them.

806467,comment,806052,806052,0,0,yardie,,,"I'll take a guess and say easy access to credit for creditless students. Plus universities have big 5 year plans with that money; money allocated before the recession. So most of the capital improvement projects were started when students, parents, and gov't were looser with the purse strings.<p>And universities somehow never follow the rules of economics. Scales of economy fail to kick in when they should. Large schools get larger and the price per student creeps up, never down. And the building projects get more extravagant and expensive.\nAt my alma mater you see where the money is going. Old buildings were built like a brick shithouse. Strong and cheap with a fallout shelter. The new ones look like the set designer of MTVs Real World was given the comission. Instead of 2 per room. One student a room for a spacious 4 room suite. Instead of brick and stone we've got glass and steel. This wouldn't be bad if alumni paid for them, but when they are named ""New student residence 2008"" it means they are waiting for a large donation for a building thats already built and paid for by students.",1252154193

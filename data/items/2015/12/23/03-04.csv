10781867,comment,10781561,10781561,0,0,ianamartin,,,"My experience, for what ever this is worth, was interesting when I was teaching kids.<p>I taught violin and music theory for a University prep program when I was in the later years of my undergrad.<p>A few things stuck out at me when I was doing this, and keep in mind--I had no classes on education theory at all at the time. I was just a good, gifted performer who had done some serious study of music theory. Music Theory emerges from the Philosophy of the time, so teaching about that is also teaching about the history of Western thought and also the social climate of the different periods of time that you are covering with music. Along with that comes the baggage of the Catholic church. The history of &quot;Classical Music&quot; is much aligned with the history of the Church.<p>So there&#x27;s a lot to cover.<p>I learned a ton from this experience, and it was good for me, and -- I hope -- good for my students.<p>Some things I learned from this in no particular order:<p>In a one-to-one setting with a young student, as in really young, like 4-5 years old, where you are trying to teach difficult things, get down on your knees. That young kid is looking at an unfamiliar giant who is now telling them to do things they don&#x27;t understand. They are still looking at you and wondering what the fuck is happening. Get to eye level with that kid. The kid will be far more focused than if they are looking at what they think of as a giant stranger.<p>Time yourself. If you are going to work on some really demanding physical and mental things with kids like learning to hear and play an instrument, give the kid a break every 10 minutes or so. The formula I ended up with at this gig was to do 10 minutes of supervised practice on instrument mechanics and then 5 minutes or so of theory.<p>Across a range of &quot;talent&quot; levels, I was able to produce pretty amazing progress with this method because you can keep a 5-year-old&#x27;s interest for a lot longer if you are changing things up every so often.<p>I could do an hour or two with a young kid, where other teachers were losing steam and traction with the students after a half hour.<p>I never beat any kids, or hit them in any way. I grew up in that environment, and I thought it was awful as a kid. As an adult I find it even more repulsive. It&#x27;s not, in my opinion, necessary for high achievement. And in my personal experience, it was detrimental.<p>In a classroom situation, I feel like you are sort of stuck. You have to present things as best you can and hope that everyone gets it. But you can have some creative control sometimes. I remember teaching one theory class to a wide range of kids. All of my students got locked into one history class at the prep school. So I had kids who were 5-6 years old and kids who were close to my own age at the time (I was 19, and the oldest students were 17).<p>That&#x27;s tough, and I don&#x27;t have anything to offer someone stuck in that situation. But it is possible to come up with a curriculum that can work for this assuming that everyone in the class in equally ignorant. It&#x27;s just hard to do.<p>Don&#x27;t be a male teaching any underage female past puberty one-on-one. Just don&#x27;t do it. I never got into trouble, but I know many totally innocent people who have. I&#x27;m sure it works the other way. But there&#x27;s a lot of emotion going on in pubescent kids, and they are likely to have confused romantic feelings about figures of authority who are not abusive. Just don&#x27;t get close to that situation.<p>The last thing I want to say from my experience is that kids like to be treated with respect. That&#x27;s part of the getting down on your knees thing. Another part of respect is to just assume that they will behave well and create an environment in which it makes sense for them to behave well. Talk to them like adults. Give them the freedom to fail and make mistakes.<p>They usually will not fail. They will usually step up to the challenge and do some amazing things.",1450843063

I find it hard to explain but GitHub does have the right amount of white/empty space to make consumption of information easier.  I&#x27;ve always hated the simplicity of GitHub&#x27;s layout, but after studying their commits and branches pages for my product, I&#x27;ve grown to appreciate their simplicity.<p>It&#x27;s the little things that GitHub does, that I&#x27;ve found makes the difference.

Seeing a wall of branches is okay ... when that&#x27;s what you want, but as a default, by organizing it the way that GitHub does, they make their branches page significantly easier to consume.<p>I also find the buttons too be a little too big in GitLab and they don&#x27;t have enough definition to them, to help you focus on them. Creating merge requests and comparing branches is the focal point of the branches page, and they should make it easier for your eyes to lock onto them.<p>Like I said, it&#x27;s the little things that I can&#x27;t explain that I&#x27;ve come to respect and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s just because we are familar with GitHub.",1450842759

And as I have written about it 4 years ago (<a href=""http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=61"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.zorinaq.com/?e=61</a>) the fact is there <i>are</i> experiments conducted by multiple other groups of researchers that demonstrate anomalous heat being produced by nickel-hydrogen cells.

Unfortunately the controversy about this entire area of research is amplified by the fact that many of these experiments are very hard to reproduce.<p>Research has made some progress over the last 4 years, and my opinion has not changed: whatever mechanism is taking place, it seems to be able to unleash fantastic amounts of energy from very little material.

In practice, any real-world C implementation will allow you to call the main function without overflowing the stack, and that much is obvious, otherwise nobody would use those implementations, so it should be taken as a a given, an axiom.<p>Why doesn&#x27;t the C standard guarantee a minimum stack size? Because there could be tiny microcontrollers with just 64 bytes of stack on which you can implement some C subset. At the same time, the standard doesn&#x27;t want to define specifics of stack frame layouts, so, not knowing how much memory is available on your target machine, and not wanting to constrain how a stack frame for some source function is laid out as part of the C standard, it&#x27;s impossible to compute how deep you can go on your call stack without architectural details, it&#x27;s implementation dependent.

10781781,comment,10773316,10776452,0,0,crdb,,,"This is true of ALL arts and endeavours more generally: that it takes years of first hand experience to be able to appreciate the last stretch of 80/20 (i.e. the last 20% that takes 80% of the effort to achieve). On top of this, there are many things unique to Japanese (Kamakura period and later) philosophy that one should understand to gain contextual awareness.<p>For an example that will be close to the HN readership, to a freshly graduated Harvard MBA and former McKinsey consultant with a BA in Economics, a self-taught full stack web developer with a couple years experience is for all intents and purposes the same in skills as an MIT post-doc in computer science with a few papers published (I&#x27;ve also met some &quot;business&quot; folks who think the web dev is &quot;superior&quot; because he &quot;gets things done&quot; and his output is &quot;prettier&quot;).<p>I personally think that one should achieve depth in at least one field to appreciate just how hard it is to get to the top of it. As a former classical musician, I can absolutely tell the difference between a good pianist such as you might find playing on a typical night at the Lincoln Centre in New York, and a &quot;once in a generation&quot; pianist such as Richter; this came at the cost of perhaps 2 decades of purposeful study and practicing the art. But my friends with little experience of classical music do not get quite as excited about Richter.<p>The Japanese are also unique due to the history of their country shaping their philosophy of art (which I will try to summarize based on my very limited understanding - I&#x27;d love to be corrected by more knowledgeable readers).<p>The Heian-period aristocrats, who looked up to the mainland Chinese civilisation, became so decadent and self-focused in their seeking of ever increasing sophistication that they completely lost interest in the running of their own country and the resulting chaos led to the rise of warlords (Daimyo) and a ruling military elite structure based in many parts on fighting ability (this is not unique to Japan: &quot;may they eat cake!&quot;).<p>The Heian period marked spirits (exiling someone from court for having composed a distasteful poem or wearing a slightly mismatched ensemble being, generally, not a good governance principle). So when the Daimyo stopped fighting each other, united under the Tokugawa shogunate, thus having more time to do things other than get good at fighting [1], they sought to display status in other less flashy ways (this did happen later - cf the Rinpa school of painting), a form of counter-signalling based on taste rather than wealth, such as the very materially simple tea ceremony and teahouse. In other words, it&#x27;s not about the tea, but about the way it is served and the contextual notes. This was helped by the idea that Spartans make better warriors than hedonists.<p>On top of this and perhaps linked (&quot;dying a good warrior death young, is more honorable and valuable than dying old in your bed having not fought&quot;), the philosophy of art tends towards valuing things like the &quot;ephemeral nature of life&quot; and making very subtle statements related to it. For example, there is a phenomenon in Japan of &quot;the first tuna catch of the year&quot; which is a very expensive and prized fish, almost a celebration. But for you, that&#x27;s just a slice of tuna, and chemically, it might just be the very same composition as much of the tuna on offer the rest of the year. It would be missing the point - it is the act of catching the first tuna of the year (or it might be the first tuna caught after they come back from a migration where they get fat or something - it&#x27;s seasonal, I can&#x27;t remember the details), and the eating of that tuna at that particular time, that is valued by the consumer. Similarly, the rice is designed to be served at a specific temperature, and to &quot;just&quot; hold together at that temperature and with that mix and at that amount of time after being hand shaped for you, and an experienced consumer will appreciate the texture and cooking level of the rice and be satisfied to have had the experience of that precise moment in time and the ephemeral nature of it, much more than by any feeling of satiety.<p>Now personally I am happy eating the sushi at the standing sushi stand at Tokyo Station in B1 of the Yaesu exit (Uogashi?). That&#x27;s as good as I can tell the difference and the cheapest I know (around $10-20 a go). So, I&#x27;ll probably never fork out $400 for Jiro, because I know that&#x27;s where my limit lies and I couldn&#x27;t appreciate the conversation anyway (which is a great part of the experience, and why Jiro proper doesn&#x27;t allow non-Japanese speakers to book). But that&#x27;s also because I do not wish to invest time and effort into getting to a knowledge level where I could truly appreciate Jiro. I&#x27;m also avoiding attending any No theatre performances because, again, have no desire to spend years studying the art.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s good to decide whether or not you want to gain depth in a field; if so, time to put in serious effort and do much reading; if not, one should (in my opinion) be aware of one&#x27;s limits and unknown unknowns and not worry too much about not appreciating said field. But there is absolutely an objective level of difference between the top performers and the middling ones in all fields, even if outsiders cannot perceive it instinctively.<p>[1] As an example of the discussions of the transition period: 47 of a few hundred samurai that saw their master being betrayed and killed plotted revenge for two years, then executed it (google &quot;47 Ronin&quot;, if you didn&#x27;t see the Keanu movie). In the Hagakure, Tsunetomo criticizes the 47 Ronin for not having immediately committed seppuku, which even if not achieving revenge, would have been the honorable thing to do, instead of deciding to live. Tsunetomo was in turn criticized as being too much of a typical peacetime warrior, choosing honour and appearances over winning, in contrast to a Miyamoto Musashi whose methods were not always clean (such as arriving late to his duels to put the adversary off balance) allowing him a legendary record of victories. Or indeed Ieyasu Tokugawa himself.",1450841296

At some point when <i>designing</i> a rocket, it&#x27;s better to add performance to the second stage rather than the first. But when presented with an existing rocket, you&#x27;ll achieve maximum payload capacity by burning all fuel in the first stage before staging. Every second it burns is more delta-v imparted to the payload. The only reason you&#x27;d stage early is if you want to save fuel for e.g. a landing attempt, if the first stage is too powerful and the acceleration or speed would become too great, or if you simply don&#x27;t need the extra performance to get the payload to where it&#x27;s supposed to go.",1450840736

10781757,comment,10773849,10774023,0,0,careersuicide,,,"Assuming you want to learn modern x86-64 assembly your best bet is to start by learning C well enough to write simple toy programs on your own. If you know enough C to understand what a bit of totally uninteresting code like<p><pre><code>  int foo(int a, int b) {\n      int c = a + b;\n\n      int d = a * b;\n\n      return c + d;\n  }\n\n  int main() {\n      return foo(4, 5);\n  }\n</code></pre>\ndoes then you&#x27;re more than ready to start diving into assembly. Using either Clang or GCC take your simple programs (like the one above) and compile them with the following options<p><pre><code>  clang -O0 -S -f-no-asynchronous-unwind-tables foo.c\n</code></pre>\nThis will output a file called foo.s. Open it up and you should see the unoptimized assembly equivalent of the machine code the compiler would generate for your program (sans stuff involving linking). For the sake of brevity I&#x27;ll omit it from this post.<p>Start off with very very simple programs and examine their output. Change the source slightly and observe how the assembly changes. And as usual when learning new stuff, google everything that doesn&#x27;t make sense. If you come across an instruction you&#x27;ve never seen before then google it, odds are just knowing what it does will make its purpose obvious for simple enough programs. Starting with simple stuff really is the key. Eventually you can even try writing your own version in assembly first and then compare it to what the compiler gives you for an equivalent C program. Sometimes the results will be very surprising and you&#x27;ll learn something interesting.<p>One thing I will say you should read up on first is the System V ABI (<a href=""http://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.osdev.org/System_V_ABI</a>). Assuming you&#x27;re on Linux or OSX. It&#x27;s the function calling convention used by modern systems. You don&#x27;t have to use it yourself necessarily, but when you examine compiler generated assembly or if you want to know how to call libc functions understanding it is crucial.<p>I&#x27;m by no means an expert on assembly, but this is what I did and I&#x27;m at a place now where I&#x27;m comfortable looking at most pieces of assembly code and following along. Writing it is still hard, but mostly because it takes so damn long and higher level languages have spoiled me.",1450840633

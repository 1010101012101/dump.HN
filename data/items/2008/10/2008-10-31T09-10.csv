In the meantime, reprocessing the waste and storing the remaining waste somewhere safe seems like a prudent enough plan. If we can't find a way to get rid of it by the time we start running out of space, we stop using nuclear energy. We'll be far better prepared to switch over to solar et al at that point, assuming that nuclear is currently significantly more cost-effective than the alternatives.",1225445841

But most people who write documents don't use TeX. That might be because TeX seems to prefer using its own custom font system which doesn't work with any of their fonts, and lacks and modern GUI. TeX <i>should</i> have, and could have, been Word, with an emphasis on structure.<p>The projects goals came from its Wikipedia page, which admittedly isn't referenced.",1225445508

What's the signal carried by a high vote on a comment?

349791,comment,349512,349512,0,0,berryg,,,"It is all about political will. Germany has shown the world that it is possible. And it is made possible via a so-called feed-in tariff scheme. 14% of Germany's energy originates from renewable energy sources (mainly wind power). And Germany will reach 20% by 2013 and will reach 30% by 2030. Germany is now the largest producer of PV panels and among the largest producers of wind turbines. Gemany's alternative energy plan created a huge industry. So, less dependency on foreign energy, less CO2 emission and the creation of a lot of jobs. Sounds to me like a winning strategy.

349790,comment,349746,349778,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I don't think the first worm is comparable to modern viruses, at all.  For one thing, the intention was (mostly) innocent, but things got out of control (young folks are often completely blind to the ""what's the worst that could happen?"" side of things).  For another, most folks viewed it as a necessary bump in the road on the path to wider spread Internet usage.  There were numerous serious security flaws in the wild that simply were not being patched.  I remember the aftermath of the worm, and most of my geeky friends thought rtm got a bum wrap over the whole thing, when it became a legal matter.  (We were all doing far more willfully malicious things in our small town way.  Phreaking, warez, etc. was how nerds without access to the Internet got up to no good back then.)<p>The worm is also part of why modern BIND and Sendmail have reasonably good security records.  No one took security seriously until then...but for the Internet to be as successful as it has been, security has to be the first and last thing any developer thinks about.",1225443919

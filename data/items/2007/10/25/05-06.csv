One of the advantages of building web applications is that people on any platform (pretty much) can run your application. Microsoft has been trying to maintain their Windows desktop monopoly by pushing technologies to write websites that only work with Windows/IE. Once again I don't know if SilverLight suffers from this but knowing Microsoft I would guess it does.",1193291916

It is a matter of usability and <i>general</i> design.<p>A friend of mine works in a company that develops airport traffic control software. More than one time I heard him say how the features that are pumped into the software are not features that are wanted by the users, but by managers that are responsible for buying the software.<p>In telecommunications, where I have a little more experience, it is similar. Things that we were supposed to work on are not the things that people required. I spent a whole year on a team of 15 SDEs developing a bunch of ""features"" that would never be seen or used, but that <i>had</i> to be developed if you want to have a Class-5 Phone Switch that complies with Brazilian regulations.<p>\n",1193291781

72375,comment,72367,72367,0,0,cstejerean,,,"The title of this makes it sound like MzScheme actually can compete with Python when it comes to renaming files. It very well could do so just fine if you rename files all day long and write some libraries for yourself to do use for this. If that's the case it can probably be solved more beautifully in Scheme or Lisp than Python.",1193291104
72374,comment,72291,72291,0,0,gigamon,,,"I plan to write about this in a future post on my blog.<p>My experience is that LLC (Limited Liability Company) is a much better vehicle for starting a company than a S-Corp. LLC is an interesting hybrid between a corporation (S or C) and a partnership. <p>Legally LLC is not a corporation but more like a partnership. But it is an effective shield for limiting your personal liability the same way that a corporation would, yet at the same time, doesn't require the declaration of a liability-bearing general partner which is what you have to do with a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP).<p>Also, from the customer perspective, an LLC sounds a lot like a corporation so it doesn't have the stigma that comes with an LLP (people think of dentist, doctor and lawyer when you present them a business card that says LLP). Just like LLP or a S-Corp, an LLC is not a taxable entity so losses and profits can flow directly to the partners. <p>On the other hand, unlike an S-Corp, the profit and loss can be distributed anyway that is agreeable to the partners and not necessary according to the percentage ownership, which is very convenient.  <p>Also, LLC has no limitation on foreign ownership or ownership by another corporation (Until it became AT&T again, Cingular was a LLC owned by SBC and BellSouth).<p>All it takes to form a LLC is an operating agreement, which is not even a legal document and does not need to be filed. So you don't need a lawyer to do what is basically common sense. So be sure you spell out the ownership structure of the LLC (there is no reason why it has to be equal but there is no reason why it cannot be, so whatever is agreeable to all partners is fine). <p>But be sure to spell out the circumstances when a particular partner is deemed non-contributing and therefore can be invited out by the rest of the partnership.  Also, spell out what happens to his/her shares if any partner was to resign, to be terminated with and without clause, incapacitated and death (either work-related or not). <p>So a typical solution is to give everyone three or four years to vest and everyone agree that any shares that are unvested can be repurchased by the remaining partners at the original price.  Also, make sure that everyone agrees to a right-of-first-refusal and a co-sale arrangement so that if one partner decides to sell his/her vested shares, everyone else has the right to either buy the shares or to sell part of their own vested shares to the same outside buyer at the same time. <p>Furthermore, make sure you put a price on the shares so that everyone writes a check and buy the shares outright (which can be very low so that the total is on the order of a few hundred dollars).  This is very important because once the stock is purchased, you have started the clock for capital gain and keep in mind that these are 1244 stock which means that if you keep them for five years (which you probably will since that's how long it will take to build a company if not more), then only half of your capital gain is taxable. <p>There are other benefits as well but the most important one is that if you ever leave your own startup, you can walk away with property that you already owned and you don't have to worry about exercising your options and get hit with Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT).<p>On the other hand, for working capital, ask everyone to put in the cash as an interest-bearing loan so that when the company starts making profits, you can get the money back without any tax consequence. <p>Also, even as a LLC, you can elect to file your tax return as a S-Corp.  This is important because as you continue to bootstrap your company, instead of paying the partners salaries, you can pay everyone a nominal stipend (which is subject to payroll tax) and declare the rest dividend, which is not subject to self-employment tax (it would be if you file tax return as a LLC).<p>Finally, when you are ready to take VC money, they will want to bring in a high-power lawyer and chances are that they will want you to form a C-Corp. By then, you can do a tax-free transfer between assets of the LLC and shares of the new company. The VC's are going to put a vesting schedule on your new shares, which you will need to negotiate. But hopefully by then you have some leverage (like customers and profitability) and you can negotiate from a position of strength.<p>But the most important issue here is that with a C-Corp you can start from a clean slate and any amateurish decision that you might have made in the past (which served the purpose at the time) is now completely in the past.<p>Hope this helps.<p>--Denny--<p>Denny K Miu<p>Startup For Less X Survival Guide for Bootstrapping Entrepreneurs<p><a href=""http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/startup-for-less.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lovemytool.com/blog/startup-for-less.html</a>\n",1193291050

Granted I dont know if its all true, only regurgitating what I have researched and read. It's actually not that bloated and is supposed to run javascript about a 1000 time faster since its compiled and not interpreted. It will be interesting to see how it develops and competes with flash.<p>I agree that keeping up with the many languages is difficult. But it's necessary if you want to be the best and on top of the game. Test drive a lot of different languages and pick the one that meets your needs and feels most comfortable. Sometimes driving more then one language is the best option.<p>We could argue until we are all blue in the face about what the best language is and what the next ""big one"" will be. I wouldn't focus as much on the language in 10 years, no one is looking to utilize that today. The future is important (as many get rich making it) but keep in mind a lot of companies that have been ahead of there time got bit in the ass from it.",1193289624

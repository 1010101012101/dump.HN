Which will always involve unaligned reads from buffer <i>somewhere</i>.<p>The only real way I can see it being misused in a way that results in poor performance is if you read data into an explicitly-packed struct and then pass a reference to it around everywhere, reading from it willy-nilly instead of extracting the values once.",1324429017

3375902,comment,3375651,3375651,2,0,blix,,,"This article misses the mark completely, both by extrapolating medicine to science as a whole, and by attacking the idea of causation rather than the sketchy practices of medicine.<p>All of the examples are pulled from medicine, notorious for its lack of experimental rigor. To say that ""Science has failed us"" implies that either medicine is the the only important science or that all science is equally as sloppy, which is pretty insulting to a scientist in any harder field.<p>His focus on causation is even more misguided. The very purpose of science is to understand the way the world works; to understand what causes what. To attack the idea of causation is to attack the very idea of science, and in turn all of the advances it's brought about over the past 300 years. Beyond that, we implicitly accept causation in almost every aspect of our lives (Pressing the space bar causes a space to appear, etc). Certainly causes can't be 'seen' like facts, but to suggest that this trivializes them, or somehow makes them less useful is nonsense (and, for what it's worth, is total misreading of Hume).<p>Complexity isn't a valid reason either. Some very well understood systems are incredibly complex (look at the computer you are using now). What is true is that like all other humans, scientists make mistakes. We often make the incorrect causal links or are influenced by our biases. This is why experiments exist (instead of pure data collection); to make sure the causes we have assumed are correct. To point to a couple of experiments with an unexpected result and then say that all of science has failed isn't even a little bit right.",1324428757

The author claims that things are complicated by the concept of causation.<p>He cites David Hume: ""...causes are a strange kind of knowledge. This was first pointed out by David Hume, the 18th-century Scottish philosopher. Hume realized that, although people talk about causes as if they are real factstangible things that can be discovered -- theyre actually not at all factual. Instead, Hume said, every cause is just a slippery story, a catchy conjecture, a 'lively conception produced by habit.' When an apple falls from a tree, the cause is obvious: gravity. Humes skeptical insight was that we dont see gravity -- we see only an object tugged toward the earth. We look at X and then at Y, and invent a story about what happened in between. We can measure facts, but a cause is not a fact -- its a fiction that helps us make sense of facts.""<p>It's been a while since I've taken philosophy, but Hume's skepticism of causality is itself a story by its own criteria.",1324427951

His son came crying to him one day because his homework wasn't done, so his wife did the child's homework (to ensure that his grades didn't drop as a result of his negligence). 3 months later, both parents were doing ALL of this child's homework, because he'd realized that if he didn't work, someone else would do the work for him. He could sit around playing video games all day (yes, that's exactly what he did) and anything unpleasant or difficult was handled by other people (his parents).<p>That is, until his teacher figured it out. While his homework was always done impeccably, his performance on tests were abysmal. The teacher rightfully berated the parents, and not a moment too soon.<p>A second example comes via an old co-worker of mine who spent a large part of his career under communist rule, but was absolutely disgusted at his co-workers. Everyone did the bare minimum because there was no incentive to perform or excel (everyone got paid the same regardless). And so naturally, anyone aspiring to greatness and having some ambition left for a country where performance was rewarded.<p>You see similar effects in well entrenched union jobs.",1324426298

Nevertheless, more than 40 percent of them were later shown to be either totally wrong or significantly incorrect.""<p>If science was really failing us, I don't see how we would have managed to retract those incorrect studies. It feels like the writer had no bigger point than ""biomedical research is hard, let's go shopping."" It's sensationalist to consider science a failure every time it makes a mistake.<p>I thought the Hume references were pretty bad, too. If you read what he says, he questions the existence of relations such as ""A causes B"" and prefers to phrase them as, ""In the past, we have observed A-like events are always correlated with B-like events."" For practical purposes, that's enough to behave as if causality ""really"" exists. You just have to avoid mixing up causality with mere correlation, which every good scientist already knows.",1324426243

Where you see an = sign you should think ""proportional to"".<p>Suppose we have a magnet at the origin with magnetic moment 1 in the z direction: m = [0,0,1]. The magnet is moving in vertically (in the z direction). Further we have the pipe vertically with radius 1. The problem now is to determine the current through the pipe. Since the problem is symmetrical around the z-axis we can consider just the current though the points r = [1,0,z].<p>The magnetic field due to the dipole is B(r) = 3r(m dot r)/r^5 - m/r^3. The flux through the pipe at r = [1,0,z] is just the x component of the magnetic field, since the pipe is vertical. Plugging in and simplifying we get Phi = 3z/sqrt(1+z^2)^5. Since the magnet is moving in the z direction, lets say z = t, to compute the change in Phi we need to compute dPhi/dz. If we put that into Wolfram Alpha we get a picture like this:<p><a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+x%2Fsqrt%281%2Bx%5E2%29%29%5E5%2C+x%3D-3..3%2Cy%3D-1..2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=d%2Fdx+x%2Fsqrt%281%2Bx...</a><p>As you can see you get a strong current in one direction around the pipe at the middle of the magnets, and two weaker currents in the opposite direction above and below the magnet.<p>This doesn't yet say anything about the case of the slit, but it does at least show that the currents are indeed moving like I sketched for the no slit case in the picture of my other response.",1324425963

2454304,comment,2453873,2453873,7,0,solipsist,,,"Cellular automata, which includes Conway's Game of Life, is impressive because of the complexity that arises from simplicity. Starting from just a few simple rules and starting arrangements, structures can appear that you would never have expected.<p>Some people believe that our universe could be a type of cellular automata itself.<p>There are some interesting connections between our universe and the type of cellular automata like Conway's Game of Life. It is possible to predict events in the future by looking at the big picture. Various levels and hierarchies of structures are formed in Conway's Game of Life (e.g. gliders and glider guns) that seem to obey their own rules. However, these macro rules are nowhere close to the original micro rules of the simulation. While we can look at these macro rules to make certain predictions, the only way we can determine every cell's state in the future is by letting the simulation play out one generation at a time.",1302973135

Microsoft argues that the case for deference is greatly weakened if the USPTO never evaluated the specific prior art in question; but that deference <i>should</i> still be given w.r.t. anything that the USPTO considered.<p>IBM's amicus brief opposes that approach, because they argue it'll create a mess if the standard of review depends on details of a specific patent's administrative record, and because it will encourage patent filers to just dump huge reams of potential prior-art into the USPTO record, to make sure that anything that could possibly be found will count as having been already considered by the USPTO.",1302973099

2454297,comment,2454017,2454261,4,0,gte910h,,,"Let's go into a few points:<p>Costs. My state has the opposite (corps more expensive than LLCs), So this is a YMMV thing.<p>>Why is it a ripoff, reason number 2? When you form an LLC you have to spend lots of time with your lawyer hashing out things like what happens to the company when you die<p>It is almost trivial to change the LLC operating agreement. Sure, once you start to get into it, you can get more complex, but this again, is something you can do easily again later once you're sure you are sticking with this thing.<p>>Why is it a ripoff, reason number 3? The reason your tax guy is telling you it's a good deal is because of the pass through loss/profit which falls through to you<p>Only for 1 of the three ways to do LLCs. You can do LLCs as a disregarded entity (what you're talking about, which is simple as hell, but has a generally higher tax burden). You can elect to treat your LLC as a C-Corp for federal tax purposes (and state). This, for tax purposes, is basically a C corp, with all that matters under the tax law. You can elect to treat your LLC as a S-Corp (what I do). This allows you to do <i>damn near everything</i> you can as an actual S-Corp with oodles more flexibility, generally smaller filing fees,  and a much faster setup with no annual meeting, etc, requirements.<p>>Now for the really big reason: if you make a profit with an LLC, you will pay self-employment tax. If you take profits with an S-corp it is dividend income (or share buybacks, etc).<p>Only if it's a disregarded entity. You do not pay self employment tax with a LLC taking a S-Corp election, you pay active owners a salary(on which you pay SS and medicare) and any other income is reported on schedule K (which does not trigger self employment tax; self employment tax is a stand in for SS and Medicare taxes).<p>> You WILL pay more taxes using an LLC than an S-corp simply because you have far less flexibility owing to the fact that the corp is a separate legal entity while that is an extreme grey area for an LLC.<p>No it's not. LLCs are better statutorily defined than corporations actually. They are quite clearly defined.  Generally speaking, disregarded entities (what you apparently had) are considerably closer to a sole proprietorship than S-Corp and C-Corp elected LLCs. This is why I say ""You should probably be doing a S or C corp LLC"".<p>>Your average CPA is useless when talking about these topics,<p>You need to find a small business CPA. They know tons about this. If you go to an estate planning expert, don't expect tons of tricks in the small business department. CPAs have specialties just like coders do. You wouldn't have your ruby guru write your C microcontroller code. Same deal with accountants. I've been to two small business CPAs who both sung ""S-Corp election of a LCC"" from the top of the highest mountains.",1302973030

Skimming over this page you linked I have again those thought about how the world is filled with so many different customs, people, problems, even sleeping habits.<p>I leave in China right now and these tips look very weird, exotic from here. For example, what do they (ASA) have against a short nap? Here the countryside girls selling vegetables in local markets do nap on their lines of carrots. I bet you they do not have any sleeping problems.<p>They (ASA) say ""When you watch TV or read in bed, you associate the bed with wakefulness"". That's true for most recent TV programs, because they punch you in the face constantly (it has not always been the case), but most books I read do not push me in a ""state during which [I am] conscious and aware of the world."" On the contrary, good reading brings a soft transition between full awareness of the real world and the dreams I'll get during the night. Maybe it is a drug, but I tell you: I always read in bed before sleeping, even if I'm too tired. I just can't climb the couch and sleep right away.

2454268,comment,2450972,2450972,1,0,Ratufa,,,"Good ""dictionaries"" for doing on-line brute-force attacks don't just contain words, they contain likely passwords.  Guidelines for choosing good passwords should point this out.  For example, something like ""J4fS!2"" is a much much more secure password in terms of protection from on-line attacks than ""letmein"" or ""chang3m3"" or ""tryandguessthis"" or ""password123"" or ""root!@#"" or ""b4ckm3upsc077y"".  All of those passwords are actual passwords taken from the list used by an SSH brute-force password cracker.<p>Because people aren't random when they choose words to remember (e.g. ""beavisandbuthead"" is also on that list), a better set of password-choosing directions would provide instructions one how to add some additional (pseudo-)randomness to passwords that are being created.  The classic ""pick a phrase, take the first letters + punctuation"" method is one way to do that (""pap,ttfl+p"" is a somewhat strong password), and it's not hard to think of other password generation schemes that also create strong passwords.",1302972100

Will try to get all of the questions answered in one shot here.<p>Why is it a ripoff?  In my state (IL) it costs $250 annually to keep your LLC in good standing, while it costs $75 a year for an S-Corp.<p>Why is it a ripoff, reason number 2?  When you form an LLC you have to spend lots of time with your lawyer hashing out things like what happens to the company when you die, if you have a partner the complexity of the operating agreement goes up exponentially.  With a corp all of these things are already determined for you by a huge body of corporate law.  With an LLC you are reinventing the wheel. Based on the original question this is a no-brainer for the poster, this alone is a big enough reason to scrap the LLC idea immediately.<p>Why is it a ripoff, reason number 3? The reason your tax guy is telling you it's a good deal is because of the pass through loss/profit which falls through to you. If you dig deep enough you will discover that an LLC really IS you for most purposes, especially if you own 100% of the shares.  It is not a separate legal entity unless you have more than one shareholder (go look it up).<p>As far as complexity, that's bullshit. I would venture that 100% of the people who say this nonsense have no idea what you actually need to do in order to keep a corp in good standing.  Yes, you need to have minutes of your annual meeting, even if it's something as simple as ""the annual meeting was held over lunch and nothing of note was discussed"".  It is not rocket science, it's just scary when you're not familiar with it.<p>Now for the really big reason:  if you make a profit with an LLC, you will pay self-employment tax.  If you take profits with an S-corp it is dividend income (or share buybacks, etc). You WILL pay more taxes using an LLC than an S-corp simply because you have far less flexibility owing to the fact that the corp is a separate legal entity while that is an extreme grey area for an LLC. I strongly suspect this is why people are generally herded towards LLC's, simply because they are easier to track and tax than corps.<p>Your average CPA is useless when talking about these topics, they are used to talking about real estate tax deductions and dependents, not the intricacies of setting up a legal entity with the flexibility to deal with other legal entities, distribute shares, etc.",1302971898

It turns out that there was a hard limit on the number of breakpoints you could have running at once though: 65536.

If a commodity like <i>search</i> can be sticky, why not social media?<p>Secondly, a social networking service is intrinsically harder for users to change, because you are connected to other people. Of course, it has to do its basic job well; you have to keep improving it; you need good PR. In other words, it's your game to lose.<p>I'm not sure why MySpace failed, but I think part of it was targeting teens/young people (who like change, both in adopting the new and in then discarding it), e.g. via bands, which is also hit/fad oriented. I think facebook's uni students are less dangerous in this sense, because they more often want to keep in contact after graduating (compared with teenagers), and facebook have worked hard to grow out of that dangerously fashionable zone anyway.<p>warning: this post contains <i>guesses</i>.",1302969777

In order to do so, you must spend extra years of your life in school.</i><p>That's a naive analysis - given a pool of unknown candidates (e.g a stack of CVs from people unknown to the hiring manager) he or she will obviously look for ""the best"" candidates, and lacking any other indication (e.g. from fresh grads with no work experience) will go for the best qualified. It's not the case that employers are driving up the academic requirements - they are merely responding logically to a more academically qualified pool of candidates.",1302969601

There&#x27;s no &quot;here&#x27;s the minimum you need to do to be PCI Level X compliant&quot;.  The reason is that the industry considers every situation to be different (I doubt most are all that different or if they are, 90% of them can fit into a handful of buckets), and you&#x27;re supposed to hire PCI auditors to come in and certify you.  Another reason there are no minimum guidelines is that PCI seems to be more about awareness than actual specific architecture.  You can sidestep certain things as long as you document them and what your mitigating implementation is.  This leads to...<p>Last time I went through a PCI setup, it was a unspoken spoken rule that if we hired an auditor that didn&#x27;t certify us even though we thought we should be, we could hire a different auditor, and keep doing so until we got one we liked.",1417498885

The publishers listed are also have huge amounts of revenue in textbooks and other book markets (to be fair, another awful scam). It might be better to look at non-profit publishers such as ACS and AAAS, which are also mainly closed-access. For example, AAAS which has Science magazine and a few other journals brought in 48M w/ 42M in expenses [1]. That said, they bring in 11M as well in member dues, which more than anything else gets you subscription to AAAS journals. It&#x27;s harder to tell with ACS, because it also includes revenues for CAS and other services [2].  PLoS, an open access publisher, seems to generally have lower costs based on an author pays model FWIW.<p>[1] pg 50 of <a href=""http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_2013-Annual-Report.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/AAAS_2013-Annual-Rep...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://acswebcontent.acs.org/annualreport/financials_financialsummary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://acswebcontent.acs.org/annualreport/financials_financ...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2013-2014-Progress-Update-financial-page.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plos.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/2013-2014-Pro...</a>",1417498199

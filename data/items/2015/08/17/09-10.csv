It just happened to succeed more widely.<p>I think Unix&#x27;s success is much more about actual practical reasons that mere chance &#x27;happening&#x27; to favour it.<p>Unix wasn&#x27;t at all controlling and limiting in the way Smaltalk was. Unix provided complementary tools in an open environment. If you wanted to, you could write your own tools for Unix from the ground up starting from assembler even. The first thing people did on Unix was port over existing languages and tools such as Fortran from previous systems, and even to this day some of the base math libraries are implemented in Fortran. That sort of thing wasn&#x27;t feasible with Smalltalk.",1439805568

It&#x27;s a fallacy to assume that there must be a positive side. That said, it probably depends on point of view. I&#x27;m sure some people consider greater corporate profits to be a &quot;positive&quot; thing. On the other hand, I view that increased profit that widens the wealth gap as increasing social unrest, a serious &quot;negative&quot;.<p>> What will it give us in return?<p>More &quot;public-private partnership&quot; style corruption?<p>The initial steps of corporate sovereignty at the expense of national sovereignty?<p>Profit for various corporations (leading to a widening of the wealth gap) thanks to easier movement of capital and the overriding of regulations (via the treaty itself and via ISDS later on).<p>In short, even more undermining of national power and the rise of corporatism (or, depending on your definition, fascism).<p>--<p>aside: This is one of the reasons it is stupid to give corporations a pass on things like surveillance (ad tracking, analytics, the windows 10 mess, etc). Far too often people are (rightly) concerned about what the government is doing while ignoring corporations that do the same thing. This becomes a serious problem if the corporations <i>become</i> government (either <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto</i>).",1439805444

I don&#x27;t <i>want</i> a Smalltalk windowing system. I&#x27;ve got one already, thanks.<p>It gets worse when you actually try to write substantial amounts of code; because Smalltalk doesn&#x27;t store source in files, and everything&#x27;s built in to images, you don&#x27;t get to use standard source control workflows. The last time I looked at Smalltalk, it had its own VCS called Monticello. That&#x27;s showstopping, for me. (Although I notice that Monticello seems to have git integration these days.)<p>There are a few command-line Smalltalks around, GNU Smalltalk being the most well-known.

Other wheels will try to forcibly rebalance the user, but again it&#x27;s fairly easy to defeat, not much the wheel can do if you just lean forward despite its best effort… and you eat pavement again.<p>Aside from that, acquaintances who&#x27;ve tried/used them tell me they&#x27;re fairly fast to learn and very enjoyable and convenient.",1439805061

10072090,comment,10071814,10071990,0,0,vidarh,,,"It may be one basket, but IBM high end kit is the nuclear fallout shelter of baskets.<p>E.g. we used to have an IBM Enterprise Storage System (aka the Shark) back in the day (around 2000), and it came in American fridge size, full of drawers of drives. You could just yank any drawer safe in the knowledge that all the raid volumes were distributed over multiple drawers. If a SCSI controller failed, you could yank a drawer of SCSI controllers and hotswap them safe in the knowledge they were fully redundant.<p>The &quot;brains&quot; of the thing consisted of a fully redundant pair of two AIX RS/6000 servers, and you could yank either one of them without losing data (all writes were committed to at least non-volatile memory on both servers before being acknowledged). Either server also had at least hot-swap RAM (raid-like memory controller) and may have had hot swap CPU&#x27;s (tell the OS to move all threads off a CPU, swap, switch back).<p>On top of that, it had a phone connection and would dial out to report any early warnings of problems directly to IBM who&#x27;d send out a technician before anything even failed as long as you kept paying your support plan.<p>So yes, you can get that density with standard kit <i>easily</i>, and probably much cheaper too. Assuming you have enough skilled staff to manage it. The reason IBM still manages to sell this kind of kit, on the other hand, is because what they are really selling is peace of mind that most issues are Someone Elses Problem.

10072087,comment,10069748,10071670,0,0,chipsy,,,"I used Leo for a solo game project - AS3 code - made over the course of about a year. I also took some notes with it during the same time. It was over five years ago now. I don&#x27;t remember all the details of what I did, but:<p>First of all, there were some encoding conflicts that were introduced when mixing Leo with other editors. When I go back to the project now, it doesn&#x27;t compile because of the encoding errors. (It&#x27;s fixable, I&#x27;m sure.)<p>Second, I had more classes than I needed. The secret to writing compact game code is - basically - to write few real classes and rely on plain old data and a large main loop. As it was, they were calling up and down some hierarchy, splitting pieces of the main loop into different classes, running a custom scripting language to drive AI, etc. I had all sorts of ill-considered ideas at the time and no real guidance. It wasn&#x27;t a _tremendous_ amount of code(running a simple count again, 31,145 LOC with whitespace/comments and 22,372 without), and Leo documented what it all did, but the tool couldn&#x27;t suggest why it was fundamentally rotten, it just added process on top. By the end I wasn&#x27;t really using Leo, because it wasn&#x27;t solving my problems.<p>Looking back on it now, I have a style that can more naturally accommodate a literary programming approach because I&#x27;m more likely to write a straight-line solution first. But I would not rely on an external tool again as I don&#x27;t want the dependency.",1439804861

For example, I was reading Simon Marlow&#x27;s book and while trying to compile the examples in a Windows machine, a particular library could not be installed because of the lack of &#x27;configure&#x27; (GNU autotools? I only use Windows nowadays due to professional reasons and have not used GNU/Linux last 11 years). I hope that library authors do not make such assumptions unless it really necessary.<p>Is there an opportunity for a company to create an implementation of Haskell which fixes some commonly mentioned problems (e.g. stop the world GC) - like proprietary JVM vendors? Is it even technically feasible? Of course, such a hypothetical company would also need to spend a lot of time writing useful libraries.",1439804276

Natural selection operating on the level of entire universes. Several different theories postulate singularities as a source of new universes, which in turn means that a universe in which conditions allow for significant gravitationally-bound accumulations of matter will have more &quot;offspring&quot; than a universe in which they don&#x27;t. Thus, physical constants which are conducive to life are likely to be more common than otherwise expected, simply because (coincidentally) those conditions are the ones which give rise to significant gravitationally-bound accumulations of matter.<p>2. Arguments in favor of simulated universes. Paul Davies (if you want a name to look up) has a few layman-accessible articles arguing about the probability of this, and working from the fact you only need one life-supporting universe -- which is likely given various of the multi-universe theories -- to kickstart the process and wind up with a far larger number of life-supporting simulated ones.<p>There are also people who make arguments in favor of a more traditional religious conception of &quot;God&quot;, but do so from the standpoint of regularities in physical law. Those are less interesting to me personally for a few reasons, but they are out there.",1439804190

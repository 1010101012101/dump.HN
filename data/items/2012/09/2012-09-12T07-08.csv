4509624,comment,4508614,4508614,12,0,masklinn,,,"> Specify the /usr/local Prefix in Scripts<p>> When writing scripts, specify the full path to the executable youve installed in the first line of the script.<p>No. Don't do that. Bad. Even for maintenance and admin scripts, that makes them severely less portable and harder to keep in sync across machines for various reasons. Your path is setup correctly, just use that: there are very few reasons for your shebang lines to be anything other than:<p><pre><code>    #!/usr/bin/env $executable ""$options""
</code></pre>
This will make the shebang work using the normal rules of path-resolution, and means path-override tools and methods (e.g. python virtual environments, or `PATH=$somedirectory ./script`) will work correctly.<p>edit: I am told not all versions of shebang/`env` support passing options to the $executable, and most notably it doesn't work on Linux. So don't do that, and i won't in the future. Still, $executable is usually sufficient",1347436682

For example suppose you have two features x1 and x2, you can add higher order features like x1<i>x2 or x1^2 or x2^2 or a combination of these. While doing linear regression you treat these terms as individual features so x1</i>x2 is a feature say x3. This way you can fit non-linear data with a non-linear curve. However there is a problem of overfitting, i.e your curve may try to be too greedy and fit the data perfectly, but that's not what you want.

Ability to query data in batch [in addition to live] mode. Mode shall be transparently managed by application code. Example: my dataset is too big, I am fine with delays, I run data processing [aggregation, etc] as a scheduled task during nightly maintenance window.<p>2. Ability to define aggregation schema that can be saved as schema in the database. This is very useful for the following use case: I know my typical aggregation pattern, so I define it in the database schema, I schedule a batch processing task, which aggregates data according to the already defined db schema and saves the results into the database. When I need to query data later on, I can use already pre-computed data instead of live query each time. This feature is very important from ease of use perspective, the ease of use is coming from db handling this instead of application.<p>3.

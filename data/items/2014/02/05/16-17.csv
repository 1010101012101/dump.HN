For most people in this situation, the laws on the books already took care of the problem. If she already had healthcare insurance at her previous employer, if she could show continuous coverage, she would be able to continue to purchase healthcare insurance privately, despite her preexisting condition.<p>Whether the private insurance would be affordable to you is a different question, but it&#x27;s not true that a preexisting condition was, before Obamacare, a complete roadblock to acquiring coverage privately.",1391619594

For example, I use Apple gear for my home computer / phone / tablet (although I have a custom AOSP tablet for work - we flash our own firmware for it though, so it&#x27;s not really google-y).  I use Google for maybe 5% of my searches, I only use GMail for work, and quite frankly we could switch at a moment&#x27;s notice to another email solution), and I only use Google Maps when I want to look at a map on my work PC, which runs linux.<p>Apart from the 5% of search that I find I need Google for, the rest is very easy to switch out.  Compare that to the world of computing in the 90s.  Your computer needed to be able to read FAT32.  Your web site needed to work well for IE.  There was only one valid office suite out there.  Most peripherals only came with Windows drivers, shutting everyone else out of the fun. Indeed one part of the rebirth of the Mac was the recognition that peripheral driver support would have to be done in-house, rather than relying on 3rd parties to provide Mac drivers for their products.<p>The Microsoft dominance of the 90s made computing on competing platforms difficult. Google does not have anything like that level of domination / lock-in.",1391619468

Climate change/environmental damage. This won&#x27;t kill us all, I think, but could majorly lower our quality of life.\n2. Overpopulation/mass migrations. Nigeria&#x27;s population is predicted to be over a billion by the end of this century - an 8-fold increase. India&#x27;s population growth isn&#x27;t slowing down either. It does look as though humanity&#x27;s population will peak at around 9/10 billion - but this will be predominantly within the most unstable regimes. Expect mass movement of refuges, further destabilising governments in advanced economies, fuelling further growth in mass surveillance, etc.\n3. The singularity. This one <i>could</i> kill us all.

We&#x27;ve decided on this because:<p>>The print version of Two Scoops of Django 1.5 has been by far the most popular version of the book with readers, selling several times more than the e-books. In addition, the feedback we&#x27;ve gotten has been that technical books are generally better to have in print than as an ebook.<p>>Creating and proofing each ebook format is not a trivial effort. It involves reformatting every code sample to work on every ebook reader, accounting for differences in screen contrast, accessibility testing, and proofreading the text and code samples several times on each device. Instead of spending our time struggling with reformatting, we&#x27;re choosing to focus on improving the technical material.<p>>Considering that we publicly offered a free electronic copy to those who requested it, seeing piracy of the electronic editions from the first day of sales has been disheartening. As indie authors, it hurts to see this happening.<p>Now I don&#x27;t agree with those reasons. I prefer an ebook version as I can bookmark it, make notes, read it on my phone etc. But they have their reasons. It&#x27;s not going to stop piracy and I might purchase the paper copy and then download one of the pirate versions that will come out. I would prefer they offered a free ebook version that they didn&#x27;t spend time fixing the code layout issues they mention.

It involves your parents. And they already had a nationality too. You couldn&#x27;t have been born by any two random other people and still be the same person (DNA, childhood raising, education, food, native language, et al).<p>Second, you is not your birth only. It&#x27;s also your upbringing, the culture you grew up in, the state/legal/etc environment you were raise, the language you spoke, the cuisine you were raised with, heck, even the national TV channels you were watching while growing up.<p>Would anybody dare to say the same thing to a black person? Nah, your culture and stuff is nothing, you could just as well be white? He&#x27;d be totally right to tell you to fuck off, for he has lived his culture (including bad treatment by white folks) all his life -- he knows that he being black wasn&#x27;t just some &quot;accident of birth&quot;, but an identity. Even a kid grewing up in Brooklyn by European Jews owes a lot to both Brooklyn and to him descending from European Jews (just ask Woody Allen).<p>It&#x27;s also a potentially harmful way to see things. It&#x27;s basically just an excuse to feel independent and non-connected and owning solidarity to anyone. Home country in danger? &quot;Fuck it, I&#x27;ll just flee. After all, it&#x27;s only me, me, me that matters&quot;.<p>(You can feel solidarity for other nationalities and countries while also feeling pride and solidarity for your own people. Feeling solidarity for other people when you don&#x27;t even care about your own is a little more difficult, despite those people paying lip service to &quot;we&#x27;re all one&quot;).",1391617740

JFK, who initially got the whole ball rolling, actually wanted nothing to do with space exploration. His backing of it was really just a political ploy.

7184470,comment,7183682,7184341,3,0,padseeker,,,"I was thinking a lot simpler - keep tabs on each ISP in each market. Determine who has the least discriminatory network. Once enough data is collected you can make recommendations. ISP X is the best, ISP Y is the worst, anyone who cares needs to switch from ISP Y to ISP X. No bitcoin needed.<p>You can have a coordinated event, a cancellation day where all users of ISP Y cancel on the same day and switch to ISP X. Make a big deal about it. Tell your friends about it.<p>The one concern I have is in certain markets there might not be enough competition. If all the providers in that market are throttling then you have a stronger case for the government to get involved. Heck, there might even be collusion in those markets. But you might be able to bypass any government enforcement of Net Neutrality if there are enough well informed consumers punishing the bad ISPs and patronizing the good ISPs. It aint rocket science.",1391616059

If Pydanny or Audrey stops by to read this, I have a suggestion.<p>You two should write a book aimed at someone entirely new to Django. I&#x27;ve seen your book often recommended as the second book on Django you should read. However, there isn&#x27;t a good first book that isn&#x27;t very outdated.  How about &quot;One Scoop of Django&quot;, as an intro for someone brand new to Django? Perhaps more example based, but still with your fun style. Or you could expand your current book with some new chapters.<p>Thanks!",1391616030

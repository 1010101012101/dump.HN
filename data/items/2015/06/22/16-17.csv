9759624,comment,9758625,9759578,0,0,linkregister,,,"My opinion is divided about the &quot;pay-to-play&quot; model of workers paying for their own training.  On one hand, they assume all the risk and financial hardship of training.  On the other hand, compared to other developed economies (British, Australian), they have more opportunities to change careers because the risk of training has already been assumed by the worker.  I&#x27;ve found that American hiring is far more flexible than the Commonwealth tradition of jockeying for an apprenticeship.  And older workers have far less opportunity for apprenticeships.<p>It&#x27;s hard to defend the code schools though.  There are a high amount of horror stories we hear about them on HN, from both the students&#x27; and hiring managers&#x27; perspectives.",1434992347

9759620,comment,9758454,9759469,0,0,Nacraile,,,"> CS graduates from MIT and Stanford could be expected to justify hours of their time in &quot;Scrum ceremonies&quot; (which means that they aren&#x27;t trusted, which means that their credentialing institutions and work experiences aren&#x27;t trusted). Even average programmers in the bowels of Fortune 500&#x27;s IT organizations had more autonomy than the typical &quot;Agile&quot; programmer today.<p>If that&#x27;s been your experience with Agile, you&#x27;ve have the misfortune of seeing Agile done horribly wrong in a patholgically unhealthy workplace.  You may also be romanticizing a bit about old school way of doing things (I have a co-worker who used to work at a major jet engine manufacturer.  They were expected to be sitting at their desks when the bell (literally!) rang at 8:30 am.  They were expected to wait for the bell to ring break time in before they went to the washroom.  As a programmer!  Scrum ceremonies aren&#x27;t sounding so bad).<p>Seriously, stand-up isn&#x27;t supposed to be about accounting for your time, and it isn&#x27;t supposed to be a vehicle for top-down micro-management.  If it&#x27;s either of these things for you, the problem is your organization, not your specific process.<p>In my (very positive) experience, stand-up is about maintaining situational awareness in the team.  It&#x27;s a well defined point for people to raise general questions if they&#x27;ve run into ambiguity, or cast a wide net if they&#x27;ve run into impediment.  To-do lists are de-emphasized; it&#x27;s an opportunity to pick the collective brain and gain some clarity / help with what you&#x27;re doing.",1434992296

9759608,comment,9757395,9757706,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"> One of the design goals in Ceylon was to treat all these things uniformly, so that a class is, as much as possible, just like any other function.<p>That&#x27;s reassuring to know, thanks :)<p>> However, there is a big and surprisingly important difference between a class and a function that returns a record: with a class you get open recursion between members of the class.<p>Record members are certainly bound too early to get open recursion, which is why I claimed that classes == functions rather than objects == records ;)<p>In my example of Python, &quot;objects&quot; are abstract: created implicitly, passed into the constructor, then (implicitly) returned.<p>> You don&#x27;t get that with a function that assigns members to a record type - or, at least, if you do build the machinery you need to get that, you have essentially reinvented classes with a worse syntax.<p>I think there are a few distinctions to be made here:<p>- Records vs. objects; which I&#x27;ve addressed above.<p>- Syntax vs. semantics: I&#x27;m fine with special-purpose syntax, I just don&#x27;t like arbitrary <i>semantic</i> distinctions. It sounds like Ceylon is better than most in this regard :)<p>- Built-in vs. library code: reinventing classes using functions is only a bad idea if they&#x27;re already built into the language in some other way. If there&#x27;s no built-in alternative, then doing this in a library is legitimate. Likewise, using the language&#x27;s existing support for functions to build-in a class implementation is also legitimate, and it sounds like that&#x27;s what Ceylon&#x27;s done :)",1434992166

These constraints were pretty much sufficient to fully determine the resulting design.<p>Furthermore, there was an issue open in Ceylon&#x27;s issue tracker for almost 2 years, following on from discussions and proposals in two other issues that go back even further, and these issues were read and commented on by many of our community members, including some who have some Scala experience.<p>Now, if you could point to some cool idea in Scala that we obviously aren&#x27;t aware of, and which could have improved the design of constructors in Ceylon, then I guess you would have a point.

Since I worked on an IBM filmless radiology system for the US military hospitals (DIN-PACS) in the late 90s, I wondered about the current state of the art in computer-assisted radiology.  Turns out IBM Watson and other AI techniques are preparing to solve the fatigue problem of human radiologists reading thousands of images a day.  Just like military radar operators got lots of automated assistance, radiologists will soon be backed up by automated systems.  Humans are poor at estimating an exponential rate of change.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3033422"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3033422</a>",1434991204

You go from a state where people spawn with the &quot;bozo bit&quot; off to one where they spawn with it on. You get a completely different political dynamic when that happens.<p>Obviously, trust has varying degrees and context. In Japan, you can leave your laptop at a cafe; in the U.S., you probably wouldn&#x27;t. That doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;re &quot;low trust&quot; or trust-sparse. We might generally trust most people to be decent while aware of the ~0.05% (?) chance per person (that someone steals the computer.<p>What is changing is trust with regard to competence. People were never so foolish as to trust all others without limits, but there used to be an assumption of competence in the professional world. Institutions like universities are less trusted, and so are people in general when it comes to basic competence and readiness for autonomy. It would be unthinkable, 20 years ago, that CS graduates from MIT and Stanford could be expected to justify hours of their time in &quot;Scrum ceremonies&quot; (which means that they aren&#x27;t trusted, which means that their credentialing institutions and work experiences aren&#x27;t trusted). Even average programmers in the bowels of Fortune 500&#x27;s IT organizations had more autonomy than the typical &quot;Agile&quot; programmer today.<p>Right now we are in an era of organizational decline. It&#x27;s not necessarily catastrophic; it might not even be bad. What it does mean is that institutions (universities, professional organizations, corporations, and even unions) have lost their role as central brokers of trust. It raises interesting questions. Thus far, most of the successful startups have been beneficiaries of institutional decline (and, again, some of those institutions <i>deserved</i> to break down, so I&#x27;m not moralizing) and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any economic reward to build institutions (as opposed to mere corporations, smaller in scope) up... so it doesn&#x27;t happen.",1434991047

Then all of a sudden we run smack into something like this big wall of WFT:<p><pre><code>  * The infix application function (ma>>=\a->f(a)), commonly called bind, executes the computation ma to expose its effects, calling the resulting value a, and passes that to function f. Evidently, the result of this application (f a) should again be a potentially side-effecting computation; hence, the type signature for bind looks like this:\n\n  (>>=):: M a -> (a -> M b) -> M b.\n\n  * The injection function (return a) injects a pure value into a computation. Its type signature is: return :: a -> M a.\n\n  In practice, each effect usually comes with so-called nonproper morphisms. These domain-specific operations are unique to that effect ...\n</code></pre>\nSeriously, how can I hack around and understand this?",1434990705

9759422,comment,9756213,9758325,0,0,pluma,,,"I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re fundamentally in disagreement, but I object the notion that people raised in Western countries wouldn&#x27;t behave like the &quot;clients&quot; in the article do. &quot;Culture&quot; isn&#x27;t as simple as that -- social norms differ widely within Western cultures and even at the regional or family level. Based on older stories about human trafficking, a lot of &quot;patrons&quot; hail from countries we would consider better than that, and many of them are middle-class or even upper-class, so it&#x27;s not just a matter of social status either.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s difficult to change someone&#x27;s behaviour by talking at them. The only reliable long-term change in behaviour can be brought about during childhood. Just consider religion: sure, there are adult converts, but a fraction of adults converts from the religion they were raised in to another. A person&#x27;s religion (and religiosity) is mostly an artefact of how and where they grew up.<p>> Human trafficking and slavery are wrong because they are wrong, because they are evil.<p>Evil is an intuitive but ultimately ineffective concept. These behaviours are harmful both to the individual and to society at large. They unilaterally violate the personal liberty and human rights of the victim. That&#x27;s why we consider them evil, not the other way around.<p>I&#x27;m defining natural in terms of animal behaviour because it&#x27;s the closest we can get in order to draw conclusions about how humans would behave in the absence of ethics and a functioning society. Rape and murder in cold blood are what we see in extreme situations where society has effectively collapsed (e.g. during war, starvation or epidemics).<p>There&#x27;s a reason we say people act like animals in these situations: it&#x27;s because they do. Starvation, anxiety, duress, etc, they all impact a person&#x27;s capability of rational thought and lead to people following their most basic instincts. Many people still act &quot;human&quot; in these situations, but in general, you&#x27;re going to see far more horrific behaviour than otherwise (especially if &quot;one thing leads to another&quot;, e.g. because of group dynamics).<p>Also, if we understand that slavery is wrong not just because it is evil, but because it is demonstrably incompatible with a notion of right and wrong based on minimizing human suffering while maximum personal liberty, it is obvious why it is objectionable to tolerate cultures that consider this behaviour acceptable.<p>In other words, aside from the ethically neutral aspects of a culture (e.g. creation myths, funny hats and silly rituals), one culture <i>can</i> be objectively better or worse than another.<p>Of course changing worse cultures for the better is a long and time-consuming process. The recent failures in the Middle East and the Arab world are good examples of why you can&#x27;t just invade a place and force the inhabitants to adopt modern values.<p>But teaching someone to be a good person is much easier when they&#x27;re well-fed and don&#x27;t have to fear for their life, health or fortune.<p>(For the record, this isn&#x27;t about Islam or Christianity or even any religion at all -- any culture that perpetuates harmful values has to change, whether those values are based on religion, tradition or mere lack of consideration; religions just tend to get more offended when you try to tell them they are wrong.)",1434990661

You really don&#x27;t think that this would cause an increase in trafficking? If an attempt at legalization with measures to curb trafficking didn&#x27;t work, how would literally letting pimps operate with impunity be a better solution?<p>Here&#x27;s a paper with some links to how decrim has worked in Auckland: <a href=""http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/Report%20on%20NZ%2010-29-2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.prostitutionresearch.com/Report%20on%20NZ%2010-29...</a><p>As we&#x27;ve reached the nested reply limit here: It would let pimps operate with impunity because the service which they are having others sell is no longer an issue? While not all sex workers are trafficked, even those who are not trafficked have pimps. The WHISPER study from the late 80&#x27;s said that almost 90% of women interviewed had pimps during their time in prostitution. Full decriminalization by it&#x27;s very nature makes pimping legal -- that&#x27;s one of its tenants. If you think there is going to be a shortage of abusive/exploitative people waiting in line for that opportunity, we live in very different worlds.<p>Also, the Nordic model gets around that by only criminalizing the sex-work for the person buying it. When arrests are made, the prostitute is asked if they would like assistance with leaving the industry, if they answer no then they are free to go.<p>@abandonliberty\nI would argue that it shows that given what we currently know, the Nordic model of decriminalization for sex workers and criminalization of sex buyers seems to be the most effective at reducing the harms of prostitution. Seeing as both street prostitution, which is dangerous, and human trafficking have been on the decline since it&#x27;s implementation, and the results have not been the same in other countries in which legalization/decrim have been attempted, it&#x27;s the prudent course of action.",1434990351

This guy&#x27;s comment was pretty enlightening:<p>&quot;I was losing money in Detroit. It took me six weeks to learn why.<p>For starters there aren&#x27;t surges in my area like some other markets. So watch your market for surges as that seems to be THE game changer.<p>Also just because there&#x27;s a surge on your app doesn&#x27;t mean you will get a surge fare. Surges can be fleeting and no one here seems to recommend chasing a surge. And pax learn to wait them out or drop location pins outside the surge map.<p>Then the gravy &#x27;airport&#x27; runs carry risk if your market&#x27;s airport requires chauffeur license, commercial plate, & commercial insurance. In Detroit you risk tickets and your car impound. Uber supposedly pays the tickets & impound but my time is valuable too. So I can&#x27;t risk having a bad day at the airport. Then there&#x27;s your rate per mile.<p>Here UBERX is .75cents a mile when you have a pax on a trip. No .75cents for dead miles to and from a trip. After you wash your car and increased maintenance and figure depreciation on your car with the new added mileage it was a losing proposition for me. I got lucky and found UPFN early.<p>Many do this much much longer before understanding all financial consequences. I still am not sure about tax consequences. It appears Uber drivers 1099 will also include the SRF which is money that drivers never touch. You can write it off your income tax but does it affect a driver&#x27;s social security tax? I don&#x27;t have that answer but drivers should really know tax strategies in advance also.<p>This isn&#x27;t even all the answers. This is just a brief snapshot of why I lost money driving for Uber. Some UberPeople seem to be profitable in the right markets with the right vehicle/platform & with surges. You really just need to have a crystal clear picture of your costs, time invested and potential income. Good Luck. :)&quot;",1434990145

They want a 1/4 inch hole.&quot;<p>It reframes the discussion away from features to customer objectives.<p>As you look at your platform, think about different market niches and the things they&#x27;re trying to get done. Here are three tests to apply as you consider a given niche.<p>1. Is it an actual JTBD for a large enough target niche?<p>This is the most basic test. Do people actually have the need that your product/service addresses? Not only that, but can you characterize the the number of potential customers with the JTBD?<p>2. Does your product/service/idea meaningfully improve on the incumbent solution(s)?<p>This is a tougher test. How does your idea outperform the current way customers address the JTBD? You need to have a clear view on this. And the improvement needs to be significant, not just a little. Customers will overvalue their incumbent solution&#x27;s benefits, and undervalue the new product&#x27;s benefits.<p>3. Is the total incremental cost <i>to the customer</i> of your idea less than the total incremental value to the customer?<p>This test is the toughest. You need to consider monetary costs of course. But there can be many other switching costs as well. Loss of existing data, new time required to learn, new formats that have upstream and downstream impacts.<p>My take is that successful products can get to clear yes&#x27;s on these three tests.

9759243,comment,9756203,9756421,0,0,chubot,,,"Hm so when I am writing web servers, I typically have a bash script that simply does curl on a bunch of URLs.  I just run it by hand and make sure it stops on the last failure with &#x27;set -o errexit&#x27;.  I divide it up into bash functions so I can run the set of tests I want, and then string them all together with a top level function.<p>It&#x27;s ultra-minimal, but that is the point.  My job is to deliver working software (relatively quickly), not necessarily beautiful tests.<p>And I actually should say I do &quot;system tests&quot; in bash, not necessarily unit tests.  But I START with system tests.  My workflow is now like this:<p><pre><code>    - write SYSTEM tests in bash first.  This helps me plan what I want to get working.\n    - write the code (It&#x27;s like TDD but with system tests)\n    - sometimes there is some complicated logic I need to test.  Then I switch to unit tests in Python, JS, R, C++, etc.\n    - when I fix bugs later, I tend to reproduce it with a system test.  This makes bug fixing easy.  Then I write a unit test to zero in on the broken part, and sure it never comes back.\n</code></pre>\nI probably save 70% lines of test code, while delivering the same level of quality.  A system test can be fast and can substitute for a lot of unit tests, and it helps you not ossify your code structure too early.<p>I don&#x27;t have an example of that online, but you can see 880 lines of shell in the root dir here: <a href=""https://github.com/google/rappor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/rappor</a><p>Granted, this is more like scientific / batch code than web / backend stuff, but I assure you I follow the same strategy in the latter case.  It&#x27;s basically using Unix as leverage.<p>One thing I would notice about the scripts is how the last line is &quot;$@&quot;.  That runs the function $0 with the args $1 ... $9.  This is a very handy trick that helps keep everything modular and independently executable.<p>I use shell scripts for all these things:<p><pre><code>    - building code (in C, JS, Python, or any language)\n    - testing code (running unit tests in multiple languages, and also system tests, constructing test data)      \n    - deploying code\n    - sys admin; setting up servers (e.g. setup.sh in the repo), backup, managing log files\n    - building docs; making static web sites   \n    - building config files and data files (e.g. lists of URLs)\n\n</code></pre>\nMy assertion is that, combined, these things take up MORE time than actually writing code!  If you can speed them up, you will be more productive at &quot;coding&quot; overall.<p>In addition, using the same tool (bash) for all of them makes you more productive (once you have climbed the admittedly substantial learning curve).  I&#x27;m not a fan of all these language-specific build tools now.  I don&#x27;t even use make that much; my first choice is bash!<p>Here is one concrete example of shell minimalism, which helps you get things done faster.  Think about the common situation of having a {star}_test.py files in many directories, and you want to run them all together as a test suite.<p>I am embarrassed to say that at one point I spent 2 or 3 days researching and implementing some kind of Python test runner (this was over 10 years ago).  I think people do it now with &quot;nose&quot; or something.<p>Here is my preferred solution:<p>find . -name {star}_test.py | sh -x -e<p>Or if you need parallelism, something like:<p>find . -name {star}_test.py | xargs --verbose -n 1 -P 10 -- sh -c<p>({star} should be asterisk; HN is not letting me escape those)<p>That&#x27;s it.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily give you pretty output, but it&#x27;s what you need to deliver working software.  Add one line to a bash script and be done with it, rather than getting distracted by yak shaving.<p>The shell scripts may not look that impressive until you think about what they actually save -- what common alternatives are.  One line CAN actually save you 2 or 3 days of time; this is not the only time I&#x27;ve experienced this.<p>The overall point is that I used to spend a lot of time on tooling and automation (yak shaving), because I wanted a certain level of code quality and iteration speed.  But now I do most of those things with a small, sharp tool -- bash -- and I find it saves a lot of time.  I get in the zone and don&#x27;t get distracted from the main task.",1434989069

Developers' attitude toward dependencies gets very lax when it's too much work to declare them or too much work for the user to satisfy them.  Then you get into situations where you install a piece of software and 90% of the functionality is broken, because the developer was ""considerate"" enough not to ""force"" a bunch of dependencies on you, so you resort to Google to find the real dependencies, which of course aren't available for your distro.  Apt gives developers a flexible way to declare different kinds of dependencies, and the Debian and Ubuntu distro repositories give them confidence that the dependencies will install smoothly for users.<p>I had much more difficulty with undeclared dependencies back in the day than I have with excessive dependencies now.  It's just wrong for software to easily install in a mostly broken state.  If you want broken, partly-working software, you should have to do extra work to achieve that, not the other way around.",1286041993

It doesn't really matter if there is existing competition - you just need to do it 50% better to be a success.  Who knows, you might be part way into the project and realize that there is a truly killer idea for a new audience.  Keep an open mind and <i>do</i> something.<p>Here's a good idea as an example:<p><a href=""http://www.lifesta.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lifesta.com/</a><p>The folks who created this site were likely impressed with Groupon and asked themselves, ""what happens if I don't use this coupon that I'm going to impulse buy?""  Open to ideas while using the service, they created a marketplace not just for Groupons, but that could be used across all of the groupon clones.  With some good press and improved functionality / polish, a good idea will go to great.<p>Beyond erroneously telling you to ""do"" things with an open mind, here are 2 things that I do when I'm looking for new ideas:<p>1) I disconnect completely from technology, change my scenery and think without distraction.  Getting into a pattern is the key for this to work.  I usually book off Tuesday and Thursday afternoons when I'm in idea mode and no matter what else is going on, I disconnect, go for a hike and relax while brainstorming.  Often, I'll toss a digital audio recorder in my pocket so that I can spit out ideas without writing - but nothing else.<p>2) When I'm trying to think of ideas, I talk to people.  Go to local geek meetups / conferences and use the room as a sounding board.  While it's not incredibly honest, I find that confidently telling people that I'm already the CEO of my new project idea, judging their reaction and listening to their feedback / questions is a lot more valuable then a conversation based around the sentence ""what do you think about this idea"".<p>I hope that these things help you out.",1286041980

There is certainly something suboptimal about a government that can't pass a bill smaller than the size of a dictionary, or that in theory and practice protects concentrated interests at the expense of the broader good. I have my doubts that the American state is in a sustainable equilibrium given the astounding irrationality and paralysis of the legislative process.<p>On specialist websites, people might be familiar with the existence of an entire sub-discipline of economics dedicated to explaining the incentives facing voters and governments (Public Choice) and the historical lessons of hundreds of different governing forms in human history, so the discussion thankfully extends beyond Churchill's quote.",1286041788

Do the flickr mashup if you want the experience.<p>A ""Startup Idea"" involves not just a feature, but something that is compelling enough to be a business. You should be in a position where you have more ideas than you can possibly do (this is my position- I get a new business idea every day, at least and a good one every week.)<p>So, I may not be able to relate to not being able to come up with ideas, but I would suggest if you're having trouble to think about the things that you see online and in the world, where there are problems, or inefficiencies that you can improve on.  Great ideas are ones where it is a no-brainer to your customers and where what you're supplying them can be supplied at a very low cost relative to the value they are willing to pay for.   Do try to look for things that are worth paying for- this sets the bar high enough, and means that you have something that can grow by itself without outside investment.  IF you do get outside investment, a profitable business, is going to get better terms than one that bears higher risk.<p>Possibly more experience with engineering will help because it will help you identify areas where software can make peoples lives better.....<p>But do read a lot.  Read entrepreneur books and blogs and understand that it will take awhile before you find the right idea and that it will take a lot of thinking about the possibilities of various ideas to understand what makes a good business for you to do.

1750898,comment,1750534,1750534,0,0,tel,,,"This is somewhat tangential to what you're looking for, but I often get a lot of questions in classes about why I'm never, ever taking notes. It's firstly not quite true and secondly something sometimes difficult for people to understand.<p>I think what people often use notes for is as a surrogate memory. There's a desire to search through them for that one gem which will trigger you to remember all that you once knew. Or worse, it's a search for that part where you can just relive whatever experience you thought should have taught you it the first time, but didn't. To this end we have organizers and smart pens and the like. I might be jaded but they all seem like so many fancy gadgets that all seek to solve a very orthogonal problem.<p>I disagree with the ""note taking habit"" greatly because I think it's in your best interest to learn instead of memorize. By which I mean that if you're truly studying something, the goal must be to enact some sort of change in parts of your life far beyond just what you can regurgitate. It's starkly contradictory to a lot of what everyone seems to practice in education, and my adherence to it has cost me in graded performance, but it's also placed me far above a lot of my peers in both comprehension and success.<p>My goal when learning is building my own, real mind maps. Every thing I ingest has to be processed, extended, applied, and connected to other things. You have to act, not just listen and listen more than notate.<p>In classes that translates to a lot of questions that go beyond the scope of the material and great conversations with professors (in our own time). In information consumption, it translates to a much slower rate of consumption (helped by a lot of filtration) where action items are not just stored up but actively performed while things are still fresh and exciting.<p>In short, I try to maintain a distaste for what you might call ""consumption mode flow"". Learning is atomic and it takes effort to decompartmentalize the things you read into real effects in your life. That decompartmentalization is the best notation method possible, though. If you want to remember something important, make sure it rubs up against everything you do every day. If it's not so important, why write it down?<p>(Also, for voting purposes, <i>pen</i> and paper is best. I find this style of thought is aided by not being able to erase.)",1286041281

My suggestion is send your friends some contact info, like email address and or phone number (depending on whether they are really friends) and let them know you're shutting down your facebook account.  Don't really need to give any explanation, just say you're closing it down.  If pressed, maybe just say it is a distraction, or whatever.<p>Facebook won't actually close your account, though.  That's the hard part.  You have to go thru and delete all your information manually. IF you look on your feed / wall, you can see everything you've done, and you can go and click on it, and delete it.  It is a long slow tedious process, and it takes me about 2 hours to do a year.<p>The normal ""cancel my facebook account"" procedure that facebook does is to just suspend your account. IT is all there and if you ever log in again, it comes right back.  While it is suspended you won't show up on your friends lists, etc, but all your activity is still there.<p>This makes it really easy & tempting--in the days where just about every webpage has a facebook like button that if you accidentally press will cause you to see the facebook login screen-- to bring your account back.<p>I went around and around with them over a year ago about this, and their policy is that there is no such thing as ""canceling"" a facebook account. They keep it ready and waiting for you ""for when you want to come back.""  Thus they will only allow you to ""suspend"" it. (this policy may have changed given all the high profile facebook quitting in the last year.)<p>I'm deleting all of the info, when that is done, I'm going to change the real name on the account to asdsrqwer sadfvcawer and then the password to something random and then ""Suspend it"".",1286041151

The ownership of CC data is an important topic and many providers talk about the importance of this. Three things to consider<p>1) How often will you actually change gateways? I can tell that we have had the same gateway account for 7 years and processing millions of dollars a year and changed merchant accounts many times. The gateway industry is pretty much a commodity, very little price change, no difference between gateways so there is not much value in changing. There are reasons you might change merchant accounts as rates do change and volume can make a difference.<p>2) How to change. If you really do need to change gateways and keep in mind Authorize.net is not going out of business so that is not a consideration, think about the right way to do it. I would either slowly move accounts over as operations like CC updates happened or run multiple gateway accounts to diversify risk.<p>3) Where is the risk? The largest gateways are not going anywhere so your real risk with not doing billing on your own is the billing provider. And yes I am saying this and I am a co-founder at Chargify. Would you prefer to have your CC details held there or at a gateway where you can always access the token to make future charges? This gives you the ability to move billing providers compared with getting locked in.<p>At Chargify we take security very serious and have reviewed all of the different reasons around this topic and can tell you that today all CCs are stored at the gateway but in the future we will have an option that gives YOU the choice where to store this data and how.",1286039848

1750825,comment,1750604,1750670,0,0,mindslight,,,"> <i>Caplan, however, emphasizes that democratic failure does exist and places the blame for it squarely on the general public. He makes special emphasis that politicians are often caught between a rock and a hard place: thanks to advisors, they know what policies would be generally beneficial, but they also know that those policies are not what people want</i><p>These three sources of failure (voters, politicians, lobbyists) don't have to be mutually exclusive. I'd say they're all broken, with the real problem resting in the idea that government is upwardly scalable. The inability of most people to understand actions and motivations other than their own (a requisite for computer security) leads them to thinking that affecting larger groups somehow solves more people's problems (while in fact the opposite is true).",1286039227

Pandora has 80K artists represented (all data from Wikipedia, I&#x27;m lazy :) so if they spent 1% of those 10 dollars/month - or $15M -  on paying the artists, each one would get 187K/month. So if everybody paid $10/month, this should be more than enough to get all access you want to all music - I can&#x27;t believe any artist would not agree to give access to all their music for 100K/month.<p>Of course, not nearly everybody pays $10/month - actually, AFAIK, paid subscription to Pandora costs $3/month and not everybody pays even that. Judging from Pandora&#x27;s income, only minuscule part of the users does.

Do you have a suggestion for how they could be?<p>It&#x27;s true that musicians <i>sort of</i> used to be paid up-front, in the traditional label model where a record company gave a musician a big advance to make an album, and then pocketed most of the actual profits from the sales of that the album (akin to hiring an engineer to build a bridge, then collecting tolls on that bridge). But that&#x27;s no longer the model for most up-and-coming independent artists, and in any case, that just shifts the royalty-collecting burden to the record companies, who still need to be able to recoup their initial advances.<p>Another approach, which works well for bridge-building, is that the government just pays some engineers to build a bridge, then lets everyone use the bridge for free. This is like the <i>really</i> old school practice in which a wealthy prince commissions Beethoven to write a string quartet, and once complete that string quartet is then freely available for anyone to perform. As a model for music in the modern world, this would mean socializing the music production business, i.e., taxing everyone the price of a Spotify subscription and pumping that money into NEA grants for artists to record new music, which would then be free for everyone. On the bright side, this would eliminate all worries about piracy and chilling effects from anti-piracy enforcement. But there are also lots of drawbacks, e.g., in this model the decision as to what music should exist would be made, not by the market (as in the indie model), or a profit-oriented record company (as in the label model), but by government bureaucrats whose incentives come from the political process. Of course this could have some good effects (maybe they&#x27;d fund fewer Justin Biebers) but IMHO there are serious problems with a system in which an artist&#x27;s viabilaity is contingent on their staying in the good graces of the government.<p>Also, just so you know, Pink Floyd is a band, not a person.",1372113399

Sounds like a fun thing to do, especially but it&#x27;s going to take a lot of work. Then once you&#x27;re done with that, you&#x27;ll need to implement reliable delivery with congestion control on top, which also would be a lot of fun but a fair amount of work to do properly.<p>Those are exactly the things I intend to leave out in my initial work. If it happens to catch on, hopefully I&#x27;ll get some help. If not, it will still be very useful to me without those features.<p>> Finally, you&#x27;ll want to add encryption in there; luckily, Go has good crypto libraries, but getting crypto right is still really hard and it&#x27;s easy to mess up and have an insecure system. At the very least, you could use libjingle as your guide.<p>Yup. I think this is one of the things that Bittorrent Sync gets right: strong symmetric AES encrpytion.<p>> By the way, what do you mean by &quot;not to use C++&quot;? Do you mean write it in it, or do you mean use libraries written in it? I can understand the former, but the latter seems a bit extreme. Go makes it pretty easy to link to C libraries. Why not use libjingle from Go? That sounds fun and a lot less work.<p>Not to write in it. In the Go community, there&#x27;s a heavy bias to avoid linking to external libraries if it can be avoided. There is a certain amount of cachet that comes from being able to do `go get ...` and have it work without having to make sure another library is installed.<p>I&#x27;m at the infancy stages of my understanding, so it&#x27;s certainly possible that I&#x27;ll come to my senses and build on top of something else.

5936175,comment,5923899,5924424,1,0,lazzarello,,,"Hello! I built ostel.co. Nice to meet you.<p>Regarding signalling encryption. The system uses SIP TLS with a certificate signed by a common CA. Check it out and walk up the chain manually if you&#x27;re concerned. Certificate pinning is interesting but in this case the signalling isn&#x27;t really what we care about, from a priority perspective. We care about the /content/ of the call, which in SIP land is a completely different protocol with a nice peer to peer key agreement system which is currently unbreakable according to public information. There&#x27;s some classified NSA doc that allegedly says it could be done, read all about it...oh wait, you can&#x27;t because it&#x27;s classified. :(<p>So the reason there isn&#x27;t a bunch of copywriting which discusses the importance of the key agreement in the signalling layer is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very important. Now, one could middle the signalling in a clever way and that could, possibly result in a dropped call, which could be classified as a DoS vuln. But that&#x27;s unlikely and there wouldn&#x27;t be any content leaked. I would be interested in a proof of this attack vector.<p>Finally, my favorite part about middled signalling is that even if you do it right and a whole forged SIP dialog is built up and Mallory answers on the other end when Bob thinks he&#x27;s talking to Alice, you still get to hear Mallory&#x27;s voice! So unless Mallory is pro at doing voice impressions, like that dude on SNL can do Jay-Z and Dr. Dre real good, it&#x27;s gonna be obvs that something is not right.<p>Really Finally, I&#x27;m using Freeswitch to provide diagnostic services like an echo test.

However one &quot;play&quot; on radio or Sirius is equivalent to at least several thousand &quot;plays&quot; on Pandora, as there are many people listening to the radio station (and hence the song) at the same time, while with Pandora it is generally only one or two people listening at a time. So what you really want to compare are the &quot;per listener&quot; royalty rates, which appear to be pretty similar. Say 5000 station listeners * 18797 radio plays = 94M &quot;pandora equivalent plays&quot;. If you compare these adjusted play counts to the royalty amounts, radio only pays 30% higher, not 100 times higher.<p>One could make the argument that a Pandora listener should be worth more, as they are choosing to listen to the personalized Pandora station rather than more forcibly listening to whatever the radio DJ puts on.

Ideally, when something like this happens it makes perfect sense for the US government to take notice of the fact that a law has been broken, bring charges, and take this to court. If the system continues to work the charges will be contested on the grounds that the action was in the interest of the public and that the leaks document a violation of the constitution. The govt drops the charges, and heads off to repair the completely fucked effects of the patriot act, etc.<p>So I agree it&#x27;s naive and even unreasonable to expect the US not to file charges.

Examples are networking, filesystems (still HFS+),  kernel level benchmarks, concurrency, NUMA etc, and especially so compared to what Linux, Solaris, *BSD, and NT have progressed in the last few years.<p>A few years ago, I remember some of their kernel engineers saying Apple&#x27;s performance goals are holistic with their hardware ie prioritise things that the majority of their consumers (mainly low end laptops) would need. This seems reasonable, why invest in best of class IO when most users are on 54g wifi with a single 5400rpm HDD. The problem is now consumer hardware has caught up, gigabit wifi, PCI-e SSDs, 8+cores, retina screens, multi-level cache hierarchies.<p>One thing OSX does extremely well at is power management, and that&#x27;s in a large part due to iOS.

They boil down to an arrangement where certain institutions - mostly local and regional government and non-profits, but the details vary - can post jobs. Those jobs will administrated by the institution itself with minimal central oversight. However, funding comes from the central (monetarily sovereign) government at an hourly wage that is fixed by law.<p>So it is simply an offer that you can take or not. If there is nothing that you like, don&#x27;t take anything. The theory is that there are so many useful things that could be done once money stops being the limiting factor, it&#x27;s extremely unlikely this would happen.<p>Basic income advocates like to say that it allows you to do whatever work <i>you</i> want to do. Well, the Job Guarantee intends to allow essentially the same freedom as long as what you want to do provides some public benefit.<p>That said, there are other proposals for how to generate infinite demand for labor at a fixed price, e.g. this one: <a href=""http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-income-auction-the-unemployed"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.morganwarstler.com/post/44789487956/guaranteed-in...</a>",1372112128

5936043,comment,5934698,5934698,14,0,cperciva,,,"<i>Im an ambitious 19 year old, what should I do?</i><p>This is an interesting question, in my experience: The sets of &quot;most ambitious people I know&quot; and &quot;people who describe themselves as ambitious&quot; seem to be entirely disjoint.  The most ambitious people I know just go out and do things, rather than sitting around thinking (and talking) about how ambitious they are.<p>This may be a cultural thing -- self-describing as &quot;ambitious&quot; is the sort of thing which I find tends to happen thanks to high school career preparation programs (along with &quot;organized&quot;, &quot;reliable&quot;, and &quot;good with people&quot;), and it&#x27;s entirely possible that those school programs are subtly different in the US than in Canada.  However, I can&#x27;t shake the feeling that there&#x27;s a kernel of truth here.",1372111503

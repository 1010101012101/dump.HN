9328082,comment,9327828,9327828,0,0,616c,,,"Fun fact, the credit bureau problem is a real thing in the GCC.<p>So in states like Qatar, many people (I think the majority local citizens) caused enough problems the Central Bank has put many limitations on when people can take out loans.  Friends who have long standing here indicate to me certain families still have banks look the other way, as it risky to dare check their eligibility.  Many people here take out loans, get into arrears, and then go to court and keep negotiating down the debt owed arguing personal problems (I have lots of kids and mouths to feed and business is bad), and keep paying a few payments over the restructured agreement to ignore  it again, go back to court, and keep negotiating the amount owed down.  Not sure true this is, but I am told for many locals running business this is common knowledge.  Ironically, as an expat, the restrictions got very tight because people would just flee, and now you can only leave the country for good once you have a no objection letter, meaning no bank over the course of a week can present you owe debt.  This can get nasty, like the unemployed Irish dude in the neighboring UAE who lives in his car because he had nowhere to stay, no job, and selling his car would not even get him out of debt.<p>Granted, locals and expats alike are incredibly irresponsible, but the lack of credit bureau and honest reporting makes me wonder what America was like in the &quot;good old old days&quot; where creds got you what you wanted.",1428328606

If that quantity of methane were burned, it would increase the CO2 in the atmosphere to about half a percent (ignoring absorption by the oceans, etc) and reduce the oxygen by about 1%.  Going from 21% oxygen to 20% oxygen (which don&#x27;t get me wrong, is impressive) would be significantly less of a change than between sea level and Denver, so I can&#x27;t imagine mammals being threatened.<p>Does anyone else have more information on whether there&#x27;s a plausible threat there?  My take is that we&#x27;d all be dead from increased temperatures and the accompanying ecosystem disruptions long before the oxygen dropped below what we need to survive.",1428328599

For one thing, there were important omissions, like inventions/development in agriculture or communication technology that caused an explosion in resources/means available (which were to stay), whereas Mr. Tainter assumes resources to be limited and declining. Other than the omissions there are just wrong assumptions or metrics. The best example in this regard is US patents that he takes as an indicator of research and development and points that the costs got higher because patents are submitted by (costly) groups. Nowadays not only patents are submitted in groups, but also paperworks, and this is partly political (i.e. an artificial induced phenomenon).

Sure, under most circumstances the rider can guide the elephant, but the elephant can want different things than the rider. In a way the elephant is more important, because if it doesn&#x27;t work along the rider is helpless.

He&#x27;s trying to get the point across to people who are most likely to resist thinking about it, for all the wrong but understandable reasons.</i><p><i>Like with race, climate change, gender issues, religion, those who need this stuff to be explained to the most are also the most likely to resist, because they literally Can&#x27;t Deal With It. It&#x27;s called fragility[2]:</i><p><i>“a state in which even a minimum amount of racial stress becomes intolerable, triggering a range of defensive moves. These moves include outward display of emotions such as anger, fear and guilt, and behaviors such as argumentation, silence and leaving the stress-inducing situation.”</i><p><i>Replace &quot;racial&quot; in that quote with any sensitive issue you want, like &quot;gender&quot;, &quot;political&quot; or &quot;religious&quot;. Everyone has this to some degree, and the first thing to do if you want to have a healthy debate is become aware of everyone&#x27;s point of fragility and somehow circumvent it so we can have a reasonable discussion. Even more so when trying to reach out to the people who suffer from this the most. It is really important we keep trying to do that, no matter how frustrating it can get, because the ignorance of even a few affects everyone in society, especially in a democracy.</i><p><i>It&#x27;s a real problem and John Oliver even lampshades it, calling Snowden the IT guy in the office you don&#x27;t want to learn from. He may appear to be shooting Snowden down, but what he&#x27;s doing is approaching this from point of view of the many people with this mindset.

9327837,comment,9300764,9327260,0,0,hzhou321,,,"Thanks a lot for understanding.<p>I am puzzled why most readers see MyDef as another language or library. Let&#x27;s use Javascript for example, Coffee script or other language force you to re-learn and write in the new language, but with MyDef, we still write JavaScript and use the same pattern we acquired. It is not about re-learn, rather it is about growing. For example, `document.getElementById(&#x27;name&#x27;)`, which you learned the first time starting Javascript, you don&#x27;t have to relearn; but in the meantime you don&#x27;t want to write/think in so much detail, so with MyDef, you start write `$(id:name)` (one of the many ways you can come up). Here, you did not learn the new word, you grew it. Then, you start write `$(type:name)`, `$(value:name)`, `$(show:name)`, `$(hide:name)`, or `$(select:#name)`. Just like the word we use in daily life, when we say &quot;go to school&quot;, we understand what we mean and (more importantly) we immediately get feedback on whether the reality (the kids walks to school bus) meets our expectation. In MyDef, we understand where these idioms are defined and the translated output is right there for us to verify (which is not much different from markdown). In comparison, when we use `$(&quot;#name)`, we only can learn the meaning; if we guess, there is nowhere to directly get feedback -- which forms a disconnect from your old acquired knowledge. Similar with most library and framework, you are disconnected from you old experience (I don&#x27;t mean abandon, but a discontinuity) and re-learn a new set. MyDef is about grow, not re-learn, there isn&#x27;t any barrier.",1428325477

Nobody has time to walk someone every step of the way in fixing an issue or adding a feature -- otherwise we would just do it ourselves.<p>> Ultimately, open source isn’t about code. It’s about community, and as Bert Hubert suggests, “community is the best predictor of the future of a project.” That community isn’t fostered by jerk project leads or corporate overlords pretending to be friendly foundations. It’s the heart of today’s biggest challenges in open source -- as it was in the last decade.<p>Open-source, as the name implies, _is_ about source code and not about a community. It&#x27;s about you, your friends, and anyone else you know being able to get a copy of the source code and being able to modify it however you want to.",1428325440

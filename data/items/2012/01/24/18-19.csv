On top of that, they only have three ""staff"" listed on their site.  USV can ask would-be employees to fly up to NYC to deliver resumes in person and they'll still get plenty of applicants.<p>2) The job openings in the article that focus on surveys and personality tests - supposedly instead of resumes - are clearly unskilled labor (e.g. social media intern).  This is exactly as it was when I applied to work as a waiter at Olive Garden in 2000.<p>3) IGN's coding challenges are similarly suspect as a representatitve example because game dev is a glamor industry with a surfeit of naifs lining up for these underpaid jobs.  Prized developers aren't going to participate in many coding-contest-as-hiring-lottery situations unless they're just really interested in the problem.  Ask a YC company who's ever posted a hiring puzzle: what percentage of your correct submissions were from people who didn't even want the job?<p>The tactics cited above wrongheadedly invert the recruiting plan tptacek uses at Matasano: Start from the assumption that you want the best people possible and that those people will have plenty of great alternatives to working for you.

3506046,comment,3504304,3505740,3,0,rayiner,,,"One can imagine a distributed system of organization, akin to what is used in the internet, but that's still organization. I'm personally a fan of pushing more authority down to the courts, which are both distributed and local. However, at the end of the day it becomes a question of where particular authority exists rather than a question of a need for the existence of authority.<p>We live in a highly interdependent society of 300m people. Highly specialized division of labor has given us a society where any person depends on probably 10,000 others for their basic needs, and modern technology has given us a society where nearly every human activity has the potential to harm large numbers of people. However you want to structure it, you need government to ensure the harmonious operation of such a society. Government is indeed an emergent phenomenon in human societies. As Google grew from a startup to a multi-national, it didn't have the conscious intention of growing a management layer for the sake of having more management. Yet, Google has a lot of management. Indeed, even in computers we see operating systems exploding in size and complexity as computers themselves become more functional and complex.<p>Techies take it for granted that startups grow management as they mature, that operating systems get more complex, that schedulers and out-of-order execution structures eat up increasingly large amounts of die-space in CPU's, yet there is a large contingent that thinks that a government running the affairs of 300 million people could be dramatically (meaning 10x, not 25%). Techies don't bat an eye at an OS that takes up 20% of your memory right off the bat, but in the face of a federal civil service payroll that amounts to 1.5% of GDP, many complain loudly of ""too much government."" Now, there are good arguments to be made that we could trim here and there and maybe get an effective government half the size (though it should be noted our federal system by design doesn't lend itself to particular efficiency), but do you think a federal government with a million employees and $1.5 trillion in expenditures would be so qualitatively different from the one we have now? Of course not.<p>Re: lobbyists, I didn't say anything about the majority of the public having useful things to say about policy. I said that 1) there are lots of policies that need to be made; and 2) there is no practical way for elected officials to make such policies without input from the affected parties (i.e. lobbyists).<p>Let me give you a very specific example. Here in Chicago we have two very dirty coal power plants. They're the product of an elementary market failure (the power company that profits from their operation doesn't bear the staggering health costs of that operation). They're also the product of a basic democratic failure (the health costs are highly localized to poor communities, so in effect voters choose to get cheaper electricity at the expense of a poor minority). Shutting down those coal plants is almost certainly the right thing to do, even on a purely economic calculus. Now, a legislator could read up on economic externalities, demography, and public health, and come to that conclusion. Do you think a group of state legislators, who all work part time, are going to be able to do all that? Hell, all that theory would go completely over the heads of many HN-ers, much less most Illinois state legislators! Someone needs to collect the data, estimate the health consequences of the plants, estimate the economic consequences of shutting them down, put together a policy proposal, and tell a legislator in 5 minutes why it is a good idea. That someone is a lobbyist (whatever you choose to call them).",1327430608

3505983,comment,3504203,3504203,2,0,LeafStorm,,,"The problem isn't lectures. I am taking two mathematics courses this semester that are taught primarily by lecture - Linear Algebra and Discrete Math. Sitting through the Discrete Math lecture would give <i>anyone</i> the impression that lectures are a horrible way to teach - the professor is largely disengaged and just runs through his lecture notes, most of which are already in the textbooks. Homework is the traditional ""go do these hundred problems from the textbook"" affair.<p>The Linear Algebra lecture, on the other hand, is what lectures <i>should</i> be. Dr. Hong (who I am naming because he is awesome) is engaged with the class. He answers everyone's questions, and will call you out if you aren't paying attention. And more importantly, he always thoroughly explains the process and makes <i>sure</i> you understand it (and for all the matrix operations we have learned so far, he also makes sure you understand how to <i>generalize</i> it to larger matrices) before you walk out of the classroom.<p>Then, the homework is optional (though he does joke about killing you if you don't do it.) The goal of the homework in this case isn't to help you understand the material...that's what the lectures are for. He gives homework so students can become <i>efficient</i> at the process after they understand it.<p>So I don't think it's the lecture/homework model that's really broken here. A disinterested instructor will kill the course no matter whether you're lecturing in a classroom and doing problems at home, or lecturing on the Internet and doing problems during class. What's broken is that lecturers don't focus enough on the process and the concepts, instead running through multiple examples and hoping the students pick something up along the way.<p>(At least, for mathematics. I'm not sure how well this teaching style would translate to other disciplines such as history, composition, or even biology.)",1327429881

If you damage it, I have to pay to have it repaired. If I do not maintain it it will no longer work, as well, it will on its own slowly deteriorate over time at which point I must replace it or live without.<p>Nor is intellectual property like that painting I produced. That painting took serious time to create and only one was created. I imagined it, and I painted it. However, someone can freely re-create something like it for themselves, selling it, however, would be considered forgery if they tried to pass it off as their own idea.<p>Digital though is a whole new medium. There are no forgeries or deprivation in digital medium. It is an exact replica of the original in every way and is never destroyed. ""Piracy"" as we use the term on the internet isn't even trying to take ownership of or steal the 'property' only redistribute it. People who are 'pirating' are also not trying to make money off of it (megaupload et al. are making money off of the service the 'pirates' host on not the 'property') but provide it (altruistically?) to others, often with the stipulation of ""you like it you buy it"".<p>Intellectual Property laws need to take a new medium into consideration, we can't just think of it in analogies to the physical world. It's not the physical world. Before the printing press we never imagined that books could be distributed en masse. That created a new type of property, however still restricted on production. The internet has created another, free production, and we/those in power need to realise that restructuring the internet in order to maintain a poor analogy is not the solution. We are a society of Remix, the internet allows us to this better than ever before. Why should we be squelching those who only want to continue the remix?<p>I understand many have heard all this before, but it sometimes feels like no one is listening.<p>As for MPAA/RIAA being the looters; there is no theft of digital products when looked at objectively---only when comparing to the physical medium and when creating analogies for explanation. We've already determined many file sharers purchase the products in addition to sharing. All throughout history we've traded what we love to each other, now we get to copy it to each other. Anecdotally it seems as though the property that is shared and not paid for wouldn't have been paid for in the first place.<p>Then here comes a large group of distributors claiming they represent artists (which, at some points they do) playing bully on the soccer field. Finding people who weren't the original distributors of their digital mind-share, turning them up-side-down, and ruining their lives by taking as much money from them as the courts will allow. A file-shared 'property' is not removing money from the pockets of the artist. It may stop money from being placed in their hand initially, however increases their audience. How many artists have people discovered solely because of a shared file?<p>Who's really depriving others of a livelihood?

So, instead of memorizing ""to call Jack, I have to press J and Down and Down"", I have to always pay attention when the interface changes...<p>Thanks for putting this in words.  This is an example of an innovation that reduces the learning curve to a device, but almost certainly makes it slower for the experienced user.  One of the reasons that I use GNU/Linux on my personal computers is precisely because FOSS interfaces tend to not make this trade-off (as evidenced by Emacs, Vim, Blender, Inkscape, and many more).  So, I am a bit luke warm towards this new HUD interface (then again, I haven't forced myself to swallow the Unity pill yet, either).<p>My keyboard doesn't randomly swap around the keys on my keyboard, and I appreciate that because I spent the time learning to touch type.  Arguably, adaptively moving keys could be faster for 'hunt and peck' typists, but not for people who have spent some time learning how to type.",1327429191

Not only can they present useful information to attending guests, but they can have a blog, registry links, photos and more.<p>My concern right now is that people don't understand why they should upgrade.  Furthermore, they can't really see the advantages and benefits of upgrading to a premium account. Granted it makes sense to me, as I know what all the pages represent, I would love to hear any thoughts in this regard.<p>Thanks in advance.",1257271169

919838,comment,919517,919517,0,0,bravura,,,"I like MongoDB because it is very natural to think about databases as storing JSON-style objects. It's also useful for simple text processing pipelines. You iterate over your database and apply the next step of preprocessing, assuming it doesn't exist in the current object (e.g. if no ""POS tagged text"" field exists, transform ""text"" into ""POS tagged text"").<p>I use MongoDB because it is C++, so it was simple to set up. CouchDB is based upon a Java stack, which I am less familiar at setting up.<p>TokyoDB has the ""tables"" DB type, which I believe extends the value in ""key-value"" to more complicated schema-less types, but the Python support for this DB type isn't very good.",1257271091

That's a lot of classes, a lot of books.<p>Maybe you should try ONE school, namely, yours. You could even prune it down further to certain majors or departments. If someone says ""do you have it for English as well as Math/Computer Science?"" then you know its gaining steam.<p>The idea of class reviews, teacher reviews, along with ""do I need the book?"" would be a natural progression as others have discussed.<p>To get more popularity with your own school, heavily brand it as long as they don't get on your back for using their logos. Because its a tool to facilitate their students they may not care, but because its a tool that could dampen their book sale profits, they might.<p>Another opportunity to make it easier is possibly integrate with existing school systems. I went to Virginia Tech, and for web developers inside the school system (again, speaking merely from my own experience) they had APIs that you could lock into course/class IDs, and even had an API that could authenticate with University PIDs and passwords. Doing so this way would automatically manage all of the classes and book information - then the students would merely have to thumb up or down if they found the book helpful. When you expand schools, integrating Facebook or other social networking credentials would be the obvious route, but to paraphrase 37Signals, ""you don't have a scaling problem until you have a scaling problem.""<p>You have an EXCELLENT idea - anyone who has been to college and has felt the weight of text book costs (along with the economy) would instantly see this as a great opportunity to save some beans.",1257270821

Third, it's only an element in your service, and branding it strongly competes with your primary DDG brand and creates pointless confusion for the user.<p>but overall I really like it, and think the quality of the results is very high.

Essentially the A3 is used as a structured method of problem definition, requirment planning, and solution implementation tracking within the business.  A3 originally refers to the size of paper that the analysis was performed on. A pretty basic and typical outline of an A3 process can be found here (<a href=""http://www.coe.montana.edu/IE/faculty/sobek/A3/steps.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coe.montana.edu/IE/faculty/sobek/A3/steps.htm</a> ).  To my understanding, originally the A3 process was done with paper and pencil, and the A3 updated as conditions or understanding of the problem changed.  The size of the paper (16.5"" Ã— 23.4"") allowed for a fairly deep analysis of the problem.  A3s can be used for anything from analysis of a single failure, all the way up to planning at the business level, with cascading A3s below being referenced by higher level a3s to drive specific actions all the way to the implementation level.<p>In practice the deep analysis of an A3 tends to be squeezed onto a single powerpoint slide (which makes Mr. Tufte cry) and much of the problem solving and communicative power of the A3 is lost.",1257269397

Combined, they represent the cable route of a significant portion of the network. The rest of the cable is run along lines for which Qwest leases the right of way for up to 50 years, or along interstate highways, where it leases rights of way from transportation authorities for 20 or 25 years.

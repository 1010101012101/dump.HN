People tell me all the time how ""brave"" and ""bold"" I am for starting a startup and it's complete BS.  The only think we're risking is some money, reputation and ego.  All of which grow back in time.  If we were doused with gas, lit on fire and smashed with ewok log traps if our startups failed then we would be bold. As it is we're just different. ",1184830175

35211,comment,35207,35207,0,0,gregp,,,"Ive recently been contracting with a large media/design company that among other things incubates web businesses and other ideas. Besides thier own internal ideas they also bring in alot of VC backed companies that need development/design work. These are all web businesses that are essentially outsourcing thier entire product/service frontend/backend development to a third party. This seems flawed right off the bat to me because of the development loop being so large (client -> proj. manager -> my proj. manager -> me) but also it sort of makes sense that there are companies that can charge an arm & leg for work like that and people actually pay it - the clients do not understand the nature of software development and the need for a fast turn around on functionality. Anyways, just wanted to comment on this point of view.",1184829559

Nobody's answering their support emails.<p>Ordinarily I would just leave it behind as a lost cause, but one of the sites I created keeps accumulating spam, and I need  the brief attention of someone at the server to take care of it.

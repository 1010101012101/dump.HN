4956344,comment,4955344,4956211,3,0,reneherse,,,">If you believe that the purpose of a film format is simply to convey moving images to the viewer with as much fidelity and control as possible, as I do, then 48 FPS is objectively better<p>As used in the current film, 48FPS diminishes <i>selectivity of detail</i>, one of the most important attributes of any artform. In this film it is ALL detail, ALL the time.<p>For an analogy, think of it in literary terms: 48FPS is akin to a writer endlessly pouring over every minute detail of his scene, at the expense of plot, characterization, theme, etc. In literature, that might become a hallmark of style (Dickens), but even so, when the plot needs to move, one dials down the descriptiveness. In film, we're swept along at the movie's pace, and there isn't always time to process the blanket intensity of detail at 48 FPS. It can easily draw our attention to non-essential parts of the shot, and overwhelm visual attention at the expense of auditory story-tracking.<p>FWIW, I saw the film in 48 FPS 3D, and I truly tried to be as open minded and objective about what I was viewing, trying to approach the content, style, and technology on its own terms. (I find this is often the way to get the most enjoyable experience out of a movie.) There were moments when I found the level of detail breathtaking. Unfortunately, there were more where I found it to be distracting, and the motion strangely awkward. For the most part, I did appreciate the lack of motion blur on panning shots.<p>Perhaps what is needed is a new method of dialing the detail up or down within the shot when using HFR, beyond the current means of focus, depth of field, and lighting. Like a painter selectively using detailed rendering techniques on different faces within a scene, filmmakers shooting at 48 FPS could then more easily direct their audience's glance and attention according to the aims of the narrative.<p>But as in any art, there's no easy answer here. It's always going to be about tradeoffs.",1356173773

4956342,comment,4955344,4956211,2,0,geuis,,,"I'm not a purist trying to make the argument that 24fps is the best thing since cheese for movies. Thats like the folks that say vinyl offers better sound than digital. I'm not an audiofile so I never noticed.<p>About a week ago I was at the Microsoft campus in Redmond and had a chance to watch an action scene from the last Batman movie in one of their living room studios. The TV was pretty new and was showing the movie in interpolation mode or something. Subjectively, it looked like the Hobbit did. It didn't seem natural and kept pulling me out of enjoying the film. This comes with the comparison that I saw the same Batman movie in the theater this year and it looked much better at the slower frame rate.<p>I believe the optimal goal for fps is to mimic exactly what the human brain perceives with vision. Movies and/or video games should eventually seem like you're a spectator or looking through a window.<p>I just read through this page and it provides some good background, <a href=""http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.100fps.com/how_many_frames_can_humans_see.htm</a>.<p>Basically, I think what was lacking in the Hobbit was a significant amount of motion blur. That's what we get naturally at a lower frame rate like 24fps. Simply pumping up the fps to 48 without adjusting for motion blur is what makes it feel weird. It definitely provides more visual detail, but that isn't optimal for the viewing experience.<p>I think an interesting experiment to do in the next few months will be to take the 48fps non-3D version of the Hobbit and add motion blur in certain test scenes while maintaining the higher frame rate. I hypothesize this will let us see more detail and make the images richer while appearing more natural to the brain.",1356173758

From what she's saying I'm drawing the conclusion that mental illness correlates with drug use which correlates with violence. The prevalence of mental illness in the population is small, so the proportion of the mentally ill among violent criminals is also small, but if mental illness is a predictor of violence then being more aggressive about institutionalizing the mentally ill would provide society a better return on investment with respect to preventing violence than policies aimed at the general population (such as gun control).",1356173727
4956340,comment,4956198,4956198,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Well, not necessarily. There is plenty of good code out there. The dirty little secret of software development is that bad code is an effort sink. Let me run through a few truisms about bad code and see where they lead us, development wise.<p>Bad code is buggier, so it will require fixing more often.<p>Bad code is more difficult to understand and sometimes has non-intuitive side effects or method of operation and so working on it will take longer.<p>Because of the convoluted way that bad code often works, adding features or doing maintenance on it often makes it even more convoluted and difficult to work on.<p>Bad code typically has lower performance, so it will require more attention to improve performance. Due to the above 3 factors this becomes a vicious cycle of sinking effort into the code only to make it that much harder to work on in the future.<p>For these simple reasons bad code becomes a huge time sink. Programming tasks involving good code end up taking up a much smaller portion of the developer-effort budget because it's so much easier to work on that code, while the bad code takes so much more effort and often the code base just ends up even worse than before, perpetuating the phenomenon through to the next cycle of development.<p>The only way out of this cycle is to identify the code that is the main source of bugs and the main sink of effort then budget out more than enough time to tackle it and improve it. But most development shops aren't proactive enough, introspective enough, or set aside enough dev-resources to be capable of doing that. Even though such efforts tend to have an enormous impact on future development.",1356173717

So you can see, yes also in Python, the most incredible constructions which 'work' but are hardly real code and do not work outside of the required examples.<p>Code in real world companies is mostly horrible, especially when the company gets bigger and older.

4956332,comment,4956198,4956303,4,0,RyanZAG,,,"Readable to you after years of study of the CS principles and languages behind Haskell, but literally unreadable and undecipherable to the majority of current programmers. This is a major problem, even if you choose to ignore it and remain in an ivory tower.<p>That said, the actual problem described in the article has this issue at the very core - we have more software we need written than we have people who can write good Haskell. This means that a large percentage of software is going to be written poorly - and the only real solution would be to simply have less software.<p>Supply-Demand overrides this completely, and so bad software will remain. The true challenge is therefore making software that can be written by the semi clueless and yet still be decipherable enough to maintain. Java and C# seem to have cornered this market to great effect in the business landscape from my experience.<p>I think current language development trends towards functional programming is a mistake as it caters to such a tiny audience, and more emphasis should be placed on new languages that can force people to write good code.<p>Is this possible? Dumb example: If someone is hacking together computations of circles without knowing about PI, is there any possible way for a language to help here?<p>I think a language that can make it clear what the code is trying to do, even when written by someone who has no clue, would go a long way to being able to filter out and fix bad code quicker.

For example, implementation of hashing algorithm or HashMap.<p>You just can't compare the requirements of ""science"" part with requirements of ""real world business system"". The ""science"" requirements are almost laughably trivial. And the documentation of business system will run into thousands of pages.<p>Now, you say if you just refactored the code, if you saw the ""grand design"" and rewrote the code to accommodate every little requirement elegantly and with proper abstractions and so on... I will say you would just end up with system so abstract and general, no-one would understand exactly how it is meeting those requirements. Because you would had generalized every special case (where it should've stayed a special case, and that's that).<p>So in a way, the simple hacked-together awful program might actually make more sense than the elegant and grand abstract program. Because you can follow the hacked-together program, and you can't follow the arhitected program.

Perhaps law firms that walk the line of ethical behavior but are clearly behaving immorally by any reasonable standard present a sort of edge case. Usually, a moral person should settle his disputes in a civilized manner by going through the proper legal channels. However, if a moral person is being abused by a law firm that is capable of outmaneuvering him in all or almost all legal proceedings, what recourse does that person have? A good analogy is a battered wife who is reasonably certain that going to the police will result in her husband murdering her. In such cases, courts have ruled that a wife may initiate force against her husband and yet be acting in self-defense.<p>Another analogy is the idea that it's possible for the US government to become so corrupt and/or abusive that revolution becomes justified. If the people of the US were ever to attempt a revolution, however, they would certainly be labeled terrorists by the US government, and their actions would be considered treasonous. Nevertheless, there is a point at which revolution is theoretically justifiable, despite being treasonous. That point is when it becomes impossible to participate in the political process.

4956293,comment,4955344,4955664,0,0,baddox,,,"There are so many ludicrous arguments in The Verge article.<p>> For some [filmmakers], HFR will be a potential new tool in their arsenal for telling certain types of stories in a new and exciting way, while others will be reminded of why the 2D format at 24 fps has stood the test of time for so long.<p>Just like dial-up for Internet and horses for transportation stood the test of time for so long. This is such an unabashed argument that ""it should stay this way because it has been this at for so long"" that I feel sympathetic embarrassment upon reading it.<p>The author's failure to be immersed is clearly due to his a priori insistence that 24 FPS is <i>the way</i> movie should be shot and projected. He says that himself. But there is more:<p>> In the opening hour of The Hobbit shown in 3D HFR  I dont recall hearing a single sigh, or laugh.   Not one.    When I went to see the exact same seen with an audience of the same size on a 2D projection  I heard regular chuckles and laughter why?<p>Here's why: because there are really high odds that of all the people across the world that watched the movie in both formats, at least one person would experience this. Why did Bob win the lottery? Is it because he's good at guessing lottery numbers, or is it because the odds were high that someone would win the lottery, and we chose Bob for analysis after learning that he won? In case anyone wants a counter-anecdote, I watched The Hobbit in both formats and there was a lot of laughter in both theaters. I don't have any real evidence, but I suspect most showings in all formats had considerable laughter.<p>> Its like being on a film set in person: all of the magic is lost.   You get to see behind the curtain and youre no longer under the spell<p>I think most critics and movie buffs are well aware that ""the magic"" comes from the viewer's deliberate choice to suspend disbelief. If this weren't the case, then filmmakers themselves would be unable to enjoy a film, since they would fully understand most aspects of how the film was produced. Again, this just reaffirms the author's own admission that he will only choose to be immersed if a film is projected in 24 FPS.<p>> The makeup wasnt as terrible as some people say, and most of the VFX were stunning but not all.   When I saw them in 2D however  it was almost like seeing another film.   My attention wasnt drawn to them  As I was focusing on central action.    That challenges the ""Suspension of Disbelief"" theory that we all need to believe what we are seeing on screen and to get lost in it<p>Oh boy. The author seems unaware that all or nearly all modern theory about suspension of disbelief places most of the responsibility on the viewer, not the artist. No artist can forcefully make you forget or ignore the fact that you're sitting down in a dark room with a bunch of other people.<p>I suppose I cannot dispute the author's claims about experiencing physical pain from the 3D. Perhaps there truly is some sort variation in people's visual systems that causes this. Other than the slight physical discomfort from wearing 3D glasses over my corrective glasses, all I can say is I haven't experienced that. If this were his central criticism, then it would be valid, although depending on the rate of occurrence of this medical condition it may or may not be reasonable to expect a blockbuster filmmaker to accommodate those who suffer from it.",1356171601

4956289,comment,4954958,4956091,1,0,justinschuh,,,"I have no idea what that link is supposed to be demonstrating. It doesn't say how they measured memory usage (private working set, address space, ouija board stacks?) and doesn't share any of their data sets. It's an arbitrary set of claims devoid of substantiating context, and as someone who has measured this before, it doesn't appear to align with reality.<p>The fact is that single process versus multiprocess carries different tradeoffs with respect to memory. A single process has an advantage in the short run, in that it will consume less memory initially. However, in terms of private working set memory across multiple tabs you're simply not going to see anything like the 2x claimed in that link, given that much of the address space maps to shared pages. So, most likely the authors just weren't properly measuring memory usage per-browser.<p>On the flip side, a multi-process architecture has its own strong advantages for memory consumption. Any complex, long-running application is going to have to contend with memory leaks and fragmentation, which exert increasing memory pressure over the life of an active process. This gets even more painful when considering the multitude of heaps in your average browser, chrome layers written in Web technologies, and (iirc) Firefox using a non-moving, non-generational GC. Whereas a multi-process browser has a vastly cleaner solution to all of that: it simply disposes of an entire address space (including all fragments and leaks) when  it's done with a rendering context.<p>Now, I don't want to undermine the really great work that the Mozilla guys have done addressing leaks and fragmentation, with things like cycle detection, JavaScript compartments, and various detection and analysis tools. However, the simple fact is that users who keep their browsers open for many hours, days, or weeks at a time are generally going to suffer from these issues more under Firefox than Chrome or protected mode IE.",1356171457

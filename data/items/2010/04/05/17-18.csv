My guess is that they wanted to refute the official reports step-by-step to maximize the impact of their leak, and so that there would be little chance of it being swept under the rug by yet another official denial.<p>Yes, it may come off as propaganda, but why would WikiLeaks want to do all of the hard work acquiring the video, decrypting it, and bearing legal repercussions from releasing it only to have the other major news organizations do the analysis and reap the rewards? WikiLeaks is in need of cash, so there's an incentive for them to provide the full report; and additionally, they do seem to be motivated by a sense of justice, so why entrust the same old news media who might not give it the attention it deserves?",1270490360

There aren’t many nonexperts who can accomplish that. Expertise needs schooling, maturation, taste, and quite a lot of attitude.<p>The foregoing explains why home cooks have nothing to teach experienced chefs or indeed any artistic creators, since talent doesn’t scale as you give more and more cooks access to the pots and stoves in their own kitchens. It further explains why one’s inability to eat this (beautiful gourmet meal behind glass at a museum) means precisely nothing. Nobody needs to taste a gourmet meal to enjoy looking at it, except those who have no capacity for enjoyment other than eating and complaining about same.<p>This was the weekend those of us with high standards lost their remaining residue of patience for ideologues who hyperbolize about homemade food without actually creating something people want to look at.",1270487028

If no one is interested in buying your stock and you try to sell it, its value will be zero. Also, if everyone holding a certain stock starts selling it, in the end the value will drop down back to zero. So everything earned by someone is lost by someone else.

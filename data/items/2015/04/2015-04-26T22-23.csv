Sure, you could start selling off stocks from your portfolio, incurring various transaction fees, capital gains taxes, plus you know have to reoptimize your portfolio on the fly because since you sold off some stocks, it&#x27;s now probably out of balance.  Or, you could just buy puts on S&P 500 and you don&#x27;t have to deal with any of those issues.  It&#x27;s much more convenient and efficient to do that.

9443603,comment,9442157,9442157,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>What do I do? Do I simply begin looking for other positions?</i><p>If you mean external other positions, the answer is yes.<p>Looking for internal transfer is not going to be effective. Once on a PIP, your odds of moving are effectively zero. No one will say that transfer&#x27;s impossible (legal/HR reasons) but it&#x27;s basically over. It sounds like you were a good worker but broke the #1 Rule of Corporate Employment: make the boss happy. Don&#x27;t worry; this is a common mistake.<p><i>Do I report his increasingly erratic behavior, and waste of firm resources?</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not worth your time, and it won&#x27;t get you your job back. You have 30 days to live, and it takes months to beat a bad boss. Not only that, but it takes reports from about 3-5 subordinates and most people aren&#x27;t willing to risk their jobs. Corporations value consistency over correctness and his being a manager means that they trust him over you. You won&#x27;t win. You&#x27;ll hurt him a little bit, but that shouldn&#x27;t be your goal.<p>I know someone who actually beat his boss. He had a bad boss, he got a bad performance review for something that wasn&#x27;t his fault, and he managed to get five or six people to hit his boss with the same story in &quot;360 reviews&quot; and take him down. It took months and, while his performance reviews were amended, he was still screwed. Even though he had taken out one of the worst managers in the company, managers (like police) tend to protect their own, at least when it comes to the outside world, and no one wanted to promote him or take him on. He ended up getting laid off a year later.<p><i>Do I quit before the period expires?</i><p>Only if you find another job. You might get a severance if they fire you. If you quit while you don&#x27;t have a job, you get nothing and the result (you&#x27;re unemployed) is the same as if you&#x27;d been fired.<p>You are going to get fired at the end of the 30 days, but getting fired isn&#x27;t (except in a few overly chatty/cliquish industries) a big deal at all.<p><i>I do not wish to move, and if fired I will be effectively blackballed from most firms in this city.</i><p>Why? Most people, by age 40, have been fired at least once. It sucks, but it&#x27;s not the Scarlet F that you might think. If you pass the siege test (6 months of savings) then it may be expensive, but you&#x27;ll survive it.<p>As for reputation issues: I think the firm will be good to you unless it&#x27;s run by idiots. You have knowledge of illegal activity. You absolutely cannot leverage that in asking for a cash severance (it&#x27;s extortion) but, if they don&#x27;t agree to a contractually-guaranteed positive reference, it might be time to bring up the fact of the need to reach mutual agreement on a story that is beneficial to both parties. You&#x27;ll probably get an arrangement in which you can represent yourself as employed during your job search. You may get a contractual written reference and an agreement by your manager not to contradict it.<p>They would rather let you go in a way that doesn&#x27;t blackball you than have you blow the whistle. Trust me.<p>Use your colleagues as references and have your manager&#x27;s reference checked by a third party, even if you have a contract. Unless his reference is glowing, don&#x27;t use him. Say that your manager went on a mission to Uganda and that&#x27;s why you can&#x27;t use him, or that you were managerless due to bureaucratic error but colleagues X, Y and Z can speak for your ability. Or, take the risk and tell the truth: you refused to do something illegal and were fired for it. (Say as little as possible; bad-mouthing an ex-employer is generally a no-no, and it&#x27;s usually seen as better for both sides to tell a mutually face-saving lie than to expose an ex-employer&#x27;s bad behavior.)<p>You should reach out to me (michael.o.church at Google&#x27;s email service) if you still have questions.<p>Getting fired is bad-- three months of joblessness is expensive, especially if they fight your unemployment claim-- but it&#x27;s not catastrophic and the likelihood that any of this follows you is low.<p>Also, it&#x27;s actually pretty hard to blackball someone. I&#x27;ve had people try to blackball me and I ended up winning. In some cases, I&#x27;ve made the attempts to do so very expensive for the people involved.",1430088266

Odds are that in a competent organization, the list&#x27;s ordering will be based on the connectivity of the graph, with the critical nodes coming first. Or, at the very least, everyone&#x27;s going to know which nodes are the critical ones, and given a power-scale graph distribution that&#x27;s the vast bulk of what there <i>is</i> to know, because there are generally very few critical nodes unless you&#x27;ve gone <i>way</i> out of your way to somehow super-decentralize your network.<p>Assuming basic competence (i.e., neither blithering ignorance nor any sort of extreme skill), both sides are well aware that it&#x27;s a graph.

9443581,comment,9441749,9443121,0,0,Jach,,,"For your example bug I think you&#x27;re wrong that static types would have made the bug impossible. What you need is strong type checking and a lack of auto-conversion. For example, in Java, this compiles:<p><pre><code>    int[] bodies = {1, 2, 3};
    for (int body : bodies) {
        String formatted_body = &quot;<p>&quot; + body + &quot;</p>&quot;;
        callMethodWithStrArg(formatted_body);
    }
</code></pre>
And if in this hypothetical case it was previously a `String[] bodies` and a `String body`, I bet a lot of programmers would use an auto-refactoring tool because &quot;static types and auto-refactoring go together for being confident in changes like apples and pie&quot; and I bet the error wouldn&#x27;t have been noticed even at review time. God help you if you&#x27;re using a static language without generics that has implicit type conversions. In Python, though, this raises an error:<p><pre><code>    bodies = [1, 2, 3]
    for body in bodies:
      formatted_body = &#x27;<p>&#x27; + body + &#x27;</p>&#x27;

Even if the usage is low compared to mobile, it only makes sense to stop if it&#x27;s a long-term net negative.<p>Personally, this makes me suspect bad architecture. If they&#x27;ve got well-factored APIs, the additional cost of maintaining a modest web presence should be pretty low. From what they describe, mobile is now somewhere between 40 and 60% of their traffic. Even if they were pretty sure that the trend to mobile would continue, why wouldn&#x27;t they just hedge their bets by investing less in the HTML front end until the web traffic is really negligible? Few people use faxes anymore, but a lot of businesses still publish fax numbers just in case.<p>Assuming that this isn&#x27;t purely internal politics, then my best guess is that they have a lot of terrible web code.

This is part of what being human is about. If men crave sex, it doesn&#x27;t follow that they should rape women lest they are left with a gap or something missing. I used to love eating meat more than most people I know, but stopped eating it years ago since it didn&#x27;t make any sense to me that for my pleasure a sentient animal should suffer and die. I have no trouble dealing with the gap...<p>Note that I&#x27;m not judgemental about my friends or any other people that eat meat. Life is not black and white - everyone can make their choices and I know vegetarians and vegans who can take morality lessons from meat eaters - but at least we should call a spade a spade. Unless it&#x27;s crucial for your own survival, I believe eating meat brings more suffering than joy to the world.",1430085985

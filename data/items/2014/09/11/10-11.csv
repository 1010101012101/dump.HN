8301838,comment,8299577,8299577,9,0,netcan,,,"This is a part of my perspective as a European:<p>The prevailing system of government in the world at present is a mix of socialism, capitalism, welfarism and the philosophically unchampioned  realpolitik practices that were picked up and spread over the years.<p>In any case, Europe has a philosophical heritage of socialism. It&#x27;s different flavors at different times in different places.  There is also conservatism, capitalist liberalism. All sorts. But socialism is not a bad word in Europe. It&#x27;s not like flying a swastika. It&#x27;s part of the political heritage of many parties & people of the political centre.<p>In any case, I think that socialism including Marx&#x27;s own writings read in its 1840s political context contain valuable perspectives. That is, you can think of the world as a self organizing playground for heroic, creative individuals as Ayn Rand does. I dig that perspective. You can view the economy as a mechanical ecosystem as many &quot;modern&quot; economists do (including   Milton Friedmanesque monetarism, Keynes, and to a lesser extent Austrian School). That&#x27;s valuable perspective too too, though far less poetic and invigorating.<p>Back to socialism, it&#x27;s an important part of <i>our</i> heritage. The history of political, moral and philosophical thought. At the heart of it is class. Class struggle. Class Consciousness. Just thinking about societal dynamics in terms of classes.<p>The majority of incarcerated Americans are members of certain classes where    incarceration is common. Americans, with their allergic reactions to socialist language avoid this construct or paradigm. Instead they think of it as culture, or &quot;<i>socio-economics</i>&quot; a watered down Marxist paradigm without much of the richness.<p>Prisons, prison complexes and such have always been a class issue. Avoiding this perspective is avoiding the clearest historical perspective of the problem. The whole modern idea of prisons is not that old. People were not incarcerated for decades in the 1600s. Modern prisons, correctional institutions came into being with the industrial age to deal with the class instability of that period. The lowest classes (beneath the working class majority) were prone to crime, drunkenness and generally antisocial lifestyle.<p>Public sadism solutions (public executions and torture) gave way to forced labour Forced labour gave way to public prisons. These were enabled by <i>Bigger Government</i> (to use an americanism) and a vernal super-sizing of public institution.  Along the way, exile (eg Australian & American prison colonies) was tried and some other solutions. But it was always and still is a way of dealing with the underclass problem. Those poor bastards who get the worst of any societal system from Feudalism to Capitalism to Nordic Social Democracy.<p>Whenever I see American underclass issues bubble to an overflowing boil, from my removed location I see class. I see people growing up in a sector of society with certain norms and expectations. Their part of the economy and the society is mostly defined by class.  The encouragement of outliers breaking out of this fate is admirable, but it does not change the realities of class. As people, we continue societies that we are born into for the most part. We also break out and rebel and redefine paradigms. But, classes are sticky. People follow the paths laid out for them from birth.<p>TLDR: Americans, get over your socialism allergy. Read Marx & Trotsky. Read it in context. Pay attention to the parts about classes in society and their role in history. Discard the bad parts, but read it first before you determine which parts are good and which are bad.",1410432995

In fact, attraction/taste is most often not even a choice!<p>So, for example, just because I&#x27;m attracted to women (and not attracted to men), it doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m sexist. Likewise, just because someone isn&#x27;t attracted to black/asian/redhead men/women, doesn&#x27;t mean they are discriminating.<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re making <i>choices</i> that are based on race (i.e. not trusting someone who is black - apparently police in the US is quite prone to that), it&#x27;s either discrimination or racism. Sometimes, discrimination helps us survive (that big dangerous-looking man coming your way? better run), but very often, it&#x27;s based on irrelevant things (black man driving an expensive car? must be a drug dealer!!), or even institutionalized (women can&#x27;t own property). I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s inherently bad.<p>Edit: I personally consider <i>any</i> institutionalized discrimination bad and immoral. Grants for black students are bad, IMO. On the other hand, grants for poor students (the majority of which will be black (in the US), but not all of them) are good.",1410432873

So 29 degrees with 90% humidity and fan would be much more comfortable than 29 degrees with 30% humidity and fan.<p>In Delhi (45 degrees in summer) we would manage with desert coolers + fan, which specifically work by increasing the humidity of the air and then using a fan.<p>I believe though that, AC vs. coolers vs. fans vs. any combination of them is really not at all as important as the way cities and the buildings within them are built. In Delhi it is estimated that 3-5 degrees local heating is caused by bad urban design. As an anecdote, I&#x27;ve been in mud-huts where despite 45 degree temperatures outside, insides felt like they were AC.

So consumption overall is a small fraction of what an equivalent household in the US would spend.<p>A large factor in that is that energy prices here are substantially higher per unit than in the US.<p>To break that statement down:<p>- AC acounts for approximately 20% of year-round electricity consumption by American households<p>So when looking at the average household electricity bill 20% of that consumption will be on account of AC<p>- and 15% of total electricity use.<p>That&#x27;s if you factor in all other uses besides household (so including offices and factories, and offices also use AC so that&#x27;s why the percentage didn&#x27;t drop that much).<p>- The widespread use of AC explains in large part why Americans use so much more electricity than Europeans: AC electricity use by an American household equals 60% of all electricity used by the average European household.<p>Taking the total consumption of the average European household and comparing that to the US electricity bill the AC consumption portion of the American household is already equal to 60% of the EU total household consumption.<p>So if the EU household consumes 100KWh (just a number) the US household will expend 60KWh on AC, for a total consumption of about 300KWh. So three times as much total consumption. Just by cutting the AC component out that would drop to 2.4 times as much. The remainder can be explained by differences in area, more energy efficient appliances, less electric heat (very rare in the EU, baseboard heating is very normal in the US) and in general a more energy consumption conscious lifestyle because of the higher energy prices.",1410431053

I normally rely heavily on Cmd-Shift-4 on OS X for measuring stuff on screen (click, drag, then Esc to cancel before actually taking a screenshot), but I have a feeling this extension will be a pretty significant improvement over my approach. Great work!<p>For those that don&#x27;t see a use case: Chrome&#x27;s dev tools work well for measuring things within the context of the box model, but so much of what I measure on a regular basis isn&#x27;t captured there. The best example I can think of is measurements relative to some text&#x27;s baselineâ€”the distance between the bottom baseline of some text and the border of its parent container, including adjustments for line height, padding, and related margins, for instance. This extension would also work for things that aren&#x27;t even represented in the box model, like the distance between two shapes in a <canvas> element.<p>One feature suggestion: it&#x27;d be great to be able to click or use another keyboard shortcut to set arbitrary anchor points on the page.

The program gets it wrong at least some of the time.<p>In the case of contact list synchronization, like Google Contacts, the system assumes that the device the operator is editing at the moment is the source, and acts accordingly. Notice that a positive determination is made as to what the source and destination are, based on the operator&#x27;s activity and its timing.<p>In all other cases where two directory trees are synchronized, are made to have the same content, and in which files may be deleted as well as added, the operator has to tell the program which is the source and which is the destination.

When you point to the sky, you are asked to calibrate by rotating the device multiple times while keeping the focus on the plane [1]<p>While I understand how FlightRadar works, with just my GPS coordinates how does the app correctly identify the plane that I&#x27;m pointing to?

The principle exceptions are all domesticated animals:  cattle, sheep, hogs, and the like.<p>After humans, the largest non-domesticated predator mammal population is likely crabeater seals (11-12 million); land predator, the American black bear (850-950 thousand).  There are fewer than half the California sea lions statewide (355 thousand) than there are residents of San Francisco (837 thousand).  Most major land predators number in the tens of thousands worldwide, or fewer.<p>Among ungulates (divided amongst even and odd toed variants for some reason), water buffalo are the most numerous non-domesticated population at about 172 million, followed by species of duiker (7 & 2 million).  American bison number 530,000, reduced from a pre-Columbian population of 60 million, and a low of 750 total individuals in 1890.<p>Of the non-domesticated odd-toed ungulates (generally: horse-like), most numerous are the plains zebra, at 660,000.

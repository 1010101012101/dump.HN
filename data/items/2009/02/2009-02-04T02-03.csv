You need to keep track of your calorie consumption, or you will just end up eating more.  At least that was my experience.  Restricting calories, on the other hand, works with or without exercise.

It remains unclear to me how the housing crisis can be ""fixed"" until the underlying home values fall in line with historical price:income ratios.  That is, either real incomes must rise significantly, or real housing prices must decrease much more than they already have.  Anything short of that will serve only to delay the inevitable.",1233715425

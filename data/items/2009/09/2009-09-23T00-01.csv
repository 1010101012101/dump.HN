838380,comment,837698,837698,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"I've always thought smaller scales were better. I think asking people to rate something on a 1-5 scale is optimistic. A 1-10 scale is simply insanity. No one, without substantial effort, can reasonably rank something from 1-10... even if they think they can. I once had someone try to convince me that they could rank the attractiveness of girls accurately on a scale of 1-100, differentiating between every point on the scale. I don't think anyone would argue that that's insane. I feel the same way about 1-10 scales. It simply isn't possible. When a particular rating is really important, I say use 1-4. I think preventing people from picking a middle answer will help get more honest opinions. If it's an issue about which you can truly be apathetic, 1-3. Hacker News seems to do quite well with a scale of 1-1 on submissions, or perhaps we should call it a scale of apathy-opinion.<p>Maybe for YouTube they could count opinion votes when someone watches the same video twice or uses the embed/share feature. If someone watches a video but never shares it or watches it again, then I think it's fair to say they were apathetic about it.",1253667535

Not everyone is best suited for any one job, of course, but that hardly suggests that any one arbitrary class alone is not well suited for it.<p>Considering the average salary, benefits, and job conditions when stacked against many - although certainly not all - careers, being a software developer can be a pretty sweet prize indeed.

If Taco Bell implemented a policy limiting you to one taco at a time, rather than allowing you to handle all your (stomach-churning) food needs all at once, each order would take less time.

No one (or almost no one) spends 2 months coding an iPhone app, only to just flat-out give up when it gets rejected. They fix the problem (or what they think is the problem after attempting to decipher Apple's rejection notice), and get back in line. By implementing this policy, Apple decreases their efficiency by adding managerial overhead - instead of one reviewer getting assigned one ticket once and handling three problems, those three problems are spread out over (I'm guessing) three different reviewers, which means time wasted dealing with each reapplication.<p>Anyone who's ever developed software understands this intuitively: If you're fixing a reported bug, and in the process of doing so, discover a related bug which you know will be reported eventually, you don't fix the first and ignore the second. It may seem attractive, but you just know that another full cycle of report -> project manager -> scheduling -> reassignment -> new developer reading & getting caught up -> fixing -> QA is just wasting everyone's time.<p>Not to mention, making app developers, who are literally walking Apple profit machines, go to the back of the queue time and time again without even telling them why is just stupid business.",1253665828

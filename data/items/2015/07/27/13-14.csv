9955212,comment,9954684,9954962,0,0,wk_end,,,"When talking about graphics that&#x27;s correct, but I think in this kind of context the &quot;8-bit&quot; refers more to (nostalgic, rose-tinted memories of) the visual style of so-called 8-bit consoles, in particular the NES/Famicom, and most consoles that we consider 8-bit didn&#x27;t allow for anywhere near 256 colours on-screen. Here the 8-bit qualifier refers to the 6502 CPU&#x27;s word size; the NES in-particular only had a total palette size of 54 colours [1], and additional colour limitations meant that in practice you&#x27;d rarely see more than around ~25 at a time.<p>Or take the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, a 16-bit console; its colour capabilities didn&#x27;t give anything close to 2^16 = 65536 on-screen colours. Instead you got a 9-bit palette with only around 64 on-screen colours [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Famicom.2FNES"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_pal...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_palettes#Mega_Drive.2FGenesis"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_console_pal...</a>",1438005590

But it is still violated by lots of PHP projects, including well-known projects with large userbases:<p><pre><code>    * Wordpress\n    * Tiki\n    * ... and so on.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think this is by accident: This technique is too old and well-known to be ignored by large projects. Rather, they conciously don&#x27;t do that to cause less hassle for the occasional admin: Those can simply dump it into some directory and don&#x27;t have to setup a proper docroot or anything.

9955151,comment,9954686,9955033,0,0,acdha,,,"I understand the argument but it&#x27;s very weak because open source projects have the same fundamental problem and we have something approaching two decades of security problems caused by it. The underlying challenge is that anyone can ship a copy of something without making a binding commitment to ship updates.<p>Point 3 is only true if you cherry-pick “OSS” to mean “People who installed Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian, etc. themselves and religiously install updates”. OSS also includes things like the various forks and boutique distributions which started drifting behind, all of those insecure libraries where someone installed a copy of OpenSSL, libtiff/libpng/etc., or almost any PHP app, and never came back to update it.<p>This problem is only going to get worse as the IoT gold rush continues and all of these “Two EEs and a web developer” companies ship a device shortly before folding, being bought out, etc. and there&#x27;s no indication to the customer when it&#x27;s no longer safe to have that device on a network.<p>Note that this isn&#x27;t saying that open-source is insecure – the same problems routinely happen with commercial software, too – but rather that it&#x27;s not a magic wand for solving the problem. Apple ships updates promptly because their reputation depends on it, which is the exact same mechanism which keeps Debian, Red Hat, Ubuntu, etc. going, too, but that approach doesn&#x27;t work in the case where the real customer isn&#x27;t the person using the device. As long as Samsung keeps Verizon happy, they only care about the user experience to the extent that many people would choose to buy another not-Apple device instead of theirs.<p>Ultimately, I think we really need legal changes to ban corporate attempts to shirk liability for flaws in their products and sharp restrictions on the ability to prevent users from securing their own devices – something like a vendor being required to publish the full source, build toolchain, hardware unlocks, etc. if they go more than a couple months without releasing a patch for a known problem in a particular device.",1438005005

9955145,comment,9954684,9954905,0,0,dspillett,,,"Shared hosting is a mugs game these days and has been for a long time, both for the hosts and the users. The only way to compete on any scale other than &quot;hosting stuff for family & friends or your own clients&quot; is to be deliberately deceptive in this way. Another common trick is &quot;unlimited databases of any size (but we&#x27;ll limit I/O so much that it&#x27;ll never be practical to store more than some tens of Mb)&quot;.<p>I used to run a small host many years ago. I quickly got out of the business.<p>There are three classes of people still using shared hosting:<p>1. Those who know the game but to whom it really doesn&#x27;t matter: they have little content and/or it is of such niche interest that they are not going to be anywhere near the limits associated with &quot;unlimited&quot;. They are aware of the game and using a shared host is either habit or just the quickest way to put the files.scripts out there. They have little or no budget - as soon as they need to pay anything they&#x27;ll switch to a VPS (but can&#x27;t be bothered running one right now as they don&#x27;t need to immediately).<p>2. Those who don&#x27;t know any better and who have bought into the marketing of the other hosts. They will expect you to provide the same (or more) for the same (or less) that the other hosts are promising and when you tell them that you can&#x27;t they will be disappointed, sometimes incredulous, even occasionally <i>offended</i> (as if you telling them it is not possible to make money that way is insulting, i.e. telling them their expectations are wrong is tantamount to telling them they are stupid).<p>3. Those who know the game full well are and playing it to the max. They&#x27;ve already been pushed off several hosts for using too much of their &quot;unlimited&quot; resources and fully expect to get pushed off yours at some point too (though they&#x27;ll still kick up an almighty fuss when it does actually happen).<p>Class 1 won&#x27;t spend any money, class 2 and 3 will want to pay very little and will eventually try to kill your business via bad reviews when you let them go or otherwise don&#x27;t give them what they demand.",1438004976

Such goals are meaningless, because each and every one of us wants to simply be better. Does becoming a better programmer mean you understand the given technology better, that you code faster in a language of your choice, colaborate with others more efficiently?<p>You are talking about your career here so I&#x27;d approach the problem from the standpoint of the value you bring to the market. On a meta-level your general goal should be acquisition of such a skillset that would be valued and allow you gradually achieve such a high position that would secure your income for the years to come.<p>Going to a school certainly helps you limit the scope, time and effort you have to put into the task as well as it gives you a diploma that always could be of use. (The market is still unsaturated with coders of <i>any</i> level, but if the demand for manpower dropped a diploma could be important while competing for employment). Schools are also good about teaching more general problems such as math, algorithms and computability theory, these however have imho little use in front-end development.<p>Try asking people around you what things they think you should learn to perform better in the <i>specyfic</i> set of tasks you are dealing with on daily basis and focus on them. Your employer will be happy to hear you want to improve your skills.<p>Apart from that try learning something really challenging, something you really don&#x27;t like doing (assembly? scala?), or something fundamental like TCP/IP or SSH.

The viewing angles are carefully chosen, the colors and lights are more vibrant, the shapes of everyday objects are more varied and graceful, the people are better looking, etc. The end result is that you&#x27;re looking at a rough description of something that you want but don&#x27;t have.<p>You could achieve the same effect with a high resolution image, but then you need to make all the little details beautiful as well, which takes much more work. There are certainly high resolution paintings that manage to be as haunting and evocative as the best pixel art, for example Shan Qiao&#x27;s &quot;Story of the city&quot; (<a href=""https://www.artstation.com/artwork/story-of-the-city"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/story-of-the-city</a>), Nivanh Chantara&#x27;s &quot;Babiru 02&quot; (<a href=""https://www.artstation.com/artwork/babiru-02"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/babiru-02</a>), or pretty much anything on <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/backgroundart"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/backgroundart</a>.",1438003579

Say I have a requirement, &quot;I need a REST endpoint that gives me X information&quot;.<p>The fast approach is to just say &quot;Okay, this is getting information; that&#x27;s a GET. We&#x27;ve already been writing this in this language and framework, let me just stick a new endpoint in the router file that gets that info and returns it&quot;.<p>The slow approach is to say all of that, and then follow it with &quot;Okay. What happens if this information isn&#x27;t there? Can that happen? If something goes wrong, do I need to return a sensible error message along with the HTTP error code? Does the consumer understand a specific kind of error message, such that it will be displayed to the user? As part of getting X, are there any additional parameters that we need; i.e., is it enough to get -all- Xs for the call, or is the size of it likely to be enough to warrant getting just Xs that match (filtering criteria)? Does the DB need to be optimized for that sort of query?&quot; Note that agile -does- mean you probably don&#x27;t address all of those as part of this story; KISS, YAGNI, etc, still apply. But taking it slow means you -think- about those things.<p>What&#x27;s the difference, if it doesn&#x27;t lead to any change? Well, thinking about it means you likely cause any failures to fail gracefully, in a well defined, recognizable, predictable manner. It also likely means you&#x27;ve brought up those issues, and you can determine whether they should be tackled at all; you might be able to do them as part of this story if they&#x27;re small, or add some hooks such that it&#x27;ll be easy to add them later, but it might also lead to creating new stories, that get prioritized into the next sprint.<p>Now, while people argue you need to move fast and break things sometimes, I&#x27;d argue that taking things &#x27;slow&#x27; like that -is always better-. Why? Because if you take things slow, you can still choose not to do something. The overhead of just thinking about it, and then actively choosing to take the fastest path, is very, very small compared to just rushing in to do the fastest path. Maybe 10% extra or so. But as often as not, taking it slow will lead to you coming up with additional work that you really need to do; without it your app will fall over, or your users will get pissed off, or whatever. While that then feels slower (you are, after all, doing more), it&#x27;s getting things done that -need to be done-. If you&#x27;d taken the fast approach, you&#x27;d realize you need them later, but in hindsight would justify moving fast because &quot;well, we didn&#x27;t know that then, and we got features out the door&quot;. Sure, you didn&#x27;t know that then because you -didn&#x27;t pause to think about it-. You can&#x27;t claim that you couldn&#x27;t have predicted it, and moved to avoid it, because you never tried to predict it. If you -did- spend some time thinking, and fail to catch something, then you really couldn&#x27;t have predicted it, because you -tried- to. You&#x27;ve optimized for the best possible path as you can understand it at the time; taking the fastest path may or may not land you there, and you can&#x27;t know whether it was optimal.<p>In short, moving fast means defaulting to not doing the extra work; moving slow means thinking, and actively -deciding- what level of work needs to be done. You can be nearly as fast as &#x27;moving fast&#x27; (by thinking about it and deciding you don&#x27;t want to do the extra stuff), but you can also decide that certain tasks really need to be done, and that, while making you slower, leads to a better product.",1438002714

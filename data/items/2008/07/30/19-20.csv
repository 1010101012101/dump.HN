The problem is the length of time a copyright can be held. It was short, initially, with the intent of keeping people innovative. It's now been turned into a way to hold on to cash cows.",1217447922

Someone with money and equipment (the aforementioned ""industry"") suddenly was able to record something and make a profit on those who could not.<p>Soon, however, we invented ways to record sound cheaply, thus one didn't have to spend as much on recording/reproducing hardware, giving people ability to do it themselves, and the ""industry"" started to bitch about VCRs and cassette recorders.<p>Now we've come up with even cheaper way to record, copy and even manipulate (!) sound. And a way to distribute it for free.<p>The ""industry"" is clearly not needed anymore, there is no ""product"" behind it, just a bunch of useless ""distributors"" and ""promoters"". Why would we want to save THAT?<p>Nothing is going to happen to music, the music has been around for thousands of years, long before all these inventions took place, and the best musical creations happened without any help from the ""industry"".<p>We (engineers) gave them (the industry) an exclusive monopoly to charge for a short-lived privilege of storing and transporting sound, now we're taking it back.

You don't get longevity right now - nobody will be a hundred and fifty for a good 50 years, and that's a lot of technological change at today's rate.<p>What about the problem that all the things he discusses relating to compound interest, insurance and pension investments and so on rely on the economy ""continuing to grow"" forever and ever, which seems a bit of an unsustainable idea.<p>Also, he is arguing as if the longevity treatment will lead to a world full of handout-dependent frail unproductive elderly people. Aubrey de Gray particularly, is after life extension by reverting ongoing ageing and keeping people healthy and middle aged indefinitely. That is, not retired and on handouts and depending on young people to support them, but ""being"" young people themselves. The real goal of longevity is not a long retirement but a long vibrant life.<p>What about people who own their own homes by the time they are 50, invest for another 50 years until they are 100, then live off the interest - they wont be dependent on young workers to keep their pensions going (except to the extent of needing a permanently growing economy to pay interest :P). Pensions are only around because old people ""can't"" work today. I say ""can't"" in quotes, because if it came down to it a lot could with the help of good future telecomms kit or part time work (or powered exoskeletons or whatever).<p>It's a very poorly-considered scaremongering article and as such quite annoying. The author should go and read John Wyndham's ""Trouble With Lichen"", and then some De Gray, Kurzweil, Yudkowsky and as much general Sci-Fi as possible to broaden his/her perception of the kinds of futures that may be, so they don't get stuck with one world view.<p>Indefinitely long lived people could colonise Mars (and further) - what's a 6 month trip and 50 years of colony building then?<p>Or with some improved materials, Clarke style space elevator skyscrapers, or Asimov style undergroundscrapers or undersea dwellings.<p>Or any of the following somewhat plausible ideas could change everything - AI / effective neural enhancements / wearable computers where (user + wearable) > (unenhanced human) / useable genetically engineered bacteria / usable nanotechnology / etc.<p>Craig Venter is working on genetically engineered bacteria to convert plants -> fuel locally, on a small scale. Imagine owning a home and a fuel plant and a self harvesting farm with resiliant crops... you wouldn't need to work full time to live and that would free up partial jobs for younger people.<p>As they say, it's prudent to think about longevity before it happens.

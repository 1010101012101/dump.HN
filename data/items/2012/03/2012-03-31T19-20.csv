Upon registering as a tutor you would select your areas of expertise and take a few diagnostic tests, perhaps pulled from khan academy and other sites. You would be encouraged to buy a low cost usb writing pad to assist you in your teaching, and you would agree to accept no payment for your first 20 or so tutoring sessions. This is because you would be proving your abilities as a tutor to students who had agreed to do sessions with tutors of unproven ability (this would also serve as the free pricing tier). After each session the student would rate the tutor in several categories, allowing them to build up credibility and desirability among the students. Once they are proven the students who would like a more professional experience can submit reasonable payments before their session through stripe or some other simple payment system. The sessions look like a split screen with a video feed of the other person on one side and a virtual paper display on the other. Tutors can log in and do sessions with available students whenever they want, or students can subscribe to specific tutors at given times if both parties agree. I can see this having a problem with an initial lack of tutors/users and also a library of diagnostic tests would be difficult to build up since this idea isn't limited to standard subjects. I'd love to hear HN's ideas on this, thanks for reading.",1333223983

3781346,comment,3778158,3781329,3,0,tptacek,,,"I have no idea what you are trying to say here. This is an engineering discussion, not a dorm room debate.<p>What you've tried to argue here is that we should add new HTTP verbs to express ""this endpoint shouldn't allow cross-domain requests"". Or, more generally, that we should add HTTP features to allow browsers to prevent CSRF attacks.<p>But CSRF isn't a browser security problem. It isn't even necessarily a cross-domain problem! (CSRF is in that respect misnamed.) The specific changes you've suggested would drastically change the HTTP protocol but couldn't even theoretically solve the request forgery problem, not just because of intra-site CSRF but because your suggested locked-down HTTP requests would also break otherwise viable apps --- meaning that many apps couldn't use these features even if they wanted to, and would have to rely on something else for CSRF protection.<p>The fact is that having browsers police request validity just doesn't make sense. Even if they could do that, they still obviously have to rely on serverside signals to determine whether a request is or isn't valid. If the serverside knows a request isn't valid, it already has the means to block it! Why on earth would the server punt this to the browser?<p>Your suggestions have the appearance of not being familiar with how CSRF protection works in apps today. It is almost a one-liner in many modern frameworks.",1333223811

The InfoQ essay makes a fundamental mistake:<p>Being an introvert isn't the same as needing to work alone.<p>Introverts gain energy from focusing on the ""internal world"" of thoughts and ideas. Extroverts gain energy from focusing on the ""external world"" of socializing and interactions.<p>So, as an introvert, I can do just fine as a public speaker, consultant, and yes, pair programmer and Agile team member, because those activities are focused on thoughts and ideas. (I don't do so well at parties or conference ice-breakers, and that's fine.)<p>The other error I see in the InfoQ essay is that it conflates ""Agile"" with ""decision by committee."" It's true that Agile teams work in, well, teams, but that's not the same as everybody being involved in every decision. Team members on a high-functioning team know who on the team is best at what, and they automatically delegate everyday decisions to the people most qualified to make those decisions.<p>It does take a while for a team to reach this level of capability, and the early stages of team growth can be uncomfortable and difficult, often with too many meetings, but that doesn't mean that ""Agile"" == ""decision by committee.""

It's a functional language. Though, it's also imperative. And object-oriented. It favors immutability, except that mutability is just as easy (or hard). It has adopted the actor model. But it has also adopted all of Java's concurrency constructs. It was designed as a very practical language. And it's also a research language with some experimental features. Oh, I almost forgot: it is meant to be a high-performance language. But it's also designed to build DSLs. It's a very opinionated language in the sense that it's opinion is that all opinions are valid.<p>So I must say that any difficulty you may have understanding what Scala is trying to be is due to no fault of Scala itself. It's very simple, really (well, to be precise, there are different tiers of simplicity in Scala, but I can assure you that each tier is quite simple once you've mastered all the design decisions, and category theory, that fully, consistently and self-sufficiently define the simplicity of the respective tier).",1333222161

Try to get involved in a project that is from scratch, that way it won't be an issue.<p>I'll share my own story, having gone thru just this recently.<p>First I went thru Michael Hartl's tutorial back in Dec:<p><a href=""http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book</a><p>I believe it was in 3.0 at the time, now been updated to 3.2.  No matter.  I found a local business who needed something done but had never done more than Wordpress sites.  I offerred my services pro-bono w/ a small equity share on the condition I could be mentored by a very sr. guy.  At first they said ""no, we want just one engineer solo on this"".  I said good luck with that and they got back to me two weeks later with a very sr. guy to give direction.<p>Beyond Hartl's excellent tutorial, which in printed form is probably 500 pages or so and will take maybe 40 hours of dedicated work, I highly recommend the Rails guides themselves.  Just the getting started guide alone is chock full of info on getting a basic blogging platform together.  In doing this project I have reviewed the majority of the Rails guides back and forth, read countless Stack Overflow threads, blog posts, rails casts, etc, and generally spend about 20-30 hours per week above and beyond my day job.  The magic in this is that you will have to filter through a bunch of examples that may be several years old and are targeted at various versions of Rails, so you will sort of distill the differences in versions/idioms by osmosis in a way. If I had to take on a 2.3 code base at this point I doubt it would hinder me much.<p>Where do things stand now?  Well, my current project is about to hit customer beta and my mentor has asked me to come along with him on another project for a client in NYC.  Also I applied to a local early stage startup and despite having only 3 months under my belt they're considering bringing me on (they were looking for someone with 3+ years, but I learn quick and am very motivated :).  If I get the job I'll likely take it (it's something I really believe in, potentially world changing stuff), say goodbye to the Windows enterprise world forever, and forgo doing further contract work for the time being as I won't likely have the time.  My main interest now is getting good as quickly as possible.  Long term, maybe this company will take off and I'll have the time of my life, maybe I'll strike out on my own startup, or maybe I too will pull $150/hr on contract.  Who knows.",1333221750

Aside from my device being broken, I primarily switched due to the app ecosystem developed around Apple. As an (aspiring) UX professional, I felt I was missing out on a lot. I think the app eco system is a key point for most (and for a lot of consumers I think the difference between Android and Apple is negligible). Going from a BB to iPhone has me missing some of the ""power user"" features a BlackBerry affords. Maybe I should have gone Android<p>Some things about BlackBerry. The keyboard is superior to any other keyboard out there. The BlackBerry is perfectly adequate for lightweight users and IMO a much better messaging device (not strictly because of BBM, but because of battery life as well). RIM is in a weird place due to their enterprise service offerings, software and hardware. wrt Messaging, I think RIM missed out on an interesting acquisition opportunity. Instead of embracing and potentially folding in Kik to its BBM offerings, RIM decided to fight them. Folding in a service like Kik could have been great, I think.",1333221155
3781233,comment,3780963,3780963,14,0,mhartl,,,"<i>Note</i>: For the purposes of this discussion, ""accessible"" means ""accessible via mass assignment"". See <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3781317"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3781317</a>.<p>The change in Rails 3.2.3 that will likely affect the most people is a new default setting in <i>config/application.rb</i> for newly generated applications. By default, Active Record is now configured to throw exceptions any time an attribute not included in <i>attr_accessible</i> is included in a mass assignment:<p><pre><code>    .\n    .\n    .\n    module SampleApp\n      class Application < Rails::Application\n        .\n        .\n        .\n        config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true\n        .\n        .\n        .\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\n(Exactly what this means is explained below.)<p>The model generators have also been updated to include an <i>attr_accessible</i> line. Unfortunately, if you include all of the attributes in the call to <i>rails generate</i> at the command line, they will all be accessible by default, which kind of defeats the purpose. For example, if you type<p><pre><code>    $ rails generate model User name:string admin:boolean\n</code></pre>\nyou'll get<p><pre><code>    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      attr_accessible :name, :admin\n    end\n</code></pre>\nwhich probably isn't what you want: chances are that the <i>admin</i> attribute shouldn't be accessible. To prevent security holes, I therefore <i>strongly</i> recommend writing explicit tests for all inaccessible attributes (see below).<p>To see the effects of the new default, consider a User model with an <i>admin</i> attribute <i>not</i> included in the <i>attr_accessible</i> list:<p><pre><code>    class User < ActiveRecord::Base\n      attr_accessible :name, :email, :password, :password_confirmation\n      .\n      .\n      .\n    end\n</code></pre>\nWith the new default configuration, code like<p><pre><code>    User.new(admin: true)\n</code></pre>\nwill raise an<p><pre><code>    ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Error\n</code></pre>\nexception. You can test for this (in RSpec) as follows:<p><pre><code>    describe ""accessible attributes"" do\n      it ""should not allow access to admin"" do\n        expect do\n          User.new(admin: true)\n        end.should raise_error(ActiveModel::MassAssignmentSecurity::Error)\n      end    \n    end\n</code></pre>\nFor more details, see the latest version of the <i>Ruby on Rails Tutorial</i> (<a href=""http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railstutorial.org/book?version=3.2</a>).",1333221145

I've started to dive into an existing code-base, and I honestly just can't grok what Scala is trying to be.<p>I think my biggest issue is that the language is so syntactically flexible (verbose?) that I simply have no idea what is a language construct and what isn't.<p>For instance the code is littered with stuff that looks like:<p>val something = some_obj open_!;<p>Is open_! just a method (literally some_obj.open_!) or is ""_!"" some sort of language construct, because underscores are special sometimes, like with unary_ for instance (or not.. it really just depends).<p>At first glance the 'almost any method can behave like an operator' stuff is really cool, although as I learned about alarm bells where ringing all over the place. In the hands of even an actually competent programmer it's going to be abused well beyond the utility you get out of it.<p>It took 30 seconds of looking at existing code to find obvious examples of it. Why is it so evil to clearly denote a method as being an actual method?<p>Then there is the whole ""is this functional or not"" madness. It reminds of PERL in that respect. You can accomplish the same tasks in a bunch of different ways.<p>I guess I'm not terribly impressed. It actually makes me long for the simplicity of C. If you want static typing Scala (and readability adverse type inference system) seems like a really bad choice. At least at the point I'm at about a week into this stuff.<p>At the end of the day give me the beauty of C, the explicitness of Python, or a much more complete functional language like Clojure. I don't want a hybrid of all of those that seems to create a whole new set of weaknesses and big-time issues.

38449,comment,38447,38447,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think it is outdated. It is fairly complicated, but what really annoys me is the ""entity"" problem. That vision of passing a document through a series of XSLT filters does not work, because the defined entities get transformed after the first pass (ie something like &#160; don't remember correct syntax). Maybe I just couldn't figure out how to make it work though - which leads back to point #1, too complicated.",1185996316

Hone your technical skills, particularly in the area you hope to be working in.<p>When I joined my employer, I figured I'd make sure I gave them 2 years of solid work, then I'd start doing side-projects and if it looked like one of them had promise, I'd quit and pursue it.  So I purposely did my best to work on absolutely commercially useless stuff for the first year.   I learned a whole lot about compilers, a whole lot about type systems and purely functional data structures, a whole lot about Haskell and Scheme, but very little about dynamic languages or the libraries available for them.  I got some practical knowledge from my job, but it turned out to be less transferable than I'd hoped for.<p>As a result, when a friend came knocking with ""Hey, you wanna start a startup"" after only a year, I was far less familiar with the technology we'd be using than I would've liked.  I was pretty fluent in two webapp technologies (PHP and JSF) that I knew I <i>didn't</i> want to use, but didn't have much practical experience in Rails or the Python frameworks that I <i>did</i> want to use.  And knowing how to design and implement a programming language doesn't do too much good when you just want to use one.",1185995649

Or had a JMP command that was distance limited (often to +/- 32k).<p>Effectively, sharding takes advantage of the locality of information.  As soon as you need information outside of that locale, you need to make a more expensive request.",1185995264

Dubbed U2F (Universal 2nd Factor), the consumer-facing side of this initiative will be a USB dongle called the YubiKey Neo. Built to Google’s specifications by security specialist Yubico, the YubiKey Neo is a small, durable and driverless device that requires no battery. Plugged into your computer’s USB port it will add a second, highly secure layer of verification when you point Google’s Chrome browser to your Gmail or Google Docs account. You’ll initiate the login by typing your username and a simple PIN. The browser will then communicate directly with the YubiKey Neo, using encrypted data, to authorize account access. With U2F verification, if someone wanted to login surreptitiously to your account, he or she would need to know your username and PIN while simultaneously having physical possession of that specific YubiKey Neo.&quot;<p>Furthermore, they had Regina Dugan, former DARPA director and now their VP of Engineering, Advanced Technology and Projects, on stage at All Things Digital in 2013 talking about electric tattoos and edible passwords which would turn your whole body into an authentication token with a 18bit ESG light signal.

Before we start talking about lack of features or compromises, just look at how much they charge for incremental memory. Just $20 for 8GB extra. Smartphones makers are slowly accepting commodity pricing and I hope they realize that skinning Android isn&#x27;t always a value add.<p>Cool new features like fingerprint reader sure catch the fancy of those waiting to upgrade their phone.

It allows me to tie all kinds of languages and frameworks together seamlessly.<p>Even though I could do it with Go, I let nginx do the SSL termination.

What that <i>actually</i> means is that the rate of delivery is going to start getting choked much sooner, and it&#x27;s peaked as of 2005 with a bit of a bumpy plateau since.  Oil fuels 95% of all transporation, which in Richard Heinberg&#x27;s eloquent turn of phrase is the heart of commerce.<p>I could go on about oil exploration capex (Steve Kopits), fracking well depletion rates, and a slew of other stuff, but you probably don&#x27;t want to hear about it.<p>You&#x27;re welcome to visit <a href=""http://reddit.com/r/dredmorbius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reddit.com/r/dredmorbius</a> if you like though.",1400314387

As a libertarian, I&#x27;d argue that the free market is better than government at deciding what needs to be automated. Minimum wages effectively impose a tax on human labor which in turn artificially incentivizes automation. Basic income might suffer from the same problem to some degree (by disincentivizing people to do lower paid jobs) but at least, it would accomplish the stated goal of minimum wages (that is, helping the more needy).",1400314072

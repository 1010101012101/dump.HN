2448629,comment,2448455,2448455,74,0,rivalis,,,"This is dubious; the whole ""higher education vs. entrepreneurship"" discourse is a false dichotomy. What has happened is that capitalism has degraded most peoples' perceptions of the goals of higher education: they think it is meant to give them skills for a job or something. Higher education is meant to transform the student's ability to think, such that they can contribute truly new knowledge to society. This often involves less than spectacular monetary compensation for long and painful hours.<p>The tension between the job training mission imposed by a capitalist society and the more traditional humanist ""transformational"" mission has watered down the educational system.<p>As someone who chose education for the sake of education with my eyes wide open and not expecting much in the way of dollars afterward, I applaud the decisions of entrepreneurs to recognize the mission confusion of colleges and simply leave.<p>Institutions should be like UNIX programs: they should do one thing and do it well.

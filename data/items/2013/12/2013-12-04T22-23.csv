6851105,comment,6850591,6850591,6,0,TacticalCoder,,,"I remember I started to use Linux in the early to mid- nineties. Back then home networking equipment was a bit too expensive for me (basically I was student-broke), so I did set up a local network between my &quot;big&quot; Linux desktop computer and my small laptop using PLIP (that is: IP over the parallel line interface IIRC). Then I&#x27;d launch an X11 server on the laptop but display on it a session from a user on the desktop. So both my brother and I could surf simultaneously from the &quot;fast&quot; machine. As I remember it things the network was slow, but I clearly remember that it worked. We had our first Internet connection (dial-up) and we were &quot;sharing it&quot; and surfing simultaneously (using Mosaic?) for hours and hours.<p>Later on I&#x27;ve configured similar setups so that several devs could use older PCs to run fat IDEs from the one fast machine to older PCs (it was funny the day I yanked the power cord of the fast machine, interrupting everybody ; )<p>Up to this day I still love the fact that it&#x27;s trivial for one local user (if you allow it) to run programs in the visual X11 session of another user. I&#x27;m using several browsers from unrelated user accounts: one only for my personal GMail / Google Docs, one only for browsing, one only for my professional GMail account, etc. That&#x27;s a feature I use daily and, for my use, I think it&#x27;s easier (and faster) than running several VMs.<p>You can also run simultaneously several X11 session, for example at different sizes (say one at 1920x1200, another one at 1280x800, etc.).<p>I&#x27;d really miss these features if they were to go away: I hope the newer Wayland and Mir etc. will still allow one &quot;user&quot; to display graphical apps on the display of another user.",1386197872

6851102,comment,6849716,6849716,1,0,sukuriant,,,"I&#x27;ve been reading the comments and something stuck out to me. It&#x27;s not uncommon for people to have 20/15 vision with corrective lenses. The lenses don&#x27;t zoom the image in, as far as I can tell; and so, the 20/20 number we often come up with has nothing to do with the resolution of the eye as a sensor, but more to do with the focusing power of the lens. It might be more useful to consider 20/15 or 20/10 as what humans can see, since the lens is whats failing on the eye, not the sensor in the back. To that end, too, it&#x27;d be nice to see some really good glass to mitigate the lenses failings there. There are charts that relate lens sharpness to sensor acuity. As long as the lens sharpness is approximately equal or better, we should have an accurate result.<p>Also, I have 20/15 vision with contacts in and both eyes open (weaker with just one eye open, as is normal); and, when I can see letters, I can see them pretty well defined. I&#x27;m not sure how much of that is mental post-processing, though.",1386197858

Then we can have an intelligent conversation about the relative advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches.<p>Also, it seems like this need to split everything right vs left is more characteristic of the older generation who are less familiar with technology.

But we still don&#x27;t know if the Jigsaw module system will be made available for all consumers or just for the JDK itself.<p>> If your type was written by someone who didn&#x27;t care to implement Comparable, bad luck! - If the type has a Comparable implementation which differs from what you need, bad luck, too! - You need the type to be comparable in multiple ways? Again, bad luck!<p>Um, you&#x27;ve totally missed the point. Go and have another look.<p>And sure, since you bring it up, we can certainly add a version of max() that accepts a comparator function. It would be a method of Iterable, probably.<p>And sorry, but I can&#x27;t imagine why I would want or need typeclasses to solve that problem. Sure, I <i>could</i> use typeclasses, if I were a solution in search of a problem ;)<p>> I&#x27;m not sure that there is a large difference.<p>You can&#x27;t abstract over tuple and function -arity in Scala. So yes, there&#x27;s a big difference. Look at the definition of compose() in Ceylon.<p>>  and performance (no pointer chasing, all values are just a method call away).<p>At the VM level, tuples are represented as arrays. So there is no real performance penalty.<p>> Anyway, if one wanted tuples-as-linked-lists, one could just use Shapeless&#x27; HList library, which has a few benefits over Ceylon&#x27;s tuples, too, as far as I see:<p>In Ceylon, without any macro library, you can write:<p><pre><code>    value tuple = [1, &quot;str&quot;, 42.31];\n    String str = tuple[1]; //totally possible in Ceylon\n</code></pre>\nSeriously dude, _just try it out_, you&#x27;re desperately searching for reasons to not like this thing! But it really has cool stuff to offer you. Give it a fair chance!<p>Sure, _of course_ you&#x27;re going to find stuff in Scala that you can&#x27;t do in Ceylon. Scala is one of the most huge and complex and feature-rich languages _ever_! But you&#x27;ll also find plenty of stuff you can do in Ceylon that you can&#x27;t do in Scala, if you care to look.",1386197818

Eyes also come pre-packaged in a format that allows for quite accurate determination of distance at no extra charge. While cameras have a slightly broader spectrum, eyes work in a far greater range of brightness - and seeing in the near dark is far more useful than seeing the LED on the end of a remote. Eyes are perfectly mobile, and don&#x27;t require external power. Eyes have a much faster traverse and can move to and focus on a target much more quickly. If you&#x27;re turning, eyes will give you a stable image of the world around you to help keep your reference - cameras will just give you motion blur. Eyes are very difficult to replace, admittedly, but they have pretty astonishing self-healing characteristics and last for decades of constant use - in the rain, snow, desert heat, even underwater (though admittedly the image isn&#x27;t great).

I mean, obviously, don&#x27;t make it unscalable on purpose, but your most important priority is to launch a product that works.  Your first 100 users or so won&#x27;t notice poor scalability, and Rails is easy enough to scale wider at the app server that you should be able to get to profitability before having to worry too much about it.<p>On the other end, if you spend three times longer building a scalable application out of the gate and don&#x27;t get any customers, or lose first-mover advantage, then all that work was a waste of time, when you could have been launched and billing well before.<p>ActiveRecord isn&#x27;t notoriously efficient, but so long as appropriate indexes are in place on the database, tends of millions of records shouldn&#x27;t cause too much of a problem, unless you&#x27;re putting an inordinate amount of those records on each page, or have odd query patterns.<p>The one good bit of scalability advice I can give you for a large dataset like that is &quot;Don&#x27;t use the database for searching data.&quot;  It took me years to learn that one, which is sad, because SOLR is so easy to drop into a project, and is so well suited to the task that it&#x27;s just silly to not use it.  The exact usage patterns of when to query and when to search will depend on the application, but use SOLR, or something like it, where it makes sense to do so.<p>Beyond that, make a product that works, and isn&#x27;t too ugly.

This is not always the case - sometimes the purpose of a rank like this is to measure something absolute, rather than relative.<p>For example, what would happen if every restaurant in NYC cleaned up their kitchens and used such safe practices that they <i>all</i> met the requirements to get an &quot;A&quot; grade on their Dept. of Health inspection? In that case, I would say that they are all safe to eat at, and they all deserve &quot;A&quot; ratings. However according to you, this would mean the scale was broken and we should grade them on a normal curve, giving B&#x27;s and C&#x27;s and even F&#x27;s to perfectly-safe-but-not-quite-as-clean restaurants. This just doesn&#x27;t make sense - if you meet the requirements for an &quot;A&quot;, it&#x27;s not fair to be put out of business just because someone else spent more time polishing their restaurant floor.<p>I think school grades should be treated similarly - as an &quot;absolute&quot; measure of whether or not the student learned the curriculum, not a relative measure of how well they performed against their peers. No one should be punished for the &quot;bad luck&quot; of being placed in a class full of wicked-smart students.

It was a difficult decision and involved multiple factors, but part of it had to do with my discomfort regarding the ethical issues of search-engine advertising. I found it hard to garner support for my viewpoint when discussing my decision with others, and it was striking to see how many people consider search advertising to be relatively benign and not worth turning down a job over.

Ceylon&#x27;s module system supplants both OSGi _and_ Maven. It&#x27;s not just an alternative to OSGi, it&#x27;s a whole architecture for modularity.<p>> I tried to do that, but it looks like you don&#x27;t have an equivalent to javadoc/scaladoc with the standard library docs publicly available?<p><a href=""https://modules.ceylon-lang.org/modules/ceylon.language/1.0.0/doc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://modules.ceylon-lang.org/modules/ceylon.language/1.0....</a><p>> I don&#x27;t think you can do that without higher kinded types.<p>Correct, we don&#x27;t have type constructor polymorphism in the official language, and even if we did, we wouldn&#x27;t use it for this particular problem.

F22 and Tuple2, Tuple3, ... Tuple22. That to me is just rubbish.<p>Looking at what you did with Tuples (basically a linked list), I&#x27;m not sure that there is a large difference.\nScala&#x27;s approach seems to be more in line of YAGNI (if you need that 523-Tuple, you should think a bit about your data model) and performance (no pointer chasing, all values are just a method call away).<p>Anyway, if one wanted tuples-as-linked-lists, one could just use Shapeless&#x27; HList library, which has a few benefits over Ceylon&#x27;s tuples, too, as far as I see:<p><pre><code>  val hlist = 1 :: &quot;str&quot; :: 42.31 :: &#x27;sym :: HNil\n  val str: String = hlist(1) // Not possible in Ceylon, afaik</code></pre>",1386196765

But it seems incredibly naive to give corporations the same treatment.<p>Read the actual promise[1].<p>The promise only covers patent claims from Microsoft on those technologies, and only if you&#x27;re not engaged in any patent lawsuit with them. So, if you&#x27;re some random company that happens to encroach on Microsoft&#x27;s territory in another area, but you happened to use Mono, they can strike at your usage of Mono due to your work in another area.<p>Automotive? Health? Entertainment? &quot;Social&quot;? Telecommunications? Advertising? Resource planning? Imaging/mapping? Security? Aeronautics? Anything related to computing?<p>All those and more are areas that Microsoft works on. I can&#x27;t imagine any legal team being able to assert that their company will _never_ use Microsoft IP in any area - it&#x27;s just too vast.<p>Example: You use Mono to implement some coordination software for networking gear - that sounds &quot;safe&quot;. Microsoft then publishes research and obtains patents on their own work on networking (already done) from Azure and MSR (or they buy some large dead company&#x27;s portfolio). Microsoft now has IP all over your area of choice, and as soon as there&#x27;s any fight, you lose your Promise over Mono and now have a ton more claims to defend. Oops.<p>This isn&#x27;t really even cynicism - it&#x27;s spelled out very clearly in the promise.<p>Edit: In the Google Android .NET issue: Yes, Google can go use .NET for Android, no problem. Until Google gets in a fight over a plethora of other patents (say, advertising or other phone related patents). At that point, Google loses its promise for Mono and MS has a lucrative ground to gain.<p>Also, copyright issues are NOT included in the Community Promise. So MS still wins by making APIs copyrightable. They might extend the CP to cover copyright, but those copyright issues are still there as soon as someone fights MS over anything else. Totally strengthens MS&#x27;s position.<p>As far as .NET on Android - OF COURSE, MS won&#x27;t &quot;stop&quot; that. That&#x27;d be a major win for MS and hurt Oracle/Java. The .NET port would fall under the agreement, but I&#x27;ve already demonstrated how quickly that agreement can roll back. Google adopting .NET is a good technical move, but gives MS a massive advantage.<p>That said, app developers using MonoDroid are probably reasonably safe so long the apps they make are of relatively low strategic value to MS.

Things like the type of entity of the debtor company (was it a corporation? a partnership? a sole proprietorship?) may determine who ultimately has to foot the bill, as well as the structure of the sale (e.g. the acquiror may have merged the target company into itself, which generally means it assumes the target company&#x27;s liabilities; or the acquiror may have purchased only the target company&#x27;s assets, leaving the liabilities behind with the company).  These are questions your lawyer can help you figure out.<p>Independently of the question of liability, however, when a creditor has sufficient evidence to establish that it is owed a debt by someone, the burden generally shifts to that someone (to the alleged debtor) to show that he&#x27;s free and clear of debt.<p>Bottomline: I would consult an attorney, and show him your correspondences with the company, including the correspondences with the purported acquiror.

Take, for instance, most socialist, social-democratic, or Left parties in contemporary Europe. They advocate for the state to take an active role in making space for democracy (for instance by legislating codetermination in the workplace) and de-commodifying labor to protect the working classes from capital. True, many leftists -- especially those in the communist and anarchist left -- have the long-term goal of abolishing the state, but that doesn&#x27;t mean the institutions of the state cannot play a role in advancing <i>some</i> of the goals of the left in the interim. Even Nikolai Bukharin did not deny this.<p>That&#x27;s what the author is arguing here -- that the state should not be ruled out <i>tout court</i> as a potential site of engagement for those seeking to realize the promises of radical democracy.

Although given that it did appear, your explanation seems like a plausible explanation of how it spread and led to the rapid progress we have seen since.<p>A boring answer to this question is that it was simple incremental changes driven by random mutations and natural selection (eg. evolution). For example, we might have started to occasional plant the seeds of plants as we found them, which could become us regularly doing so. Then we might have started moving the seeds to more central locations, and eventually arrive at agriculture as we know it today. These adaptations may have started before homo-sapiens. If it happened long enough before (so that there is another species with a common ancestor that did this), we could check this by looking for agricultural tendencies in species related to us (If anyone is aware of research on this hypothesis, please post).<p>A more interesting hypothesis is that agriculture was the result of an abiotic change. Instead of gradually developing agricultural tendencies, we &#x27;immediately&#x27; became agricultural following some other event, such as a change in climate.

6850617,comment,6850051,6850051,6,0,exelius,,,"I read this entire article, and I&#x27;m still not sure what it really said. IMO the author falls into the same trap as most of the media, casting people as &quot;leftist&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot; when most take a liberal position on some issues and not on others.<p>What&#x27;s really happening, in my opinion, is that there are people who are happy with the status quo. These people are usually doing pretty well (see Koch bros or startup millionaires.) They are politically inclined to believe in things that are in their own self-interest: for many tech geeks, that is the &quot;freedom&quot; of information because it sustains the belief that they can personally profit from such a situation.<p>You saw a lot of this with Google. For a long time, they were all about freedom of information and open source software because their mission statement is to &quot;organize the world&#x27;s information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;. A key part of doing that is having <i>access</i> to all of the world&#x27;s information. But now that they have proprietary information that is in their interest to keep to themselves, that tune of openness and transparency is changing a bit (see Google+, et al).<p>Many tech folks have the same thoughts about government regulation. &quot;If only HIPAA didn&#x27;t exist, I could create a universal medical records solution!&quot; Nevermind that if the regulation didn&#x27;t exist, someone would have done it a long time ago: tech people see government regulation as a limiting factor in their potential for greatness.<p>It&#x27;s not about &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, it&#x27;s about individuals who believe many different things for many different reasons. To call out &quot;cyberlibertarians&quot; as a unified group is disingenuous at best: net neutrality is a classic case where this falls apart. The cyberlibertarian believes in additional government regulation on telecommunications not out of a belief that government regulation is a good thing, but because they fear the loss of a profitable market that belongs to technologists. It&#x27;s special-interest politics at its finest.",1386194427

So I use just one Ubuntu lts VM with docker backed by zfs.  That way, I can ssh to it and predictably recreate any number of isolated environments.  Way faster than vagrant and still provides isolation, although docker could be driven by it.  There&#x27;s always a need for some sort of deploy/configuration mgmt to bootstrap to speed up testing and reduce tiny difference gotchas.  The other good things are that it doesn&#x27;t sacrifice osx usability, no reboot is needed and it doesn&#x27;t require repartitioning.",1386194414

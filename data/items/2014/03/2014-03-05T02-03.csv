7344969,comment,7340152,7341639,2,0,ebiester,,,"1. Let&#x27;s review what we need for most web application, at minimum.<p>-- Some way to parse URLs coming into the system and route to the correct code that handles the response to that request.\n-- Some way to marshal and unmarshal form, request parameters, and more recently JSON.\n-- Some way to return HTML, after we have done what we need to considering the inputs we received. \n-- Some way to handle cookies. We probably also want a convenience layer so that we can have some sort of session to make authentication and authorization easier.\n-- Some way to interface with a more fixed storage, usually some form of a database. It would be nice to have a set of convenience methods to handle prepared statements. \n-- It would be nice to have some sort of way to escape text going to and from the fixed storage to help prevent XSS attacks.\n-- It would be nice to have a way to conveniently handle CSRF attacks.<p>Now, we could have a library for each one, or maybe 20. But that means every new project, we&#x27;re making 7 (at a minimum) libraries, evaluating them for security, keeping on top of security updates for 7 projects, and learning 7 (or more) fundamental libraries each time we come on to another team because someone made different choices. On top of that, we&#x27;ve written glue code on top of this all to make our lives livable. The current state of code ownership means that we probably can&#x27;t take this from employer to employer, so we&#x27;ll have to write it all over again, or learn someone else&#x27;s glue code with its own idiosyncrasies.<p>All for things that matter quite a bit, but I&#x27;d prefer a single good implementation over having to search for the 7 best. Further, what happens when one of these projects goes dormant? It&#x27;s easy to rip everything out if you&#x27;ve written your code modularly, but what about that junior programmer&#x27;s code from before you were there?<p>And are we supposed to thrust this all on a junior programmer who is just starting out? That&#x27;s how PHP happened. ;) Not every programmer is gifted with a good sense of architecture, and most frameworks at least enforce a Not-Terrible architecture. When taking over someone else&#x27;s code, this can be a very good thing.<p>Frameworks, as massively coupled as they are, have some distinct advantages for getting things done in 95% of systems. If you&#x27;re running a system for which the defaults don&#x27;t work, a framework isn&#x27;t right for you. That&#x27;s fine. Depending on how far out you are from the opinions, you can either cobble together your own solution or write it from scratch. But for most use cases, there are more advantages to that massively coupled system than disadvantages.",1393988310

7344946,comment,7344677,7344677,10,0,etrevino,,,"The problem here is simple: working hard isn&#x27;t enough.  If you can&#x27;t pull all A&#x27;s, get good test scores, and great recommendations, then you can&#x27;t have graduate school.  Obviously it&#x27;s unfair, in large part because someone wealthier won&#x27;t have to work to survive and can concentrate on his or her studies.  The converse of that, though, is when things get hard and the rubber hits the road the student will have some margin of error.  The author of this piece has none, as he admits.  That makes him a liability to an academic system that requires professors to make many of their graduate students slave labor hours so that they can publish at an appropriate level.<p>I&#x27;ve been to the highest levels of grad school and had to leave because of personal problems.  There&#x27;s nothing quite so painful as being told that your spouse&#x27;s terminal illness has little to no bearing on your examining committee&#x27;s opinion of you.  (n.b., I was in a European school, so I couldn&#x27;t take more than a three year leave of absence before presenting and defending my thesis.  My examiners could have given me another year, but they refused, saying that my spouse wasn&#x27;t exactly going to get <i>better</i> during that span)<p>This is all utterly unfair, but the sad fact of the matter is that graduate school isn&#x27;t for the author.  I don&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s an unrealistic dream, I mean that it&#x27;s not going to give a rat&#x27;s ass about the author&#x27;s life situation and grad school will treat him like shit when he has to take time to deal with very real life problems that academics tend to gloss over.  The author would be better served by avoiding grad school for now and establishing himself financially.  Good professional experience will counteract many of his GPA shortcomings (and most schools will ignore those if he has professional experience).  When he&#x27;s in a position to get a <i>fully-funded</i> position in grad school, only then should he go, because only then will he be able to commit himself 100% to his studies.",1393987926

7344907,comment,7340810,7343571,2,0,vaporizer,,,"The social aspects of vaporizers probably depends on who you hang with.  Everyone who I regularly get high with strictly uses a vaporizer when we are hanging out (or occasionally shares edibles).  Not a lot of smoking going on.  Of course, I am in my mid-30&#x27;s and have friends of the same age or older, and most of these friends have stable jobs, such that spending $250+ on a vaporizer is a no-brainer.<p>The verb &quot;vape&quot; is what is commonly used with the people I know.  It&#x27;s not show-offy if vaporizing is commonplace.  This is more recent, and I just said &quot;use a vaporizer&quot; in the past if I wanted to be specific.<p>Personally, I own both a non-portable vaporizer that can fill bags (Herbelaire) and a portable vaporizer (Pax).  Both are used frequently and are easy to share with friends.  I still smoke, but that is only maybe 10% of the time.  I&#x27;ve been vaping for the last 17 years, starting with a home-made vaporizer made using a soldering iron.<p>As for alcohol:  I enjoy it, but I rarely have the desire to drink it for it&#x27;s intoxicating effects lately.  I really enjoy the taste of beer (and wine is good too), but it&#x27;s becoming rare that I actually want to drink one.  What changed is that I started getting back in shape and exercising frequently (well, moderately).  Due to being a new parent, I often get my exercise around 9pm-10pm as that is the only time that works for me.  That means many nights, alcohol is just not an option.  Also, I have been fairly consistent in eliminating unhealthy foods (I can count the number of times I have a sugary dessert in a month on one hand), and I&#x27;ve started to see beer as unnecessary calories.  The fact that I lost enough weight to stop snoring is just affirmation that I should stick with this.  I&#x27;ll save drinking beer for social situations, rather than something I have with dinner.",1393987454

7344903,comment,7344292,7344292,12,0,FD3SA,,,"Representative democracy never worked. The reason is that politicians are not held accountable to their constituents once in office.<p>They run on a statistically validated marketing platform designed to win a strategic number of votes in each region, resulting in their election. However, once in office, there is no apparatus that keeps them accountable to their promises. This a feature, not a bug, of representative democracy. Time and time again, it is very clear that politicians run on a platform for the masses, but enact policies for the elite. Noam Chomsky has written extensively on this issue.<p>There is only one universal currency: power. This not only applies to individuals within a country, but also international relations. Weaker people will always be subject to the tyranny of the powerful, much like weaker countries constantly are at the whim of superpowers.<p>The rational counter-strategy to prevent this abuse is to limit individual power. While modern democracies succeed very well in limiting individual political power, they fail spectacularly in limiting financial power. As a result, financial power runs the local, national and international political arenas at the expense of its citizens. This is a natural consequence of capitalism.<p>It is accepted as gospel that capitalism is the &quot;least worst&quot; economic system. But this is a very shallow observation. What makes capitalism unique is that it completely unleashes the natural human tendencies of status competition by allowing mass accumulations of wealth. The result is exactly what we have today: the quest for wealth at any expense, without any guiding principles.<p>Is it really a testament to our transcendence that we produce millions of tons of consumer waste, because we can afford to? The problems with capitalism and democracy can both be solved simultaneously by understanding their limitations. Democracy and capitalism both need guiding principles to temper their inherently destabilizing tendencies. Accumulation of wealth or power for their own sake becomes fatally toxic to any nation.<p>Which guiding principles can serve this purpose? Sadly, history shows that nationalism and war have been the most successful. These principles prey upon fear to generate  \na temporary sense of unity and drive. But what if there was another way to do the same thing, but with hope instead of fear?<p>Personally, I hope that the guiding principle of the 21st century will be the pursuit of knowledge in the form of scientific research. A society with research as its goal would have an eternal national challenge, which would inspire its citizens from birth to learn and contribute to society. This would also produce an extremely informed citizenry which would be very difficult to brainwash or intimidate.<p>Lastly, with automation destroying the notion of “jobs” by severely favoring capital over labor in factors of production, this new society will be poised to prosper by giving citizens an incentive to pursue education and training while living off a basic income.<p>...Or perhaps I should stop watching Star Trek.",1393987386

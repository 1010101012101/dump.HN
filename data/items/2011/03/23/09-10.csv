2358728,comment,2357195,2357825,0,0,ErrantX,,,"PHPFog fucked up security, that's a given. And they should be thinking carefully on the lessons learned from that.<p>But your post seems to imply that the kids who did this have no responsibility for their actions; ""it was just waiting to happen"". This I strongly disagree with (not least because I work with 16 year old kids and they are completely able to take some level of responsibility for their actions).<p>Sure, at 16 your world view is incomplete and you can make rash decisions (""for the lulz"") that backfire bigger and faster than you imagine. On the other hand there is no doubt they knew the illegality and the ethical issues with undertaking this - even if only vaguely.<p>And if they do not completely understand those issues, do you not think they should be taught them? As responsible adults we should be getting across to them in a sensible fashion that this was not a nice thing to do, and that the impact could have been a lot wider than it was.<p>Because if we don't and next time they do some real damage, well, that was an opportunity lost.<p>FWIW I think he crossed the line by causing damage. If I caught a kid breaking into my house I would probably drag him home to face his parents. But if he started smashing plates I'd be a little more pissed, that is a wanton act and probably needs a more severe punishment.<p>Sure, criminal charges are a silly approach in this case (no need to ruin his life for one silly mistake). Call his parents, explain what has happened and then get him to do some sort of ""community service"". That's an important lesson in consequence.<p>In this modern world 16 year olds are not nicking alcohol from the corner shop any more; they are breaking into websites. And that has potential for much more dramatic and widespread impact. We need to stop saying ""oh, they're only kids"". Instead we should recognise that 16 year old ""hackers"" exist on the internet and think of ways to communicate with them (ideally in a way that gives them an avenue for their curiosity without risking too much damage :)).<p>Bottom line; a 16 year old kid is a far cry from your dog when it comes to the ability to ""understand"" what you have done.<p>Just my 2p :)",1300873794

A wave is an act of nature: this is more along the lines of a jealous kid who knocks down someone else's sandcastle because he can't build his own.</i><p>In terms of moral culpability, sure. But when I put systems on the internet, I basically treat ""intrusion attempts"" as in practice part of the environment, like ""mosquito bites"" are in Texas. Perhaps they're best thought of as kids knocking down sandcastles rather than ocean waves, but their ubiquity makes them feel more like ocean waves, because you can basically assume that there are tons of those kids, and they're going to kick at your sandcastle every day.<p>The fact that there's a whole ecosystem of bots running automated intrusion attempts makes them feel a little bit force-of-nature-ish as well. If you lived in some neighborhood where thousands of roving robots were constantly checking doors to see if they could find an unlocked one, you'd have to treat ""roving robots"" as a quasi force of nature. Well, either that, or come up with a policing method that finds the controller of the robots and shuts them down, but I have relatively low hopes for how much of a dent ""cybercrime"" policing will make in the overall online-intrusion ecosystem.",1300873638

But the PBMR project was cancelled as part of the South African government's cost-cutting measures, the project's rising cost and a belief that the commercial future of the project was bleak. There were also concerns from some quarters about the resistance of the graphite coatings on the spheres to fire. The intended pilot plant was not built.<p>However, I understand that there are other high-temperature reactors like the PBMR in development around the world, so the technology is still being pursued.

Yes, you can describe your most interesting projects as part of your application, but if you read the admission blogs and other MIT materials, it is quite clearly implied that unless you have near-perfect grades and/or near-perfect SAT scores, they won't even look at the project descriptions, essays etc. Also there is no way of knowing why you were accepted or rejected, because the whole proccess is 100% opaque to the outside world.<p>I still think the MIT is awesome and the admission process probably has to look more or less like it looks like because of the volume of applications they have to go through. But the post and some of the comments seem to leave the impression that the MIT addmission comitee will look at every person as a ""unique snowflake"" to find the really outstanding candidates. In reality, the admission process has to be quite mechanical so that they can at all manage it and only after the initial 90% of the applications gets rejected, they can be scrutinize the remaining 10% in more detail. So, if you want to get-in, you have to ""optimize grades and SAT"" and ""speaking French and Chinese, playing piano and painting abstract art"" won't hurt either.",1300872340

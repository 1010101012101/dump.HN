And I had to fork out 1000's of dollars on engine repair (attempts) to even reach the point of deciding it had to be written off. This is with a gas-powered engine, a traditional car. So there is precedent where a car owner can misuse and/or fail to maintain the vehicle properly per the manufacturer's guidelines, and it becomes bricked. This is not a new kind of problem introduced by Tesla.",1330149276

Please do not leave your Tesla with a low charge if you will be away for a long period of time. This should not be a problem for the vast majority of our customers, but some may need to take special precautions, if they will not be driving their car for a long period of time.<p>Day 2:<p>Compare old Tesla to new Tesla. Note how long the new Tesla can last on 50%. Note that all cars have problems (oil, radiators, fan belts); and that it takes time for the new rules to sink in. Note that only a small handful of customers have been bitten, despite it being a completely new system. Note how many people have their engines get cooked, even after 100 years of oil burning cars. Note that electricity is fundamentally simpler, and easier to maintain, and that will only get better with more design work, and as people become accustomed to it.<p>Then wait a while, and find (or make) some good news.

Basically it means that you can pay out-of-pocket for the same coverage your company gave you without a change in price.<p>For my last employer, health coverage ended on the last day of employment.  However if something happens between your quitting and you filling out the form, COBRA still covers you because the law states that as long as you sign up, it's ""retroactive back to the event"", the event being you quitting.  I don't know if this applies for non-citizens.  I would check your employee agreement or handbook for the specific conditions.<p>These details are from my lawyer, however IANAL myself.  For more details on this I would defiantly ask an expert; insurance law is very tricky and my explanation may not be complete.<p>In terms of what '2 weeks notice' actually means, it varies heavily by company.  Some shops walk you out the door immediately or within 24 hours (finance).  Others almost always wait the full 2 weeks to get everything in order.

If Microsoft can sign one contract to sell 100 licenses rather than pay to ship discs and sell them in stores individually, the cost substantially goes down and their profits substantially go up.

Give notice at the beginning of the month, and you might be covered until the end of the month in any case.  Double-check that, though.<p>I think that if you give two weeks' notice, you're doing the company the courtesy of offering to stick around for two weeks to help with the transition.  They might not accept that offer, because they consider you to be a security risk or something, but even if they decline it they're still obliged to pay you for that time, AFAIK; they just won't let you come into the office.<p>While there might be things for which they could terminate you without owing you severance pay, I don't see how giving notice could be one of them.<p>But I'm no expert.  If it matters that much, consult an attorney.",1330146510

3632221,comment,3628942,3631309,3,0,kamaal,,,"Can you suggest a real usable pragmatic option to Perl on a Unix scripting environment?<p>Python and Ruby tried to compete with Perl at the large application level. Interacting with databases and other stuff kind of things.<p>That still doesn't fulfill the requirements Perl was invented for. Larry Wall invented Perl not because he wanted a Python or Ruby, The Python and Ruby of that time were already present in the form of C. Perl was invented because C couldn't do a certain things well. Namely it never natively blended with the Unix philosophy. It couldn't do 'Text' properly. It could not be what awk, sed, grep and other Text processing utilities combined together would be.<p>Besides all that, Perl is a natural evolution to bash, shell, sed, awk, tr, cat and many many other text processing utilities combined together working together in a very large application. That continues to remain Perl's biggest and most distinctive unbeatable advantage so far.<p>Perl is a natural extension to Unix, and it has evolved to now be capable of doing nearly everything. If the name Perl would not have been given to Perl, it would probably Unix programming language. Think of it in that terms.<p>Do you know why despite so much trolling, bashing and criticism Perl receives. It still manages to grow and thrive year after year, decade after decade? Its because Perl is same as C, Lisp, SQL etc. Its a first time done right language.<p>Anything that is likely to replace Perl, will be a bad replacement to Perl. Or at maximum will be or look like Perl(Eg Perl 6).<p>To kill Perl you may have to kill the whole Unix philosophy. Because that is what Perl is. Its a natural extension to Unix.<p>Perl is here to stay for decades to come.<p>Every new generation of programmers will discover Perl and use it just like how every new generation of programmers discover and use C and Lisp. That is what enables stuff like DuckDuckGo to be built in Perl.",1330146421

They are trending towards better targeted somewhat more invasive ads. Virtual currency hasn't really got going yet and as mentioned above people expect them to eventually offer something similar to adsense which would have a high chance of being successful because I think they hold the edge of Google in targeting data.<p>Of course pushing for more profit could turn off users. Google+ though is showing how hard it is right now though to make a significant dent as an opposing social network.<p>As long as Facebook don't do anything stupid I find it hard to see how they will be beaten with a similar model. It is more likely that something else will be built which changes the whole social networking paradigm and makes Facebook less relevant.",1330146236

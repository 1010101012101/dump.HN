In order to do so, however, you need to fill in a hundred-page form with exhaustive details of your personal finances, your medical history, and the contents of your computers&#x27; hard drives; and then you need to play six sets of tennis against a strong player and win at least two; and then you need to play a 7-game chess match against a holder of FIDE&#x27;s International Master title, and win at least two. Oh, and then there&#x27;s a fee of $100k. Once you&#x27;ve done this, your application takes six months to be processed. Every week during this time, you get a callback and are asked intrusive personal questions about your sex life, your religion, and how you have voted in past elections.

If you only want people who have already done this exact job, you are asking people to move laterally, not up.<p>I love a description of common tasks that I would be expected to perform. I like to know how people communicate (multiple in person meetings everyday are a red flag though).<p>Having looked at my github code, or at least at the readme files, is nice. Don&#x27;t ask me if I&#x27;ve ever done angular when I have an angular app on my resume with a working example. btw, I do Angular sure, but I don&#x27;t respond to anything that requires photoshop skills.<p>Jobs that list how their interview process works make me happy.",1435744893

All we have to go on is one vague article.<p>The FISC has its own website which happens to answer your question right on the &quot;About&quot; page[1]:<p><i>The Court sits in Washington D.C., and is composed of eleven federal district court judges who are designated by the Chief Justice of the United States.  Each judge serves for a maximum of seven years and their terms are staggered to ensure continuity on the Court.  By statute, the judges must be drawn from at least seven of the United States judicial circuits, and three of the judges must reside within 20 miles of the District of Columbia.  Judges typically sit for one week at a time, on a rotating basis.</i><p>> ...and that article suggests that (if we accept they rotate duty and meet monthly say) they spend, on average, (8 hours / 133 * 60 minutes) ~3.5 minutes carefully evaluating each application. If not, it&#x27;s ~30 seconds per application.<p>No, the article says 33 per week.  The judges aren&#x27;t meeting together every few months; the sitting judge is replaced by the next every week or so.  Assuming an 8 hour work day and 33 warrants per week, that (8 * 5) / 33 = 1.2 hours per warrant on average.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/about-foreign-intelligence-surveillance-court"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fisc.uscourts.gov/about-foreign-intelligence-surv...</a>",1435744887

Faulty intelligence has led to quite a few wars, and is worse than no intelligence at all, also, what intelligence there is tends to be cherry picked to support foregone conclusions.",1435744809

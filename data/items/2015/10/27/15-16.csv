VERY.  Where I was held on to long-standing processes because &quot;that is the way it has always been done&quot; and those people have usually been there 5, 10, 20 plus years.  Be very careful suggesting that you will put any amount of people out of a job.  Old school companies don&#x27;t often appreciate someone disrupting the way they have been doing things, especially if they have been in business for a long time.

I am proud of what I do and even more proud of the teachers, students and families.<p>1) &quot;Teaching to the Test&quot; is to teachers. They are tested on CLASS (Teacher engagement with the students) ECARDS (Classroom environment) NAECY (Classroom and Teacher Lesson Plans). Federal Reviewers check for Food and general Safety.<p>Children are engage at their point of interest. So if many in the classroom are interested in a subject the teacher will structure the classroom to focus on that subject and make projects etc..<p>2) Parents are very much apart of Head Start. Every one has a Policy Council that parents actually help run and make classroom policies. We also have Family engagement partners that visit the homes as close to monthly as possible to help the families to create successful students. The teachers are required to visit the homes at least 3 times a year.<p>3) I think that is the issue. K-3 does not go through NAEYC or CLASS and usually developmentally inappropriate. There is no family engagement in my experience.<p>CURRENT POLICY of Head Start Agencies - The lowest 10% of CLASS scores are to be de-funded and the contract to be put up for competition.

I.e. fructose that is removed from it&#x27;s natural state and put into concentrated form. This is basically crystaline sugar and high fructose corn syrup.<p>Fructose that appears naturally is not bad for you. The reason is that naturally appearing fructose usually appears with fiber, and it is usually locked in plant cells. The body is perfectly capable of processing this type of sugar. There was a Japanese study where they had people eating large quantities of apples, and their blood tests did not show any of the negative effects associated with large intakes of sugar.<p>The only naturally occurring sugar one should be weary of is honey.<p>Also carbohydrates are not sugar by default. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, but there are other types that are not sugar and should not be confused with it. There are also other sugars (other than fructose) that are perfectly fine. Glucose for example, is not bad for you in any form.<p>There has been a lot of confusing science done by assuming that all carbohydrates are the same.

You may not be completely free, but you aren&#x27;t a slave.<p>You don&#x27;t seem to be fully understanding of what slavery is. There is also a legal category. Slaves have no rights, they could not avail themselves of protections against abuse. Also there is a ownership / fungibility aspect, you can buy slaves on a market. This is what separates serfdom from slavery.<p>The basic idea of slavery is that an entire country, state and nation, participates in psychological and legal domination of subject people. If that&#x27;s not happening, then what you&#x27;re looking at isn&#x27;t slavery. Human trafficking isn&#x27;t slavery, the main difference is that it&#x27;s a group of people that are surreptitiously creating a regime where people can be traded and not an entire country. One may call human trafficking &quot;modern slavery&quot;, and people being trafficked as &quot;slaves&quot;, because it is, after all, an abhorrent practice.<p>But slavery doesn&#x27;t exist in the world any more and to say otherwise demeans the numerous armed conflicts humans have fought all over the world to end real slavery. People are not permitted any more to openly treat humans as cattle and expect the law to respect their &#x27;property&#x27;. Not even North Korea could get away with instituting slavery, though one could speculate on whether slavery would be better for the people in their gulags now.<p>You can look at a particular criteria on a spectrum and draw a line. But we have better words to describe what happens when you remove criteria. There is a rich lexicon of terms we can employ to describe removing freedoms from people. Slavery becomes serfdom when you remove fungibility. When you remove state-participation, it&#x27;s called human trafficking. When all it is is one person forcing another person to keep working, it&#x27;s called forced labor.<p>The modern employment social contract is in no way, shape or form anything like actual slavery, to call it such is to misrepresent both employment and slavery.",1445960834

This is rarely used as it is a PITA to set up/manage, is vendor specific, and duplicates what Windows provides anyway. This is what HP calls their &quot;ProtectTools.&quot;<p>- Windows authentication: Active Directory can be configured to force certain devices (e.g. off-site laptops) to require a smartcard and to validate the smartcard during login. This stops someone attempting to authenticate with AD or login to the laptop without the smartcard. Combined with Bitlocker, it is fairly effective.<p>- VPN authentication: This is extremely common. In order to get onto the corporate network you need a smartcard in addition to credentials. This means you physically need the business&#x27;s hardware to even attempt to break into the VPN (even with stolen credentials).<p>Many businesses that deploy smartcards are doing #2 or #3, with #3 (VPN) being by far the most common.

10458658,comment,10456835,10458379,0,0,planfaster,,,"> The idea that the poor are just too stupid to know how to work is insulting.<p>If you think that is insulting, try getting your ideas attacked through a straw-man argument - that&#x27;s even worse. What most poor people do not understand, however, is that in order for them to live off welfare, somebody else is personally sacrificing their own efforts, labor, life, money that could be saved for their kids, just to pay for some guy who not only has no skills to help society in building wealth, but has a strong enough sense of entitlement to demand that someone help them survive <i>while they get to pick where to live</i>. I want to help all the poor, but being mathematically literate I know this can only work if we put these poor people in a situation where instead of takers, they be producers.<p>> The point of a city isn&#x27;t anything like what is suggested. Its a place where a lot of people gathered to live.<p>You are over-simplifying it to the point of being ahistorical. No, actually cities came about because <i>farmers</i> increasingly wanted to take their chances at being entrepreneurs or employees in an industrial setting. So if you fail at your chance of making it in the city, then you should go back to a farm. Sounds logical to me. That way everyone can keep trying to make it in the city without being a burden on anyone else.<p>> And &#x27;transporting&#x27; folks is what they did to criminals in Britain in the bad old days (usually to Australia).<p>This reads like an emotional sophism to make me feel bad about giving the poor food and shelter that they can actually pay for themselves. Again, think back to our recent past pre Industrial age (1850 and before). Most people were farmers. That&#x27;s the default. Living in the city, where you can&#x27;t produce your own food and have to rely on other people&#x27;s services (which costs money) is not the default. If everyone in the country can never be poorer than owning a small self-sufficient farm where one can live by oneself without needing money, then can you better point at the part of this plan that makes you be against it? I honestly see no problems here, not even an inkling of disrespect towards the poor.",1445960196

What&#x27;s new though is your recommendation to use class names as the exclusive method of binding between CSS and HTML, which in my opinion is not practical and moderately limiting for the aforementioned reasons I listed in a prior reply.<p>Also, it&#x27;s worth mentioning that class naming and achieving consistency and predictability throughout a project is an extra work to do and from my experience it can be very daunting. I already suffer and I can barely cope with the organizational overhead that comes with naming files descriptively and consistently, and how to structure the project tree accordingly, and as you know a poor implementation is no better than having none.<p>So, I don&#x27;t really need to map the original CSS problem to a naming one in HTML to make things worse for me. If it works for you, you should go for it but with the knowledge that there are other people out there who prefer another approach away from these &quot;clerk&quot; duties.<p>As with the other point you raised of the disadvantage of mirroring the HTML structure in your CSS, I&#x27;d like to get your feedback on some examples. Do you really think that having something like «ol > li» or  «select > option» is excessive? Aren&#x27;t these elements highly coupled by nature? You don&#x27;t really expect a «div» or «section» to be a child of an «ol» element, do you?<p>I know that HTML parsers are forgiving by nature but expecting them to break the basic rules of the language is ridiculous.<p>Here&#x27;s another example, I recently wrote a timeline module/widget that has a distinct style for both the  start  and finish points while another one for the other points. So, I opted for a tightly coupled solution for that using pseudo classes like «:first-child», «:last-child», «nth-child(odd):not(:first-child)» ...<p>Do you really think that this is unnecessary and difficult to reason about in the context of that the design is prescribed this way that the first and last elements share a certain style while the others share another one with slight modifications for odd and even elements?<p>Yeah you might it view this style as a bit verbose compared to going class-only but the styling of the module is very rational and predictable to the point that can be extended programmatically to other contexts with the help of mixins or other constructs.<p>In the end, the whole proposal of restricting styling to only class selectors is not enticing or compelling enough for me to make the switch, at least for now.",1445959327

Blaming them is pointless.<p>I agree that the point of cities is inaccurate, but the problem isn&#x27;t that they&#x27;ve been squeezed out, it&#x27;s that they don&#x27;t have homes, but are otherwise still there.  Perhaps I&#x27;m just being pedantic here, but squeezed out implies that they aren&#x27;t there any more, and in the case of city homeless, they generally are.<p>That said, you&#x27;ve completely ignored the point of the post.  Utah has had success in giving away vacant homes to their homeless, with the qualifier that if you&#x27;re getting a free home, you don&#x27;t also necessarily get to pick its location.  Comparing it to penal colonies is a straw man, but regardless, the question is whether or not a homeless person in NYC would accept a free home, perhaps slightly upstate.  If not, why not?  There are currently more vacant homes across America than there are homeless persons, and it&#x27;s not infeasible to suggest that if adverse possession were slightly restructured, we could completely solve the problem of involuntary homelessness within a decade, though of course any such solution will introduce new problems as well.",1445959215

First, these rich people are just fleecing the &quot;system&quot; and governmental powers should be increased to prosecute them.  \nOr, the &quot;progressive&quot; tax system is particularly punitive for high net worth individuals, and they will continue to shell out millions to wealth managers while tax laws are actively hostile to their assets.  (Tax collections have been ~19% throughout U.S. history, even when tax rates were as high as 90%.[0])  On a purely &quot;practical&quot; level, tax codes should be simplified and taxes lowered so that it&#x27;s more economical for those of high net worth to comply with the intent of the law, rather than skirt it.

Athough inclusion of a separate external control group would have been optimal, it would have presented novel challenges of its own, such as: 1) if subjects under- or over-estimated their baseline fructose consumption, then providing them their reported daily fructose content would be problematic; 2) altering each subject&#x27;s diet while trying to maintain the baseline fructose content would require changes in liquid versus solid, which may also result in caloric change, altered absorption, and altered satiety; and 3) our participants were all patients in an obesity program. We did not believe that maintaining fructose at the same level, even within a study, is commensurate with the message that the change in macronutrient composition is important for their health, and in order to use the study as an “educational moment.” Furthermore, others have looked longitudinally at children with obesity over time without any intervention, but still within the confines of a study, and had seen no changes in metabolic outcomes [39]. Rather, each participant served as his or her own control. Our paradigm of dietary sugar and fructose restriction, which included mid-study dietary adjustments to compensate for weight loss, resulted in a 4% decrease in percentage of calories from carbohydrate, a 2% increase in percentage of calories from protein, and a small increase in dietary fiber, which could have reduced macronutrient absorption [18], flux of fructose to the liver, and also increased satiety. Recognizing that consumption data by recall is routinely underestimated [24], we made every effort to maintain our participants&#x27; baseline weight throughout the 10-day study interval, and even increased the caloric allotment partway through the cohort, yet a decline of 0.9 ± 0.2 kg was noted during the 10 days.",1445959078

But the reason I take the statement seriously is that I once tried to genuinely play chess like an asshole, and there was a very intelligent guy who was able to thwart it.<p>I read a book called &quot;how to think ahead in chess&quot; and discovered that I could lock down the game against a computer by playing queens pawn, building what is called a &quot;stonewall&quot; defense, and then slowly maneuvering along lines that I understood.  It was a good way to play against a computer, because it limited the options to the point where I was better able to see one or two moves ahead by reasoning only along a couple of lines, whereas the computer (this was back in the late 80s, I think) still needed to crunch a bunch of unnecessary numbers.<p>The guy who could beat me?  When I played queen&#x27;s pawn, he played king&#x27;s pawn.  Go ahead, take it.  One pawn sacrificed to blow the game wide open, and all of a sudden, creativity, the ability to see lots of positions and opportunities?  Easy.<p>The reason I say <i>I</i> was playing chess like an asshole was actually documented in Martin Amis&#x27;s book &quot;the Information.&quot;  There&#x27;s a scene where one writer decides to essentially crush the other&#x27;s self esteem by beating him at all the games they play (tennis, chess).  He hires a chess instructor, and the chess instructor, teaching him what I think is pretty clearly the queen&#x27;s pawn stonewall, reflects that what he is teaching almost feels more like how to cheat at chess than really play it.<p>It works, unless your opponent is much better at the game and realizes that giving up a pawn and a bit of position early on is a small price to pay to take you out of a game that you know very well and throw the entire board into chaos ;)",1445958643

Your link [1] mentions that this would include pictures and SMS messages, which is probably what they were after.<p>2. Custom firmware from Apple will help to access <i>encrypted</i> parts since it would allow to run the OS under the cracker&#x27;s control, who then only needs to brute force the password and not the UID. According to [1] this is still slowed down to 12.5 attempts per seconds (80 ms) and newer iPhone hardware additionally contains hardware enforced rate or number of guesses limits.<p>Edit: custom firmware would of course also help in case 1 in the sense that it makes it unnecessary to unsolder the flash. But my estimate for the effort needed to do the latter would be around USD 1000 if done exceptionally, perhaps USD 100 if done often enough. I wonder if Apple&#x27;s unlocking service would be any cheaper. So perhaps the reason it&#x27;s not being done is psychological (Apple complying is offloading the question whether it&#x27;s OK), or the law, or worries about the constitution.",1445958633

You will quickly learn which type of product is ok and which type is not.<p>Today I am more attracted to a fruit than a cup cake or an ice cream, and it feels good :)",1445958043

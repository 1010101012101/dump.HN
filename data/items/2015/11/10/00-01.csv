For example a candidate like Rand Paul should get enough support. It is not even necessary that this candidate should win, but once politicians realize that there is vote issue to be exploited they will bite the bait.<p>It is remarkable that the government wants to spy teenagers sharing nudes but cant prosecute Hillary Clinton who seem to have actually put sensitive information at danger.",1447117082

It would not clone HN.  It would just be for a niche group of people, interested in old mechanical watches-- basically their repair.

They usually have terrible accessibility. They don’t interoperate with other applications on the system. They flagrantly violate UI design conventions on every platform. They can’t access most local hardware devices. They have an extremely limited user input device model. Their UI layout tools are limited, inflexible, and incredibly hard to work with.

This was a major historical problem for Western traders in the China market - outside of bullion, and furs, to some extent, they had a real hard time finding products that they could successfully trade.<p>It&#x27;s not as though China was bereft of the capabilities of fielding a large, powerful fleet - the Zheng He expeditions in the Ming dynasty were quite impressive, even if the accounts are somewhat exaggerated, and some of the biggest naval battles in history have been fought on Chinese lakes and rivers.  But historically, the government was always facing serious threats from the interior of Asia, whereas coastal threats were generally little more than pirates.  This has some knock-on effects - less incentive to study astronomy and geometry, when you aren&#x27;t using them to sail ships around the world, different approaches to fortification - the Great Wall was more of a Ming thing, whereas the Qing, as an outsider foreign dynasty, tended towards assimilation of Mongols and other dangerous nomads into the ruling elite and the banners instead.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.csun.edu/~jaa7021/hist531/Goldstone%20-%20Efflorescences%20and%20Economic%20Growth.pdf#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csun.edu/~jaa7021/hist531/Goldstone%20-%20Efflore...</a>",1447115583

Some vendors start writing specific optimisations for emscripten-style JavaScript code.<p>3. This is formalised into a subset of JavaScript called asm.js.<p>4.

Its the same here in Connecticut and I take advantage of it.<p><a href=""http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?A=2705&Q=323792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ct.gov/deep/cwp/view.asp?A=2705&Q=323792</a><p>Connecticut&#x27;s shore belongs to the people--not just in terms of our environmental and cultural heritage, but in a specific legal sense as well.  Under the common law public trust doctrine, a body of law dating back to Roman times, all coastal states as sovereigns hold the submerged lands and waters waterward of the mean high water line in trust for the public.   The general public may freely use these lands and waters, whether they are beach, rocky shore, or open water, for traditional public trust uses such as fishing, shellfishing, boating, sunbathing, or simply walking along the beach.  In Connecticut, a line of state Supreme Court cases dating back to the earliest days of the republic confirm that private ownership ends at mean high water line, and that the state holds title to the lands waterward of mean high water, subject to the private rights of littoral or riparian access.<p>The public trust area comprises submerged lands and waters waterward of the mean high water line in tidal coastal, or navigable waters of the state of Connecticut.  On the ground, the public trust area extends from the water up to a prominent wrack line, debris line, or water mark.  In general, if an area is regularly wet by the tides, you are probably safe to assume that it is in the public trust.  The public trust area is also sometimes referred to as tidelands, and is defined as &quot;public beach&quot; by the Connecticut Coastal Management Act, C.G.S. 22a-93(6).<p>&quot;Public rights include fishing, boating, hunting, bathing, taking shellfish, gathering seaweed, cutting sedge, and of passing and repassing. . .&quot; Orange v. Resnick, 94 Conn. 573 (1920).<p>&quot;It is settled in Connecticut that the public has the right to boat, hunt, and fish on the navigable waters of the state.&quot;  State v. Brennan, 3 Conn. Cir. 413 (1965).  The public has the right to fish and shellfish over submerged private lands, Peck v. Lockwood, 5 Day 22 (1811).<p>The public has the right to pass and repass in navigable rivers, Adams v. Pease 2 Conn. 481 (1818) .<p>The public may gather seaweed between ordinary high water and low water, Chapman v. Kimball 9 Day 38 (1831).<p>In almost every case, private property ends, and public trust property begins, at the mean high water line (often referred to as &quot;high water mark&quot; in court decisions).   Mean high water is the average of high tides over a defined period, and its elevation can be obtained from standard references, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Tidal Flood Profile charts.<p>The public owns up to &quot;high water mark,&quot; Simons v. French, 25 Conn. 346 (1856).<p>Title of riparian proprietor terminates at ordinary high water mark, Mather v. Chapman, 40 Conn. 382 (1873).<p>&quot;High water mark&quot; = &quot;mean high water mark&quot; = &quot;ordinary high water mark.&quot;  Private ownership of submerged lands is possible, only when basins are dredged from upland, or from inland, non-navigable waters.  Michalczo v. Woodmont, 175 Conn. 535 (1978).<p>The adjacent landowner has the exclusive riparian or littoral right of access to navigable water.  This does not mean that the owner can exclude others from the adjacent waters, but that only the owner may get to the water from his or her upland, as by constructing a dock or other structures where appropriate and appropriately authorized.   In terms of access, navigable waters are equivalent to a public road, and a dock serves the same purpose as a private driveway.  A littoral landowner may not exclude the public from lawful uses of the public trust area, just as an upland owner cannot exclude the public from driving or walking on the street in front of his or her house.  Of course, nuisance behavior in the public trust, such as littering, intoxication, etc. would constitute a breach of the peace, just as if done by neighbors on adjacent upland property.",1447113759

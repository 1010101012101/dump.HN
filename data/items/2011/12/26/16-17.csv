Specifically, what timeframe do you define as ""long term"", and why do you privilege that timeframe over other timeframes?<p>And sometimes exploitation is better than exploration.<p>Microsoft is a great example of this. Currently MS dumps billions into Bing, a form of exploration. If the shareholders were given a choice, do you think the would choose this? Most likely not - if they wanted to explore search, they would probably dump billions into GOOG. Microsoft shareholders would probably be better off if MS stopped exploring, exploited current revenue streams, and allowed shareholders to invest in businesses with a brighter future.<p>The working definition should be ""maximizing shareholder's time and risk discounted value"". After all, $100 now is better than $100 over 10 years (maybe, if we are lucky). When a company focuses on creating long term value, they are gambling with shareholder wealth. They should only do this when the odds are good.<p><i>Let's make the law that the managers' options can only be excersized after 10 years.

Hovering the icon over a program in the task bar makes it simple to quickly monitor the operation of a terminal app or what have you whilst reading something in a web browser without having to go through the trouble of rearranging your windows around. Also, the semi transparency while moving windows makes it easy to just click on the title bar and see what's going on in a window underneath. I love the scale effect where you can mouse to a corner and all of your windows show ike on Mac osx. That is a boon for window management when you have a lot going on.

You could actually write this all with something like gevent, however Flask lends itself to extensibility and you could certainly use this as a component of a larger app.<p>The primary functionality goes like this: Essentially I wrote a small script to read off a log file, that runs concurrently as a greenlet via gevent. Anything it reads is pushed to juggernaut which uses socketio to publish that along a channel. The frontend reads off that channel, pushing in realtime.<p>I actually spent more time styling it than I did coding it.

Indeed, one of the more anomalous consequences of petitioners argument is that it accepts federal supremacy over the procedural aspects of determining the times, places, and manner of elections while allowing the States carte blanche with respect to the substantive qualifications for membership in Congress.""</i><p><i>""The Framers decided that the qualifications for service in the Congress of the United States be fixed in the Constitution and be uniform throughout the Nation.	That decision reflects the Framers understanding that Members of Congress are chosen by separate constituencies, but that they become, when elected, servants of the people of the United States.	They are not merely delegates appointed by separate, sovereign States; they occupy offices that are inte- gral and essential components of a single National Government. In the absence of a properly passed constitutional amendment, allowing individual States to craft their own qualifications for Congress would thus erode the structure envisioned by the Framers, a structure that was designed, in the words of the Preamble to our Constitution, to form a more perfect Union.""</i>",1324917143

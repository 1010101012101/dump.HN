940129,comment,940043,940100,0,0,vito,,,"That blew my mind for a bit too. It's not lazy in the sense of postponing evaluation, it just blocks until something reads or writes from the channel. This could go on forever assuming you have something that reads from the channel in an infinite loop (as it looks like it's doing in main(), actually...), but the generators themselves only loop when the channel is interacted with.",1258127817
940128,comment,940043,940043,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I think one of the nicest things about this are its origins in CSP.  By using channel communication for synchronization between threads you eliminate all the hassle of worrying about mutexes and shared memory.<p>And they have a nice choice operator called select which allows the language to read from multiple channels at the same time and make a random choice about competing channels to send to.  See this example:<p><pre><code>  var c, c1, c2 chan int;
  var i1, i2 int;
  select {
  case i1 = <-c1:
    print(""received "", i1, "" from c1\n"");
  case c2 <- i2:
    print(""sent "", i2, "" to c2\n"");
  default:
    print(""no communication\n"");
 }

  for {  // send random sequence of bits to c
    select {
      case c <- 0:  // note: no statement, no fallthrough, no folding of cases
      case c <- 1:
    }
  }
</code></pre>
The style corresponds to the CSP choice operator where the bottom select is doing something like<p><pre><code>  P = ( 0 -> P ) OR ( 1 -> P )
</code></pre>
OR there is the CSP non-deterministic choice operator.  Either branch can go ahead.<p>CSP doesn't make a distinction between sending and receiving on a channel (it doesn't have channels, merely the parallel, or interface parallel, operator to combine processes).  Essentially sending is offering to synchronize on a single value and receiving is accepting to synchronize on any value: run those in parallel you get a communication channel.",1258127810

940119,comment,940043,940043,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"> Goroutines all run in the same thread<p>Rob Pike's presentation says something quite different.  It says that gccgo ""allocates one goroutine per thread"" and that 6g has ""good goroutine support, muxes them onto threads"".<p>The language FAQ says:<p>""Goroutines are part of making concurrency easy to use. The idea, which has been around for a while, is to multiplex independently executing functions—coroutines, really—onto a set of threads. When a coroutine blocks, such as by calling a blocking system call, the run-time automatically moves other coroutines on the same operating system thread to a different, runnable thread so they won't be blocked. The programmer sees none of this, which is the point. The result, which we call goroutines, can be very cheap: unless they spend a lot of time in long-running system calls, they cost little more than the memory for the stack. """,1258127561

My original point is that there are no compelling reasons for me to use a language like Clojure over a language like Ruby. Clojure's biggest selling point, having high-level primitives to parallelize with, is meaningless to me because it is so slow, and it's other selling point, increased productivity, doesn't doesn't mean much to me either because I feel like I can be just as productive in Ruby or Python.

Essentially a packet multiplexer/demultiplexer if I read it all right, that will pack all the requests on the sending side and unpack them at the receiving end to go to their respective handlers.<p>By the way, the 'server pushes resources before the client has asked for it' is what has been making my webcam software functional for the last 15 years or so.<p>I clued in to that in '95 or so using the server-push technology and figured out that since I already knew that the next request would be for another frame of the same cam why not send it right now instead of waiting for the browser to ask for it...",1258127135

So lots of government offices, etc.<p>Given she worked in print and they didn't print her photo on bylines, the average joe didn't know what she looked like. More than once she got a juicy lead on a story just be overhearing people talking about work when they were in queues at the grocery store or bank.<p>Also, I once took a seat on a train in a group of four seats. 3 guys in suits came and took the other seats, and then started having a conversation about financial details of a construction project for Company X. After about 15 minutes I said ""Look, sorry. I can't let you talk about this any more. I work for Company X.""<p>They didn't get the contract.<p>Serves them right. Just because I dress like a tramp doesn't mean that I don't have a job where I know the people who'll get your multi-million dollar contract cancelled for being careless with confidential details.",1258125487

He gave me his real number, but when I SMS'd him, it appeared to his phone via Google voice's SMS system. While it's cute and clever, it's not right. He was a bit confused, because he only gives his Google voice info to certain people. Knowing my background as a geek, he figured that I'd somehow compromised something just to show off, and was none too amused about it.",1258124698

Really folks, it doesn't matter. Now, if you had syntax that will result in a massive decrease in efficiency I'm willing to listen. For example, the ""function"" keyword in Javascript or the lack of implicit typing during assignment in Java are worth talking about, but really at the end of the day they are the least of your problems when considering the limitations of a language.",1258124653

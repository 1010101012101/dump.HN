8470,comment,8145,8459,0,0,JMiao,,,"While the elderly would certainly love an easier computing experience, I think my questions above address the overall mainstream population that have a pretty narrow use case when it comes to internet browsing.<p>Your approach to viral distribution sounds very complicated.  <p>How do you go about placing ads on something that's supposed to ease the computing experience?  On top of that, would you need to login using your account at a specific IP address to gain the ""credit"" for installing the app?  How would the system know who to ""credit?""",1175585144

8467,comment,8403,8434,0,0,staunch,,,"One huge difference with YC is the funding amount. YC essentially pays a low salary for a few months to build a prototype. That narrows the talent pool down to people with very minimal financial requirements (couldn't be more than ~5% of the total Great Hackers in the US).<p>Google could afford to take all the other ~95% of Great Hackers by paying a high salary until the project is either killed or a success. The big problem is that Google doesn't fire people for failing, they just move them around like most big companies do. They suffer from the ""good effort"" syndrome, where people are rewarded for ""trying"" even if when they fail to produce ""something users want"".<p>",1175584715

8462,comment,8407,8407,0,0,mauricecheeks,,,"Very little in life is free. <p>Today's internet clearly proves that.<p>Very few websites cost money, and very few websites are free of ads. These ads are a charge to users in the form of annoyance, inconvenience and spam. They ruin a site's layout and distract from valuable content.  <p>Worst of all these ads are EXTREMELY far from being useful. I'm sure most of you have seen the abysmal figures of facebook's 0.04% click through rate. Even giants like facebook and myspace with their millions (or billions) of monthly page views aren't profitable based on traditional ad based business models.<p>Maybe paid sites are the way to go. <p>I know i'd be fine with the death of banner ads.<p><i></i><i>
I predict the future holds one last method of advertising (pat.pend.) and then hopefully in a few years someone will be able to introduce a form of micro-payments that will actually catch on.",1175584302

Install Granmos for your parents, your grandparents, the local senior center, and nursing homes. Then, you get a percentage of advertising revenue from all the new users of Granmos that you're helping.",1175583995

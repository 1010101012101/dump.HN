Interestingly, this (and other control systems) are all linked to serotonin: depression moves the reference value down, making you eat more to feel full; anti-depressants move it up, causing a symptom of ""lack of appetite.""<p>The true diet pill would just be a <i>very</i> selective SSRI, to move your hunger referent to the correct position without affecting your other controls. People don't the idea that they should be taking pills to solve their weight-gain because they have a ""brain imbalance"", though, so they will just keep trying, and failing, to use conscious willpower to overcome their controls, no matter what gets invented in the meantime.",1250377154

765345,comment,764760,764760,0,0,jhancock,,,"I've recently been through testing out 4 different noSQL stores for my new app:  Tokyo, Redis, CouchDB, and MongoDB.<p>For my needs, here's how I ended up with Mongo.<p>Tokyo - I really wanted this to be the answer as its more mature and fairly feature packed.  What killed it was needing to run a different Tyrant for each table/collection.  Maybe we'll see a multi-table-tyrant some day.<p>Redis - Limited by RAM; not full featured.  Redis is probably a very good choice if looking for a better memcached.  I would need two systems, my RDB and Redis.  I want a one-size fits all for my new app.  One killer feature of redis is ""db-side"" editing of collections and sets.  Turns out mongo does some of this as well.<p>CouchDB - I've read mixed results on performance and scalability.  The dev model is a bit awkward for me.  There are simplifications on that, but I'm not interested in using some ActiveRecord look-alike as I want the unique features of the DB to be more transparent.    Time may fix these issues.<p>MongoDB - more full featured than the above, sort of a healthy blend of each.  I can use mongo as both a cache and a full-on DB, although I do not expect the cache to perform as redis would, I just expect it to be ""good enough"".  The dev model is simple, the monogo-ruby-driver is a good mid-level API.<p>I'm still in the dev process for the new app.  Hopefully, I won't run into a serious hitch with Mongo...time will tell.  So far, I'm very pleased.",1250377146

So if copyright infringement is that important to you, then just register your blog posts. The registration requirement is not there to help big corporations but to create proof that you had control of a the thing that is allegedly copyrighted at a certain date.<p>The US legislature decided that in order to fairly charge statutory damages, it should at least have some evidentiary certainty to when something was copyrighted. So the registration requirement was created to provide some certainty.<p>The fee seems proportional to the costs of running the whole registration scheme by the library of congress. So it is not there to punish you for being poor.<p>If you really care about your blogs being registered I can suggest a couple of tricks:<p>- register a bunch of blog entries together. For example you can register a whole year of blogging as a single work.<p>- You can not register all your blog posts, but if you see someone stealing something from you, register the thing they stole. They will probably continue the copyright violation after your registration.<p>(PS while I am a lawyer, none of the above is legal advice and no client attorney relationship is created.)",1250377123

Writing is hard work, and without the threat of perishing, researchers outside academia generally do less publishing than their colleagues at universities.  I wrote an initial draft, which displeased Shostak so much that he completely rewrote it to produce the final version.""<p>This is one of two great fundamental results in consensus protocols; the other being the later FLP result which shows the impossibility of consensus with failures in an asynchronous network.  Byzantine fault tolerance was a hot topic in systems for the last roughly ten years thanks to Turing Award winner Barbara Liskov's work with Miguel Castro on Practical BFT that sparked a bit of a resurgence; the two most notable other papers IMHO in the field since that are 'Separating Agreement From Execution' paper from UT Austin and the SOSP '07 paper on Zyzzyva.

You would not want to admit that years of suffering to get onto some type of diet were in vain.<p>My personal ethos is the caveman diet. Which means just try to eat what a caveman would have eaten. If one looks at the evolutionary development of man, most of it was spent as a hunter and gatherer. So you can be sure that our digestive system has more or less evolved for the hunter gatherer lifestyle and/or primitive farmer lifestyle. The time humans started modern farming has been far too little to cause any changes.<p>So my theory is to try to eat what a hunter gatherer would have eaten. I guess that means a lot of vegetables and fruits, starch is ok, whole grain bread, and some meat but not a lot in comparison with everything else, and of course little/no fat.<p>Of course there are people that treat nutrition like a science, and you can see a lot of scientific articles, but it is very uncertain because it is very difficult to run experiments on humans.",1250375714

If you actually consider human populations, you will quickly discover that all these Malthuisms fall apart pretty quickly. Which makes sense considering humans are complicated beings and not simple autonomons like mice that will breed at any opportunity.<p>According to Malthus, the richer a population is the more it will grow and it will get poorer, so please do not bother helping poor countries, or poor people. Instead let them be poor so they automatically limit their populations. Oh and also we cannot achieve a great society where there is no poverty, because when there is no poverty people will just starts breeding like rabbits until everyone is poor again.<p>But of course in real life everything is backwards. The poorer a country is the more its population grows. In a country with income disparity the poor income groups grow much faster than the rich, and sometimes the rich ones do not grow at all.<p>This planet suffers from population overload but most of it is caused from poor populations (poor countries, or poor groups of rich countries).<p>If a poor country becomes richer relatively quickly it does not suffer a population explosion.

9640736,comment,9638305,9640445,0,0,nogridbag,,,"Is your main complaint over theming ExtJS? We&#x27;re also building enterprisey software that&#x27;s for the most part not consumer facing. Our clients are much more concerned about functionality. So while we have several custom themes for our products, we haven&#x27;t drastically altered the base themes.<p>Regarding boilerplate, I&#x27;ll give you a simple example. In ExtJS 4, it&#x27;s one line of code to wire up an event handler in your controller to a view component like a &quot;Save&quot; button. Then in your onSaveButtonClicked event handler in your controller, you typically you write something like:<p><pre><code>    myView.setLoading(true) // to mask the view
    myModel.save() // to execute an Ajax req,
        on success,
           myView.setLoading(false)
</code></pre>
In React+Flux, clicking the Save button calls an action creator. The action creator first fires an event &quot;loading: true&quot; before it does anything. A store which is bound to that load action then calls a method which dispatches another event. The view which is listening on the store is notified that &quot;something changed&quot; and redraws itself (to show the loading mask/spinner). All this and we haven&#x27;t even begun loading any data yet. Repeat all steps once the data is loaded or if an error occurs.<p>I&#x27;m not against React at all - just for our purposes ExtJS seems like a better fit. To be fair, I did spent some time building a custom URL router which really simplifies everything. All of our controllers are consistent with start() and stop() methods, they can define data dependencies (i.e. this data needs to be loaded before start is called), etc.",1433181447
9640735,comment,9639624,9640573,0,0,slapshot,,,"Well hang on a second.  You show a graph and claim that &quot;the actual development is pretty close to a scenario predicting a collapse mid century&quot;.  But the model to date (1900-2000) shows steadily increasing population, food production, pollution, etc.  Unsurprisingly, the 25 years of reality on the graph (1975-2000) following the date of the model shows steadily increasing population, food production, etc.<p>The model then predicts a sudden shift in 2025 without any inherent explanation.  There&#x27;s a vaguely-defined downward-sloping &quot;resources&quot; line on the graph that seems to drive the sudden shift, but there&#x27;s no actual data given for the 1975-2000 period to know if actual &quot;resources&quot; are tracking the model.  I&#x27;d guess not --- as much as the Bakken shale oil formation may have some serious environmental impacts, it (and many other discoveries) have dramatically increased energy resources.  Food production doesn&#x27;t show any signs of immediate collapse.  Renewable energy is still expensive, but it&#x27;s getting better faster than many expected.  Etc.<p>So, 25 years of steadily increasing population does not validate this model in any meaningful way.  The model depends on a sudden shift in ~2025 that no empirical evidence supports.  It might still happen -- I can&#x27;t rule it out -- but the data given hardly confirms this model.",1433181436

9640732,comment,9639627,9640570,0,0,oinksoft,,,"You think those are the only confounding factors? What about tolerances so that no balls will be damaged in transit? Or is there an acceptable loss rate? How are the balls to be loaded into the trailer? Surely this is not a special ping-pong ball delivery trailer with a feeder and drainage pipe, so how will they be boxed? Do human factors affect the box size, and as a result, the number of balls that can fit? Will the trailers be stacked, and does this alter their capacity? If we don&#x27;t have to box the balls, and they are stored tightly, could they settle in such a way as to become jammed, risking loss during unloading (tension is relieved, and they burst out the trailer)? Ping-pong balls are spherical, and the geometry of their fit is not as simple as that of rectangular objects, too. Are you expecting the candidate to solve a non-trivial geometry problem in a high-pressure situation? Why? Will the balls be transported between substantially different air pressures or temperatures? Is this important for ping-pong balls?<p>See how this could coax a poor performance out of an inquisitive, somewhat introverted candidate, rendering a false negative?<p>Beyond that, there&#x27;s the more important adversarial tone: As an employee, will the smallest misstep result in termination? What if I have a problem that cannot be easily solved with a search engine? Is this a cooperative environment where I will feel somewhat secure as an employee, or is my status fragile?

Not Silicon Valley. Not even really tech. But cool :)<p>GDC (<a href=""http://www.gothamdreamcars.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gothamdreamcars.com</a>) is an ultra-exotic car rental company.  I started it about 11 years ago and have built it organically to a multi-city company renting out some of the coolest cars on earth.<p>A few years ago I dove headfirst into the tech side of things, taught myself to code, brushed off the &#x27;ol design skills, and built our entire tech stack myself - and it now runs the whole company. But I&#x27;m focused on other things these days and don&#x27;t have the time to maintain / continue to develop the site, so it&#x27;s time to bring someone on board to handle it.<p>It&#x27;s not the most world-changing stuff -- essentially a CRUD app with a consumer-facing frontend and admin-facing backend for managing the fleet, booking reservations, doing light CRM, billing, logistics, etc. But it&#x27;s incredibly satisfying to work on -- every feature directly helps the employees in the office work more efficiently, helps the cars get booked more often, and helps our customers stay happy. It&#x27;s step-by-step replacing manual processes and has a huge impact on the company, employees and customers.<p>If you&#x27;re looking for some satisfying part-time, remote Rails + Frontend work and are interested in directly improving an interesting business that deals with Ferraris and Lamborghinis, this might be ideal for you. There&#x27;s zero overhead here -- if you have an idea for a feature, you can go ahead code it up and push it live that day.<p>You don&#x27;t have to be a senior Rails or JavaScript expert - you just have to be better than I am ;) (I&#x27;m a solid intermediate.)  But please do have experience with Rails - I&#x27;d prefer to work with someone who can hit the ground running.<p>There&#x27;s a long list of fun features on my to-do list, so the first few weeks/months would be more involved as you bang out updates and get things caught up, then it would transition to maintenance, new features, new ideas, etc. over time.  I expect needing ~30 hrs/week for the first few months and then scaling down to 10-20 hrs/week.<p>Note I&#x27;m pretty serious about &quot;full stack&quot; here -- I&#x27;ve been a one-man band the past few years and you&#x27;re effectively going to replace me in day-to-day stuff, so while you don&#x27;t need to be a pro graphic designer too, you should have some basic design skills since it&#x27;s all you.  I&#x27;ll still be here and can certainly help in this area, but I&#x27;m going to lean on you for a majority of the heavy lifting.<p>A bit about our stack and some of the tasks at hand:<p>* Rails (currently on 3.2, moving to 4.x)
* MongoDB (but that&#x27;s gotta go, so we&#x27;re moving to Postgres)
* Stylus for CSS (not wedded to it - open to SASS/LESS if it makes sense)
* Haml / Slim for HTML templates
* JavaScript (currently mess of jQuery - TBD which framework we&#x27;ll move to)
* Git-based workflow<p>If this sounds interesting/fun and you like the idea of taking ownership over a live web app from top to bottom, take a look at the site, shoot me an email (contact info in HN profile) and we&#x27;ll discuss.",1433180739

9640640,comment,9638925,9640025,0,0,joshstrange,,,"Herein lies the problem, who defines &quot;civility&quot;? My idea of civility and yours may be quite different and my actions may keep within my bounds but exceed yours.<p>For example the &quot;Donglegate&quot; incident I, to this day, don&#x27;t feel like they said anything directly sexist or with sexist intent. They were making, admittedly lame/off-color, private jokes and were overheard. If I had heard these 2 guys I would have just ignored it if not finding &quot;I&#x27;d fork his repo&quot; a little funny (Really, we are going to crucify someone for making a slightly-dirty joke when we use sex to sell everything from bail bonds to web servers??? Where is the Godaddy outrage? Yes I know it exists but no one is losing their job over that AFAICT) and understanding the actual meaning of that statement. At this point I still see no fireable offence. What she did next, tweeting an image and getting them kicked out, was stupid on her part. She was in a dev relations position and by getting devs kicked out of a dev conference for joking amongst themselves she might as well have signed her pink slip. The developer should not have been fired from his job IMHO and I&#x27;m glad he has since found work.<p>This whole thing terrifies me, to know that a single off-color joke, drunken mistake, or similar in my off-duty time could cost me my job. I&#x27;ll agree to that when I start getting paid 24/7...<p>I also think that what this fan did was not comparable to the PyCon incident as he went out of his way to make these comments (drunk or not) to the reporter while the PyCon dev&#x27;s were talking privately and were overheard. That said we are setting a dangerous precedent here. Don&#x27;t get me wrong &quot;FHRITP&quot; is terrible but the alternative is that we all start self-censoring everything we say for fear of it being misinterpreted or taken out of context. It&#x27;s all well and good when we all agree on what&#x27;s right/wrong but not too long ago supporting gay marriage and/or being gay could have the same argument made to fire someone &quot;We are a company built on values and we cannot employ people who support something like gay marriage or the gay lifestyle&quot;. Today we might laugh at that or ready our pitchforks if it actually happened but 10-20 years ago? It could be viewed just as bad (if not worse) than FHRITP.<p>I&#x27;m terribly conflicted on the whole Brendan Eich situation. On one hand how can you lead a company (containing homosexuals) that promotes openness while having donated to stop those homosexuals from marrying? At the same time it wasn&#x27;t like he directed Mozilla money to it (<i>COUGH</i> Chick-fil-a), it was his personal money. The issue I took was that he obviously hadn&#x27;t changed his mind or he would have simply blogged about how he held those views at that time but had since revised his way of thinking and no longer stood by the decision to donate/support that cause. I was one of the many that called for him to be sacked and I felt sure it was the right thing to do and by and large still do, leadership is different than just any employee. If the president of my company comes out anti-gay then I&#x27;m probably going to start looking for a new job, if an employee does I don&#x27;t assume the entire company feels that way and I&#x27;m going to ignore them and get on with my life. Now if they bring it up all the time, make it focal point of discussions, or actively campaign in the office for their views then I might take issue. So what I&#x27;m saying is I still think I was right because leadership is different than just any employee. But then it becomes &quot;where do you draw the line?&quot; is it just the CEO? Is it all senior management? There isn&#x27;t a good line. Also the line of &quot;representing the company&quot; continues to blur further and further or I&#x27;d just say &quot;If you are in a position that you obviously represent a company then you need to watch what you say and what personal views you display&quot;. For examples does a dev at a conference represent their company? I think it in part comes down to &quot;did your company send/pay for you?&quot; but at the same time these developers did not go into PR so why should we expect them to behave as such?<p>It&#x27;s a very complicated topic and like I said, I&#x27;m very divided on it and truly I&#x27;m not sure what to think, I&#x27;ve asked way more questions than I&#x27;ve answered and at the end of the day I feel like making the &quot;pornography argument&quot;: &quot;I can&#x27;t describe it but I know it when I see it&quot; which I 100% understand is a cop out on top of it being a HUGELY biased to the person who &quot;know&#x27;s it when they see it&quot;.",1433180630

This month, there will not be a post from Matasano Security.  Effective today, there will no longer be a Matasano Security.  Instead, we&#x27;re officially rebranding as NCC Group.<p>In late 2012, Matasano was acquired by NCC Group joining iSEC Partners and later Intrepidus Group.  Since that time, we&#x27;ve been working together, cross staffing projects and benefiting from each other’s expertise.  It&#x27;s been a slow, steady process of increasing cohesion.  We&#x27;ve reached the point where we need to assume a single identity, that of NCC Group.<p>Being a part of this process as it unfolds reminds me a bit of watching the Voltron cartoon series as a child in the &#x27;80s.  The show featured pilots each commanding their own robot lions.  Robot lions are fierce, powerful beings.  But when they came together they&#x27;d form Voltron - a giant humanoid robot with the lions compromising each of it&#x27;s parts.  I like to think this is what&#x27;s happening at NCC Group.  What were previously separate companies each well accomplished in computer security are becoming a single even more formidable entity. &quot;Form arms and body! And, I&#x27;ll form the head!&quot;<p>So, what does this have to do with hiring?<p>Growing a larger company requires a larger number of individuals.  We still need candidates with the same skills as always; programming, reverse engineering, protocol analysis, web application building/breaking, adversarial thinking.  We need people who understand technology and can identify flaws in how it&#x27;s implemented.  We need those who can look at a security weakness, and accurately gauge it&#x27;s relative risk to the organization.  And we need folks who can communicate that risk to multiple audiences, in varying levels of detail.<p>There&#x27;s no better time than now to join us.  Our integration effort has opened up opportunity within the company to focus on areas of specialization, advance skills, and take on ever more complex projects and challenges.  If you&#x27;ve always wanted to be part of something new, but found yourself averse to the risk of early stage start ups, joining us now might be a way to do both.  We&#x27;re stable but we&#x27;re evolving and changing, and our employees will shape what we become.<p>If you want to learn more about us check out our:

I think this restriction can be lifted.<p>Sound travels 2.8m in 1/120th of a second, a frame rate that is available in smartphone cameras today. Therefore, if you have a surface that can be analyzed for sound which is at least 2.8m long in the direction the sound is travelling, you have a snapshot through time of the effect the sound waves have on that surface for the whole ~8ms of the frame&#x27;s duration (if you ignore the problem of progressive scanning).<p>Does this sound reasonable? Maybe you&#x27;d need more than 2.8m.

Flexport is a platform for global trade. We make it easier for the next generation of brands to get their products to market.
Paul Graham says, &quot;Flexport is one of those rare startups that will not merely satisfy its market, but grow it. There will be more international trade because of Flexport, and international trade is a very big thing for there to be more of.&quot;
We&#x27;ve raised $6.9M seed from great investors including Google Ventures, Bloomberg BETA, First Round Capital and others. And we&#x27;ve reached product-market fit with over $1M in monthly revenue. We&#x27;re now looking to build out our engineering team here in San Francisco.
Senior Front-End Engineer
Flexport is looking for talented front-end engineers to join our team here in San Francisco. This is a high impact and high ownership opportunity for self-starters interested in solving real-world problems and streamlining the inefficient industry of global trade.
You’ll report to our CTO, Amos Elliston, who previously co-founded Geni, where he helped build and spin out Yammer.
What You’ll Do
* Create tools that make it easier for companies of all sizes to participate in global trade
* Help build intuitive, highly efficient and performant interfaces to automate the repetitive parts of logistics
What You’ll Need
* Awesome coding skills and Computer Science fundamentals
* Next-level analytical problem solving talent
* Experience in a fast-paced work environment. You ship quality code quickly.
* A product-first approach to building software. You care about the real world functionality of your programming.
* Experience with one or more modern javascript frameworks.
Our Stack
In the frontend, we use React for the views, organize the data flow with Flux architecture, and test our application with Jest. We use a hybrid version of Bootstrap styles mixed with hand-built Sass components as our CSS library and are moving away from Bootstrap as we continue building our apps. We follow OOCSS methodology and use Hologram for documentation.
On the backend, we&#x27;re a Rails shop riding on AWS and Postgres RDS. Using Rspec we believe in just enough testing to provide full coverage without introducing a lot of change friction. Our architecture is light-weight and modular in nature adhering to the fat models, skinny controllers ideology.
Our Process
Flexport engineering is a close-knit team where everyone reviews each other’s Github pull requests. We are expected to learn from our peers and help others learn. Code is released almost everyday or whenever business requires. Our continuous releases are integrated with Travis and Github.
Benefits
* Competitive salary
* Full Medical, Dental, and Vision Package
* Considerable equity in a company growing at breakneck speeds
Come talk to us about the chance to forever change the face of global trade in a professional atmosphere that encourages individuality and responsibility.

The idea is that as part of the build process, you load all of a program&#x27;s code and initial data into memory, then dump the heap. Then at startup, you just have to map the heap back into memory, and possibly fix up pointers if you can&#x27;t load everything at the same address as before.

This is sufficient for the use case of reseeding a PRNG, though not for your signal handler/file descriptor use case.<p>The problem with the algorithm (which I&#x27;m discussing on another subthread) is that the increment of the shared counter needs to be atomic, and the integers need to be 64 bits to avoid wraparound, and I&#x27;m not sure that all architectures support atomic 64 bit increments.<p>Edit: I just realized that check_fork() would spuriously return true in the first process after the second process calls it, which isn&#x27;t so nice.

Backtesting is useful, but it is so bloody hard to accurately incorporate liquidity that I place little value on simulated results when it comes to short duration trades. You really have to jump in and test live, which represents the largest barrier to entry: established shops have the infrastructure & capital to try new ideas. When I was trading, we tested half a dozen new ideas every month in addition to &quot;production trades&quot;.<p>High frequency, IMO, should really be used to identify hardware intensive strategies co-located at the exchanges and utilizing telecommunications strategies not readily available to the market. For example, FPGA and dedicated microwave towers.<p>Lime is excellent, btw, but you really need some volume to justify them.

Ext was great when we started because it gave us all these great out-of-the-box components to just mix and match and shove things together and get things out the door.<p>But relatively quickly (i.e. as soon as we wanted to make something look like it <i>wasn&#x27;t</i> Ext, and you can always easily tell an Ext app) we ran into Ext&#x27;s inflexibility. A huge percentage of our code now is finagling Ext over an entire file of code to do what would be a line and some css in any other framework.<p>I have had the exact opposite experience with &quot;boilerplate&quot;, as I see Ext needing much more of it than React.<p>As a caveat; we are building extremely complex enterprise-level software, but even for the basic stuff if you want to do what Ext wants you to do you are golden.

Of all the things you want to be stable and reliable over time, your basic OS and platform software has to be at the top of the list.<p>While dumping any responsibility to support software older than the latest release has obvious appeal for developers, evergreen software has mostly proven to be mediocre-to-disastrous from the user&#x27;s point of view so far. For business users, it&#x27;s also painful from an internal support point of view, for much the same reasons. And as you mentioned, for an OS or other platform software, anyone developing other software that runs on top of it also faces problems.<p>About the only thing this kind of constantly updating deployment model has been good for is getting security and stability patches out faster. This is beneficial, but that benefit is tempered by the &quot;just ship junk and patch it later&quot; philosophy that has become widespread at the same time. Many of those patches simply shouldn&#x27;t ever have been necessary in the first place, but new releases are now routinely of such poor quality that many people just don&#x27;t bother, and advice to wait until SP1 or the equivalent is common.<p>If I were Microsoft, I think I&#x27;d want my new flagship OS to be the stable, reliable, trustworthy antidote to Apple&#x27;s broken-within-a-week operating systems[1], not something with the same reputation for constantly tweaking things as Chrome/Firefox, on-line SaaS apps, and the like.<p>[1] For legal reasons, I would like to point out that not all Apple operating systems break within a week.

I&#x27;ve been saying that frameworks like Angular, Ember etc. do their dirty-checking in the MODEL, whereas React, Mithril and others do their dirty-checking in the VIEW.<p>The former sometimes get some misses when the underlying data changes but the bound views stay the same. And how often does that really happen? On the other hand, &quot;two-way data binding&quot; is extra sugar that is, indeed, slow. Even Angular 2 got away from that.<p>So what is the point of using React or Mithril? Well, there are two. One is if you enjoy having idempotent rendering functions rendering EVERYTHING OFFSCREEN ON EVERY FRAME for making 1-1 correspondence between &quot;state&quot; and &quot;view&quot; explicit. The other is that Facebook actually uses it in their own products, and open-sources React Native, so you can technically build native apps (if you&#x27;re willing to put up with their embedded JS environment instead of the browser&#x27;s).

9640328,comment,9636861,9639615,0,0,geofft,,,"I don&#x27;t think that algorithm works, but I&#x27;m probably misunderstanding:<p><pre><code>    char *shared, *private;

    bool check_fork() {
        return ++*shared != ++*private;
    }

    shared = mmap(MAP_SHARED...);

</code></pre>
The only way it could work is if you were guaranteed to also call check_fork synchronously in the parent. But if you had that degree of control over forks, then you just know when your forks are and you don&#x27;t need these tricks.<p>The use case here is in an external library (e.g., OpenSSL) where it might be called post-fork by a semi-naive user of the library, or where the library might explicitly want to be usable post-fork (e.g., Apache prefork serving) and need to adjust some state. If you expect the caller to reliably inform the library of forks, then you don&#x27;t need any trickery.<p>Another use case that I&#x27;m interested in is signal handlers, which could be delivered immediately post-fork. If your handler does something like write to a file descriptor (which is very common), those file descriptors mean something different in the parent and the child, so if the post-fork code in the child was in the middle of switching out file descriptors before exec, you might accidentally write to the wrong thing. So you want to be sure that you&#x27;re still in the same process before writing to a particular file descriptor. UNIX doesn&#x27;t offer a way to reset signal handlers on fork, unfortunately.",1433178795

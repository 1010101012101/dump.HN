As described, it has the worst aspects of both systems; all the coordination problems of direct democracy, because anyone that feels inclined to vote on any particular issue has the right to do so, and most of the problems with representative democracy because a huge proportion of people will feel inclined to delegate [most of] their voting to well-funded and persuasive people or groups that may or may not be sincere about what they actually represent.<p>If those casting the delegated votes get secret ballots too, you can throw in a new problem: undetectable and potentially indefinite subterfuge...",1415235469
8565240,comment,8564622,8564622,0,0,joshschreuder,,,"I think the problem is with the Australian case (I am Australian FWIW) is that typically these consumer laws apply to physical goods, and it works quite well in that domain.<p>If your fridge breaks in a short amount of time, say 6 months after you bought it, you are entitled to receive a refund or replacement, as long as you can prove your purchase (this doesn&#x27;t necessarily require a receipt). There is an acceptable amount of time that a product should last that is covered.<p>This is much harder to assess with non-physical items, because they may be released broken, later broken by the devs, or in perfectly working condition, and depending on the situation it is essentially impossible for the vendor to assess whether it&#x27;s the fault of the dev, the customer&#x27;s hardware, or the customer just wants their money back because they finished the title.<p>FWIW I love the Australian consumer laws, I think they are extremely beneficial to the general public and they put the onus on companies to produce and stock well-produced goods and services.

Actually, I remember there was such thing as a Constitution where some guys wrote that people have the rights and government should be restricted in curtailing these rights, and they seemed to think that people&#x27;s rights are preferable and government restrictions can be made only in specific limited areas. But what do they know? They&#x27;re long dead anyway.<p>But let me ask you this: if for you it&#x27;s the same, what problem you have with Jim Crow? After all, Jim Crow laws were approved by many courts and were considered very constitutional for a long time. So for you there was no problem with them? I know why I&#x27;d have problem with that - because they remove people&#x27;s rights, and for only reason that they are of a &quot;wrong&quot; race. For me it&#x27;s bad.

8565232,story,,,1,0,DSBOX,"Ask HN: Network of Successful Individuals",,"Hello fellow HN members, Summary: I have seemed to grasp hold of a viable startup, it has very minuscule traction & growth as of right now, after putting up the beta version I obtained 30 paying users without a dime spent on marketing. I built a subscription based model for the “pre-startup,” Anyways, I am positive the startup can grow & scale quickly but with some resources. The dilemma: I do not have any real mentors or access to successful individuals yet, & I feel like waiting for an incubator/accelerator is a waste of precious time. What do you recommend I do? Digressing, I believe the benefit of joining a reputable incubator such as YC or Techstars is actually not the money at all, it’s the mentorship & network of 24/7 grinders. I believe successful companies have access to high quality mentors, & can grow quickly with the advice provided. (Extra) I built the pre-startup by myself & do not have any friends that are interested or have any connections in building a startup. I also just graduated a university & have attempted to gain contacts but there was an absence of entrepreneurship. Before you answer please don’t tell me the following because, I have attempted these tasks & I concurred that they are a waste of time. -“Meetup Groups,Non-Ivy universities without a REAL entrepreneurial background, Co-Founders lab, SCORE… Etc… Thanks, Your fellow HN member.",1415235177

If you have a job, it costs more to dispute a ticket than to pay it.</i><p>Yes, it is, and that situation is a real problem for some people, such as someone whose car registration has been cloned, resulting in a whole series of tickets about something like the London Congestion Charge even though they live in the north and haven&#x27;t been as far south as London in years.<p>That is why I am personally in favour of courts defaulting to awarding realistic compensation to successful defendants in all prosecutions, combined with the abolition of automated fixed penalty notices generated by any sort of machine.<p>Basically, if something is serious enough to merit a criminal prosecution, I think the authorities should show up with real evidence and if necessary real police officers as witnesses, make a proper case in court, and suck it up if they bring too many cases that fail and it costs them a lot in compensation. I think there is considerable merit in the argument that anything where you don&#x27;t feel such a comprehensive response is justified and instead resort to some sort of automated penalty regime and mass punishments shouldn&#x27;t be dealt with through criminal proceedings at all. (Edit: The flip side of this is that if a police officer pulls you over and in court you really are then found guilty of, say, driving at dangerous speeds, don&#x27;t expect to get away with 3 points on your licence and a token fine.

I&#x27;m pretty successful, but I have often felt that I don&#x27;t fit in and I&#x27;ve had to learn to deal with that.<p>I feel isolated and lonely when there is a group that has a common narrative and set of assumptions that I don&#x27;t fit.  These come out in general statements, assumptions, and/or jokes. Then I have to decide whether to hide my own preferences (lying by omission), get into an argument, or change my preferences.  All three options are exhausting and take energy away from actually doing work.<p>Examples:<p>* Generalizations about &quot;real haxx0rs&quot;:  &quot;programmers have side projects&quot;, &quot;programmers use [operating system of choice]&quot;, &quot;programmers heavily customize their editor&quot;, &quot;programmers can&#x27;t get a girlfriend/are introverted/socially maladapted&quot;, &quot;programmers don&#x27;t care about their clothes&quot;, &quot;programmers don&#x27;t wear a tie&quot;, etc.<p>* Disproportionately caring about one set of users/customers which resembles the team. Example: spending a lot of time talking about/fixing the experience of male users when the vast majority of users are female (and the product is not mature yet); making fun of users and their silly ways when the majority of users are female and/or non-technical and/or young and/or old and/or not from cosmopolitan areas, etc.<p>* Having to have a conversational style that&#x27;s significantly more aggressive than what is natural for me in order not to get left out of conversations.  I have to be comfortable cutting people off in meetings and jumping on the ends of sentences.  I&#x27;ve learned to do it but it&#x27;s pretty exhausting, and takes energy away from actually doing work.  Also, having to jump verbal cues gives me a feeling of insecurity about people not caring what I have to say unless I shove it down their throat, even when that is obviously not the case (because my input is well-received).<p>As a manager/CEO, here are a few things you can do to help:<p>* Allow hires to be vetoed on the basis of not having an inclusive worldview, regardless of their professional ability.  You can ask &quot;tell me of a time when&quot; type questions to suss that out.  Eg, &quot;tell me of a time when you had to convey a complicated technical point across to a non-technical customer (or team)&quot;, and watch for denigrating statements.  I&#x27;ve given product manager candidates hypothetical products to design for a <i>very</i> particular audience, and anyone who made excessive fun of the intended audience was a no hire.<p>* Enforce civil conversational standards around the workplace, ie no off-color jokes, talking down to customers, empty generalizations, etc.  I don&#x27;t mean sending around HR videos on what not to say, I mean simple statements like &quot;That&#x27;s not funny, and offensive&quot; (said flatly), &quot;This customer pays us $X&quot; or &quot;That&#x27;s not how we&#x27;re going to improve our conversion rate&quot;, etc.<p>* Encourage open and written discussion of issues, eg via bugs, written code buddies/reviews, etc.  Have anyone be able to veto a commit (with good reason), or reopen a bug.  Having the bulk of these discussions in writing can help shy/non-confrontational people have their say.  Having a focus on getting things done, and getting them done right, vs how exactly they get done can also help people feel more at ease.<p>* Pay close attention in group discussions to see if anyone is chronically unable to finish their thought without being shut down or talked over by someone else.  If their thoughts have merit, be their advocate and calmly say something like &quot;I&#x27;d like to hear X finish their thought&quot;.  Say it as often as necessary.  Then encourage other people to say it for you, when necessary.<p>Aside from all of this, as an early startup employee I&#x27;ve been mistaken for the admin, and as a consultant I&#x27;ve been in situations where people assumed at first sight that I was dumb, not technical at all, had not programmed for long, and more generally was less competent than others.  If these prejudices survived one conversation they were generally a sign that the company was pretty fucked up and that much more was wrong with it.",1415234520

Not all press releases spin their statements as badly as the worst examples, but all of them should be compared to independent sources for a second opinion.<p>The most sure and certain finding of any preliminary study will be that more research is needed. All too often, preliminary findings don&#x27;t lead to further useful discoveries in science, because the preliminary findings are flawed.

8565049,comment,8564471,8564471,0,0,jawns,,,"I came up with almost exactly this idea several years ago -- I called it augmented representative democracy.<p>I figured that software programmers would immediately latch onto the concept, because they are familiar with the concept of inheritance.  You elect a legislator to vote on your behalf, and in many situations that legislator&#x27;s vote is the same as your own, yet you retain the right to cast your own vote on any given issue.<p>But there are several objections that I could not overcome:<p>1) In our free, open, representative-style government, each legislator&#x27;s voting record is a matter of public record, but each individual citizen&#x27;s voting record is confidential. If we were to switch to augmented representative democracy, the question arises: Do we make each citizen&#x27;s voting record public or private? Both options come with potential problems. For instance, if all votes are private, we lose out on transparency, and anonymity tends to embolden people to make some pretty nasty choices. (Exhibit A: Any online forum.) But if all votes are public, it could invite retribution that the average citizen is not equipped to handle.<p>2) It&#x27;s hard enough to monitor roughly 535 federal legislators, to make sure they&#x27;re not taking bribes or kickbacks in exchange for their votes on particular pieces of legislation. Could you imagine if you had to instead monitor all 207.6 million eligible voters?  True, it also becomes more difficult to influence a significant number of them through nefarious means. (Suppose you need to bribe five senators to tip the scale in your favor on a particular piece of legislation. So you offer them each $1 million. Now suppose every eligible voter got to weigh in. You&#x27;d need to bribe more than 10 million of them, assuming they all voted. And a $1 bribe isn&#x27;t nearly as attractive as a $1 million bribe.)  But on bills where the vote is really, really close ... there is really no viable way to keep everybody honest.<p>3) A legislator&#x27;s workload is (or should be) a full-time job. It takes a lot of time to read through bills and understand them. It takes even more time to fully consider its broader implications and its potential unintended consequences. As part of that process, you&#x27;ll likely have to engage in discourse with fellow legislators; evaluate expert testimony; listen to the concerns of constituents, trade groups, lobbyists, and other organizations; and weigh the potential for the law to be challenged as unconstitutional. All of that takes time, and it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect every eligible voter to assume that responsibility for the purpose of voting on policy directly.<p>4) In practice, the cases in which this augmented representative democracy would result in a vote different from the legislator&#x27;s would be relatively few -- and yet there would be a whole lot of extra effort required to support the system.  Basically, you would need an issue where the legislator&#x27;s vote is different than what the people who elected him would expect (and the legislator, if he wants to be re-elected, is only going to do that sparingly), and you would need a substantial turnout of people willing to overrule him.  Considering how few people vote in general elections, that&#x27;s a tall order.<p>5) When you break it down, augmented representative democracy is really direct democracy, and not true representative democracy.  And one objection to direct democracy -- take it for what it&#x27;s worth -- is that there&#x27;s a danger of mob-mentality policy decisions.  If you look at some historic decisions, at least here in the U.S., the legislature was a bit ahead of the curve, compared with the population at large.  So ... I guess the question is ... could direct democracy have derailed or delayed something like the civil rights legislation of the mid-20th century?",1415232319

That is not a reason to not consider them.<p>In a delegative democracy, decision making is a lot more fluid than in the current system.  You can buy or coerce someone for one specific issue, but the impact of that will be lower than buying a Senator.

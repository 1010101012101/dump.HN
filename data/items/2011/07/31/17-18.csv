Direct Democracy sounds like something idealistic that would never work in practice, but that's only because people think of it to the extreme - as in literally the whole population deciding what laws need to pass and so on. And I don't think you should look at it like that, and instead using it as a scale - how <i>direct</i> do you want it to be exactly? Where are the specific situations where people can directly influence legislation and governance?<p>The current representatives in all countries seem to have gotten out of hand, and they mostly do what they want, especially if it's an issue that threatens their power.<p>To most young people voting seems pointless because they know it's a very weak form of feedback to vote a ""party"", and it's a feedback that happens too rarely. This is why they couldn't care less anymore about who get to be the next country leaders.<p>If they could engage a lot more with the representatives, and feel like they helped shape a certain legislation, I think they will become a lot more enthusiastic about it. They'd also like politicians to be a lot more accountable, because too many times they get away with voting for legislation that isn't for the benefit of the population at all, neither in the short term, nor in the long term. Warren Buffet seems to agree with politicians becoming more accountable, too.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNEp7q30JCw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNEp7q30JCw</a>",1312134512

The first and foremost is a monopoly on violence by the state. This is, in fact, demanded by the citizens who have a lot to lose if companies et al. were also allowed to pursue their interests by brandishing weapons. Thus, the first regulation is that companies cannot pursue their interests via force.<p>Thus, we are already out of the perfect world imagined by Austrian economists and exposing the simplistic lie that their worldview entails -- the social union that is the state is not merely a machine but, in the American republic, exists by the consent of the governed. Consequently, it has the power to issue additional regulations deemed to be in the interests of the governed, of which one might be that there be a single national currency, a single national language, etc. This is because our state is rooted in a Lockean social contract (with undoubtedly a good sprinkling of Hobbes).<p>Now, the precise nature of the regulations and whether or not they serve the people and whether or not they are consistent with the founding documents and accompanying intentions of the Republic is not always clear. Nonetheless, I think it is clear enough that at least in the American republic (if not a Randian inspired anti-state) that regulations are sometimes an answer to various problems.<p>Consequently, I would argue that if the SEC was able to attract and retain top talent and execute on its mandate it would have been able to stop this sub-prime nonsense in its tracks long before the present bubble burst and infected the rest of the economy with its TARPy bile.

2828942,comment,2827349,2828169,1,0,ScottBurson,,,"Of course you are right that CFS is a catch-all term for what is probably a number of conditions.  If you say that you had something that fell under that rubric that you are sure was of emotional origin, I would be the last to argue with you.<p>But what you need to hear, evidently, is that a common cause, I would guess the <i>most</i> common cause, of symptoms that also fall, for lack of better diagnosis, under this category, is clearly organic.  I didn't come up with the idea of taking valacyclovir myself; drugs in this class are being used to treat this particular type of CFS by researchers such as Jos Montoya at Stanford Medical School:<p><a href=""http://med.stanford.edu/news_releases/2007/january/montoya.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://med.stanford.edu/news_releases/2007/january/montoya.h...</a><p>So the fact that ""CFS"" is really a catch-all for several poorly-understood conditions is really the key point.  You can see from that link (fourth paragraph from the bottom) that researchers like Montoya are keenly aware of this.  The Economist story, in contrast, leaves the impression that Wessely is approaching CFS as a unitary condition; this could be the reporter's error, but it doesn't much matter: the story is still objectionable.<p>You are actually the first person I have seen on the Net saying that you have been diagnosed with CFS that you are convinced is psychogenic.  Again, I have no desire to argue with you about your own case.  I think, though, that cases like yours are a minority among CFS sufferers, probably a small minority.  (Stories like mine are not hard to find at all.)<p>But as far as who is holding whom back, I couldn't disagree more.  Firstly, I know the connection between EBV and (many cases of) CFS has been suspected for at least 20 years, because I have found historical references to the possible connection.  Acyclovir, the first of this class of antivirals, dates back at least to 1982.  Yet it's only in the last few years that doctors like Montoya have been experimenting with antivirals for CFS.  I think that part of the reason it has taken so long has been the belief, at one time fairly widespread in the medical community, that CFS is always of psychogenic origin.<p>Secondly, I don't know what kind of research someone like Wessely could do that would be of any help to you.  What you need, by your own argument, is a therapist to help you get in touch with the emotions whose repression is causing your symptoms.  What could Wessely do to facilitate this process?<p>I would ask you to be careful when throwing around statements like ""They enjoy having a label they can hide behind"".  While this could be true in some cases, you don't know that these people don't have an EBV or HHV-6 infection, or some other physiological problem.<p>And I don't know how you would think that I would ""mock and denigrate"" people with CFS.  The only people I am mocking and denigrating are those who claim that CFS is <i>necessarily always</i> psychogenic.  I have CFS myself, did you get that?  (And BTW my doctor agrees; he's tested me for everything else; this isn't just a self-diagnosis.)",1312134049

From about 1999 (right out of high school) until 2008.<p>In response to the OP, zedshaw and a couple of others (who make good points), I'd say:<p>* obviously if you're good at your job in HFT after a while you don't have to work 100 hour weeks. People wait for you. There are levels of support. You still get woken up once in a while, but not if the firm is well structured and the support training / delegation is good.<p>* people are right in that the closer you are to the money, the more financial upside (and downside) you usually have.<p>* there are some very mediocre programmers, like in any sector -- however, they tend to not last as long because the trading side is very demanding (in terms of quality) and that filters down pretty quickly.<p>* do the people who really know what they're doing in the trading and HFT space have an OCD level of awareness of all levels of their code? sometimes. and it's easy to then conclude that this must not be found in other fields/areas. i can't speak for the rest of the world, but there are exceptions everywhere i've been.<p>in fact, i wouldn't even say it's the norm that in HFT people are more capable of deep diving into assembly or whatever. however, basically there are a handful of people in HFT who have been fortunate enough to grow up in that industry and have made mistakes without being fired -- and those people are very bright and careful about their code, and the large purchasing price for quality/reliability and quickness delivered does affect things on a macro scale probably. there's also basically a lot of hard-core russian programmers (from the many different technical universities in russia) who are quite rigorous with their code and trust the idea of finance more than the idea of startups or silicon valley even -- but this is probably a generalization (just my experience perhaps).<p>most software rewriting is trivial once you know what you have to do. and most software projects don't 'know what they have to do' until half way through. i used to work with a guy who made a point of rewriting ALL trading-related code every two years. another guy didn't trust OSS because he thought it was mostly hobbyist. they're both sort of wrong -- but it's a different culture/mindset. and these guys weren't idiots. respectively, they were some of the lead developers / architects for some of the largest algorithmic shops in chicago.<p>but my point is that programming for HFT or real-time trading requires that you really know what you're doing down to each line of code, so that you can react when things do break (and they will break). if you can't react quickly, you will eventually not find yourself on interesting projects and you might even get fired.<p>so ironically you have to slow down and really get to know how to do programming very carefully, and then scale that up so that you can react really quickly later (with something like binary search). this is a useful thing to practice in some ways. other people probably learn variants of it in other fields.<p>* the recession hit large parts of the financial sector pretty hard. i went back and visited chicago somewhat recently (now work in SV). i can't speak to everyone, but if i were an undergraduate or someone trying to figure out career trajectories for the first time, i would feel much more secure in even the startup space than in financial services at this point. because you know most of that is going to be replaced (with automated, distributed technology) in our lifetime.",1312133973

Let's break it down:<p>(1) Don't let fear rule your life\n(2) Given your ability to earn, your needs are modest\n(3) From your post, you seem to have a reasonable perspective\n(4) The added paperwork may be annoying<p>(1) Fear will tell you to stick with your ""reliable"" salaried position.  I am unfamiliar with Scandinavian employment laws; however, in the US, job security simply doesn't exist.<p>What I tell folks: ""Everyone is a freelancer -- some people realize it and most don't"".  What I mean: you are responsible for your career and for marketing your skills.  You can't count on other people to do it for you.<p><i>You want to mitigate as many risks as possible to reduce fear</i>.<p>* You already have a nest egg.<p>* You know how much you need to earn each month<p>* Do you already have clients lined up?  If possible, I'd recommend having more than one at a time.  This can get complicated, trying to satisfy 2 or more clients' needs while leaving time for your own (bootstrapping, et al).  However, if you tell each client up front that ""I can allocate up to 15 hours/week for you"" and they're on board with that then you only need 2 clients.  This will help keep  the income steady.<p>* Even with a nest egg, burning savings while sitting on the bench is not good for the stress level (see the latter part of my previous bullet).<p>(2) Are Scandinavian businesses able to find (enough) full time hires with your skill set?  If not, the market is ready for you.  If so, you may need to be a little more flexible.<p>(3) You don't come off as an arrogant jerk (quite the opposite).  WIN! ;-)<p>(4) Be prepared to do more paperwork.  You will be your own business.  Find out what this entails in your country.  In the US, it means <i>more</i> taxes, finding and paying for my own health insurance, invoicing, and other tedium.  <i>This can take up 5-10 hours/week of your time at first</i>.  It gets better over time.<p>About me: I've been freelancing for a couple of years in the US and have been in the industry perhaps a little longer (just over 16 years).  I tend to act as a ""consultant"" in addition to a ""contractor"": beyond just slinging code, I also providing ""coaching"" to individuals and teams.

2828911,comment,2828587,2828857,6,0,Jd,,,"It is more than ""what many Chinese firms"" are doing; it is what the Chinese government in collusion with many Chinese firms is actively doing all the time at all levels of US infrastructure, including not only industrial espionage but also actively attempting to steal all military and other tech from every server connected to the internet. Everything stolen is then pushed back to the appropriate vendor, which includes of course whatever companies are capable of producing stolen tech. This then is produced at low cost overseas and shipped back to the American consumer, who purchases it at the expense of an American product, leading to a loss in revenues for the American company that originally designed and produced the stolen product and dozens or hundreds more unemployed Americans.<p>This isn't MAD, this is constant low-level warfare waged by a foreign power without <i>any</i> US response except for monitoring and sporadic defensive efforts. The problem with a counter-offensive, esp. one waged by proxy private sector forces is that, first of all, the US is continually fighting the last war over and over (oh yes, let's invade Libya and setup democracy there... ), second of all even if we can plant detonation devices in Chinese infrastructure like they most certainly have littered in ours (who knows how many electric grids they could shut off at a moment's notice) this doesn't prevent their offensive efforts at all. In fact, the only thing that can prevent theft on a large scale is penalizing that theft, which certainly no current administration is capable of doing (notice the long standing list of promises regarding IP protection that China has reneged on). So really the only solution here is to innovate much more quickly domestically (including whatever private sector partnerships are appropriate via DARPA, etc.) and to continue to develop offensive capacities (which undoubtedly exist but given the classified nature of such, it is hard to know quite how well developed or capable they are). Undoubtedly we should also try to knock off Chinese government servers periodically as they do to ours just to be certain that we can -- and a private Blackwater might be just the ticket.<p>Oh yes, I used to work for the DoD.",1312133558

What a lot of people don't know is that there a special visa for Australians to work in the US, called an E3 [1] that (IIRC) came about only 5-8 years ago as part of a settlement of a trade dispute (basically the US blocks Australian wheat imports on quarantine grounds but the real issue is Australian agriculture isn't subsidized and is competitive with US agriculture, which is hugely subsidized).<p>Anyway, an E3 visa is actually MUCH easier to get than a H1B visa. For a H1B visa you have to ""prove"" that the job qualifies (Labor certification) and that you can't find anyone locally to do it. The first part is a formality (getting an LCA from the Department of Labor). The second is the hard and expensive part.<p>For an E3, you only need to do the first part.<p>So if you can't find people locally, consider employing Australians.

Since this thread has already dropped off the front page, and it probably wont be seen by many people, Ive also posted it at <a href=""http://bosker.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/something-i-dont-understand-about-homomorphic-encryption/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bosker.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/something-i-dont-und...</a><p>The homomorphic encryption techniques seem to allow the computation of arbitrary polynomials over various finite rings, and  at least in everything Ive read  its always treated as obvious that this is equivalent to allowing arbitrary computations. Is that actually true? If so, is it really obvious? Id love some enlightenment here.<p>A related source of confusion is that clearly any encryption scheme that <em>actually</em> supported arbitrary computations on encrypted values would be hopelessly insecure. For example, suppose you have encrypted a ten-character ascii password. I then run the function that extracts the first character. The result I get is still encrypted, but since there are only 128 possible values for an ascii character, I can encrypt each of these values and compare the result to the result of my computation. (I can do this because I can always encrypt any data of my choice, just by running a constant-valued function inside the encryption.) Then I do the same for the second character, and so on, till I have your complete password. Encryption fail!<p>The only reasonable conclusion I can draw from this is that fully homomorphic encryption does not really permit arbitrary computations on the encrypted data. In that case,<p>1. Why do people keep saying it does?\n2. What is the class of computations that are in fact permitted? Is it just the evaluation of polynomials?<p>Anyone?",1312132518

The government connections keep them from being regulated but don't adequately explain how they can skim so much off the top. For instance, how do the big firms (e.g. Goldman) manage to get into oil futures, create new fangled products that others will buy, get everyone to follow them into the same market sector, raise the price of oil, pocket billions of dollars, and leave the market before it goes south. It's actually hundreds of years of accumulated know-how in a somewhat needed but mostly bogus market sector -- of which the first priority is how to convince very intelligent and hard working people that they are doing some admirable or at least neutral when they are in fact destroying the economic base of the country they are in, siphoning all of the talent into meaningless and counterproductive tasks, and pouring their money into the political machine in order to increase corruption so they will never be held accountable for their actions.<p>The short answer is an excellent understanding of human psychology leading to good marketing. Most criminals think they aren't doing something wrong. Most people can be trained to do very damaging (even evil) actions by acculturation and habituation. Americans have been re-educated in the past fifty years to think that all sorts of things are okay that they never would have thought when we were the industrial superpower that invented and produced everything imaginable (e.g. car, plane, tv, space shuttles, etc.). Of course, most of these changes in American thinking aren't politically correct to mention.<p>Nowadays people either go into finance or work on some little web startup in the hopes they will make a billion dollars -- but at least that is better than being a patent troll. The AirBnB scandal is in fact a great example of the present dynamic. It is a great service on top of existing infrastructure. That's basically all Americans do these days -- a service economy on top of actual products that are increasingly being produced elsewhere.  Sometimes those services are good, sometimes not so good, but barely anyone actually builds anything that is made to last -- nor do they seem to care.<p>Wake up America!",1312132183

The company can accept or refuse. After 12 months, the employee can decide to leave the company for good (business works) or return to his former functions and keep his job/salary (business doesn't work, founder is not fit, crisis in the world- you name it).<p>I oversimplified it a bit of course, but basically you should check out if there are any system like this one in your country. I personally took this chance and I am freelance right now under these terms. I already had a contract ready to execute when I started, which helped tons.<p>Just one thing: expect up to 3 months delays in payments and expect administrative delays (at least three weeks, for me it was two months- don't ask) from the moment you have a bank backing you up until you can issue your first invoice: that's what it takes to incorporate a company. So worst case scenario is even if you start with a gig right away, you might have to eat all your saved up cash before seeing any money income.<p>Looking back at how it went for me, I would have rather started working on all the administrative details before leaving my previous company.

This author doesn't.<p>What always using fast-forward merges <i>really</i> means is that you rebase each branch onto master once it's ready to be public. Therefore, instead of resolving conflicts when the branch is merged, the commits are rewritten to avoid introducing the conflict in the first place.<p>Sometimes, this is really simple -- I added a line in one spot, you added another line in the same spot, you merged first, so I rewrite my commit to add my line next to yours instead of merging and resolving the conflict. Sometimes, it's not -- maybe there's not even any text-level conflict, but your feature and my feature interact in subtle and unanticipated ways and something breaks. Now, there's no ""good"" point in my branch to refer to, because I rewrote it on top of something where (I didn't realize) it was never really going to work. The unit test I now need couldn't have existed because it involves things that, when I was developing the branch, didn't exist.<p>Rebasing first is trading off <i>when</i> you do that work. There's more to review when the branch is ready, and there's a stronger incentive to get it right the first time. I think this may work better for the ""two founders deploying from master when they feel like it"" scenario -- you pay for manageability with context switches. If you have a formal QA process, I think being able to distinguish between ""this branch failed QA"" and ""the combination of these branches failed"" may be more helpful -- you can parallelize work and hack on a different private branch.<p>Git, thankfully, does not force us to choose one model or the other :-)",1312131981

No need for drivers for anything else.<p>- There is exactly one user with OS-level access and he can be trusted completely. (This is many servers already: the only OS-level user is the sysadmin, all non-root accounts ever do us sudo to a root shell.)<p>- This VM runs exactly one process (the actual application) and it can have direct access to hardware and memory. So no (or drastically reduced) need for memory protection, process scheduling, system calls, etc.<p>It&#x27;s likely that i.e. a relational database engine with direct access to SSD firmware can be made faster than one which must go through a generic filesystem abstraction layer.<p>Disadvantages:<p>- Largely uncharted waters<p>- Linux is likely to be better at intelligently scheduling resources than a hypervisor, at least for the forseeable future.",1436252388

I dutifully went through several pages, trying to find something non-boring, and it was indeed all boring (with the exception of Bruegel, who shouldn&#x27;t be in there).<p>Interestingly, I feel the same way about many works on ArtStation [1]. The artists try to draw something &quot;cool&quot;, like a fantasy creature, but end up with just a basic picture of a human with lots of greebles [2]. Lack of imagination is very obvious.<p>At the other end of the spectrum for me is something like Wayne Barlowe&#x27;s &quot;Wargate&quot; [3], an image with a whole new visual language for what it&#x27;s trying to say, or Paul Veer&#x27;s pixel art for Nuclear Throne [4], with very simple technique but very imaginative character designs.

9843983,comment,9841209,9843269,0,0,rfugger,,,"Go see a good doctor that will be thorough in checking all other probably causes of fatigue.  You should probably end up seeing a few specialists as well.  The major symptom of CFS is post-exertional malaise, meaning you feel worse after sufficient exertion.<p>While you wait through what may be many months of medical testing before everything is ruled out, you might try an experiment.  Exercise usually helps depression, but usually worsens CFS.  Try a bit of gentle exercise, and work your way up gradually over time until you can sustain some intensity.  If that improves your fatigue, that&#x27;s good news, it could be depression, and keep up the exercise.  If you feel worse, more depressed, confused, fatigued, with trouble concentrating, that could be post-exertional malaise.  Try taking it extremely easy for a few months (maybe many months).  Don&#x27;t do anything that feels like you&#x27;re pushing yourself.  If you start to feel better, if your fatigue and mood start to lift, and you are able to concentrate better, then it could be CFS, and keep up the gentle pacing.<p>Also, if your fatigue came on after a relatively severe viral infection, that would point to CFS as well.",1436252174

It like scheme in that it&#x27;s great for meta programming and creating higher level domain specific languages, but its approach is different enough and much lower level than Scheme that it&#x27;s worth learning scheme as well as forth, to contrast them for a better perspective.<p>Another interesting related language is PostScript, which is a lot like Forth in some ways (rpn stack based, separate return and parameter (and dictionary scope) stacks, how the threaded interpreter works, and its extreme simplicity and power) but a lot like scheme in other ways (data is code, polymorphic arrays and dictionaries, typed object references instead of raw untyped pointers, with typed objects bound to names in dictionaries as opposed to typed variables holding values (you can redefine the same name to different types, since the object with its type is associated with the key in a dict, the type is not declared for the variable name itself like C), a safe high level language with bounds checking, garbage collection (in a modern implementation -- old printers tend to use simpler heaps), etc).<p>PostScript (and scheme) is a lot more of a &quot;black box&quot; than Forth is, since there&#x27;s a lot of magic stuff going on under the hood that you can&#x27;t see, to make it seem simple on the surface. And I&#x27;d say that on the surface, PostScript is simpler than Forth, because of how it&#x27;s higher level and you don&#x27;t have to worry about a lot of details. But Forth is actually extremely simple all the way down!<p><pre><code>    \ First you should:\n    FORTH ?KNOW IF\n        HONK!\n    ELSE\n        FORTH LEARN!\n    THEN\n\n    \ Then you can:\n    BEGIN\n        FORTH THINK!\n    AGAIN</code></pre>",1436251693

9843954,comment,9804777,9836707,0,0,SilasX,,,">This is probably the only point of disagreement here. If I understand your critique of the O(1) result, it&#x27;s that addressing n elements takes arithmetic (hashing) on numbers of log n bits.<p>It&#x27;s not the addressing I object to -- this whole domain consistently assumes O(1) seek times. It&#x27;s the computation of the hash itself. A hash function that, by supposition, minimizes collisions is going to have to avalanche the whole thing such that it has to perform a complex calculation -- not mere lookup -- that incorporates multiple combinations of the elements. The growth in cost is not from doing seeks over bigger ranges but from computation. You can no more assume away that growth than you can assume that md5 is just as expensive than SHA256.<p>>ISTM that, assuming an integer RAM model, that same critique must apply to any input. A mere pointer into an array of n elements has log n bits, so just incrementing and testing the pointer can&#x27;t be O(1), and even iterating that array can&#x27;t be O(n).<p>I never objected to this before but I&#x27;ve always disagreed: iterating needn&#x27;t be log(n) because any such procedure can be optimized away to get the next element via either a) a seek, or b) incremeting a value, which is constant amortized (because bit rollover is exponentially rare).",1436251545

There is not enough information here to formulate a scientific conclusion but there is enough information to form a reasonable one.<p>That being said... consensus will differ based on the situation, but based on the information given the consensus is roughly the same: Don&#x27;t betray your best friend. There are very few contexts where having an affair with your best friends girlfriend will be justifiably moral. Let me address some of the examples you gave:<p>The nature and context of the relationship between the boyfriend and the girlfriend itself is irrelevant and NONE of the OPs business. Although an abusive relationship justifies intervention, an unhappy relationship DOES NOT JUSTIFY AN AFFAIR. Intuitively, it is also highly Unlikely that the relationship is abusive. Make no mistake, anytime you engage in an affair with your best friends girlfriend it is most likely an act of utter betrayal.<p>If the OP was not intentionally seducing the girl but developed feelings naturally, it is the OPs&#x27; own business. It&#x27;s not his fault he developed those feelings but it will be his fault if he acts on those feelings. He is now torn between his attraction to this woman and his guilt for betraying his friend hence his decision to query people on hackernews. We all have dark desires, but the desire itself does not justify the action.<p>I fixate on the affair itself and how the act of carrying out said affair is an act of betrayal. The situation and context of the action is not uniformly immoral and I can definitely empathize with the OP. However, despite all of this... you are still an ass hole if you have an affair with your best friends girlfriend.

If they expect their users to be able to use it, I think they can expect the same from their employees. It&#x27;s likely not a wasted effort to learn it as they might need it somewhere else as well.<p>The Stack Exchange blog was hacked a few years ago, I suspect that was part of the motivation to switch to something they know better.",1436248927

Is it supposed to be combined with a numerical toolbox, so that&#x27;s why a fast compiled language is used? I could see the value in that, the mismatch between Matlab and HPC is annoying, i.e. porting numerical code from Matlab to Fortran to make it fast, is not fun. Then again I&#x27;m not sure whether the C# runtime is efficient enough for HPC purposes, there isn&#x27;t really much research going that way AFAIK - could be an interesting topic since I&#x27;m not convinced that the current trifecta of C(++) and Fortran is the final answer.",1436248903

The whole problem here was that those subs were not restricting themselves to posting within the sub. They were harassing people outside of the sub.<p>According to one of the Reddit admins[1], all of the banned subs had &quot;numerous complaints that they were harassing people both on and off Reddit&quot;.<p>The problem here was not that they were saying mean things on the internet, as you seem to be claiming. The problem was that they were very legitimately harassing people outside of the subreddit. The people being harassed did not have to visit the sub in order to see it, and didn&#x27;t even have to visit Reddit. And that&#x27;s what makes it harassment, and what makes it against the rules of Reddit.<p>[1] ekjp, I think this was somewhere in the same thread where he posted <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/removing_harassing_subreddits/cs21aj4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/39bpam/remov...</a>",1436248883

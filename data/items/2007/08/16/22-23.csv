43246,comment,43124,43220,0,0,brent,,,"No, AdSense is a business model in which there is a simple javascript widget interface.  The model is money in exchange for advertising across billions(?) of websites.  A startup is created and launched when there is a business model that uses the widget.  Otherwise its a programming exercise.  Any reasonable programmer can create a program in <10 hours, but unless there is a business model it is not a startup.",1187304373

43226,comment,43118,43177,0,0,wanorris,,,"Agriculture is not exactly the <i>reason</i> for technological advances; rather, progress became <i>possible</i> (but not guaranteed!) thanks to agriculture.<p>While a few hunter-gatherer societies lived in a place so abundant that they can settle in a single location and gather everything they needed, the vast majority of such societies were migratory, moving to wherever the food was. <p>In a migratory society, most technological advances are simply not useful. When you only keep the things you can carry on your back, anything that doesn't have a direct use is an active hindrance with a quantifiable opportunity cost. Civilization is only possible when people can settle in one place.<p>Further, even hunter-gatherer societies that are fortunate enough to settle in a single place have to remain small to survive, or they exceed their food supply. This means that the chance of a given society developing a new technology is much smaller (given a smaller supply of creative individuals). It also means that even if a society <i>does</i> develop a new technology, that technology spreads very slowly, leading to less cross-pollination with other individuals and ideas.<p>By contrast, agriculture concentrates people together. There are a variety of technologies that increased the productivity of an agricultural society as a whole, and it's very natural for those technologies to spread throughout a society. Furthermore, agricultural societies that are more productive than their neighbors can produce more soldiers (when a smaller percentage of the population can feed the whole society, there is excess labor for armies, as well as other pursuits), allowing them to conquer their neighbors and spread their advances to their newly conquered territories. Basically, in an agricultural society, technology spreads like a virus.",1187302295

43223,comment,43150,43191,0,0,ecuzzillo,,,"Well, okay, but the point of the normal free time argument is that agricultural people have more time, and are therefore able to do more stuff. My point is, it may not be the case that agricultural people have more time on average, but it <i>is</i> the case that agricultural societies give <i>enough</i> people free time to do many more interesting things, and especially, enough free time to concentrate in cities and do things they couldn't do while not in cities. Which more or less negates the whole agriculture-is-a-mistake argument; once you show that agriculture lets you do lots of amazing things in cities, you can argue that those things are worth the various bugs in agriculture (most of which eventually get fixed anyway).

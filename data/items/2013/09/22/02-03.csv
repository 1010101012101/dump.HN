We want the lessons and challenges to be fun, and to actually product something that the user can identify with (very often, an animal or food :-), but we also don&#x27;t want to sacrifice teaching the concept in a clear way. For example, today we debated how to do our intro to loops tutorial, and we found that the clearest example wasn&#x27;t nearly as fun as other possible ones - but it <i>was</i> the most clear, and for something like loops, we want to be really really clear when the student is first wrapping their head around it.

(The $100k limit simply causes them to open a lot of accounts. Which is why you have mint.com to keep track of it all, I guess. But any rich person will have 4-5 $99999 balance accounts, and have 4-5 of them in multiple countries (US, EU, Switzerland, Dubai, Australia for example), and they know why.

You call the helpdesk for cox, they come and repair your cable modem, but somehow they &quot;blame&quot; the problem on you, and that&#x27;s $250 for riding out thank you very much.<p>Now let&#x27;s assess what happens in 3 situations :\n1) you have a bank account\n  - the money&#x27;s gone the moment they say you spent it with them\n  - you have no recourse\n  - you call them\n  - they&#x27;ve got everything they want, you have zero negotiating position\n  - even if you achieve the impossible and talk them out of it, the money&#x27;s gone for 2+ months\n2) you pay by credit card (obviously only available to &quot;the rich&quot;, granted, not quite &quot;the 1%&quot;, but I&#x27;m pretty sure >20% of Americans effectively don&#x27;t have access to a credit card)\n  - the money&#x27;s gone the moment they charge you\n  - you call them up, ask what&#x27;s going on, they don&#x27;t cooperate\n  - you threaten them with a chargeback\n  - they will suddenly become very cooperative\n3) you don&#x27;t have a back account (with positive balance)\n  - their payment request bounces\n  - they have no recourse\n  - they call you and ask if there&#x27;s anything they can do\n  - they&#x27;re pretty cooperative<p>The &quot;mystery&quot; of why poor people, students, ... go with option 3 is not much of a mystery to me.

6425602,comment,6424692,6425241,2,0,ericd,,,"I agree with your opinion of law clerks as generally competent people, which probably extends somewhat to technology with the younger set.<p>That said, I know a lot of young, competent engineers and scientists who know next to nothing about the workings of computers and networks. They could figure out a lot if they had the time to put into it (I&#x27;ve seen a couple switch into development successfully), but usually they don&#x27;t and their knowledge is of the surface-level stuff. That could still help with gut checks about what&#x27;s reasonable behavior online for a casual user, but it&#x27;s far from the nuanced understanding necessary to understand the ramifications of and make calls about things like the various applications of the CFAA in cases involving more advanced users.<p>Most people are not curious about technology and generally don&#x27;t have a good understanding other people&#x27;s curiosity about the subject. Should they be the ones to judge whether someone was just playing around or trying to attack something? Or should it be people with that curiosity who have had experience in playing around with security?<p>I would say that programmers&#x27; interpretation of the law via intent and current context in tech cases is frequently more consistent with what a just society needs than most judges&#x27; attempts at maintaining consistency with past rulings until a higher circuit corrects the precedent. I wouldn&#x27;t dismiss the whole class as overenthusiastic amateurs.<p>I may just not be seeing the value in the judges&#x27; attempts at finding consistency, though, and I&#x27;m curious as to why they strive so hard for it versus trying to find the correct interpretation. My understanding is that that&#x27;s just an attribute of the common law system. If someone could tell me why that&#x27;s valuable (perhaps for consistency of enforcement/predictability of outcomes?), that&#x27;d be great.

I don&#x27;t mean this just in a big sense, I mean this in a very small, day to day sense, week to week sense.<p>I like to think of each product feature as a &quot;marketing event&quot;. Before you add a feature or do a release, you design things around how you are going to sell it, how people will use it, and what the messaging might be for it. Then, when you launch the feature, you email your users, blog about it, drop press releases, go on podcasts, tweet the news, post to Facebook, and in general get the word out.<p>This might seem basic to some people, but I&#x27;m continually surprised by just how very little this is done by most companies or products. It is rare to see a company that nails the basic concept of &quot;do things and tell people&quot;.<p>Github seems consistently good about this. Their pattern is launch a feature, blog about it, tweet about it, and their passionate users probably post it to social media or write about it on their blogs.<p>Now, imagine if Github shipped the same features, but never blogged about them.

6425569,comment,6423846,6424631,10,0,rayiner,,,"By and large, comparing chemical engineering to software development is misguided. Software development isn&#x27;t an engineering field, i.e. the application of a refined theoretical framework to a concrete problem. It&#x27;s more like carpentry. There&#x27;s a few basic theoretical principles, but by and large it&#x27;s just building things. You can spend a lifetime becoming an expert carpenter, and that can be very valuable, but nobody gets a PhD in carpentry because by and large there&#x27;s not much there that&#x27;s theoretically interesting.<p>There are many areas that are theoretically rigorous, of course. Machine-learning/AI, crypto/security, graphics, audio, video, etc, and unsurprisingly a PhD is quite valuable for programmers in those fields.",1379817499

Everyday I come in and I always feel like I have something to learn from the people I work with. I feel like I grow as a person because I&#x27;m constantly learning new things from my peers - whether that be something purely theoretical, hands-on electronics work, cleanroom work, machine shop work, optics work, or, yes, <i>coding</i>. Could the same be true in industry? Absolutely. Is it nearly as guaranteed? I&#x27;m sure not. I definitely have friends that are starting to gain the golden handcuffs at their companies, and they&#x27;ve only been working for 2 years.<p>Moreover, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to say that people waste their time doing a PhD in physics. Sure, they could be learning a lot more job-specific skills, but the point is that the people who do a PhD in physics absolutely have the ability to learn those things. I&#x27;m sure if the physicist used PCA it wouldn&#x27;t take him long to learn plenty of other ML techniques. I think the skills you learn during a PhD aren&#x27;t as simple as just listing out the technical things you became familiar with. (Still, I&#x27;m certainly considering leaving grad school, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s an obvious decision.)<p>Of course, I think there is a lot more to a job than the technical skills you bring to the table --- your ability to communicate, your understanding of the market & product, and your ability to work well with others. (Yes, I&#x27;m fully aware physics people don&#x27;t often hold gold medals in these categories).

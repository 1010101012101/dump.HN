That&#x27;s just insulting.&quot;<p>What Prof. Chang means by this is that she believes minorities are published because of the quality of their work, and anyone who suggests that they&#x27;re published simply because they&#x27;re minorities is wrong and motivated by a belief that minorities&#x27; work does not stand on its own merits, which would indeed be insulting.<p>If this white guy announced, &quot;I&#x27;m going to use a Chinese-sounding pen name because I think it&#x27;ll make my poems more likely to be published,&quot; then yeah, I think a case could be made that it&#x27;s insulting, because he would be <i>presuming</i> that minorities&#x27; work does not stand on its own merits.<p>But in this case, the white guy did not make a racist statement.  What he did was demonstrate that in at least one case, the Chinese-sounding name <i>did</i> influence whether his poems were published.<p>So, if it&#x27;s insulting, it&#x27;s insulting not because of what this man said or did.  Rather, it&#x27;s insulting on the part of the publications, who <i>did</i> judge the poems on something other than their merits.",1441763812

It explains all the symptoms mentioned in the article.<p>Kids in kindergarten start early, and stay later than they have in the past with no nap period. Busy parents (both of whom are now working full-time) are lucky to get home by 7pm, so the kid(s) are generally kept up till 9/10pm so the parents can have some time with them.<p>If parents are going to keep a 5/6-yr old up to 9:30pm or later, then wake them up at 7:15am to get ready for school at 8:15am.... which goes till 2pm with no nap time. Well yea, sleep deprivation hurts.<p>Ask your parents, grandparents, etc when they went to sleep, when kindergarten began, how long it ran, whether it included a nap/rest-time. Most of us got a <i>lot</i> more sleep than the kids now.<p>Edit: I agree kids need more free-play time, but that&#x27;s separate from their sleep deprivation.",1441763795

In the end, a huge amount of money was spent and a couple hundred houses were hooked up to very low wattage systems shared by entire villages.<p>India announced they were going to produce a $15 computer for the masses of poor. Well we now have $15 computers, but not from this program, and India still is lacking stable electricity, clean water, and other basics throughout much of the nation.<p>&quot;The Philippines is planning free Wi-Fi services to half of its towns and cities this year and nationwide coverage by end-2016&quot;<p>So the claim being made is half the towns and cities by this year, 2015, within a few months. And total coverage by next year.<p>Most of the land area of the Philippines is remote and rural. Much is mountainous. It would be a remarkable engineering project to have total wifi coverage through the <i>entire</i> country by 2016. Accomplishing it with $32 million in funding would be especially amazing.<p>The chance that this will happen I estimate at 0%. The chance of a modest amount of coverage in certain neighborhoods of larger cities is good. Total coverage by next year isn&#x27;t going to happen, isn&#x27;t going to ever happen for the cited price, and the data point that it is being claimed it will happen by next year shows that those in charge of this program don&#x27;t understand the problem, which means that the actually doable claims (coverage for 50% of all towns and cities by December 2015) are questionable as well.",1441763473

They are backlit, and their response to better lighting in the room is <i>to increase its own strength to make itself even more apparent</i>. They are ugly, obnoxious, and annoying in the same way blinking router lights are, but multiplied several times over.<p>So we keep them off - we can <i>afford</i> to keep them on, but the fact that we keep them off 99% of the time less environmental consciousness but more an acknowledgment that they&#x27;re visually noisy, distracting, and just kind of don&#x27;t fit in.

It&#x27;s clearly legible, doesn&#x27;t require backlighting, and more importantly <i>doesn&#x27;t appear distractingly electronic</i> in everyday use.

It was a reflection that the resident set size (RSS) of a process is often a fraction of its Virtual Memory footprint (often an order of magnitude smaller), so a process could run effectively even with most of its data swapped out to disk.<p>There was a fair amount of interesting engineering to make swap effective.. For example, for the code (text) segment, which was read-only, you&#x27;d use the file itself (e.g. a.out) as the swap for the text (code) portion, and if you&#x27;d try to `rm a.out` while it was running, you&#x27;d get a &quot;text file busy error&quot;.",1441762602

Papert talks about &quot;body-syntonicity&quot; where the act of drawing a circle on the computer screen with LOGO can be seen as bridging children’s sense and knowledge about their own bodies to something abstract. Young children would often pretend to be the LOGO turtle, acting out commands on the floor, during stages of planning a LOGO program, or while debugging LOGO code.

Since then, developments in logic, statistics,
and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying
perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording
systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and
neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor
areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage
and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components – not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences.
Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and
stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common
frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do
such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection
(e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents
types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract
concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially
and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent
type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual
theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol
systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored&quot;",1441761135

[...] And if your mindset is always that <i>all work is bad</i>,<p>The first part is not inherently hateful towards working while the latter one is.<p>> Considering how much of your life you dedicate towards working, why the hell aren&#x27;t you making damn well sure it&#x27;s doing something that gives you at least a sense of fulfillment, if not outright joy.<p>Maybe they are. But people that say that they don&#x27;t &quot;live to work&quot; seem to be more in opposition to the mindset of viewing everything through the lens of productivity and utility. They are against the idea that free time is chiefly about &quot;recreation&quot;, ie about recharging your batteries/not burning out so that you can go back to being a fully productive worker bee at 9 am the next morning. In this &quot;recreation&quot; view, free time serves office time. In the view of &quot;I don&#x27;t live to work&quot;, work chiefly is about survival, and free time is about actually living.<p>Does that mean they are necessarily against finding fulfilling work? No: work can be life-affirming (though I realize that some people might have such a chip on their shoulder towards work that they will never see it that way). But it certainly means that they refuse to delude themselves into thinking that working 60 hours a week at a job they at best feel lukewarm about is their grand purpose in life.",1374928612

Long-term visa holders also have to sell the property at the end of their stay.[0] Australia also has a decent number of moderate-stay (<=12 months) temporary residents (working holiday, etc) that aren&#x27;t allowed to buy under FIRB guidelines, or don&#x27;t have the fiscal means, both of which increase demand for rentals.<p>I strongly doubt whether the increasing price of housing is sustainable. If it&#x27;s increasing beyond that of inflation, it&#x27;s a bubble and people simply just aren&#x27;t going to be able to afford it. People on the upswing of any market become complacent that prices will always continue to rise, but this isn&#x27;t necessarily true. The future is yet to be determined, and who knows what will happen.<p>I have known landlords who have had their properties vacant for several months at a time. Their mortgages continued though and this put a lot of pressure on them financially. There&#x27;s also the issue of tenants that end up not paying, or paying late, etc.<p>You&#x27;re not wrong and your strategy has a strong superficial appeal: property ownership with flexibility! Properties can be rented out, it&#x27;s possible to find great long-term tenants, and it&#x27;s even possible to break even or make a slight profit as an amateur landlord. Your strategy can be made to work, it&#x27;s just the costs probably aren&#x27;t worth it unless you&#x27;re a landlord with a good number of properties. I&#x27;d argue the actual flexibility is marginal compared to renting; if I want to leave my rented property, I can do so quite easily and with minimal moving costs. I do appreciate the cost of this flexibility too though: I&#x27;m paying someone else&#x27;s mortgage with nothing to show for it in the long term. Also, owning has the distinct advantage of control: nobody&#x27;s going to be a more accommodating landlord to me than me!<p>[0] This assumes that the property is a second-hand dwelling, not one bought from a new developer, or been renovated, or any of the other exceptions that come to mind.",1374926508

It happens that today's spelling checkers are generally just non-word detectors. This doesn't mean that anyone <i>defines</i> ""misspelled"" to mean ""misspelled in such a way that the result is not a word at all"".<p>And yes, a non-word detector is still very useful, and it's much much easier to make than something that also determines reliably when words are misspelled in ways that produce other words, so there's lots of software out there (perhaps essentially all of it) that contains only a non-word detector.<p>I think it's perfectly reasonable to define ""spelling checker"" to include mere non-word detectors. Or for that matter non-common-word detectors. (I expect most spelling checkers will reject ""hight"", and very sensibly because if someone types that they probably meant ""high"" or ""height"" or something -- but it's a perfectly good word, albeit a rare and archaic one.)

Torrenting media, even MP3s, is enough of a pain that people will pay for a good user experience (a/v quality, reliability, on-demand, etc., everything torrents lack).  Sometimes people will even buy high quality versions of stuff they've torrented and really liked.  Companies that take advantage of that opportunity are rolling in it.<p>3.  The content industry has fought every delivery innovation ever - radio, TV, VCR, and now even the Internet.

They wouldn't have restriction like this (yet, it will surely follow as the US puts a lot of pressure on Canada in these subjects). This would make the Canadian site a lot more attractive to both American and international customers. Paypal would suffer greatly.<p>A sorta reverse effect similar to this happened to Google in China. By standing up to the Chinese government Google had a disadvantage compared to the Chinese search engines and has be greatly affected by this over there.<p>The definition of foreign sites is also problematic. At this time the US government thinks it can seize any domain for which the top level domain administrator is in the US. Thus any site with a .ca, .is, .uk etc could be blocked by a weird definition of foreign. What I find funny is the use of the pirate bay as poster child of evil site. It's a .org domain it could be seize today. Wikileaks also a .org could have been seize by ICE (<a href=""http://www.ice.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ice.gov/</a>).

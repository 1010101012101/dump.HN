How many 5G chipsets do you need when 95% of the phone market is held by two manufacturers?  Hardware is expensive to develop and takes time.

Because everything is recorded these days, you don&#x27;t know if in the future you might want to hide something you did today. Say, you like to drink hibiscus tea and wear blue shoes. But it turns out in the future members of some horrible terrorist group will be drinking hibiscus tea and wearing blue shoes. Then you&#x27;d be a target all of the sudden.<p>EDIT: This similar to how police always can search your car if they want to -- they call the K-9 unit. The handler says &quot;find boy&quot; or does some other trained jesture or word, dog signals, now there is a probable cause to search your vehicle. It is very hard to prove that the dog was conditioned to signal on command and hard to refute (cop&#x27;s word vs yours). So that is why K-9 units are very popular with some police departments. They provide ambiguity and plausable pretext for searches.",1451354315

You just don&#x27;t hear about it as often as you hear about the more engineering-focused FOSS projects, for the same reasons you don&#x27;t hear about the research projects big companies do as much as their flagship engineering projects. (How many people have heard of Midori compared to Windows? I&#x27;d wager it&#x27;s the same ratio, speaking in orders of magnitude, as the number of people who have heard of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler vs. GCC, both of which are FOSS. I could name many other examples just in the PL domain.)<p>Now you might say that a lot of those open source research projects are funded by big companies, so they don&#x27;t count. But most development on popular open source projects is funded by big or medium-size companies. Research isn&#x27;t any different in this regard.<p>I think it&#x27;s no accident that most of your examples are hardware, not software. The problem there is that open source hardware is difficult to make work, not that open source research is difficult to make work. The other main example you gave is Unix, but FOSS didn&#x27;t exist in 1973--of course it wasn&#x27;t open source by the modern definition. Its research successor, Plan 9, <i>was</i> open source.<p>Disclaimer: I work on one of those open source research projects.",1451353320

In the absence of an interpreter, Clojure should also work if you do not rely on `eval` or any other functions which depend on the byte-code compiler at runtime.<p>This of course assumes their compilation model is compliant with whatever version of the JVM specification the Clojure compiler targets.

10804627,comment,10804497,10804497,0,0,bobby_9x,,,"&quot;Before becoming a mother, Scott had no problem finding work. She’d prepared food for the elderly and stocked shelves and sold magazines over the phone. She’d collected debts and made fast-food burgers and, most recently, answered calls from Verizon customers. She had a small apartment, rented for $495 per month, where black mold spread across the walls. But she was self-sufficient. She could afford food. “I was maybe one notch above poverty,” Scott said.<p>Having a child pushed her well below the poverty line&quot;<p>So she knew she was pretty much at the poverty line and decided to have a child anyway, further making it more difficult to live a normal life.   This was a poor choice, which led her to her current situation.<p>&quot;The call center wanted Scott to take night shifts, and Za’Niyah was eligible only for subsidized daytime child care. Scott quit and tried to find something else, somewhere else.&quot;<p>It sounds like she can&#x27;t even take care of herself, let alone a child.  The best idea in her case might just be to give her child to the state.<p>&quot;They tended to live in the middle of Atlanta, near the subway, and they also received welfare, cash payments from the government that were available to nearly all in deep poverty, regardless of whether they had a job.&quot;<p>&quot;a change that stems from the belief that entitlement programs failed to incentivize work and trapped people in poverty.&quot;<p>It does trap people in poverty.  All of my extended family have been living in abject poverty for 2+ generations.  Why?  The state paid them enough to live and they never had a desire or a want for anything beyond this.<p>The issue is that money doesn&#x27;t solve the problem.  You can throw as much money as you want at it, with little or no results.  Detroit is a good example of this having the opposite of the desired effect.  Money was thrown at the school systems for 30+ years and it&#x27;s now a shell of a city with probably the worst school systems in the country.<p>“They want you to get a job, which is not all bad,” Scott said. “But the way they go about it is horrible.”<p>The issue is that if you leave people up to their own devises, they will not look for work and continue to live in the homeless shelter forever.

Overall I think it&#x27;s good, but it misses some nuances.<p>First off, there&#x27;s a small contradiction about offline storage. The author says that users prefer web apps because they take up little-to-no space, but that the web needs to catch up in terms of storage capability. You can&#x27;t have it both ways - if websites become more offline-heavy, then users will need to get accustomed to managing their available space (as they already do with native apps). This is an as-yet unsolved UX problem for the web.<p>Also, based on the comments in this thread, I think many people don&#x27;t realize how far the web has come in terms of offline storage. Today you can build a mobile site that stores MBs of data, launches from the home screen, and works even in airplane mode. (On Android anyway. iOS is another story.)<p>I built a small site to demonstrate: <a href=""http://www.pocketjavascript.com/blog/2015/11/23/introducing-pokedex-org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pocketjavascript.com/blog/2015/11/23/introducing-...</a>. On an Android phone, Pokedex.org is basically indistinguishable from a native app, at least once you add it to the home screen. In Chrome, tap the green lock and you can see exactly how much space it takes up (around 6MB). Feel free to put your phone in airplane mode and refresh the page - it will still work.<p>Second off, there&#x27;s a lot of speculation in the post about Apple&#x27;s motives, and why they might be throttling back on the web platform relative to Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft. I&#x27;m guilty of this myself in &quot;Safari is the new IE,&quot; but nowadays I try to have a more nuanced take.<p>AFAICT, Apple seems to have many small teams with many different motivations, as does Google. Within Google, you&#x27;ll even find teams that actively undermine other teams - e.g. what the Chrome team is doing with Progressive Web Apps is a direct threat to Android apps. (I&#x27;m even surprised to see one team occasionally trash-talking the other on Twitter.) So talking about &quot;Google&#x27;s motives&quot; or &quot;Apple&#x27;s motives&quot; as if they&#x27;re each one big monolithic entity is a little simplistic.<p>My favorite theory about Apple and the web comes from this article (<a href=""http://blog.html5test.com/2015/07/safari-and-ie/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.html5test.com/2015/07/safari-and-ie/</a>), which argues that the WebKit team is just too small since the Blink split, which is why they&#x27;ve been having trouble keeping up. No grand conspiracy theory required - just that the team is a little under-financed. Also, Safari is still rocking it in terms of performance and battery life, so it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re asleep at the wheel.<p>I think the web still has a chance to catch up with native (for a lot of use cases anyway, not all of them), but it will require a change in how we build websites. In the same way that XMLHttpRequest was around for years before web devs &quot;discovered&quot; Ajax, I think offline storage and various mobile APIs might lay dormant for awhile before suddenly everybody is taking advantage of them. As web developers, the ball is in our court.",1451351823

This is similar to the lowercase English &#x27;a&#x27; or &#x27;u&#x27; written bottom to top - especially if using cursive.<p>or see: お<p>the last &#x27;dash&#x27; in the top right is a retouching of the paper after the curl on the bottom right.  Imagine a swirl that starts in top middle, swings around on the bottom left, swings around on the bottom right, lifts off the paper, and then touches back down briefly in the top right.  If you&#x27;re hand-writing, that little landing dot can be huge, tiny, or even conjoined, but to be legible it&#x27;s generally visually a continuation of the lower stroke.  If you just copied the letter without any concept of stroke, it would be difficult to read because you&#x27;d be looking for that swirl.  Imagine the dot on a lowercase &#x27;i&#x27; - it&#x27;s supposed to be directly above the stroke for your brain to render it as an &#x27;i&#x27; vs an &#x27;l&#x27;. It&#x27;s why when written out you can distinguish &#x27;il&#x27; and lt&#x27; even though they&#x27;re quite similar if drawn literally, quickly.<p>An example of stroke order vs stroke direction is more apparent when you need good proportions.  Kanji like 風 or 看 are really hard to &#x27;draw&#x27; with good square proportions if you don&#x27;t stroke them in a particular order. Kind of like trying to draw a face by starting with the nostrils, then doing the eyebrows, and ending with the outline of the face - it&#x27;s tough.<p>Interestingly, the Japanese hiragana letters are really designed to be written with a brush from top to bottom.  The letters flow from one to the next really nicely when written from top to bottom, and are actually much harder to write properly when written left to right.  See: す - き - の.  They&#x27;re much more natural to write top to bottom, and keep going down rather than from a left to right (which is also indicated by stroke order - the horizontal bars on the letters above are written before the downstrokes).",1451351747

Of course, I&#x27;m being overly general here, but men and women simply value different things. My wife looks for shampoo and carefully evaluates the scent, the brand, and any special additives that might make her hair more silky/shiny/etc. She&#x27;s willing to pay a premium for the right combination of features she desires. I look for the cheapest price and could care less what the shampoo claims to do. Same thing with salons. My wife wants to be pampered, have a wonderful experience, and values working with the same stylist on a long-term basis. I don&#x27;t mind being pampered, but if it costs me more than $30, I&#x27;d rather go watch ESPN while some new cosmetology grad cuts my hair for $19.

It could refer to the symmetric key (DEK) for disk encryption, and if so Microsoft already escrows that and Apple used to offer to do it. Does it refer to either the private key from these companies used for establishing TLS connections to their services? Or the private key generated on device for services using end to end encryption? I&#x27;d say the device private key is a huge freaking deal but still plausible they&#x27;d want that and get it upon request, more plausible than Apple, Google, whoever, saying no to China.

However, transitioning is hard and it takes time.. time which we unfortunately don&#x27;t have. That is the reason India demanded the developed nations to acknowledge it&#x27;s role in contributing to the problems of climate change and help the developing countries counter it via aid (100 billion USD per year) that will be used for R&D and building the necessary infrastructure to move away from coal as a primary source for energy production. Quoting the COP21 Agreement Section III, 54: &quot;Agreement shall set a new collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per\nyear, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries&quot; (Read more about it here: \n<a href=""http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/06/how-can-world-secure-100-billion-climate-finance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wri.org/blog/2015/06/how-can-world-secure-100-bil...</a>)<p>The Indian Prime Minister made it clear in COP21 summit that India is looking towards moving away from fossil fuels to clean energy.

By 2030, we will reduce emissions by 33 to 35% per cent of 2005 levels, and 40 per cent of our installed capacity will be from our non- fossil fuels.<p>We will achieve it by expanding renewable energy – for, example, by adding 175 Gigawatts of renewable generation by 2022. We will enlarge our forest cover to absorb at least 2.5 billion tonnes worth of carbon dioxide.<p>We are reducing dependence on fossil fuel through levies and reduction in subsidies; switching sources of fuel where possible; and, transforming cities and public transportation.&quot;",1451351027

The seawall was also supposed to be raised. It was an ancient 50 year old plant that got hit by not just one of the largest earthquakes Japan has ever seen, but also a massive, catastrophic tsunami. The fact that it took all those factors to knock the plant out gives me great confidence in nuclear power. Newer plants would not be susceptible to those kinds of issues. Short of a meteor crashing down on one (or an actual act of God), newer plants are completely safe. Safer, in fact, than any other.",1451350967

2872151,comment,2871379,2871786,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"Empirically, the case of Japan contradicts your claim that there isn't a whole lot of room to move. To remind you, Japan has long at close to and above a 200% debt-to-GDP ratio without any financing difficulty in sight.<p>The underlying reason for that is plain and simple: both the Japanese and the US governments are currency issuers. By definition, they are able to spend as much money in their respective currencies as they like. In that sense, they always have an infinite amount of room to move.<p>The only question can therefore be: How much of this maneuvering room <i>should</i> be used?<p>The answer to that question does not lie in financial data alone, but must take into account the state of the economy at large and whether additional spending might hit an inflation barrier. In the current situation, spending directed towards job-creation is unlikely to hit such a barrier, while handing out more money to the rich could drive speculation on resource markets (the money will be ""invested"" somewhere, after all) that can cause price increases and thus inflation.",1313056480

Why tax at all? Why not send >us< money?</i><p>The government is definitely capable of doing that, but think about the consequences. If the government were to spend without any limits at all, it would push aggregate demand to the point where the economy cannot grow quickly enough to satisfy the demand. The result will be inflation.<p>So taxation is necessary to take spending power away from private citizens and enterprises, to open up supply capacities that the government can then buy with its own spending, to fulfill whatever mandates are given to it, hopefully via a democratic process.<p>This is the obvious part. The more interesting question is: <i>How much</i> taxation is needed?<p>The answer to that is more subtle, but the key observation is that when private citizens and enterprises voluntarily refrain from using all their spending power, e.g. by paying down debt, saving, or simply hoarding cash (all of these things are happening these days), then obviously the amount of money removed from the private sector via taxation should be less than the amount of money that the government gives to the private sector via spending.<p>In fact, MMT economists argue that in the current situation, the budget deficit actually needs to become larger if the unemployment problem is to be resolved.<p>Finally, MMT tells you that the cases of the Italian and Greek governments are fundamentally different from the case of the US federal government.<p>It is clear that the US federal government will always be <i>capable</i> of paying back its debt, because it is the currency issuer of the US$, and its debts are only denominated in US$ (so the fact that almost a third of the debts are held by foreign owners is irrelevant). The only possibility is that the government might become <i>unwilling</i> to pay back its debt, but since congress is full of rich people who own a lot of government bonds, that scenario is quite unlikely.<p>This is <i>very</i> different from Italy and Greece, both of which do not have their own currency. Their governments are currency users like you and me, and they can become incapable of paying back their debt.",1313056004

Back then you didn't have Rails, Django, ORM, unit testing (in web dev that is), and javascript was looked as a language to just show popups and have confirm()'s before submitting forms.<p>If you wanted to connect to a MySQL, you have to do it all by yourself, you need to create a database, tables, PKs, connect to database, execute RAW mysql queries, and so on. Form validation ? Yeah right. Back then the include_once() or require() were amazing for separating code.\nBut all in all that mades us learn how things work internally, how HTTP requests work, how SQL works, even why CSRF or XSS and SQL injections are executed.<p>Yes, the code was shitty, it was all over the place, but we learned how a web app works internally.<p>And yet, most developers I know who coded PHP back then are amazing developers today in any web language or framework. Why ?<p>Because most of them learned doing things the hard way. We had to understand how HTTP requests works, how SQL works, etc..etc.. because we didn't have the magic of rails, or any helper for any framework.<p>In these 12 years, web development as grown, a lot, and for the better, I'm currently learning Rails, and I've already done a project with Django and Node.JS . I liked them a lot and they are amazingly well done, I just wished PHP was more OO like ruby or python.<p>However, I laugh at these new Rail/Django developers that joke about PHP code. Most of them start coding jumping immediately into a framework. I bet that most of then couldn't create a simple MVC framework, ORM from scratch, hell, even a simple security CSRF would be a pain without ""gem install <whatever>"".<p>You see kids, PHP was like our first GF or our first car, where we tried stuff, made us cry (in a sense), and helped us grow and mature as developers, for those who wanted to grow that is. Now you have lots of languages for web dev, but back then PHP was the thing.<p>I still believe that PHP is a very cool language if done correctly, I wished tho, that it should be rewritten to be more OO.<p>But if one thing I learned from all of these years is that, it's the developer who makes quality code, not the language. Unless that is, you are using a framework who basically demands you to do things the way it wants, and puts a lot for magic so you don't bother with ""boring"" stuff. But in the end of the day it's not your code, it's theirs.<p>So my advice for new dev is, forget frameworks, and learn the hardcore way, then pickup a framework you love and go with it, either PHP, Ruby, Python or whatever.",1313054940

Most very young companies still have terrible development practices, which makes it hard to quickly plug in a new technical hire.<p>I think there are three possible ways it might work.<p>1) You're willing to act as an executive assistant, doing whatever crap work comes up (market research, building slide decks, arranging meetings, filtering email, buying lunch) in return for exposure<p>2) They see you as a strong potential future hire and are thus willing to invest in training you up for 1-2 months as a sort of extended job interview.<p>3) They have a non-critical, self-contained side project you can come in and completely own. Examples include wireframing/designing a new site or feature, beginning a real content marketing strategy, understanding & documenting existing code & processes, etc.<p>#2 is the best for you, since you'll get ""real"" work. #3 is good, but I've seen teams give something which is a little bit too optional and then never integrate the final result, making it a worthless portfolio piece. #1 is the most boring and you'll probably have to switch companies after the stint to be considered a ""real"" team member, but it's probably the easiest to get into and would be a chance to trial the startup experience in general.",1313054060

The language used for teaching was F#, which is heavily inspired by OCaml. At one point we were given readings on OCaml programs and a particular operator popped up -- something like ""is subtype of"", I fail to recall exactly -- and it looked like :>? or :?> or similar.<p>I bitched loudly in the unit forum about this operator, whereupon the professor politely informed me that he, in fact, had invented that little bit of syntax when he was a PhD student at INRIA.<p>He didn't flunk me!

2872064,comment,2871501,2871927,5,0,jbri,,,"That would be neat. But it's essentially impossible with a traditional LCD screen - the physics don't work that way.<p>The way a backlit LCD works is that the backlight produces light, which goes straight into a polarizer. That polarizer absorbs 50% of the light energy - if it absorbed any less, then the light wouldn't be polarized. Then the light passes through the liquid crystal element to another polarizer, which either passes the light through or blocks it completely.<p>If you assume that half the screen is lit at any given time, it's physically impossible to not absorb 75% of the light in the polarizer. There are really only two ways to improve this, one is to produce polarized light directly, and the other is to return the lost energy to the device some other way (as this does).",1313053282

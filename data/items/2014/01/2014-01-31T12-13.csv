7156424,comment,7153709,7155706,8,0,tptacek,,,"Patrick&#x27;s description isn&#x27;t &quot;good on paper&quot;; it is a spookily accurate reflection of reality thorough enough that I, the Cliff Clavin of Hacker News, was unable to come up with a single thing to add to it, despite the fact that he is explaining <i>my business model</i> (I co-founded, co-managed, and co-scaled the consultancy I co-operate today).<p>The basic exchange between consulting management and labor is one of risk for upside. The returns from a consulting business can get very lumpy. An employee&#x27;s income cannot be. They&#x27;re promised a salary, presumably at market rate (else why take the job), and everything else is the company&#x27;s problem. Hit a dry spell, employees keep getting paid, and principals don&#x27;t.<p>At a well-run consultancy in a hot market (say, software security), there&#x27;s not much incentive to squeeze employees, because recruiting and retention are expensive and because when you lose a consulting employee, it&#x27;s often to companies that happen to be fierce competitors. So for instance, if you were instrumental to a deal here, you&#x27;d be eligible for the same kind of bonus compensation that the sales guy who closed the deal would be eligible for.<p>There&#x27;s room in every business model for unscrupulous managers to somehow cheat employees. But if this million dollar contract you talk about was so clearly the product of your ability and execution, why did you need to be employed by design agency to deliver it? Why did you settle for the promise of a &quot;bonus&quot;? Or is it that, if not for you, some other consultancy would have won the deal, and also not given any of their employees a million dollars as a result?<p>We&#x27;ve lost team members who moved on to start their own firms. Chris Rohlf, now of LeafSR, was one of our all-time best consultants (and is one of the all-time great vulnerability researchers). With a few years experience running his own shop successfully, and dealing with all that entailed, I know what he&#x27;d tell you about whether he had a square deal at Matasano.<p>Not for nothing, but: if you&#x27;re at a point in your career where you feel like you&#x27;re make-or-break for million dollar deals that you yourself could close, maybe you shouldn&#x27;t be working for a consultancy, and instead be running one.",1391173163

Microsoft needs someone who will fix their ridiculous enterprise agreement / contract / sales process and win back the hearts and minds of CIOs around the world.  In my personal opinion, this has to be job #1... at least for the Finance+Sales organization.<p>They also need credibility with consumers and techies on their R&D and hardware/platforms side.  Not that they don&#x27;t have decent stuff now, but they have approached it like a large enterprise rather than as a hip tech company and it&#x27;s really unsexy for people to proclaim their love of Azure vs [insert ANY other PAAS/IAAS here].  Just as an example....  Windows Phone and the whole Windows OS strategy is something else they should publicize better.  At this point, hardly anyone is building Metro mobile apps because it&#x27;s really unclear WTF Microsoft is doing beyond Windows 8.1, and what will happen to Nokia or their very few other hardware partners if sales don&#x27;t take off.  The Surface Pro is a really nice tab and fits well into a lot of IT strategies, given it hits both the &quot;I want a sexy tablet!&quot; and the &quot;I need my freaking Excel and my goddamn PowerPoint animations!&quot; sweet spots.  MS has a ton of potential and loads of talent.

7156399,comment,7155864,7155891,2,0,tzs,,,"(In what follows, I&#x27;ll be making some generalizations or slight simplifications. There may be exceptions here and there to some things I say, but it should be good enough to explain how precedent works).<p>There are three levels of federal courts. At the bottom level, there are the district courts. These are what most people think of when they think &quot;court&quot;. These courts hold trials to determine what the facts are, and they apply the law to those facts. This generally also involves interpreting the meaning of the law. The district courts are were jury trials are held (although the parties can agree to have a judge determine the facts instead of a jury).<p>Next level up are the appellate courts. If a party does not like the outcome of a district court trial or of a decision a district judge makes, they can appeal to an appellate court. The appellate court does not concern itself with determining the facts of the case--it accepts the findings of the district court there [1]. The appellate court concerns itself with whether or not the district court correctly determined what law applies to the case, correctly interpreted that law, correctly applied it, did not allow evidence that should have been excluded, did not exclude evidence that should have been allowed, and things like that.<p>Finally, at the top level, we have the Supreme Court. They handle appeals from parties dissatisfied with appellate court rulings. Generally, the Supreme Court gets to decide whether or not it will hear an appeal. It generally only takes cases where there is some important point of law to be settled, or where different appellate courts have been reaching contradictory conclusions and a nationwide standard needs to be imposed.<p>There is a single Supreme Court.<p>There are 12 general appellate courts (and there are some specialized appellate courts that only deal with specific legal areas, and are not relevant for this discussion), each handling a particular geographical area. These are called Circuits. The full name of these courts are &quot;U.S. Court of Appeals for the (whatever) Circuit&quot;. These courts each have many judges (for instance, the 9th Circuit, which covers the Western US, has 29 judges), with courtrooms at many places in the Circuit. When the Court of Appeals hears an appeal, it will be handled by a panel of judges, generally three. For more important cases, they will have larger panels.<p>There are around 700 federal district courts.<p>Precedent goes downward, along the same lines that appeals go up on. The Supreme Court sets binding precedent for all of the Courts of Appeal and for all of the district courts. The Court of Appeals for a given circuit sets binding precedent for the district courts in its geographical region. District courts do not set binding precedent.<p>Note I said &quot;binding&quot; precedent. That is precedent that must be followed. There is also non-binding precedent (also called persuasive precedent, and a few other names). For instance, if a federal appeals court in New York makes a ruling on some legal question that no other circuit has dealt with, and then later a district court in California deals with that same question, the California court does not have to follow the New York court, even though the New York court is at a higher level, because the New York court is in a different circuit--the New York decision is not <i>binding</i> precedent. The California court will, however, look to the New York court&#x27;s opinion for guidance.<p>In this particular case, the ruling was by a district court, so pretty much means nothing as far as precedent goes. That particular district court will probably rule the same way on future cases it sees that have substantially the same fact pattern, and other district courts in the same circuit will look at its reasoning and take it as non-binding precedent, but won&#x27;t be bound to follow it.<p>[1] This is not quite correct. I think they can overrule the jury on a matter of fact if they determine that no reasonable jury could have reached that conclusion.",1391172641

Everything you buy has an energy footprint, and for many things it&#x27;s one that we outsource to China.

Guilt is good -- it prevents you doing the same bad things again and gives you a perspective of what you did.<p>People might not live in the past, but countries carry their past with them.<p>The fact that the actual people that started the Vietnam war have died, doesn&#x27;t mean that the country and the organisations that they worked in died with them. Those should carry the guilt forward. (Of course, instead they usually carry forward the same long term strategic planning that led to their previous attrocities).<p>What I mean is, countries are not discreet: they are continuous. A country has a history like a person has. Its history doesn&#x27;t die and start from zero with each generation.<p>That&#x27;s even an accepted norm of international relation even when the change inside a country is from a state to another (e.g the US after independence) etc. It&#x27;s called &quot;succession of state&quot;)<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succession_of_states</a><p>Now, of course the truth is that they are not crippled by guilt at all -- they never stopped doing crimes on humanity and on their own citizens ever. Look what they are doing to the native americans in Dakota still. Look at Zimmerman.",1391170466

Even if it&#x27;s cheaper, it&#x27;s sort of defeating the purpose of &quot;i can scale on demand&quot;. (which, yes you can still do, but you&#x27;re back to &#x27;on demand&#x27; pricing).<p>As someone else pointed out, some of where AWS gets you is the storage and traffic.  I&#x27;ve got a setup right now where I need to have at peak 2-3 servers to handle traffic, as there&#x27;s a moderate amount of computation going on - it&#x27;s not all the time, nor every day, but when I need it, I need it.  And it&#x27;s processing documents (photos, etc) and we need to store them.  Then show them back to the user.  With on demand pricing, and the amount of traffic, this can be ~$600+ per month (*12 = ~$7000/year).<p>Could I optimize the code more to use less CPU, and perhaps require 1 less server?  Possibly.  Could I optimize some other stuff?  Possibly, but that will cost more time, in order to save money with AWS.<p>Reserved instances would probably be the best, but if we ended up needing more later, it&#x27;s harder to go back 6 months later and say &quot;hey, we need more $ for X&quot;, as the budget was already done and processed for project Y.<p>I&#x27;ve got some projects like this at digitalocean, and one on month-to-month dedicated hardware, and the pricing is about 50%, mostly because of the built-in storage that AWS line items separately.<p>Can AWS do more functionally?  Sure.  Do we need it?  Usually not, and paying for that infrastructure when it doesn&#x27;t match the core needs isn&#x27;t usually an option.  Elastic IPs would be nice, but we could get much of that utility at linode if need be, and still pay less.",1391169832

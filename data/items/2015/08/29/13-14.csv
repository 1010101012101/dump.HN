There were until the New Deal very few SCOTUS cases that even mentioned it, let alone turned on it. In the few cases in which appellants hoped to rely on a notion of &quot;unenumerated yet extant rights&quot;, SCOTUS rejected the interpretation.<p>History also doesn&#x27;t do much to support an argument that the  9th hides a right to &quot;privacy&quot;. The original drafts of the 9th Amendment weren&#x27;t about unenumerated rights, but about state and local rights versus the power of the federal government. The language was bickered over, but apparently much of the jurisprudence of the 9th that happened anywhere close to the time of the founders was about devolution of state and local power.<p>See for instance Hugo Black&#x27;s dissent in Griswold:<p><pre><code>    [The Ninth] Amendment was passed, not to\n    broaden the powers of this Court or any\n    other department of the [Federal\n    Government], but as every student of\n    history knows, to assure the people that\n    the Constitution . ..was intended to\n    limit the Federal Government to the\n    powers granted expressly or by necessary\n    implication.

When they were first introduced, many drivers were absolutely adamant that no computer could possibly have the nuance and feel to outbrake a human driver on difficult surfaces. Now, it seems utterly obvious an algorithm sensing wheel slip at 1000Hz has a better ability to maintain traction than a human driver with reaction times measured in the hundreds of milliseconds.<p>Self-driving cars won&#x27;t suddenly arrive on the market fully-formed. The technology will be introduced incrementally as a series of driver aids, to supplement the range of driver aids that are already standard (ABS, TC, ESC). We&#x27;re simply seeing the acceleration of a trend that has been happening for years - computers taking over control from the human driver.<p>Several manufacturers now offer collision avoidance systems that can automatically apply the brakes based on RADAR sensing.

Seriously.<p>Years ago, I picked up a &quot;Moshi&quot; voice controlled clock-radio from Brookstone. I needed a new clock-radio and I had a discount coupon. I figured I might use the voice commands to set the time, if it ran fast or slow, but that was about it. It was just a gimmick.<p>At first, that&#x27;s all it was, too. However, based on some comments here on HN, I decided to get rid of all extra light in my bedroom. The display has three settings, one of which is &quot;off.&quot; (While the &quot;dim&quot; setting is dimmer than the normal setting, it&#x27;s still brighter than my old clock radio&#x27;s blue display.) Now, I use the voice command to check the time. I don&#x27;t need to turn my head, turn over, or even open my eyes.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect.

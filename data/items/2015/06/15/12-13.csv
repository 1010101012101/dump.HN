Or are there just no accountants on board?<p>Regardless of the legality, responsibility should ultimately fall on the shoulders of the investor to require financial reporting be done in a way that is acceptable to that investor, before they hand over money to the company. This may not be as true in publicly traded companies, where many amateur investors are participating in the market. The same goes for angel investing, if only because many companies at that stage may be pre-revenue or even pre-product. However, at the VC level, millions of dollars are invested to scale supposedly sound businesses. VCs should be sophisticated enough to manage this risk, and if I were an LP looking to put my money in a VC fund, I would be very concerned about putting my money in a fund that didn&#x27;t have some sort of required standard financial reporting practices for all portfolio companies.",1434373024

Cloud applications largely require two-way sending and receiving of data, so if we are to see more businesses being able to run interactive applications on the Cloud, more local POPs are required which carry the full application stack. For example, while your Google Photos viewing may be cached, for someone to upload the photos – you still have to upload them to a datacenter in Europe. In David Weekly’s tests – Google and Apple content is actually served off a local edge cache in Nairobi, however that does not serve DNS traffic for example from Google’s famous 8.8.8.8 IP address which is interactive (send-receive). Another tricky problem is if people use 8.8.8.8 – a CDN provider such as Akamai will see your request as coming from Europe, and will serve the request out of a European datacenter as opposed to the node in Nairobi.</i><p>CloudFlare will be rolling out edge hardware in Africa this year to address the latency problem. We will also be rolling out DNS in Africa as well so that DNS queries will not need to leave the continent (or even country in many cases).<p>For dynamic content we will be supporting our Railgun technology to help alleviate the backhaul latency from these edge machines to origin servers.<p>These problems are solvable and Africa has not been forgotten (at least by us).

Larger entities get /48&#x27;s (128-48=>80 bits of address space). So everyone (you, your device, your network) has plenty of addresses to spare.<p>Addresses are written in hex, in the form 0011:2233:4455:6677:8899:aabb:ccdd:eeff (that&#x27;s 8 groups of 16 bits -> 128 bits). If there are zeroes in an address on, you can omit them (ie. 1122:3344:5566:0000:0000:0000:0000:1234 => 1122:3344:5566::1234).<p>Some protocols (ARP, kinda DHCP, ICMP) are merged into a single procotol called NDP (neighbor discovery protocol).<p>When you&#x27;re a home user, your router/gateway/CPE would get a /64 from your ISP, for example 2001:1234:4567:89ab::0/64. to use for your local devices. For example, in your LAN, your router would probably be 2001:1234:4567:89ab::1, while your devices would probably be addressed between 2001:1234:4567:89ab::2 and 2001:1234:4567:89ab:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff.<p>If your router is not using DHCPv6, but instead only NDP, it would simply respond with a “we&#x27;re using 2001:1234:4567:89ab::0/64 here, I&#x27;m your gateway” to every device coming into the LAN, and the device would choose an address based on it&#x27;s NIC MAC and some other facts. If your router would be using DHCPv6, the exchange would be just like in ordinary DHCP (dhcp request -> dhcp reply with IPv6 address to use).<p>There is some extra (standarized) link-local magic with IPv6 - if you seen an fe80::0/16 address on your link, then it means that there was no IPv6 router/DHCP server on there and the devices in the LAN are establishing connection independently - but of course, without any access to the rest of the IPv6 Internet. This is also done via NDP, IIRC.<p>And that&#x27;s basically it. No NAT. The devices in your LAN are directly routable to devices in your friend&#x27;s LAN, or to Facebook&#x27;s server",1434371878

9718903,comment,9717686,9718619,0,0,stsp,,,"> The only thing it won&#x27;t do out of the box is automatically connect to previously used wifi networks. I suspect none of the OpenBSD developers want that.<p>That&#x27;s not true. OpenBSD developers want this. There are several ideas floating around about making the kernel cache wifi passwords, scan and re-connect automatically when it lost link to the AP. This topic keeps coming up during hackathons.<p>For various reasons it&#x27;s not as easy to do as one might expect.<p>The net80211 layer and wifi device drivers don&#x27;t keep track of link state to the AP at present. This would need to be implemented first. It is essentially client-side roaming support.\nOne way of doing this is to count missed beacons and assume the AP is out of range if no beacons have been seen for a while. Some devices provide such counters in hardware, some don&#x27;t.\nThe biggest part of the challenge is to make this work seamlessly with _every_ driver.<p>Then there&#x27;s a risk of feature bloat. Add too much automation and you end up with something opaque like network manager which just pisses many people off. Add too little automation and you don&#x27;t cover many use cases. And networking is not just about wifi, it&#x27;s at least about ethernet and VPN as well. Some tools already exist to handle aspects of this (e.g. ifstated(8), trunk(4), interface priorities managed with ifconfig(8), a ton of ipsec tooling), and should be properly integrated in the design.<p>Another question is how to integrate with desktop wireless tools that come from Linux (e.g. wifi network pop-up menus for KDE4 and Gnome3) which usually require a backend using Linux-specific ioctls or dbus/NetworkManager/systemd APIs to function. But seamless integration with desktops would be outright awesome and make the system much easier to use for non-technical users.<p>There&#x27;s probably a couple of gsoc projects worth of work in this.

What that means is, you can then intersect the minhash bitfields as many times over as you like, and extract a predictably accurate similarity index in linear time with definable confidence bounds.",1434370896

When a clarinetist is playing an open G, no keys are depressed, and so the instrument is supported only by the mouth and the right thumb.<p>The reason the left thumb has so few (saxophone and flute each have one, clarinet has two, oboes have one or two, bassoon is an anomaly) is because it usually operates the register key, which has to be held down much of the time while the other fingers do most of the work (not unlike a shift key for typing capitals). Having the left thumb do this is much easier than, say, the pinky, since you lose a lot of dexterity in your ring finger if the pinky has to stay depressed.<p>Some less common instruments do have more thumb keys; high-end bass clarinets have an extended low register and the two additional notes are operated by the right thumb. Bass clarinet typically uses a peg or a neckstrap, so the thumb is freed up a little bit to do some work.<p>(For a moment I forgot the main topic of the thread was computer keyboards and thought you had very strange piano technique!)",1434370456

9718784,comment,9716897,9718091,0,0,heavenlyhash,,,"Having recently started working on a chat client that was intended to speak first-and-foremost XMPP, I have to agree: XMPP is... it&#x27;s decades out of date and missing a number of absolutely critical, central ideas that are essential to making stuff <i>work</i>.<p>Examples:<p>- unique message IDs?  Absent.  XEPs kind of provide; but I can&#x27;t tell you which of the three or for relevant ones are the <i>most</i> relevant (AMP IDs from XEP 0079? Stream Management from XEP 0198?  Acking from XEP 0184?  Something from Carbons or MAM in 0313 or 0280?  You know, if you wanted some light reading...).<p>- multi device?  Oh.  My.  God.  It&#x27;s bananas.  The spec behavior is that whenever a client sends a message, the server is supposed to consider that one the most alive, and then route all future messages <i></i><i>exclusively</i><i></i> to that one.  So you send a message on your phone?  Yeah, your desktop is just going to <i>silently stop receiving messages</i>.<p>- there&#x27;s a concept of &quot;message carbons&quot; to deal with this.  This involves re-sending all your messages back to the server after you receive them, with special instructions to send them back again to your other clients.  The amount of redundantly redundant XML involved is eyewatering.<p>Combine that multidevice behavior (messages can get randomly routed anywhere at any time) with the wild-west nature of message delivery acks, and you can see how ridiculously difficult this makes the basic idea of &quot;all clients should see the same picture&quot;.<p>Overall, the XEP process, conceptually, is a great example of open extensibility.  The trouble is, so much of this stuff is <i>core</i> to sane message delivery semantics that it really, practically speaking, causes huge problems when it&#x27;s all considered &quot;extensions&quot;.  Stuff like message IDs fundamentally shouldn&#x27;t be an extension because it&#x27;s just too critical that all minimum-viable clients agree.  You just can&#x27;t build higher level stuff without that.  XEPs are great.  A community process for extensions should exist.  It just needs to exist for extensions, not subsume the total set of realistic minimum viable features.<p>I want an open chat protocol.<p>I thought XMPP might be the one.  Then, as the parent comment jibes, I actually looked at it.  Tried to write something with it.<p>XMPP is not prepared to be the one, in any sense at all except for legacy support.  I have all the respect in the world for all the folks who put effort into trying to make an open chat standard, but... honestly, we need a stronger foundation than this.",1434369822

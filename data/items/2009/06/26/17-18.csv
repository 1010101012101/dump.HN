For e.g. I am interested only in tweets about Ruby from the Ruby people. Put this way, the solution is to simply filter on words related to ruby. But this is not powerful enough for the user to be able to say I am interested in any tweets about technology from the Ruby people. Now your dictionary will run into hundreds/thousands of words per group.<p>We are building a solution to this problem. In fact we don't have any twitter api code yet since we are focusing on the core logic first. This would be really useful to us.<p>Edit: plus we use django as well!<p>Re-edit: Your ranking algorithm for tweets is pretty cool. You asked why we should get the project. Here are the specific reasons:<p>1) We are building something useful that adds to your solution, something that (we believe) people want.<p>2) I have a strong background in text analysis and classification - it has been my bread and butter for almost 4 years now.

9452,comment,9241,9241,0,0,danielha,,,"Wow, comprehensive. Good post -- commenting so I can easily find this later. <p>I've been making personal notes on design principles I observe while viewing or using sites. I made note of what works, how good things could be improved, and most importantly, what should absolutely be avoided. It wasn't as organized as this, but I'll put mine online if I ever get around to tidying it up.",1175816759

Great article.<p>I'm so glad he mentioned this - my eyes glaze over every time I hear stats like ""yeah, we're awesome, we're in a X billion dollar market"":<p>""[Don't] claim that you're in a multi-billion dollar market. Isn't every company in a multi-billion market according to some study? At least every company that's ever pitched a venture capitalist.""",1175815899

9449,comment,9348,9348,0,0,inklesspen,,,"I know I found (during my Summer of Code work last year) that I had to get out of the house to get any real work done. It's well-known advice to have a separate ""work"" area of the house if you want to succeed at working from home, and I'd have done that if I had a spare room.",1175815827
9448,comment,9369,9410,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"I would only personally take funding from YC or certain other angels I know, but I'm glad to see other options popping up. I'm pretty sure PG and Jessica are too. I imagine it would take some of the pressure off of them being the only game in town. <p>Also, the YC model isn't for everyone obviously. It's basic Econ101 - these seed-funders are striving to meet a market demand that is far from being even close to being met given all those who are not accepted. I imagine and hope that even more will spring up so more guys can get the leg-up they may need. <p>Not everyone can be a Stanford or Harvard - but that doesn't mean there aren't other very good schools that are a better fit for many students.",1175815331

9446,comment,9348,9348,0,0,danielha,,,"At such an early stage, I think an apartment works quite well. My cofounder and I share an apartment (with a couple other friends) and things get done. Integrate your startup with your life because the startup <i>is</i> your life if you're serious. But it really depends on you as a person. If it's just that you're somebody that needs to be supervised/forced in a specific environment to be productive, then you might reevaluate your ambitions in starting a company.",1175815007

9444,comment,8375,8584,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"He he, good find. <p>It's like when grown children think it's cute to talk baby-talk. Sure it's cute when babies do it, but after a certain age - it's just, well, embarrassing - and a bit nauseating. You know they know better, but they're so desperate to maintain the cuteness they had as a baby that they just can't move on and think of something original and clever. Just embarrassing. Poor guy - he must not be getting enough attention at home.",1175814609

9440,comment,9352,9352,0,0,mattjaynes,,,"Rick Segal's approach seems the most charitable. <p>It works similarly in dating. \n(Note that I date with the goal of marriage in mind - definitely not a player, which makes this a good analogy to the good VC's - they're hoping to 'marry' founders when it's a good match)<p>Many guys burn bridges when they have to break up with a girl. However, that's totally unnecessary! I've certainly done that when I was a teen, but have found the charitable approach much more effective. Let me be clear that 'charitable' does not mean unclear or deceptive in the breakup. On the contrary - it's being very clear and honest about the breakup with the girl. That being said, you <i>do</i> withhold any information that would unnecessarily hurt her (ex: you're not attracted to something about her that she can't help).<p>The breakup needs to establish that:<p>1) the relationship is not a match for you, but that that is no reflection on her personally in the slightest<p>2) you genuinely admire the N number of amazing things about her<p>3) you hope that you both can still be good friends, but that you understand and honor her wish if she thinks it's better not to<p>4) the romantic possibilities of your relationship are just not there sufficient for marriage and never will be (let her move on with closure!) Don't worry, if you change your mind later you can crawl back on your knees to her and tell her you were wrong - but you have to let her go and pursue other possibilities.<p>5) you are open to talk with her about it at any time - this will usually relieve a lot of her anxiety about having to wonder why you broke up later.<p>Note: Be careful about the 'still being friends' thing. If you are hanging out too much with her, most other guys will avoid asking her out - and you don't want to hinder her ability to move on. Be sure to honor her space and let her know that you are doing that so she doesn't feel rejected by it.<p>Success stories:<p>2004 girlfriend: Good breakup, she decided it was better for her to not have contact. I honored that and imagine she has gone on to great things.<p>2005 girlfriend: Good breakup, though we did get back together several times. Ultimately it ended, but our communication was so good that we have remained best friends since then and talk regularly about our new relationships. We both are huge advocates of each other - she sells me to other girls and I sell her to other guys. We do business together too since there is such a high level of trust.<p>2006 girlfriend: Had a great time together, but we both knew it wouldn't work. We had great communication and though it was hard for me to let her go, I did and that really impressed her to the point where we have a similar high-trust, high-advocate relationship as with 2005 girlfriend.<p>2007 girlfriend: Ended about a week ago. So far so good. Very hard for both of us. But we've had good communication since and it is evolving well into a good friend relationship.<p>Note that these tips assume that you are only dating reasonably sane girls - with psycho chics this probably won't apply ;)<p>It's important to remember that going the charitable route is often harder in the short-term than the alternatives, but it's important to suck it up and have the kahoonas to do it right. Some guys may be tempted to not give her a clean break or feel they have to diminish her as a person to satisfy their own insecurities. DON'T DO IT! Seriously, it will hammer your karma and make life much more difficult for you in the long-term. To illustrate: 2006 girlfriend only dated me because of the good things 2005 girlfriend told her about how good our relationship and breakup was. The same with 2007 girlfriend. It's really the way to go if you can be respectful and honor them, because more often than not, they will return the sentiment.<p>(sorry for the length - it started as a comment, but turned into a full post - hopefully a few will find some value in it ;)<p>Update: I decided to make this a full-on post at: <a href=""http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/"">http://blog.nanobeepers.com/2007/04/05/breaking-up-is-hard-to-do/</a>",1175814060

2514228,comment,2512837,2512837,3,0,thos3000,,,"My wife and I also moved to Portland from Austin, so I have a bit of insight on this. First, let me point out that while the job market in general in Portland is still a bit sluggish, the tech job market seems relatively lively. I don't know any experienced, talented software developers who have been out of work for long. I know a number of them who are freelancing successfully, even, so that's possible here, but I would suggest that before you have built up a local network, it's likely not the best idea. If you are planning to visit here, I would search out the user groups and various technical ""networking"" groups ahead of time and get in touch. Sign up for their mailing lists, plan to attend as many meetings as you can while you're here and ask direct questions about the ""scene.""<p>As for interviews and salaries... salaries, at least in the areas I've paid attention to, are generally slightly higher than Austin (offset marginally by a very slightly higher cost of living here) but lower, in general, than you'd find in the bay area. Interviews are across the board as they are anywhere. Your best bet to find out what to expect for interviews is to find someone who works for the company and try to befriend them or at least get their opinion. These same rules really apply anywhere, honestly, so I hope I'm not telling you anything new.<p>As someone else mentioned, there are a lot of media/SEO related companies here, but there are also some interesting startups and more established companies in other areas, as well. As with my suggestion above, the best way to find out about the different companies is to talk to people who work there. Users group and (the old fashioned variety of) social networking are really your best opportunity to find out more about them.<p>Also, as with Austin, I've found that the people who do best in this community are the ones who are not afraid to cross bridges (sorry, slight pun on one of Portland's nicknames). That is, explore communities that maybe aren't directly in your area of experience. Whether that's the data visualization group, beer and blog (which isn't really all that much about blogging), or some group for a language you just barely even understand, give it a try and see who you meet. Chances are you'll start to see some of the same people around town. Seek these people out and get to know them -- they will be your best resource. If you're really determined to do well, get involved in organizing and planning of different events and groups. Before you know it, jobs will be coming to you.",1304524772

It's just that simple to make something synchronous, as opposed to turning something synchronous asynchronous (by using a queue).<p>By doing this you are not limiting the queue to the size of 1. If you have N producers, you can have more than N elements in the queue, but the idea is that each producer can only enter them one by one, with the agreement of the consumer. Nothing would stop the consumer from accepting a thousand of them before waiting before replying, therefore slowing down the producer. The idea is just to limit the rate at which you accept queries by tying it to the speed of the consumer.<p>If this is not enough, you can look at things like the jobs tool (<a href=""https://github.com/esl/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/esl/jobs</a>) to work with scheduling.<p>By the way, you're mistaken on the idea of message sending always succeeding.

It's certainly part of it, but in large part it's intimately tied to the socialization context that surrounds the entire rock scene.<p>When a fan is going to a show, it's a special event. A large population of those fans use drugs in an effort to enhance their enjoyment. They also want to share that enjoyment with the band, and they are quite willing to share their supply with the band. In other words, the rock band basically has a free, unlimited supply of drugs and a social expectaton to take advantage of that.<p><i>> There's a reason why they all act so damn crazy after a certain point in their careers.</i><p>I'm sure you didn't mean that literally, but there are several rock stars who don't end up crazy.

The reality is that it's a small subset of rock stars that go crazy, and I would argue that the proportion is actually lower than for the average population of somewhat-heavy drug users.",1304522670

It's my life.  I can get excited about -coding- anything.  The actual product, though?  Not so much.<p>In fact, the company that recently hired me asked if I was interested in their product, and I honestly answered that I wasn't, but programming was my passion.  When he frowned a little (it was obviously the wrong answer), I told him that I wasn't interested in the product I was coming from, either, and I'd been there 5 years and loved it.  And it was true.<p>Avid programmers are the kind of people who took everything apart when they were kids.  How things work, and making them work, is much more interesting than what the result of that work is.<p>So I disagree with their assessment, if that's why they didn't hire you.  Your passion for programming should have been more than enough to cover a lack of passion for the product itself.<p>And I'll even take it a step further:  You could be an asset to the team.  You are the user that got away.  You used the product, and left.  You can tell them how to get you to stay as a user, and you've got the technical know-how to make it happen...

One of the things I love about it is that it <i>starts</i> with Maxwell's equations, in their non-simplified form, then goes into the special cases of electrostatics, magnetostatics, and then uniting them into electrodynamics. Feynman goes over the special cases in a way that you never forget that they're in the end incorrect simplifications, there's even a table at the end of the statics section showing ""These equations are false, these are true in general.""<p>I don't mind simplified incorrect models so long as they're presented that way (so I don't want to read a ""all that stuff we just covered? Yeah it's wrong""-ish sentence after the fact) and the full truth is eventually revealed in an understandable way. I want a full picture of something, not a partial incorrect picture of something, it scares me that some people never stop thinking of an atom as a small planetary system.",1304521301

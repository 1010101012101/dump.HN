8922331,comment,8921338,8921338,0,0,avivo,,,"Would one potential solution be to create a secondary optional gatekeeper?<p>The basic idea would be - don&#x27;t submit directly. First submit to the community gatekeepers, they will look over your work, and if they think it will meet approval, they&#x27;ll pass it on. Otherwise they can give helpful feedback. They can have strong standards about how contributors are treated.<p>This extra step can be optional - if you don&#x27;t mind rough treatment or are confident of approval you can skip it...<p>The result: less work for existing gatekeeper(s) without changing their process, more friendly and helpful interactions for contributors, and no slowdown if you really know what you are doing.<p>Of course the cost is that people need to volunteer to be that secondary gatekeeper! (and have some tough skin when interfacing with the primary gatekeeper)<p>==<p>In an ideal world everyone would have the skills and interest to efficiently be pleasant to everyone else while vetting infinite code. But in this world of finite time and not everyone having every skill it can make sense to have some more &quot;division of labor&quot;.<p>That said - I&#x27;m very curious if there are aspects of this that I&#x27;m missing that make this perspective insufficient.",1421834352

The NS era is just such a huge part of history lessons in school, militarism and just pure evil is by far the dominating notion of a German thinking about history. While glorifying their own shortcomings in the past, the English view on Germany [0] is much more differentiated, acknowledging the good parts like the Hanse [1] or thousand year old organizations like the Teutonic Knights [2] without just thinking about 20th century Germany&#x27;s imperialism.<p>Anecdotally Wagner, whose 200th birthday would have been 2 years ago, is casually mentioned in the article as being able to be interpreted liberally, while he is viewed much more critically in Germany [3]. Questions like whether or not one should enjoy art, whose creator was evil are not that uncommon.<p>I think recent events like the reunion or the comeback of German football starting with the world cup in 2006 changed peoples perception about Germany quite a bit.

If either interviewer had poor tendencies, they&#x27;ll be curtailed a bit because they know someone else is there to witness them.<p>If both interviewers are in agreement, that&#x27;s a pretty strong data point.<p>When it came time for &quot;review&quot; at the end of the day, we started with an around the room &quot;thumbs up/down&quot;. No hiding behind an anonymous email to the recruiter/manager. If it was unanimously up...offer. Unanimously down? Obvious no hire. If it was mixed, we&#x27;d go around to all of the thumbs down, and ask, &quot;Are you on the fence, or are you 100% vehemently opposed to this candidate?&quot; If they said, &quot;NO WAY JOSE&quot;, we&#x27;d ask them to give their reasoning. Then, we&#x27;d ask if anyone had a positive enough experience to argue in favor of the candidate. If not? No hire. If yes, we&#x27;d then go around the room and ask all of the interviewers to give a full description of the interview.

No process, is perfect, but I feel this was pretty fair.<p>Oh - lastly, if a candidate was particularly hard to decide on, and we went around the room, and some people were for them, and some were against, and it ended up in deadlock - we ended the meeting and it was up to the ranking members of the team to decide (i.e. managers.) This meant that after one round of debate, we wouldn&#x27;t keep wasting the company&#x27;s dime trying to force consensus, and instead moved the decision to the people who the company had already decided it wanted to make decisions.

8922275,comment,8916379,8919772,0,0,klibertp,,,"No, XSLT is perfectly capable of generating plain text, which means it can also generate JSON, YAML or what have you. It&#x27;s true that generating malformed XHTML would be rather hard, though.<p>As for fast: compared to any other templating engine for server side languages. It was very long ago when I tested this, but for rendering a simple blog page XSLT with lxml (so completely on the C side) was much faster than Jinja2. I suspect only things like Mustache would have a chance here, but then again: XSLT is Turing-complete (probably accidentally, but still).<p>And that&#x27;s before taking into account that you don&#x27;t have to do rendering server-side at all - you can just serve static files and rely on the browser to render them. I don&#x27;t know if it would be faster than serving static files and rendering with JS, but it has one advantage: it works even for people who have JS disabled.<p>There are many problems with XSLT, though. XSLT 1.0 is almost unworkable and XSLT 2.0, while specified, is nonexistent: nobody bothered to implement it. Once you start using implementation specific ways of extending it, you lose the benefit of being able to render on a client. Turing completeness can be a trap, too: you can code infinite loop in XSLT, and good luck debugging it (or even recognizing where do you loop in the first place...).<p>Still, XML and XSLT are a very nice technology, which should be used much more often. The problem, I suspect, is that XML is &quot;yuck&quot; nowadays, which means no one wants to use it, learn it or improve it.",1421832948

That is, if the entire planet had 0 transactions for the next 24 hours, you&#x27;d still award bitcoin miners the same block rewards every 10 minutes for the next 24 hours. In other words, block rewards are not a per-transaction cost, they&#x27;re a systemic cost.<p>And that cost is dropping. Money supply is just inherent to bitcoin&#x27;s design to kick it off, but it&#x27;s dropping to near zero within a few decades, unlike systemic costs of printing fiat which remain endlessly.<p>The long-term reward are transaction fees, and those are certainly quite cheap. You can move millions of dollars with pennies of fees, or you can make one transaction with thousands of outputs, also for mere pennies. Those fees can stay low as when you get 1.000x more transactions, you can pay for the same security with extremely small fees per transaction. (i.e. securing the system is expensive, again it&#x27;s a systemic cost, but securing each individual transaction isn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s just a cheap process of verifying a signature and storing 1/10th the amount of data of a tweet. So if you get enough transactions going, securing the system can be funded by very many very cheap transaction fees. And if you don&#x27;t get many transactions going, then bitcoin isn&#x27;t popular and well used anyway and who cares then if it doesn&#x27;t work? It&#x27;s like saying Myspace has technical flaws, nobody cares if it already failed to become popular that it would also have failed for technical reasons.<p>Bitcoin is imo unlikely to ever let you buy a cup of coffee using a single blockchain transaction (I mean, you can now, I&#x27;m talking sustaining this over the long term). Instead, it&#x27;ll be used as the value network on which financial systems are built that will allow you to do this. Whether that&#x27;s sidechains or offchains, they&#x27;ll all use bitcoin&#x27;s blockchain as a settling mechanism, without forcing low-value transactions on a permanent global ledger.",1421832710

Alongside these courses I&#x27;ve also been building my own websites using Django and I&#x27;m now at a stage where I feel I can solve any problem in any technology (even though it will take me longer than someone experienced in that technology to learn it and get stuff done).<p>I&#x27;ve started exploring other languages (C, Lisp, even Java at work, Haskell next, javascript) and feel much more confident with the software engineering stuff that CS courses don&#x27;t necessarily cover, having managed development teams (git, deployment, CI, TDD, etc).

I&#x27;m good at C. I understand the C mindset, to the extent it has one, and it isn&#x27;t especially conducive to OO. (It&#x27;s absolutely horrible with FP, because the fact you have to manage memory manually does terrible things to function composition.) Which would be fine, if C were actually a low-level language. It isn&#x27;t.<p>C gives you a simplified, high-level machine model. It isn&#x27;t <i>that</i> close to the machine; if it were, you&#x27;d have access to things like SIMD hardware and everything else C can&#x27;t give you because it would break portability.<p>(OK, you could possibly have access to them if you used C to implement an interpreter for a virtual machine. But that kind of defeats the purpose.)<p>So sure, implementing a non-trivial programming language is a fine goal; however, I&#x27;d do it by generating assembly language, because doing it in terms of C forces the programmer to adopt C&#x27;s limitations (every function has a single return value because there&#x27;s no real stack access; there&#x27;s no access to processor flags; no access to parallelism of any kind; etc. etc. etc.) for no real benefit in that context.

Haskell and parser combinators are interesting; Common Lisp and macros are interesting; Python is, again, not especially interesting, but at least with Python you&#x27;re debugging errors related to the problem domain, as opposed to errors related to the intricacies of manual memory management.<p>(Edited for comprehensibility as well.)",1421831963
8922221,comment,8908279,8909342,0,0,mackram,,,"curtis makes some excellent points about the whole concept of freelancing and how to make real long term work by bringing real value to your customers. These will generally not argue on price since they understand and see the value that the price is getting them (either increased income or decrease cost).
With that said, I personally would not think recommend the paid hourly work even with the structure of milestones. I have experimented with both hourly and fixed bid (as well as spent a couple of years working in business to understand their view point) and here is what I have found out from my own experiences (which should not be generalized of course):<p>* sometimes (read quite often in my experience) a high value solution to a client takes you a very little amount of time if you bill hourly you sell yourself short against the only measure that matters for your clients and that is how much value did this project bring me<p>* Hourly billing tends to make clients cut projects before the actual objective of the project is achieved so that they can save cost and what this means to you is that for this client (and anyone they talk to) the project was a- a failure and b- not completed by you<p>* Hourly billing allows you to choose to be lazy. What this means is that you will not take the time to assess the project and its scope because heck your are being paid by the hour and if you are lazy you get in trouble<p>* Clients need to assess risk to reward ratio of any project they take (just like you should) an open ended project is not a good thing for them. Without a cost it is difficult to assess whether a project ROI is useful.<p>Now with the above said there are times when billing by the hour is the only course of action. In my experience these are as follows:
* Old clients that have learned that you bring high value who want to grow their business strategically and want you to add iterations to them. These you can bill by the hour because there will be alot of time set aside discussing strategy and building for future and changing things. The key here is that they know you are worth it.
* New clients where are referred to you who do not know what they want. This is when a client can not tell you really why they want the project or what is its success metric. I usually stay clear of this unless I am sold on what the vision is since it is difficult to define success.<p>Warning however must be said you have to stand your ground when it comes to fixed bids scope.

Doesn&#x27;t have the same impact as the other word, but it&#x27;s still a slur.<p><i>Also, are you saying that the use of the word &#x27;mann&#x27; at that time was sexist?</i><p>I am saying that at the time, women were second-class citizens and largely considered to be in the social background. There aren&#x27;t a lot of women in the history books, for example. Saying that &#x27;mann&#x27; meant all humans in an era when women weren&#x27;t considered as equals doesn&#x27;t give the word a lot of credit as a gender-neutral word.<p>It&#x27;s a bit like how for a long time &#x27;the UK&#x27; and &#x27;England&#x27; were interchangeable. The UK had a couple of other countries in it that weren&#x27;t England, but people frequently referred to the group of them as &#x27;England&#x27;.<p><i>though, due to ignorance, _successfully_ avoiding all use of exclusionary language might be difficult</i><p>Difficult sure, but at the same time, still something to strive for. &#x27;man&#x27; and &#x27;mankind&#x27; are, at this point, purely rhetorical devices, both of which have plenty of alternatives.",1421831368

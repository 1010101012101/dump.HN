I'm not contradicting you here, but developing this idea. I'm always interested to hear the justification that people give for investing in blue-chip technology stocks like Apple and Google.

And not only do the innovators suffer, but so to do the consumers who are forced to pay higher prices because they can't get access to the value produced by the innovation.  It irks me because the retailers think they have some kind of right to exist.<p>Imagine you are living in a village where one guy gets paid for carrying water from the lake.  Then one day, some other guy builds a pipe and a pump - the first guy is out of a job!  So he goes to the village chief, who bans everyone from using the pipe to get their water so that the first guy could keep his job.<p>That's clearly insane to my mind - and was wondering if the HN community concurs or if they see the other side.",1290585262
1936803,comment,1935508,1936714,0,0,mjb,,,"Optimisation for stealth against bistatic and multistatic radar systems is a different problem from the monostatic case. The important thing is the split between the position of the transmitter and receiver. In the monostatic (transmitter and receiver in the same place) case, you need to optimise to reduce radar energy reflected back in the direction of the transmitter.<p>When the receiver and transmitter are split, this problem gets harder, because you need to optimise to reduce radar energy transmitted back in the direction that recievers are likely to be (or don't reflect any, but that's a different problem). This becomes even harder in multi-receiver systems, and even harder in multi-receiver-multi-transmitter systems. As computation power and communication bandwidth becomes cheaper, lower power, smaller and easier to hide, many of the assumptions used during the development of the current generation (and past generations) of stealth aircraft are becoming invalid.<p>Passive location systems, either secondary radars or systems using 'transmitters of opportunity' also reduce the effectiveness of anti-radiation weapons significantly.<p>The radar vs. stealth arms race continues.",1290585076

But cynical commentary on ruthless VCs aside, I think ""stopped believing in games"" is probably accurate. Here's why.<p>The gaming biz had largely stepped away from PC platforms in favor of consoles and decreased piracy. PC based gaming had bifurcated into two major areas: casual games (Bejeweled) and server-based games (World of Warcraft), with the original gaming market being a rather beleaguered middle ground.<p>And various firms had tried to replicate success in these new areas. But as may be obvious, once WoW beat Everquest, nobody's been able to dethrone them. And casual games were... well, everywhere. Kongregate, MSN Games, Yahoo Games, Real Arcade, ad nauseum. No big differentiators. Easy to knock off. And not very lucrative without enormous scale.<p>So when investors heard ""new game company"" their usual inclination was ""nope, next"". And venture capital is a business that ultimately doesn't thrive on risk but instead on as close as they can get to the sure thing, which is why you see so many clones of any business that seems to be doing it right... latest trend being Groupon. VCs are looking for a reason to say no early so they can get back to looking for other opportunities, working with their existing portfolio companies, or the other things that occupy their time (public speaking, golf, etc). There could be fabulous opportunities in a business but they are often dismissed as ""in the wrong space"" - regardless of the success of that firm - if that space is out of vogue.",1290584130

Google has already thought about the tough questions like ""what happens if an entire datacenter goes offline?"" and GAE has that designed in.<p>Developing for failure doesn't make sense when you're operating on a small scale, but it makes a lot of sense when you do need to scale.  I'd rather take a bit of a development hit up front when there are few users than take the hit when a site really gains traction.",1290583988

By the time I left I decided not to bother exercising my options for pennies a share. The company never went public. None of the many people I knew working for startups at the time saw a dime of profit from their options either.<p>The stock I got from the much larger, already public company I worked for next turned out to be worth a nice chunk of change though.",1290582385

The UI is almost completely keyboard-driven and fast, and stripped down to bare bones. It's a desktop app that runs on OS X and Windows. It has fast search dialog accessible with one keystroke.<p>Like OmniOutliner/Workflowy, though, it also is hierarchy-oriented, which I think is most natural for ordered tasks. It has a slight learning curve and the UI is very utilitarian, but it has drastically reduced the amount of stuff I have to keep in my head as I'm working.",1290582265

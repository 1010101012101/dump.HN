381840,comment,381737,381737,0,0,JoelSutherland,,,"I don't think it is fair to blame unions for Detroit's problems.  A union's motives are clear: to maximize income of its members.<p>The fault lies with management. They agreed to terms with the unions that have made it impossible to run a profitable business. The writing has been on the wall for a very long time.  The pension and benefit issues have not silently crept up in the last couple of years.  It has been an issue for decades.<p>So now Detroit is screwed. Their only outs are to default on the pensions they legally owe or to have taxpayers cover their debts.<p>Repayment on a loan isn't realistic when their cost structure is so screwed up.  A loan now will only delay the inevitable.<p>The only realistic solution is for the automakers to declare bankruptcy, allowing the courts to decide what to do about their obligations.",1228150502

381831,comment,381803,381803,0,0,swombat,,,"I think there is another possible outcome than forcing everyone to ""be on their best behaviour"" all the time.<p>Many things are today regarded as inappropriate that are really not that important. Who cares whether such and such intern (or even CEO) once dressed up as a woman at a party. Only bigotry keeps people turning up their nose at such trivial nonsense.<p>As behaviour that was previously hidden and taboo becomes more and more visible, there are two possible outcomes:<p>1) (proposed by the article) the behaviour is eliminated because it cannot be tolerated. This would likely be the case for disastrous behaviours such as child abuse and conjugal violence, which, as they become more visible, are unlikely to be tolerated.<p>2) Social norms evolve and learn to tolerate that behaviour.<p>I think it is not unthinkable that in the near future many behaviours which are today still looked down upon will be accepted as normal and irrelevant to most considerations. In the inevitable collision between outdated laws/social norms and the huge masses of people who do the forbidden anyway, history tells us that the huge masses of people win.<p>(of course, do whatever you need to ensure you don't become roadkill on this march...)",1228150007

Anyone serious about programming should <i>definitely</i> make sure to have something like this in hand before they leave, if they want the good opportunities.<p>Of course, side project + prestigious college is a winning combo... but even then, I'd say it's the side project dominating for most good employers.<p>I would imagine in fields where the means of production (whatever they may be) are not so much in the hands of the masses that the college distinction could be more important; how do you prove yourself a competent civil engineer with a side project?

10083878,story,,,1,0,gizi,"Desktop personas",,"I use different desktop personas to protect different silos of data from attacks (viruses, trojans, privacy infringement ....) that could occur on another silo. For example, I use Gmail in another desktop than where I generally surf the web. Otherwise, there is always a risk that the Gmail full-identity cookie mixes up with the site&#x27;s Google Analytics cookie, and that this information gets logged somewhere. I store bitcoins in a completely isolated silo. At the moment, I use Virtualbox to manage these data silos. In fact, this is a bit of overkill, because it would be enough to use different user accounts in the same OS image. Unfortunately, it seems to take much more time to switch user accounts -- you also need to provide a password -- than firing up another virtual machine. Does anybody know of a fast and convenient method or program to just switch user accounts (safely) instead of firing up virtual machines?",1439963885

Any crooked peer can route into the dreaded Omaha and to a crooked NY peer faster than any safe route can go west through Asia. A crooked peer can forge sequential MACs showing a &#x27;legitimate&#x27; looking route easily.<p>So, I would reformulate the claims to &quot;If a packet is never routed to an attacker that can route through a forbidden zone more quickly than obeying the restrictions, there is a valid alibi routing.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to come up with a good use case for this protocol, in my mind. Especially because we are most often concerned with packet routing at the destination and source, and for legal reasons, not inspection reasons.<p>It&#x27;s largely understood by anyone who might possibly be using alibi routing that packets are often inspected in flight, and there is nothing you can do about it, and that furthermore the concepts of safe or unsafe nations or regions or cities are almost laughable when it comes to even the smallest nation state&#x27;s avaricious desire for inspection and storage of data flying by.",1439963852

It works as well. In many cases you&#x27;re talking to people who are buying their first or second PC - but even here you&#x27;d be surprised by the market perceptions you have to overcome: people believe they can &quot;get a job&quot; if they know Windows, and that Mac&#x27;s are stylish (aka a status symbol), and that Linux is too hard or for geeks only.<p>A lot of general users are surprised when you should them that Linux can do everything that a &#x27;normal user&#x27; wants their computer to do - quickly and easily - at a price that is way better than the other options. No command lines involved.<p>In the spirit of root cause analysis you might ask, &#x27;why there is no advertising?&#x27; at the level you&#x27;re talking about. And the basic answer is that Linux is a difficult proposition for the hardware OEMS: it&#x27;s a cost to them, and the users perceive it as &#x27;free&#x27; so hard to pass that onto them. Whereas, Windows is margin to them, and obviously Apple makes most of it&#x27;s margin on hardware sales. If you go a step further back then the underlying issue is that the client PC sector doesn&#x27;t make a lot of money - all the large manufacturers struggle. So it&#x27;s a pretty conservative segment. It&#x27;s a low margin market that demands a lot of volume: the equivalent dynamic to supermarkets. That&#x27;s why RedHat said it wasn&#x27;t a segment for them, and why Ubuntu/Canonical puts a lot of energy into shipping volume in developing markets.<p>Ultimately, I think user networks are far more important than traditional distribution. Advocates and friendly support networks work. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s much more important to convince others to use Linux, and to greet all Linux users as part of the same family - rather than fighting over whatever flavour of <init/desktop env/editor/etc> is the &quot;true way&quot;!",1439963445

That is, toss out the crappy consumer routers and instead embrace the router as a user-controlled computer that sits between the user&#x27;s devices (including IoT devices) and the ISP connection (e.g., modem).  This router could run an open source source OS and be programmed _by the user_ to do all sorts of useful things, such as block ads, block tracking, perhaps even create private overlay networks among family and friends, protected from spam.<p>In a world where the Internet user can have some respite from radio, TV and other advertising, Google (=slave to advertisers) should not be selling routers.

As a CS researcher, I occasionally think, what would be the #1 thing I&#x27;d do if my sole goal were to chase career success in academia? And it would be this: transition into a currently hot, well-funded applied area like cybersecurity, cancer research, or climate modeling (or big-data analytics, or robotics, or a few other such things). A lot of things just become easier if your research aligns with the current opinion among deans and funding agencies regarding which areas are important. So he did... exactly that as an <i>alternative</i> to chasing success?<p>I mean it&#x27;s certainly believable that he moved to those areas because he&#x27;s personally interested in them, rather than just following the money. If so, he had the good fortune that his personal interests aligned closely with the current priority areas of major U.S. funding agencies. There are plenty of cases where that isn&#x27;t true, so I think it&#x27;s a bit dangerous to take it as the normal outcome. If your passion is something people with money are not currently interested in, the odds that everything will just work out fine if you focus on your passion are much lower. So my modified advice would be: to get tenure, follow your passion and solve problems rather than micro-optimizing citations, <i>but</i> first macro-optimize research area by choosing problems that the NIH, NSF, and/or DARPA are pouring money into. :-)",1439962351

That&#x27;s because it is a <i>complex</i> process which requires <i>mangling</i> the packets and keeping lots of <i>state</i> in a big table.<p>QoS however is relatively cheap. It&#x27;s merely looking at fixed offsets in the IP packets and deciding which of those (mangled) packets must go now and which can go later. It requires some extra memory for some extra packet-queues, and a lookup in one of iptables&#x27; smallest rulesets. That&#x27;s about it.<p>Yes, I routed things at slower speeds, but you got to have a perspective on things: You must NAT all the traffic, but only need to QoS the outgoing traffic.<p>This means that if the downstream speeds have increased 100x recent years while upbound speeds only 10x (which is my fair assesment of the market), your NAT cost is now 110x higher, while the QoS cost is merely 10x.<p>And QoS was the cheap load. If your router is already buried in other work, I&#x27;m sure QoS will feel extra painful, but so would anything else. On a healthy load you probably wont see it in the load-graphs at all.<p>Also worth keeping in mind is that QoS as a feature has diminishing returns the higher upload-rates you have. If you have 128kbps upload, making sure the right packets get out first is excessively important. If you have Gigabit upload, not only will QoS be more expensive, but you are almost guaranteed to have no benefit from it what so ever.<p>So yeah, I stand by my argument. QoS is not a heavy feature, even though marketed as such.",1439961255

The wifi jamming being discussed does not interfere with any existing radio communications, it adds extra packets of data that the client device interprets.

The tech i would be using is JavaScript, jQuery and Kendo UI.

Instead, the Fed buys various kinds of debt, especially US govt bonds, thus injecting money into the economy.  The fed funds rate is really the rate at which banks lend to each other.  Banks are privileged in that they have a special legal mandate to act as banks, but they are not privileged in terms of access to credit (they can borrow at the &quot;discount window&quot; but this is less important than the Fed&#x27;s open market operations).<p>But more importantly, QE is more like injecting money into &quot;real things&quot; since it is buying corporate debt that presumably funds real projects.  So the (alleged) failure of QE is not very good evidence for your claim that standard monetary policy is bad.<p>EDIT: and they main reason I and most economists prefer US style monetary policy is that it&#x27;s very neutral: you have a lever, and that lever is how much bonds you buy.  You can choose various flavors of bonds, and various maturities, but they are all fundamentally the same.  In contrast, the government directly funding real projects lends itself to corruption and favoritism.",1439960434

1013796,comment,1013545,1013545,0,0,SingAlong,,,"I think this idea has been worked on by a lot of people too.<p>Way back in Hackday India 2007 a group of guys worked on an app called Socialrouting which was hosted at socialrouting.com (it's currently down). It allowed users to mark and view routes with respect to landmarks and also allow people to update traffic in a particular area via an SMS to the SocialRouting twitter account, which was then transferred to the map on the site. I was impressed by the way Pradeep (one of the dev) gave a talk at a Barcamp about their mashup.<p>And now, I guess that was the idea that morphed into Mapunity <a href=""http://www.mapunity.in"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mapunity.in</a> which they are currently working on. It provides live traffic data for a few cities in India. These guys provide services to govt organisations.<p>P.S: I used their Traffic API in Hackday India 2009 :D thats how I know about them :)",1261662721

How was I supposed to have heard of them?<p>However, I can feel the pain in a way: a lot of possible projects I can think of are in danger of being made redundant by some Google project or other. Sometimes I worry about my own future - will there even be things to do in the future, without the backing of a huge corporation with ginormous data centers behind it? Should I do everything I can to become part of a giant corporation now, to be on the save side?<p>But as Yoda says, fear leads to suffering, so probably it is best not to worry about it too much.<p>Also, I suppose there will always be customers who don't want to use Google out of principle. But Google will probably have the lions share.<p>And, Google seems to be strange in a way: they do a lot of things, but only a few things properly. Many cool projects they have just end up being incomplete and poorly tended to.",1261660962

1013773,story,,,1,0,Aegean,"Tell HN: If it is an ideal solution, it will be costly",,"This has been repeated many times and it has struck me just now, so I wanted to share it. Whenever we find a contractor to do work for us, if they are the right fit for the work their price will almost always be higher than expected (i.e. very high). From now on whenever I find a provider that looks ideal, I will think about the cost implication before going ahead.<p>Normally I would choose to go for an expensive provider without hesitation, since the work would require less management from our side. But now I feel that a more refined plan of action requires taking that it will be 2 or 3-fold more expensive as granted, and thinking whether it is worth paying that much more. What do you think?",1261660744
1013772,comment,1013545,1013697,0,0,illumen,,,"yeah, nice point.  The standard way to give credit in academia is to list references throughout a work.<p>It's funny that on the proof it reads - 'By ANDREW WILES*'.  So even there he was giving credit.  It also mentions Fermat in the title, and within the first paragraph references a bunch of others.<p>Many open source projects use a section in their README, or a CREDITS file, or a credits link on their web pages... or a 'powered by X'.  Many do all of these things.<p>Web pages often have a tiny link with 'made by X, designed by X, or powered by X'.<p>The business world often does not have this credit giving culture.  Some times you might see 'coffee beans roasted by X' or other little notes on shop windows.  Perhaps the employee of the month is another example.<p>I guess the main point of the original poster is that they would have liked to be given some credit for their work... and that they felt sad and a little depressed to see google taking their credit.  They want people to know that they made that and not google - despite what the google marketing machine is telling people.<p>-- merry xmas",1261660650

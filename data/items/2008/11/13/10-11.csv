Think about facebook and how they dominated one niche then opened it up to everyone else; this model has been used many times successfully for platform companies. The hardest part about this is maintaining focus on the beachhead when you get popular, and saying no to other segments. until you are ready.",1226573657

However, to your point, we need a killer app to really show the potential of the platform. Arguably though, it might make the most sense to simply target my original use case, and build the platform for developers who want to add mobile features to their products but don't want to spend huge amounts of time figuring out exactly how to do so in a scalable and highly-available way.",1226573536

362943,comment,362906,362929,0,0,cte,,,"I realize now that we didn't show a stateful app, but basically an application is run in steps, and the boundaries between steps are the calls for user input because the app must pause to wait for input. So we store the last instruction executed and halt the app. Then when input is provided, the app is restored at the proper point and continues running. It is not ruby specific, but it is _much_ easier to build this with interpreted languages.<p>I don't think we have the killer app yet, but we implemented a mobile interface to google calendar with ~5 lines of code which I've been using for a little while, and its surprisingly useful. When all is said and done, I think we might want to simply pitch this as a platform for adding mobile features to your existing app, so it becomes more of a developer tool than a consumer facing product.<p>As for monitoring, yes, it becomes a tricky task to achieve high availability (and scalability), but its a really fun problem to tackle :)",1226573046

What I'm doing right now is building the pre and post-sales engineering/support groups for a hardware-based startup.  We're bringing a new and interesting product to market, and several of us are out in the streets everyday saying ""Hey! Want to buy a hot dog?"". Tradeshows, marketing events, pretty much all the standard stuff.  And, like the hot dog man, we're doing very very well with it so far.<p>Every day, though, I must hear about how the industry we're in and the world in general is cutting back spending, slowing down their purchases and so on.  It would be very easy to listen to this news, and scale back our efforts and go off to cower somewhere.  If we did this, we'd surely sell much less hotdogs than we do now.<p>A big part of my job is keeping folks in the sales team motivated, focused and ready to spot hot-dog selling opportunities.  This story was deeply parallel to things encountered at our startup every week.  It was a bit inspiring to me, and I thought it might also be a bit inspiring to people who are in the same position.",1226572979

A platform is not a business.<p>""We don't really know what widgets are."" Following on the point above, you're creating a platform (a non-specific, generic ""thingy"") for creating widgets (non-specific, generic ""thingies"") for the mobile web (something that's not even really defined properly yet. Non-specific businesses are almost without exception failures. Only huge businesses like Sun and Microsoft and Amazon can afford to release ""platforms"" without going broke.<p>Here's the most valuable advice you can get at this point if you want to build a start-up (that's a <i>business</i>, meaning it needs a path to making money) is:<p>Find one or two specific customers who have a need that this fills, and fill it, and get them to pay for it. Specific wins the day.<p>Since you've built a platform, you may well have to go one step closer to customers before you can help them. Design an application that people will be willing to pay for, using your (admittedly very cool) platform. Then, once you have your app and you have profits, over time you might want to open up the platform to other people.<p>Repeat once more: a business is an entity that makes money. A platform is not a business.",1226572793

That&#x27;s not what rigor looks like.<p>One time I was asked for the run time of a random-line-getter function for a file that seeks to a random byte and fans out to the line breaks.  I said, &quot;well, that would depend, not on the file size, but the line length, and it would be linear in that.&quot;<p>He &quot;got me&quot;: &quot;Wrong, it&#x27;s constant.&quot;  Indeed, if you implicitly assume that relevant parameter is file size, and don&#x27;t understand the implications of &quot;does not depend on ...&quot;, then you can compare answers against an answer key and regard someone as wrong for not saying exactly that.<p>&quot;Hashtables are O(1)&quot; results from exactly that lack of rigor, where it&#x27;s all a game of which password to spit back, rather than &quot;can you identify the constraints on solving this problem?&quot;",1443747574

Regardless...<p>How did they detect when a US citizen was using a phone abroad, or a terrorist using a landline phone in the USA? Identities are not tied to phones.<p>Furthermore, how secure is the system they used? Can adversaries tap in to the NSA database? Is the filtering &quot;hard wired&quot; or is it something that is programmable and how susceptible is it to bugs, viruses, or hacking? How trustworthy are the people that control this data? Is it possible that anyone that works at the NSA is not trustworthy and might defect? Such as Edward Snowden?<p>These are important questions. Even with &#x27;filtering&#x27; there is a lot of questions to be asked. And I doubt all them have great answers. The point is, there is a system in place to problematically spy on any phone conversation at any time among other things. Even if they use it &quot;for good,&quot; that should be very concerning for anyone that knows that programming secure systems is mostly an effort in futility. Especially for the government who can&#x27;t even code up a CRUD healthcare website without issue - and that the system is completely closed source not allowing others to review it.<p>Which brings us to another issue - why was this secret? Isn&#x27;t this the kind of thing that should be approved by USA citizens? And publically verified for safety and security? This alone is so concerning.<p>I&#x27;m happy you think &quot;filtering&quot; makes all of these questions a non-issue though.",1443747491

We are hiring for mobile, backend & front-end. We are tech stack agnostic. We would prefer to have a look at your GitHub repo or a mobile app that you have built, over your academic/educational qualification. We are a founding team of engineers, and understand that good engineering is part science part art, we would like to provide you the tools for the science and the time for the art. We are expanding the team to build the next version of our true multi-tenant platform with a few thousand events happening per second.<p>Data Scientists: We wish to push to edge of what is possible, and advance the field of routing problems itself. If Travelling thief, Knapsack, Capacity planning and other optimisation problem excite you, we are looking for you. We are team of PhD scientists and engineers with background in stats, working on building faster & more scalable implementation of NP-hard problems, or even a combination of a few NP-Hard problems.<p>While we have pizza, beer, whisky, drones, oculus rifts, raspberry PIs on the house, the biggest perk we provide you is a remarkable team. We would love to spend our most productive years, around people with great intellect and unbridled enthusiasm.

This assumption isn&#x27;t generally wrong, but like all assumptions it has its limits.<p>I personally think the blind mantra that &quot;hash tables are O(1)&quot; is destructive because it fosters an intuition that they&#x27;re akin to a pointer dereference and strictly better than trees, when really that constant factor is <i>huge</i>. After all, when memory is bounded (and it always is on any physical machine), <i>every</i> algorithm is O(1)!<p>Given that the hash table construction is designed specifically to be constant-time on the model of a modern microprocessor, I think it makes sense to look under the hood a bit and see how it really behaves if memory and nkeys are truly unbounded.<p>And in this case, that result is indeed informative when you start thinking about things like cache hierarchy. The assumption of a table &quot;fitting in memory&quot; goes out the window when for a given size, &quot;memory&quot; could be L2 cache with a higher access speed, or not.<p>In that previous thread you say:<p>> <i>the defining (good) thing about STEM is that there&#x27;s actual logic to the discipline, where if I forget an answer, I can re-derive it</i><p>Each letter of S.T.E.M. is its own field with its own methods.

Specifically, math works by having a foundation of assumptions for each problem, and outside of that context any solution is meaningless.<p>For this particular topic, &quot;assume keys are fixed size&quot; is an assumption you just have to memorize the idea of, just like for big-O notation in general you have to memorize the assumption that constant factors don&#x27;t matter.",1443745101

You can&#x27;t sell something, take somebody&#x27;s money, and then just not deliver. What you are selling to investors, generally, is return on investment.<p>The real problem comes in because founders and VCs have different understandings of &quot;grow fast&quot;. There will come choices that have different levels of risk. VCs always want you to take the high-risk, high-reward path, because they have a portfolio company and are looking for the few really big winners. You, on the other hand, are trying to build something (team, community, product, etc), and so you will favor slower but safer growth.<p>I guess in theory you could sell VCs on a high-growth approach and then turn around and say, &quot;Ha ha, fuck you, we&#x27;re going to keep your money and try to grow modestly.&quot; But a) VCs are way better at their game than you are, so they&#x27;re hard to fool, and b) then you&#x27;re an asshole, which is bad on its own and also has consequences for future relationships (and future funding).

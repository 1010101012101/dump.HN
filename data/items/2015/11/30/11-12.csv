The problem doesn&#x27;t specify that the opponent chooses their numbers from a range, or anything else - all that&#x27;s given is that there are two numbers and we know nothing about them. And if that&#x27;s the case then it follows that any random number we choose might be between them, in which case our strategy beats chance. Note that nobody&#x27;s claiming our choice is <i>likely</i> to be between the opponent&#x27;s choices, just that the possibility hasn&#x27;t ruled out. None of this makes any assumptions about their numbers.<p>If you&#x27;re hung up on the possibility that the opponent chooses numbers so as to counter this strategy, the author points out elsewhere that if you pick a number from an unbounded range (like a normal distribution) then you&#x27;ll have a nonzero (though vanishingly small) chance of falling between <i>any</i> two numbers the opponent chooses.",1448884680

My logic for it is more based in how I, as a mostly anti-capitalist* thinks capital works.<p>The trick for me is whether, like China, Nigeria will grow its own industry, or like say, Bangladesh, where the long-term prospects continue to be mostly external exploitation.<p>This depends on so many things, such as how property and capital are treated culturally, whether there&#x27;s a strong entrepreneurial or self-directed narrative.<p>Then there&#x27;s the possibility that the investments themselves may not be honored.  There&#x27;s been a history of countries electing leaders that kick out foreign investors and seize the land, factories, and industries.<p>This is especially an issue, because I&#x27;d expect return in a Lagos investment, if it were to come, to be big but on a 5-15 year scale, not 12-18 month.  I think I&#x27;ve got only 1 holding at most, in my portfolio that I&#x27;ve had for 15 years.  Committing to Lagos for that time period just sounds like a trip to Vegas.

The &quot;why&quot; is the big question.  Gregg Braden has showed that our planet has a varying temperature for millions of years and we should try to understand what is behind this.  One thing is clear and that it is not a higher level of CO2 or less Ozon.  It is a smart thing to ask ourselves also the question &quot;Which factors contribute to climate change?&quot;.  The documentary COWSPIRACY shows that 54% of the CO2 production comes from the meat industry.  So the biggest gains are not with &quot;clean&quot; energy but with &quot;clean&quot; meat.  CO2 production increases significantly when the population and meat consumption increases so figure out what the priorities for &quot;clean&quot; meat and &quot;clean&quot; energy should be.",1448883451

However, it seems like the mythical idea of an automatic caching HTTP proxy at the ISP level never really materialized. Perhaps that was possible in the HTTP days, but HTTPS makes it a challenge.<p>How much better would Internet congestion be if there was a way for ISPs to cache commonly-referenced resources? They could even be video resources - if Netflix requests its videos across an HTTP connection by identifying a single common resource (a URL everyone will access who plays the video), then an ISP could simply cache the URL and serve it locally.<p>It seems like HTTPS is a barrier to schemes like that. Instead of an ISP running a generic cache for commonly-referenced resources, each website provider needs to run a local POP that&#x27;s trusted and knows just their content. (Though maybe Cloudflare like solutions are possible where the POP is not fully trusted.)<p>If we set HTTPS aside for a moment, could we speed the Internet up with caching? How much of the traffic to saturated links are requests for the same content over and over again?<p>Is there a conceptual way to achieve some of the privacy benefits from HTTPS while allowing an ISP to cache content in a generic way?

Most aren&#x27;t even aware that there is a difference between English English and American English.  One step up from that are those that aware that there <i>is</i> a difference, to the point that they actually think that the two are very nearly distinct languages, and that people from England may have trouble understanding Americans. After that you have the people that actually understand the true difference between the two versions of the language, but even they rarely understand that the US is actually the exception, and that pretty much all other English-speaking countries use English spelling (well, there is Canada, which decided to sit on the fence between the two, I suppose).",1448881887

10648816,comment,10644539,10648061,0,0,atmosx,,,"I used OpenBSD&#x27;s spamd (not to be confused with spam-assasin&#x27;g binary). Spamd greylisting is extremely effective but hard to configure properly. It assumes that every SMTPd[1] out there respects the RFC: When a mail is rejected for whatever reason, should be sent again using the prior IP address to get whitelisted. Google and nearly all corps/mail providers switch IP address when they re-send an email. It&#x27;s probably a measure to circumvent IP-based blocks, but it breaks OpenBSD spamd&#x27;s implementation. If you&#x27;re in a hurry or expecting an important email, you&#x27;re out of luck. It might take 12-24 hours before the mail finally reaches your mailbox, which is simply not acceptable.<p>That said, the amount of spam using spamd fell to nearly 95% on the other hand I had to whitelist manually 81 IP addresses in ~ 6 months.",1448881789

The prices are not made from the costs of the components but from the market. Sodium batteries will have trouble to compete price wise in the beginning, because the production industry must be build in Europe and compete against an established industry in Asia. On the long run, you may be right. But for introduction, I have strong doubts. Needs a good marketing, as they have the same capacity, but are heavier.",1448881452

Think of it like compound interest, or a really big ball in Katamari Damacy, only for geopolitical power. That is, the US can arrange things in its favor to make it more powerful just because it's already quite powerful and no other country is.<p>As an example, the United States Dollar is the de-facto reserve currency for the rest of the world. That means that the US can purchase things without having to first go through (expensive) currency exchange, giving the US an economic advantage. The reserve currency status is also a major factor that also allows the US to borrow money pretty much at will.<p>Similar arguments can be made about cultural, military, diplomatic, and other power.<p>That means that countries aspiring to be the superpower have the deck stacked against them. So when, despite this, China overtakes the US, the US will have an awful lot of catching up to do. It's not fighting for food in the streets, but it would be a fairly serious blow to the US.",1303754165

They are run by a one party dictatorship.  They run essentially a centrally directed, command economy.  They are still so poor that on average they have a tough time even getting enough rice for their people.<p>So, starting from where they are, they can get a fantastic rate of growth basically borrowing science, technology, and finance from America.  BUT:  Once they quit crawling, get up on all fours, and start walking, then they will face the fact that they have some serious problems:  (1) Total suckage for a constitution.  (2) Similarly for their political and legal systems and human rights, e.g., little things like freedom of the press.  (3) Next to nothing in 'democratic traditions'.  (4) A lot of filthy air and water.  (5) A population with a quite old average age.<p>So, once they are standing, their people will want to do things about (1)-(5).  As a country, they will struggle.  The struggles may become violent.  On ""One fine day"" (I know, Japan, not China), they will get (1)-(4) solved; solving (5) will be harder.<p>Then they will be about where America was in, say, 1950.  As they move ahead, actually to do better than America they will have to do well with things that are new, with pushing the envelope, with making progress on new ground.  Then they will begin to see the enormous advantages of political freedom, freedom to cut new ground in our research universities, free enterprise, freedom of the press, freedom in art, guarantees of freedom from an oppressive government, etc.  They will still have the problem of a population with too old average age and a bad ratio of people to land and natural resources.<p>Net, bet on the economy in China continuing to grow rapidly for some years, but don't bet on China actually beating America in any significant sense this century.",1303753790

The police could always get at this, thats not the issue at hand.<p>What people are complaining about is the consolidated.db file which appears to be a cache of general locations of where wifi SSID's are located. It also keeps a log of where the phone was in general when a call was placed. This is on the phone and is just an sqlite3 db, pick it open and have a look.<p>Now why, from an engineering perspective, is this necessary? Answer, it isn't, at least not entirely. LocationServices is the likely answer. There are api calls you can make that amount to ""Give me the general location of the phone accurate to Xmetres."" that don't invoke the gps unless needed to save battery life. Say you're hooked up to your wifi at home and the phone has cached this ssid/wifi point do you really need the gps to give you a location accurate to 1000 metres if the app just wants to know the state you're in? No, so you cache some of this information in this little db and give a general ""around here is where i'm at"" reply when the app just wants a general idea of location. So with this in mind, would Jobs be wrong in stating that they don't track you? No he would be 100% accurate as a cache used to help save battery life isn't tracking you, its a cache.<p>Now as to the backups containing the file, thats rather obvious as they are backups and exposes the need for an individual to encrypt the backups. You should be doing this already. Anyone here that doesn't encrypt their phone's backups, be it android or ios, shouldn't be calling themselves a hacker. Its a known source of private data, if you aren't encrypting it, you are accepting risk if someone gets a hold of it. Just make sure your family members also do this, you're likely the geek of the family, help them with a bit of good information.<p>What worries people is if the consolidated.db gets sent or uploaded in some fashion. The data isn't all that useful for tracking you since the location data for SSID's are general and don't appear to update each time you see them, and the call data only seems to use cell triangulation and only when the call was placed. Could you use this to track someone? Sure but no more than you could by tailing them in a car or following them.<p>The comments for this post are a bit appalling for what I've come to expect from this site. There is way too much hyperbole and vitriol in most of these comments. I'm not trying to advocate for Apple, more to set people straight on actual facts as we currently know them. Those with developer accounts should look at the 2010 WWDC video 150 iirc (at work so can't verify, was that or 151), should shed some light on things. I'd rather we have an actual discussion over the amount of data we store on these handheld devices and the ""security"" and lack thereof around them. To me there is a lot more that can be done in general, be it android or ios or whatever to secure things. Lashing out at one vendor here isn't helpful, we need the whole industry to recognize the issues. For starters I would like some very fine grained controls ala selinux to control what apps get access to what. Down to the contact level if need be.

I knew this when I wrote the GP.  My whole point is that <i>they treated it</i> as a ""networked storage is broken"" problem even though it wasn't, because of their ""ZFS is the only tech we need"" bias.  Thanks for re-stating that.<p>As for ""DAS is the right choice"" that's just wrong on many levels.  First, people who know storage use ""DAS"" to both private (e.g. SATA/SAS) and shared (e.g. FC/iSCSI) storage, so please misusing the term to make a distinction between the two.  Second, I don't actually recommend either.  I don't recommend paying enterprise margins for anything, and I don't recommend more than a modicum of private storage for cloud applications where most data ultimately needs to be shared.  What I do recommend is distributed storage based on commodity hardware and open-source software.  There are plenty of options to choose from, some with all of the scalability and redundancy you could get from their enterprise cousins.  Just because some people had some bad experience with iSCSI or DRBD doesn't mean all cost-effective distributed storage solutions are bad and one must submit to the false choice of enterprise NAS vs. (either flavor of) DAS.<p>In short, open your eyes and read what people wrote instead of assuming this is the NAS vs. DAS fight you're used to.",1303752193

I can keep consuming however I like, comfortable in the knowledge that I'm not causing harm to anyone else"". Yes, dysfunctional governments and economies in developing countries are part of the problem, and no matter what rich people do or do not consume, they probably won't help the hungry people in N. Korea by doing so. But there are plenty of places where that's not the case. The fact that the 2007-2008 food crisis <i>did</i> meaningfully impact a lot of people in developing countries should indicate that we <i>are</i> all connected to the same global food economy, and what we do with our agricultural resources in rich countries can and does impact the prices and availability in developing ones.",1303751679

(This reasons for this are a whole other conversation.)<p>""Why does Apple track me?"" ""We don't"" - Apple is not AT&T. Maybe Apple doesn't take a copy of the data. Maybe Apple takes a copy of the data without associating it to your or your phone. Any of this qualifies under the [im]precise language of the question.<p>How about we ask the purpose of that log the phone makes? Let's also ask who gets a copy. If just having something on your computer ""makes it easy for bad guys to get,"" then all your files are ""easy to get"" and you might want to learn something about securing your computers.<p>EDIT:\nOK, perhaps I'm a bit hasty:<p>""Could you please explain the necessity of the passive location-tracking tool embedded in my iPhone?""<p>""We don't track anyone.""<p>That's definitely sidestepping the issue.

Although the tips are presented as recommendations for somebody starting a religion, the important part is that they are based on recent studies about the brain quirks that produce religions or at least enable them.\nI find some of those tips are also useful for startup founders, especially when creating a team of believers and keeping it focused on the goals.\nFor example, traumatic rites of passage which are either painful or scary seem to be good generators of cohesiveness. Whether by intention or by the nature of the process, startups engage in this practice: YC forces applicants to take a leap of faith and relocate; founders work interminable hours in not very healthy conditions; some startups adopt some kind of initiation.\nOther good tips are to keep preaching the doctrine, and to allow dissent to a certain degree.\nHaving recently read Delivering Happiness by Tony Hsieh, Zappos  CEO, I could not avoid making some connections between the book and this article. Of course, you have to read the article with the right light o see them.",1303750837

3606437,comment,3605242,3605852,1,0,_delirium,,,"<i>Beginner to intermediate just-about-anything isn't ""fun"" and won't inspire feelings of ""passion"" or ""love"".</i><p>I haven't found that to be universally true. Beginner to intermediate programming is <i>really great</i>, if you start it in a sensible way that foregrounds some of why it's interesting up front, with enough tools to let you make <i>something</i> happen fairly soon. The first 30 minutes of playing with Logo when I was in elementary school were amazingly eye-opening, and I couldn't put it down for weeks! It was pretty awesome really, you could give these commands to draw turtle graphics, and then change them to draw others, and then learn new techniques to make fancier things, etc., etc.<p>Unfortunately I think most people approach programming less in the way Papert was trying to promote, and more in the coding-death-march sort of way where you take a high-school class that lectures about C++ syntax for weeks. The hacker scene has a better angle on it, imo; plenty of first-time attendees at places like SuperHappyDevHouse and Maker Faire see an inspiring side of technology they missed in school.",1329566248

( Some of which posted below)<p>---     CNET take this article down, as it's absolutely, 100% false. THIS PATENT WAS NOT AWARDED. It is a published patent application, which is in no way shape or form the same thing. You're just trolling for pageviews if you leave this up at this point.\nPosted by thesimulacra (13 comments )<p>--- The link provided with ""Google last week was awarded a patent it filed for back in 2010 that describes a manner..."" is a US Patent Application PUBLICATION. It is not a PATENT yet. The status is ""Docketed New Case - Ready for Examination"", which said clearly it is not examined yet.<p>--- This isn't the first time CNET has done this. To the author of this article: you are misleading everyone who doesn't know anything about patents when you write a story like this. GOOGLE HAS NOT BEEN GRANTED ANYTHING by this publication. (Almost) All patent patent applications automatically publish 18 months after they are filed, regardless of what they disclose and claim. I could file an application that claims ""a paperclip"" and it would publish just like the Google application has here. That says nothing about whether it will be ISSUED to grant any rights to me.<p>The application (which has now published for the public to inspect) is pending examination, as noted above. It hasn't been examined and therefore has not yet been subjected to rejection by the Patent & Trademark Office.",1329564609

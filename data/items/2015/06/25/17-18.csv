You would be surprised at the contentment you can have when you make very little as long as the basics are there, a roof, water, food, and TV. Been there done that.<p>Seen it too in my professional life when I was doing work for a rent a cop place. I remember the amazement at the low pay that we paid a good many guards; being responsible for payroll programming it was a never ending struggle to make sure you had it all correct. Still the majority of them I met in my working career there were just fine, some thought it funny they could get paid to sit in a booth all day let alone be given a uniform.<p>The media needs truly mad people, politicians need them, and regardless of how well both segments try to create them they cannot even make people mad or storming the walls even with calls of racism.<p>Some of this has to do with the fact that people want to fix things and not burn it all down to do so. We have matured past that point, namely because even the poor have a lot to lose now. Old days if you were poor you might not have much more than what you were wearing so where was the value in that, today you might have a home, a nice phone, even a ratty car, but they are yours!<p>As for OWS, the reason it died out so fast DESPITE the &quot;intense&quot; media interest was because it was fake, unlike the Tea Party which in many areas is still as active as day one, OWS was manufactured, made for media, and not some ground swell of people who truly wanted to change things and put effort towards that.",1435255198

That is a prime example as to why I see all this as really sad. If one can&#x27;t handle the bullshit, perceived or real, slung out in public discourse then maybe one shouldn&#x27;t participate in the public discourse about that particular topic. Because most likely these are the type people who sling their own bullshit disguised as truth.<p>My memories of a debate, especially a scientific debate, was that both sides presented their best evidence to determine a likely winner.

The good thing about Javascript-based advertising tags is that you could kind of understand what was going on.<p>In the future, ads will be indistinguishable from content, and already shaky wall between editorial and advertising will collapse completely.<p>On top of that, the worst part of modern advertising - data sharing - will be completely unobservable to us. Even small publishers will maintain databases of a wealth of information about you, tied to your logged in email address.<p>3.

Both are abhorrent. But the latter is much worse.<p>Jefferson, unlike most confederate figures and institutions, also made important philosophical contributions to the founding ideology of our nation (besides slavery).

Snoop is not a dumb guy, and he has managed to remain relevant for his entire career -- no small feat considering the changes our society has undergone since he broke into the public eye in the early 90s. Even his copious marijuana usage is no longer as illegal as it once was (and let&#x27;s be real, half the CEOs in the valley smoke on the regular anyway).<p>Your CEO&#x27;s main job at a relatively mature company like Twitter is to set the tone for your brand, and Snoop is huge across the entire millennial set (aka Twitter&#x27;s target demographic).

While your primary job is involved with engineering or architecture, you have a technical role, but as CEO your role shifts to become primarily political and managerial. These roles do of course all blend together at smaller companies, but the spotlight appears certainly the moment you assume the mantle of CEO. You are right I don&#x27;t know the history by heart (certainly not as well as you do) but I think there&#x27;s an argument to be made that in most companies there is significantly less concern about the politics/personal beliefs of non-CEO employees than the appointed public face.<p>While I certainly agree the donation doesn&#x27;t fit the legal definition, I&#x27;d say it falls under a very sane definition of hate speech, at least in the context under which the proposition existed at the time and the movement it represented. Prop 8 was an initiative designed as a symbolic gesture by anti-gay (read: hate) activists to codify in law the explicit removal (&quot;re-removal&quot;, in the words of the judge who ruled on it) of rights from a marginalized group of people. Vocal support for it is hate speech. Monetary support is similar but more extreme. I don&#x27;t think this characterization is far off though I will admit it is unnecessarily incendiary because of the unintended conflation with the legal term. So I will give you this; it is a speech action, and it is hateful, but I shouldn&#x27;t have characterized it as hate speech.<p>And for many &quot;take your rights away&quot; exactly characterizes this initiative. Though in California domestic partnerships exist which give the same rights as a marriage, it&#x27;s codifying in law that a gay relationship is &#x27;less than&#x27; a straight relationship. Removing the actual rights associated with the partnership happens to be politically untenable in California, though it isn&#x27;t in many other states and so they have done exactly this; prop 8 was a symbolic gesture to many that said &quot;We can&#x27;t take your rights away much as we&#x27;d like to, but remember there are still a whole lot of anti-gay people in California&quot;.<p>And since writing my original post I learned more about the history of the incident, read your blog post on inclusiveness in response to the incident which I found very passionate and compelling and changed my mind; I am still vehemently opposed to prop 8 or any measure like it and I still think it&#x27;s a hateful and ugly thing to support, and that the public face of a company that supports inclusiveness has no business issuing public statements in favor of it, but I agree you were victimized by a crusade, the boycott was out of line and inappropriate, and have no problem with the appointment.<p>So many news stories pass us by and all we retain from them are snippets of blogspam or clickbait articles or comments on social media and we all get our own impressions of how things occurred, often times they are horribly distorted one-sided glimpses we have into the histories of actual events. I think in general people in this age, myself especially included, are too quick to condemn in situations they don&#x27;t fully understand so I apologize and I appreciate all the work you&#x27;ve done for Mozilla, and freedom and openness on the internet.",1435252587

Parts_, the internal book about Wasabi mentioned in the blog, on their website:<p><a href=""http://jacob.jkrall.net/wasabi-the-parts/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jacob.jkrall.net/wasabi-the-parts/index.html</a><p>Having now read it, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that the blog gives the wrong impression about the implications of having a custom language. Readers of the blog post come away with the idea that Wasabi was so full of &quot;o.O&quot; that someone was moved to write a book about that. In reality, the book is simply documentation of the language features, with callouts for weird interactions between VB-isms, ASP.NET-isms, and their language.<p>You should <i>definitely</i> read the &quot;Brief And Highly Inaccurate History Of Wasabi&quot; that leads the document off. It&#x27;s actually very easy now to see how they ended up with Wasabi:<p>1. The ASP->PHP conversion was extremely low-hanging fruit (the conversion involved almost no logic).<p>2. Postprocessing ASP meant PHP always lagged, so they started generating ASP from the same processor.<p>3. Now that all their FogBugz code hits the preprocessor, it makes sense to add convenience functions to it.<p>4. Microsoft deprecates ASP. FogBugz needs to target ASP.NET. They can manually port, or upgrade the preprocessor to do that for them. They choose the latter option: now they have their own language.<p>It&#x27;s step (3) where they irrevocably commit themselves to a new language. They want things like type inference and nicer loops and some of the kinds of things every Lisp programmer automatically reaches for macros to get. They have this preprocessor. So it&#x27;s easy to add those things. Now they&#x27;re not an ASP application anymore.<p>Quick rant: if this had been a Lisp project, and they&#x27;d accomplished this stuff by writing macros, we&#x27;d be talking this up as a case study for why Lisp is awesome. But instead because they started from unequivocally terrible languages and added the features with parsers and syntax trees and codegen, the whole project is heresy.

The answer seems to be:  the results can be really good!<p>There are several issues, though.<p>First, your gains will usually be in increased throughput rather than reduced latency.  And this is usually a tradeoff that requires greater consumption of memory bandwidth, as you&#x27;re loading data you don&#x27;t need.  If you are running on a single-core, this is usually a good tradeoff.  If you are already parallel on all cores, it may not be.<p>The second is that you need to be able to &quot;batch&quot; your requests.  That is, you need to be prefetching for the next request while you are handling the next level for the current request.  The shorter the final processing time once you have the answer, the larger your batches need to be.<p>The last is that each CPU has a limit on the number of outstanding requests for cachelines from RAM:  usually 10.  This limits the size of your batches in accordance with Little&#x27;s Law.   The question then becomes whether that batch size is possible, and how much benefit it provides.<p>But there is a sweet spot where you can get large gains (2-3x single processor throughput) if you have enough requests available, if you can tolerate a slightly slower response time, and if the processing required once you have a result is significant (comparable to memory latency).<p>Oh, and you also need to be willing to write the critical sections in assembly.  Even if you figure out the combination of fragile syntax and compiler optionss that produces the branch-free logic that you need, convincing an optimizing compiler to make your apparently unnecessary prefetches at exactly the point in time you need them to be is next to impossible.<p>This paper isn&#x27;t quite on this exact topic, but leans heavily in the same direction:<p>Rethinking SIMD Vectorization for In-Memory Databases\nOrestis Polychroniou, Arun Raghavan, Kenneth A Ross\n<a href=""http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orestis/sigmod15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~orestis/sigmod15.pdf</a>",1435251625

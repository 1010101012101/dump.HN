What different mechanism implements one-click shopping that isn't one-click shopping?<p>I'm serious. Lay it out for me. Then, if you manage to get that far, explain what your difference has that the B&N implementation didn't have. Don't just handwave.<p>""I haven't read the claims(and I'll bet that you haven't either)""<p>Wrong.<p>In fact...<p>""They're about disclosure...""<p>If you have any programming skills, you should go read the patent and see just how much is ""disclosed"". First, sit down and sketch out what you would need to implement in order to create a one-click ordering system. No, seriously, sketch out the basic systems on paper. Then go read the patent. Then boil out the legalese. Then observer that your sketch and what the patent contains has roughly the same amount of information.<p>You are at a disadvantage until you do this, by the way, because like I said, I <i>have</i> read this, and several other such patents. You need to read at least one before continuing on. And ask yourself the question, exactly how much help are these patent applications in implementing a solution to the given problem to one ""skilled in the art""? This is part of the reason software patents are so stupid, they almost all completely fail this test. You cited one of the handful of counterexamples already, but an exception it very much is.<p>""Patents have nothing to do with encouraging people to create alternative solutions.""<p>You need to brush up on your patent defenses if you're going to spend any time defending them. They're for the purposes of <i>promoting</i> innovation, and the stimulation of alternate solutions is one of the big ways they do this. It is only a recent perversion of the goals of IP that they are solely intended to serve as property and create gatekeepers and therefore allow people to <i>block</i> innovation as they see fit.",1305669593

Unfortunately, every institution is self-serving and self-preserving, so ostensibly-Communist states are inevitably unable to complete the self-destructive process.

It just doesn't happen unless the state feels threatened in some way, and the state is unable to destroy the threat.<p>A Communist state will relentlessly attack any non-hierarchical movement attempting to organize a classless egalitarian society, because such movements are a threat to the state's power.

Managers can't hire someone they already know to be a perfect fit for a particular job -- if HR decides (after a lengthy interview process) that the candidate didn't attend the right school, that's it. A lot of emotional and social capital gets spent as they approach people to ostensibly hire them, and along the way someone (who'll never actually work with the person post-hire) pulls the plug. A good number of manager-level people are pretty frustrated by it.<p>And they appear to have taken a chapter from Disney-CBS's book: if you ever turn down a job offer from them, your chances of getting another one--even if it's years down the road, and for a different job--are practically nonexistent. To some degree, I get that, but institutionally, they certainly seem to believe their own hype a bit too much.<p>Google's still reaping the rewards of having a ridiculously high-profit product (AdWords). Despite being publicly traded, nobody's ever expected them to behave like a 'regular company', and as long as Yahoo and Microsoft continue to play the Copy Google game, it'll stay that way.

This was actually for an internship, but for a PhD-seeking grad student who can code (me).<p>(1) I had a deadline to accept/deny with another company, and I told Google the deadline. Google asked me to get an extension, so they'd have more time to interview me. I got the extension (the other company wasn't delighted to give it to me, and I was embarassed to ask, but I did it anyway). I told Google. Then, Google never scheduled the interview for me, and I ended up just having to accept with the other company. I wrote Google to tell them I had accepted with the other company on that company's deadline, and they acknowledged my email, but did not offer an apology or explanation for making me get an extension and then not actually scheduling an interview.<p>(2) The process they used for me and my colleagues (grad students) was to have PhD engineers interview us as an initial filter, then to have HR people actually place us in groups. This placement process seemed pretty abysmal, for me and for everyone else. Which isn't surprising. The HR people aren't qualified to understand a student's area of research, expertise, and interest, and match them to groups. I would imagine their level of insight, as non-hackers, is basically ""This student like Python, this group needs Python."" In order to do this right, they need people who can actually <i>understand</i> the students' research and skills and the groups' needs at a much more fine-grained level.<p>(3) The sort-of-rudeness I experienced with HR described in #1 happened to more of my colleagues than not (in various forms). Honestly, I wonder if the HR people are just super over-worked.<p>Anyway, not long after this Google very publicly announced that Sergey was taking over as CEO and shaking things up to try to return the company to its roots. I was surprised by how ""un-Googly"" the whole recruiting process was, and I guess the company has really been struggling to maintain its culture across the board. I consider the experiences I described above to be one likely symptom/manifestation of this.<p>Overall I'd say I saw a combination of big company bureaucracy problems, with a ""holier-than-thou"" pretentious attitude that seems to allow rudeness to creep in. Their attitude is, ""We know you'd die to work for us,"" which is just so untrue, and it'll be very hard for them to ever recruit me in the future after this experience.<p>Maybe Google has gone from ""Don't be evil"" to ""Evil, but unlike other companies, we still act like can can do no wrong.""",1305667336

US dollars have no intrinsic worth, but I know that if you give me some, I can give them to someone else in exchange for something I want, and therefore I am willing to accept them in exchange for my labor. The only value in the dollar you give me is the fact that I can give it back to you later in exchange for something I actually want - but what makes it actual currency, and not just an IOU, is the fact that I can give it to anyone else in a dollar market in exchange for something I want.<p>Part of what makes this work is our mutual knowledge that it would be very hard for either of us to game the system. I can't just print up new dollars and neither can you; this means that the dollars you give me are very likely to have been given to you by someone else, which makes it very likely that I will be able to pass them on to someone else, which makes them useful and therefore valuable. If I could just print up my own dollars out of thin air, I wouldn't actually need to do any work to acquire them, which would make me less likely to accept them in trade for whatever it is you want from me; if everyone else is in the same position, then none of us have any reason to accept dollars from each other, and the currency is no longer useful as a means for exchanging debts. So the usefulness of any currency depends on the degree to which it is difficult to create new currency units.<p>This is what I mean by confidence that bitcoins are going to remain valuable: people can't just pull them out of thin air. It takes a lot of work to get a bitcoin. Right now the bitcoin system is new so lots of people are mining bitcoins, but once there are enough of them it will be easier to get a bitcoin by doing some other kind of work than by mining. This is all we need for bitcoins to become a useful medium of exchange for IOUs, should we decide to use it that way.",1305667163

They do not share databases. They do not share implementations. They do not share architectures.<p>So?  The patent is on a mechanism for one click shopping.  Like all patents, the mechanism is described as abstractly as possible while avoiding prior art.  (The doctrine of equivalents is settled law wrt every other kind of patent.  Why do you think that it shouldn't apply to software?)<p>Implement one-click shopping with a different mechanism and the patent doesn't apply.  The patent also doesn't cover using one click for anything else.<p>> In each case I guarantee the relevant code in both implementations is orders of magnitude larger than the patent itself, which by simple information theory means that the patent is only a small part of the whole.<p>You write that like it's important - it isn't, at least not wrt any other kind of patent.  Why should software be different?<p>> They have a patent on the idea of One-Click shopping.<p>You seem to think that patenting an idea is somehow wrong.  Since every patent covers an idea ....<p>> There apparently exists no alternate implementation of One-Click shopping that will not violate the patent, because by any remotely sensible standard that would permit such an alternate implementation, Barnes and Noble must be able to meet it.<p>I haven't read the claims (and I'll bet that you haven't either), so I can't say whether it covers every possible implementation, but even if it did, so what?  That's the goal of every other patent as well.  Why should software be different?<p>I suspect that you also think that ""the abstract mechanism is obvious if you're trying to do one-click shopping"" is meaningful - it isn't.  In every other domain, novelty can come from asking a new question, such as ""wouldn't one-click shopping be a good idea?""  Again - why should software be different.<p>> Patents are supposed to encourage innovation by enticing people to create their own alternate solutions, but in software, and more or less only in software, you can patent ideas.<p>The above is wrong on almost every detail.<p>Patents have nothing to do with encouraging people to create alternative solutions.  They're about disclosure and blocking free-riders.  And, as I wrote above, every patent is an idea patent.",1305666358

A friend of mine who is a professor uses what he calls the sandwich theory of essay criticism: Say something nice. Say the critical stuff. Say something nice. The tough and bitter meat is in the middle, and the bread makes it palatable. Ive just taken over a peer-review essay site and added a feature (expert reviews) that has come to dominate what the site does. Although the reviews we have started offering are not scathing, they are detailed and very critical. My hope, of course, is that they are very useful, but some students who submit essays for review will find their writing dissected and examined to an extent they have never experienced before. And its in public. I expect that it may for some be an overwhelming or even harrowing experience, and reading this post and the comments makes me appreciative of the courage of those who submit their essays for such criticism.",1305666329

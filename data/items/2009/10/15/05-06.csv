882878,comment,882720,882823,0,0,andymoe,,,"Even SharePoint services built into server 2003/2008 is pretty usable out of the box. You can spend a few hours to a few days to get it configured depending how much tweaking you do (and how screwed up your servers and environment are already :-p). The newer version has pretty tight integration with office. It beats throwing everything in public folders since they are less flexible and harder to manage. It also beats people emailing big files around saying ""Here, print this 20MB PowerPoint for me.""<p>If you have a few offices or remote users it is really useful. Probably not even worth considering for less than 15 people and only if you have some existing infrastructure. For smaller teams a hosted solution or some of the other products mentioned might be a better fit. (123together.com and intermedia both are OK for hosted SharePoint/exchange etc) Also, the blog and wiki stuff is still sub-par but the check-in check out stuff for documents does work pretty well.",1255586094

And even with that cost, there's the question of how much overlapping content actually makes something a ""dupe"".  Overlapping subjects?<p>Crowdsourcing gets into merging comment threads and system gaming..  and the end result is still that one URL (probably from the most popular, ""trusted"" source) ends up on the front page anyhow.<p>So.. lots of messy boring work and higher server expenses, for .. ?<p>I'd call it good enough, myself",1255585976

882868,comment,882428,882428,0,0,solutionyogi,,,"What's up with all the MS hate? This thread reads like a Slashdot thread and not an HN thread. Pardon me, I feel that the OP is not sincere. He already has a preconceived notion (OP quote, 'it seems to be pretty crappy and hard to explain') about the  product and wants to reinforce it.<p>Sharepoint is first and foremost, a document management platform. Ever worked in a company where important documents are kept on a network share? Sharepoint can replace those network shares, provide web based access to all shared company documents. It also supports versioning and users can checkout/check in documents from within the Office application. E.g. if I open a Word document from Office and start editing it, it will be checked out and when I save it, it will check in those changes. It is completely transparent (you really have to try it to appreciate the seamless way it works) and non technical users don't even notice it. In fact, dare I say that Sharepoint has successfully solved the 'checkout/check in' problem for non-technical users.<p>Sharepoint offers wiki/group calendar as others have mentioned.<p>Sharepoint offers something similar to Google Spreadsheet where multiple users can update a web based spreadsheet simultaneously.<p>Sharepoint is also a collaboration platform where you can plugin your custom code to customize the Sharepoint portal. In fact, at my last company, a Fortune 100 company BTW, they customized Sharepoint and used it as an Intranet. The Intranet was a huge improvement compared to the existing manually maintained site they had. I think they developed the Intranet in around 3.5 months using 2 developers which is very impressive. The best part is that if you know .NET framework and ASP.NET, you only need to learn a little bit before you can start customizing the portal.<p>Name me a single product which provides seamless integration with Office applications, versioning, wiki, group calendar and above all a platform on which you can build on to streamline your processes. Additionally, it's easy to find Sharepoint developers OR train your existing staff to learn and modify it as it uses .NET/ASP.NET framework. For a company which already uses Windows platform, I think Sharepoint is a complete no-brainer.<p>If you have further questions, ask away.",1255585698

882859,comment,882707,882735,0,0,philk,,,"I'm unsure of the advantages you describe in your second paragraph:<p>1) Seasonal isn't an advantage; I'd much rather be able to enjoy broccoli (or whatever) all year round rather than have to make do with it for a quarter of the year.<p>2) Local food doesn't have a lower environmental impact.  The argument made is that food isn't being transported as far, hence their is less fuel burned in delivering it.  However, the energy cost of moving food around - in trucks and on container ships, is remarkably low compared with the other costs in growing food.  Much more energy is expended getting the food home to the consumer than getting it to the store, regardless of where it came from.  As people often travel further to get to farmers markets than supermarkets (not to mention getting food home delivered) this causes local food to have a bigger environmental footprint.<p>3) I dont' have a problem with any of the other things in my life being ""arbitrated by huge multinational corporations"", so I'm unsure why I should care when it comes to food.  As long as the ""huge multinational corporations"" aren't large enough to form a monopoly (or oligopoly) I'm not disadvantaged.<p>4) I don't want a relationship with my food supplier beyond them giving me food and me giving them money as I don't really have time for this - and if I had the free time I'd rather spend it on something else.<p>5) Traceability is a good thing, however large companies are making progress in achieving this through RFID.  Systems which make use of this have been in place for a while on some products, for example meat in Japan.<p>6) I've had food from farmers markets and from organic suppliers.  In both cases I heard people promote the food as 'tasting better', however I found it tasted the same in the former case and worse in the latter.  I suspect that this is more a psychological effect, if you're ponying up twice the cash for bananas you might experience them as tasting better.  Taste is, after all, subjsective.<p>7) Finally, your post seems to be predicated upon the idea that corporations are evil (TM) while small farmers are honest salt-of-the-earth types.  Neither is true.",1255585360

1750436,comment,1750160,1750414,0,0,antirez,,,"> Redis works great as long as the dataset fits in RAM<p>This is by design, companies moving away from Redis because of this did not understood the deal at the beginning, and where looking for something else, so it was a good idea to move away.<p>Redis is mostly an in-memory database that happens to be disk-backed. With VM it is a different issue, and there are interesting VM uses, but the vast majority of Redis users are using the DB without VM, and as it is, as an in memory store, where the disk dump is used in order to reload the data on startup.<p>Because this is the Redis way, even developments are focused towards this direction: to use less memory for common data types, and scalable clustering in order to make it simple to use multiple instances.<p>I see this as a very simple to gasp thing. Just because this is the argument of the discussion instead I fail to see why Mongo should instead not be just considered as an SQL-family DB. It seems more or less a subset of SQL, but implemented with different tradeoffs. For sure they have some good motivations to avoid SQL, but what I mean is that <i>semantically</i> it looks a relational database, while Redis has a completely different data model, so I can't see how the two systems really are a reciprocal drop in replacement and/or comparable solutions.<p>So I can see how MongoDB can be an alternative to MySQL when used to store a lot (much larger than memory) of row-alike data (call it documents or like you want).<p>And I can see how Redis can be used when you have memory fitting databases and need very high performances, and in general for all the needs of atomic data structures and complex server-side operations in this data structures. For instance storing or caching timelines, taking leader boards for a game via sorted sets, and a zillion other use cases that are currently running while we are talking.<p>I can't see instead how MongoDB can replace Redis or the other way around, if not for a very small subset of cases.",1286027703

1750417,comment,1749644,1749952,0,0,zephyrfalcon,,,"I moved from the Netherlands to the US nine years ago, and one of the big differences I noticed was the almost complete lack of bicycles on the roads. Not just that, but also the way bikes are used (or not used).<p>Where I'm from, there are many places with crowded traffic (not just in the bigger cities) and many, many bikes. It's common for kids to ride their bike to school, for example. There is such a thing as a ""traffic test"" for kids riding bikes, although I'm not sure if all schools do this. As for motorists, driving lessons are mandatory, and some of the things you learn are meant to protect cyclists: if your car has to take a right turn, you have to stop and look in your mirrors and over your right shoulder to check if there's no bikes coming (because they have the right of way!), and when you park you don't just slam open your car door, you look for bikes and other traffic first. (Failing to do so during the (non-trivial) drivers exam will likely earn you a failing grade.)<p>The Dutch have a lot of crazy traffic rules, but some of them actually make sense. :-) This why there are relatively few accidents with bikes, people accept them as part of the regular traffic, and cyclists don't need to wear helmets. (They do need reflectors so they can more easily be seen at night.)<p>So, coming from this, when you then move to the US, your first reaction might well be, ""why don't people ride their bikes (to school, work, etc)?"" One of the reasons is that it's just not a very common or safe way of transportation around here (at least in most areas -- I don't know about downtown SF or something).",1286027147

If you look at game design, incremental variable rewards are one of the most addictive possible things. Incremental means you unlock them gradually, and variable means you don't always get the same thing. That's why getting an awesome item in Diablo II was always more addictive than getting an awesome item in Baldur's Gate. In Diablo, you never knew what you were going to get and how valuable it'd be. In Baldur's Gate, the Hammer +3 was always with this guy, the dagger +2 was always buried down in the southeast tomb, etc.<p>Mixing variable and incremental rewards does increase addiction, which can be positive or negative. It's positive if you're harnessing it.<p>I think this could definitely work for teaching people things - one of the ways I learned how to type really fast was playing a text-based player vs. player game way back in the day. Getting semi-unrelated rewards (like you said next track, toughest unlocked, stump the teacher, or more commonly badges, ranks, points, etc) can be a massive boon to learning something. There's also the ""head fake"" element of teaching while not looking like you're teaching, which I got from Randy Pausch's Last Lecture (highly, highly recommended if you haven't seen it).<p>With all that said, I haven't found quite the right way to harness it in my own life. A lot of the tracking I do gives me a way to get numbers and feel good, but assigning myself badges or points seemed like a little more trouble than it's worth.

The bloat, the fear of upgrades breaking things (this is why my main home file server still runs 8.04, something I'm not happy about) if you have a slightly nonstandard install. I switched to Arch for my main home laptop and breathed new life into a PIII-850 with 128mb of RAM. Ubuntu would've killed it.<p>In a bizarre twist of fate, work requirements meant having to use Windows Vista (the horror!) then 7, where so far the best feature seems to be ""It's not vista"", so no more Ubuntu at work for me, except through VMs.<p>Still, Ubuntu did a heck of a lot to make Linux easier for the masses, and I have to say thanks to all those at Canonical and the Ubuntu community that made it possible.",1286024798

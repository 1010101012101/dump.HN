That said, it was crass of Amazon to invoke Orwell in the first place. They referenced him largely of context, cherry picked a quote, and dredged him up primarily for the emotional connotations of his name. Someone was going to call them out on it.<p>Because &quot;1984&quot; is the first and only thing 99% of people know about George Orwell, bringing his name into a discussion has long been the literary equivalent of <i>reductio ad Hitlerum</i>. &quot;Even George Orwell said...,&quot; or &quot;George Orwell himself wrote...&quot; are often the hallmarks of lazy and facile arguments. Amazon&#x27;s Orwell reference was similarly lame.<p>I have no love for Hachette in this battle. At the same time, I don&#x27;t find Amazon to be a wholly likable or compelling protagonist. Its PR strategies have been hamfisted, ceding a lot of moral appeal to Hachette that Hachette has not earned and does not deserve.<p>That this whole thing plays out, day by day, in a paper of record like the NYT is a consequence of the NYT&#x27;s close orbit to the publishing world. Many of its writers are represented by the same agencies that rep Hachette&#x27;s writers, and some are probably Hachette writers themselves.",1407603240

Traffic is just not predictable, and since buses follow a defined route, they have an even worse time of it than the average driver (who only goes from point A to B, with flexible routing)<p>This is equally true whether you use rail or bus.  A bus system on dedicated busways can be just as fast and reliable as a traditional subway.  A rail system running at-grade in traffic will suffer the same low ridership and stigmatization as a regular bus line.<p>Advantages to buses on dedicated busways: They&#x27;re slightly cheaper than rail development.<p>Advantages to rail on dedicated railways: Much greater capacity than a bus system.

When someone tells me &quot;1 foot long&quot; I expect exactly 12 standardized inches- not something roughly as big as my foot (even though, in my case, my foot is almost exactly 12 inches).<p>In modern times when we want a more organic measure we find ourselves dropping standard units (whether metric or imperial) and using random analogous items instead- like number of empire-state-buildings or 10-paces then turn left, or (more often perhaps but slightly different)- about 3 blocks away.<p>The moment people started caring about whether it was Henry I&#x27;s nose-to-thumb length or some multiple of grains of barley dry it stopped mattering. I&#x27;m very average sized and my pace is almost exactly one yard per step (or, as you pointed out, more or less a meter as well). I would be fine using the term &#x27;yard&#x27; in the intuitive or organic sense- but when you&#x27;re using it to tell me exactly where my property line is I suddenly need precision, agreed on standards, and at that point the question of inches vs centimeters is strictly a question of familiarity (or I suppose, as the article mentions, politics).",1407602365

I am not limited by price to the number of books I can consume each month; I am limited by time.  Already many readers end up buying more books than they can read. In addition, free books are available at this place called the library.<p>Music, movies, and the rest of digital content is not like this. You can pick up a video game and play it for an hour, then put it down.

Good books require lots of time and change the reader forever.<p>So what Amazon is effectively doing is destroying the concept of reading by making it nothing more than an extended version of an mp3 song. But since you can&#x27;t just consume a book in 3 minutes, more books will be sold and more books will remain unread. Books -- long form content -- will become superfluous. It&#x27;s all low attention span, immediate pleasure consumption now. I imagine we&#x27;ll see more and more readers buy an ebook and read a few pages and stop. The nature of reading will change.<p>And while this might result in more <i>overall</i> book sales, it doesn&#x27;t do much for the individual relationship an author has with a particular reader.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with making books like every other form of digital content. Everything is bits, and bits gotta be free. But as a consumer of good books, Amazon does not have my best interests at heart. It&#x27;s just playing a numbers game. My best interests actually might be books that cost 100x what they currently do: make me feel some pain and spend some careful thought about what I&#x27;m going to spend my time on.<p>I am not interested in delivering the maximum number of unread ebooks to the most number of non-readers. I am interested in choosing those 5 or 6 books each year that are worth my investment in time to experience. And as an author, I am not interested in maximizing sales. I am interested in maximizing <i>impact</i>. Amazon is friend to neither of us.",1407602180

This isn&#x27;t disruption comparable to Uber or AirBnB, it isn&#x27;t disruption at all. The examples you give are all companies which have come along and provided an offering on par with or exceeding what is currently being offered by archaic slow moving industries, often both in price and experience.<p>Uber works because the service you receive is a commodity service - transport. Uber fixes the price across all car tier&#x27;s so it doesn&#x27;t matter wether you get Larry or Jim, you&#x27;re paying the same, their job is to get you from point A to point B. There&#x27;s essentially no qualitative differentiation. What they offer isn&#x27;t cheaper than a cab but the experience they offer is arguably superior and more convenient. This works and is disruptive. What AirBnB offer is a platform to connect people with spare beds, with people who want a place to stay. The qualitative offering differs from host to host, and as a result, AirBnB allow Hosts to set their own price per night, so essentially making AirBnB a platform conecting people, but allowing a free market to operate upon it. The end experience is unique, and mostly cheaper than the equivalent experience at a hotel. This works, this is disruptive.<p>What Fiverr are doing is offering a highly inferior service at a much lower price. They are taking a service which is not a commodity good,  one with a huge spectrum of qualitative differentiation, and fixing it at a very low price. When you do that you just get a bad product bought cheap. That is not new, let alone disruptive.<p>The differentiator between Fiverr design product and a good quality professional designer, isn&#x27;t that they don&#x27;t offer the &#x27;bells and whistles&#x27;. A &#x27;professional&#x27;, reputable designer isn&#x27;t trying to upsell you on the scotch guard for your sofa to make an extra buck or two - pantone references and vector artwork aren&#x27;t line items on an invoice in design, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re paying for. The gap is the quality of the final product. This isn&#x27;t people offering high quality design and somehow making it a leaner, more compelling offering than traditional channels using some kind of an innovative model - this is just poor quality work pedalled on a platform.<p>Not everyone is prepared to pay for &#x27;good&#x27; design. Some people just want &#x27;something&#x27;. And there will always be those people.  That both want just something, and those that produce it. That pool of people, and the rest, which need, and understand the value of good design aren&#x27;t in conflict. They&#x27;re totally separate groups, and they&#x27;ve co existed for years, and will continue to.<p>I can confidently say that Fiverr will not make me, or any designers I know &#x27;think about the way we sell our services&#x27; in the manner you suggest.",1407601840

In general, I would not trust anything these authors put out without fact-checking all their claims and actually reading the studies they cite. I have found that they are rather, uh, flexible with their facts: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7889290"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7889290</a><p>2. They claim they could find no evidence supporting a relation between patenting and innovation growth, only a relation between patenting and increased patenting. This is false - there are many studies showing positive correlation between patenting and measures of innovation other than patenting, such as R&D expenditure, and diversity of industries in which innovation happens. Just from a quick search:<p><a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1513814"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1513814</a><p><a href=""http://nw08.american.edu/~wgp/park_lippoldt08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nw08.american.edu/~wgp/park_lippoldt08.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.dklevine.com/archive/sokoloff-kahn.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dklevine.com/archive/sokoloff-kahn.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003043048.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003043048.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.nber.org/books_in_progress/invention/chapter7.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/books_in_progress/invention/chapter7.pdf</a><p><a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/h0042.pdf?new_window=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/h0042.pdf?new_window=1</a><p>Heck, patenting is also positively correlated with increased prosperity in general:<p><a href=""http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2013/02/patenting%20prosperity%20rothwell/patenting%20prosperity%20rothwell.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/reports/2013...</a><p>3. The bit about the correlation of patenting and productivity growth is also incorrect, and is actually  something of a strawman. The theory is innovation results in increased productivity, and patenting is a proxy for innovation, but the relation between innovation and productivity is ambiguous and difficult to quantify:<p><a href=""http://www2.itif.org/2013-competitiveness-innovation-productivity-clearing-up-confusion.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www2.itif.org/2013-competitiveness-innovation-product...</a><p><a href=""http://elsa.berkeley.edu/pub/users/bhhall/papers/BHH11_Innovation_Productivity_NEPR.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elsa.berkeley.edu/pub/users/bhhall/papers/BHH11_Innov...</a>)<p>But even then, a quick Google suggests that there <i>is</i> evidence of patenting and increased productivity: <a href=""http://cep.lse.ac.uk/people/bloom/BloomVanReenen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cep.lse.ac.uk/people/bloom/BloomVanReenen.pdf</a><p>The authors certainly are aware of Google, so I&#x27;m guessing they simply decided to cherrypick studies that support their point of view.<p>4.

2002311,comment,2000660,2001417,0,0,TheCondor,,,"The complexity of software changes the equation dramatically..  When you buy a piece of software, outside of games and certain embedded apps, you're typically investing in the longer term life of the product.  You expect the owners to update, fix and enhance the product.   Free software takes that to the extreme, you pay for support and nothing else.   There might be some other exceptions but whether or not it's a conscious part of the decision you sort of expect it.  The SaaS model also takes it to the extreme,  there are often some other value-adds for doing things in the cloud but a big one is they are constantly improving your apps.    Back in the day there were more efforts to fight piracy and there were copy protection schemes and all that ilk.<p>Books and music	are in kind of a funny space,  the costs of production have fallen through the floor; you can literally buy a computer and some fairly in-expensive equipment and record good quality recording.  If you have a little more money you can do a completely professional top of the line recording..  Second, the industry is completely built around selling a finished commodity, you buy the book or the CD and it's done, there is no more business.  Third that comodity is very easy to pirate.  With music it seems like they could put concert tickets in with the CD or coupons to get them more cheaply or buy other merchendise,  that caters to a fairly small market though.  Some other sort of value-add that justifies the expense seem like the only options with the industry as it is.  Maybe they could not distribute recordings and make a subscription radio service that played the content exclusively  (that seems lame though,  but people didn't like the idea of SaaS or pay per cycle in the old days either)<p>Personally, I bought the pick-axe book a handful of years back, read it, did some stuff, put it	on the shelf.   Then the 2nd edition came out, I bought it, unfortunately life and other things got in the way of that one so it just sat on the shelf.  Now there is a 3rd edition..  I'd have paid maybe $15 more the first time around if I got some free upgrades,   I'd have probably paid $15 more the first time AND paid $5-10 for an upgrade when it came out.  The $40 or $45 each time though....   It doesn't feel like you get that much.  I'm not going to pirate it but I can't say that I don't see why people would.",1292281199

2002270,comment,2001177,2001177,0,0,kragen,,,"Chas Emerick might be right, but my experience is very different.<p>I moved to Silicon Valley in 1996 to take a job as a sysadmin. My previous job: bottling bubblebath in a bubblebath factory in Ohio. I managed to stay in that job for the year it took to pay off my moving expenses, which is a testament to the fact that I already knew some stuff, and moved back to Dayton, Ohio, to be with my wife.<p>BAD MOVE. Ended up working at Keane on a Y2K remediation project, wrote a Perl script that allowed us to do a text-scanning task in an hour that previously took days with the Keane Assessment Tool (written in COBOL), got reprimanded in writing for suggesting to a customer contact that we remove some unused and incorrect code from their software, was yanked off the client site and sent to their management training course where I was indoctrinated in their explicitly-described-as-waterfall methodology, and was fired at the end of my three-month probationary period.<p>At this point, Keane, despite making nearly a billion dollars a year writing software to automate its customers' business processes, had a timesheet process that worked as follows:<p>1. Download the Excel spreadsheet from the Keane website onto the client computer and fill in your hours.<p>2. Print it out on the client's printer.<p>3. Fax it to the Keane office on the client's fax machine.<p>4. At the Keane office, the receptionist would type the hours from the printed, faxed spreadsheet into the timesheet system, which I never saw.<p>From later 1997 to 2000 in Dayton, I worked at ERIM, a government contractor developing software for hyperspectral image analysis.  The level of competency was higher there than at Keane, but essentially the project was to reimplement in C++ a bunch of algorithms that were already implemented in ERDAS Imagine, with the stated objective of improving their usability, but with no human-factors people on the team.  The real objective was to get the taxpayers to foot the bill for a reimplementation of these algorithms whose copyright would be held by the prime contractor, Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation.<p>At one point, our team lead (Teresa Cloud, of BATC) declared a policy against using the C++ keyword ""this"", because she thought it was bad style. On another occasion, I got reprimanded for using ""assert"" statements in my code — not for creating the bug that triggered the assertion failures, which was also my fault, you understand, but for the statements that detected it. As you can tell from these stories, my technical and political savvy was quite limited at the time, and my productivity was even worse.<p>During this time, you understand, I was hanging out in bookstores, talking to people there, taking classes at WSU, going to Linux user groups and the Dayton Microcomputer Association and Hamvention and Computerfest, occasionally doing volunteer work with a computers-for-the-poor project whose name I forget now.  There are probably a dozen or more interesting high-tech companies there in Dayton, but I never succeeded in finding them.<p>In 2000, I took a job at a startup in Seattle. It challenged me like nothing ever had. After three months I visited Dayton, and I was astonished to find that nothing had changed. It was like visiting Brigadoon. Time just moved so much slower there.<p>When Kleiner funded us late that year, we moved to the SFBA, and I spent the next six years working for a variety of interesting tech companies, in the SFBA.  In 2006, I moved to Buenos Aires, and although there's some interesting stuff going on here, it's a pale shadow of the SFBA, despite having about the same total population.  The free software and contact improv communities here, however, are amazing.  But the environment does encourage me to get lazy and slow down instead of staying ahead of stuff.",1292280233

Why not try to actually directly answer the question at hand: name <i>one good or service</i> that is less available now than it was 20-30 years ago, thereby establishing an actual decrease in purchasing power for the consumers you claim are being ""starved"".",1292280225

If you make a habit of this, you'll probably get caught. If you download a song illegally for free, you can listen to it for the rest of your life unless you lose or delete the copy you have.<p>b) the exclusion of another passenger in any case only becomes significant when the train is full. If the train is half-empty, you're riding for free but nobody else is worse off because there's an abundance of seats. Of course you have a tiny negative effect on the fuel consumption of the vehicle, but that's much less important than the principle.<p>c) In any case, when you ride without a fare your offense is against the train operator. You don't get sued/prosecuted by the passengers who had to wait for the next train. The issue is not whether or not there was a seat available to someone else, but whether or not the service provider received the due cost of the ride/song/whatever, which cost is levied for market availability rather than for availability to an individual buyer standing in line behind you.<p>Now I quite agree with you that there are so many economic incentives in favor of digital piracy and such perverse incentives for the publishers' preferred way of doing business, that something has got to give and that's why we're seeing such upheaval in the media industry.

Danielle did make the statement that Twilio could not, and would not, catch up with Tropo on features. Instead, Twilio would focus on simplicity for the broad web developer community.<p>I respect Danielle and Twilio for making this statement at the time. As it is clear today that Twilio has a wide gap with Tropo on features. Twilio's focus on their core strength, simplicity, was smart. 37Signals has pioneered the idea of less is more with great success (albeit with an eye to staying private without VC funding).<p>The issue is, I think Twilio has come to the realization that to compete in this space they need more depth of capability. Further, the ITExpo statement was made before Twilio received their latest round of funding. They may very well have changed strategy and now regret having made this statement.<p>It is much easier to close the gap on simplicity than it is a wide feature gap. We are working regularly to make Tropo simpler, while maintaining its deep feature set. We are built on a platform, PRISM, that allows us to focus on the platform features rather than internals allowing us to innovate rapidly.<p>A Twilio individual confirmed at CloudCamp QCon in San Francisco that they are working to replace Asterisk (<a href=""http://asterisk.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asterisk.org</a>) as their key telephony engine. Further evidence of this is that Twilio, for the first time, is working hard to hire telephony experts. Whereas previously they were proud that they did not have telephony experts in-house and would actually plug this as a benefit.<p>It will continue to be hard for Twilio to catch-up to Tropo, given that they are having to spend time replacing the core fabric that they built their platform on. I suspect that they are most likely targeting Freeswitch (<a href=""http://freeswitch.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://freeswitch.org</a>) since Asterisk SCF (<a href=""http://www.asterisk.org/asterisk/scf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asterisk.org/asterisk/scf</a>) is still a nascent project.

[earlier cases] added this “different device” requirement to the statutory text to avoid what those judges thought would otherwise be a rule that made ordinary usage of a telephone or computer criminal. These judges feared that, unless the “device” must be extraneous to a proper communication, a person answering his own phone at home, and holding a conversation with a friend, would violate the Wiretap Act by acquiring the content of his own conversation using his own phone (a “device”).<p>This fear just shows why </i>it is a mistake to read snippets of a statute in isolation. <i>For another section of the Wiretap Act declares that “it shall not be unlawful ... for a person ... to intercept a wire, oral or electronic communication where such person is a party to the ommunication or where one of the parties ... has given prior consent.” [] So acquiring the contents of one’s own conversation, and sharing them over a speakerphone, is not unlawful, no matter what the word “device” means. It is better to follow the statute than to make up limitations to avert imaginary problems.</i><p>It would save a great deal of time and effort if this point made by Judge Easterbrook were more widely appreciated.<p>So many people think the law is like a series of logical assertions, and that if they can just find one error or inconsistency therein then the whole is invalidated, somewhat like a mathematical theorem or a piece of procedural computer code. Of course the law many flaws, but as a decision-making tool it's an event-driven, object-oriented, and employs a high degree of parallelism.",1292278691

There's a hacker space open and another being planned, startups sharing offices and the general buzz of stuff happening. The networking opportunities are absolutely immense - in any given week you could meet the founders of two dozen startups, easily.<p>What do you think my odds are of getting a great job in each city?<p>OP is wrong, absolutely dead wrong. Yes, there are opportunities outside of major cities, but they're much fewer and further between. There's an argument that competition is less fierce outside of metropolitan areas, but it's a bad argument for two reasons. First, it smacks of a poverty of ambition, a ""good enough"" attitude that no young developer should sink to. The other is that it isn't true. There is absolutely massive demand for good developers. Recession or not, most firms are desperate for people who really can write software.<p>While I'm sure you <i>can</i> build a good career in software anywhere, it's going to be an uphill struggle if you're not surrounded by people who are doing the same.

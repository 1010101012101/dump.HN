People kept telling me to save and invest, but I wanted to see empirically why this is true.<p>Features I&#x27;d like to add:<p><pre><code>  - Better taxation rules\n  - Specific asset classes and investment accounts with \n    associated taxation, withdraw limits, and contribution limits\n  - Investment allocation strategy with a changing risk profile \n    and tax conscious account allocation\n  - Social security income\n  - Highlighting the &quot;important&quot; factors \n    (i.e., the ones that impact the plot the most)\n  - A probabilistic simulation to get a better result estimate \n    (i.e., confidence intervals)\n</code></pre>\nIf you want to contribute, that&#x27;d be awesome! You can also easily fork it. If you have questions, I&#x27;m happy to answer them here!",1448240363

It&#x27;s surprising how good sending randomly picked strings works if the other side doesn&#x27;t suspect it, though being in script author&#x27;s shoes, I&#x27;d add some variation - i.e. I&#x27;d repeat every reason in the array several times with different punctuation, or even do something like: &quot;$RANDOM_ILL_BE_LATE, $RANDOM_REASON $RANDOM_SMILE $RANDOM_ENDING_PHRASE $RANDOM_EMOTICON.&quot; You get a combinatorial explosion of possible message strings, making it less likely the recipient will figure out it&#x27;s scripted.<p>A different thing I actually semi-scripted once was starting random small-talk with people over IM (back when I was younger). I just never could get myself to write &quot;hey, what&#x27;s up?&quot; to someone and many people thus thought I&#x27;m cold to them, or something. So in order to keep my relations with people from college friendly, I basically listed everyone I had contact with, assigned them some calendar reminder periods of time depending on how much I cared about the relationship, and obliged myself to chat up a person if their &quot;date&quot; came up in my morning reminders. The periods of time were picked up to be not divisible by 7, 29, 30 and 31, so that over time they&#x27;d land on different days of the month and the week. The messages I wrote myself; only the reminders were the &quot;scripted&quot; part.<p>I used this system for some time. End results:<p>a) it helped me maintain some relationships<p>b) it did not help me develop a chit-chatting habit, but it did lower my inhibition to initiating conversations<p>c) eventually me and most of my friends graduated and now no-one is chatting up anyone just to ask how they are...",1448240126

You just disqualified yourself from discussing this topic and be taken seriously imo. Inflation is a monetary phenomena. There is more to it than just money printing, but an excess amount of cash/liquidity in markets is what causes inflation. The velocity of money is also important. Seriously, there&#x27;s even an equation for this and none of it involves whatever you just said.<p>This is something that every major school of economics, both left and right agree upon since the 1960s (and it has roots way before then.)

That&#x27;s a really really really bad translation for not-kosher. It has nothing whatsoever to do with cleanliness.<p>Anyway for the purposes of this meat neither of those two options cover the topic.<p>The animal itself is what is kosher or not kosher. It has physical signs and those decide if it&#x27;s kosher or not.<p>There is a second issue that something derived from something non-kosher is also not kosher.<p>So CO2 (for seltzer) from beer is not kosher for passover, but CO2 from combustion is, despite both being identical.<p>But, there is a concept of nullified, i.e. diluted. If someone non-kosher is unintentionally diluted in something kosher at a 1/60 level it becomes nullified and ignored. (So CO2 from the atmosphere is fine for passover even if it originally was from beer.)<p>Except, if that diluted item is considered &quot;primary&quot;, i.e. it&#x27;s something that even at a 1/60th level becomes important in the final product.<p>So here we have a single cell from an animal - it certainly is less than 1/60th of the final product, but since it is primary to that product, which could not exist without it, that single cell can not be diluted.<p>i.e. you have to start with a kosher cell.<p>A much more complicated question is if it&#x27;s considered meat with regard to mixing meat and dairy. But the question is academic only since it would be rabbinically considered like meat because it looks like meat and you should not create a misleading situation.<p>And from the length of this reply you can start to understand why Judaism is such an academic and logically oriented religion with such an enormous quantity of scholarly books. You start with God-given unprovable axioms and generate everything else with logic, one item building upon the next, all ultimately sourced from the Torah (but you need some serious knowledge to be able to trace each law).

In that kind of environment, you can&#x27;t really run a local version of the system. if you&#x27;re lucky there&#x27;s a prod, qa, and development version. the development version is shared by everybody.<p>What winds up happening is the dev system has lots of in-progress stuff, and i can&#x27;t release my stuff till the other in-progress stuff is ready to go, or is rolled back.<p>Also high priority stuff tends to go to &quot;that one wizard guy&quot;. Unfortunately that one wizard guy is backed up with 6 months of other projects, cause he&#x27;s the wizard.<p>Is it &quot;right&quot;? no, of course not.

(They tried and were burned by at least one of the prior CIO approaches)<p>I think those organizations are pretty screwed. they are incapable of change at the layer they need. Banks, schools, airlines, machine shops, anyplace there&#x27;s a large sized in house dev team (30+), that team is going to very likely kind of suck.

Docker is a first-class citizen on Linux, and a second-class citizen everywhere else. &quot;Setting up Docker&quot; on Linux means installing the Docker daemon. &quot;Setting up Docker&quot; on OSX or Windows means <i>installing a Linux VM containing Docker</i> and getting it to port-forward the docker daemon from that VM to your host. After it&#x27;s set up, there&#x27;s no day-to-day usage difference—but that stumbling block is a big one.<p>2. Nothing AWS offers—no matter how much it might look that way—is an end-user platform. It&#x27;s all infrastructure, the kind of thing sysadmins set up/deal with. Infrastructure-as-a-Service effectively means &quot;our market is bigcorp CIOs making buy-vs-build decisions&quot;: decisions of whether to provision more local data-center infrastructure, or provision that same infrastructure &quot;in the cloud.&quot;<p>In other words: Elastic Beanstalk isn&#x27;t for prototyping an instance of your app! Instead, it&#x27;s for CIOs considering replacing &quot;our data center containing a bunch of machines with docker daemons on them&quot; with &quot;our AWS VPC containing a bunch of opaque instances with docker daemons on them.&quot; The same goes for every other AWS service: the documentation and &quot;semantic models&quot; of AWS services are not <i>targeted at</i> app developers, but rather at the <i>sysadmins</i> who were implementing the CIO&#x27;s whims by keeping local infrastructure going at-scale, and are now implementing the CIO&#x27;s whims by porting said infrastructure to the Amazon cloud.<p>AWS might be intuitive to you as a developer <i>if</i> you have 5+ years of devops experience, deploying your own code and and managing the infrastructure it sits on. Otherwise, the choices AWS offers will be pretty opaque to you.<p>(Side-note: there&#x27;s a business model [that AWS allows and encourages] in taking an AWS IaaS-level component, and shellacking a coat of UX onto it to make it <i>into</i> a PaaS component, and making your money by arbitraging on the &quot;PaaS premium.&quot; Heroku is PaaS-shellacked EC2 instances; Tarsnap (or Dropbox, even) is PaaS-shellacked S3 buckets; etc. I&#x27;m surprised more of these businesses don&#x27;t exist.)",1448238007

10612091,comment,10609247,10611653,0,0,dpeterson,,,"Even on a small scale there are significant benefits, both in production and in development and test.  As the article states, containers are great for moving away from a monolith architecture.  Many applications are moving to a distributed service oriented architecture.  Each piece can be deployed separate.  That leads to an easier more maintainable development process.  However, the larger number of independently deployable apps adds operation complexity.  Trying to manage that complexity, even on a small scale is no fun.  Queue containers.  Containers by themselves are interesting; they let you run many more applications on a single machine.  Unlike a VM, there is no operating system chewing up ram and cpu.  On machines only able to run 4 VM&#x27;s reasonably well, I have seen nearly a hundred containers.  That is only a small part. Container platforms such as Openshift make the process much nicer and more powerful.  Openshift uses Kubernetes under the covers.  You arrange your applications inside pods.  The pods are wrapped in a Kubernetes service.  The pods automatically assign internal ip addresses; that allows you to put, let&#x27;s say, 20 wildfly servers on the same machine without worrying about ip and port clashes.  The service acts as a load balancer and a router directs traffic accordingly.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about any of that.  It is all automated.  I create a build config and a deployment config for my services (there could be hundreds) then Openshift (or other container PAAS) maximizes the potential of my hardware.  In development, it is much easier to completely replicate production.  Everything is encapsulated in the container image.  Not just the application; all of the software and configuration the application requires is part of the image.  If I need to recreate the container image, every step is in the Dockerfile.  I do not need documentation to remind me how everything is set up.  In openshift, I grab a template, then click a button; within seconds, the containers of my app are running.  That would take much longer with VMs.  Containers allow me to develop in a production like environment because I am able to deploy an unscaled version easily.  What took multiple physical machines to replicate now takes a few seconds to deploy on a laptop.",1448236885

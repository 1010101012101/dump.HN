Then PayPal froze my account, when I had about $2,500 in it. I needed that money to pay rent. It took about 6 weeks before they re-opened my account. To pay rent I had to borrow money from friends and family. PayPal was very hard to deal with. They kept asking for proof that I was me. They wanted me to send bills that verified my address, but I was subletting an apartment for 3 months and had very little evidence that I was really me.<p>At another time some friends of mine started a business with me and we had a PayPal account for awhile. At some point we stopped using it, and then someone sent us $200. I've no idea what happened to that $200. Possibly it got auto-refunded at some point. Possibly it is still sitting there, in the account. Whatever email address we used for that account was tied to the company we had, which had a domain name we gave up on years ago.<p>All the same, PayPal is the easiest way to go when you are starting up a new site.

Nokia actually enforced arcane third-party code signing/testing for apps on Symbian... who builds a developer platform and thinks that's a reasonable idea?<p>Ovi Store: Whereas RIM also does carrier-integrated billing for BlackBerry App World, RIM provides the developer with a consistent 70/30 split on app sales, and consistent payment intervals. With Nokia? Your split varies WILDLY from operator to operator, potentially being 35% of gross app price or lower on some operators, and you get paid depending on when those operators decide to remit payment. So, even with the most carrier relationships on earth, Nokia can't even do a decent job getting developers paid.<p>So, Nokia hasn't got an especially sexy UI w/ Meego, they've not got a great developer tools story (indeed with WRT and QT they have a history of screwing up even when they have a technology advantage), and they understand so little of the app developer needs that they can't even build a billing solution that competes with what RIM have built with App World.",1284133126

And it might be a similar financial strategy that Amazon has famously used from day 1. Amazon collect payments immediately, yet ships items much later. This means their cashflow is always more than their inventory expenses at any given moment. For however much time there is until that gap closes, Amazon is in a great position—essentially getting a short term loan, and if you consider their volume of transactions, that is billions of cash being held in floating pools.<p><i>What if Paypal provides a similar benefit to Ebay's bottom line?</i> Paypal isn't a bank, so they can do whatever they want with the held funds. I suppose what actually happens to the held funds is a corporate secret they guard carefully. But I bet it props up Ebay's cashflow in a major way. If Ebay changed ways and forced Paypal to provide better guarantees, much like a bank, then their cashflow would take a hit.<p>Good idea or am I off?",1284133113

Safari on iOS certainly has no way of accomodating something akin to a Flash plugin.<p>What Apple have OK-ed is using tools other that XCode to produce standalone apps and one of the tools this now allows is Adobe's Flash to iPhone app builder which, very roughly speaking, takes the source of a Flash application and creates an iPhone app with the same functionality.<p>But the apps it produces are not Flash, they're standalone native iPhone apps, they can't download or run Flash from the web, they sit outside the browser, they still have to go through the app store and are still subject to Apple's rules and restrictions.<p>In terms of restricting things to the App Store - Apple already allow a mechanism for going to the web and running apps that don't go through the App Store.  It's called web standards - HTML/CSS/JS/H264 and so on - indeed for a while it was the only mechanism they supported.<p>The App Store contributes 1% of Apple's profits (high volume but the margin is pretty low as you've got to host, review and distribute every app, regardless of cost or sales).

For example, it is illegal to fire a rank-and-file employee just for exploring other job options. If they look for a job on their own time and equipment, that's their business and they can't be fired for this alone.<p>Managers are entitled to no such protection. A manager is considered to be a more vital component of the company's value, and as such the act of seeking another job without negotiating this in advance with your current employer is considered a breach of your obligations to the company even if you do so on your own time.<p>There's some fuzziness involved. Is a team lead considered a manager or a senior developer with some project management responsibilities? Is an Architecture Astronaut with no reports but crucial IP responsibility entitled to job hunt without permission?<p>Getting back to this situation, my point is that there is a difference between the obligations of a CEO and the obligations of a rank-and-file employee. Laws erected to protect employees at the expense of the company shouldn't apply to CEOs. Obviously, California's laws are whatever they are for whatever reason.

San Diego is expensive, and just making ends meet can be a challenge for someone low on the pay scale, and he was trying to balance this with paying for tuition, books, a laptop, and so forth.<p>Now, add in the fact that he's trying to get good grades in data structures and algorithms, vector calc, physics, and a general education elective.  He ended up dropping the data structures class.<p>Now, people drop that class for all kinds of reasons.  But personally, I'd rather not see America's promising young minds struggling with a 30 hr a week retail job while taking a heavy course load of math, physics, and engineering.  I've heard of students putting 20-30 hours a week into data structures alone.  This can lead to 70+ hour weeks.  It's character building, and some extraordinary people will succeed, but I think we need to recognize that this would knock many students with above average motivation, study habits, and intelligence out of the game.<p>Unfortunately, the answer for the ""middle class"" may be to target universities near home and stay with the parents.

(A recent article on why this case law makes HP's Hurd case an uphill fight appears here: <a href=""http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202471748471"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202471748471</a>).<p>Basically, California law prohibits non-competes in a post-employment context unless coupled with a transfer of a goodwill interest (e.g., when your business is acquired) and, when an employer complains that a former employee will ""inevitably"" disclose valuable trade secret information by reason of his position with a new firm, the courts have rightly interpreted this position as an after-the-fact attempt by the employer to get what amounts to non-compete-style protection where the law otherwise forbids this.<p>At the same time, HP is not without arguments because California's adoption of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act does authorize courts to enjoin ""threatened"" violations of an employer's trade secrets. This usually means the employer has to present detailed evidence that the former employee's role in the new company poses a clear threat that this would happen. Of course, without additional evidence, the mere fact that the employee's new position poses such risks really amounts to ""inevitable disclosure"" (which the courts reject) and this means that a complaining party is not likely to win such a case unless it really does have some other evidence strongly suggesting that trade secrets are likely to be compromised. That is why it is such an uphill fight for the employer.<p>Inevitable disclosure cases are often upheld elsewhere in the U.S. but even then it most often happens when the departing executive is shown to have done suspicious things along the way (see, e.g., this piece summarizing why a guy who was one of a handful of people in the world to know the ingredients and processes by which Thomas' English muffins achieve their ""nook and cranny"" feel could legitimately be enjoined from joining a direct competitor, and where the evidence showed that he hung around for months after secretly accepting the competing employment and, in effect, gathered information from his old employer in anticipation of the move: <a href=""http://chicagobreakingbusiness.com/2010/07/english-muffin-secrets-safe-at-thomas-for-now.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicagobreakingbusiness.com/2010/07/english-muffin-se...</a>).<p>In my view of it, major egos are involved on both sides of this Hurd mess and that is likely what is driving this lawsuit. It will therefore be brutally fought and, if there is an ounce of anything in the law to support an injunction, HP will scrape for and find it. Given the well-settled California law, however, this effort is likely to amount only to a wild swing that is unlikely to land. This may mean that Mr. Hurd will get a windfall while HP is left with nothing but a black eye, but that is what is most likely to happen.",1284132219

1679049,comment,1678219,1678908,0,0,roel_v,,,"To elaborate, the rub here was that ATL heavily relies on templates, code that is instantiated by the client at build time. The fix (IIRC but I don't see any other explanations either) required a change in one of those compiled-at-build-time parts (i.e, in the header), and was of such nature that it changed the ABI. If the part that had the bug had been able to be included in a dll (but it couldn't be because of the way templates work), swapping out the dll would have worked.<p>So arguably it was exactly the static linking (forced by the language) that was at fault here. People who linked dynamically were forced to make some painful changes, but those who linked statically potentially had the security bug left in their programs. I'm not sure who of the two would be worse off here. I guess at Microsoft they considered the security implications severe enough to warrant a patch as disruptive as this one was.",1284131224

Why should you be forced to march through every subject lock-step with 30-100 other students at a median pace that's probably unsuitable for 2/3 of the class in any given week? Why should your learning be doled out in time chunks that are arbitrarily convenient for administrative purposes and nothing more? Why limit your study to the handful of sanctified texts when you have the entire internet at your fingers? Why pay that hefty tuition to sit in a lecture hall so crowded you may never ask the teacher a single question only to move to a T.A. section run by a harried grad student that often barely speaks English?

It's hard to argue that $30+MM(!) is inadequate consideration for an executive noncompete. Most people, even those who (like me) detest noncompete agreements, can grudgingly accept the notion that it's fair and reasonable for two parties to agree to set one up with two lifetime's worth of compensation in exchange for avoidance of competition.<p>So far as I can tell, none of the exceptions to the ""noncompetes are invalid in California"" policy cover Hurd, who isn't a partner at HP and hasn't accepted the noncompete as part of the sale of a huge chunk of HP stock. HP is left with the much fuzzier trade secret enforcement path to express a much simpler ""don't go fuck us"" agreement.",1284130995

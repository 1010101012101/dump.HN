We're running out of places for such putatively better mechanisms to hide.<p>I dislike this line of argument in the modern time, because it conflates two discussions, ""what we scientifically know about the universe"", and ""could conceivable be true even though we have no evidence for our conjectures"". While the second may be superficially more fun, it's ultimately a waste of time for any sort of serious discussion because you can hypothesize <i>anything</i> you want. It's content-free, despite the haze of words you can throw up. The first is much more interesting, and while 50 years ago one could still hypothesize better communication mechanisms, I think the argument when used in a <i>serious</i> discussion is out of date.

They're fine! They're not evil or anything. But they are ultimately less elegant and reader friendly than truly good, considered, well constructed and ordered paragraphs.

And the upper-left in windows (by which you really mean a maximized windows app -- windows puts nothing there, and I only occasionally  have anything maximized) is the ""context menu"", which is near useless, being duplicated functionality with the existing window buttons.  Note that Chrome doesn't use a context menu button, for example.  I think arguing that windows puts something ""useful"" there is disingenuous.  Windows merely puts ""something"" there.<p>I guess the top bar argument is valid, though note that there are a bunch of gnome-shell extensions that like to use the space.

Playing more devil's advocate, the only thing that should really be illegal is exploiting children when they can be shown to be incapable of sound personal choices. (So covering both child porn and Britney-Spears-pattern Disney stars at once.) Now we just have to worry about where we draw the line at exploitation and whether potential monetary or status gain is important or not. The main point though is the act has already occurred by the time some pedo sees it on a tor page, and I don't think it's ever been shown that pedo-consumers are much more likely to become pedo-producers if they weren't already. (Someone please correct my belief if that's not the case, and then explain Japan.)

3382626,comment,3381418,3381418,3,0,chops,,,"Note that while I generally like the Erlang syntax, there's one main issue where syntax quirks come back to bite me: the combination of Erlang records with a missed line ending. This topic comes up on occasion on the mailing list and apparently it's a side effect of a change that was made to make Erlang records a little easier to work with.<p>In short, if you've got two records in a list, and forget to end the first one with the comma line ending, the behavior becomes a bit unpredictable.<p><pre><code>  [\n   #myrecord{\n    field1=""whatever"",\n    field2=123\n   }\n   #myrecord{\n    field1=""booyah"",\n    field3=3.14\n   }\n  ].\n</code></pre>\nThat statement would mysteriously return a list with a single element:<p><pre><code>  [ #myrecord{field1=""booyah"", field2=123, field3=3.14 } ]\n</code></pre>\nAnd all because of the missed comma after the first #myrecord { }.<p>What's happening can be visualized by the (sort of) equivalent version here:<p><pre><code>  R1 = #myrecord{\n   field1=""whatever"",\n   field2=123\n  },\n  [\n   R1\n   #myrecord{\n    field1=""booyah"",\n    field2=3.14\n   }\n  ].\n   </code></pre>\nSo you can see that the second #myrecord is overwriting the values in R1, since you can do syntax like R1#myrecord{ ... } to take the values of R1, and overwrite them with whatever you need to.<p>The reason that happens is due to a compiler change a while back to make record syntax no longer require being wrapped in parens. This is due to having records with values in them being records, and it makes it easier to access those records.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  Mybook#book.author#author.name\n</code></pre>\nWhich is an OOP language's equivalent of something like:<p><pre><code>  Mybook.author.name\n</code></pre>\nThis previously used to be required to be written like this (correct me if I'm wrong, this syntax is before my time):<p><pre><code>  ((Mybook#book.author)#author.name).\n</code></pre>\nWhich removed ambiguity. Errors like my first example then would be caught by the runtime if records were written in the ""old"" style:<p><pre><code>  [\n   (#myrecord{\n    field1=""whatever"",\n    field2=123\n   })\n   (#myrecord{\n    field1=""booyah"",\n    field3=3.14\n   })\n  ].\n</code></pre>\nWill generate an invalid function error (still not a great error, but it makes sense in this regard.<p>My hope is that this class of error caused by the syntax will be somewhat minimized if Ericcson decides to merge the erlson[1] project into an official release of Erlang, replacing the somewhat clunky record syntax with something a little more ""modern"".<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/alavrik/erlson"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alavrik/erlson</a> - An object notation for Erlang, but which in order to be a decent record replacement will need to support pattern matching.",1324578359

I'm willing to pay someone $10/hour to clean my house. My startup would love to employ fashionable girls for mechanical turk work at wages far below the US minimum wage (we employ several of them in India). So how come unemployment exists at all?<p>Keynesian economics postulates wage stickiness as an explanation for this unemployment.<p><i>That is why I say that you need to be able to break contracts too - then whole economy would need to be able to realign in a very short period of time to match the effects the spending can have in the same period of time.</i><p>This is not Keynesian economics. This is a structural theory of recessions - things have changed, and the economy needs time to re-adjust. I.e., a former construction worker in CA needs time and training to find a new job, the business owner needs to renegotiate contracts or go bankrupt, etc.<p>Note that in structural theories, monetary or fiscal stimulus has no clear effect, and government spending/austerity measures should focus on getting fundamentals right (i.e., eliminate wasteful spending) and speeding up adjustment (promoting job mobility).<p><i>Do you have another way that would work and quickly that I am not seeing?</i><p>The easiest would be cutting the pay of government workers, cuts to payroll taxes (particularly the employer side), and reducing unemployment benefits and welfare.<p>Another method would deal with unions. If any union refuses an immediate cut in total comp, the employer gains the right to fire union workers and permanently replace them with non-union workers.<p><i>But if you accept my premise that this is the path and believe the unions are too powerful then wage stickiness is a moot point - as a non-starter why bother discussing it, Keynesian or not?</i><p>Intellectual curiosity, mostly. So far, I've only seen a single Keynesian (Karl Smith) actively promote wage flexibility, in spite of the fact that it's a logical conclusion of the theory.<p>It's also relevant to this discussion - Greece has absolutely no ability to prevent austerity (they run at a budget deficit, even ignoring interest/debt service), but they do have the ability to promote wage flexibility within their own borders.",1324578200

You read Chinese article from the communist China, or you read the Chinese classics like Analects of Confucious, or you read the government documents from Taiwan, or even the Japanese Emperor's Imperial Rescript on the Termination of the War, you see different Chinese there.

Remember, Faraday was asked the same questions about his work on electricity.\nObviously the big thing the Higgs is giving us is clues towards a theory of quantum gravity. We don't and can't know how useful that would be, but you only have to look to the last unification (QM) to see the potential. Perhaps my answer is ""something that is to quantum computers as quantum computers are to regular computers"", but we haven't even built a useful quantum computer yet. At the same time, transistor design for ""regular"" computers relies heavily on QM. So perhaps a better answer is ""something that is to today's computers as today's computers are to things that were around in the '20s"".

Join the experiment at www.helpturnaround.com<p>""How about offering Android OS, Windows OS, and QNX on BlackBerry devices. Sounds drastic, but it may just help RIM regain their market share. BlackBerrys OS is primitive by current standards, think Palm OS. However, the brand name and hardware still resonates with consumers (typing without keys, hell no!). Given the option to buy an Android HTC, Samsung, or BlackBerry, I would buy an Android BlackBerry. There is strong brand affinity with BlackBerry, and Berrys are perceived as quality devices. I think most folks would buy an Android BlackBerry. This would be similar to how consumers were receptive to Kindle Fire vs. (insert manufacturer) tablets. Hello, market share.<p>Lets dig into Kindle Fire and Multi-OS BlackBerry analogy deeper. Quite understandably, the phone market is very different from the tablet market. But Amazons Fire was a success given the brand affinity (Amazon/ Kindle), perceived quality, and PRICE. Amazon can sell the Fire at a loss, and make up for it with content revenue. RIM can probably steal a page from Amazons playbook, but herein lies the problem  there is not enough compelling content for BlackBerry devices. However, by offering Windows OS, Android OS, and QNX on BlackBerry devices RIM can potentially make significant headway in the content space as well. Imagine a curated Android, Windows, and QNX app store with excellent search and discovery features. Hello, Mr. Bezos.<p>Would this alienate RIMs corporate clientele? Probably not, given RIMs recent announcement of multi-platform BlackBerry Enterprise solution.<p>Is this a huge undertaking? Sure. Will it be easy? No, but nothing is.

Obviously one can argue about what is and what isn't useful, but from a purely objective viewpoint, one can definitely say that Gnome-Shell doesn't take full advantage of those extremely important corners.<p>As for my other points, for example the top bar: how can you deny that it's mostly wasted space?

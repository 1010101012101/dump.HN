So now comes Facebook and leaches the common &quot;free&quot; network built and paid by others, and then extends the Internet network pretty much in the way it was done till now but it doesn&#x27;t offer it back in the same way!

10811840,comment,10804893,10811703,0,0,afsina,,,"Of course I am not defending jailing journalists. But there is something a little deeper here. During 2013 and 2014 there was an unprecedented political power struggle between Erdogan and Gulen ( <a href=""http://www.city-journal.org/2012/22_4_fethullah-gulen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.city-journal.org/2012/22_4_fethullah-gulen.html</a> ) whose cult has/had deep roots in the government especially in the police force, bureaucracy and justice system. They control many media outlets. After the breaking point, their sole aim was to overthrow Erdogan from his position, either because he started to block their spreading in the state, or because he simply did not want them anymore.<p>So they throw whatever they have in their hands, probably with a lot of manipulation. They attacked him and his family quite strongly with corruption claims (I would take them more seriously if there wasnt another motive behind all that). One of the attack point was about Syrian conflict. Probably government was supplying logistics help to the rebel groups fighting with Assads government but using their people in the key points they actually interfered with this action and presented this as if Government is helping IS. These journalists in question were also used as a proxy for spreading this. Now that Gulen has lost the battle big time, Government is taking his revenge by making some of their supporters lives miserable. But although they are now in the shadows they are silently continuing their attacks. From my point of view, Gulen&#x27;s secret cult&#x27;s utopia is more dangerous than Erdogans bravado. At least he is honest on what he says, no matter good or bad.",1451479680

I want code that reflects the way I think, not code I have to work to understand.<p>I did not know but am not surprised to find that people write procedural Haskell. Procedural is how we all start out thinking about things. You do A, then B, to reach goal C. It takes time and experience and deliberate practice to improve upon that way of solving problems.<p>Functional moves the code in the direction of math. OOP moves in the direction of the domain. Math is harder to understand than domain logic, you will inevitably hack together an object system on top of your FP in order to implement domain logic.<p>Both styles have properties that are work better for certain domain concepts. What&#x27;s nice about modern programming languages is that they build in primitives so you can use whichever style fits the concept you&#x27;re fleshing out.<p>But trying to do everything functionally is ultimately counter-productive, in my opinion. It&#x27;s the wrong format to declare high-level domain logic in, because high-level domain logic is that which is closest to human thought, not the underlying math.<p>Any FP &#x27;architecture&#x27; will pretty much be object oriented.

874387,comment,874330,874355,0,0,weaksauce,,,"I would caution against an over zealous changing of ideas. The reason that a lot of entrepreneurs fail is because they are too agile in changing ideas in search of the perfect one and never follow through with one of the decent ideas. There is not a perfect idea. The path to riches is through hard work and dedication to an idea that you can execute better than most. You do not need to have the best execution or idea to be a successful entrepreneur.<p>With that said good luck on your journey!",1255240389

What are your avg monthly usage requirements- box and bandwidth? And how these requirements shall change of time.<p>A.	Currently we are still in development, so these are still to be determined. Part of our service will be serving video content.<p>3.	Q. You want to customize you box's configuration before u rent it?<p>A.	Yes, we will need to mod apache and harden the OS.<p>4.	Q. You want to pay monthly or yearly or more?<p>A.	Cash flow currently dictates monthly.<p>5.	Q. Will you need additional throw away on demand computational nodes? How often?<p>A.	“Computational Nodes” as far a grid hosting no. I’m not a cloud expert but if it is handled by the scalability of the cloud probably. How often would still need to be determined.<p>6.	Q. Do you just wish to use servers or other services like S3, SDB, SQS, cloud-files(rackspace)?<p>A.

If you accept that your own abilities are also limited and that you might make costly mistakes, you might conclude that the total downtime will probably be the same. Say X hours per year.

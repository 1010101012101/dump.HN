Usually there are lower hanging fruits to be gathered regarding client-side performance, and I am not even sure it is worth to bother with CSS performance: 100ms on huge page is not that much. Also there are other factors to consider: adding classes to your markup will increase it's size, and it will be downloaded every time (with millions of hits it adds up). CSS on the other hand can be cached and have zero impact on load time (expires set into future). Non-semantic class names are ugly.\nMy ideal page would use as little IDs and classes as possible (preferably none, doable with HTML5 where you can use semantic elements instead of trying to give some semantic meaning to the DIV via some class name). Yes descendent selectors and friends are slower than direct targeting with id or class, but the difference is negligible.\nSpend your time reducing the number of http requests, minimizing js, taking care of parallel loading, setting proper expires and cache control headers, don't sweat about CSS selectors speed.",1281008477

If a release misses the train, then it can wait for the next one to leave the station. This allows all groups to plan ahead, make sure they have resources available, etc.<p><i>The production and development environment just aren't in synch and this never gets addressed.</i><p>This is pretty inexcusable, it's a matter of laziness or unwillingness to spend the time to make the environment better. You can clearly see the effects of this bad practice when you have releases that fail in production and have to be re-tried several times. If the production environment is so complex that it can't easily be mirrored in development, at the very least the release should be tested in a staging environment (not QA) which does mirror production - so you can <i>test</i> the release process itself.<p>The fundamental problem that nhashem seems to be describing are admins that don't seem to care too much about whether or not new software releases are being released in a timely fashion to production. While I understand that the admins have a whole lot of other areas to also be responsible for, the entire reason why someone wants to release this software in the first place is that there is some business value in the release/new version/feature etc. Not allowing this release to reach customers as fast as possible reduces it's value. If the company is not focused on getting value in front of the customer as quickly as possible, then why are they even spending the time developing the software/changes in the first place?<p>This is why it's a management failure - a failure to plan, get teams to work together, and cut things down to the bottom line of delivering value to the customer as rapidly as possible while still maintaining stability and other responsibilities. Company's that can't do these things will have their lunch eaten by competitors who can.",1281008177

Honestly, I experience 10x as much pain from the _for_ loop as I do from exceptions, for crying out load!<p>Maybe if I had spent more of my like working with particularly ugly Java systems, then I might feel differently. But when using C++, Lisp, Dylan, Schema, Python and Ruby, exception handling has always been completely painless. Well, in C++, you need to use RAII, and sometimes you need to write WITH-OPEN-FILE or File.open {|f| ... }. But this is an order of magnitude easier than making explicit error-handling correct.<p>In fairness to Go, exception handling is much trickier when you live in a world of lightweight co-routines. But again, Erlang seems to generalize things in a plausible way: Declare links between co-operating processes, and propagate failures across those links until somebody wants to catch them and recover.<p>It looks like Go is slowly moving in that direction.

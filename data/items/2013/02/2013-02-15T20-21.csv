5228635,comment,5228200,5228410,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There are two ways to look at this, and depending on your point of view you might be upset.The root of the dispute is how they scale and how that affects latency.<p>According to these write-ups, Heroku scales performance by doing dynamic scheduling on an array of identical servers (called 'dynos'). The documentation talks about a feature named ""Intelligent Routing"" which only sends work to a dyno which is available to do work.<p>That is a pretty ideal setup because in practice it means that you get linear scaling by adding server instances, and since costs are based on total server instances you get both linear scale increase with linear cost increase.<p>However, there is a very classical problem, first noted by Gene Amdahl, about the cost of figuring out how best to parallelize a stream of requests, vs the rate at which you could satisfy those requests. It became known as ""Amdahl's Law""[1]. It limits the practical scalability of a lot of systems.<p>So at some point, Heroku got big enough, that the cost of figuring out which server instance wasn't busy, was taking ""too long"". (that cost is the (1-P) part in the Amdahl equation) so they decided to reduce the cost of making the choice by replacing a ""data driven choice"" with a ""statistics driven choice"". This too is actually a pretty well known way of doing things (Google and Blekko use it to send search queries to a bunch of waiting backends) But unlike the 'idealized' case which has every server instance handling at most one queue, the value becomes a probability that the server instance is either not-busy, or that the current transaction will finish quickly. This works well for systems where the cost of every transaction is nearly identical, you just add servers until the 90th percentile of requests hits your target, but poorly for systems where each request has a variable amount of work it might do.<p>I spent a number of years studying these sorts of systems while solving scalability issues at Network Appliance. A file system built out of a distributed set of nodes providing access to a single file system image needs to know a-priori the cost of each transaction flowing through it in order to optimize scheduling. Similarly RAID subsystems need to know which disk I/Os are going to land in the cache or on the disk, and if they land on the disk will they result in a seek or not. You end up with a directed graph of weighted probabilities being shoved through a channel of fixed bandwidth. Its all amazingly fun until someone says ""I have to get data back from the disk in no less than 10mS every time"" (databases would say stuff like that) and then you start trading dollars for milliseconds as they say.<p>So Heroku changed their algorithm, didn't tell anyone, and the systemic behavior changed in a very user visible way for large users (in this case Rap Genius). The folks at Rap Genius were pissed off that they made this change without informing them, and they, Rap Genius, looked bad to their customers because of it. Nobody in operations wants to say ""Uh, I don't know why your experience with our service is currently sucking.""<p>I can see why Rap Genius is mad, and I can see that Heroku might not have fully thought through the ramifications of their algorithm change.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law</a>",1360961970

Some of your examples also aren't convincing:  there is a lot of evidence that after controlling for socioeconomic status and other similar factors, black and white people are the same, and that rape is traumatic (rates of depression, PTSD, etc. following it).  And personal feelings actually are admissible evidence, if the questions you're asking are designed correctly.  The 'right to freedom' and valuing people with physical or mental disabilities are moral issues, but they are also fundamentally different from the claims the official was reported to be making.<p>Something like 'longterm damage' is something that can be quantified and measured (correlation, at least). There are a variety of psychological examinations (such as those for trauma, underlying biases, etc.) that you could use to see if early (or earlier) self reported access to pornography in fact correlates to different mental/emotional states later in life.  At that point you have quantified changes and can point to them and argue societal values.<p>The moral argument would be ""Children should not be exposed to pornography simply because it is not suitable for people under (age)"", not positing things about potential, unquantified 'longterm damage'.  We can argue all day about the morals and societal expectations, and it's perfectly reasonable to do so with regards to pornography, but if someone makes a quantifiable argument, they should provide evidence to back it up, or a compelling reason as to why evidence isn't available and why acting without it is still important.

The decision to buy a Model S very likely hinges on whether one can use the Supercharger network.  Finding the station is almost as important as whether or not the stations exist <i>at all</i>.<p>So, given that, why would he omit this particular detail from the original review?  Broder wrote three pages in his original article, and wasted a lot of space writing about the bitter cold inside the cabin.  Are you seriously suggesting that such a talented writer (and I do believe he is that) was not able to find space in his review for this very important detail?<p>It strikes me that the simplest, and most logical, explanation is that Broder was not actually looking for the station a the time he was allegedly ""driving in circles.""

Sorry if this isn't the normal style for posts, I haven't been on here long.<p>Essentially, I recently found a publicly facing document which detailed ALL of the root passwords for a Fortune 100 company. (Amongst other things, it was an open directory which also included all of the staff VPN passwords, and other sensitive information including SQL backups). I immediately reported this issue to them. I was told they would get back to me, and after reporting the issue I have sent multiple followup emails and have been selectively ignored. (I stumbled upon the root passwords completely by accident while looking around Google for information relating to an unrelated company). They have now removed the documents in question, (though they are still cached by Google). Should I let this go? I'm not sure whether it's worth pursuing. I don't want recognition, or hush money.

It's tempting to believe in some kind of objective reality when it comes to communication, but communication has two very subjective sides:<p>1) What the speaker has said<p>2) What the listener has understood<p>A very good teacher knows how to assess #2 in a continuous feedback loop. Unfortunately, one's sensitivity to this feedback is greatly diminished over the phone. This often results in outcomes where the speaker and the listener have very different accounts of what was communicated.<p>After reading all of the back and forth, the only conclusion I can reach is that Broder didn't have any ill intentions,and  Tesla staff tried to help him, but the outcome still wasn't good.<p>The actions Broder took didn't allow him to reach his goals. You may hold an opinion as to whether he was too conservative/liberal with his approach to charging and efficiency management. You might hold an opinion as to whether or not he properly interpreted Tesla's advice, but it doesn't change the facts of the matter. He didn't make it to where he was headed, and his trip goals was pretty typical.<p>Broder strikes me as a pretty ""normal"" person. He doesn't seem biased toward or against the car. He seems rather indifferent, which is how many American drivers feel about their cars. 
If Tesla's pitch is that this car is ""just as good"" as a gasoline car, then they've clearly over-pitched.<p>Whether Elon Musk wants to admit it, the Model S does require considerations that we're not used to making with gasoline powered cars. Making 1 hour pit stops to ""refuel"" every 200 miles has a pretty serious impact on trip times when compared to a gasoline powered car that can stretch to 300 miles between fill-ups and can be back on the road in 10 minutes.<p>A good tact at this point might be to realign their message with the car's capabilities and offer an olive branch to Broder.

GCJ works like that for instance. The resulting performance from binaries of such compilers is abysmal though.<p>C# is not really a good example because C# was designed for AOT compilation.

He doesn't really dispute anything Musk says, but only tries to excuse it.<p>I'm usually on the side of not talking back to reviewers of your work, having read that advice over and over in essays and articles by wise authors and other creative types.  In this case, though, everyone I've spoken to in person about this is convinced that Broder was just trying to tell the most entertaining story; Musk, given his accomplishments, naturally has higher credibility than Broder.

5228225,comment,5227900,5227900,1,0,moron4hire,,,"I am extremely contrarian on this issue.<p>While the possibility of someone making your ""internal"" state inconsistent is a near certainty, it is by no means your problem, nor should it be. Because otherwise you're making a bet that your code is perfect and won't ever NEED having its internals changed by someone other than you.<p>I've dealt with way too many buggy libraries to believe that any such thing as simple as design patterns and coding principles and abstractions and whatever other religions we're teaching in software engineering schools these days made better software. We've had 50 years of software engineering research and we're not making better software. Because it's not the tools' fault. Good workmen will create good results no matter the lack of quality of their tools; bad workmen will create bad results no matter the quality of their tools. I'm done believing the lie that we can hire just anyone for a job, as long as we give them the right tools, the right direction, the right restrictions, the right <i>control</i>. The person behind the tool is far, far more important.<p>The likelihood that the library code is perfect for all purposes is slim-to-none. The implementing developer will thus NEED access to your internals to make use of the library, or else move on to another library. That's basically what Open Source software is all about: dealing with hidden internals through the vendor is too tedious, expensive, and time consuming, so give the implementing developer full access to the source code, the ultimate of ""internals"".<p>As for the notion that it greatly expands your public interface, again, that is a certainty, and as well extremely not your problem. I guess since I don't use antique programming tools like C in basic, bare text editors, this probably isn't an issue I can completely understand, but if someone changes the interface in a future version, then I... either stick to the old version or change my code to suit. Bug fixes in the new version that didn't get back-ported to the old version? Again, <i>if I just had access to those damn internals</i>, I could do the back-porting myself and it wouldn't be a problem. Or I would learn there is a fundamental failing of the original library that prevents the bug from being fixed. And then appreciate better why the API had to change.<p>Code isn't that hard to change, especially if you stop expecting it to be hard to change. Hell, it's not even a problem for me to use two different versions of the same library so I don't lose functionality over time while I migrate. I like good code, and I like a well designed system, and I used to get really bent out of shape about such things, but I also like living and getting on with my life. Screw it, hack it. It's really not that big of a deal. If it works, it works, and you're done with it until it no longer works. That's the case no matter the scenario, for all N works over time T.<p>That's basically what Test Driven Development is all about: do what is necessary and sufficient, no more, no less, until it's no longer sufficient or necessary. If you're not doing only what is necessary, if you're writing unnecessary code, then you're wasting time that could be spent creating a real work of art that means something to someone, or exercising, or washing your butt. More importantly, you're spending my money on a mental masturbation trip to write code that was never asked for.<p>So yeah, don't hide your internals. You're more likely to drive people away.",1360958745

The one real 'downside' - prebuffering - is absolutely trivial to compensate for and the code to do it in JS is not any larger than the necessary scaffolding to make basic use of Web Audio.<p>Chrome was always the loser here; I won't speculate as to the reasons why, only state that for multiple versions, playing simple sound effects with Audio instances had severe latency, audio quality issues, and even crashes. Why wouldn't devs praise the Web Audio API if the only alternative was broken? I certainly was happy when I finally managed to get my HTML5 games to play audio in Chrome without crashing, but that doesn't mean the Web Audio API is well-designed or that it was a good idea for me to have to write Chrome-specific code just to play sound effects.<p>I'll acknowledge that Web Audio's design probably delivers better runtime performance in scenarios where you're playing dozens or hundreds of non-streaming sound effects, but I still question the motives of anyone who prioritized that over having <i>basic support</i> for audio working correctly.<p>EDIT: Because I forgot to mention this - I mean seriously, you put a method call in the Web Audio API that blocks the UI thread to synchronously decode audio? In 2012??? And didn't cover the documentation in 'don't use this' warnings?",1360958473

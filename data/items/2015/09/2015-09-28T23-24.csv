10293967,comment,10292541,10293323,0,0,e12e,,,"I think Medium makes incremental improvement(s) over some alternatives. I&#x27;m not sure if the sum of those improvements will mean Medium will turn a profit, grow or survive, but here are a couple of thoughts:<p>Medium is content-first. All blogs <i>should</i> arguably be content-first, very few are. Most wordpress blogs a) look like crap, b) obscures content, and c) renders slow, in order to accommodate the design that contributes to a) and b).<p>I&#x27;m not a writer, but from what I understand, the back-end is also content-first, writing first -- simple, elegant, no clutter.<p>The lack of theming is a bonus. Just as design/layout of an essay in New York Magazine is largely out of your hands, and taken care of by the publisher, so it is with Medium. Evidence suggests that the vast majority of writers are better off that way (see point above).<p>Ghost and many of the static site generators offer similar benefits, but with some caveats: they all need theming, and I&#x27;m not sure if any of them really come with something that in sum is as good as/better than Medium. Personally I think even Medium is a bit heavy -- but it is <i>way</i> better than then current mess that is Blogspot.<p>If your goal is to write/publish and not worry too much about design/layout you could do a lot worse than Medium. Many do.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Medium differentiated/launched curated sub-sites/&quot;magazines&quot; that featured content from Medium. They could have some premium stuff that is authored by only paid authors, mix and match, and have a X articles/month-for-free model a la New York Times etc.<p>If the can get a large number of writers, and a large sub-section of good/great writers -- monetizing shouldn&#x27;t be that hard. I hope. And I&#x27;m guessing that&#x27;s what the investors hope too. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if Medium turns out to be one of the first &quot;native digital&quot; publishers -- embracing the strengths of digital distribution, rather than fighting it. Eg: maybe people <i>are</i> willing to pay for content, and one can simply rid oneself of the dependency on advertising.<p>We&#x27;ll see.",1443484710

See the stats on the amount of hard drugs guaranteed to destroy your world we consume? See that person cheating? See that DA wanting a win?<p>If you want a burger, a high, an orgasm or a conviction, you generally will get it at some price that&#x27;s ultimately...above market.<p>How much more prone to excess is someone in the heat of a moment? How unlike the event does its moment by moment reconstruction during a trial appear? The mismatch has always struck me as unjust. As people judging an event whose experience they haven&#x27;t had and haven&#x27;t attempted to recreate. Though a jury is a good idea and the best we&#x27;ve got, the process they run through seems ripe for reform.<p>An eye for an eye has its place. If you walk into a school, start shooting and are captured alive - I think you just forfeited any claim on life or potential rehabilitation.<p>Any shade of grey zooming out from that seems too hard for any government system to decide well. I hear people say things in passing like &quot;he only got 20 years&quot;. 20 years is a huge and devastating amount of time, as is one year. As we&#x27;ve ramped up the time on these sentences and made it an all or nothing proposition. Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t think 20 years will do it if 1 year hasn&#x27;t and I don&#x27;t think death will do it if 20 years hasn&#x27;t.<p>Regarding Richard Glossip. I don&#x27;t know him or his case. I don&#x27;t know the victim and while they won&#x27;t return, there&#x27;s a debt owed that I don&#x27;t know how to pay. I want Richard Glossip to live.

PR is a concern, but not much more than PR in any other spill. The largest problem is spill damages will cost an order of magnitude more to prevent/stop/clean because the arctic is so remote and all effort there is less efficient.<p>PR is not the only cost of the Deepwater Horizon. BP also paid a significant fraction of their market cap to clean up the wide-reaching effects of the spill.<p>There are behavioral costs.  Everyone knows _which_ major oil company was to blame for letting a drunk ship captain navigate the Valdez oil tanker. I was in grade school at the time and I still remember the images of birds, fish, and other wildlife caked in oil slowly dying and the name of the oil company was forever etched into my mind next to those images.<p>The Arctic is some of the most inhospitable weather in the world. Everything costs more to develop, transport, and maintain there. The seasonal weather prevents ships from making the trip there without an ice breaker escort (or more than one if the ice breaker is stranded on ice). The energy required to perform much of the work (keeping machines above freezing temperatures, keeping oil/gas warm to transport in pipelines) isn&#x27;t insignificant. Oil platforms may need to be re-engineered to withstand the weather and floating ice sheets.<p>The costs associated with drilling are high until the drillers find the largest pockets.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that Royal Dutch Shell is among the only major oil companies that actively and openly admits that climate change is an issue, that people are at least partly to blame, and that the oil/energy companies have a responsibility to both factor in the risk factors as well as work on mitigating the contributions of oil/gas to climate change.[1]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/environment/climate-change.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shell.com/global/environment-society/environment/...</a>",1443484592

Perhaps you could say that highly stateful apps running on a single machine can use state encapsulated in objects.<p>In contrast, for web UIs and their &quot;big data&quot; back ends, I believe you also want to use a data-oriented approach, rather than a code-oriented approach (or at least this is the style that my code has converged upon).  You don&#x27;t need to wrap everything up in objects all the time when you&#x27;re really just passing strings through the network and doing light processing.  And when you&#x27;re not even using a type-safe language to begin with.<p>But he&#x27;s advocating the same style on games, just with structs and functions rather than buffers and processes.  This makes me think OOP is more of a mistake, although I will admit that I use objects as modules now (a longer conversation, but the idea is to instantiate almost all your objects at startup, and not allocate during normal program flow).<p>I&#x27;ve long thought there was this interesting historical oddity in that we came up with languages in the 90&#x27;s and designed them for GUIs, but we&#x27;re using them the 2010&#x27;s for web and server programming.  Then you get web apps that are a mess of misleading objects, when really the architecture is stateless (or stored in a database, which is not programmable using your language).",1443484571

If you do need code early on, I think it&#x27;s fine to write it as quickly as possible, even ignoring edge cases and simplifying algorithms.<p>If you have good data structure design (and understand the invariants) and you understand the problem space well from a functional standpoint (including functional edge cases), you can get the code into shape later.

Google&#x27;s just playing catch-up with ad targeting features that Facebook has had for years. Nobody is targeting individual users. There are HUGE amounts of depersonalization work and legal review that go into making something like this a reality. If you think Google&#x27;s engineers spent more time developing this than Google&#x27;s legal team spent approving it, you&#x27;re probably wrong.<p>Say a company wants to target ads to people that are in their email subscription list. Or a brick-and-mortar retailer wants to marry up their in-store customers with online data to target in-store shoppers with online advertising. These are features that have been supported for a while through Facebook and through third-party services like Liveramp. Google is building the infrastructure to support these natively. It&#x27;s not a new technology. It&#x27;s a very old one - what used to be called database marketing back in the days of direct mail and catalogs.<p>Granted, I make my living in marketing, so I may be biased, but I think a lot of folks are looking at this the wrong way. More targeted advertising is less annoying, not more. (A) You aren&#x27;t getting spammed with things that are irrelevant to you. The ads you are shown are more likely to be related to something you actually care about or could potentially want to buy. (B) Advertisers don&#x27;t have to spend as much money on targeted ads as they used to have to spend spamming the world with untargeted advertising (see also TV, radio, sponsorship & endorsement deals, etc), so their margins go up and they can afford better product development, lower prices, etc.<p>The risks here are that you will somehow be outed as someone that shops frequently at a particular store, not that you&#x27;re going to be &quot;spearfished&quot; or that the NSA will send drones to your house to kill you with missiles.",1443484309

They can&#x27;t be broken arbitrarily, which is why innocent people are put to death. Not because we&#x27;re mean. Not because we&#x27;re stupid. We make the rules, and we have to enforce them. In this case, one of our rules is, if you do X, you die.<p>So, if you don&#x27;t believe in killing innocent people, by all means, get rid of that rule.

The interview questions were great: straight on point and no trickery that tries to measure some &quot;ability to ask questions and clarify requirement&quot;. The interviewer didn&#x27;t get bored half way of the interview (and actually do try to understand what you&#x27;re doing). The process was quick, Harj was very responsive in answering questions and resolving any issue.<p>Technical-wise, I like the idea of having multiple questions of different types to choose from: I live half way in Lisp land so recursion isn&#x27;t a problem to me. But I don&#x27;t do much concurrency except actor model so a lot of programmers will do better than me in writing thread-safe code etc. I think it also helps that they do enough interviews to pick out good problems: it&#x27;s generic enough to be solved by (reasonable) general knowledge of programming. Too often I&#x27;ve seen interviewer in companies forgetting that algorithm is much like puzzle: you look like genius if you&#x27;ve seen it before, and an idiot if you haven&#x27;t.<p>Rationally speaking, as a recruiting firm their incentives align with the candidate. But Triplebyte seems to optimize their automate/basic filter and process enough to deal and treat every candidate with reasonable effort from their part. Normally, it gets really annoying real quick when you realize that the interviewer is looking for any excuse to cross you off the list -- which unfortunately happens way too often.<p>I hope they will be able to scale it up.

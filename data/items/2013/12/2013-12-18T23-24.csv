There are no arbitrary definitions of what a winning analysis is. There is no ciphertext to break or keys to recover. We are simply rewarding the most successful cryptanalysis research result, whatever it may be and however successful it is (or is not). Again, the contest is fair because 1) the algorithm is completely specified, 2) there are no arbitrary definition of what winning means, and 3) the algorithm is public domain.</i><p>This Telegram contest may seem superficially similar to that fair contest, but it differs in some important ways. First, this contest isn&#x27;t rewarding &quot;best effort&quot;.  Second, this contest doesn&#x27;t meet those criteria, because their central server isn&#x27;t being tested here.  The goal of a product like Telegram is to defend against adversaries like governments, and hence governments will be able to probe their servers for weaknesses.  You may say that we, too, can do the same, but if that&#x27;s the case, a test server should be made available and the contest should explicitly try to get as many people as possible to break it.<p>This contest is interesting, but it&#x27;s too artificial.  As just one example of why that&#x27;s the case: breaking real-world crypto often relies on side channel attacks, for instance timing attacks, and there&#x27;s no opportunity of employing those attacks here due to the artificial nature of the contest.<p>Once again, if people here are interested in a secure alternative to Telegram that doesn&#x27;t rely on public stunts for cryptanalysis, then check out TextSecure.  It was designed by cryptographers, is open-source, and has been studied in detail for years.   <a href=\"https://whispersystems.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://whispersystems.org/</a><p>EDIT:  It appears Telegram is also vulnerable to MITM attacks.  This is the NSA&#x27;s preferred method of gathering info, so this is the most likely attack vector against Telegram.  Due to the design of the protocol, there seems to be no defense.  <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931892\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931892</a><p>Telegram&#x27;s response is &quot;we protect against this because if you&#x27;ve initiated a secret chat previously, then you&#x27;re protected.&quot;  However, this isn&#x27;t true. 1) a global adversary like the NSA can (and will, if they become interested in Telegram) simply MITM every secret chat session when they&#x27;re first initiated; therefore if you use Telegram, you should assume the government has your data anyway, since this protocol offers no protection against mass snooping. 2) Secret chats aren&#x27;t even the default type of chat in Telegram anyway, making it very unlikely that users will be protected by it.  The defaults need to be secure.<p>References:<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931892\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931892</a><p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931961\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931961</a> (Telegram&#x27;s response, which seems to verify that secret chats can be MITM&#x27;d on first initiation.)<p><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931903\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6931903</a> (Demonstrates that Telegram seems to be misunderstanding why someone breaking into the central server can MITM your chats.)",1387411094

Instead, they delivered coins paid for at $800+ at today&#x27;s prices (~$500).

6931910,comment,6931217,6931769,1,0,baddox,,,"> People tend to think that some level of taxation is necessary, because they think that some government functions are necessary. That&#x27;s different than &quot;lving taxes&quot; in a general sense.<p>I simply disagree. I think most people believe that without taxation (i.e. without forcefully taking funds from people who aren&#x27;t willing to give, even if that&#x27;s only a small portion of the tax base), many things which are generally considered good (like care for the poor, infrastructure, public defense, etc.) simply cannot exist. To me, that is equivalent to &quot;loving taxes.&quot;<p>Granted, the word &quot;love&quot; is a very complex and vague one, so perhaps I should have phrased it differently, like &quot;people are intensely thankful for government.&quot;<p>> but I&#x27;ve never encountered anyone that both viewed themselves as completely dependent on government for anything that did not resent that complete dependence, nor have I seen many people that show any signs of feeling completely dependent on government for welfare or security.<p>I hear it quite often. My father believes very sincerely that military conscription is a <i>great</i> thing, because without it no region of people could hope to survive due to the threat of invasion and attack. People are also gratefully dependent on simpler things like food and drug regulations, public transportation, and even government postal services. I think most people sincerely believe that, without government, there is no way to have a stable, thriving, &quot;civilized&quot; society. I have even often heard people say things like &quot;without government, we are just apes beating each other to death with sticks.&quot;<p>Honestly, apart from the people I have met (mostly online) who are explicitly against the existence of the state (who are obviously in a tiny minority), I don&#x27;t know of anyone who doesn&#x27;t think of government as <i>the</i> most fundamental and primary cause for the enjoyability of modern society.",1387410958

Bitcoin may very well be a complete failure, or a flawed idea, or practically against its own goals, or whatever you want. And that would actually be an interesting article to read. But why must it be necessary to then further portray those honestly interested in it as delusional or perhaps downright malicious?<p>The idea that macro economics is &quot;figured out&quot; has been debunked countless times. Both sides can cherry-pick examples ad-infinitum and call the other side ridiculous. Anyone who thinks they firmly <i>know</i> &quot;why&quot; a certain recession happened is suffering from ignorance of their own ignorance in my opinion. Clearly something isn&#x27;t working right today if 2008 happened, and not to mention how the very economic policies we consider so great for us here domestically often have incredibly ill effects on third world countries. It&#x27;s a hard, complex problem, and I&#x27;ve frankly given up on solutions that <i>require</i> as a premise that everyone else shut up and do exactly what you say.<p>Perhaps you believe that social problems can&#x27;t be solved through technology. That is an acceptable and even admirable belief, but why should that stop me from having a different belief? One of the nice things about our society is that different people can try different strategies. Some people think that the way to reduce car deaths or prevent drunk driving (a clear <i>social</i> problem) is through education and stricter laws. Honest and valuable social strategy. However, others think you can accomplish it technologically by making cars that drive themselves and avoiding the problem altogether. There&#x27;s no reason we can&#x27;t try both and not politically demonize the other side (I&#x27;d remind you that suggesting a car that drives itself in the 50s as a solution to drunk driving would have probably had you labeled a nut -- that doesn&#x27;t mean we should have hung any AI researchers out to dry for working on the beginnings of such a system).<p>The worst part about this is how he immediately considers anyone who believes in this as removed from reality. Why assume the worst of people you clearly have not met all of. I don&#x27;t know OP&#x27;s past, but I can tell you that my parents are from foreign country that has experienced hyperinflation in a very real way. Many of my feelings are a result of this: precisely because I feel hyperinflation is <i>more real</i> to me (and obviously more real to my parents) than someone whose entire family is from the United States and has only ever heard about it as a curiosity from Zimbabwe that they can refer to at a cocktail party. I see hyperinflation as a real problem -- just because it doesn&#x27;t happen in the US doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t exist or is a fantasy. I very much believe that BTC offers the first real alternative for people trapped in countries where they can&#x27;t get USD in or out during these events. And yes, this may mean it would circumvent that country&#x27;s regulations: but even if you think the US government is doing things for the betterment of its population, I can guarantee you that&#x27;s not the case everywhere else. Now you may disagree and think the right strategy is a different one involving the UN or the World Bank perhaps. That&#x27;s fine, but please don&#x27;t extrapolate that into a personal judgement of my character.",1387410563

6931846,comment,6931217,6931777,3,0,kevingadd,,,"Technically the only way Bitcoin can threaten the <i>very rich</i> is if it directly undermines the value of their assets. How exactly will it do that if, right now, any one of them can sink a huge amount of USD into amassing a Bitcoin stockpile (either by buying lots of ASICs or buying them directly)? There are literal examples of this already - the Winklevoss twins have claimed to own over 1% of all Bitcoins, effectively converting some of their massive USD wealth into BTC. Even if you were to undermine the existing monetary systems, any rich person that saw it coming would easily be able to amass a giant BTC stockpile and ride it out. In that scenario, they would not stand to lose very much in a BTC transition, as long as they saw it coming before USD&#x27;s value was completely destroyed.<p>The &#x27;very rich&#x27; can afford to spend extravagantly to acquire bitcoins, and can afford to do so at &#x27;a loss&#x27; if they actually have some good reason to convert money from other currencies to BTC. The average poor or middle-class person who has bitcoins to sell will be unlikely to turn down an offer to buy BTC at above market prices or similar other arrangements.<p>You <i>can</i> argue that Bitcoin is a threat to the <i>revenue streams</i> that the &#x27;very rich&#x27; rely on to become wealthy and stay wealthy; however, it is mostly a threat in that it displaces those revenue streams. Speculators that currently work in things tied to USD can just as easily do their speculation against BTC; you do nothing to put those people out of work. Investors, likewise, are not somehow directly threatened by a Bitcoin-based economy. It&#x27;s just currency to them.",1387410401

As a startup founder, you are the house.  You are trying to attract players who will place a bet.  If your startup is a good bet you want to attract poker players who will play against each other and bet big based on the odds.  If your startup is a bad bet, you want to attract roulette players who will play against the odds and bet against you.<p>Good poker players play based on statistics and pot odds.  They want to bet the same way they would if they had all of the information in front of them and could calculate that the exact odds are in their favor.  If you have a great startup, a.k.a. a favorable hand/game for making an educated bet, you want to show as much information as possible and attract poker players.  It&#x27;s okay to let dummies play, too, as long as they&#x27;re not reckless drunks, and you have nothing to lose in showing them all of the available information, too.  And the winning outcome is when your poker playing investors win their hand, and tip you big as the dealer.<p>If the odds are stacked against your company, you need to deceive players into thinking you&#x27;re a good bet or attract players who don&#x27;t know any better.  That requires either hiding information or, worse, bluffing.  Roulette players have the odds stacked against them and are just gambling, either because they believe in getting lucky or lack the ability to play a game of skill.  So, if you have a bad startup, you&#x27;re trying to attract gamblers and give them less information so that they think they have a chance of winning even though it&#x27;s a long shot.<p>Basically, you&#x27;re not playing poker against the investors.  You&#x27;re just trying to attract players.  The kind of players you want depends on the game you&#x27;re offering.  If your game is a good one that educated players can make money at, give them all of the information.  If your game is stacked against the players, attract drunkards and don&#x27;t tell them how bad their odds are.",1387410247

There is only one cause for market irrationality and inflation: human greed.<p>The government has the job of trying to shape society. Deciding that home ownership is a good thing and giving people tax breaks isn&#x27;t the same as telling people to buy houses that cost more than they can afford. Encouraging people to go to college doesn&#x27;t mean that harvard should charge 100X what they charged fifty years ago. It&#x27;s the role of government to provide incentives and penalties. It&#x27;s the unfortunate role of the market to pervert and distort those things to maximize profit at the expense of society.<p>It&#x27;s easy to think of regulators as some Other that has come in and destroyed our economic eden. The fact of the matter is that things were significantly worse for everyone before we had government regulation. Inflation [1] and economic bubbles [2] existed before the modern financial system. Price gouging, monopolies, child labor exploitation...all reduced by government regulation.<p>We may not agree on the role of government, but it doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense to use them as a boogeyman that is responsible for all of society&#x27;s economic ills. The idea that mankind was in a perfect state of nature before modern government borders on being religious.

It does <i>not</i> violate any laws of physics (or thermodynamics). Using petrol to make petrol this way is not effective since the translation leaves you will less petrol than you started with. Using power supplied by a nuclear reaction (as an example) to make petrol this way will convert locally generated nuclear power into transportable &quot;chemical&quot; aka &quot;petrol&quot; power. As most of the energy in the fischer-tropsch process is heat you can use concentrated solar just as easily. the electrical energy used is primarily in running the cooling pumps. Given that &quot;oil&quot; (and from oil, petrol) can be made out of renewable feedstock (CO and H2), I claim we won&#x27;t ever &quot;run out&quot;.<p>The economic principle I was alluding too was substitution, where an equally effective good at lower cost replaces a good at higher cost in the market. If petrol is $10/liter, cars powered by electricity will replace cars powered by petrol. That is an economic substitution of equal function at a lower cost.<p>On the Algae process. At least the NASA version required much less heat and cooling the the fischer-tropsch process and in the NASA case no arable farmland (you can grow algae in clear tubes bolted to the sides of buildings if you want). Providing yet another alternative to acquiring long chain hydrocarbons that are more cost effective to create than using a nuclear reactor connected to a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The challenge of algae systems has been capturing a low marginal cost of additional oil from a process that was not continuous (you want to make a gallon you pay the cost of running the cycle for 1,000 gallons regardless). If however you can make a gallon for the marginal cost of producing an extra few gallons of algage scum, then you can amortize your costs more effectively and carry less risk. Both of these things encourage adoption and production.<p>Is that clearer? And for the record I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve changed my argument at all here, just filling in the bits which you might have missed.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_process\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer-Tropsch_process</a>",1387410025

The monetary policy of Bitcoin is not set in stone; it is in fact controlled by a quorum of the existing mining capacity.<p>If Bitcoin becomes popular with the general populace, however, at some point a large enough coalition of actors <i>will</i> emerge who can adjust monetary policy to their advantage -- specifically, by increasing block rewards, making their hardware more valuable.  The incentives actively encourage this manipulation in the long term, and the group to which the incentives apply (mining hardware owners) are precisely the group empowered to do the manipulation.<p>There are only two things preventing this from happening right now:  first, many hardware owners are either in it for the ideology or have substantial speculative positions in Bitcoin that would be endangered by manipulation of monetary policy, and second, that such a shift in monetary policy would discourage adoption (after all, this is one of the purported benefits of Bitcoin).  Both of these impediments go away with widespread adoption.<p>Government central banks may do this now, sure, but they generally have a <i>little</i> more accountability than an anonymous coalition of hardware owners.",1387409488

I think bittorrent-like &#x27;success&#x27; (&#x27;failure&#x27; if you prefer) is the worst-case scenario for bitcoin barring any flaws in the crypto.<p>The unbanked stand the most to gain from bitcoin.  There are many, many reasons why people are unbanked, but by and large it is because they are poor and in poor economies.  Sometimes it&#x27;s because they owe banks money (as is the case for most unbanked in the usa).  It seems to me self-evident how bitcoin impacts the unbanked.. they can now receive money where before they couldn&#x27;t.  There is no legal framework or local institution necessary to create a bitcoin wallet.  You just do it with maths.  I have personally sent bitcoin to an unbanked friend (owed money for years to a bank from an overdraft charge and enver dealt with it) who was able to get cash for it in a pinch.

He seem sto strongly imply that it is dumb, stupid, overhyped, etc etc; but stops short of actually making any type of reality-prediction.<p>I think cryptocurrencies are here to stay; bitcoin&#x27;s likely, but im less &quot;certain&quot; of that.  High valuation?  Well.. eventually; but again that may end up being spread out across many cryptos rather than just bitcoin, but I do think it is about 100x as likely that bitcoin gets to 10k than 0.  I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say that it is obvious this is all true; but if you ask what I think, then yes.. I do think it is a &#x27;foregone&#x27; conclusion that cryptocurrency will acheive s-curve adoption.  Of course these things are not prove-able; and I don&#x27;t have a crystal ball.. but distributed consensus to a limited digital asset is the perfect avenue for money.  It clicked for me the first moment I read about it in 2010; and it clicked for many others in the same way.  Other&#x27;s took more convincing.  I see about a 1000-1 ratio of people who go from thinking bitcoin is trash to believing in cryptocurrencies vs the other-way around.

Transactions take place that enable it to function. Also, there is an interface between intra and public blockchains. If your department wants pens, it must buy it internally from the Supplies department. At some point Supplies converts its intracoins to public cash or coins (with management approval^) to buy more pens. You work for intra-coins, and at some point you convert it to cash or public coins. Not sure if the overhead of these micro-transactions are worth it, on the other hand, conglomerates of companies could exist. But the intra-coins have real value, because management will convert them to proper cash or public cryptocoins. The key is making sure an employee can&#x27;t just cash out with intra-coins somewhere else and quit.<p>^ the key here is that things can be monitored and controlled on a sped-up blockchain, while still allowing a market mechanism to take place. Perhaps pens isn&#x27;t the best example, more like certain factors of production.<p>The more I think about it, the more useful this seems to be. Especially attaching notes to transactions, and mining all coins instantly, and management dishing them out as needed. Perhaps creating more if needed. If the company is running low on cash, it can adjust the exchange rate, so the coins are worth less. If the company is doing well, the value of the coins goes up. This also gives the firm incentive to do well and be efficient, especially if staff are paid in intra-coins.<p>Companies have intranets, why not intracoins?",1387408104

I&#x27;ve been following bitcoin for a couple of years, and this year when my friends/family started talking like that I was a bit disheartened. To be fair, If I heard something along the lines of &quot;using bitcoin to obtain resources that are hard/ more insecure using traditional means/trust models&quot;, my eyes would have lit up.<p>It seems like all the voices around speculating price points in fiat have been drowning out those of utility (of course, this is not limited to just bitcoins), though those who find it&#x27;s utility still trudge on.<p>Right now, I&#x27;m interested in the interactions around the exchange process because I think that&#x27;s where the trust model applauded by many (myself included), is at its weakest. It would be pretty cool if there were some kind of platform built into/on top of a bitcoin client that allowed for a peer to peer exchange where maybe using the current banking system in some way, users could escrow/deposit/withdraw fiat into the network (using the network as a ledger that associates fiat amounts with addresses maybe with something like prepaid debit cards).

Everyone pays worse prices--even people who don&#x27;t get the benefit! We&#x27;re letting companies rather than the government levy an effective tax, with the benefit only going to their customers! Patently absurd.<p>Moreover, the credit card companies are a gigantic oligopoly. There is a bare handful of gigantic companies controlling the entire market. This is almost inevitable because there is such a high barrier to entry thanks to major infrastructure and regulatory requirements.<p>BitCoin alleviates these barriers, especially the infrastructure. This means it is much easier to process payments, and much easier to establish services on the side for things like arbitration or fraud prevention. Instead of tying fraud prevention and arbitration to a few companies, we can create a market of many smaller arbitration services à la BitRated, which lets anyone offer an arbitration service. This creates a more flexible and liquid arbitration situation and lets me, as a consumer, display different preferences.<p>I don&#x27;t want to say anything about other aspects of BitCoin right now, but decoupling arbitration from payment processing seems to be a net win.<p>I&#x27;m not sure the technology is there right now, but I imagine it would be possible to have a similar third-party system for preventing fraudulent spending. You could have a company that monitors all the transactions from a wallet and can block any given transaction if it looks suspicious. Moreover, they would not be able to <i>withdraw</i> anything themselves, and you could probably retain some sort of cold back-door--a key on a piece of paper or something like that.<p>BitCoin gives us the pieces to put this together.

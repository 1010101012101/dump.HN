People might then choose to, rather than starting that social media website that will change the world or hacking together that 'cool' project for Maker Faire, study computer science and take a job at Microsoft Research, PARC or SpaceX.<p>Or something else.<p>But any behavior that reduces the extent to which people think about their actions is probably bad.",1359780663

It wouldn't work.<p>So I return your your argument: you sebcat insensitive clod, how comes you're not willing to spend $ 1 000 000 000 000 per person per year so that everyone has a better health-care, you really have no heart!?<p>So any discussion about ""health-care"" is pointless: it's not about no health-care at all or a super-good healthcare.

It's all words and intellectual terrorism.<p>But as soon as you use their own arguments against themselves, they're dodging the question.<p>Now every single time I discuss with a socialo-commie I use that $1 000 000 000 per person per year example and I ask him if it's sustainable or not.

Maybe with a different business model, but from the cost analysis I've seen, SodaStream comes in at about $0.40/L, which is a little over half of what Coke and Pepsi cost, but the cost of Coke and Pepsi is about 50% branding anyway. A fair comparison would be generic sodas, which are are closer to $0.50/L. So you're only saving about 20%, even though you've cut out the cost of bottling water, warehousing it, and shipping it around the country (aka, most of the actual cost of soda).<p>Which is to say that the SodaStream is a rip-off. They lock you into buying their proprietary CO2 tanks (which are specially threaded so you can't shop around), so it's sort of a similar business model to printers or razors. Except, of course, that you can actually build a DIY carbonation system for not much more than the cost of the SodaStream fountain itself (and it's not a difficult build; you just have to connect some hoses to some off-the-shelf parts, and you can find plenty of guides on the internet).",1359780145

For some things, for some people, at some points in time, an app can help bridge that gap. For example, you could write a volunteer version of Exec where people in your community just, I don't know, <i>ask for help</i> and then someone nearby <i>gives them help</i>.

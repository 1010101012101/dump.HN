8313346,comment,8312329,8312329,9,0,nthj,,,"This is because our society has conflated education with acquiring skills which can be used to create value. What do we tell our young people? “Get good grades, so you can go to college, get a degree, and get a good job.”<p>Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong: being well educated has many benefits to both society as a whole and to any given individual. A great education is a wonderful thing to acquire and very valuable.<p>But when we tell our young people, “just get the best grades you can and stick it out until you have a piece of paper”—we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when they don&#x27;t have skills they can trade in the free market for the income they want. (You can argue whether this /should/ be the case, but I&#x27;m not arguing what should be, only what reality currently is.)<p>I was fortunate enough to realize this several years ago, in large part thanks to Hacker News, PG&#x27;s writings on creating wealth, and Jason Fried&#x27;s Inc Magazine article on making money [1]. But I only found these resources indirectly because I happened to be excited by programming while in high school—not because my school counselors, parents, or society as a whole was pushing me in this direction.<p>Living life well requires balancing many things: work, family, learning, hobbies, helping others. I don&#x27;t have an easy answer to that. But I do think we need to stop glossing over the whole making-money-is-a-skill thing. It&#x27;s not doing our young people any good. They need to spend their early years both acquiring a great education, and learning marketable skills. And we need to ask them those hard questions before they turn 25, graduate, and suddenly wonder how they&#x27;re going make it in the real world. Otherwise, the trend outlined in the article will only continue.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-business-advice-from-jason-fried.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inc.com/magazine/20110301/making-money-small-busi...</a>",1410637230

If they did, then they would be wise not to mention the numerous SCADA faults found in Siemens control systems. There is absolutely no way you would roll out a system like that and have every industrial product line using it. So I am little puzzled by your claim.<p>The thing about these systems is they attempt to prevent you from shooting your own foot by not letting you aim. Some operations (such as erasing and writing flash) require you to do dangerous things like relocating code to SRAM and running from there while your flash operation completes. The details of each platform vary: ARM code is generated in a position dependent fashion; MSP430 is not.<p>I am certainly not calling C the end-all be all, but it&#x27;s a tough system to beat.

Once you&#x27;ve painted enough, you learn to realize what colors are in the scene but not quite obvious.  You definitely exaggerate the colors (&quot;hint of pink&quot; becomes &quot;pink streaks&quot;) while painting in this style, but it also forces you to think harder about what colors your eye actually sees.<p>So it seems to me that impressionist-style coloring can definitely come from &quot;faking it&quot; (being taught it, and trying hard), but I would definitely believe it could come from tetrachromism, where those small differences stick out to you a lot.

Last time I looked, e.g. the New Relic agent would crash if you tried to run it under Java 8 - whereas it will profile your Play transactions just fine.<p>Popularity is a lagging indicator. The tooling is there already, quite frankly - we see first-class support for Scala in new efforts like Takipi. Jobs are what you make them - more than once I&#x27;ve taken a Java job and turned it into a Scala job.

I searched and found my birth family single handedly back in 1976 (before the internet) and have helped reunited many families.  Compiling a book on the Kerrville Folk Festival as I am very involved in the folk music community here in Austin, Texas.  My nickname in my younger years was ""TB"" for tenacious bitch.  I don't let go, I achieve my goals.<p>Problem:   I decided to go back to school to obtain a Bachelors degree and then pursue a Masters, possibly in nursing.  Since I have accumulated over 130 hours in nursing, criminal justice, sociology and psychology, I wanted a degree plan which would accept the majority of my credits and require the least amount of coursework to be awarded a Bachelors.  I spent hours and hours pouring over individual college websites comparing my transcripts with their prereqs, degree plan requirements, etc.<p>My thought is that there are a multitude of people in my situation, especially now with the economy, many people are returning to school in order to improve their employment prospects.<p>Idea:  A website where a user registers, enters their transcript information, coursework numbers, etc and selects colleges which fit their requirements; online, physical location, private, public, etc.  The program filters through all the degree plans and outputs a list of colleges, degree plans, lists which courses on their transcripts would be accepted and what further courses would be required to complete the degree plans. This enables the user to choose the path of least resistance in order to complete their degree.<p>Setup:   User registration is free, college, university, training program registrations are free.  Ad space sold to colleges, universities, training programs, loan programs, book stores, apartment locators, etc  Could be tethered to online communities such as facebook, etc.<p>Need:  Partner or Partners to bring this to fruition.  While the computer partner/s are building the program, I would be building relationships, obtaining funding, etc.  Would prefer someone here in Austin and second choice would be Kitakyushu Japan because I lived there for a year as a child and would like to return for a visit.  Really anywhere is fine, but if I don't tell the Universe what I want, how will it know what to deliver?<p>Other:  Please send me a message if you are interested and/or if you see the obvious problems to this idea which I, as a non computer person haven't realized because I don't know what I don't know.<p>Thanks!",1311605470

Its depressing that the country stands almost a week away from a technical default that will likely result in the loss of over 1m jobs and 1.0% of GDP growth.  Its a shame that partisan divisions in Congress have created such uncertainty.  Washington D.C. seems incapable of cooperation and collaboration.<p>Many political scientists have long dreamed of American parties that were more ideologically pure and coherent (similar to European parties).  Todays political environment is a realization of this dream - and unfortunately, its terrible.  The fact is that America does not have a parliamentary system of government, in which one party controls the executive and legislative levers of power.  Power in the U.S. is more balanced, requiring a cooperative approach to governing.  Political parties must work together to get anything done.  For a variety of reasons, cooperation has been absent from any political negotiations recently.  Our government has been paralyzed by the intransigence of Republicans AND Democrats.

For example take a look at the history of the early automobile industry in Detroit.  The founders of the early car companies were for the most part people like Henry Ford - engineers, mechanics, and other people who knew the technology rather than management types.  Silicon Valley fits the mold of previous startup hubs.<p>The more major mistake is that Genetech's IPO in 1980 is cited for getting researchers involved in commercialization.  However most observers cite the Bayh-Dole act in the same year as being the critical factor.  It gave organizations such as universities the right to intellectual property (such as patents) arising out of research funded by the US government.  This created a tremendous number of opportunities for commercializing research that simply had not existed previously.",1311605099

2802764,comment,2800955,2800955,1,0,tete,,,"tl;dr: My theory is that creativity is - or at least is related to - the ability to express yourself. So you usually have _some_ creativity and you most likely can train it.<p>In my opinion and I spent a long time on this topic creativity is something completely different. The reason I spent so much time thinking about creativity is that I don't consider myself to be a very creative person. So I wondered what causes this lack. I considered a lot of things until I came to the conclusion that creativity is a form of expression, which means that creativity describe the ability to express ""stuff"". In most cases it's about emotions.<p>The outcome of creativity is usually considered to be art. Think about something you consider to defiantly be art, for example a book or music. What is it about or what makes it art? Yes I know, it's another term that can be very hard to describe, but one can deny that art is generally related to some kind of emotion or the absence of emotion. It's also why art often provokes.<p>So creativity _probably_ (it's all just a personal theory) means expressing yourself, so learning to express yourself means becoming more creative. It also means that as long you can in some way express yourself, especially your emotions you are creative, maybe not very creative, but you are.<p>I think this can also be backed by science. Humans, as (generally speaking) social species depend a lot on expressing themselves. They aren't like ants for example, with a relatively small scope of action. They are very individual and so it is important to understand emotions and express their own ones. If this isn't the case it's considered to be a sign of a mental  illness. I guess that's also why people with mental illnesses receive a therapy where they do something creative (usually drawing) and why most artists are usually very emotional. Some of them also mention that their main reason for creating art is a psychologically.<p>Last, but not least their are hackers (the ones at the CCC and not necessarily intruders) who usually have a deep emotional commitment to the work they are doing. I think it's probably also related to geeks, who often play role playing games and when you think about science fiction stuff and things like Commander Data and Mr. Spock it's also a lot about emotions.<p>By the way, there is also emotional intelligence which might be related to this, but I'm not a psychologist, so I don't know a lot about this.",1311604610

Try correlating my name (Michael Roberts) with <i>anything</i> just by name.  It can't be done.  There are an estimated 5589 Michael Robertses in the US (howmanyofme.com) and several of us in any given town.  And my legal first name is actually James, so you can't correlate that with airline reservations anyway (thanks so very much, TSA).<p>No, Google really didn't think this through here.  And the ""hoo-ha"" (I'm not sure that means what you think it means) is about more than that.  It's about a ToS that says ""use the name your friends know you by"" - often a pseudonym.  Google will still delete your account with no recourse.<p>(This even omits the real-world examples of people who don't fit Google's Anglo naming assumptions - the real world really does consist of about 20% impossible hacks, and you'd think Google, <i>of all companies</i>, would get that, but they seem not to.)<p>Of course, Google's famous omission of any discernible customer service or appeals process only plays into this even more.<p>No, it's a trainwreck.  Google is responding well, and it's true it's still actually a beta - but pseudonymity is important, and the ability to correlate with banking records is broken anyway.  So why stick with it?",1311603202

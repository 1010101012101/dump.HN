The fact I'm instantly down my CC info and $60 on three purchases is some incredibly convincing concept validation for myself, but the potential here, both in terms of impact and unique experiences, is unimaginably cool.<p>One important thing to note, you need to make your referral codes and messaging (i.e. refer a friend and you both win) more prominent. I told my friend about the site and when he asked me for a referral code, I had no clue what he was talking about, since apparently you don't get a referral code if you sign up in the purchase flow and I had to sign up with a secondary fake account to see what the deal was. So you probably want to:<p>1) Make the referral code actually accessible on the account page (It currently isn't there at all? Unless I'm in some n-way test?)<p>2) Make the referral code available on every completed transaction. Personally, I'd also recommend tossing in that cute turtle that appears during signup :)<p>3) Send the referral code, and whole welcome email, for that matter, to the user if they come in through the payment flow.<p>4) Add an entry on how to find your personal referral code in the FAQ.<p>Given the empirical success of such tactics (PayPal especially comes to mind) and especially given that many people will want to enjoy these experiences with their friends, you really want to make sure the user is aware of the promotion. Obviously, there are some considerations regarding the cost as you give out $10 and make less than 12% back after fees, but if you're going to run it on the traditional sign-up flow, you might as well put it everywhere. Especially since people who sign up via the purchase flow or make a purchase would be much more likely to refer their friends, since they've already validated the service.<p>Anyways, congratulations on the launch.

I do know exactly what they are, and am not from the US, or France, both of which see them slightly differently than here, the UK. But that's irrelevant. I agree with you about correct attribution. Note that misleading attribution is really not so bad. People lie all the time, and where lies cause damage, we have laws in place for that - e.g. contractual misrepresentation/negligent misstatement, fraud, libel. Why add a super-powerful moral right, capable of reaching through space and time, and activateable at your wish, for all of time (I assume if you want that right to be enforceable, you're saying it should be assignable to someone after your death, and theirs, ad infinitum)?<p>You forget that every citizen with a computer (including a smartphone) is now a publisher. Copyright law is very, very complex, and that's fine if it only affected professional publishers, as it once did, and helped create a market capable of self-regulating copying. But all of that has changed, hugely, now. Are you really considering my moral rights when you cite my post in the one you just published?<p>Furthermore, copyright is a bundle of rights that reaches through space and time to control how people communicate, and also how your digital devices (your own property) can interact (DRM, region controls, etc). For it to exist, we have to sacrifice, for the copyright term, rights to free communication, to efficient cultural diffusion, cheap education, cheap and simple factual accuracy (since things must be paraphrased, incriminating emails cannot be reproduced, etc). We chose to do that, but our legislators perhaps forgot about that sacrifice every time they extended copyright. Have a read of the economists' amicus curiae brief in Eldred v Ashcroft (supreme court) to see what Coase, Friedman, Arrow, Varian, Akerloff, Buchanan et al thought about just the economic aspect of it (let alone my points just now about nonmarket efficiency and rights to free and efficient speech).<p>>Basically what you're saying is other creators content should be free (libre+gratis) for me because I think what I'm doing is right.

The only issue is if the new column has a default value and you have millions of rows that you need to ""backfill"" but that's just a big transaction; it's nothing remarkable in and of itself, if you could do a transaction that big anyway, you'd just go ahead and do it.

After ignoring common words (e.g. 'a', 'an',  'the' ... ) in a tweet , start assigning some kind of relevance rank to all the other word pairs found in the tweet\n     e.g. its likely that 'Cricket' and 'Sachin' (Or 'NBA' and <top NBA player) will both increase each other's relevance rank, WRT to each-other.<p>3. Process all the tweets like this, while maintaining the output of step 2 in a most suitable data structure. You would also need to start dropping word-pairs (to avoid having the problem of storing Million-C-2 words! ) based on some logic/heuristic.<p>4. If we have a good logic for having reasonably not-big storage (by avoiding the million-c-2 explosion), then what we have is at the end of processing:  A simple look up of a million words, where each word has its 'top' max_allowed(k) semantic words.<p>PS: The most complex piece in the approach is to come out with a solution for dropping word-pairs (in step 3)",1289041797

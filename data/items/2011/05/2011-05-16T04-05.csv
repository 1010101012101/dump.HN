I glanced outside for a minute at the city mist. I could almost taste the grey. I plugged the kettle in and switched it on. As the kettle began to hiss, I looked for biscuits. Anything above loose crumbs would do. Thankfully I found some fusty digestives. For some reason, biscuits are always nicer when they've gone a bit dry and stale. I took the milk out of the fridge and poured some into a cup that I'd left out from having used earlier. The kettle began grumbling fiercely so I took it from the cord, threw a teabag into my cup and poured boiling water onto it. I watched brown swirls rise up through the muted white of milky water. A few minutes passed. I removed and squeezed the teabag, then flicked it into the bin. I picked up my mug and left the kitchen with a nice, hot cup of strong tea.",1305521906

That's set up from the very first precognition and subsequent raid. Agatha sees a murder that does not happen, because there is interevention. The premise underlying the story the filmmakers chose to tell us is that what she sees will in fact occur if we do not stop it. We are free to stop it, of course, but only because we know it is coming. If we didn't know, the world would continue on the rails it has been traveling on, and it would arrive at the destination Agatha has foreseen. This is the essential point that you have to buy into for the premise to work at all.""<p>I dig a little deeper here, including analysis of the eye transplant scene.

Interacting with the scheduler is implicit in eventlet (and gevent, which some prefer) so you write code that looks synchronous.<p>On top of that, you get nonblocking I/O almost for free, similar to what node attempts to provide, where instead of real nonblocking I/O the system will make blocking I/O <i>look</i> like it's nonblocking. Scala does this too.<p>But, users of Twisted could also use inLineCallbacks for a similar feel, though it's not required. I'm curious if Node.js could just build the same?",1305519172

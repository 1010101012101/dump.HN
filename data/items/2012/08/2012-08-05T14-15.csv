4341585,comment,4340641,4341546,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"Brettspielwelt seems cool, but I don't think chat alone quite brings us to being ""social"". For all the ""hardness"" of German-style games (and they're actually not that ""hard"") they're also quite social. That, I think, is the brilliance of the best Eurogames. They're complex enough to deliver interesting play for the high-NFC crowd, but they're simple enough to still be credible social games. They're non-trivial and involve some teaching time, but they're designed to be played by families.<p>Google+ Hangout integration with the German games, and with the well-designed social games like Apples to Apples and Great Dalmuti, and with typical card games (Hearts, Spades, Ambition) would have been totally badass. Not only would it have made online gaming actually social, but it would have given people a reason to use Hangouts (which are cool, but never caught on because they didn't have a draw, and games could have been the draw).<p>What I really wanted was to engage and empower the developer community. Right now, developing a new board game is very hard. You have to print a scrappy prototype and find people willing to play it (play testers). It takes several hundred hours of testing to balance a non-trivial game. This is a major barrier to entry for game development, and in the age of cloud computing and analytics and video chat, there's no excuse for it to be that way. No reason to limit this to German-style board games either; we could have also engaged 2D ""retro"" gamers and eventually supported MMORPGs. We'd probably want to stay away from the forefront of graphics, but no reason we couldn't have delivered excellent game play.<p>But... upper management wanted to give preferential treatment to mainstream publishers, and the result is that Google+ Games flopped.",1344178638

4341573,comment,4340891,4340891,5,0,skue,,,"Most of the comments here talk about additional advantages of Erlang without commenting on the point of the original article -- which is that servers would move towards multi-core systems where Erlang excels. Of course, this hasn't really happened, because we've moved to cloud services instead, which typically offer a single virtual CPU.<p>I'm not arguing against Erlang. It's a great language and folks could certainly choose to run it on their own multi-core system or scale across multiple virtual servers. But startups often pick the technology they can get running with minimal investment, then scale from there: a VPS or two with a single CPU and constrained RAM. So although Erlang might be a great long term investment, it requires a lot of RAM up front and hyped features like multi-core support don't matter as much to young startups choosing technology at the early stages.<p>It would be great to see more discussion about how well Erlang scales across multiple VPS systems -- and not just theoretically, but how many systems you can practically scale across, how it impacts performance, RAM usage, etc. Plus how this would compare to just using an independent messaging queue/bus to accomplish the same thing in another language.",1344178406

I have no clue what the security schemes are for either of those service providers, but if they allow CSRs to change passwords, then it's the same thing.  If the CSRs can be paid off, or fooled over a phone call, then it might be cheaper to just do that if they want to inflict potentially millions of dollars worth of damage to a rival.<p>Having the security of your entire business behind a single CSR or a cell phone is the equivalent of millions of dollars worth of Cisco firewalls being outdone by a $20 wifi-router plugged into the internal network.",1344178289

4341476,comment,4340891,4341130,6,0,jlouis,,,"Here are some ideas for your two problems.<p>First, the problem is sorting. One very efficient algorithm is to utilize a parallel sampling sort algorithm. The idea is to start off P processes and sampling randomly to obtain P-1 splitting elements. Then the Array of P-1 splitters are distributed to each of the P processes and input data is now sent around so each processor has its batch of data. Next, each process sorts its own batch. It turns out to be pretty fast in practice to run this kind of operation and it may be fast enough.<p>Note the distinct advantage of message passing here: It works, even if a process is running on another physical machine - shared memory doesn't. Also note that Erlang is not really built for parallel computation, and your example is one. My guess is that you can achieve a pretty good speedup with a sampling sort variant on multiple cores.<p>As for your flight seat problem, it really isn't. Keep the state of a plane in a process. That is have a single process assigning seats in the plane. On very large planes you may have 500-1000 seats. Hardly something which will dwarf a single process. Chances are, however, that you may want to assign seats to multiple planes at the same time. In that case you get your concurrency and a possible speedup.<p>As for getting linear speedup in Erlang systems:<p>First, your problem must expose the necessary amount of <i>work</i>. That is, there must always be something to do for an idle processor. In Erlang, this is easy to achieve if there are multiple agents interacting with the system at the same time, or you can create it yourself by spawning off some processes for each incoming job.<p>Second, your program must avoid contention around a single process. That is, you must ensure processors are not all looking for the same resource. We have tools like percept, the lock counter and dtrace for that.<p>An Erlang process works very much like transactional memory if written correctly. But TM has the same problem: contend around a resource and you are in trouble. It might be that the breaking point for contention is different due to different characteristics in overhead, but in principle the contention problem is also there.<p>Finally, there is a ""cheating"" possibility. Erlang provides ETS which is a tuple space for erlang terms. It allows parallel read and write access outside the process context. And very fast such RW access. For certain problems it can be used to allow multiple processes read access to the same data which can in turn speed their work up considerably.<p>But ETS is not distributed, oh the horror! Enter mnesia, which distributes ETS over multiple machines and optionally provides persistence. Mnesia is really a memcached/redis distributed in memory key/value store with DB-like query properties. Limited - but oh so powerful for certain problems.",1344176132

You could have 10,000 Erlang processes, but they all wait in line for this one process to service them.<p>If you use transactional memory with threads and mutable state, then all your booking processes can access the board state in parallel with ACI properties. Obviously, parallelism is still limited, as it always it, but as long as your booking processes are accessing different parts of the seat data structure, they can run in parallel. If they try to access the same part of the structure at the same time, all but one will be rolled back, but that one still gets through. Hopefully, they access different parts of the structure and sail through.<p>Your suggested Erlang program has no parallelism in it at all (for the isolated part of the seat booking of course), and will not scale to 2 cores, let alone the 64 cores I have in my machines at work.",1344176107

For another example, consider fully automatic self-updating servers. Without safe-guards, a configuration bug can bring them all down within minutes.

4341460,comment,4339531,4340607,4,0,Variance,,,"That's not true, because the idea that Knight's mispurchases were zero-sum isn't correct either.<p>All business enterprises, including stock trading, only operate when their returns can exceed the discount rate of the market [1]. This means that overall, the returns of all players in the stock market will tend to exceed 4-5% on average, and on a time-averaged basis. As a result, the S&P 500 has tended to yield an average return of 5% over the last decades [2]; it was higher before that when markets were younger.<p>What this means is that the stock market isn't zero-sum, but via the EMH, adds value to the economy. The first question you'll probably ask is, but <i>how</i>? The answer is that returns are made by making prices for assets, in this case stocks and other securities, more accurate. When the market has accurate prices it functions more smoothly [3], and this smoothness is attributed to stock investors, who make a profit from doing it.<p>This means that the market is benefited when prices are made more accurate--that is, when companies make profitable stock purchasing decisions. It's harmed when companies make unprofitable decisions. While other companies will buy Knight's errant stocks, their profits will ideally be less than Knight's loss, due to frictional costs. Goldman is just making a marginal profit on these purchases; Knight is taking a $440 million loss. Goldman isn't going to make $440 million on reselling Knight stock. This difference means that the transactions should ideally be a net loss to the market overall, because they were purchased in error and the time integral in the deviations caused in the affected stock prices is the factor by which the broader economy is harmed.<p>But yes, when the market functions correctly, it creates wealth by making prices accurate (price discovery [4]). When it functions incorrectly, a la Knight capital, prices are distorted and wealth (in this case the value of correct prices) is eliminated.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Total_annual_returns_.28b.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500#Total_annual_returns_...</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/the-function-of-speculators.asp#axzz22gEQ6BrT"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/09/the-function-...</a><p>[4]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4226738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4226738</a>",1344175816

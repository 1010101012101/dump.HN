She's throwing a spin-a-thon fundraiser at her local gym, and wanted a place where people could register for different spin-times online, as well as donate via credit card.<p>Beside good karma, donators should receive different supporting products - t-shirts, wristbands etc. (if they're over a certain amount - kickstarter style).<p>So another HN user and I decided it'd be a great site to build for free - and if it worked well for her, something we could offer for others as well.<p>The site automatically creates orders for her to manage when people donate over XYZ. She can manage the products - images, description etc. And the coolest part is the dynamic spin times (all she has to do is set a few variables and the rest of it is automated).<p>Obviously payments are done via Stripe - directly into her bank account.<p>Anyway, we'd love any comments / feedback about the usability of the site and or the design, and overall concept (as a platform we could offer for people to throw spin-a-thons).<p>And of course - feel free to load up on some good karma if you feel the desire - we know it would be much appreciated :)",1349182051

You also don't seem to know that Fast Startup is the default (so when you hit ""shutdown"" it actually hibernates most of the system's state).<p>Essentially in Windows 8 (out of the box) if you hit ""Shutdown"" then it logs the user out and then ""hibernates"" the kernel, the registry, services, drivers, and all other ""system"" level processes.<p>The computer is then ordered to power off (just like hibernate). When you turn the machine back on, a notice appears on the screen which reads ""Resuming from Hibernation"" and it loads the Hibernation file into active memory.<p>Fast Startup is essentially Hibernation without a logged in user.<p>Windows 8's boot times with Fast Startup enabled is very competitive to Windows 7's boot times using Hibernation (instead of ""Shutdown""). It is also very comparable too as Windows 8 doesn't truly shutdown in the traditional sense.<p>If you boot Windows 8 without Fast Startup enabled then the boot times are very similar to Windows 7's boot times.<p>As I said, Windows 8 lies to you. It isn't faster, it is just pushing Hibernation in a new deceptive way in order to appear faster.",1349181395

Be a 20-something year old program written by some GNU/Unix kernel/hardcore/early developer<p>2. Run in terminal with a million options and parameters<p>3.

Then no matter how terrible the user experience is and how outdated and irrelevant your program has become, you'll always have that cult who religiously love your program and insist on extending it so it can be a space shuttle as well as a text editor and an email client.<p>I should point out I'm not mocking any application in particular and I think many of these tools were fantastic for their times and some of them are still quite good today but my rant is towards this obsessive religious overly-appreciative culture of praising these softwares.<p>We are past that age of black screens and terminals and horrible user experiences. They were fine for their times but not anymore.
I'm not gonna put up with an application that is almost as old as myself and spend hours to configure it just to be a little more efficient.<p>The efficiency argument seems more like an excuse, because you don't want to admit that you are putting up with the downsides of the application because of all other nerd-culture reasons.<p></rant>",1349180757

It takes some practice to articulate, but there's rarely a choice that isn't related to your other choices, which are in turn related to your constraints.

Kivy is fast. This applies to both: application development and application execution speeds. We have optimized Kivy in many ways. We implement time-critical functionality on the C level to leverage the power of existing compilers. More importantly, we also use intelligent algorithms to minimize costly operations. Most importantly, we use the GPU wherever it makes sense in our context. The computational power of todays graphics cards surpasses that of todays CPUs by far for some tasks and algorithms, especially drawing. Thats why we try to let the GPU do as much of the work as possible, thus increasing performance considerably.

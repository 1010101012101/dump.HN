The employees try to maximize their income and value. It is true that the maximalization can also occure on group level and that this is not contractually or formally supported in our current economic model. But treating employees as costs individually or as a group will shift the problem.<p>It can be questioned that it is not such a radical zero sum game but at the other hand it feels like this is the most effective and simple behavior.<p>The inverted question is, what do organisations do to maximize the income of their employees?",1413730751

I have never studied outside Europe but even in Europe I have experienced grading systems were you are praised for your achievement with respect to your mates and others were you are praised for your achievement objectively. Honour titles are usually objective, and very hard to get while grants and scholarships are subjective, there is a quota set per year and it goes to the best that that year has to offer.<p>But yes, sometimes the incentive structures set up are really counter productive.

Giving someone a bad performance review or dealing with poor performance is inherently an uncomfortable social interaction.  Once a manager acknowledges that someone isn&#x27;t meeting standards organizations usually have a process by which they need to help that person improve or eventually fire them which is a lot of extra work for that manager.<p>In other words it is a way to force managers into dealing with bad employees instead of letting problems fester.",1413729797

8478386,comment,8477402,8478310,0,0,pron,,,"> Feminism wishes for multiple different phenomena to be described by the same label in order to help make reality clear?<p>No. The term &quot;sexism&quot; was first coined by feminists in the late sixties, and they defined its meaning to describe, well, sexism, rather than misogyny (the more overt, malicious, form of sexism, or the analogous to murder in your example), which is a far older word (<i>misogyny</i> appears in Webster&#x27;s, while <i>sexism</i> doesn&#x27;t).<p>There&#x27;s something else, though, that makes the accepted definition of sexism more &quot;correct&quot;, or, at least, more useful, than your one (which is common, but isn&#x27;t <i>the common</i> usage). Only the accepted definition of sexism describes how women are subjugated by society. Not misogyny, but a well established power structure, precipitated by many means, many of them innocent but certainly far from innocuous (same goes for racism, which is like sexism towards other races while xenophobia is analogous to misogyny). So, we already have a word for your definition, and personally I think that &quot;ism&quot; words are best used to describe social phenomena, or cultural ideas -- not individuals&#x27; actions (like murder) whose definition has to do with intent or judgment. &quot;Your&quot; sexism (which is really just misogyny) does not deserve an &quot;ism&quot; word, as it&#x27;s more an act, or a &quot;crime&quot;, than a cultural phenomenon.<p>True, you are not the only one to use &quot;sexism&quot; colloquially to mean misogyny, but in this case, let&#x27;s let the meaning of the word be that assigned to it by its inventors, at least while it&#x27;s still young.",1413729720

I can&#x27;t believe you&#x27;re not logging!<p>* First it starts out as a simple maze puzzle game.<p>* Then it there&#x27;re weird layouts where people are clicking stuff, and\n  pathways are opening up randomly.<p>* Then you realise it&#x27;s not random at all, people have to click things\n  for pathways to open.<p>* Then you realise someone has to stay behind and sacrifice themselves\n  for other people to go through.<p>* Then there&#x27;re levels where multiple people have to coordinate and\n  click at the same time to open n layers gates.<p>* Then there&#x27;re levels where not only do you have to stay behind, you\n  have to go out of your way to do so. So you&#x27;ll be letting people\n  through for a while, you realise, as it&#x27;s more efficient for the\n  group as a whole. At some point you have to decide you&#x27;ve taken your\n  turn and you move towards the main gate and wait, and then new\n  people come and then they have to realise to go to press the key.<p>* So next level you see someone sacrificing themselves and you decide\n  instead to go take their place and wiggle your mouse to tell them to\n  go. &quot;I got this&quot;, you indicate.<p>* Now some people have got it into their head this is all about\n  cooperation and selflessness. So you can be waiting in one of these\n  buttons in the middle of nowhere, letting people through for a\n  minute, and a new guy will start making their way towards you to let\n  you go, and you draw &quot;thanks&quot; on your way out, they wiggle their\n  mouse to say &quot;welcome&quot; and off you go, leaving them behind.<p>* On some levels, not only did people have to coordinate at the same\n  time, but things had to be done in sequence. On one, there wasn&#x27;t\n  enough people to hit all buttons at once, so we coordinated where\n  you would unwrap the &quot;outer&quot; layer of wall protecting the exit, and\n  a couple people would move inside, then you&#x27;d unwrap another inner\n  layer, and so on, until they could get out. Finally, you&#x27;d decide\n  your turn was over and go wait the same way. It took quite a while\n  before this was figured out collectively -- but once newcomers saw\n  how it was done it went in one smooth operation until I got out and\n  onto another maze.<p>And that&#x27;s to say nothing of the selfish people who just passed\nthrough maze after maze. In one maze people were waiting, and I and\nanother were at the buttons, but there was one other. One of them had\nto realise they needed to sacrifice themselves. We were both wiggling\nour mouses to indicate so, but they didn&#x27;t see it.<p>There&#x27;s also the way people will follow you in the maze if you look\nconfident, and the way people will draw on the right exit to help\npeople out. I&#x27;d try to leave a trail if I&#x27;d had the right exit cracked\nin the maze.<p>In a way I think the inability to write and communicate is fantastic:\nyou can&#x27;t just tell someone &quot;do this&quot;. They have to figure out that\nthey need to collaborate, they have to have some kind of intuitive\nsocial empathy that puts the needs of the many against the needs of\nthe few.<p>Genuinely, mate, this is the most fascinating &quot;game&quot; I&#x27;ve played in a\nlong time.

Evaluate and reward people for their individual performance, but <i>don&#x27;t make people compete by limiting the prize pool</i>. That is, everyone who reaches certain performance level get a fixed bonus, independent of how many others also receive it. This way, no one stands to gain anything by witholding knowledge, and everyone has an incentive to help everyone else because they can except to be helped in need as well. You also somewhat avoid the free rider problem, because people won&#x27;t keep helping those who are clearly just lazy.<p>Anecdote time! When I was a student, performance scolarships at my faculty were distributed this way. There were set thresholds, and if your grade average from the previous year was above a given threshold, you got +X money in scolarship. We were all extremely cooperative. People helped each other all the time, we pooled notes, scans, bootleg textbook pdfs, previous year&#x27;s exam questions, we passed this knowledge down to younger students, who in turn passed them further after adding more materials of their own. We&#x27;d happily help each other get better grades.<p>You bet there was a lot of us on those scolarships. And people who came from the outside were extremely surprised about how friendly and helpful everyone is.<p>After I left, my faculty was forced to make scolarships work the way they work at every other faculty/university - i.e. make only top X% of students eglible for rewards. This instantly killed teamwork dead. I know few people who are still studying and they say there&#x27;s a clear and visible difference now. People no longer share things. They don&#x27;t care about recording exam questions for others, they don&#x27;t coordinate the whole year to win something. Students stick to small groups and are antagonistic to others.

K projects often only involve one or two developers who model things in vector thinking (column based thinking in data domain), know exactly what to do and how to do it. Vector thinking is not suitable for all problems, but works really well if it does. Btw, new 3.2 version of kdb appears to be even faster than before.

So a hundred identical simple diodes should have insulation slipped on all of them and then the somewhat more cognitively challenging job of individual column wiring can just be bare wire.<p>Another suggestion is I&#x27;ve never built a keyboard but I&#x27;ve done weird LED arrays and one trick to pre bend all the leads the same way, involves a chunk of scrap wood and a bunch of nails (and maybe multiple forming steps/bending jigs).  Much like a sheet metal worker, you&#x27;ll rapidly discover the leads will spring back a little and you&#x27;ll have to bend them to 100 degrees if you want a right angle.  Its just scrap wood and nails, so play around a bit.  You can do it by hand but a bunch of nails in a block of wood works better and is faster overall.<p>You were worried a bit about getting the diode polarity backwards.  You have the source and you&#x27;d basically be inverting the bits you&#x27;re polling with, see the gh60/matrix.c code.  The system depends on the internal pull ups so you&#x27;d want to not enable the internal pull ups and solder in a couple external pull downs like 1K or so.  Just saying it would be survivable and more fun than redoing all those diodes not that its necessarily a good idea.<p>(edited to add, on your next build, if you want to try something really strange, wire up all the &quot;rows&quot; with 500 or so ohm resistors making a massive resistor divider such that the pin in the middle is at 2.5 volts and 0 and 5 volts at the ends, and then wire up the other pins in parallel.  So you hit the 1st of 10 and get an analog voltage of 0.5 volts, hit the 5th of 10 and the analogy voltage of 2.5 volts (for 5V anyway) and have the stereotypical onboard A/D microcontroller input sample it.

I mean, I can connect to my VPN at home, but NEVER from a Starbucks or public wifi.\n * At some level, I assume that my browser is maybe infected with some virus and plays some part in choosing what to block and when. \n * I assume that despite using a VPN, the government probably still knows what I&#x27;m looking at.\n * I assume that, somewhere on a government database, I have a profile that is invoked during the Firewalls activities that says &quot;yeah, don&#x27;t worry about this guy, he only reads news and isn&#x27;t involved in protest movements&quot; or something like that.<p>I&#x27;m not really paranoid (!), but just realised I have a lot of assumptions about what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes, but no idea whether those things are even possible.

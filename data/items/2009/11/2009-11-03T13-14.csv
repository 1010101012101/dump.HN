If you don't care about the protection of scope, you can make everything public, but you're still specifying scope. In Python, you don't specify scope at all. Even if you wanted to, you can't.<p>The same thing shows up in type checking. If you want, you just call everything an object in Java. It's vague and all-purpose, but you still have to specify a type. You still can't write 'a = 4'.

</code></pre>
You can start and continue with a Lojban sentence indefinitely via various means. Metalinguistic markers such as <i>sei ... se'u</i> allows a discursive (on-the-fly) predicate or sentence. You can insert parenthetical notes with <i>to ... toi</i> into anywhere. You can insert the attitudinals (used to express attitudes, emotions, evidentiality, etc.) into anywhere. A construct called <i>tanru</i> allows an endless sequence of predicates (whose form in Lojban do not alter according to the natlang parts of speech such as adjective or adverb, thus imposing less restrictions on the way you keep forming a sentence than natlangs such as English does). With <i>li'o</i> you can omit any quantity of text you don't want in your expressions. With <i>si/sa/su</i> you can 'erase' various mistakes in your utterance. And so forth.<p><pre><code>  > We pause and insert filler words to give us time to form our thoughts.

That's what <i>y</i> is for in Lojban.<p><pre><code>  > We use ambiguity because sometimes we just don't know precisely what we're trying to say
</code></pre>
The unambiguity of Lojban is mostly syntactic, not always semantic. You can be semantically ambiguous in Lojban with e.g. tanru.<p><pre><code>  > (Lojban has, if I recall correctly from Okrent's book, over 30 ways to say 'and').

I've found that having extraneous things don't make me any happier. Actively rejecting them as part of a radical lifestyle doesn't make me happier either. I am happy because I don't notice them missing, because I don't need them and don't have anyone around reminding me that I should or shouldn't.<p>The reason I define his lifestyle as radical is because of this.<p>""I hate civilization as much as anyone, but in these last few years before it crashes, we should appreciate and use what it offers.""<p>Civilization is <i>not</i> going to fail any more than every time prior where it was purportedly on the brink. If you are using this as an excuse for anything, please stop now. You are actively contributing to problems that, if civilization could fail, might cause it to do so. As romantic of a notion as this might be, it will suck beyond belief if it actually happens.<p>The other notion, that somehow our economy must either be Utopian or negatively-amortizing itself into oblivion, is stated as truth with nothing more than sneering toward idiots, elites, and robber barons as the perpetrators. I normally try to be more cool-headed than this, but this claim is <i>bullshit</i>. There <i>are</i> other options, and given incentives and perspective, people <i>will</i> pursue them. And the incentives are there, for them and everyone else, if people would knock off all of these various scorched earth policies.<p>The perspective this author offers will keep them from pursuing those options, if people listen to him. I want to liken him to a reader of tea leaves, who's motives may not be less than wholesome; is the tasseographer offering a vision into your future, or are they merely attempting to influence your frame of mind for their own benefit?<p>It is that frame of mind which determines whether or not you think doing hard work that you love for money is possible or desirable. I think it is possible; I've seen people do it. The author would like me to believe these people are living a lie, and are probably depressed and putting on an fake image for me. I wonder if he believes any of the depressed people are faking it?<p>As to whether it is desirable, this depends on one's frame of mind. Do you believe that a difficult problem you solve today will matter tomorrow? Do you believe that, if someone pays you to solve that difficult problem, it will matter less than one you solved for free? Do you believe that your work will benefit both yourself and society in some tangible and sustainable way? Do you believe that some impending catastrophe will render all of your work irrelevant? How much of this is passive believe, and how much of what you believe dictates your actions and the influence you have over the eventual outcome?<p>This really comes down to frame of mind, which seem more and more like matters of faith. You might think civilization sucks; you might think money sucks; you might think doing anything but the bare minimum amount of work to survive another day sucks. I would disagree with all of these claims, but how would I have a reasonable discussion about this? How do you change someone's frame of mind when the validation they've been seeking for years might finally come to pass tomorrow? In a way, I think the first step is realizing that our frames of mind are not without consequence.",1257255081

In mathematics it is relatively easy to break into the field with the backing of an institution (I mean easy relative to doing the same thing in say English or History, not in an absolute sense).  In fact, there is a long tradition of amateurs making some significant contributions, with Fermat being the crown (if now somewhat dated example.)<p>Also, one of his major complaints is how long it takes to get the PHD.  At least at UNLV (where I am currently seeking a master's in Math) most of my peers that are seeking their PHD expect to get it within 6 years after starting their graduate studies.  While this is still longer than a usual JD or MD program, it is at the very low end of the 6-9 year spectrum that was discussed in the article.<p>And while there is certainly a divide between theoretical mathematicians and their applied counterparts (or scientists who us mathematics) it is almost solely in choice of topic, not about disagreement over real facts, which you can see in some topics in the humanities between the professors and the general public.",1257254583

My theory (having grown up in the US and spent most of my adult life in Europe) is that the US is a society that is more ""hero"" driven -- and people that ""make it"" are more rewarded across the spectrum, whereas Europe tends to focus on a well-functioning welfare state.  As a result, the American version of poverty is rare in most western european countries, but society is also less structured for empowering individuals.  Both have their up and downsides.",1257253745

I looked at the top listing in the NYT and on ABC, as returned by Google, in order to get a definition.<p>Surely any country with limited healthcare resources requires someone (maybe a panel) to decide where to restrict application of resources. In many cases this failure to provide infinite resources to any health problem will result in premature death. So you could call the panels deciding on restricting care ""death panels"".<p>There's nothing controversial about that, is there.

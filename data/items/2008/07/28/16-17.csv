Right now the state websites are crap, they don't even tell you which forms you need to do. They need to come up with 1 government website, where you select what your business does, input how many employees you have, input your revenue and expenses, and then based on that info you get a generated list of all the forms you need to submit, already pre-typed with your relevant info. Then add email notifications for when its time to submit a new form.<p>Seriously why the hell do all government websites look like they were made in the 90s?",1217264308

You're not getting anything valuable from Average Joe, you're either getting a democratic assessment of something (ie, 1K Average Joes), which is nothing new,  or you are tapping into the top 1% of a particular niche.<p>That being said, the concept of firing your employees to tap the crowd as an entity for free is completely flawed.<p>What I find more likely to happen is that the crowd, whether the 1% or the group as a whole will begin to understand the value they create and will start to charge for that value. If the business community wants to hasten that reaction by ensuring the crowd is as under-employed as possible, then so be it.

That&#x27;s not to say that they were perfect (I try not to hero worship myself; it often leads either to disappointment or distortions), but it&#x27;s also nice to see the whole &quot;learn from history&quot; aphorism put into practice.",1383494354

I&#x27;m talking about the startups that have no real value besides the fact that someone has invested in them. These businesses are propped up and made to look successful while in reality, they are nothing more than a localized bubble. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, there are startups with real services and long term value but most are just a show. It seems like the goal of many major investors is to prop up a startup make it look successful, offer stocks publicly, cash out and repeat. These people are not creating lasting wealth. They are mining money from the general public.",1383494348

6663580,comment,6662847,6662847,69,0,jackgavigan,,,"Disclaimer: I have an MBA.<p>Dalton&#x27;s full of shit.<p>I could just as easily write a diatribe about developers who think of themselves as special snowflakes, future unicorn founder/CEOs, worthy of extremely high compensation and autonomy, yet have zero clue about business, can&#x27;t deliver a finished product to save their life and have no appreciation for the importance of usability when it comes to creating a product aimed at users who don&#x27;t have a CompSci degree.<p>During my stint as CTO of a dot-com back in 1999/2000, I realised that there was a lot I didn&#x27;t know about running a business, strategy, marketing, business development, finance, cash flow planning, accounting, cap tables, negotiation and all the other little things that add up to a successful venture. So, I decided to go to business school. But guess what? A lobotomy wasn&#x27;t on the curriculum. I can still knock together a shell script, tail -f a logfile and pipe it through grep, get some vague clue about why something crashed by casting my eye over a Java exception error, and make a lazy developer deeply uncomfortable when he realises that - would you believe it! - this particular MBA actually knows what exception handling is and wants to know why the fuck we&#x27;re not doing it.<p>Going to business school and getting an MBA added many new arrows to my quiver but it didn&#x27;t take any away. It didn&#x27;t narrow my horizons - it broadened them. The idea that an MBA can never be of any value to anything other than a large corporation is as ridiculous as the idea that a coder who learnt Java and the Waterfall method at college will never be able to learn Objective C and cope with Agile. True, some won&#x27;t be able to but that doesn&#x27;t mean that all won&#x27;t.<p>MBA curricula are often perceived as out of date because the content must be approved as part of the academic accreditation process. As a result, they often don&#x27;t incorporate the latest business methodologies. Whether that&#x27;s a good or a bad thing depends on whether the latest business thinking is merely a fad or something that will last as long as Clayton Christensen&#x27;s theory of disruption. But, either way, graduating from business school doesn&#x27;t mark the end of the learning process. My copy of Eric Ries&#x27; &quot;The Lean Startup&quot; occupies the same shelf as &quot;Strategic Management&quot; by Saloner, Shepard and Padolny, &quot;Let Me People Go Surfing&quot; by Yvon Chouinard, &quot;Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk&quot; by Peter L Bernstein and John W Mullins&#x27; &quot;The New Business Road Test&quot;. My last two Kindle purchases were Brad Feld&#x27;s &quot;Startup Communities&quot; and &quot;Four Steps to the Epiphany&quot; by Steve Blank.<p>Dalton claims that, &quot;to an MBA Strategy > Implementation&quot; but it&#x27;s truer to say that, to an MBA, Strategy comes before Implementation. To do the reverse, implementing blindly and pivoting wildly, is akin to blindly throwing darts at a dartboard - eventually one of them will end up in the bullseye but that isn&#x27;t necessarily proof that the thrower is anything other than lucky.<p>Dalton&#x27;s entitled to his prejudice. If he wants to take the shortcomings of a subset of MBAs and apply those as a stereotype across the entire population, that&#x27;s his prerogative. However, to make broad, sweeping generalisations about someone based on a single fact - whether it&#x27;s the fact that they have an MBA, what school they went to or the colour of their skin - is pretty foolish because the exceptions will bite you on the ass. For every lame MBA, there&#x27;s a Sheryl Sandberg or Alexis Maybank. For every team of MBA founders with all the strategy and no product, there&#x27;s a Matthew Prince and Michelle Zatlyn, who came up with the idea for CloudFlare at Harvard Business School[1], or a Neil Blumenthal, who attributes much of Warby Parkers success to his and his co-founders experiences at business school, which Blumenthal described as &quot;the most helpful and useful of any of my educational background.&quot;[2]<p>And, for every lame MBA, there are likely dozens of developers who scoff at the notion that building a successful company requires anything other than the ability to code, and certainly none of that crap they teach you in business school. Of course, if that were true, we&#x27;d have many more billion-dollar startups and far fewer founders making schoolboy errors that could have been easily avoided.<p>Maybe if Dalton had taken a few classes in strategy and marketing, Wired wouldn&#x27;t be writing about &quot;The Great App.net Mistake&quot;.[3]<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.cloudflare.com/our-story"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cloudflare.com/our-story</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/29/warby-parker-the-result-of-a-perfectly-calcuated-mba-machine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pandodaily.com/2013/08/29/warby-parker-the-result-of-...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/the-great-app-net-mistake/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2013/08/the-great-app-net-mis...</a>",1383494335

Issues like this are highly popular and resonate with everyone, but I haven&#x27;t been a fan of several of his policies.<p>He raised public parking rates to pay for street maintenance upgrades, safety at schools, etc. But, a lot of city streets have yet to be repaired, and safety at our particular local school has slowly been getting worse. He has had to deal with a police force in transition after a DoJ investigation, which he&#x27;s handled rather gracefully, so he&#x27;s done some things well. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s largely been a very mixed bag.<p>But the biggest frustration for me is that it always seems like he will say whatever is popular based on who is in the room.

Basically for CATV in Seattle there is a 5% sales tax on top of any and all other fees gathered by comcast and paid to the city.  You can call it a fee or bribe or compensation or whatever but its basically a sales tax.  The feds limit this local tax and there&#x27;s the usual boilerplate about increasing if legally allowed etc.<p>You can estimate based on subscriber numbers and bills or the other way around as total comcast revenue times percentage of comcast subscribers located in Seattle, well whatever either way its a substantial amount of money.

6663550,comment,6662728,6663139,27,0,hristov,,,"I do not buy that all. They say that streetcars were on their way out anyway because buses were more efficient. There is a significant hole in this reasoning because:<p>(a) GM is not in the business of owning street car lines;
(b) GM spent considerable money to buy out the street car lines, nevertheless.<p>If the street car lines were on their way out anyways why did GM spend so much money on something very much out of their usual line business? It may not be true that GM was the sole reason streetcars went away there may have been other factors, but it is hard to deny that GM played a role and a very significant role as they were the party that did the actual physical destruction.<p>And, by the way, the only reason buses seemed cheaper at the time was subsidies. Street cars had to pay for the building and upkeep of their rails, while buses used the streets, and the city paid for upkeep of the streets. One usually does not consider the damage buses do on the streets, but it is pretty significant because heavy vehicles do disproportionate amount of damage to asphalt. When all costs are added up, light rail is usually much more efficient than buses and that is before you even consider environmental costs.<p>It is quite possible that as citizens started worrying over their tax bills they would require bus companies to pay for the use of city streets. Interstate truckers, for example, are taxed for use of the highways. In that case, street cars would again become cheaper to operate than buses.",1383493997

If you have a problem with procrastination, it is a simple question of self-discipline or alternatively, knowing your own limitations. You can&#x27;t just read your way out of this problem.<p>The technique described in this post is more or less the exact technique I naturally use myself in order to get things done. Sometimes, it doesn&#x27;t work. Usually, this is because I am over my work capacity for the day. In this instance, the only thing which works is to either slog through and get terrible productivity per hour, or just take the rest of the day off. The latter is usually the best option, which results in better concentration the next day. But eventually, it really comes down to just sitting down and getting stuff done. If you are consistently unable to do this, maybe you should consider whether you are in the right line of work?",1383492725
6663469,comment,6662695,6662695,2,0,soundlab,,,"Cold calling via phone is a not an effective use of a smaller team&#x27;s time in my experience-- you will rarely reach the right person within an organization, there are lots of &#x27;gatekeepers&#x27; for high level executives, and voicemails just don&#x27;t generate responses.  You can only make so many dials per day, and it is exhausting getting rejected all day.  Where I&#x27;ve seen it become more effective is for larger inside lead gen teams for products like credit card terminals, or energy efficiency services where a quick pitch can be made to almost any business person who picks up the phone.<p>Email however, when done correctly (and legally!! don&#x27;t spam!!) can be very effective.  Instead of focusing on making a sale via an email, try instead to focus on getting a referral.  Consider it a &quot;win&quot; when you get a referral to someone in the organization with whom you can have a &quot;warm&quot; conversation.<p>If you are honestly looking for feedback on your product/service, the sales will come.  Your cold email will get forwarded to the right person and you can get some conversations started.  For us, these campaigns have been extremely low cost and have yielded some great partnerships and repeat business in our niche industry.<p>A couple rules we laid down:<p>1.  No attachments, no pricing, no selling<p>2.  Make no more than two attempts over 30 day campaign<p>3.

More of an OS tweaking focus than a language focus.<p>There is a startup lesson in this situation that anything shared can be a focus of pain, also any single point of failure can be a focus of pain.

It has motivated me to take my main project [0] farther than I would have otherwise, and it has pushed me to improve my overall git workflow.<p>One thing that might affect my streak is the use of feature branches. I&#x27;m a hobbyist-getting-more-serious programmer, and I am just getting away from the lazy habit of pushing every commit to master. But branch commits don&#x27;t count towards your contributions until you merge them, and I&#x27;m not sure how that affects streaks.<p>That said, if the point is to just make a commit each day and you&#x27;re not measuring that with a github streak, there&#x27;s no difficulty.

6663402,comment,6662728,6662951,4,0,bradleyjg,,,"The J barely goes into Queens, only at the very end does it have half a dozen stops in Woodhaven and Jamaica. Someone below mentions the L which as far as I know has no Queens stops, and the the M which does actually serve Middle village directly from Brooklyn but otherwise requires a giant loop through Manhattan.<p>This issue is near and dear to my heart, I live in Woodside but I have close friends in Park Slope. By car it&#x27;s a straight shot down the BQE -- 20 - 30 minutes depending on traffic. When all the subways are running, I can take the 7 to the G and it&#x27;s an hour and fifteen minute trip. But both the 7 and the G have terrible weekend schedules so if I wanted to go right now, I&#x27;d have to take the 7 to the Q and go through all of Manhattan and it&#x27;d take more like an hour and a half. Or I could take three buses and hope that scheduled connections actually happen.<p>If the timing works out it can sometimes make sense to take commuter rail from Woodside-Jamaica-Atlantic Terminal though that&#x27;s more expensive and you have to buy a ticket at the counter because the machines can&#x27;t figure it out.<p>As an interim measure they should put a couple of express buses going north south -- one could go from the 74th Jackson Heights station down the BQE to the Lorimer stop on the L and then continue on to the Atlantic Terminal. Another could link the Middle village terminus of the M to the M (and R, F, E) at Queens Blvd with a second stop along the 7. The long term solution is more lines. We should be doing that instead of spending billions on silly prestige projects like the new Penn Station they want to build.",1383491397

I have noticed two things:<p>1) getting &quot;in the zone&quot; takes less and less time. It used to take me most of my 20 minutes to actually get focused. Now, 3 or 4 minutes suffice.<p>2) the level of focus I reach is unusually high, especially for technical subjects.<p>A final remark is that I realized that you can do a lot of things by spending only 20 minutes every single day.

It wasn&#x27;t the normal speal, it was like watching a cheer leading squad cheer on the the never ending boom. I don&#x27;t know quite how to describe it, it was kind of eerie and surreal.

What would University look like if we scrapped our current model and started over? We think it will blend incredibly high-quality offline teaching and mentoring from real teachers (think the best charter schools in the country), not professors, with free but super high-quality flipped-classroom online learning (think EdX, Coursera), and a new model of apprenticeship so students leave school ready for anything. Were launching in Kenya early next year and aim to quickly expand across Africa.<p>Were looking for a versatile team member who can lead everything from our high-level technology strategy (When do we invest in building our own platform? Do our students use tablets or laptops?) to the nuts and bolts of our hardware decisions, front-end development and basic back-end (e.g., Rails + HTML/CSS + very basic devops on top of Heroku or AWS). This hire will be the founding member of our technology team.<p>Our dream hire is creative and resourceful but also ambitious  wed love this person to grow with us into a VP or CTO-type role over the next few years.<p>About us:<p>- Were taking on what we think is one of the biggest problems in the world
- Were a social enterprise and are funded so far with $1M+ in non-dilutive seed grants with another $1M on the way
- Our non-profit sister organization kepler.org, where were also part of the founding team, got more than 2,500 applications for our first 50 spots and has been written up in Scientific American, Fast Company, and The Chronicle of Higher Education, who thinks our work will be a model for the US.
- Were in Kenya but are open to discussing some remote work for the right candidate
- Competitive salary, generous equity awards depending on experience and awesome, inspiring teammates<p>About you:<p>- At least a couple years of experience building things, ideally front-end and back-end
- Agile generalist and resourceful problem solver
- Excited about a tech role that goes beyond getting people to click on ads<p>Anything you&#x27;ve built or designed (Github profile, personal web apps, design portfolio, etc) that you can include in your application much appreciated!",1383490938

You could feel the draft about 100m away and once you were inside it was overpowering.<p>I mean we saw the turbines, power transformes the spent fuel pool and the reactor hull and everything. But there you did not really get the right impression, as opposed to standing inside a tower which produces clouds which you can see from more than 50km away.",1338123563

Become a marketing money for the first four to five months and do minimal coding (that is why its called an MVP). Once you have people buying your product, then you focus on improving it (or refactoring to rails, for example). If you do get funding, then use the money to grow the business and software at the same time/ratio.<p>Reason why this may seem a bit alien to you is because it requires you to go into marketing mode from day #1. Something you may not be comfortable doing.<p>Plus, marketing a product is just not about adwords, blog posts, and link on hacker news. It requires you to actually talk to other people directly.

It's a clever way to create a cheap, effective organization to do what you're proposing. It's not an either/or, it's step one.<p>(2) Cheap doesn't mean free, which is why we're in a pretty reactive mode. Check out this chart of lobbying money spent by the entertainment industry vs. the tech industry:*<p><a href=""http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/68448_Page4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1111/68448_Page4.html</a><p>Getting a bill passed on the national level means having someone with access to 500-odd legislators meet and explain it to them, plus explaining convincingly why it won't seriously hurt them in the next election, which in turn means having a convincing case on the campaign contributions vs. public support equation. All of that translates to money (although the larger and more sophisticated your organization, the less money you need. See step one.)<p>* Of course ""entertainment industry"" vs. ""tech industry"" is a little weird, since tech is a tool often used for transmitting entertainment. Sony or Apple or Amazon probably pick one side of the line or the other as much as a matter of temperament as a matter of business.",1338123178

4030006,comment,4029715,4029715,27,0,viraptor,,,"Well, that's one biased post.<p>In ""bookmarks are not enough"", the author claims that that the commits just stay there after deleting the bookmark - the horror! Actually, the same thing happens in git. Commit unreachable via names will stay around until you run garbage collection. You can still see them in reflog.<p>""Anonymous heads"" - yes, that exactly why `hg push` warns you. Exactly the same reason rebase warns you that it's destructive and pull rebase isn't the default. So you don't make a mess by accident. If you want to see what's available in the remote repository, like after `git fetch`, you can see the new commits via `hg incoming`.<p>I can't agree with ""Nothing is lost"" either - the tree he presents is trivial. Give it a go on a repository with 10+ topic branches which are re-synched to trunk a number of times and with more than 2 commits. Suddenly getting everything labelled with branch names is much more useful.<p>I'm not against one system or another, but having a fair explanation of both systems would be nicer than a blog saying pretty much ""it's different than git, therefore it's bad"". In the end it's down to personal preferences. Some people find ""branch labels"" more comfortable to work with, some prefer ""branch bookmarks"". That's it. Yet every once it a while we get a long ""but this is so much worse than git!"" explanation. Great, I'll keep using hg because I like it better, thank you very much.",1338123077

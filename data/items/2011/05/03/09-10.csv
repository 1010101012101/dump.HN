The 81% figure was simply based on a geographic decay calculation - that is, it is a figure that represents the probability that Bin Laden was x km from his last known location in the Tora Bora region.  The larger x is, the lower the probability.<p>Parachinar is just the other side of the Pakastani-Afghan border, next to Tora Bora, about 50km away in fact.  The real location was much further",1304416567

2509461,comment,2507700,2508347,1,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"Any thoughts on why JPEG hasn't already been enhanced to near its maximum potential in reaction to competition from JPEG-2000 and JPEG-XR (or changes in usage, computer power etc.)? Is it because they are targeted at the high-end of the quality spectrum, whereas WebP seems (via it's WebM heritage) to focus more at the lower end and typical web, rather than photography, use?<p>It seems like those wanting to introduce WebP and those wanting to enhance JPEG for web use need to agree on some benchmarks/metrics to use. Either in collaboration (as why would Google object to smaller JPEGs?) or in competition like Sunspider vs V8 vs Kraken in javascript-land.<p>Whatever they come up with will have drawbacks but it'll be better than randomly comparing a handful of images by eye. And if it's automated and open sourced then criticisms can lead to improvements for everyone.",1304416114

It's the glasses that matter, the liquid inside could be anything.<p>Having something to do with your hands prevents/reduces nervousness, and the fact that you can't drink and talk at the same time <i>enforces</i> conversational turn-taking. All these things apply to cigarettes too, which goes some way to explaining their tenacious grip on some social groups despite their lack of tangible benefits, (ie. they dont get you high)<p>These are the most important things, but also there's the halfhourly rhythm of having to get new drinks, which gives everyone a chance to switch conversations, and the practice of buying strangers drinks in rounds, which builds and reinforces trust.<p>So yeah, don't sweat about the intoxicants if thats not your thing.

For example, certain generations of Macbook Pros are just not happy with certain SSDs. We've had customer that had two or three failures with a certain brand / model / chipset, and then changing to a different SSD they haven't had problems.<p>- The failure rate for SSDs overall is higher than that for HDDs, but lower than the failure rate for some other products (such as Graphics cards).<p>- Every SSD we have sold went into a custom built system or was installed afterwards into a laptop, so I don't buy the argument that problems are caused because it's installed by an end user and not at the factory.<p>- They are <i>blindingly</i> fast. In my opinion, it's better for 90% of users to put a new Intel SSD into their existing system, than it is to buy a new system.",1304415275

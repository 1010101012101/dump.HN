However, they need to offer intro classes for the majority of subjects because most students won't know accounting and finance even if they've been in the working world for awhile beforehand.  I think the clear advantage to the graduate program is that you can study only business.  While I suppose I can have more intelligent conversations with other college-educated folk because I had to read Kant, Bentham, etc., I wouldn't mind having skipped all those philosophy classes in undergrad.  There are also more advanced classes in the graduate business curriculum.  I'm not sure what it is exactly about the curriculum that you see as problematic or would suggest changing.",1303404664

And the 4 months before that, and the 4 months before that. And this is dwarfed by all the great music new being made all around the world.<p>I find most of my music through fliers, last.fm friends, hyperlocal news and forums dedicated to particular subgenres.

Here's the whole story, found in this book: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?id=HmyqbzrlVpkC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?id=HmyqbzrlVpkC</a><p>Bezos's story resonated among the book-buying public, the investment \ncommunity, and beyond. At its peak, the story was so compelling that \nhe was Time magazine's 1999 ""Person of the Year."" Months before Bezos \nearned that particular accolade, however, Friedman detected a flaw in \nthe story. On February 26. 1999. Friedman's column ""Amazon.you,"" \nasked: What's so special about selling books over the Internet? He introduced Lyle Bowlin, a professor of small business at the University of \nNorthern Iowa and founder of Positively-you.com, a bookselling Web \nsite. Bowlin, his wife, and his daughter ran Positively-you out of their \nspare bedroom. This arrangement let Positively-you cut its overhead even \nfurther than Amazon—according lo Bowlin, down to about $150 a \nmonth—and thus to undercut Amazon's prices. Friedman's conclusion? \n""For about the cost of one share of Amazon.com, you can <i>be</i> Amazon.com.""<p>Not surprisingly, Friedman's column was good for Bowlin's business. \nWithin ten days, Positively-you's business had grown by a factor of about \nthirty. Bowlin moved its operations out of the spare bedroom and into \nthe formal dining room. Friedman responded with a follow-up column,\n""KillingGoliath.com,"" in which he summarized Positively-you's success \nin a two-word reply directed at the skeptical readers who'd questioned \n""Amazon.you."" No, not those two words. This was, after all, the op-ed \npage of the New York Times. Friedman's response was a fully capitalized ""YOU'RE WRONG.""<p>That's where Scott Rosenberg entered the story. Rosenberg, the managing editor of Salon.com, was one of the skeptical experts to whom \nFriedman had directed his reply. In ""Amazon vs. the Ants,"" Rosenberg \nexplained that Friedman had captured only half the logic of the online \nmarketplace. That half, the low cost of getting started, certainly allowed \nhobbyists like Bowlin to launch commercial ventures. The other half, \nin Rosenberg's view, was what set Amazon apart from Positively-you. \nHe cited two fatal flaws with Positively-you's business model. The first \nflaw stemmed from scalability. Positively-you's overhead was lower than \nAmazon's precisely because it was a smaller operation. As business grew, \nBowlin would have to relocate yet again, likely to a warehouse for which \nhe might actually have to pay rent. He would also eventually run out of \nunpaid family membeis and need to hire employees. These costs would \ndrive his overhead up and narrow if not eliminate any cost advantage \nthat he maintained over Amazon. The second flaw dealt with the challenges and the expense of generating traffic comparable to Amazon's. \nRosenberg simply assumed that Bowlin couldn't rely upon the substantial free publicity that he received by appearing in Friedman's columns. \nRosenberg's conclusion? ""If I were Amazon's Jeff Bezos, I wouldn't be \ntoo worried.""<p>Lyle Bowlin and Positively-you then proceeded to fall from public view \nfor about a year. They reappeared March 3, 2000, in columns written by Friedman and by Rosenberg. Friedman's ""Saga of an Online Pioneer"" told of Bowlin's attempt to leverage his early publicity into a real business. He raised $90,000, took a leave from his teaching position, rented office space, hired employees—and went out of business. \nFriedman considered Positively-you's failure instructive. He cited a \nnumber of lessons that he had learned about e-commerce. The two most \nsignificant of them were the difficulty of scaling costs and the challenge \nof driving traffic to a Web site. Rosenberg's column basically said ""I told you so,"" which, of course, he had.",1303403012

The games come in from a few different XML feeds 'mochigames' being the big one.<p>There are some crons that run a few times a day to update the list of available games.  So I hop on my portal every day and check out a few of the games on the ""newest tab"" anything I ""vote up"" (while FB logged in) also gets shown on the ""featured"" page.<p>Some of the neat things I've done (IMO) include the live search, infinite scrolling and ""zoom button"" on the games page (which is actually slightly deprecated at the moment, but it was a great idea when used in a different layout).<p>While I was actively promoting it, I managed to get it to somewhere within the top 300K websites worldwide, but the marketing model of 'spamming reddit' isn't really rewarding so I'm looking at trying to find a model that actually adds more value to the web-gaming experience.<p>A forum for example - currently just one guy talking to himself.  Or maybe the ability to ""turn off"" all adsense advertising (with facebook login).<p>In terms of marketing, I've been testing out the impact of having a better, more keyword rich domain - copies have gone up on <a href=""http://1fungame.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://1fungame.com</a> and <a href=""http://games-to-play.co"" rel=""nofollow"">http://games-to-play.co</a> - so far I'm finding that the users that come in to the keyword domain bounce a hell of a lot less and stay for a lot longer ... I'm still not convinced I should 301 (HTML code for moved permanently).<p>I was really excited about it when it first launched because it made $1 in adsense within a few hours of launching ... then it got really exciting and paid for the registration fee of the domain name.  Nowadays it doesn't quite cover hosting fees but if we did everything for the money we wouldn't be hackers right?   :)<p>Anyways... that's a really long answer to a very short question.

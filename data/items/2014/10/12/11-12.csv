8445042,comment,8444603,8444603,0,0,DCKing,,,"The title of this article is needlessly inflammatory. Can some mod change it? <i>ChromeOS</i> is not dropping support ext* at all; its <i>files application</i> that is meant to be used with external drives is. That&#x27;s a pretty huge difference.<p>I actually think the rationale for this is pretty good:<p>> Re #19, we understand that this was an undesirable decision for some users, but we sometimes need to make a product decision like this. Chrome and Chrome OS strive for simplicity. Every feature comes with complexity. Complexity adds maintenance cost, QA cost, slows down development, and adds surface of security exploits (as mentioned in #12). We should add a feature only if its benefit clearly outweighs its cost, but this particular feature was slipped in for some historical reason.<p>It&#x27;s a shame for the people who were actually using this. But lots of people are overlooking that <i>this is just about the ChromeOS files application</i>: ChromeOS can still mount and access ext* drives in general through its Linux kernel and utilities, Crouton and the likes can still use it, and people who specifically need to use the files app for whatever reason have plenty of choices for a file system.",1413114952

The near-ubiquity of flat reading and writing surfaces is a recent development afaics: even old mass-manufactured school desks from the early-mid C20 tend to have pitched surfaces. The explanation seems to be that while pitched surfaces are better than flat horizontal surfaces for both reading and writing, flat surfaces are superior for piling crap onto (loose papers, books, telephones, adding machines, typewriters and what have you).",1413112738

The other FS they seem to support [exFAT, FAT, UDF, NTFS] all are (as far as I know, and under Linux) completely agnostic to permissions and user-IDs: everything gets squashed to one uid/gid and fixed permissions.<p>Probably <i>that</i> is the actual problem they want to get rid of and which causes pains? They only mentioned the labeling as &quot;features such as...&quot;, so there might be more bugreports/requests...<p>Android (at least the Cyanogenmod variety on my phone) works around it with a small fuse-shim that fixes user-visible permissions on the fly, for all FS, including ext4. And ext4 makes for a very nice and well-performing fs on my phone.",1413112655

I agree that the best characters are exceptional, but flawless characters are difficult to take seriously, and tend to be quite boring.<p>Take Frodo Baggins, Thomas Covenant, Malta Vestrit, Jon Snow, Miles Vorkosigan, Sherlock Holmes or any of the countless prominent characters from fiction of any genre -- they are all quite exceptional, but also significantly flawed in one or many ways. I didn&#x27;t see any prominent flaws in Kvothe, which made him really boring and uninteresting; now, as someone else mentioned, he <i>is</i> an unreliable narrator of his own life story, and it is quite possible that in later books it will turn out that a lot if it was a lie and his flaws will be revealed, but by then I have long lost my interest and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever get that far.

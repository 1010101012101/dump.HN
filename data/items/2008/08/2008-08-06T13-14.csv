268458,comment,268386,268386,0,0,peterhi,,,"My iMac lasted 6 years and died last month after being on for 24/7 for all that time. It cost me £1,200 when I bought it. So that's around £200 a year. I expect my new Mac Mini will last just as long and it only cost £400.<p>My £1,500 PC on the other hand is only two years old and is showing signs of dying and I question the value of trying to fix it given that no one seems to be able to nail down the problem. PCs just don't have the life expectancy of Macs.",1218030905

According to the WSJ, the e-mails indicate that Grubman upgraded AT&T's stock rating from 'hold' to 'strong buy' at the urging of Citigroup Chairman Sandy Weill. In return, Weill is said to have promised to use his influence to get Grubman's daughters' admitted into the nursery school at the 92nd Street Y. Investigators from the New York district attorney's office, who are looking into the matter, say Grubman's twin girls began attending the Y just weeks after Citigroup donated $1 million to the 92nd Street Y's highly regarded preschool. That school is one of a handful of New York City preschools with reputations for sending their alumni on to the most prestigious private elementary and high schools.</i>""",1218030867

In fact, the only sport I care about is hockey; the rest I essentially hate. I am still very passionate about the project, however, because it has been very entertaining from a technical perspective and has been a great opportunity to not only take part in YC, but build a company with a very old friend.<p>I'm very passionate about the site, but not because I necessarily want to make my own ticket-buying experience better. I like TS because it's a useful service for other people, presents challenging work, and has been an opportunity to work with very large volumes of data, among other reasons. I may not find tickets or sports exciting, but not once since the start of this project have I thought to myself, ""I really wish I was working on something else.""<p>Edit: Once we have concert listings I suppose I can meet the artificial requirement of building something I would use because there's little I'm more passionate about than music.",1218030569

We thought about this but including the buying phase on our website would not only expose us to significantly more liability but it would essentially destroy millions of dollars in brand equity that places like Stubhub and Tickets Now have built.<p>Although we agree that it's not as convenient, we're pretty set on sending our visitors to the actual providers (like Kayak does with airlines). Not doing that carries a lot of wrongly addressed customer service issues and liability exposure we're not prepared to and don't want to, deal with.<p>We're going to be adding servers soon so our crawls will approach closer and closer to real time.

If the article you linked to is correct, then the World Bank is playing a devious game of sleight of hand: They got the idea that the US must have ""intangible wealth"" because of the fact that the domestic resources and domestic production don't account for all the wealth. The sleight of hand is in the fact that they never consider the fact that the USA's rich classes operate in dozens of countries. The US imports most of its natural resources, and it even imports a large portion of the finished goods. All of these imports benefit American investors. About the only thing they export are the costs: Those who aren't part of the rich class have to constantly worry about their jobs going to China, India, Jakarta, and Indonesia, where labor is cheaper.<p>All ""intangible"" means in this case is ""Oops, we missed it!""",1218028759

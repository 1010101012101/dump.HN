9608621,comment,9603845,9603845,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"About time they see it! I&#x27;ve been pushing native, Internet apps over web since the beginning. The reason: native apps can be faster, leaner, more flexible, more portable, and more secure. Most things I can do to boost one of these metrics in a native app I <i>can&#x27;t</i> do in a web app. Let&#x27;s put this in perspective: my 1998, 200Mhz P2, 64MB RAM machine&#x27;s native apps did more than modern web apps and with fewer problems. And could connect to people and use presentation layers... just like the web!<p>One writer argued the reason the Web took off was a standard, usable presentation format (HTML) combined with easy distribution (hyperlinks) and instant updates (connect for freshest version). This spread across both users and platforms. Its continual improvements gave it new features. To this day, the standardization and easy distribution makes it easier to push content to most users via a web browser.<p>Yet, even big Web companies such as Facebook are switching to Internet-style apps for mobile and Internal use. That&#x27;s saying something. I guess they don&#x27;t want around 500 bytes of HTTP overhead to send 1 byte of data. The best solution is a portable platform that solves the presentation, linking, and updating issues that web did. There&#x27;s a number of older vendors and startups doing this. Hopefully we&#x27;ll see more take-up and network effects on that side of things.<p>Note: Anyone still thinking the Web was the best route to go, but wanting native advantages, should Google Tannenbaum&#x27;s Globe distributed toolkit that supplemented Amoeba distributed OS. They even ported the Web to run on top of it and side-by-side with its applications. Compare work like that to the web of the same time period and you&#x27;ll see why Web is inherently inferior due to bad (or misappropriated) design. It always will be to a comparable, native product.",1432688050

I know he&#x27;s come out in support of the tea party recently, but that&#x27;s not really his roots (unless you consider the tea party to be libertarians as well. The definition has changed a bit over time).<p>Generally speaking, I think most people would get behind libertarianism if they could get past the nut job conspiracy theories. Generally speaking, liberterianism is fiscally conservative, socially liberal, in favor of limited government, limited intervention in individual&#x27;s lives, pro small business, anti crony capitalism, and generally on the right side of most recent issues that have come up from bail outs to wars (overseas and on drugs).<p>Of course, you&#x27;ll hear the nutjob stories saying that libertarians want to eliminate public schools or privatize fire departments.

9608581,comment,9606345,9606345,0,0,nemanja,,,"Putting together an effective presentation and visual aid (i.e. slide deck) is very time consuming, very iterative, requires a lot of thought and reflection, at least a few reviewers that are removed from putting it together and/or the topic, and a lot of practice. Reducing presentation to simply putting together a slide deck is a fail from the get-go. Blaming bad presentations on the tools used to put them together is shallow.<p>While there is really no substitute for good coaching, first hand experience, mistakes made and good feedback, here are a few quick tips that I&#x27;ve picked up over the years -<p>1. The best and most engaging presentations simply have a title that captures the key point and a nice/fun background photo that supports/illustrates the story. Audience will pay attention to the story instead of reading text off the slide.<p>2. To highlight a fact, keep it to one fact per slide. Make it short and direct (e.g. &quot;3x faster&quot; rather than &quot;212.32% performance improvement&quot;).<p>3. To illustrate a quantitative point, one chart per page is okay, but it must be super simple and easy (absolutely no 3D nonsense, at most 3-4 bars/2 lines/3-4 pie slices, clearly labeled axes). Multiple charts are sometimes okay, but they must be each super simple, belong together, have the same scales and tell a clear and obvious story. Effective charts are a topic of its own, anything by Tufte is a great head start.<p>4. If you must have more than one point on a slide, keep it at 3 direct, concise bullets per page (if any bullet wraps with a large font, it&#x27;s too wordy and unclear). No sub-bullets or additional explanations should be necessary. Two bullets is too little (i.e. condense it to one key point), four is too much.<p>5. No more than one simple diagram per page. Best to keep it to the title that captures they key point and a diagram. Additional explanatory text should not be necessary - if title + diagram can&#x27;t stand on their own, they are not good enough. Also, if the point of the diagram is not immediately obvious to someone looking at it for the first time, the diagram sucks.<p>6. Avoid wall of text (e.g. that NASA slide on Columbia&#x27;s tiles) at all costs. Audience will start reading the slide, completely tune out what you are saying and then get bored half a way through and give up.<p>7. Contrasting points or showing contradictory data/ideas requires extra care to avoid cognitive dissonance.<p>8. Background should be as plain as possible. White is best, black/gray could be okay. Anything else pretty much sucks. All text in one color, with great contrast to the background.<p>9. Timing/length of presentation is super important. Generally, it is very hard for people to stay focused for more than ~7 minutes, so it&#x27;s good to cover a point in less than 7 minutes and then change it up a bit (e.g. change presenters, show a video, get to a different topic). Overall, presentations should be less than 30 minutes, 45 minutes tops. Anything longer than that is simply too long, you&#x27;ll lose the audience.\nHere are two books on the topic I found helpful. They are easy to follow, very short and to the point - &quot;Style: Toward Clarity and Grace&quot; [1] and &quot;Guide to Managerial Communication&quot; [2].<p>* * *<p>Overall, the piece feels quite trashy - it dumps all the blame where it doesn&#x27;t belong (tool vs. lack of presentation/communication skill). Those slides could have very well been made in Keynote or Reveal.JS and they wouldn&#x27;t suck any less. The piece is also not constructive, it doesn&#x27;t give reader any hints or tips how to make presentations better.<p>Finally, a great counterexample to the main point of the piece is pretty much every slide deck that comes with Apple/Steve Jobs&#x27; keynote. The best part is that no one remembers or pays particular attention to the deck, but if you analyze the presentation more closely or watch it a couple of times, it becomes clear how effective the decks are.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226899152"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0226899152</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013297133X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/013297133X</a>",1432687149

They heavily promote the idea that government is inefficient because it keeps people voting for them and, most importantly, keeps corporate-backed groups like Fox News from going on the attack in the next election.<p>That might necessitate a token effort somewhere to cut things but the real goal is the posture, not the results, so maximizing inefficiency isn&#x27;t something they&#x27;re concerned with. In most cases, they&#x27;ll try to cut things which affect people who don&#x27;t vote for them anyway – mass transit, funding for the poor, etc.",1432687079

This is &quot;proper time&quot;, i.e. time as measured by the unfortunate person in the space ship who&#x27;s falling in.<p>The observer outside never sees you hit the event horizon in the first place, so I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s well-defined to talk about how long an outside observer thinks it takes you to hit the horizon once you&#x27;ve crossed the singularity.<p>Incidentally, one thing the article got right is that time and space are kind of switched inside the black hole.  Once you cross the horizon, the singularity is no longer something that&#x27;s radially inward from you.  Instead the singularity is in your future, kind of like tomorrow is in my future.  This is part of why you can&#x27;t escape.  Once you&#x27;re inside, it makes no sense to fire your rockets to push yourself backwards in time.  In fact, firing your rockets just makes it worse.  You&#x27;ll accelerate, and the resulting time dilation will actually /reduce/ the perceived time before you hit the doom in your future.<p>This is a big difference between GR black holes and toy classical black hole models.  In a classical black hole (a point mass and an &quot;event horizon&quot; around it where the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light), you can try to throw something outside the horizon, and it might escape the horizon, but it&#x27;s guaranteed to fall back in unless someone catches it or it has rockets and can continue propelling itself outward.  In a real GR black hole, you can&#x27;t cross the horizon from the inside in the first place.  Despite this, if you squint a bit, the toy classical model predicts the Schwarzchild radius correctly",1432687058

I&#x27;m looking at the problem as a software engineer, who has to make architectural decisions about the applications I&#x27;m building. You&#x27;re looking at it like a programmer. YAGNI is very much not an &quot;engineering&quot; response, it&#x27;s a &quot;programming&quot; response. Engineering is all about careful, methodical design and architecture and planning for the future maintenance of the product. YAGNI is pretty much the antithesis of this.<p>I&#x27;m curious what kind of software you work on. Most of the software I do is applications / frameworks development. Planning ahead is very important when developing the architecture of an application, and is doubly-so when doing any kind of API design (both when developing frameworks and when developing reusable components inside of applications). You certainly don&#x27;t need to implement everything up-front, but you do have to understand the future requirements and design appropriately. Failure to do so leads to blowing out time / budget estimates later when you realize your code isn&#x27;t maintainable anymore and all the &quot;quick&quot; implementations people did to avoid having to make architectural decisions are now so fragile and dependent upon assumptions the implementor probably didn&#x27;t even realize they were making that you can&#x27;t change anything without having large ripple effects.",1432687053

I agree that PowerPoint is not the right medium for many things (e.g. technical reports), but a lot of these critiques are also the strengths of PowerPoint. The lack of space forces the presenter to slim down their argument to the essentials. That shouldn&#x27;t encourage burying important information in sub-bullets, but to the contrary, encourage highlighting key risks/concerns.<p>The downside of technical reports and white papers is that it&#x27;s far too easy for people to blather on without purpose, and it&#x27;s far too hard for me as the audience to review. I can skim through a PowerPoint in minutes and get a good sense for whether it&#x27;s worth my time. It&#x27;s much harder to do that with a long free-form text. I also think the presenter is more important than the medium in most cases: I bet the same person making those awful NSA slides would write an awful white paper (and vice-versa).<p>Long story short, people have a really hard time concisely and precisely expressing their arguments, and we all need constant practice to get better.

It&#x27;s certainly hard to come up with solid ideas without a clear understanding of the game&#x27;s pacing.<p>In RTS games, teching and building armies compete for resources, so I&#x27;d hazard guessing that Game 1 happens because somebody opted for early aggression, which forces everybody to spend money on units to fight off the early threat. Looks like a well balanced game where both teams kept the aggression level high, which justifies the long duration, and the low-tech end-game.<p>Second game looks like there was little to no early-game aggression, which meant that everybody got to funnel resources into teching up early. I&#x27;m not sure if late-tech battles are more all-or-nothing, or whether one team was just clearly stronger than the other -- though if that&#x27;s the case, why didn&#x27;t they push for an advantage earlier?

I thought it was just a way to get the conservation laws for cheap (kind of like how you got the equations of motion from Lagrangians for cheap, as was my understanding at that point).<p>Then, I learned about trying <i>local</i> U(1) symmetry and trying to make the Langrangian invariant under that and wham, you get EM for free, without even postulating it a priori. I was amazed--all of a sudden, I realized the reason why all these particle physicists were so bent on postulating this or that symmetry, hitherto not seen, might exist in nature; I realized how fundamental symmetries were and how deeply intertwined with conservation laws they were.",1432684931

It feels so easy and straightforward at first but I often keep hitting silly annoyances that slow down debugging time or even causes fatal exceptions of its own (eg resizing a window).<p>So I&#x27;d be interested to hear another developers experiences with termbox",1432684903

On the side, that might also be a good reason for your marketing team to target customers in areas with high energy prices. Just a thought.<p>I&#x27;m still waiting for Adapteva to combine their work with SGI- or NUMAscale-style tech to have a UV-style system full of CPU&#x27;s, your accelerators for general use, and optionally FPGA&#x27;s for special purpose stuff. The CC memory + bandwith + ton of Adapteva IC&#x27;s per node would = incredible performance per dollar and watt. Maybe. ;) Any plans for integrating with ccNUMA architectures?",1432684903

That is, this data size constant was duplicated in many places, rather than defined in one central place.<p>Unless I&#x27;m misreading you, that&#x27;s not an appropriate YAGNI case, as Fowler writes:<p>&quot;Yagni only applies to capabilities built into the software to support a presumptive feature, it does not apply to effort to make the software easier to modify&quot;",1432684852

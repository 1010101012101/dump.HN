There&#x27;s a reason why the women and children were there to be killed: they were traveling with the military and participating in military actions. If you read link at the top of the thread, the survivors were given permission by Caesar to depart, but they chose to remain with him because they were afraid of facing the revenge of the people who they invaded and killed.<p>In that context, it is difficult to see how they can really be identified as civilians in a meaningful way.<p>The article is somewhat misleading in that it makes it seem as though these tribes were just peacefully wandering around when they asked Caesar for asylum. They were invading, and after they invaded, they <i>then</i> asked for asylum from the man charged by the Romans to defend the area. Their &#x27;request for asylum&#x27;, by the way, was something along the lines of &quot;we can be allies, as long as you give us new lands or let us keep the ones we&#x27;ve invaded. Otherwise, just so you know, the only people stronger than us are the Suevi, who drove us from our homes. So watch out.&quot; Of course he said no.",1450479517

I was intending to sarcastically take the position that one feminist website is a rulebook for everyone, because that&#x27;s how people seriously act all the time. The woman in the dongle fiasco believed that because she was offended, everyone should be, and the conference organizers apparently agreed. She had plenty of supporters -- was it really just &quot;one single woman&quot;? Maybe it&#x27;s a bad example, because as the situation evolved she was being attacked (and in response, supported) more as a woman than as a professional maintaining certain standards. But I do believe a substantial chunk supported her position itself, a complaint primarily about sexism.<p>On the other hand, the OP herself is in the gray (for now at least) for saying dick jokes are fine and the only sexism there is the lack of vulva jokes.[1]<p>The fact that there is no rulebook was exactly my point. For every person wanting to analyze whether your anatomical/sexual reference is offensive to someone, there is someone else feeling singled out that you would take that care before saying it in front of them. I don&#x27;t want to throw up my hands and give up, just point out that people act like the answers are easy but it&#x27;s actually very complex. There&#x27;s little consensus on proper behavior on these small scales, and both sides have tribal and exclusionary behaviors.<p>Behavior of today&#x27;s college students, in the US at least, suggests the Tumblr generation is growing and therefore a sizable contingent of people really will increasingly apply these standards to everyone else.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10760819"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10760819</a> (you have to go up to parent to see the grayness, and I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s the OP because she claimed so in another comment and has a sufficiently-aged account with the same name as the website)",1450479459

Reposting a comment from just four days ago:<p>The AMA is a common scapegoat, except that the AMA has literally nothing to do with the number of of doctors supply-side.<p>You&#x27;re probably thinking of the AAMC, which has nothing to do with the AMA, and is responsible for the number of medical students who graduate each year from the US. Except the AAMC has very deliberately and openly increased the number of medical student slots each year for over a decade, specifically with this goal in mind.<p>But even this is a moot point, because the number of people gradating with MDs is not the bottleneck - the problem is that doctors can&#x27;t practice medicine until they complete a residency program. We graduate more medical students every year than we have residency slots available, so increasing the number of graduates even further will have no effect.<p>Increasing the number of residency slots is up to Medicare, because Medicare funds residency programs nationwide, as residency programs do not make enough money to sustain themselves otherwise.",1450479275

The sense I&#x27;ve gotten is that these big companies tend to compensate all new hires approximately the same, caring little about experience outside their company or perhaps one of the other big companies. It seems to me that smaller, less well known, companies are more hungry for experienced people, because they are relatively starved of people who can drive architecture, decision making, and hiring, and are thus more willing to take a risk on paying a premium for experience.<p>So my question is: stipulating that the numbers favor bigcos for fresh graduates, is the same true for people who already have that 5 (or 8, or 15, or 20) years of experience elsewhere?",1450479046

In my case it was primarily caused by what was called &quot;anxiety&quot; until recently and is now generally called a &quot;stress disorder,&quot; but for most of that period the stress disorder was entirely cryptic;  I had no idea that I was a particularly &#x27;anxious&#x27; or  fearful person.<p>I can tell you that my condition eventually responded dramatically to medication, and that I would not be able to live the life I live now if it were not for that medication;  furthermore, that because of the medication and my experience during the years I have been on it, I can look forwards to continuing to reduce my dependence on that medication.<p>Depression is indeed a normal response to ongoing helplessness and despair.  I probably share your experience of depression in this regard, because the &#x27;depression&#x27; that I had been treated for for years was suddenly completely irrelevant the moment my brain finally responded to medication.<p>However, there are several things that this account leaves out.  You can&#x27;t scoff and say that depression is just an normal response any more than people can scoff and say the reason you don&#x27;t want to take a shower is because you&#x27;re lazy.  For one, as you know, depression can be very self-perpetuating.  People come to believe things that keep them depressed, ruminating on their depressed state over and over again.  People always see verification and never contradiction of their worldview, even though the entire world has somehow failed to just lay down and die over the course of many thousands of years, which is what it would do if that understanding of reality was valid.  And people very definitely do encounter depression that does not have a proximate external cause to justify the response;  many of those Afghanis, for instance, will suffer from the bleakest of depressions for many years after the wars in Afghanistan are ended.  All of these things constitute a medical condition.  If you don&#x27;t like the word &quot;illness&quot; because of how it makes you feel, I can sympathize.  But that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the fact that depression is something that frequently does become a genuine medical problem and frequently does require a solution beyond the reach of the person suffering from it.",1450478511

(Also in terms of taking a picture you are zooming the image in with the microscope lens, then zooming it back out with your cell phone lens)<p>That being said, this project is important philosophically I think and projects like it are going to be huge.<p>The real &#x27;killer scopes&#x27; for me would be<p>1. 10-15 dollar scope with battery and camera. This is possible as raw camera chips only require 10x magnification (as opposed to the 100-600x this is providing) so it&#x27;s cheap/easy to get better optics. One could imagine a low cost camera chip attached to a lens like this scope&#x27;s (but a bit better) and a rasberry pi zero+battery. A scope like that would let you:<p>(i) Set up machine learning diagnostics for malaria/other blood borne pathogens/squamous cells. Right now it takes experts to diagnose most of these diseases and those experts need good scopes. If you had thousands of these scopes in the wild and took millions of images+diagnoses, you could really fire some high powered machine learning at it to get rapid, easy diagnoses. Presumably, if you had good automated diagnostic systems (kind of pie in the sky) you could also use this for epidemiology.<p>(ii) Sample monitoring for any kind of growth system. One could imagine a floating version of this that takes images every few minutes and keeps a count of the number of cells growing in a medium (in it&#x27;s FOV), the number/type of plankton/bacteria it could see, crystal formation etc. Basically any time a researcher wants to passively monitor a process, a cheap scope like this could be useful. You could even pair a pump or something to pull in and trap your sample as needed.<p>(iii) Water supply testing (for microbes). It&#x27;s possible you could use a system like this to take a quick sample of any water supple to decide if it&#x27;s potable. With a lot of people doing this you could monitor water supplies much more effectively.<p>2. A 30-50 dollar fluorescent microscope with camera. This is being worked on by several neuroscience labs. It&#x27;s around 100-1000 dollars depending on who you believe. This could be used for:<p>(i) Long term monitoring of cell firing in animal brains.<p>(ii) Monitoring chemi or bioflurescenct samples in vivo long term. Could be used for levels of compounds, disease progression, drug penetration and life time.<p>Basically this is stuff people are doing it would just make it much much cheaper and much more portable allowing longer term, higher throughput experiments.<p>Cheap scopes are everywhere, there are a number of decent ones you can buy and hook to your standard smartphone (though most are weak because as I said before, they basically have to &#x27;fix&#x27; your smartphone&#x27;s lens). You could even make a 10 dollar USB scope yourself by cracking open a webcam and flipping its optics. But mass produced, optically good scopes with cell level resolution in everyone&#x27;s hands (especially if they can easily capture those images) have the potential to make huge, really powerful databases of microscopy data. Right now computer vision in microscopy is horribly task focused, it would be cool to see what people could do with billions of diverse microscopy images.",1450478270

That study first looked at real-world hiring rates, which showed this 2:1 advantage and then tried to see whether the advantage was due to the women applicants being generally more qualified (which would obviously explain the empirical finding).  The study went on to show that superior qualifications were unlikely to be the cause for the real-world hiring advantages.<p>Note also that the departments selected in the study you cite were Psychology, Biology, Chemistry and Physics, not tech (Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Engineering in general).  In Biology women are the majority, in Chemistry the ratio is close to 50/50.

Another study (that I can&#x27;t find right now) showed that if the qualifications are noticeably different, gender and other factors play no role.

When you start to notice the sameness between ovals and circles and how they aren&#x27;t squares you start to get the notion.<p>When it comes to monads, it&#x27;s just the mechanics behind why some things, are intuitively composable. You don&#x27;t need the mechanics if you just get a feeling for it.<p>In linq this is the feeling that you can stack a bunch of from x in xs from y in ys from ... together and get sensible results without too much thinking. As long as the xs and ys implement SelectMany as a monad it doesn&#x27;t matter what it does, be it transforming collections, building sql queries or scheduling async tasks, the safe feeling will be there.<p>If you really want to do the math it might help to identify the level of abstraction we are talking about. For this I found it easier to reach for abstract algebra. Lookup the concept of a monoid and how it relates to you everyday arithmetic, it&#x27;s roughly the same abstraction leap as the difference between your code and the concept of monads.<p>Now, monads really are just monoids for a particular kind of binary operation and values. The problem is that understanding monoids in the context of multiplication and addition is easy, you already have good grasp of both the arithmetic and the algebra there. But the compositions that monads describe (kleisly arrows) are probably not something you think about most of the time.

You say &quot;the lights, cameras, and network connections are already installed and paid for&quot;, but how many intersections are that way?<p>More specifically, the numbers I showed are that a fully equipped signal, like what you want, costs $450,000, while a roundabout is cheaper. If all lights already have &quot;lights, cameras, and network connections&quot; then it&#x27;s a sunken cost. If 1% of the signals are that way, then it&#x27;s entirely different.<p>I certainly don&#x27;t know how interconnected the lights are. But even with hard numbers - and you haven&#x27;t made any claims to any numbers - that&#x27;s only a part of the point.

That&#x27;s not really helpful, other than to show there are a lot of dumb signals in the US.)<p>Yes, <i>construction</i> is cheaper <i>on average</i> for signals, but bear in mind that signals with &#x27;lights, cameras, and network connections&#x27; are definitely not average signals.<p>But construction is only part of the cost-benefit analysis. The signals need to be powered, and replaced about every 10 years according to one of the URLs I gave. Roundabouts have a 25 year lifetime. Roundabouts are also safer, so there the benefits to human life must be included. And as I pointed out, you also have to consider the failure modes.<p>Sure, yes, there&#x27;s &#x27;low hanging fruit&#x27; (which is a misnomer, as the really &#x27;low hanging fruit&#x27;, like traffic light coordination and in-pavement detectors, have long since been picked). But that&#x27;s because you have a goal in mind, which is to &quot;improve traffic signals&quot;, not &quot;improve traffic systems&quot; (which roundabouts do), or &quot;improve quality of life&quot; (which &#x27;complete streets&#x27; and livable community advocates want to do).<p>Thus, if you think that &#x27;&quot;The reductions of 40 percent in vehicle wait time, nearly 26 percent in travel time and 21 percent in projected vehicle emissions realized in this pilot are remarkable,&quot;&#x27; is a good justification, then you have to compare it to <i>other</i> solutions which achieve or improve upon those same goals, and not just cherry-pick (again with the fruit metaphors!) the numbers that best support your goal.<p>As I also pointed out, the pathway to more roundabouts isn&#x27;t to wholescale replace existing signals, but to use them for new intersections, and for those with high accident rates where it&#x27;s most worthwhile to switch. The over time, as the old signals need replacing, switch many of them to roundabouts.<p>That too &quot;would substantially improve things, even without an AI&quot;.",1450478117

Enter a starting and ending location, and it told us how to get there perfectly. Over the entire week we were there, we didn&#x27;t have any issues taking the wrong train.<p>- You pay by distance traveled by tapping a card when you enter the subway and again when you exit. Different from the systems in the US I&#x27;ve travelled (specifically Chicago) where you tap once at the beginning. Also impressed with how quickly the system read your card.<p>- The stations where you can make connections are labeled really well with arrows noting where to go next and how far away they are. However those connections can be really long distances. I think the longest was 700ish meters, a little under a half a mile. Seeing 400m on a sign seemed normal.<p>- Despite the distances between the connections, I don&#x27;t think we had to transfer more than once ever. The lines were very well related.<p>- The stations themselves covered a giant area under the ground and had a ton of numbered exits. Take the wrong exit and you could be a long way from where you were trying to go.

10761411,comment,10751007,10760670,0,0,Amezarak,,,"> On the Roman side there were zero casualties so it was more a genocide than a battle.<p>While it&#x27;s certainly true that it meets the definition of a genocide, it&#x27;s rather anachronistic to call it that. Ancient peoples did not possess our norms and values.<p>To the Romans, the Germanic and Celtic peoples represented an existential threat. And they were correct in that analysis. Periodically, for hundreds of years, German tribes the Romans had never even <i>heard</i> of came down into Italy in mass migrations looting and killing everyone in their path. The numbers involved were always absolutely <i>massive</i>, and in many respects the Germans were superior fighters. On several occasions the Romans survived only by the skin of their teeth. For various reasons, the cultural and demographics of the Germanic tribes provided them with a huge birthrate and rapid population growth, which led to pressure that eventually led to huge armed migrations. (Of course, war for pleasure and profit were also common, and later often they fled from even more numerous, warlike tribes, Germanic or otherwise.)<p>To say, as an aside, that &#x27;among these were women and children&#x27; is also a little disingenuous and anachronistic. Not only were women and children not regarded as particularly sacrosanct or immune from the horrors of war, the Germanic and Celtic peoples often included their women in their armies <i>on purpose</i> to prevent the men from retreating, to assist in whatever ways they could, and sometimes to fight. Sometimes the women in the rear merely mocked or pleaded with the men not to retreat. Sometimes they <i>killed them</i>.<p>I confess I am not intimately familiar with these particular tribes and this particular battle. But from a realpolitik point of view, Caesar was acting sensibly. Letting these tribes survive would be to the eventual detriment of Rome. They would eventually invade. No agreement with the Germanic peoples ever lasted long. Nothing less than genocide ever kept a tribe suppressed for more than decades or centuries.<p>In general, ancient peoples had a <i>very</i> different mindset than we do. Most of them regarded their ethnicity and culture as an absolutely bedrock part of their identity. For many of them, it was better to die as and for who they were than to live in submission - even peaceful submission - to a foreign people. This was true for both the Romans and many of the Germanic tribes. The Cimbri women, for example, killed their children and themselves rather than submit to the Romans. Indeed, the particularly strong Roman identity is one of the reasons for their early successes. The Romans often suffered devastating losses, both in absolute numbers and relative proportions of the Roman people, and refused to surrender or stop fighting where many other peoples did. We could probably, anachronistically, call the Romans and the Germans genocidal racists. But the only reason the Romans survived to become an empire and provide future generations with all their advancements and civilizations was <i>because</i> they were genocidal racists.<p>Of course, as time went on, and Rome became an empire, &#x27;Roman&#x27; became more of a national identity and less of an ethnic or cultural identity. This was correlated with what Roman conservatives thought of as mass decadence: for example,  the importation of foreign values, dress, and behaviors. The conservative outrage against homosexuals and transgendered people almost reads like something from the modern day. And the truly &#x27;Roman&#x27; part of the population became less of a factor due to lower birth rates (Romans had birth control and abortion, and probably also due to the increasingly large role of women in society). Perhaps consequently, Romans began seeing the military as less of a duty and more of a burden, particularly in conjunction with ever-ongoing wars, and the Roman military essentially became a mercenary army.<p>As time went on, German pressure on Roman borders became intolerable. Rome constantly meddled with the tribes to play them off against each other, but Germanic peoples remained a perpetual problem for the empire. Since Germans were incredibly effective fighters - born to military life, and often bigger and stronger than Romans, particularly as the empire became more &#x27;decadent&#x27; and commercial and academic activity became more common than warfare for the average citizen, Romans began to incorporate Germans into the military, both as auxiliaries and as actual members.<p>Then as Roman internal politics became increasingly complicated due to the changes in the governance structure, the economy, and interminable civil wars, the Roman military became less effective and the Romans often turned a mostly blind (and helpless) eye to Germanic migrations/invasions and sometimes encouraged them. Then, after several more crises, the Romans allowed a contingent of Germanic refugees fleeing from the Huns into the empire. Ultimately these Germans (the Goths) turned against the Romans (perhaps justifiably) and that was one of the primary proximate causes of the end of the western Roman empire.<p>...I suppose I went on a little there, but I like the subject and I recently finished Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. :)",1450477621

All new theories that can garner such enthusiasm for their presentation are invariably bolstered by something.  No-one writes magazine articles about ambiguous signals from an exciting new theory.  If the evidence presented is not in some way definitive, then it should be viewed as a precondition for the propagation of the theory, not evidence in favour of it.  Few of us are expert judges of neurological theories, and we are not able to tell if there is anything substantial beyond the <i>feeling</i> that we experience that something valuable has been learned.<p>I know that the effects of Ketamine in treating serious episodic depression are very exciting.  I feel that I understand enough to suggest that neuroplasticity is not an especially &#x27;new&#x27; theory, or a &#x27;theory&#x27; by itself.  The neuroplastic response is real, well documented, and undisputed.  What <i>is</i> a theory, and had not been established as fact, the last time I discussed it with someone, is that idea that the neuroplastic response is the central intermediary between the physical effect of the drug and the clinical effect of the drug.  It occurs, but it had not been established that it is causal.<p>The central suggestion regarding the &#x27;vaccine&#x27; effect seemed to be buried a bit in the article (unless I missed something in skimming), but it is the actual new information, which is interesting and heartening.  Soldiers coming to a forward operating medical station with severe burns were treated with Ketamine rather than another anaesthetic because of its relative safety.  They subsequently developed PTSD half as often as all soldiers and civilians treated for less or equally severe burns with other anaesthetics.<p>On the basis of the theory that PTSD and depression emerge an erosion of neurosynaptic connections, the leap is made from there to the idea that Ketamine  might perhaps serve as a true &#x27;vaccine&#x27; when people were going into high-stress situations.  From  my relatively uneducated perspective, this seems a bit irresponsible in two separate ways.<p>Firstly, the evidence is that the soldiers were &#x27;vaccinated&#x27; against psychological disturbances associated with extreme trauma...   after the initial extreme trauma had occurred.  There is evidence from studies with mice that a Ketamine treatment changes their response to stressors in a way that seems both dramatic and positive.  Ketamine is a common recreational drug.  If we should be excited about the prospect of this response being replicated in humans, then why is there not already ample evidence that this response is replicated in humans?<p>Secondly, there is absolutely no reason that we should conclude that the effect of the Ketamine on the burn victims has anything to do with neuroplastic response.  Ketamine is <i>an anesthetic</i>.  It limits pain, which is traumatic.  Anesthetics operate in different ways.  Ketamine seems to inhibit the transmission of pain signals in the spinal cord.  This prevents them from reaching the limbic system.  Other forms of anesthesia may not.  Ketamine is, infamously, <i>an amnesic and a dissociative</i>.  Stress disorders require memory formation.  Ketamine prevents memory formation.  Other forms of anesthesia may not.  And so on.  In the context of the surfeit of plausible explanations for this effect, to suggest that the effect is particular evidence supporting a theory that PTSD is cured by neuroplastic regeneration of synaptic connections is not particularly responsible.  It might not be terrible journalism, but it is definitely bad science, and almost certainly not something that was presented as science to the journalist.",1450477555

Since your comment is so detailed let me go into a bit of the thinking behind it.<p>One of the leading goals I&#x27;ve been following is design by subtraction. The idea that you should take away everything but the core gameplay and let that drive the game. So the format settled on focusing just on the color matching gameplay and each gate that comes adds its own mixup of the core. There were times when I tried messing with the core gameplay and tried some more complexity, but it just didn&#x27;t feel like BoxByte anymore.<p>It could always use some more polish, I&#x27;m really a one man team though so it&#x27;s been a struggle to get even what I have lol.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s up with the warning. I think that&#x27;s just a Unity thing because there&#x27;s no actual networking code in the game itself.<p>I agree about the text. I find ui design to be some of the most boring work involved with a game so there are some instances where the ui could definitely be better.<p>The tutorial seems to be something that people are the most divided on. Some people really like it and some really hate it. I just think that&#x27;s how it goes with tutorials. No one wants to be stuck reading when they want to be playing. But I found it was really important for people to understand the game. I tried to make it as short as I could if that helps :)<p>It&#x27;s funny that you mention those three, because every one of those had significant changes in the past three months. Ultimately the game is one big challenge though, so what I did was try to focus on what the hardcore BoxByte player would want. The downside of course is that there are a lot of cool things later on in the game that some players will never see. In the end I just didn&#x27;t want to make it easier at a detriment to those core players who will play it most.<p>I really would have liked to have had more puzzles, but it&#x27;s mostly a game about skill and tactics. However I don&#x27;t agree about there being artificial difficulty. But I definitely think it could be too hard and that&#x27;s part of the reason I&#x27;m posting this to hear experiences.<p>What makes you think it&#x27;s a general sci-fi world? It&#x27;s actually a very dark oppressive world. Is there a game world? ;)<p>I can&#x27;t comment much on the background, I&#x27;ve already said too much on the world... But all is not as it seems...<p>About the score, I guess it could be handled better. But it&#x27;s really meant to be a kind of goal. I don&#x27;t really want to gravitate towards a kind of participation award though. Of course that leaves it with some sharp edges but that&#x27;s part of what makes it BoxByte. It&#x27;s unforgiving but always fair.<p>With a game like BoxByte I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s something that can cater well to every demographic. I definitely made efforts to try to smooth it out, but in some cases I decided to leave it as is and hopefully the demographic that likes it will like it more for that.<p>Having said that, I might be completely off. This isn&#x27;t an exact science after all. In that case I&#x27;m definitely willing accept that and take input :)",1450477554

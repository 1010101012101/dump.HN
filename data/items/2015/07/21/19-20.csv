But...it certainly will help.<p>The dependency would look like:<p><pre><code>  stats <- measure-theoretic prob. <- math. analysis\n</code></pre>\nThe problem with dumping the measure-theoretic probability is that you won&#x27;t really <i>know</i> what a random variable is.  It has a definition (a measurable function into the reals), and without that, you will have a tendency to think of it as &quot;a box that produces something random when you look into it&quot;.  This will limit your ability to understand papers, and will make you insecure in talking to people.<p>Besides &quot;random variable&quot;, other common notions will also be hard to understand without measure-theoretic probability, like &quot;almost surely&quot;, convergence concepts, the difference between the SLLN and WLLN, etc.<p>The problem with dumping analysis is that you will not know some basic things like what a continuous function is.  What is everywhere continuous?  What is a C1 function?  And again, you will have a hard time reading and speaking.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I found analysis to be not that fun, but measure-theoretic probability to be really a fun, tight, theory.

We talked about this, and Musk seemed convinced that human-level consciousness is a black-and-white thing—that it’s like a switch that flips on at some point in the evolutionary process and that no other animals share.

I think you would be in compliance with AGPL if you had an internal server run the AGPL program and then had your external servers communicate with the internal AGPL running servers to perform work. As long as the web user was not communicating directly with the AGPL, the user to whom you would have to release your modified source is yourself since the outside user never communicates directly.<p>Next, the AGPL is and will be a very small percentage of GPL licensed software.<p>Finally, apart from making a political statement, I do not see the AGPL getting any traction. Apart from MongoDB (which has its drivers as Apache) I cannot think of any widely used software that is AGPL.<p>Also, note that while MongoDB is AGPL, if you look at the contributor license (<a href=""https://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mongodb.com/legal/contributor-agreement</a>) any contributor is giving MongoDB the right to use and license your contribution and to make derivative works of which they are the sole owner. They can also license your code under a non-copyleft license to others. I do not see how in this case a (A)GPL is more free than a BSD/MIT license. Along this line, you will see that many successfull GPL projects (excepting Linux and the FSF ones) are of this type where the source code is GPL but any contributions give some type of copyright assignment to the company which then sells basically closed-source licenses to corporations who don&#x27;t want the GPL.<p>edit: Rewrote first point.",1437506339

(For instance, the AGPL closes this loophole.)<p>Legal departments understand that using GPL code in proprietary services violates the &quot;spirit&quot; of the GPL, which is why they want to shy away from it.<p>It&#x27;s especially thorny because if say, a contractor logs into the server that&#x27;s running your SaaS, and your SaaS is linked against a GPL library, technically that&#x27;s a distribution event (because the contractor works for another company, and now you distributed it to him), and now your SaaS has to be licensed under the GPL too.  Oops.<p>When you consider all this, there&#x27;s no wonder large companies just make blanket policies of no GPL, ever.  And the GPLed works out there suffer, because those same large companies are happy to use permissively-licensed libraries, make fixes, and push those fixes upstream.

See for instance <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18502705/how-to-know-a-specifix-launchd-plist-file-location"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18502705/how-to-know-a-sp...</a> -- this can make it difficult to troubleshoot a startup issue or get a handle on what is and isn&#x27;t being started and when.<p>2. .plist files are a binary format, ostensibly to save space, which seems a little bit ridiculous on an operating system like recent versions of MacOS X. So you have to use a separate set of tools just to interact with them. This also means that it&#x27;s harder to fix corruption of .plist files or troubleshoot strange values they may have; in a plain text format, you&#x27;d just open it up in vi or emacs or whatever, and if you know what you&#x27;re doing, you could find and fix anything that doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>3. The XML format in general isn&#x27;t a very nice way to handle configuration files. Unless you&#x27;ve got syntax highlighting, it&#x27;s hard to read.<p>4. Complex declarative configuration files aren&#x27;t my favorite thing regardless, because it&#x27;s hard to know what your options are and what the right values for those options are. With simple configuration systems where there is are several sets of values, and each set of values has the same half-dozen or so options, it&#x27;s not so bad. But, in cases where you can have hundreds of different options, and not all of them documented well, an optimal configuration can turn in to a bit of black magic.<p>I guess maybe #4 doesn&#x27;t really apply directly to .plists, since they&#x27;re not intended to be edited by the user, they&#x27;re intended to just be for application developers.

Bringing up the word &quot;bikeshedding&quot; when discussing putting people in danger of death is just something I can not agree with.<p>> Yeah, maybe there was a case when a couple peoples&#x27; lives were at stake but nothing happened.<p>This is exactly why I so vehemently disagree. If we found all the people who were in traffic with them at the time, do you think they&#x27;d agree that doing experiments in public traffic next to them is a purely aesthetical issue? Recklessness isn&#x27;t defined by the outcome, but by the possible outcome.<p>> The real issue is that tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of peoples&#x27; lives are at stake RIGHT NOW, under conditions that are much less controlled than what people are deriding as uncontrolled conditions. But people are griping about the 1-2 instead of the 10,000-400,000.<p>Yes, and I&#x27;m saying both are very important issues. Experiments on public roads in actual traffic are something that should not ever happen. I&#x27;m also not sure I&#x27;d put the amount of people they endangered in the 1-2 range, since there was at least one other person in the car, one in the truck behind, and others in the cars that passed them.<p>I also wouldn&#x27;t go so far as calling this controlled, since that usually means a controlled setting, safety precautions and such.<p>> How is this not dead simple to understand? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>As said, I do understand, I just disagree. It would also make it much easier to talk about this if you weren&#x27;t trying to insult me and others.<p>I agree that the flaw itself is a very big issue. I disagree that the way the experiment was done isn&#x27;t. And nobody here is arguing that it&#x27;s good that the cars have that fault, so it&#x27;s quite natural for the discussion here to be around topics people disagree on.<p>You know what the perfect location and media would have been for such an experiment?

I dont recall gcc or any of the other commercial compilers having this expansionary vision of a compiler stack back in the 2000s.

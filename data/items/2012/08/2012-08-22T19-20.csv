But I can hear 18 m68k afficianados crying out in pain that the new toolchain doesn't work on their NetBSD system, or the guy who wrote his own C compiler that needs some extra rules feeling totally shafted because now he was to write M4 and ""M5,"" which for some reason he cannot stand any more than M4 even thought it looks nothing alike.<p>We stand unified. Not by good things. But by the woe we all suffer. To those out there seeking to crush that & make better, I wish you the best! Please keep in mind a simple mantra as you go about inventing the future, do no harm. Libtool maybe awful but it's how distributions are made.<p>phkamp, sorry for missing the reply. M4 is ugly, libtool takes forever, everything in it is a hack. It's proven to be an at least adequately flexible hack that has kept *nix unified, more or less.

On the one hand, no one can argue with the idea that it takes a ton of work in many different areas to create a successful business. However, this doesn't mean that there's no such thing as a tipping point.<p>In my experience, many of my projects build on each other, and in many cases the true benefit of each project isn't clear until some critical mass of other projects have also been completed. For example, I spent the first few months of my business making what I thought was a pretty good product, but when I launched it, no one signed up. It turns out that my landing page sucked, I did a terrible job of onboarding the user, and the product didn't come with the right default settings. All of those things were important, but when I finished the last one, all of a sudden free trial users started turning into subscribers. That final project wasn't actually ""that one thing"" but it looked that way because it was the straw that broke the camels back.<p>So yes, there's probably not a ""one thing"" that will be responsible for taking you to the next level, but there will possibly be ""one thing"" that puts the finishing touch on a massive body of prior work.

Finding one investor bold enough to put in at a $60 basis is completely different from publicly trading at a $60 basis.<p>After the company goes through $XX million of funding, gets closer to its goal, but the industry and stock market don't value it, you may have singlehandedly helped it go to $45 instead of $0.01, but you don't make out, period.<p>My understanding is that you can sometimes sell the option for fair market price once it vests (again, publicly traded at that point?), so worrying about how high the strike price is is the least of your problems with this deal.<p>These deals often have ""vest at the board of directors' discretion"", ""fire before vesting"" and dilution gotchas that leave you holding the bag (an empty bag) when it's time to pay you.  Keep a close eye on those.<p>The reason to issue options at market value is to avoid you getting a tax bill right away (for income you don't get to spend).  If you do take the deal, be sure you file the correct tax form immediately to keep that tax liability away.<p>Hopefully this is a great position with great salary, because at $60 this company's mature enough that without a major breakout and savvy business CEO, the options are lottery tickets.",1345665006

August 21, 2012  Prof. Yael Hochberg and 2012 MBA graduate Kristen Kamath of Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management, in cooperation with  media partner Tech Cocktail (tech.co), set out to determine the best startup accelerator programs in America and rank the top 15. Sitting atop this years list was Y Combinator, followed by TechStars Boulder and KickLabs respectively. This is the second year of the report, which was initiated in 2011 with Aziz Gilani, Director at DFJ Mercury.<p>In addition to the announcement of the top accelerators, Tech Cocktail is offering a free report to
entrepreneurs, sponsored by .CO Internet, the company behind the fast-growing .CO domain, titled, A Guide to Choosing the Best Tech Accelerator for Your Startup.  This report will be available for download exclusively at tech.co, at the bottom of the accelerator rankings article. Topics covered in the report include analysis and advice on funding, mentorship, geography, network strength, and alternative startup programs.<p>With the explosion of startup accelerators in the past couple of years, there are many options for entrepreneurs to sift through and no real resources to help find the right program for them, said Frank Gruber, co-founder and CEO of Tech Cocktail. Our goal in working with Prof. Hochbergs team was to create an objective ranking that we could couple with our own research to create a more in-depth look at the various programs out there. There are many people who don't know what accelerators are or how to select one. We think the ranking created by Prof. Hochbergs research team and the report created by Tech Cocktail provide an extremely valuable resource.<p>See the full release at http://tech.co/top-startup-accelerators-ranked-2012-08",1345663497

But after reading and understanding it (it's not very well explained there) seems like a much more abstract thing. They want to build an abstraction layer to the social web, not a social network.<p>The idea seems pretty good. It's just the basics: you follow people and receive their content (text, images, whatever), and people follow you and you share content with them. The most amazing thing is that, just using these simple concepts  the possibilities are infinite. As they said, every social network out there can be implemented in this way. Twitter? It's trivial, just make the format description and you're ready. Facebook? The only thing you should specify is that the relationships are symmetric (you can follow me only if I decide to follow you too, that is, we are mutual friends).<p>To me, the idea seems absolutely great. The problem will be execution: what apps are created using this protocol. I have also the doubt if apps will be interoperable. Example: I build a twitter-like app named Foo and another guy builds another twitter-like app named Bar. Both use similar formats, so, can an user using Foo see the contents posted with Bar? I imagine that this will be possible as long as they share the same post format, but I'm not sure.<p>Anyways, good work. I would really like to see Tent to expand and grow.",1345663020

Even when the <i>quality</i> of JCS or TV exceeds TB or MD, it's not going to be reflected in the ratings.<p>Adjustments such as taking a Likert (3-7 point scale) and adjusting reviews based on the number of reviewers, to give both the actual <i>qualitative</i> assessment, and the <i>probable maximal review</i> can help.  This is how sites such as Reddit have adjusted their comments/submissions ratings.<p>The broader and more philosophical problem is that ""quality"" is not a one-dimensional attribute, interpretation of quality differs among individuals, and ""fitness for purpose or task"" should be considered when assessing quality as well.

In some ways if Fukushima was a result of human error (as that report indicates), then that's positive: it's resolvable.  But if we scaled nuclear power up to 10x what it currently is I would worry about more human error, and introducing nuclear power to places that have even more problems with reliability, or cultural problems with creating reliable systems.  A nuclear power plant in Nigeria?  I'm sure there are very reliable people who could staff and monitor the plant, and that those people could be attracted to the jobs, but I don't trust the political infrastructure of the nation to ensure that all actually happens.

But please read the following with full consideration of the biases of age, from which youth is wonderfully immune.<p>Agile is essentially about shortening feedback cycles.  The problem with waterfall was that work products were reviewed when 'complete', when change costs were high and commitments large.  Decompose the work products into smaller chunks (backlog items and tasks) and review more frequently -- Sprints (every N weeks), standups (daily), pair programming (realtime).  Every work product in a waterfall cycle, not just code, can be decomposed into smaller tasks -- design documents etc. can be constructed iteratively and incrementally, in parallel or sequentially (the latter meaning you can overlay Agile on top of waterfall) with tight and layered feedback cycles.<p>There are many artifacts, but dwelling on their structure and nature without reference to their essential role leads to superficial criticisms.<p>When something is broken in Agile always return to the fundamental question of how well the feedback cycle is working and how to fix it.  Sprint reviews not providing value?  Are they being used for feedback or have they become demo days?  Has the standup become a daily status report?",1345662568

If you like a song they look at other users who liked that song and try to find more songs/bands from the people with your taste. And the other way around for dislike i guess.<p>It works exceptionally well. You just listen to the stream of incoming songs, you never pick songs yourself. After a good song you click like, after a mediocre song you keep listening, during a bad song you click skip. After a few days you will only get good songs!

Whilst it's true that inserts are not immediately written by default, you can a) change the startup config to set the delay time b) force a write of all pending changes from the command line c) force the write from your call to the insert/update/remove/etc method in all the libraries and most importantly, d) request the library method wait and return the response from MongoDB so you can determine if the write was successful or not.<p>This means you have complete control over when you need fast inserts at the expense of potential data loss, or when you need to be certain the data has been written.",1282841502

Controller can use Model to do this.  Controller creates/manages views and sends latest data to the Views.<p>And a confusion-reducer: Controller is not between Model and Views.  Views have direct access to Model.  It ONLY uses Model to figure out the situation.<p>I have found these clear separations helpful in a variety of applications.  I have also found that people that apply MVC to the web confuse themselves, too.  On the server side, your View is what you are returning to the browser.  JavaScript is part of the View of the server.  It has its own MVC when it is run in the browser environment, and the browser has its own MVC.  It is perfectly acceptable to have interlocking components, each with their own MVC.",1282841146

On closer examination I see it has been updated more recently.<p>How much of the hardware compatibility can be accurately tested in the emulator. I haven't run into hardware issues on my applications, but I don't have the wide device exposure I'd like to have. So I don't really have experience in having something slip by the emulator.<p>I think it depends largely on your type of app. Business/utility applications are less likely to be affected than games. Anything that uses a service is going to run into issues, and anything directly controlling hardware (camera, sensors). The quirks are definitely there, but I think they impact a much smaller group than people like to claim.<p>A service for testing would be good - $x/hr to load on X devices and click certain buttons. It'd have to be cheap, though, or most developers would probably simply opt for market-based testing. You'd probably have to offshore it to get a decent cost.<p>I wonder if you could get a decent response farming this out on the Turk or similar.",1282841066

On the one hand it is an interesting idea, on the other it creates a lot of friction with respect to users creating fully-functioning accounts. The process is so onerous (by web-standards, mind you), that it'll be tough to get many users participating at the outset on a nascent site.<p>I'd also consider narrowing or focusing on a specific topical niche (possibly with a better brand-name that might give a n00b some hints about what the site is and what it can do).<p>I see you have also seeded the site with some content, but you may also need to artificially seed the site with some user participation (via ""fake"" accounts). I know this runs counter to your idea of ""real/verified"" users, but one of the toughest things about growing a userbase is convincing people that there's some worthwhile activity going on at your site to begin with. If they arrive and there's no discussion taking place, most of them will just as soon leave (there's no compelling reason for them to register to comment to nobody when they can just as soon go register at reddit or hacker news to talk to folks).<p>You should also look at using SEO urls for a lot of your pages. So rather than <a href=""http://lonava.com/stories/314687"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lonava.com/stories/314687</a>, use a url like <a href=""http://lonava.com/stories/sonys-hirai-were-over-10-years-from-a-discless-ps3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lonava.com/stories/sonys-hirai-were-over-10-years-fro...</a><p>Once you fix some of the simple stuff, you can start taking a crack at things like link-building, link-bait, link exchanges, forum postings, ad-word campaigns and viral strategies.<p>So I have no panacea for you. Growing an audience can sometimes require a number of small tactical moves.<p>One last thought: In a prior job I had worked on an account verification product. There many, many companies out there who are interested in such technologies for a variety of purposes (usually for financial transactions). Your application may have a hidden gem beneath the surface that is more valuable than the aggregator: the identity verification component.

Without another layer of abstraction to keep database-content-specific code out of your controllers, you end up with:<p><i>db -> orm -> 100,000 flat-level queries tied directly to the format returned by the orm</i><p>With abstraction like they suggest, you can achieve:<p><i>db -> orm -> [your organization method here] -> your never-changing data you requested</i><p>Significantly better if you're working at that scale, and if you ever need to change your DB/ORM.  In a situation like that, I wholly agree: there should be <i>zero</i> ORM-tied code in your controller.<p>BUT: tutorials are rarely-if-ever for people working at that scale.  You <i>should</i> have <i>some</i> grasp of what you're doing if you're attacking a problem of that scale, or at <i>least</i> be beyond the tutorial stage.

Once you understand why, it's merely annoying; before that, you really can't know if you're supposed to use an interface, inherit from Object or Array or GenericArrayListWithBellsAndWhistlesRadixSorted, or just code the damn thing by hand.<p>ORM tutorials are for coding the damn thing by hand, a necessary starting point for building that scalable abstracted structure, and the foundation of it.

1636317,comment,1636113,1636113,0,0,aplusbi,,,"This reminds me a story...<p>At my last job we used Postgres on a Windows server.  Whoever initially set up the database pretty much stuck to the defaults.<p>Whenever we would read/write text to the db in code we were using functions that basically returned raw data.  All of our text was encoding using UTF-8.<p>When using the Windows Postgres Admin tool to run a query that returned text, you'd occasionally see some weird characters (cafÃ©), sometimes you wouldn't (café).  Sometimes the query would fail due to invalid characters.<p>When I looked into it I quickly realized what was wrong - on Windows Postgres defaults to Win1252 encoding (which is a form of extended ascii).  Normally when you are writing text to the database Postgres will convert the encoding but since we were writing raw bytes we skipped this part.<p>Win1252 contains some undisplayable characters which occasionally show up in a multi-byte UTF-8 character, explaining the failed queries.  However it didn't explain why sometimes we got cafÃ© and sometimes we got café.<p>It turned out that there were some scripts/apps that were reading file names on Windows and inserting them into the database without converting it to UTF-8.  Windows uses UTF-16, although somewhere this was auto-magically being converted to Win1252.<p>This meant that our Win1252 encoded database contained both Win1252 text and UTF-8 text.  I ended up doing a text dump of the database and writing a Perl script that would run through it all byte-by-byte and convert all characters above ascii 127 that were not part of valid UTF-8 sequences into UTF-8.  This was then used to create a new database correctly encoded as UTF-8.  It actually worked (although there were a few snags - we were getting some data from this service that would randomly include the sub character (ctrl-z) occasionally which would cause cat/split to stop running).",1282838750

For instance, XMLHttpRequest was a fricking cool innovation.<p>MS's problem traditionally has been that it doesn't open the spec for these sorts of things until much later, if at all. This is a tendency Google does not really share when it adds features to Chrome. For instance, before Google officially started working on Web Intents, an employee of theirs and one from Mozilla came up with different ideas for how intents should be handled. They agreed on a preliminary spec and now that spec is open for anyone to implement.",1312541850

I am not a conspiracy theorist, raging internet commenter, etc. I was actually fairly upset by the reaction to my post. I found the replies, and the downvoting, for the most part failed to take my point (though it wasn't spelled out) for what it was: 'pics or it didn't happen' is meant to be the reaction of both an assiduous journalist, and an intelligent reader when faced with a story given like this. I am not more informed as to the facts of the story than the author was - I can't offer counterpoints. What I can do, and what I didn't see displayed by a community I broadly have high respect for, is spot telltales of very bad journalism when I see it. Any scientific article posted here that doesn't link to the original paper, that doesn't question or review what it is discussing, generally attracts similar points. Why, on a story about the US seizing and executing Osama (in quite an unexpected manner!), does anybody effectively doing the same get turned upon so severely? You'll notice that the 'bollocks' post starts with an explanation of something in the story gives cause for concern as to consistency which neither author nor readers seem concerned with.

As a former musician I recognize it in the shape of ""technique ruins your soul"" or how one would like to phrase it.<p>I think that the dichotomy is just wrong. It's not  detailed knowledge versus pragmatic solution. I spent a great amount of my time in environments where the ""shipping it"" dominated ""understand what you are doing"", and I also spent time with drummers who could not keep the time because practicing would ruin their soul. It's knowledge vs. ignorance.<p>What concerns software development: the essence you want to get back to smells to me like the vbscript world I was happy to turn my back to.

2849648,comment,2849390,2849588,1,0,hencq,,,"I'll try to tackle the first two :-)<p>A lambda is an anonymous function; it's a function that doesn't have a name. Of course you can assign it to a variable if you like to. So for example in Javascript these two are equivalent:<p><pre><code>  function foo(arg) {//function body}\n  foo = function(arg) {//function body}\n</code></pre>\nOr in Python<p><pre><code>  def foo():\n    return 42\n  foo = lambda: 42\n</code></pre>\nNote that functions (and lambdas) are 'first class citizens'. This means we can pass functions around like any other type of value. You could sort of compare this to function pointers.<p>Now a closure is related to these first class functions. It's basically a function that carries with it, the environment from when it was defined. Consider this Python/pseudocode:<p><pre><code>  def foo():\n    a = 42\n    def bar():\n      return a\n    return bar\n\n  myClosure = foo()\n  myClosure() #this returns 42\n</code></pre>\nThe function foo returns a function that we assign to myClosure (in the function foo we named it bar, but we could have used an anonymous lambda as well). The returned function returns the value of <i>a</i>, but note that <i>a</i> was only around when we defined bar. When we call myClosure, it takes the value for a from the environment when it was defined.<p>So, lambdas and closures are not the same thing, but they're both related to first class functions. In practice when a language supports first class functions, it tends to support lambdas and closures as well.<p>Monads are something different again. They're used in purely functional languages (such as Haskell) to work with state. However, that's about as far as my knowledge goes so someone else can try explain that :-)",1312540810

Very, very neat.<p>The same thing can be done for wikipedia readers. A wikipedia link launches your app. In the same way other apps can provide intents for music selection, playback, data-sources, data-consumers and god knows what. Or just have an app become the default for some action on your system by handling the generic intent (i.e. surf the web).<p>Intents are one of the <i>really</i> good things which makes Android Android.

Map & reduce are concepts from functional programming, usually explained in Scheme or Haskell.  MapReduce is a C++ framework.  To go from one to another, you not only need to understand the nitty-gritty engineering details, but you also need to understand the fundamental computing concepts well enough to translate them into languages and use-cases that they weren't originally intended for.<p>(Side note: the MapReduce framework actually bears less resemblance to map & reduce than most people think.  The ""map"" phase is a combination map & unfold, because you're not only iterating over the input, but you can output multiple times for a given input element.  Think of running a word count over web pages: you have to parse the page and output multiple words per page.  And the ""reduce"" phase is only a reduce within keys: it's really a map between keys, because the output is required to have the same keys as the input to the phase.  I've often wished for a separate ""re-key"" phase, where the values output from the reduce phase could be reshuffled under a different key.)",1312539047

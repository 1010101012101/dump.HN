2235218,comment,2234185,2234185,0,0,dhimes,,,"Oh, Christ.  Not again.<p>This idea circulates every now and then, often as a result of a VC post somewhere.  Look:  VCs sit on the other side of the table from the founders.  It is <i>their job</i> to convince the founders that their ideas have little value and that the value lies in what they bring to the table.  Your are a fool if you believe them.  One rather notable startup invester has gone so far as to state that if you tell him your idea it is perfectly acceptable for him to give your idea to another group of founders to execute.  It's not stealing, because the idea is of no value.<p>See how that works?<p>He has apparently executed on this threat, too.<p>But if you start negotiating for serious money (valuations of tens of millions or more), you need a strong barrier to entry for the competition.  Often, very often, that is a patentable (or patented) idea or technology.<p>On the flip side, maybe you can think of products whose initial execution wasn't so great but whose idea was <i>so compelling</i> that the product was a success anyway.  I won't list what comes to my mind because I don't want to start a fanboi flamewar here, but you may be able to think of a few.<p>Believe the ""execution is everything"" myth at your own risk.  Ideas are <i>very important.</i>  Ideas are what change the direction of how we think about ourselves and how we live in the world.  In fact, I would say that some ideas compel their execution.  So, in my view, the moral is:  if you have a good idea you better be able to execute it, because if you can't somebody else will.",1298033911

2235212,comment,2234712,2234981,0,0,brc,,,"Because Australia doesn't have many of the diseases and pests that the rest of the world has.  For example, Australia is one of the few places on the world where bee colonies are free from the mite that has devastated hives the world over.  Australian beekeepers are now exporting to the USA, and it's these imported bees that are keeping the industry alive.<p>One english settler decided, in the 1830s or so, to release a small hutch of rabbits so they could scamper around his property and he'd be able to take potshots at them for fun.  The rabbits went on to systematically destroy most of the arable land in the country.<p>It's not only the agricultural industries.  Many of the unique Australian wildlife has never been subjected to common animals from the rest of the world.  The fox decimates native mammal populations.<p>I could go on and on.  There was a fire ant quarantine breach a few years back and they literally hunted down every nest and colony that had occured and (I think) have re-declared fire ant free.<p>So, if you're travelling to Australia, don't treat it as some sort of TSA impost.  Be thankful that people are there protecting the borders so you have some unique animals, and fantastic food quality to come and see.<p>Fun fact : I have a friend who is a dog handler in an Australian airport.  The worst offenders are little old ladies of either asian or middle eastern origin.  They're always carrying some noxious weed as part of an old family recipe to cook for their descendents who have settled in Australia.  So if you see someone with a dog bailing up an old lady in an Airport, you know why.<p>On the plus side - they will clean your boots for you, free of charge - they do a fine job of it as well. Unless you're trying to hide your muddy boots, then you'll get fined a couple of hundred bucks for being sneaky.  Best to declare your boots and get them cleaned for you.",1298033793

Countries like Singapore met the requirement and are included, countries like Brazil, China, and India don't. This isn't elementary school anymore, you expect diplomats to act diplomats and get policies enacted, not come up with some stupid scheme even a 10 year old could see through.<p>What the politicians should be doing is saying, ""we want to be part of Vfw too, what can we do to get there?"" and not, ""the US gov't don't like us, so we won't like them!"" Instead of trying to work closer together, this policy only makes the divide bigger.

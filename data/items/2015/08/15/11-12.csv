So, the mathematical\nsymbols do not replace the natural\nlanguage, e.g., English in the sentences,\nparagraphs, sections, chapters, etc.\nUsually good mathematical notation\nhas some mnemonic hints of the meaning,\nbut, still, the meaning is in the\ntext, not the symbols.

A metaphor can be seen in the Matrix. To quote Morpheus:<p>> The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you&#x27;re inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.<p>The hacker culture is being co-opted wholesale. Technology is powerful—both as an economic driver and a competitive advantage against other groups—, so it&#x27;s not unexpected that the human capital which are tech savvy are targeted.<p>People can&#x27;t be forced to do anything—unless they break the law at which point they will have the full force of law brought down upon them, with no mercy applied (if members of the gov choose!). As such, people with skills need to be <i>convinced</i> to work with government, and that&#x27;s where the rhetorical tools are implemented.<p>When you read comments about how governments help the people they preside over, you&#x27;re reading the grass-roots propaganda from those which Morpheus talks of. The <i>businessmen</i>, teachers, lawyers, carpenters, <i>coders</i>!<p>Do as you like, but it&#x27;s important to know the message conveyed in the blog post is from a member of the business-class who has been fully co-opted, and doesn&#x27;t follow the <i>very</i> advice he gives! And why would he? It&#x27;s much more profitable (in the board sense of the word) to use his platform as a tool of marketing and persuasion for said establishment—I.e. getting others to make sacrifices, so those with control can live with impunity and in-group-largess (with the cost borne by society).",1439636998

And if you need more for less important stuff like Terms of Service, FAQ or anything you could imagine, there is still an overflow button, which is kinda like a hamburger menu, but at least you have a few items without clicking a second time - and you see them instantly. On a usual hamburger menu you can&#x27;t even see your options without opening it, which increased my bounce rate on gaumengut.at by 80%.<p>I noticed that position:fixed is a bit awkward when pinch-zooming on mobile, but what are other and better alternatives?

The difference is that Cardanos equation might make use of complex numbers but in the end, returns a real solution whereas the quadratic solver remains complex whenever D < 0.<p>So in order to implement qubic equations you&#x27;d need (a) support for complex numbers, even though the final solution might be real and (b) support for reducing (square and higher order) roots. (b) would be a very valuable addition, as it also allows you to incorporate equations like x^2 - 2 = 0 which solves to x = sqrt(2) or x = -sqrt(2).",1439636592

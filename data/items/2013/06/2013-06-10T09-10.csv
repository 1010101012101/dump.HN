Customers typically do not have root access to their VM&#x27;s unless they supply their own keys/x509 certs so we can take ours off.  If we are managing the box we have, for example, stored root passwords (rarely needed and only two people have access) encrypted in PostgreSQL (which means we do not log when we are not debugging and we do not allow history to be stored since manual keys must be entered when retrieving this info).<p>> How are you managing images? I mean, that&#x27;s the thing you&#x27;ve gotta watch for, a backdoor in the install image.<p>It&#x27;s not the only thing you have to watch out for.  If someone can compromise the host they should be able to compromise all vm&#x27;s given a little time.  We do have some automated ways of checking for changes though.  In general the physical hosts are much less exposed but cannot guarantee that more generally.  We are always discussing ways to tighten security (I am considering setting up a rediculously tight selinux policy on the physical hosts).<p>> It does seem like having your own physical hardware would make... a big difference, security-wise.<p>The big difference is actually where the hardware is located.  The big difference is really having your own physical hardware on your own premises on your own intranet vs using someone else&#x27;s physical hardware in their datacenter, with their intranet.  In general though if you have someone else&#x27;s hardware on your intranet you can better control it than if you have your hardware somewhere else.",1370858365

You can already see that  Obama has gone on record saying that &quot;we cannot fight against terror without giving away some of our freedoms&quot; (or something very similar to this, I&#x27;m too lazy to search for the exact quote), a statement which he couldn&#x27;t have made before this scandal.<p>What&#x27;s really more disconcerting are all those comments (reasonably highly voted) coming from what seem to be genuine American citizens saying something very similar to what Obama is saying: &quot;We can&#x27;t fight terrorism if we don&#x27;t let the Government go through our stuff&quot;.<p>A little bit OT, I&#x27;m surprised nobody has yet made a parallel between present-days United States and the end times of the Roman Republic. You just have to replace today&#x27;s &quot;terrorists&quot; with the &quot;Barbarians/Germans&quot; of that time and Julius Caesar with today&#x27;s over-reaching Government. The bad news is that for all of Brutus&#x27;s and Cicero&#x27;s efforts Caesar was followed by future emperor Augustus and the end of the Roman Republic.",1370858277

For safety, the average human being is still quite prepared to use lethal violence. Safety includes security, employment, resources, morality, and health. Then less violence is used up the pyramid. And so on you go to love/belonging, esteem (where the respect comes in), and lastly self-actualization.<p>Of course this is only one theory. Other theories are based more on imitation (people will fight/use violence in a specific situation because they see others using violence in similar situations). That one is my personal favourite since it makes a whole lot more sense than the psychological theory. How would you store something as complex as Maslow&#x27;s pyramid in genes ? There is no room for anything so complex. For that matter, employment exists maybe 5000 years, human race is at the very least 165000 years old. I have visited places where it doesn&#x27;t seem to hold (villages in Africa, slums, where it seems people are more than content with just most physiological needs and some form of drug. Oh and they&#x27;ll do a lot for different drugs, ie. for alcohol).<p>Of course the first part of Maslow&#x27;s theory is true, by definition, people will fight, kill and die for physiological needs. Not having them, after all, means dying yourself. The other levels, including respect and &quot;good&quot; food, I don&#x27;t think work like that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#x27;s_hierarchy_of_needs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#x27;s_hierarchy_of_needs</a>",1370855918

Ultimately the user is far more likely to give up their privacy by posting identifiable information online, and through graph analysis revealing their associates too.<p>What I can do though is: Leave the core data in Europe, not store anything that I do not need to offer the service (and I don&#x27;t need your real identity), educate users and encourage the use of Tor and VPNs, implement what measures I can do protect users (SSL).",1370855077

It wouldn&#x27;t be the first time a judge overrules classified information, right?<p>It seems to me the judges are accomplices to the government (why would they still grant the warrants, if they already found it unconstitutional?), and even if there was some kind of conflict in the law, I assume they would know this could go to the Supreme Court and it would be solved there.",1370854897

People suddenly care about privacy?<p>Now, I don&#x27;t have my finger on the pulse of the everyman... not by a longshot.   But within my own echo chamber?  all those things were pretty big deals.   As you said, nobody else cared, yeah.  But they were a big deal to the news I read.<p>My question to you, is &quot;Does anyone care about this?&quot;  I mean, I know I care, and I know my own echo chamber is all shook up, but if my &quot;media bubble&quot; mattered?  we&#x27;d have been on IPv6 a decade ago.<p>So yeah.   what does Fox news have to say about this?    Hm.  Looking, it&#x27;s got something about how Ron Paul is worked up, but the other bits there seem to be about how much jailtime the whistleblower is getting.     There&#x27;s a neutral to positive article about what the NSA does.<p>Go to npr.org, for the mainstream left, and there&#x27;s an opinion piece calling Obama &quot;big brother&quot;  -  so I guess that&#x27;s something?<p>We&#x27;ll see how long the stories last.  But yeah...  I think you are mistaking your own media bubble for the world as a whole.  My guess?  The average Facebook user is going to shrug and keep using facebook.<p>Hell, this is going to be a big deal for me (as most of my customers also live in the same media bubble or echo chamber or whatever you want to call it as I do.)  -  I don&#x27;t have any real response, either.   (I&#x27;ve been talking about setting up customer portals where you can see all log data I have about you... but that&#x27;s hard to do well enough that I can honestly say &quot;This is <i>ALL</i> the data I have about you,&quot; and it&#x27;s not like I don&#x27;t have a whole bunch of other work to do, and really?  as a VPS provider, well, most of what I log is access to your serial console and the like.  Really, everything the NSA would want would be within your VPS.  Well, that and the ip -> billing data mapping, but I think you know I&#x27;m keeping that.)",1370854836

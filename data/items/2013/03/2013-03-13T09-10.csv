After all these years he deserves to make a lot of money money and not have to worry about money anymore. Those that criticize him for ""selling out"" will probably sell their start-up to just about anyone for FU money.<p>What I find not true, especially in the past year or two is this:<p><i>""My impression of Google's leadership, employees, and choice of projects often leads me to believe that they sell ads so they can continue making really cool stuff - not that they try to come up with cool stuff so that they can sell ads.""</i><p>Part of my job requires me to surf without ad-blockers and with Chrome. There's no trick in the book they do not use to make you click on ads or sign for their services. Even Chrome, the ""open source"" the supposed savior of the web now has ads.

I don't think it's fair to characterise this as just bait - there has to be a reward for both parties in an offer like this. I think this is of interest to the HN crowd, and as long as they don't keep spamming HN with it, it's useful info. So not flagged.<p>The service looks great - control panel looks good and covers much of the same stuff as linode, setup is a breeze. I think the design of the panel is nice and clear. One thing I would recommend is that you guide customers not to leave root login open, and perhaps request a key during setup instead (at least as an option), as leaving ssh open on port 22 and accessible by root by default is going to leave a lot of your servers more vulnerable than they should be, particularly if people change the root password to something silly.<p>Do you offer DNS? That'd be a nice addition if not, haven't looked around fully so might have missed it.<p>I'll be testing this out in a small way for personal projects, but it looks comparable to something like Linode <i>IF</i> you can match their uptime and service, which is a really hard thing to do. Obviously I wouldn't trust it for anything important until I and many others have tested it for quite some time and found any issues, so you might find it difficult to collect serious customers at first, but I think this offer is a great way to entice people to try it out.<p>I like that backups have a very low price per hour - 0,000056<p>A few tiny localisation hints:<p>Customers in the english speaking world will find commas as separators on prices confusing.<p>There is no verb 'backuping' that should be backing up - I'm trying one now!",1363168445

While everyone in my surroundings were using pascal and basic that days, inlining asm only for occasional IO work, I used to scaffold tremendous routines and structures in a matter of days, using base asm and macro. While my friends, looking at my sources, were only able to say ""what the ...ck is this, that is insanly sick, how do you understand all this?"", asm was so natural and fluent to me.<p>Then dark times of C and C++, Java, C# etc. followed (BTW, I hate purified OOP deep inside, it always seemed to me so unhuman), and several years ago my roads crossed with LUA, and I instantly loved it. Pity, I had no chances to use it much, but I remember that feeling, when code and data magically interlace and create beautiful structures.<p>Now I am looking at Clojure and recalling my Asm youth, and these awesome days with LUA.

It should also be clear from the documentation that comes with the pills.<p>Second, you should only change your medication after consulting with your doctor. In this case it looks like the course was ""I took the meds for six months, and then I felt better so I stopped"", which is not recommended. The relapse rate is significantly lowered if you take the meds until you have no symptoms + 6 months (or longer, if it isn't your first depression).<p>Third, it really is very recommended to slowly taper of the medication and not go cold turkey.

I've always thought that the use of an asterisk to denote multiplication was some sort of compromise owing to the lack of a """" key on a typical computer keyboard. But it seems that there are much older precedents for it.<p>Meanwhile, using a slash to denote division is explained in the Fractions page.<p>> <i>The diagonal fraction bar (also called a solidus or virgule) was introduced because the horizontal fraction bar was difficult typographically, requiring three terraces of type. An early handwritten document with forward slashes in lieu of fraction bars is Thomas Twining's Ledger of 1718 ...</i>",1363166961

Whereas with a plane, your middle-class American gets in one 2-3 times a year and is willing to suck it up.<p>In order to be comparable to cars, you not only have to hypothesize an order of magnitude shift in cost to match cars, but <i>also</i> an order of magnitude shift in <i>demand</i> to match cars.  While I fully admit that there is that sort of demand in limited markets (for example, commuting programmers to the valley), these markets are not on the same chart as car demand.  I do not really see what could possibly motivate ordinary people to travel 600 miles twice per day.<p>Meanwhile, as you've been trying to leapfrog the car market, it has not remained stagnant.  If you are a knowledge worker, a self-driving car is an effective substitute for flight, since the impact of additional passive travel time is negligible.  (Even non-knowledge workers need sleep, so it will be of benefit to them too.)  At the distances I generally travel (regional US), an uninterrupted block of 8 hours in a vehicle is actually preferable to a 2-hour block flying, so I would actually pay <i>less</i> to travel by plane.",1363166377

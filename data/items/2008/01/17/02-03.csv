Two options are particularly relevant to backups:\n--link-same makes identical file data into hardlinks, reducing space consumption both within the archive, and on disk when extracted.\n--coalesce-heap when files with identical data are encountered, the data is only stored once in the archive, reducing the size of the archive.",1200538083

There's no way for me to kill off some users/threads so I don't see them again. I think my query mechanisms were pretty elegant and lightweight. hystry permitted filtering <i>conversations</i> (rather than comments) involving specific people, and also easily blacklisting going-nowhere threads.<p><a href=""http://blog.hystry.com/post/20252078"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.hystry.com/post/20252078</a>\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=83702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=83702</a>",1200536977
99601,comment,99372,99586,0,0,hhm,,,"pg, I think the current implementation has a problem. Most of the time, ""on:"" links go to NYC comment pages, but when the comments were done replying to the posted article (and not to other comments), ""on:"" links go directly to the posted article / website. I think all links should go to the comment pages always, to keep the ""on:"" behavior coherent.<p>Thanks a lot for implementing this feature, that was fast!<p>Edit: this happens only on the ""threads"" page I think.",1200536586

I love what weblogs inc has done with their recent image gallery revamp: http://www.autoblog.com/photos/detroit-2008-desktop-wallpaper-gallery/586793/<p>Particularly I'm looking for something that can auto-watermark - probably imagemagick-based. For clarification this would be hosted on my server and fully integrated within my setup.<p>would love any feedback",1200536278

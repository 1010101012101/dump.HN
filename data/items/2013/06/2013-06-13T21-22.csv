For example, the US system is definitely more &quot;democratic&quot; than the Iranian system, although they both involve voting. Conversely, the Swiss system is arguably more democratic than either the US or Iran.<p>However, it is worth noting that attempting to rank systems by quantity-of-democracy-nature stops being useful pretty quickly, and it becomes helpful to introduce other terms/variables/factors/axes along which to measure and evaluate political systems.<p>Equally, once certain baselines are met, the exact mechanics of the system quickly stop being as important as less tangible factors such as civil society mechanisms and cultural biases:- Particularly the professional culture of the legislature:- Ability of legislators to set aside party politics to work in the national interest; To preserve the integrity of the political system from corruption, and maintain the ability to make decisions without bias in the face of attempts to lobby and influence behaviour.",1371160631

They don&#x27;t listen, they don&#x27;t know what customers want, they don&#x27;t care, and they won&#x27;t budge.<p>I predict Facebook will see a similar demise. The <i>nature</i> of social networks is that they are transient. Are newsgroups dead? Forums? No. They&#x27;ve been going strong since the inception of the internet, because they cultivate a strong culture -- something every community needs to survive. Social networks don&#x27;t do that. They&#x27;re a pile of random, somewhat primitive thoughts that don&#x27;t engage and have no net culture. Discussion is very pared-back and smalltalk-like at best.<p>In some ways, it seems that we&#x27;re going back to the early 2000s. Proprietary IM protocols like Skype and iMessage are being adopted at a greater scale, and social networks are slowly fading out. We can return to an age where inter-personal communication becomes the main method of communication, and social networks will be but an ancient relic of a primordial past.<p>I know, I know -- this is a tangent, but it&#x27;s relevant.",1371160566

One of your base classes is Widget. It is almost certainly worthless to show every class that derives from Widget on one page, even if you could. What you are really interested in is how subsystem interact when in various states. For example, you might have a map window that uses a small collection of items derived from Widget, some strategy pattern type things (to project to Mercator or whatever), and so on. The only useful graphic is a sheet that shows how all of these components interact. But, maps are complex, so you are probably pulling in and using 100+ classes. Most of which are not relevant. So it takes a human, and a lot of thought, to figure out how to slice through the code to produce a useful UML diagram for the area of interest.<p>And then the diagrams are static. You have a bunch of other stacks of paper to try to show how things happen in time. Typically there are several scenerios - each scenerio is going to involve a different subset of classes.<p>Its combinatorial explosion. No one can do this. Its far more work than writing and debugging the code itself. The code IS the documentation, for better and worse (and yes, sometimes it&#x27;s worse).<p>So, like most people, I do whiteboard sketches of high level design. If I am particularly pressed, I&#x27;ll sit down with pen and paper, sketch 2-4 competing UML diagrams, then hand write in different transactions/events - showing how data flows, and so on.<p>But capturing an entire source tree? Impossible, unless you just want the spaghetti diagrams that are not displayable on any monitor, and that are completely useless at telling a story.",1371160227

AOL has a database 21 million members deep, each with their own specific ID number. The way that AOLSearch is set up, however, allows for AOL to keep records of all the websites visited by any given member. Even though the true identity of the user isnt known, a full profile of a member can be made just by using the information stored by AOLSearch. By keeping records of what people query through AOLSearch, the company is able to learn a great deal about them without knowing their names.</i><p>Source: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_privacy</a>",1371159638

I just think there are better ways of doing that than how X works, and X only lets you change the window manager, but not anything else.<p>The thing is that X&#x27;s configurability sucks (.XDefaults files, and the various ad-hoc syntaxes of the various window manager configuration files, which may or may not run m4 over them so you have yet another crazy macro syntax layer).<p>Since the user interface toolkit and window manager in NeWS was defined as PostScript classes loaded into the window server and shared by all applications, you could subclass or patch or redefine them (usually when NeWS was starting up), and as long as they still supported the same APIs (which is a big limiting factor on what you could do of course -- pie menus emulated the linear menu api, but a linear menu api is not necessarily the best api for pie menus), then ALL applications would pick up the changes.<p>Of course there were some things you could change on the fly (like the default menu class, except that if apps cached instances of menus instead of recreating them, they would not change), but you could not redefine the window frames on the fly since they already were created, and reparenting the clients into new frames wasn&#x27;t trivial.<p>There was a function to change the default menu class used by the window manager, and it knew how to create new menus with the new classes based on the old menus, for the root menu, and also the window frame menus. But any applications that created menus would have to be in on that game. It would certainly be possible to make a MenuClassChanged event to tell them to recreate all their menus, but nobody ever bothered to do that, since it wasn&#x27;t something that people needed very often, and would require a lot of work for application developers.<p>You have to weigh how much the flexibility costs in terms of complexity and efficiency against how much people really need the flexibility, and at what time they need it (immediately at any time, app startup time, server startup time).<p>X pays a very heavy price in terms of complexity to be able to support changing the window manager on the fly (or rather, plugging in different window managers, without providing a turing complete extension language in the server). And it&#x27;s not because they necessarily badly wanted you to be able to change window managers at any time you felt like it without restarting the server (which was nice, but not something users were clamoring for), but it was because they just didn&#x27;t want to dictate any &quot;policy&quot; about how window managers should work.<p>And why just the window manager, and not switch the entire user interface toolkit -- you still want to do that don&#x27;t you? I&#x27;d rather have an architecture where all applications share the same user interface toolkit that runs in one address space local to the server, and have a consistent and customizable user interface, which is how NeWS worked. That&#x27;s much more important to me than being able to change the user interface on the fly, in my opinion. And it has other nice side-effects like it does not suffer from network race conditions or even context switching overhead, and all the ui code lives in one place and is not duplicated, which mattered a lot in the days before SunOS supported shared libraries -- Sun actually linked all the common SunView apps together into one gigantic monolithic app that would behave like a different app depending on the name it was invoked with on the command line, so the SunView user interface libraries were shared in memory and started up faster, by virtue of the fact that all the standard SunView apps WERE the same app (SunOS did at least support multiple instances of the same app sharing read-only code).",1371158669

5876561,comment,5876066,5876066,9,0,aggronn,,,"In school, UML seemed like a great idea. It wasn&#x27;t very fun, but it was useful, and if you had a simple class project, UMLs certainly made things simpler if you were even okay at them.<p>When I got my first job, however, there were no UML diagrams. I was saddened to see this. I don&#x27;t remember if I was surprised, but I was so sure that I would been useful to have a detailed UMI diagram available for studying the codebase.<p>So, as I got acclimated to the codebase, I took it upon myself to start putting together a UML for our existing product, so that training new people would be easier. After spending several days doing this, my opinion or UML changed dramatically for a couple of reasons:<p>1) Pretty much all of the UML tools out there are not a pleasure to use. Drawing UML diagrams was still infinitely better than using the various programs I tried. But drawing them on anything but a whiteboard wasn&#x27;t scalable to the size of the project.<p>2) Once I had the basic classes drawn out, and realized how diverse the kinds of classes we had were, it became apparent that this just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. A basic flowchart of the application would be equally valuable. The specificity of UML wasn&#x27;t worthwhile, having a class with 10+ subclasses was a mess.<p>3) What I did have was hard to see. This goes back to the first point--the tools are not good. When you labored over all the clicking and dragging, you pulled together this monster of a graph that you can only see a small portion of at a time in a given screen. It was easy to get lost. Printing wasn&#x27;t useful.<p>Ultimately, I only ended up using UMLs when we were thinking about how we were going to build out new features, or redesign stuff. It was a .NET shop building a Silverlight app, so serialization and strict static typing was critical. A decent JSON api would have made life easy, but since the back end and the front end were essentially all the same thing, class diagrams were very useful. So for the 2 or 3 times that we had to develop or redo class serialization while I was there, it came in handy only for working on small 2-5 class models.<p>That brings us to the next point: do class diagrams have a place in an increasingly dynamically typed world? Functional programming in javascript. Frameworks that have their own detailed class system, or which aren&#x27;t even class oriented.<p>UML has essentially become analogous to cursive. You learn about it early on, and its important to have a notion of how to read it. But ultimately, since we don&#x27;t use it every day, we basically never use it.",1371157353

This is why a relative noob like Snowden was working on it -- it was web work. It&#x27;s also why he had such a broad overview of what was going on. He knew the direction and capabilities, if not the details. He was probably just hooking up APIs somewhere.<p>That&#x27;s just guesswork, of course.

Someone connecting to a ""open"" MySQL server will only be able to run those type of queries (select,update or delete) that he is explicitly permitted to run and only on those database and tables where the admin has granted him access.<p>Not too different from a web service.<p>Also no amount of encryption will secure the system because it's not about man in the middle attack. It's about decompiling the binary. The attacker has full access to all your encryption functions, routines and everything you put there. See it as like he has all your client side source code.<p>The only benefit I see in using a web service is restricting one user from accessing other users data in the same table. It's about only 20% improvement in security as I see it. And that's only because MySQL doesn't support row level authorization.<p>Other issues that are not any more secure through a web service:<p>1. Crash the MySQL server by running rouge queries. On the other side an attacker can DOS a web service too.<p>2. One can run Insert/Update/Delete queries on MySQL. Well web services has to run insert/update/delete queries too based on user input --- where the attacker modifies the source code that generates the input.<p>3. One can validate input using web service. One can validate input using MySQL trigger/SP too.<p>Just trying to show that I don't see much improvement in security using a web service when the attacker is controlling your client side source code.

Note that the center frequencies are 25MHz apart.  In DSSS (1 or 2Mbps) or CCK (5.5 or 11Mbps) your radio has a signal bandwidth (or frequency occupation) of 22 MHz.  Using OFDM modulation, the signal bandwidth is 20MHz.<p>Radios do not have an exact edge to their channel, and energy spreads beyond the edges of the channel boundaries. However, the overall energy level drops as the signal spreads farther from the center of the channel. The 802.11b standard defines the required limits for the energy outside the channel boundaries (+/- 11 MHz), also known as the spectral mask.<p>At 11 MHz from the center of the channel, the energy must be 30 dB lower than the maximum signal level, and at 22 MHz away, the energy must be 50 dB below the maximum level. As you move farther from the center of the channel, the energy continues to decrease but is still present, providing some interference on several more channels.<p>Ch12 is centered at 2467MHz.   11MHz up is 2478MHz.  The US ISM band ends at 2485Mhz.  In theory you don't need to be a HAM running under part 97 to transmit here, BUT remember that you're probably transmitting at 100mW (20dBm), so your radio's design is probably transmitting 50dBm into the edge of the band.<p>MOREOVER, the HAM band in-question is 2390-2450 MHz, so you're operating illegally when you're transmitting WiFi on ch12 (centered at 2467MHz!)",1324718022

Video games are art, or much or what is commonly considered art isn't. Gesamtkunstwerk is a word/concept that describes a whole artwork made up of other pieces of art. It isn't a new concept. It's been around for nearly two centuries. Take a look at theater for instance. No one doubts that it's art, but it is made up of costume design, acting, the score, etc. This whole debate like everything else will finally end when all the older people who don't believe video games are art grow old and die.",1271915945

1284280,comment,1280854,1281553,0,0,apotheon,,,"Hacker culture not only <i>is</i> alive and well -- it <i>was</i> alive and well through those years, too.  It was just less visible, and since Stallman was moving through different circles, it wouldn't have felt as much to him like it was all clustered around his immediate vicinity.<p>It is to some extent in human nature to assume that what's happening around someone is what's happening everywhere -- but that's really no excuse for declaring himself the last of his breed as he did.  In fact, I'd say that the rise of the cypherpunks was a stronger resurgence in the hacker culture tide than Stallman's generation, and actually far more committed to freedom in an essential sense.<p>The fact things change doesn't mean the good stuff has all died off.  I think we're a lot better off for the modern state of hacker culture than if there was still the kind of hacker culture that existed Way Back When.  Concepts of freedom, inquiry, and improvement that are central to a hacker culture have become more refined and encompassing than they were in those early days, which is pretty much what happens with everything that sees long-term success; it starts out less well-defined, and feeling more ""special"" because of its rarefied nature, then grows more widespread, better defined, and more generally applicable, thanks to the efforts of people who pick up where a previous generation left off to add their own efforts to the continuing evolution of the movement.<p>Far from being the last of his breed, he went from being an early visionary to a late relic, from what I can see.  I might not have used such harsh terms for it, but his own statements about being the last of his kind pretty much completes the picture of Stallman as a dinosaur who has died and is too stubbornly attached to his own illusions to realize it.<p>Yeah, the culture isn't materially different.  It has simply continued developing.  If it had remained exactly the same as it was for Stallman's early peers, that wouldn't have been success.  It would have been stagnation.<p>He should learn to take a cue from people like Ken Thompson, who has managed to remain relevant and continue to contribute fresh new ideas to the state of general purpose operating system design all these years.  Yes, advocates for freedom in our software development model are of critical importance; I'm not arguing otherwise.  I think, though, that Stallman's apparent idea that such advocacy should focus on trying to recapture a communal sharing model that worked for a very small number of people who mostly knew each other, at least peripherally, is naive at best.  Furthermore, the way Thompson and his spiritual descendants lead by example does almost as much for effective advocacy as the actual advocates (e.g., Bruce Perens and Theo de Raadt, to name a couple out of many -- who are, unlike Stallman, well-known for being currently contributing developers as well as advocates, thus lending credence to their statements even when they're abrasive in the extreme as de Raadt can sometimes be).<p>Looking at things with a critical eye, Stallman is the only guy I can think of who is granted so much relevance as both a developer and an advocate for freedom in software use and development whose achievements are always described in the past tense.",1271915083

No. Are they art like you might find at a modern art museum? Sometimes, but very rarely. Almost never, for the sort of game you can buy for a console from the store. Are they art like industrial design, transportation, bridges, etc? Probably not, since the games themselves are usually only software. Is software art? Sometimes, probably. Then are games art like software is art? Could be, but most people think of the game as the entire package itself, not just the code that powers the engine.<p>Are the in-game assets art? The characters, scenery, etc? Individually, certainly. As a whole? Debatable. Individually, the assets have no purpose other than their form. Collectively, they take the form as fulfilling part of an exchange the consumer (who paid money with the understanding that he or she will receive a minimum amount of stimulation and entertainment) has made with the producer of the game. Few people expect to pay $60, put a disc into their console, and look at pictures of chairs nailed to a wall and read a marker-felted diatribe about the uselessness of progressing fashionable design standards if the functional form does not change over time. If you pay $60 to go through a museum of modern art and don't like it, well, too fucking bad.<p>Most commercially produced games, just like with most commercially produced movies, the consumer pays money with the expectation that their purchase will be fulfilled.<p>So by that definition, most Hollywood movies are not art, either.

Small devices are also generally more tightly integrated than laptops/desktops so owning the stack may be advantageous.",1271912754

How does electricity shape the weather?<p>Thunderstorms are a highly complex system and I'm not an expert, so I can only speculate: A storm builds up a high electric potential between the clouds and the ground which results in a lightning strike if it gets strong enough.\nNow, what does the existence of grounded power-grids change? It basically makes the ground more conducting which may result in a more evenly distributed ground-charge. As this doesn't change the potential between ground and higher air masses, I don't think it directly influences a storm.<p>Maybe the weather is influenced by horizontal potential (Air from point A is attracted to differently charged air at point B), but I don't think this effect would be strong enough to notice.<p>While reading through the article, another idea sprang to my mind: Why don't we use all this electricity? Harnessing power from lighning seems rather impractical (extreme amounts of electcity in one unpredictable instant), but how about building a high tower or just laying a few long, ungrounded cabels an then slowly dischargin a thunderstorm?",1338684853

There's a cavity in the body and we're actually making a small change to the design of how the electronics are integrated into the dock itself instead of the underlying assembly so that if the 30 pin changes we can adapt to it.  Another benefit is that through a generic expansion port we could also support other phones / devices.<p>The ability to dock the phone into the body was a really awesome experience, which is why we did it even with the risk of making people concerned with the form factor dependency.  However, the gTar has a USB port so you can hook it up to any device that supports USB hosting.  This is possible with most iOS devices with the aid of a camera adapter kit.  We might eventually be able to produce such a special cable allowing you to hook it up directly to an iOS device.<p>The gTar tech was not originally intended to be for iPhone, that was a bit of an unintentional pivot we made when we met with a particular iOS app company we had a lot of respect for and wanted to impress them.

Doing it intentionally is a bit like not buckling up because you have 100% faith in your air bags.<p>For the non electrical people: GFCI works by measuring the current in vs the current out.  Normally these should be perfectly equal.  But if you drop your hairdryer in the bathtub, maybe 10 amps comes in (through the plug), 9.9 amps goes out (through the plug) and 0.1 amps goes out (through the bathtub, killing you).  GFCI notices that 10 != 9.9 and shuts down.

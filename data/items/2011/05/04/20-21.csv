2515281,comment,2515010,2515220,2,0,jerf,,,"While I agree that central management will never be able to effectively create this itself on a large scale, there are things that the government will have to do to get us to where we need to be... not least of which is to let up on the centralized control. This building of a new system can't be in more than fits and starts with limited benefits to the society it is embedded in if the primary government still mandates (or nearly so) the use of the old system on a grand scale. There will be some set of jurisdictions that do, and some that don't.",1304542752

2515276,comment,2515010,2515118,10,0,gatlin,,,"We are already working on that in the education community - project based learning. It has its detractors but the fundamental tenets are: 1) learning is the product of the work of learners, 2) students learn by doing. Science classrooms taught this way typically produce students who go on to be very successful academically and professionally in the maths and sciences. The secret? Integrate multiple disciplines, let students explore facets of the subject which appeal to them, and have them work on something - with each other (!!) - which has a tangible result or artifact. We have cracked it, and we have peer-reviewed papers to prove it. Now we just have to get the troglodytes in charge of public education to adopt it.<p>[Edit]<p>Some citations:<p>Rivet, Krajcik:""Achieving Standards in Urban Systemic Reform: An Example of a Sixth Grade Project-Based Science Curriculum""<p>Hmelo-Silver et al.

Also TCP cannot do multicast. Youtube uses TCP (AFAIK) but you tube is usually not live.<p>UDP does not waste time retransmitting packets but UDP does not guarantee all packets will arrive. Thus, with UDP you may have dropped packets. In the old times you would just use UDP and accept that there will be occasional quality degradations due to dropped packets, but in the old times streaming video and audio over the internet was really bad.<p>Nowadays the expectations are so high and the video codecs are so complex, few dropped packets could cause noticeable artifacts.<p>Anyways, sorry for going off on a tangent.

(To clarify: hoisting seems to me to be <i>more</i> or <i>worse</i> than just ""there's no block scoping."") Just now on my the subway ride home I came across this example from David Flanagan's <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i>:<p><pre><code>    var scope = ""global"";\n    function f() {\n        console.log(scope); // Prints ""undefined"", not ""global""\n        var scope = ""local""; // Variable initialized here, but defined everywhere\n        console.log(scope); // Prints ""local""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI'm someone who uses Javascript only occasionally, and I'm trying to learn it better. But I thought I understood scope just fine: no block scope, function scope, lexical scoping within functions and nested functions. I may have read about ""hoisting"" before, but honestly it never sunk in until today.<p>So I'm assuming that Coffeescript always compiles down to Javascript where variables are explicitly hoisted upwards in declaration?

Some other factors:<p>- The main monetization method I am thinking of doesn't depend on the users being on the base site.<p>- The timeframe to make the offer is short.  The longer I wait, the more likely this competitor site will rally its own developers in order to copy my product.<p>- Making a specialized embed version will require some time to adapt to the new site, stealing away some development time for the main site.<p>- I am on version 1.0.  The embed will give identical capability for the competitor site.  Though this is only until I release more advanced features for the base site.<p>- There is no user registration involved.<p>I very much appreciate any consideration.

2515085,comment,2514690,2514690,44,0,HedgeMage,,,"I don't think it's about money as much as lifestyle -- the OP misses this entirely by assuming that both entrepreneurs are single and without children.<p>Something interesting I observed at Startup Weekend here in Indy last fall:<p>When it came time to form teams, all the young'uns grouped with one another, and the four of us codgers with responsibilities worked together.  The line wasn't drawn according to age: there was one 30+ guy in another group, but he was single; two of the four members of my group were still in our 20's, but we were the primary sources of income for families with children, and I think that led us to fit in better with our 40+ cofounders.<p>With a few exceptions, I'd find it uncomfortable -- if not unworkable -- cofounding with the bouncy 20-something who has no outside responsibilities.  When team building means getting drunk together on a Wednesday night, work hours are noon-8pm, and the company culture is low on planning and high on ""nothing to lose"", a company is just not going to be a good fit for me.<p>I'm fine with economic sacrifice, and with working hard.  Because I'm looking for a new startup to join, I've tooled down my living expenses such that I could do an extended period somewhere between the two guys in that article.  Because I've always been a hard worker, I've made my work schedule part of my family's life:  I work a normal 9-3:30 in the office (currently home office, but I'm flexible), then after school, my son brings his homework to my office and we do our work together for a couple of hours.  I tend to get in another hour or two in the evenings after he goes to sleep.  I never get drunk, let alone on a weeknight when I have to get a first grader up for school in the morning.  I'll never end up in an incubator because I'm not changing my son's school, leaving his speech therapy program, leaving our dojo, and generally up-ending his whole world in exchange for a few months of help for my startup.<p>I often meet people at my stage in life (kids, responsibilities, etc.) who say they don't do start-ups because they perceive ""bouncy without responsibilities"" to be the expectation of all startups.  Their loss.  I have to look a little harder, but I find other ""codgers"" out there in the entrepreneur community.  I have to wonder if the people held back by the stereotype really have whatever that spark is that makes us take risks on new things anyway.<p>Oh, and I almost forgot.... GET OFF MY LAWN!",1304539549

2515080,comment,2514363,2514680,3,0,tspiteri,,,"The properties you mention are mainly ""low level"" properties, which in the end affect the ""high level"" properties that are speed and power consumption. For example capacitance limits clock speed and also has an effect on power consumption, and leakage current reduces power efficiency. Capacitance and leakage current themselves depend on size. I think that the physical properties you mention (and maybe others) may be used to create a model, which can then be used to estimate clock speed and power consumption at different operating points.",1304539474

He's looking for a young, inexperienced person who doesn't know his rights and of whom he can take advantage.<p>Where there is some truth in this is that a 30-year-old first-time entrepreneur usually cannot get terms from a VC that would merit leaving a more stable job. A person of that age with a decent career is unlikely to have much interest in the terms (participating preferred, easy to fire the founders, giving up a lot of board seats, low salary) available to a no-name first-time entrepreneur. If someone who is 35 is willing to take a 3x-liquidation preference and participating preferred, do you really want to fund him? Obviously no, because he either lacks decent options or doesn't understand business, neither of which is a good sign for someone of that age. On the other hand, there are plenty of 22-year-olds with a lot of talent but no sense of what they're worth or what rights they have.",1304539256

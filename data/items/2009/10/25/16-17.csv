Almost no programmers, however, are compensated at 10x the compensation of the average or lowest performing member of their organization.</i><p>That's not an article of faith.  It is a repeatedly measured fact.  Pick up a copy of <i>Peopleware</i> for an explanation of how that was measured.<p>That said, in comparisons of programmers from different organizations the single biggest factor in determining performance was the productivity of other programmers at your organization.  Part of that is that productivity is highly environment driven.  Part is that good programmers like to congregate together.  Either way you are very unlikely to see 10 to 1 ratios within an organization.  A ratio of 3 or 4 to 1 is much more realistic.  (See <i>Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art</i> by Steve McConnell for a cite.)<p>Going back to the theme of the article, there is another reason for high salaries, which is to provide a disincentive for bribery.  You see this in an obvious way with traders.  Imagine that you're bargaining over the exact price of a $10 million bond.  Wouldn't you be tempted to offer $10,000 under the table to the other guy if he'll agree that the bond is worth $100,000 more?  If the other guy was receiving a normal salary, wouldn't this offer be hard to resist?<p>However are you going to risk the outrageous salaries that traders get offered for a small bribe like that?

Wilson would enthusiastically agree with you that there aren't very good metrics out there not only for programmer productivity, but a number of other things that you'd want to measure in software. At the beginning of the talk he contrasted the software sciences against other, older disciplines just to show how incredibly nascent it is.<p>His most damning point of the current state of affairs was that there is a lot of metrics/methodology pseudoscience being spouted by people and businesses in our profession, and that we often eat it up unchallenged. His optimistic counter-point was that things are turning around and measurement, experimentation and skepticism are spreading, and as you point out, for some companies like Google, it's yielding a lot of gains, even if they haven't cracked any universal code of productivity (does anyone actually believe we ever will? This will always be a moving target).<p>The most frequent phrase used by Wilson in his talk was ""wouldn't that be a useful thing to know?""

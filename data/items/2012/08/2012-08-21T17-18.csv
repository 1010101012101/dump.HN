At the time, there was supposedly something on the legal side of things which they were afraid to run afoul with by releasing free iPod Touch updates.<p>I suppose, if they were to release new versions of OS X for free, they may risk being sued for trying to push competitors out of the market by giving away a product that others are trying to sell.<p>No, it doesn't seem right to me, but sometimes laws are outdated or simply abused.",1345571996
4413862,comment,4411491,4413013,2,0,technito,,,"I'm learning a lot from this exchange. I think your statement is a combination of truth as well as simply misreading what I was trying to say.<p>Sometimes, I have a tendency to create my own dialect in which only I understand the context (self note: stop doing that). I am of course open to suggestion and you are spot on-- it does sound like i'm trying to sound smart (<i>cringe</i>) Def going to re-word that to express myself in a more straightforward manner.<p>This isn't a blog to enviously rebel against those that have worked and deserve the position they are in, but rather a blog to alleviate the organic ramifications that are out of their control. This isn't a blog to cover startups or ideas that aren't getting covered-- theres likely a reason why they aren't. I am not hating on people that write about technology-- this is their job and many are very good at it. But, the reality is they are working for a company that desires to increase their bottom line just like any other business-- as they should. My point is because of this, the ecosystem is click driven. Which means a much greater frequency of startups will be covered. Which means even if a startup is doing nothing new and the technology is rather unimpressive, the brand attached to it means clicks ($$) so it gets coverage.<p>When this is done at such a frequency, the greater the likelihood the companies that are doing dynamic things fall through the cracks-- creating a lower standard that isn't producing optimal results of what the space is capable of.<p>Many of the startups I cover probably will be startups i've read about else where and never even submitted anything. So, in essence this is just a filter to differentiate from startups written for clicks due to brand equity and startups that are doing dynamic things-- built upon a culture that emphatically acknowledges this standpoint. That doesn't mean A16Z startups won't get covered. That doesn't mean Y Combinator companies won't get covered. This does mean not all their portfolio startups are doing dynamic things that legitimately deserve acknowledgement.<p>And the only way to fully keep intact the integrity of this blog without question is to not monetize. This is a hobby for me. Startups are my passion and I like to write. I love giving product deep thought-- where are they headed with this and what can this ultimately become and what sort of impact can potentially proceed and how this will affect the ecosystem? I want to read about startups that force my mind to think about these things, kind of like your response has forced me to think deeper about this blog. And then cover them from this perspective with the intent to set a higher standard for everyone to aspire to.<p>That's really all i'm trying to do-- and maybe your standpoint of cynicism is a result of me not initially expressing myself properly (aka the first paragraph).",1345571995

It's one thing to plug some data into a random forest and go ""oh cool, I guess that did okay"" and entirely another to see how other competitors are comparing.<p>one of the biggest challenges I've found in implementing ML projects is I don't have a great sense of when I've really gotten the most info out of the data.  I'm not particularly competitive but the contest format is great for this.  When you see that a solution you'd normally be happy with ranks in the lower half of the answer you're really pushed to improve your solution.<p>This is leads you to learn your tools and algorithms better. For a couple of contests I took seriously I ended up learning tons about R, spent most of my nights reading academic papers on various newer techniques, and also read through a few books. On top of all that you really should spend time reading up on how past winner have won which gives a bunch of practical insight into approaching different ML problems.<p>In one contest I tried the hardest in I actually placed terribly after the final results were calculated, but looking over what went wrong I was amazed to see that I actually did progress really far with my understanding of ml. I'd say a month of seriously competing is easily worth a semester long grad class.",1345571900

Everybody's business is different, so anybody can track any events they want, internal or external (internal like infrastructure changes, version roll-outs etc., and external such as oil price, major news events etc.)<p>Also, data layers can be public, so for example I prepared a simple Google Panda Updates events layer, that you can overlay and see how your website traffic was affected. Another example is the US Holidays layer.<p>Currently it's available as a Chrome extension, and overlays charts on Google Analytics and Quantcast.

4413775,comment,4413277,4413552,2,0,jonnathanson,,,"The problem isn't so much that marketers don't have concrete and measurable KPIs. They do. But at many companies, marketers affect those KPIs only indirectly. For instance, if you work in marketing for a B2B sales-driven company, it's very hard for the marketers to quantify their performance (whereas it's fairly easy for the salespeople to do so, even if some credit deserves to be shared). Similarly, if you're working in marketing for a retailer, the buyers or operations people will be able to measure sales, profit margins, operational efficiency, etc. Marketing may have a huge impact on several of those metrics, but the marketer doesn't have his or her hand on the lever as directly as the buyer does. Etc.<p>The problem with the discipline of marketing is that it's often a complementary discipline. It's sort of like the Steve Nash or Magic Johnson of company operations: if it's performing well, it's enhancing the performance of everyone else on the team.<p>In certain industries, by contrast, marketing rules the roost. The consumer packaged goods (CPG) business, for instance, is directed by marketing. A marketer at a CPG firm, known commonly as a Brand Manager, is exactly that: he or she is running almost every aspect of a major brand. Accordingly, the performance of brand managers is (relatively) easy to measure. You've got sales, margins, market share, etc., and all of them tie fairly directly to your business decisions. Brand management is akin to general management, and many brand managers would argue that what they do is full-spectrum marketing; everyone in marketing in other industries is just performing a subset of what the brand manager does.",1345571076

JSON is gaining widespread adoption for data serialization applications since it's the correct tool.  XML isn't.<p>In a markup language there is an underlying text that you're annotating with machine readable tags.  Most data interchange doesn't have an underlying text -- you can't strip away the tags and expect it to be understandable.  If you're writing a web page, that has to be read by humans and interpreted by machines... you need a markup language.<p>By contrast, data interchange is about moving arbitrary data structures between processes and/or languages.

4413700,comment,4413277,4413277,0,0,mindcrime,,,"Good stuff.  I guess, as hackers go, I was always a little weird, in that I always found marketing fascinating.  But over the past year or so (and especially the past 6  months) I've been diving into marketing <i>big time</i>, studying as much marketing (and, to a lesser extent, sales) material as I can, and starting to do things like putting together a tentative marketing plan for our startup.<p>Wow.  The OP is right, this stuff is NOT easy.  Here's one for you... a guy named Chet Holmes, who is a fairly well known marketing guru (and who unfortunately passed away recently, R.I.P.) spoke a lot about ""core stories"" and how ""market data trumps product data,"" and suggests that the ""story"" you tell about your product be informed by data <i>about the market of the people you're selling too</i>.  So, if you're selling software to,say, bolt & screw manufacturers in the Southeast, you need to know what's going on with bolt & screw manufacturers in the Southeast, what the trends are, what problems they face, and how to talk to them in terms that relate to <i>their problems</i> first and foremost, and NOT your product first and foremost.<p>So, here's your homework... go out and start researching bolt and screw manufacturing in the Southeast, identify some meaningful trends and patterns, come up with hard numbers, economic issues, etc., and then find a way to use that to use that to tie your product to a problem those guys are having.  And now write up a compelling educational brief for that market, which tells a good story, and educates, while contributing to demand for what you do.<p>Now come up with a great headline for your story that will capture someone's interest.<p>Now figure out how to get it in front of the people that need to see it.<p>Now call them and try to get a meeting so you can talk to them in person about the issues at hand.<p>Now do this for each identifiable target market you're pursuing (note: I'm referring mainly to B2B scenarios here, since that's what we do).<p>But wait, there's more... you also need to think about your ""ultimate strategic position"" and how all of your messaging contributes to that positioning, and about how to achieve ""top of mind awareness"" among your audience.  And for extra giggles, coordinate PR campaigns, manage events, do market research which is more ""product focused,"" etc., etc., etc.<p>Nah, this stuff is definitely not easy.  It's hard in a way that's different from hacking (which is what makes it fun, to be honest), but hard nonetheless.  I really have a newfound respect for the really good marketing people out there, and it's growing as I learn more about what marketing entails.  Hint: It's not just throwing a few Google Adwords out there and waiting for the money to roll in (well, not for most of us, anyway).<p>(aside: I'm taking a very broad view of marketing here.  I see marketing as a strategic component, which entails selecting the ideal customer segments, driving product decisions, receiving input/feedback from customers, determining the vision the company wants to communicate to the market, and communicating that to the market... as well as the tactical elements such as ""create brochure,"" ""create whitepaper,"" ""create screencast,"" ""organize PR campaign,"" ""do focus group,"" ""take pizza and t-shirts to hackathon,"" etc.)",1345570193

People who edit/moderate questions.<p>Even 2+ years ago there was a lot of lip service paid to the value of (3). I disagreed then and it's only been reaffirmed by subsequent events. To be clear: it's not that I think these functions have no value, it's that they are, at best, <i>secondary</i> to content creation.<p>The problem is that these roles without diligent oversight attract the wrong kinds of people (eg [1] [2] and a scandal a few years about an admin black list that I can't seem to find right now).<p>Take this question from Stackoverflow: <i>Database development mistakes made by application developers</i> [3], a question I spent some time answering and that people seemed to appreciate the answer to (based on comments and 1000+ upvotes). It is closed as ""not constructive"". This is hardly a unique phenomenon. We've all seen many interesting questions posted here that are now closed or locked and who knows how many have been deleted.<p>The kind of person you end up is overly pedantic and a real stickler for an arbitrary set of rules.<p>Editors/moderators are the bureaucrats of the Internet.<p>As Oscar Wilde said, The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.

It's rapidly going the way of the old Usenet days when anything interesting gets shot down and anything else gets closed and the OP lambasted for not having found the 17 previous duplicates. Not good.<p>The biggest problem I see is an extreme interpretation of what is ""subjective"". ""What language should I learn?"" is an obviously subjective question. In the absence of any concrete criteria, it's hard to give a useful answer.<p>But consider a question like ""What are the pros and cons of Sinatra vs Rails?"" This sort of question (IMHO) absolutely has value as someone experienced with both could enumerate the relative merits of each in a pretty objective fashion without making an absolute determination. This is something that absolutely could have value to anyone evaluating Ruby Web frameworks.<p>So, back to this post, what are the odds of any particular question being closed? it seems to be positively correlated with how much time has passed (since SO's inception) and how interesting the question is.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/wikipedia-admins-face-gauntlet-scrutiny-889502"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/technolog/wikipedia-admins...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/most-notorious-wikipedia-scandals.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.searchenginepeople.com/blog/most-notorious-wikipe...</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/621884/database-development-mistakes-made-by-application-developers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/621884/database-developme...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-expanding-to-meet-the-needs-of-the"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/130452-the-bureaucracy-is-ex...</a>",1345570032

The other issue I have is that people with other commitments (like a job) don't really stand a chance, it's usually very time-consuming to go from fifth place to first.",1345569980

This applies in consumer computers and high performance computers.<p>For a long time, processor architects were able to increase the frequency, increase the cache size, and increase the pipeline depth (to allow for more instructions in flight at the same time) to yield more powerful processors. As Moore predicted, processor architects kept getting more transistors to play with, and they were able to make processors more powerful by making designs that were ""like the old one, just more so."" But they've hit fundamental limits in the design: increasing the clock speed and the pipeline depth at the same time means that you have to communicate the same amount of data over a longer distance in a shorter amount of time in the silicon. We've hit the point where it's not feasible to do that anymore.<p>Hence, multicore. Processor architects are still getting more and more transistors to play with, so instead of using them to make a single core more powerful (as they did for a long time), they're using them to make multiple cores. But you no longer get the ""for free"" performance boosts that you did when you increased single-core performance.

Both say (to me) exactly the same thing at approximately the same level of abstraction; one does it with Lisp syntax and one in traditional C++ syntax. The question starts to arise after a while - what abstraction tools does the language make available. At what point do you need functions, classes, closures, m4 macros, lisp macros? Well, at the point when you need them. :-) These are all just tools to say exactly what you mean in as much code as you need.<p>If you have a social problem of a bunch of cowboys all whooping it up in your codebase, I don't think any technical solution is going to help you. :-)",1345569775

4413627,comment,4412905,4413150,6,0,JamesLeonis,,,"I would disagree about console gaming. A stretch this long happened before between the original NES and the SNES, as well as the original Gameboy and a more powerful version. From then on there was the 4 year like clockwork release of a new console system from every major manufacturer. In this cycle, none have any definite release date, stretching this generation to 8 or 9 years.<p>While I agree games propel hardware forward, I believe it's the combination of a graphics plateau, diversification in gaming, and the end of the free ride on Moore's Law, which the article pointed out. This generation of AAA games run arguably the prettiest graphics ever seen. But this comes at a cost of complexity and sheer hard work to build the environment and models, without the <i>wow</i> factor of a major leap in graphics quality. Crysis is still the Gold Standard in what gaming graphics can do, and that was released five years ago.<p>We are also seeing a large and unique divergence in gaming in the form of indie titles. Indie games, by their nature, could never compete pound-for-pound on the graphics of AAA games. They made up for this in experimental gameplay and embracing a unique graphics style. Before now it was very difficult to get an indie game exposure and the art of building said game was difficult. Now the game development toolchain has improved by orders of magnitude, and the advent of app stores on tablets and smart phones makes distribution and monetization much easier. Tablets and smartphones likewise bifurcated gaming. Tablets couldn't render the graphics or use the raw computational power found in the latest PC and console titles. This made them a natural home to indie titles.<p>There is also something to be said about Zynga, Facebook, and the whole crop of casual games that sprung up in the last five years. Suddenly the gaming market had many more diverse demographics they could effectively target. It's no longer the 18-25 year old male that was the prime gaming market. These titles don't need the raw computational power of next-gen consoles or the latest PC hardware. They run fine even on netbooks and tablets.<p>In all, I do believe that gaming was a primary driving factor in hardware development. In recent years video games have become a much more diverse ecosystem, many of which don't require the raw hardware power.",1345569426

It's not as if the arrival of Windows 7 was a surprise or the manufacturers don't know how to write Windows 7 drivers for their equipment. Chances are the next product range runs just fine on Windows 7 and its drivers are probably using a lot of the same driver code as before.<p>Obviously there <i>is</i> profit in these behaviours, because it forces customers to buy much more expensive high-end brands or to buy replacement equipment much sooner than they otherwise would have to.",1345569098

It isn't science until I try to explain what the spots are, and accept a possible falsification of my explanation.<p>All observations are preliminaries to science. All untested explanations are also preliminaries to science. Science is when an explanation for observations collides with reality, with an attempt to validate an explanation.<p>>  You're trying to paint me as a crazy pseudoscientist,<p>Not at all -- your words, not mine.<p>> you're working from a faulty perception of what science is.<p>I didn't invent the definition of science, and I'm simply repeating the definition that has come to be accepted, by consensus, among scientists, and in courts of law.<p>Guess how society keeps pseudoscience out of classrooms, for example, ""Creation Science""? They do it by asking scientists what science is, discovering that untested claims and observations don't count, and acting accordingly.<p>In McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education (<a href=""http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/mclean-v-arkansas.html</a>), Creation Science was determined not to be science because it failed to meet these scientific requirements:<p>""It is guided by natural law;<p>It has to be explanatory by reference to natural law;<p>It is testable against the empirical world;<p>Its conclusions are tentative, i.e. are not necessarily the final word; and<p>It is falsifiable.""<p>Observation doesn't meet these requirements (one cannot falsify an observation). Attempting to explain observations, and accepting falsifications, does.<p>> So you're saying that classification like taxonomy, the periodic table, and even SI units are 'not science', because these things are not due to a tested claim?<p>No, they aren't science because they only describe, they don't explain, and descriptions cannot be falsified -- that's reserved to explanations.<p>This, by the way, is why there is so little science in psychology -- it's mostly description, with rare attempts to explain. For example, Asperger's was accepted as a real mental illness based only on description.

Your designers can write straight up HTML and not worry about templating at all.<p>Of course, then it's on you as a developer to use Enlive to replace whatever stub/sample elements are present in the HTML with real data, so it's not an entirely free lunch.",1345568598

human perception is different for individual humans. Is a 10 inch 1024x768 display already retina, because many humans cannot see the pixel grid? Or is the 3.5 inch iphone 4 not retina, because a very healthy human eye can still see the pixels?<p>The distance is also very squishy attribute. From my experience, people look at a 10 inch tablet from about the same distance than they look at a smartphone. Still, Apple gave the ipad a lower minimum requirement for the Retina label than the iphone 4.<p>And does this mean I can ""retina"" and ""unretina"" a screen by moving closer/away from the screen?",1345568568

An array of solar concentrators could beam down just enough solar power downrange to make the exploration of the Kuiper belt and inner Oort cloud worthwhile (there is no loss in conversion since you&#x27;re redirecting photons all the way to the spacecraft). The alternative thing may be orbiting microwave relays that receive power from Earth and then beam it at the distant spacecraft (either as laser or microwave power).",1377763193

If Google is willing to revise the spec, this can probably be improved.</i><p><i>VP8, as an encoder, is somewhere between Xvid and Microsoft’s VC-1 in terms of visual quality.  This can definitely be improved a lot.</i><p><i>VP8, as a decoder, decodes even slower than ffmpeg’s H.264.  This probably can’t be improved that much; VP8 as a whole is similar in complexity to H.264.</i><p><i>With regard to patents, VP8 copies too much from H.264 for comfort, no matter whose word is behind the claim of being patent-free.  This doesn’t mean that it’s sure to be covered by patents, but until Google can give us evidence as to why it isn’t, I would be cautious.</i><p><i>VP8 is definitely better compression-wise than Theora and Dirac, so if its claim to being patent-free does stand up, it’s a big upgrade with regard to patent-free video formats.</i><p><i>VP8 is not ready for prime-time; the spec is a pile of copy-pasted C code and the encoder’s interface is lacking in features and buggy.  They aren’t even ready to finalize the bitstream format, let alone switch the world over to VP8.</i><p><i>With the lack of a real spec, the VP8 software basically is the spec–and with the spec being “final”, any bugs are now set in stone.  Such bugs have already been found and Google has rejected fixes.</i><p><i>Google made the right decision to pick Matroska and Vorbis for its HTML5 video proposal.</i>",1377762620

Well, good news, you don&#x27;t have to write a report to the product manager explaining why it&#x27;s going to take too long to implement and suggest three alternatives.  No, you just identify the problem, pick an alternative that achieves the overarching aim in a different manner, and implement it.<p>This effect is particularly insidious, because often the long slow complicated thing that the product manager wants is just the sort of interesting challenge that developers enjoy.  They don&#x27;t point out to the product manager that there is a simpler solution, because that would take away the shiny toy.

Vectorization is a big deal if you want to maximize performance.<p>I do agree, however, that this doesn&#x27;t make C/C++ necessary for game programming.

If anyone should like space solar power, it should be me. I got a rocket company and a solar company. I should be really on it, ya know. But it&#x27;s like, super obviously, not going to work because, ya know, if you have solar panels - first of all, it has to be better than having solar panels on Earth, so then you say, okay, solar panel is on-orbit, you get twice the solar energy - assuming that it is out of Earth&#x27;s shadow - but you&#x27;ve gotta do a double conversion. You&#x27;ve gotta convert it from photon to electron to photon, back to electron. You&#x27;ve got to make this double conversion, so, okay, what&#x27;s your conversion efficiency? Hmm. All in, you&#x27;re going to have a real hard time even getting to 50%. [The solar cells are better.] It does not matter, put that cell on Earth then. See, that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making. Take any given solar cell, is it better to have it on Earth, or is it better to have it on orbit? What do you get from being in orbit? You get twice as much sun - best case - but you&#x27;ve got to do a conversion. You&#x27;ve got to convert it the energy to photons - well, you have incoming photons that go to electrons, but you - you&#x27;ve gotta do two conversions that you don&#x27;t have to do on Earth, which is you&#x27;ve got to turn those electrons into photons and turn those photons back into electrons on the ground, and that double conversion is going to get you back to where you started, basically. So why are you bothering sending them to bloody space. &quot;I wish I could just stab that bloody thing through the heart.&quot; BTW - electron to photon converters are not free and nor is sending stuff to space. Then it obviously super doesn&#x27;t work. Case closed. You&#x27;d think. You&#x27;d think case closed, but no. I guarantee it&#x27;s gunna come up another ten times.

You fill out a form and get a score which tells to which degree you are depressed, if any.<p>This ranges from normal and functioning, with occasional negative feelings within the normal (i.e. not depressed), to delibitating symptoms: Staying in bed for days straight, finding no joy in any activity, never sleeping properly, unable to relate to the people around you. Depression is usually diagnosed if you have been feeling like this for more than two weeks straight.

So while you&#x27;re parsing the CSS you can be getting the images, offsetting the connection cost.<p>In the CSS case, the device needs to get the (slightly larger) CSS, un-gzip it (with more complex tables), Base64 decode - and then decode the image as before.

I&#x27;ve spent a great deal of time thinking about what we did wrong, and, honestly, we did a lot wrong. All the usual things that people warn you about in fact. We built a product that no one <i>really</i> wanted. All the feedback was tremendously positive, but the reality was that the problem we were trying to solve was merely annoying rather than painful, so we failed to get any sort of proper traction. We spent far more time on product than on marketing or selling. We added features that were amazingly clever and cool, but that only affected 5% of the users. We used the newest technologies. We deluded ourselves that our idea was huge when it really wasn&#x27;t. And so on. It was a catalogue of errors.<p>Then we ran out of money. Obviously.<p>Since I&#x27;ve been tremendously &#x27;down&#x27; in what can only be described as a &quot;mourning period&quot; that felt <i>very</i> much like grieving.

I needed it to.<p>Thankfully though, through the amazing and supportive network of friends and family, I think I&#x27;ve bounced back a bit.

It&#x27;s much harder in the hardware sector or when you invent car technology. Getting into those markets is expensive. Forging a deal with a car manufacturer, for instance, would put you in an extremely weak negotiating position. Patents give you some leverage and a defense mechanism when they go and use it without your permission.<p>So I also think ARM is a valid example of companies that wouldn&#x27;t be alive if not for the patent system.<p>All that said, I&#x27;m not in favor of patents at all. Thinking of something should not give you ownership over a broad concept. Information should be shared freely, to improve upon and so everyone can enjoy the invention.",1377759879

The atmosphere is well stocked with water at varying, often unpredictable levels. Wasting beam energy on heating up passing water molecules is kinda pointless, so the frequencies chosen pass through without interacting.<p>So no. A beam going off axis will not set your city on fire.<p>In terms of the actual concept, the original book to read is Gerard O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 1976 <i>The High Frontier</i>.

Search for JS game engines, and try out each one. Download their sample projects and run them. Read through the code. Instrument it with console.log&#x27;s. Step through it with a debugger if necessary. Then start modifying the sample projects to add new little features.<p>After you&#x27;re done playing with the sample projects, dig into the source of the JS game engine. Learn how it&#x27;s done.

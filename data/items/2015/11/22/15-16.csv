Scorcese almost killing off again Cinecittà with his fatal Gangs of New York epic didn&#x27;t help, Passion of Christ and the fire in a big Cinecittà hall 2007 neither.<p>But since 2000 Italian cinema is the most exciting in Europe again. They are the only ones who successfully experiment in new visual aesthetic with the new available camera technology. It&#x27;s not only Paolo Sorrentini (Camera: Luca Bigazzi)\n  * L&#x27;uomo in più (2001) \n  * Le conseguenze dell&#x27;amore (2004)\n  * L&#x27;amico di famiglia (2006)\n  * Il Divo (2008)\nand then his famous ones, but also Zapruder Filmmakersgroup (Nadia Ranocchi, David Zamagni, Camera: Monaldo Moretti) with &quot;All Inclusive 3D&quot; (2010), Luca Guadagnino, Salvatore Maira, Michelangelo Frammartino and in the last years many more. Compare it e.g. to the current decline of the french movies.<p>The directors with which the decline of the Italian cinema started were\nGianno Amelio, Guiseppe Tornatore, Roberto Benigni, Gabriele Salvatores, Franco Zeffirelli and Silvio Soldini.

Actually, neither is Slackware.<p>I find sbopkg and SlackBuilds.org to be better than yaourt and AUR. sbopkg&#x27;s UI is just top notch (ncurses-based).<p>Slackware uses sysvinit with flat rc scripts as opposed to the traditional System V setup of numbered symlink farms. Much cleaner. Arch uses systemd.<p>Slackware&#x27;s pkgtools are much more minimalistic than pacman. They&#x27;re shell functions that manage local tarballs. In addition, you have slackpkg for fetching remote updates.<p>Slackware actually double-functions as both a rolling and stable release distribution. You can either set slackpkg to track -current, which is often bleeding edge yet surprisingly robust, or stick to official versions like 14.1.<p>Slackware&#x27;s installer and setup utilities are all ncurses-driven rather than pure CLI as in Arch. I actually find them much more capable. The only pure CLI part of installing Slackware is disk partitioning, the rest is a highly detailed TUI menu installer (similar to FreeBSD if you&#x27;ve tried that).<p>Slackware has a very strict devotion to not patching upstream packages <i>at all</i>, with exceptions only in the most critical circumstances. This means that you&#x27;re pretty much always using vanilla Linux userland as it is, and so if there&#x27;s bugs, you report to upstream rather than to the distribution tracker. If you&#x27;re a developer, this is great.<p>Slackware&#x27;s package management can alternate between binary and source-based.<p>As such, I&#x27;d recommend Slack.

Hell, I can&#x27;t even get a normal Digital Ocean server instance to programmatically drop and recreate doing minimal things like creating a user and setting SSH keys. I suppose if I wanted to learn something heavyweight like Chef or Puppet I could, but for now, I just maintain a list of commands to run, and understand that Digital Ocean servers can&#x27;t quite be treated like livestock just yet, though I can fake it pretty well. Eventually Digital Ocean will get around to making the platform changes, which are all already in feature request.<p>Engineering time is very limited and the support cases are exponentially large. The author wanted MongoDB supported in the hard case. Well, that means you also need to support 4 or 5 other, similar databases the same way.<p>If you want a bleeding-edge PaaS with corporate support, you should expect to pay corporate prices. If the project / organization doesn&#x27;t allow for that, then either the requirements or the mindset is off-kilter.<p>I think the what the author is really mad about is the vendor lock-in. That used to bother me too, until I realized that learning new platforms is done on my employer&#x27;s dime and not mine.<p>A few more years, and some other challenge will be on the bleeding edge and this one will be mostly solved, meaning that open-source community solutions will exist that you can build once and forget about it.

But on a more serious note, corporate world will give you exposure to a lot of things that startups may not. For example, when you work in corporate world, you will learn about red tape, bureaucracies etc that will teach you a lot. You will get to meet tons of people working for big companies and you can actually build a really good network.<p>In really big corporate companies, you will learn how different teams use different tools, methodologies and you may have to work directly/indirectly with many tools, processes etc. In startups, probably not so much specially when the team is really small. For example, I saw at least 10 different systems just for project management when in my corporate job and I probably would never be able to compare each if not that exposure. I hated it but that&#x27;s the point. Now I know :)<p>I worked in the corporate world for 10+ years before I went into the bootstrapped product mode. My best achievement in the corporate world ? The extensive network of amazing people I met during those years.

These two features definitely differentiate Firefox from Chrome and Safari, and do so in a useful way. There have been times that Tab Groups was the sole reason I stuck with Firefox. There have been times that the sole reason I did not move to Chrome was knowing I could never 100% personalize the GUI. Throw in the how Mozilla handled the DRM issue as well as Pocket and new tab sponsored websites fiasco and you begin to erode the privacy reasons for sticking with Firefox. Yes, Firefox must compete, must stay competitive, but if it becomes just another Chrome, there is no way they can compete with the resources Google can bring to the table. Firefox must compete on product differentiation or it will lose.",1448204448

They are &quot;encouraging&quot; customers to stream video, as long as that video doesn&#x27;t need to come via an upstream Internet handoff.<p>So, by an extension of this logic, Comcast customers should be able to stream peer-to-peer traffic within the network without it counting towards monthly caps.<p>Technically, upstream and downstream data has different &quot;costs&quot; in a cable network, so I could see an argument where Comcast claims that upstream traffic, even in a peer-to-peer setup, has costs associated with it.  But, I think that by making statements and policies like this one, Comcast is actually slowly eroding their ability to limit and cap data, they are introducing loopholes and work-arounds that could actually be used against them.",1448204447

I think that if we move toward a sort of neural network programming (1) we won&#x27;t be able to &quot;know why&quot; in the sense that we can explain the functions, but will instead explain programs based on output from the layers and from the relationships between variables.  For instance, deep dream<i></i> is a way to understand how google&#x27;s image classifier is &quot;working&quot; (2). It&#x27;s super interesting that the classifier thinks that a human arm is part of a dumbbell, for instance.<p>1) Maybe something like this: <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/art.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.mit.edu/~axch/www/art.pdf</a>.<p>2) <a href=""http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleresearch.blogspot.ch/2015/06/inceptionism-going...</a>",1448204428

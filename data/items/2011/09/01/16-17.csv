Just like the TouchPad went ionospheric at that price, the sub $100 phone with that kind of power would likely do the same.<p>The issue isn't just carrier subsidy in this case, having an uber-cheap Android phone will open up huge markets that are currently underserved by smart phones (Africa, anyone?).  There are projects afoot that would greatly benefit from seriously cheap, capable hardware right now--my friend is working on a water finder project for rural areas in poor countries (think Botswana in the sticks) to help track well quality and production.  This is a huge issue for these areas and having something that is as powerful as Android with GPS and network capabilities is a game changer.<p>At $310, that's a harder sell.

Now add to his base salary: benefits (15% for health insurance, 401k matching), job-loss risk (25%, since typical severance offers are 1/4 tenure at current salary), career risk and opportunity cost (15%), and overage hours (30%, assuming a 50-55 hour work week). That's $185,000 per year. Take that, less the $50,000 he's making, and his sweat equity is $135,000 per year. Over 4 years, that's $540,000. The company's valuation is $2.5 million, ""pre"" to his contributions. He should be getting about 16% of the company, assuming he remains for 4 years.

2950745,comment,2949534,2949534,28,0,sp4rki,,,"Very few people argue that designers should learn how to code (as in programming). What most people argue though, is that WEB designers should be able to code, as in do the markup and CSS, their own designs. If they aren't able to code their own designs, how can they know the limitations imposed on their designs by current (and old) technologies?<p>A designer does not need to know how to do AJAX, jQuery animation, MVC, Ruby (or Python, or C#, or Java...), an SQL dialect, Linq queries, how to configure nginx to serve your statics, and a whole plethora of things that are important when creating a product for the web. A bunch of different people and skill sets are needed for all of those, and no one person can wear all hats. That being said, a designer that designs for the web needs to know the medium on which they're creating their artwork on. I do oil painting, and I know I need to know how to frame my canvas with a stretcher or strainer. I know that I need to prepare my canvas with animal glue, chalk, and white lead paint. I need to know my brushes and their properties also, wether they're made hair from a horse, camel, squirrel, sable, etc... I need to know a myriad of different things that are NOT actually painting. I'm also an avid strength training aficionado, for which I've learned more about the human physiology and the mechanics of lifting weights and their effect on your muscles and nervous system than I care to remember. I need to know a myriad of things that are NOT how to lift weights correctly. If I'm a web designer, and I make pretty pictures for the web, I need to know my medium. I need to know how to code my own markup and I need to know how to make my own CSS. Only then will I know the limitations and the mechanics of how a ""webpage"" works. Hell, creating a good creative design is a lot harder than doing the markup and CSS to be delivered to a front end developer who will probably end up changing a lot of it anyways.<p>The point of web designers knowing how to do their html and css, is not to remove another person from the conveyor belt of web products. The point of designers knowing how to do so, is to make sure you've got a design that works beautifully and that goes hand in hand with all the standards and best practices that the project requires. If I'm going to hire a web designer that doesn't know how to do his own html and css, I immediately think that he's not really a WEB designer and that he doesn't really care to be the best he can be as a WEB designer. Regardless of his actual skill as a designer, and of course, I won't hire him. If I get a designer that doesn't know how to do so, but wants to learn... I'll probably hire him because of his attitude and aptitude for learning. As long as he's actually good as a designer of course.<p>I'll just end this already too long post with one 'though': Valve (as per the latest articles going around the web) hires mostly multi skilled people, as opposed to people that are one trick ponies. The developers to my sides (no I don't work at Valve) are both completely multifaceted people with a myriad of skill sets not directly related to making software, but that we use almost every day. I consider them some of the best I've ever met. I've done system admin in linux, bsd, and windows, and I'm pretty knowledgeable in all three. I've developed software for the past 15 years. I've also been designing for the last 10. I'm pretty decent (and I've studied and practiced my ass of to get to that point) in all those fields, but you can't be bothered to learn HTML and CSS so you can make YOUR web designs better? Give me a freaking break.",1314895900

A designer who can only mock things up in photoshop is not a designer, but an artist, and probably a poor artist at that.<p>> <i>Knowing what is very different by knowing how.

They aren't engineers, but they certainly have an overlapping knowledge base.  If all they could do is draw fancy buildings, then they would not be architects, but artists.

Yes, a director needs to know how to act.  They might not be the best actor, but they should know the craft, or they can't get good performances out of their actors.

Startups employ dummies all the time, and you can't tell because everyone is too busy to pay attention, they're good at playing politics, they're friends with one of the founders, or they <i>are</i> one of the founders.

But politics comes into play whenever you have 3 or more people.  Granted, the politics may be easier to understand and manage, but they're much more ugly than in a big company.<p>In short, it sounds like the author found a good startup to work for, which is usually better than most BigCos.  But it's all downhill from there.  If the author stays in the startup game for long enough, I guarantee he'll work for a company that will make him miss BigCos and their rules (some of which benefit the employee).",1314894440

And because DNS is at a lower layer of the stack than TLS, those failures will be more severe.<p>For instance, read any tutorial on socket programming, or browse socket code on Github or Google Code Search.

Certainly not Amazon and Google.<p>What we have on the Internet is a failure of security policy. It's a human factors problem and a UX problem, not a failure of the core Internet protocols. By acting like a band-aid on those core protocols is going to fix the problem, we:<p>* defer the real solution to the problem for another 10 years while we wait-and-see whether DNSSEC helps (hint: it won't really)<p>* make it even harder to apply UX solutions to the problem by pushing the decisions that need to be made further down the stack<p>* incur costs and instability and yes probably a good deal of security flaws to no good end.",1314893999

Managing state is the challenge of computation! As you add states and transitions, the complexity increases dramatically, exponentially in some cases. This is why novice programmers struggle to manage developing large applications: they depend on global state and side-effects to perform computation rather than creating isolated components (classes, methods/functions)<p>That is why we use higher level abstractions provided by programming languages. We use state machines unknowingly in our code every time we have a switch or a conditional statement. When we use design patterns such as the GoF state pattern, we are implementing a state machine. When we build closures in functional languages, those can be considered state machines (in an abstract way). It's just that we're doing it in a more intuitive, higher-level way.<p>What I'm getting at is that computer programs inherently contain state machines. Recall from computer science that a a stored program computer (e.g. Turing machine, Von Neumann architecture) is just a state machine with an unlimited memory. When we deal with more complexity, it's not wise to attempt to model the problem with a state machine.

Some small companies get some guy in charge who was previously mired in the bureaucracy somewhere and starts trying to impose that on the little company. Disaster ensues.<p>On the other end, you can get a good startup feel by finding a good team in a big company/institution (usually you see this in Academia, but some places in companies have this too). A well built group will have some admin staff (secretaries, hands off project managers, etc.) to insulate the core team from the crazy. When done well, this admin group will fill out the crap forms, hide various money absurdities, deflect outside poisoners and otherwise do amazing things to keep the non-admin folks blissfully ignorant.[1] The bosses in such a group will create or emulate a flat reporting structure, and not let the external politics apply too much pressure or influence to the team. The core team will then get to do their thing in a way that feels very much like a small company or startup.<p>There are benefits and drawbacks to this of course. Benefits include having a giant name behind you, and the awesome funding and legal resources available -- I was once told ""you think you need a cluster... we can buy one, just make sure first"". Awesome. Customers say ""Oh $BIG_NAME no need to jump you through these sill hoops to prove yourself"". And of course, the feeling of stability provided by being in the employ of a giant. On the drawback side: you do more work than a lot of your peers outside the group -- not a big deal but sometimes mentally taxing. Politics can creep in, so you need to maintain high productivity and always do a good job, so the bosses can preserve the group by selling it as ""ninja rockstar team alpha"" to everyone else. And no matter how good the shielding, sometimes the crazy still can creep in.<p>So basically, this is a long winded way of saying: if you are careful, you may be able to find the startup feel in a big company, or at least the good parts of it.<p>[1] I'm fully convinced that good admin staff are worth the same as good programmers in this type of situation. In my current employment I travel a lot, but have never filled out an expense report, I dump some receipts with the admin, answer a few questions, and she takes care of the rest of the voodoo. Similarly with the HR rep for insurance we have. Purchases are a simple ""hey I need, can you charge it to..."". I know there are forms and procedures -- I've heard horror stories. When we need a new person we tend to churn a bit til we find a good one, then it's a quick raise and lots of flattery to keep him/her around.

UsherBuddy is a solution that venues can use to offer last-minute tickets to consumers. Compare it to the TKTS booths but on the web, not only broadway, and catered towards residents and not tourists!<p>For consumers: Last-minute usually means a discount to go out and discover something new. If the show is really popular the venue can increase the price if they would like. Event discovery on a budget, if you will.<p>For venues: Seats at a venue are perishable. Incremental revenue is where they make money, so we try to help them fill the seats while still getting something for the seat. This is similar to Goldstar or Stubdog, but by doing it last-minute we hope to get rid of the cannibalization of sales that those services promote.<p>Currently, we have venues signed up and are just trying to gauge the initial consumer reaction. Would love to hear your thoughts. Thanks!",1314893120

There is no release manager or schedule.  Maintaining reliability in this environment is a fun challenge!<p>Our team has three main goals:<p>* Write tools to help the other engineers know when it is safe to deploy.<p>* Create monitoring tools to detect issues before users do, fix them automatically if possible, and if not, contact the right people as quickly as possible.<p>* Take charge of outages and lead the calls until they are resolved and then follow up to make sure the root cause has been found and fixed.<p>So if this sounds like something interesting to you, you can send your resume to me at jedberg@netflix.com, and if you have any questions about the job, feel free to comment here (but don't email for questions, because I'd rather answer them here were everyone can see the answer).<p>Here's a discussion about the job on reddit:<p><a href=""http://www.reddit.com/comments/jyaqd/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/comments/jyaqd/</a><p>Here is the full job description from the jobs site:<p>Netflix is the world's leading streaming video service, and our growth is accelerating.

You will build tools to monitor, automatically fix and/or proactively notify service owners of problems before customers notice.  You will drive incident resolution and follow through on finding root causes and getting them fixed.<p>You are an expert in distributed, highly concurrent, web-scale systems that are fault-tolerant and run 24x7 with unparalleled availability. You are a talented devops engineer and you thrive on managing and maintaining a reliable environment that others depend on.<p>You possess these qualities:<p>* You see the big picture delivering a 24x7 service<p>* You are effective working with multiple teams<p>* You have high standards in everything you do<p>* You can balance multiple tasks<p>You have these skills:<p>* Great communication skills, both verbal and written<p>* In-depth experience operating a 24x7 production environment<p>* Fluent in Linux: RedHat, CentOS, Fedora, Ubuntu<p>* Strong scripting and programming skills (were going to ask you to write code on the whiteboard)<p>* Familiar with the Java platform, especially JVM configuration and JMX<p>* Knowledgeable in Linux packaging tools: rpm, yum, dpkg, apt<p>* Ability to quickly triage problems, determine root cause and drive resolution<p>* Ability to keep a cool head under pressure and effectively participate in system down crisis situations<p>You may even have these skills:<p>* Expertise in one or more of the following: Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, shell<p>* Prior experience with Amazon EC2/S3 or other cloud service providers<p>* Building systems deployment and service management automation tools<p>* Familiarity with large scale systems and methodologies<p>If this sounds interesting then we want to hear from you!",1314893035

But I think the problem is that we're blurring the distinction between founder and employee.<p>I remember an old quote ""founders get rich, early employees get screwed, and late employees get paid.""  I've worked for startups where I received a miniscule percentage of the company.  But they paid me market rate and provided me with a health plan.  The equity was nice, but this was really just a job... ok, it was more than ""just a job"", I did pursue it with more passion, and there was less stability (and one of them did tank leaving everyone scrambling), but the equity was really a bonus in exchange for the lack of stability and perhaps a more passionate workforce, but it wasn't a stand-in for a substantially below market rate paycheck.<p>So I agree, 20% equity is a massive amount to give to an ""employee"" who is not a founder.  But a 50% pay cut is a massive amount to ask of an ""employee"" who will not be treated as a founder.  That sounds more like the kind of arrangement that might normally be worked out between a couple of founders, where one needs an income and agrees to lower the equity share in exchange, whereas the other goes without income at all.<p>In this case, it does sound like the early employee may be getting a little screwed, because his deal is the worst of both worlds - working for ""free"" (well half the time) like a founder, but receiving miniscule equity, like an employee.",1314892908

Many excellent books are available where what shines through the pages is the author's experience in writing good code, explaining the logic of how he or she arrived at it, and then solving small problems which might come as exercies at the end.<p>University degrees, learning on the job, etc will only get you so far ahead, but to leap ahead in your productivity, it's best to learn from the real giants in the field.<p>Programming is a field that constantly changes. Reading, Applying, and learning new skills, and new techniques is part of the skill-set needed to survive. Great books are a complement to hands-on experimentation in this regard and cannot be over estimated as more and more learning is often self-learning since it's difficult to always find good mentors.",1314892862

and the default will be NO.
At least let's hope it is a prompt, Facebook may simply choose to disable it.<p>There is a perfect storm right now of too many user complaints about application spam, competitors like Hi5 and numerous others circling, and a desire to go public without an ability to do it until the requisite time has past.  A lot can happen in that time frame.  I think we can expect Facebook to do whatever their user base asks them to do.  Why?  Because if those user metrics dip at all prior to the exit attempt they are screwed.",1183089071

If you do, maybe you shouldn't be doing a startup.<p>Graduate students write theses single-handedly all the time; nobody tells a PhD student that they need to find a co-author to help them write their thesis.  Yes, graduate students have supervisors, but the amount of supervision varies wildly; in my (admittedly extreme) case, I only talked to my supervisor twice between ""here's some research I've done, do you think it's enough for a thesis"" and ""here's my final draft, please look it over before I submit it next week"".<p>If you need a co-founder to do something which you can't do (business, coding in an area you're not familiar with, etc.) or don't have time to do, you should absolutely go out and get one.  But I don't think ""I'm too lazy to get anything done unless I have a co-founder"" to be a very good reason, and I certainly don't think ""'cause pg says so"" is a good reason.",1183088541

They like it when there is two people (what if you get hit by a bus)<p>If you have a good co-founder you can get more work done, or they can deal with business related issues like marketing and legal stuff or do design (I am really bad at making my applications look good)",1183086204

However, we were targeted for acquisition by a major software company, who pulled out (due to having made a different, but unrelated major acquisition).

1806760,comment,1806601,1806601,0,0,quant18,,,"Red is not a uniformly positive colour in any of these countries. For example, in China (and in Japan too, I believe), writing in red is traditionally associated with death threats. And I don't know of any social network using a reddish colour scheme. Closest I can think of are <a href=""http://mixi.jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mixi.jp/</a> which uses orange, <a href=""http://vsetut.uz/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vsetut.uz/</a> which uses pink, and <a href=""http://ibox.mn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ibox.mn</a> which uses a red bar on a dark blue background. Many popular sites both corporate and social seem to use blue regardless of the country. Vkontakte and Renren are already mentioned. Naizuud from Mongolia (<a href=""http://naizuud.mn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://naizuud.mn</a>) is another one, for example.<p>Local social network sites can get a toehold because Facebook or Friendster are not localised in their language, so they start as ""clones"". But that's just the start. It's stupid to look down on them just because they copied an interface or a few ideas. They grow (and their other local competitors die) because they execute well in <i>their</i> market. E.g. Renren may <i>look</i> a lot like Facebook, but the actual workings of the site are a lot different --- the two most obvious differences being that you can see who visited your profile, and game mechanics play a much larger role (e.g. you get ""level up"" by logging in for n consecutive days, giving you profile badges and the like). This annoys the living hell out of me, but I'm guessing most of their users like it, otherwise they'd be on another site instead.<p>Thanks to the Great Firewall, the Renren users don't have the option of going to Facebook, so there's no direct competition there, yet. But local sites can survive against international competitors as long as they execute well. Korean search engine/portal Naver is still going strong, because they continued to come up with strategies to stay ahead of their competition and keep their site as a destination (incentivising user-generated content, entering into tie-ups with local newspapers, putting printed dictionaries and encyclopedias online for free, etc.).<p>And on the other hand, Korean social networking site Cyworld executed extremely poorly, which is why they are struggling now. Ten years ago I knew plenty of people with Cyworld accounts --- Korean international students I studied with, and even Korean Americans (who couldn't even sign up on their own, but had to use their relatives' citizen ID numbers to sign up!). Then in 2006 Cyworld announced they were going to try to enter into the USA market. But they didn't leverage the existing userbase at all --- instead they created walled gardens for the USA and China which were completely separate from their Korean network. So of course I didn't bother signing up, and neither did hundreds of thousands of other people <i>who all had friends with Cyworld Korea accounts</i> and who certainly would have signed up if it would have connected them to their Korean friends. Oops. (The lack of support for anything but IE didn't help either). And now, all the Koreans who were studying abroad when Facebook started getting big have graduated and are going back to Korea for work (and getting all their domestic friends onto Facebook too).<p>Mongolia has the opposite story: the local search engines like Haih couldn't come up with any strategy to become profitable and are now defunct.  The only feature they offered was Mongolian-language search. Google didn't --- and still doesn't --- handle Mongolian stemming. If you search just for ""Ulaanbaatar"", you won't find Ulaanbaatarad (in Ulaanbaatar), Ulaanbaatariin (Ulaanbaatar's), etc. But Mongolian stemming didn't make any money for Haih, and they had no strategy beyond ""copy Google"" (right down to the logo design). In contrast, at least for now, the local Mongolian social networks (Naizuud, Banjig 360, Ibox, etc.) are doing great --- plenty of Mongolians have accounts on Mixi or Facebook, but at least for now they're happy to keep using both the international sites <i>and</i> the local sites. Wonder how long that will last. Interesting times!",1287487219

I particularly like your (.bar.baz foo) syntax.</i><p>Thanks!<p><i>And good on you for moving away from bytecode generation; I also found that to be a dead end.</i><p>Glad to hear I'm not the only one.  :-)<p><i>So what are your plans for macros+namespaces? Will macros from imports live in the same namespace?</i><p>Actually, I hadn't thought about it--I haven't gotten to the point of being able to write modules in Adder.  I think I see what you mean, though: any module has to be a Python module, so macros would have to be expressed as functions.<p>Strawman: the module could contain a variable listing the macros.  When compiling an (import) form, the Adder compiler would check the imported module for that list, and update its internal structures accordingly.<p><i>And what did you mean by ""Python supports only two levels of lexical scope""</i><p>That was a mistake; I've removed it.  I think maybe I just didn't figure out how to generate bytecode for a triply nested function.<p>Of course, there is the remaining problem that Python can't define a scope without defining a function.  I didn't want to use the standard tactic for turning (let) into a nested function (I don't trust Python functions to be fast enough), so the current compiler uses name mangling, tagging each variable with the scope depth.  (Global variables are untagged, so that they can be accessed cleanly by Python modules.)",1287487180

If Apple thought Facebook's terms for Ping integration were unreasonable, the terms of a deal would likely be even more disagreeable. But even that aside, look at where Apple lacks control currently. They would likely want to plug a shortcoming there. The two places that leap to mind are manufacturing and wireless service. Jobs must be so annoyed that they have to depend on contract manufacturing. One of the primary reasons they didn't move more product this quarter was supply. The Apple of old did a lot of their own manufacturing. Likewise, dealing with wireless network providers has got to be a drag.

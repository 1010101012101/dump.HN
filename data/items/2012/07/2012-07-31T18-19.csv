4319028,comment,4317313,4317313,9,0,dredmorbius,,,"The GNOME team really doesn't get it.<p>When you've got your own people, tons of power users, ordinary users, and key kernel devs telling you you've gone astray, something's wrong.  What we're seeing is fortress mentality and hunkering down.  Wrong move.<p>Ted T'so has commented on his desktop woes at length on G+.  I lifted one a reply he made to his own post which I feel gets to the heart of the problem, and what is really necessary for a desktop solution (probably XFCE4 for most people these days).  Note that Ted's including both GNOME and KDE in his criticisms:<p><i>My concern with KDE is how bloated it's become.   I don't want highly integrated applications.   My main applications are a terminal, emacs, open office, and the Chrome browser.  I do way more with web applications these days.   Bloat is bad not just because of the increased disk and ram usage (although I do worry about that); bloat is bad because of the complexity.   The more you rely on an Object broker, the more it becomes harder and harder to fix things when they break --- and things do break, with appalling regularity.  It's the fact that Xfce and Network-Manager uses D-Bus and PolicyKit which is why I still get asked for my password from time to time even with my localauthority hack.   How do I fix it?   Who knows?</i><p><i>Unfortunately wicd isn't fully-featured enough, but it has as a huge win the fact that it doesn't use PolicyKit; it just uses a simple Unix group membership check for its access control.  Once wicd can handle large numbers of access points with the same wireless network, I'll be removing network manager from my system and using wicd instead, because network manager is just too damn complicated, and relies on too much complex infrastructure which I can't debug because of the !@#@! D-Bus design.   KDE is no better in this regard, and in fact it may be worse.</i><p><i>Why don't I use Openbox?  It's too simple.   For one thing, it doesn't support 3x3 workspaces.   At the end of the day, I want a desktop environment that makes the things that I do simple.  Which means wireless roaming, the terminal, emacs, open office, and a browser.   Anything more than that increases the memory and disk usage, but worse, it means more infrastructure which can break, which means I end up having to debug things like PolicyKit.   And that's just not productive time for me.  So Xfce seems like the right balance point for now, although it definitely still has some rough edges.</i><p><a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/117091380454742934025/posts/VjbFCa7X5NJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://plus.google.com/u/0/117091380454742934025/posts/VjbF...</a><p>Once again: HN needs a proper blockquote markdown.",1343760859

4319025,comment,4316685,4317462,1,0,Jach,,,"This is basically the GPL vs. BSD/MIT/Apache vs. Public Domain debate. I've been on all sides at various points, currently I'm on the side of the GPL for ""big stuff I want total copyright over (requiring people to sign copyright waivers)"" which lets me change the license later or give out proprietary licenses at a fee. For other stuff that may be useful to someone and that I don't care about, I like the MIT license or the Do-what-the-fuck-you-want-version-3 license. If I don't care, I'll either forget to mention or it will be public domain.<p>The problem with public domain is that outside of the US, in some countries ""public domain"" is actually <i>more</i> restrictive than e.g. the MIT license. So if you want to help users worldwide, you either need to research local laws or use a simple US-law-based license.<p>The benefit of the GPL, as I like to phrase it, is that it chains its users with freedom whether they like it or not. It's a very viral license and infects a lot that it touches. (Some businesses are even worried that the GPLv3 is vague enough that ""distribution"" could mean over the web, which would make the AGPLv3 redundant.) If you look at Stallman's free software song, particularly the part that goes ""When we have enough free software/at our call, hackers, at our call/we'll kick out those dirty licenses/evermore, hackers, evermore"", you can interpret that as saying once enough software respects user freedoms by default, then yes, we don't need the concept of licenses anymore to force it upon them. The GPL uses copyright as a weapon, as do the Copyleft folks, as do the MIT/etc license folks. As a side quip, this is also similar to basic Communist philosophy: you just need totalitarian control for a little while to set everything up, then the government can dissolve itself and everyone will continue working together.<p>The MIT/etc. license folks subscribe to the idea that the more things you can do, the more freedom you have. While this is true as a single developer, if you again take into account the end-user freedom then the utilitarian argument can go either way. A program licensed under the GPL makes sure all users of that program and its derivatives are free, regardless of its popularity. A program licensed under the MIT leaves the door open for someone to take that code and put it into another program that's licensed under something restrictive, and all of that program's users are not free. However, some programs don't become popular precisely because of the (A)GPL, whereas an MIT project that's used in a popular project (regardless of that derivative project being MIT) often becomes popular itself.<p>So for the GPL, the total freedom utility is just num_users for the program and all its derivatives. For MIT, if a non-free user is as bad as a free user is good, it's num_users_under_free_license - num_users_under_nonfree. You can see what needs to be satisfied to choose one over the other. There's also a factor involved for profit if you or someone else wants to make money on the software without the risk of legal source-or-binary redistributions.<p>I think Stallman recognizes the tradeoffs as well, I've read somewhere he doesn't like but accepts the idea of software (such as video games) initially launching as proprietary while it's in its peak profit window (first few weeks for games, traditionally, though that is changing with DLC), and then later relicensing as open source. Same thing with dual licensing.",1343760819

First, while we had a surprisingly positive response from the vendors, there was no realistic chance that we could get all of them to carry it. That would mean going back to the bad old days of scouring compatibility lists before buying hardware, and that's fundamentally user-hostile. Secondly, it would put Fedora in a privileged position. As one of the larger distributions, we have more opportunity to talk to hardware manufacturers than most distributions do. Systems with a Fedora key would boot Fedora fine, but would they boot Mandriva? Arch? Mint? Mepis?

You also have to calculate the tax rate on the sales as well.<p>If you're grossing $10,000 and you spent $2000 on records, 8 hours of labor (paying yourself $15 per hour) + the cost of the facilities (let's say $100 for the day) and $150 on marketing.<p>You'll still pay sales tax on the full $10,000. Let's say your sales tax rate is 8%, that means $800 in sales taxes. So now, you're at $9200, so now we can subtract your costs, which, according to my hypothetical approximations total $2370. If you want to exclude your labor cost, you can do that, but it'll still be taxes one way or another, depending on how you claim it.<p>So your profit is $9200-$2370 which is $6830. For a short term capital gain (which is what this is,) the rate is approximately 25% for Federal, however you also have state capital gains taxes (it's either taxed as ordinary income or as a capital gain,) which will be about 7% (depending on the state), but that 7% is taken off the total gain of $6830. (25% + 7%) of $6830 = $4645.<p>From the $15 per hour you get paid from your wages, you'll then get to pay social security, self-employment and medicare taxes on top of the federal income taxes. You can avoid this by not paying the salary, but you can't work for free in the eyes of the IRS.. you'll either pay the tax on the wages, or the total gets added to the profit and taxed as a capital gain. Of course, you'll get a slight home ""office"" deduction for using your backyard as a facility, of course that gets offset by the facilities fee you've earned (and will be taxes on.) It's cheaper though, to charge yourself the facilities fee because that comes off the capital gain, which lowers the taxes on the gain, while only nominally increasing your personal tax (due to deductions.)<p>Let's just round the total profit at $4600.<p>So, $150 in Facebook ads to earn $4600.. still a pretty nice ROI, but it certainly isn't $10,000.<p>We all know the seller isn't going to go to this extreme in either paying or reporting this income to all the jurisdictions involved, but when calculating ROI or other things upon which a business is based, it's a little disingenuous to claim ""making"" $10,000 when in fact, that number is far less. But I get it, $10,000 makes for a nice headline.",1343757754

4318715,comment,4318042,4318042,2,0,spaghetti,,,"The article reminded me of a thought I had regarding FB's monetization strategy: strictly local advertisements. The ad matching algorithm would place the most weight on geographical distance then interests etc. FB's ubiquitous nature today could make this work.<p>Here's a use case that motivated the idea: I live in a densely populated area where everyone around me has a car. Say I wake up to a flat tire. I'd much rather pay someone $20 to just fix it in 10 minutes than get the car towed or figure out how to do it myself. Imagine searching for ""fix spare tire"" on Facebook and receiving search results for five people that all live with-in two blocks. Choose a person, agree to pay with cash, they show up and fix the tire.<p>The service FB provides in this example has real value. If this service existed I'd actually use Facebook, take a good look at the ads and perhaps even pay a small monthly fee.<p>To use an over-used term I see this as ""the Airbnb of everything else"". It could be applied to simple plumbing tasks like fixing the toilet (which was a real pain-in-the-ass to figure out). It could even apply to borrowing vacuum cleaners! The point is there's under-utilized resources around people. Imagine FB helping people utilize these resources like Airbnb helps people utilize extra living space.",1343757731

(/exaggeration).<p>cfinke should've just gotten someone who knows about pianos to help him/her choose a good one, the way you might with a used car (although the choice is more subtle and less statistics-based).<p>As a counter example, I practice every day for hours on a baby grand piano from the 1930's which is very sturdy, with a beautiful tone. It was sitting unused (and untuned!) for decades in an old woman's house.<p>It was purchased for 1,000 euros at an auction, one of only two bidders.<p>I had it tuned by someone: it still sounded problematic, but good for practicing. I had a different tuner come and he made it sound incredibly good after a single tuning.<p>So the technician makes a huge difference too.<p>Piano restoration is fascinating, but engineers tend to underestimate how important trained hearing is in in order to improve the sound.<p>(rather than just being able to make a piano function properly on a mechanical level).",1343757679

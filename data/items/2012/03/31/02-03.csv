The browser can not (and should not) attempt to identify the ""evil"" HTTP requests from the ""good"" ones. The browser's job is to make requests.<p>Now, you could argue the browser's job should be to implement security features as well. It does, after all, implement the same-origin policy. But, if you think about it, there is no good way for the browser to fix the CSRF issue. You can ask the user, which is what's suggested, but that never really works. They'll do one of two things: click ""okay"" <i>every single time</i>, or stop using your browser.<p>I would guess well over half of all websites do one of the following: (1) load an external JS file, (2) load an external image, (3) load an external CSS file, (4) use an iframe which points to a different origin, (5) use a JS redirect, (6) use a meta redirect, or (7) open a new window.<p>The proposed ""solution"" to CSRF stops ALL of these use cases. The user would have to manually approve each and every one of them. Given that well under 1% of alerts would be true attacks, the user would almost definitely ""okay"" on the attacks as well: they would have been trained by thousands of other alerts that this is an acceptable thing to do.<p>There was a paper by Barth and Jackson on CSRF defenses where they propose an Origin header, but that's the extent to which security is implemented in the browser. It is fundamentally up to the web application for verifying the user did in fact initiate the request. No amount of code in the web browser can get around this fact.",1333162037

And, honestly, you just get used to it.  You take it into account, everyone else takes it into account, that's how it is.<p>The sprawl isn't as much of a factor as some might imagine.  You tend to stay within 10-15 miles of home anyway, so it doesn't matter that there's another 50-60 miles of sprawl beyond that.  Besides, it's not like SV is sprawl-free.<p>LA is much bigger than SF, and that's mostly a benefit.  More options for most everything.<p>As far as dating, just avoid anyone in any way connected to entertainment and it's fine.  I'm sort of kidding.  Sort of not.<p>It's cheaper than SV, for sure. Though the upper end can compete with the upper end of SF as well.  It's a city where you can spend as much as you'd like, there's not really a ceiling.<p>Los Angeles gets a bad rap culturally, but in reality it's second only to New York in just about any cultural way you'd care to name. There's a LOT of creative people here in just about every creative arena.<p>One thing I really like about LA is that there's probably more people trying to live their wildest dreams than anywhere else on earth.  I think that's admirable.<p>Biggest downside?  Weather.  I hate the lack of rain.  Something I hear a lot from people who are from elsewhere.  Summers are quite tedious.",1333160580

What, you didnt hear about that?  Nobody did.<p>The extent of damage is only just now coming to light in the form of millions of false 2011 income tax returns filed in the names of people currently receiving Social Security benefits. That includes a very large number of elderly and disabled people who are ill-equipped to recognize or fight the problem. Its an impact pervasive enough that the IRS now has a form just to deal with it: Form 14039: Identity Theft Affidavit, December 2011.<p>The Wall $treet Journal has a story about this problem specific to Puerto Rico, but the Journal fails to mention that this is a national problem  a $30+ billion problem.<p>The story is going public now because tax season is upon us and theres no way to keep it under wraps as people file their tax returns only to learn that a return under that name has already been filed with refunds paid electronically into a bank account now closed. The December date on that IRS Form 14039 shows the Treasury has been expecting this for awhile.<p>The question being asked about this in Washington, DC today is whether this hack was an act of war? More likely an act of Tony Soprano, Id say. If the goal of war is to sow confusion and discontent, then okay, maybe China or Iran are behind this (you dont have to be a superpower to take on the U.S. government anymore). But the more probable goal is simply to steal money and thats a domestic job.<p>Either way, that big hacker score guys like me have been predicting for several years has finally happened with draconian policy changes sure to follow.

3779060,comment,3775400,3778190,1,0,kamaal,,,"The problem really isn't with a particular component in Java. The problem with Java is, Java came as a quick relief to people who had problems with managing memory themselves. Java solved what seemed to be the most pressing problem at that time. Times have changed, today I have completely forgotten some thing called as 'memory management by programmer', today its a given that a modern language today should do that by default.<p>The problem with Java today is how big and bloated it has become while it doesn't solve fundamental problems programmers face. Its growingly becoming impossible to program in Java without an IDE. Only Java ninjas can probably program Java with a Text editor. Its XML mess all over the place.<p>Now it takes several tens of lines of code to do trivial file operations and other trivial tasks. This problem was long solved with languages like Perl and Python around 20 years back. Its almost two decades and Java still hasn't caught up. There are still no practical lambdas and good functional programming capabilities.<p>The issue is something like this. By asking everything to become an API of some sort and writing so many method calls both my unit tests and exception handling code bloats like crazy. My eyes cringe every time I open a Java class file and nearly 60% of the code in there is either try/catch statements or some form get/set methods.<p>The code to boilerplate ratio is too high. And it just doesn't feel like a language that belongs to the 2010's. Java and its community also promotes heavy use of XML's often used as bad replacements for RDBMS, this leads to building of small buggy and wrongly built DSL equivalents of small parts of SQL all the time.<p>The path from now is not the make the language bloat like crazy and then provide IDE's to handle that. It is to make the language syntax intelligent enough to take care of many problems you have to other wise worry about. If you see the whole concept of Lisp and other extensible languages like Perl are all about. To provide forms of extensibility that solve the code scalability problem.<p>And lastly and unfortunately the Java market is full of substandard programmers whose life begins and ends inside eclipse.<p>A manager or a pointy haired boss might prefer Java for hiring cheap programmers and the 'Oracle factor'. But Java is dead for Start up's and other sexy glorious projects.",1333159455

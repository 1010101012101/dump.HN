166168,comment,165471,165606,0,0,thwarted,,,"I just had a conversation with someone today about adding editorial content to a site.  There is no content to post yet, but it's time to get cracking on writing the code to display it!  As if writing the code is the hardest part of this.  If we wanted it to take 15 minutes, we could install wordpress and be done: but it would be an empty site without all the other non-programming ""business"" things that need to be done before one can actually say they have a blog, ahem, editorial section.",1208418427

166160,comment,166012,166012,0,0,bokonist,,,"The real culprit is credentialism.<p>In the 1800's, a high school drop out could architect the New York Public library.  Abe Lincoln became a lawyer by reading in his spare time and passing the bar exam.  Today, the law requires you to have 7 years of college to practice either occupation.<p>Why did this happen?  As far as I know it was not because buildings were falling down left and right.  The most likely answer is that people who work an occupation want to erect barriers to entry, thus forcing up their own wages.  The policy has a ratchet effect, as a large interest group is now created of people who are dependent on those barriers.  Thus the policy is extremely difficult to roll back.<p>If we really want to open career doors for the most people possible at the lowest cost, we should eliminate legal schooling requirements for all occupations.  Then we can return to the 19th century apprenticeship system, which was completely free and gave better career preparation.",1208417915

166157,comment,165855,166155,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I understand that some of Digg's changes relate to this second concern. Their issues (I'll admit to limited understanding, so feel free to correct me somebody) relate to their rating algorithm being linked to how 'popular' a contributer is. This naturally weights power users more and pushes their contributions to the front, where they get more views, more votes, and therefore more power.<p>My (similarly limited) understanding of the HN ranking system is that it's more a factor of time and votes - ie, the question of who contributed is not relevant to the ranking system, only to all of us users who decide which articles to read and vote on, which brings us back to the original question.",1208416944
166156,comment,165896,165896,0,0,sdurkin,,,"Very funny anecdote. What bothers me though is that this implies that Google seems to think they own the web.<p>For example, they told the guy that he was lucky that they were willing to give him a backup, but it seems to me that Google's the one that should be taking responsibility for their actions.<p>Its a short jump from, ""you have to use POST or we'll delete your stuff"" to ""you have to follow Google standard X or we won't index your site.""<p>Welcome to the first web empire.",1208416638
166155,comment,165855,166024,0,0,coderrr,,,"I think you raise an interesting point.  There are actually TWO problems here.  One is that there is possibly a bias based on the content submitter/creator.<p>But the other is that, people who are followed will naturally get more votes, just because they get more views.  Is that a bad thing?  I dunno.  But what if it got to a point where there were enough different people being followed that the only way onto the first page is by being one of them.  That kindof sounds like a problem too.",1208416479

If you have money, NYC is a blast.  Maybe they can work a pet project from there.<p>I'd say, if you have more than 3-4 millions on your bank account, you are really well off, and the only thing that prevents from finding a woman, is your character, or lack of trying.<p>Bad looks, can be fixed with some good fashion, exercise, and maybe some litle surgery.",1208416327

166150,comment,165855,166133,0,0,rms,,,"OK, yes, it is possible as long as the other account never answers meta questions about this site or YC, and all meta-questions are eliminated in the comparison. It's still not worth doing, because there is a pg bias: people follow his comments and submissions and are more likely to vote them up because they are more likely to see them.",1208416096
166149,comment,165276,165419,0,0,pg,,,"YC wasn't copied from the Summer of Code.  We weren't really aware how that worked.  What it was copied from, initially, was the classic college student summer job at a software co.  The idea was basically to let people get a summer job starting a startup.<p>Later we tossed some aspects of that (going back to school in the fall doesn't work well with startups), but kept others, like the 3-month cycle.",1208415966
166148,comment,165855,166048,0,0,coderrr,,,"This is true.  It's a heuristic our brain uses so it doesn't have to reevaluate things every single time we experience them.  Whether or not this is good or bad is very debatable and depends on the context.<p>The heuristic is something we evolved through evolution to help us make choices quickly and survive better.  For example we know to just trust whatever the group leader says when there is danger rather than having an open debate every time he speaks because that could get us killed.<p>In the case of HN, does it matter if we have to fully evaluate the content every time before we vote (w/o knowing who wrote it)?  I don't know.  I think there are probably cases on HN where that heuristic is still to our benefit.  I don't think theres black or white here, the costs on both sides just need to be weighed...<p>Also I think everyone should realize there is a small parallel with the ad hominem attck which is DH1 from PG's post about how to disagree with people (<a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html</a>).  In this case it's exactly the opposite, vote up because of who it is instead of based on the merit, as opposed to vote down (or attack) based on who it is as instead of based on merit.",1208415900

The point of the article is that the author thinks it'll fuel growth, even without any evidence that that's true.<p>I know from personal experience that just having a site in x language does not make it popular in x's country of origin. OkCupid has been doing the ""users translate the site"" idea for a while now, and still has to put in work beyond that to promote the site beyond the US.",1208415795

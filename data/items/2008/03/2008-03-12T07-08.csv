134997,comment,134380,134620,0,0,delackner,,,"My own understanding of derivatives is very weak, but could someone extend this example to explain what the resulting state would be in this chain?  Simplifying a little, a->b->c->a (a loop), where -> is ""owes $1000"".  So party A dies, leaving B in the hole, right?  This seems like a recipe for massive implosion, an unstable system ala a mountain of sand.  Destabilize one grain, somewhere, and you get an avalanche.",1205308396

134995,comment,134918,134918,0,0,jackdied,,,"1) Yes, this doesn't belong on YC<p>2) Superdelegates are supposed to make the kind of calculations you are suggesting.  They have a big advantage in that they vote last so they know the most up-to-date breakdowns of the individual states.  Superdelegates are immune to the cross-party registration (Rep voting in Dem primary) and are more likely to listen to actuarial opinion - you could provide the same info to the voting public but it wouldn't change votes much.  That's the theory of Superdelegates anyway.",1205308321

134981,comment,134918,134918,0,0,neilk,,,"The primary is not a sampling to determine the most popular candidate for a general election. It is a method for a party to determine its chosen representative. Also, the rules differ from state to state about which kind of voters can vote in the primary -- in some, you have to be a ""registered"" member, in others not. So your method would never apply generally.<p>I find the American system baffling because consults the public so early in the process. In parliamentary systems, the party chooses a leader, and then this leader becomes the face of the party in the next election. In other words, there is only ""superdelegates"". That seems way more rational to me, although it sets a higher bar for insurgent candidates.",1205305553

There are plenty of excellent American robotics engineers available, but there are even more European, Australian, Japanese, Chinese, etc, who love their lifestyles and would rather work on something slightly less interesting to not have to move. The first hardware/software company that works out how to effectively handle remote teams and prototype hardware is going to dramatically increase their available pool of skilled workers.

Go a little further and you have hidden item games, runners, etc.<p>The only reason it&#x27;s so obvious with games like Flappy Bird and 2048 is that the mechanic is so simple and requires so little in terms of effort and resources that anyone with even an elementary skill set on a mobile platform can throw together one of these clones and puke it onto the internet to ride the wave (or at least the foam, as most of them never even get into the surf).",1395701975

If today Brendan says he will pick No Opinion to &quot;Should Bills of Rights be included in the Constitution of the United States&quot;, then should he be held accountable for his decision?<p>He can either support Bills of Rights, against Bills of Rights, or he can do nothing about it, in which case is pretty much in the same camp as the opposition. The only difference is he chose to not care and yet he will probably be judged for not helping human rights. And human rights, to many is a worthwhile ethic cause. Not an individual morality debate; just as gay advocates would think gay rights is a basic right of human. If Brendan chose to say &quot;I have no opinion&quot; he is neither against nor supporting gay rights but his decision will disappoint the gay advocates in which case the advocates will not be happy with Mozilla.

7462284,comment,7461210,7461915,5,0,rjknight,,,"I&#x27;m a vaguely left-libertarian-ish person, so my view on gay marriage is that I cannot see a reason why it should not be allowed and, beyond that, it&#x27;s pretty much none of my business.  But I do find it difficult to draw a line at which marriage should <i>not</i> be allowed.  People like to raise the issue of polygamy, and I can&#x27;t honestly think of a good reason why polygamous marriage shouldn&#x27;t be allowed either.  The examples after that get more troublesome: should a man be allowed to marry his own daughter?  How about siblings marrying each other?  In the realms of absurdity, we might consider marriage to non-humans, to dead people, to inanimate objects or to imaginary beings (and, since this is HN, we should probably give serious thought to people marrying their devices, or at least the AIs that may inhabit them in the future).<p>Part of me doesn&#x27;t really care - I have no particular interest in &quot;protecting the sanctity of marriage&quot; because I think that personal relationships are personal and don&#x27;t require anyone else&#x27;s validation.  But I can&#x27;t imagine that society as a whole would agree with me on that.  For better or worse, we need some way of delineating what is considered to be <i>acceptable</i> marriage and what isn&#x27;t, and this is largely an arbitrary choice.  You can probably ground it in the notion of consent, which would rule out marriage to dead people, imaginary beings, non-humans (that we&#x27;ve encountered so far) and inanimate objects.  It would still leave polygamous and incestuous marriage open, but maybe that&#x27;s OK (and rare enough that nobody really needs to care).<p>So, as a disinterested party I can kinda see where the anti-gay-marriage people are coming from, in an anthropological observation sense - they&#x27;re aware that an arbitrary choice must be made somewhere, they&#x27;ve made their choice and they don&#x27;t see why they should change.  If you <i>truly</i> believe that marriage is something that can only happen between a man and a woman, that it&#x27;s sanctified by tradition and some ineffable spiritual wisdom, then you won&#x27;t think of yourself as denying homosexual couples the right to marry.  You&#x27;ll be utterly perplexed by the fact that they <i>want</i> to - you&#x27;d see it as a doomed enterprise, people pretending to be what they cannot.  The thing is, this has really nothing to do with what you think of homosexual people in general, you just believe that they can&#x27;t marry, in much the same sense that they can&#x27;t fly, shape-shift or shoot lightning from their fingertips.  It just doesn&#x27;t work!  Weirdly, civil partnerships can still make perfect sense because there&#x27;s an obvious reason for them to exist (people can still love each other and spend their lives together even if they&#x27;re not, or can&#x27;t become, married).<p>I&#x27;m probably being overly-charitable here.  Some anti-gay-marriage people are probably homophobic bigots who just enjoy telling people what to do and punishing those who aren&#x27;t exactly like them.  Even the ones who have some internally-consistent reasoning behind their position and don&#x27;t otherwise dislike or discriminate against gay people can be faulted for their sheer lack of empathy.  In the end there is no point in trying to argue the specifics because everything hinges on whether you believe marriage between two people of the same sex is a legitimate concept.  I&#x27;m a little bit ambivalent about this, because I don&#x27;t really see a reason why there couldn&#x27;t be some special club for straight people who want to commit to each other, and traditionally that&#x27;s what marriage has been.  I suspect, however, that there will be no great call for such an institution to be created, now that &quot;marriage&quot; is open to everyone.<p>Now, on the actual matter-in-hand, I don&#x27;t think Brendan Eich deserves to be vilified.  Not because I think he&#x27;s right about gay marriage (I don&#x27;t), but because I believe that people are entitled to think and act how they like when in private, and they should conversely be held to rigorous standards in their public conduct.  We&#x27;re all adults and we&#x27;re all capable of putting our private beliefs aside when conducting a public role.  The fact that Eich&#x27;s views are public should actually make it <i>easier</i> to hold him to account for his public actions as Mozilla CEO.  Debates about gay marriage are good for our society, but it&#x27;s the debate about the <i>issues</i> that is healthy, not the attacks on particular individuals.<p>I must admit that his stance makes me think less of him as a person.  But it doesn&#x27;t really make me think less of him as a technologist, advocate for Mozilla, or CEO.  If he uses his position to advance an exclusionary political agenda then I would think very much less of him as a CEO, and that&#x27;s where the distinction between private beliefs and public actions is relevant for me.",1395701231

No SIPC coverage for customer funds and no SEC registration. This is a bigger problem for Derivabit than Mt Gox. First, it appears they are U.S.-based. Second, derivatives are closer to the U.S. definition of securities than crypto-currencies.<p>(2) Underlying price determination. I see the current spot price as $587. Where is this coming from?  American options are continuous-time derivatives. These are sensitive to price information disruptions. Perhaps consider European or binary options?<p>(3) No rates or collateral markets. Options market makers need rates and collateral markets to provide liquidity and correct market aberrations through arbitrage. Rates markets are venues where one can borrow and lend capital, in BTC or U.S. dollars, to conduct Bitcoin market activity. Collateral markets are venues where one can borrow and lend Bitcoins. Non-linear derivatives market participates need collateral markets to manage their risks. Without collateral markets, volatilises for puts and calls will diverge and the market&#x27;s robustness will suffer. The lack of rates and collateral markets also makes this market vulnerable to some well-known predatory trading tactics.<p>(4) Counterparty risk. U.S. exchange-traded equity options are centrally cleared through the Options Clearing Corporation (the &quot;OCC&quot;). Whether the writer of a contact pays up is irrelevant to the buyer - the OCC always pays everyone. Several layers of reserves and guarantees enhance the creditworthiness of the OCC. Counterparty credit is likely a greater risk than volatility for a Derivabit contract.",1395700152

My intended point was only that generally socialist-leaning countries usually need to have something to balance that inclination or over time things tend to start going wrong.<p>In successful examples, such as we see in Scandinavia, competent government and generally good public services appear to be sufficient. People see a decent return on the relatively high levels of taxation they pay. Also, while the overall tax burden is relatively high, most of these countries tend to have a relatively soft touch with businesses that makes them nevertheless a reasonably attractive place to operate.<p>In less successful examples, such as we saw in Greece, the same sentiment is present, but the government failed to actually collect the taxes and provide effective public services. Black markets and corruption were everywhere, and a vicious cycle set in, leading to excessive borrowing by the government and the end result we&#x27;re all familiar with. I&#x27;d suggest that similar factors were at work in Italy, with so much corruption and general incompetence in the government that they essentially gave up on democracy and wound up with an appointed technocrat at the helm. Portugal, also, had some very dubious financial management at government level, much of it based on excessive employment in the public sector and dubious arrangements based on public-private partnerships, and of course the problems with the banks that led up to their economic crisis.<p>I concede that perhaps it wasn&#x27;t correct to identify the PIIGS as a group in this context, because not all of their recent economic troubles started the same way. Even so, several of them have shared striking similarities, both in being generally over-reliant on an inefficient public sector before the crisis and in being relatively difficult places to try and start a new business since then.",1395699780

(Note: I&#x27;m talking about general/recreational aviation here). dchichkov mentioned the Antares, which is a high-performance electric self-launch sailplane. In this category, there&#x27;s also the Pipistrel Taurus G4. Lots of other electrically-powered light aircraft exist, and they are all held back by battery weight, volume and cost.<p>There is a large number of advantages to electric propulsion vs. combustion engines in aircraft: Much lower maintenance costs, simpler maintenance, higher reliability (in gliders, replacing two-stroke engines with electric motors yields a huge safety advantage), lower fuel cost, simpler operation (less possibility for human error), less noise, lower weight (ex batteries), smaller volume per unit power, higher efficiency, lower purchase cost. The only real disadvantages are low energy density and charging time/infrastructure. At some point in the medium-term future (~5 years) we will hit a point where the benefits obviously outweigh the disadvantages for many use cases. In fact, I think the inflection point has already been hit wrt. the battery tech, it&#x27;s just that it isn&#x27;t obvious to anyone who isn&#x27;t intimately familiar with the progress in battery pack cost development. Give it a couple of years.<p>Even this list of advantages disregards the fact that the mechanical simplicity of electric motors enable aircraft configurations that haven&#x27;t been tried at scale, for instance gimballed/swerving variable-geometry ducted-fan propellers, etc. Electric motors are also not dependent on high air pressure to get enough oxygen for efficient combustion. There&#x27;s just a huge new design space that opens up when you have sufficiently powerful battery storage.

It has very different characteristics from exchange-traded options contracts that you may be familiar with in the US. Purchasing call options is pretty safe (excluding security risks, of course), but purchasing put options is quite dangerous. They have a margin requirement of 20% on put options that are written by users, but critically, this is the maximum amount of liability the put writer is taking on. So it&#x27;s actually not a put you are buying, but a &quot;bear put spread&quot; with a lower leg 20% below the upper leg. This makes it unsuitable for managing tail risk, which, for bitcoins, is significant. For example, if you had bought a contract at $1100 which is roughly the top of the bitcoin market in December, and it fell to $600, you would only be covered for $220, and would be out $280 plus the cost of the contract (Edit: apparently this isn&#x27;t correct, in another comment they say that you get the cost of the contract back).<p>The fact that they require 100% margin on call options isn&#x27;t as much of a concern (for simple risk management applications), because you still gain the exposure to the underlying bitcoins. It would be like if the exchange required you to submit 100 shares of MSFT to them to open the call contract, rather than using cash settlement. It&#x27;s not good for liquidity because it makes it hard to be an options trader, but there will be very little liquidity anyway the way it&#x27;s set up currently.<p>Another concern is that the guide doesn&#x27;t disclose what they use as the underlying price for the contract, what exchange they use as the benchmark.<p>It should also be noted that they appear to require photo id in order to withdraw any funds from your wallet, which is likewise not disclosed in their guide.",1395698401

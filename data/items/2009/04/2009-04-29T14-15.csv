Go to a research library where you can read and copy paid industry and market research reports for free (the library pays the fees.)  Bring a USB key and you can download the reports (at least in SIBL in NYC.)<p>I would suggest you do some old fashioned market research by looking at the age/sex/demographics/industry of your target customers and reading market research reports on them and industry reports on your competitors and other replacement products.  A replacement product is one that isn't a direct competitor but people can use instead of your product (for example: Gmail and Google calendar is not a direct competitor of a CRM system like Salesforce.com, but people can and do use it instead of a CRM system.)<p>I think you could do all of this with 1 day spent in the library.  You can find the same information on the internet, but it will take you a lot longer and you would have to pay for many of the same reports you could get from the research library for free.",1241016759

I dislike meeting <i>new</i> people a bit, and since ""networking"" involves meeting as many new people as possible, it's basically a shorthand for the part of social interaction I dislike. :)  I'm not ""extremely"" introverted or anything; it's just that going through recruiters has seemed to be a more pleasant avenue than meeting dozens or hundreds of new people over the same period.<p>We disagree about pretending, too.  Pretending is the quickest way to changing your personality, distasteful as it is in the short term.  Want to be more optimistic, happier, more outgoing?  Start acting as though you are right now, and you'll move in that direction.  Pretending is 80% of social interaction, too, as far as I can see.  ""Hey, how are you, today?"" is, in the vast majority of cases, a pretense of being actually interested in my day.  If you want to find out how many people are pretending, answer in detail rather than just saying ""Great!"" or some such answer.  I sometimes answer in detail, anyway, because I forget that virtually everyone else is pretending (or because I'm not paying enough attention to consciously respond correctly), rather than interested, and this almost always ends awkwardly. :)",1241016718

Even if the ratio were 1-in-20, it would still be better for me and people like me to use recruiters.  To be clear, ""people like me"" here refers to those of us who strongly dislike networking, gladhanding, and basically pretending to be interested in people we know nothing about except that they might be able to help us get a job at some point.  While it's not nearly so strong as my dislike of meeting new people, my aversion even to interacting with people I already know is strong enough that I regularly fail to keep in touch with family and close friends for months or years at a time.

However, Verizon itself has said that Apple has no interest in making a non-GSM phone.  I'm guessing, as the article postulates, that these negotiations are a way of milking AT&T for more money.  Verizon is rolling out an LTE network which Apple will probably provide a device for, but that network won't be finished until 2014 according to the latest reports.<p>However, these negotiations could get a lot more money out of AT&T who desperately would like to keep the iPhone as an exclusive past 2010.<p>As for the iPhone losing its ""special-ness"" when it becomes multi-carrier like the Motorola RAZR, that's a different situation.  The RAZR was a basically unchanged phone for years.  It was hot when it came out because it was new and different, but other phones became even better than it as Motorola rested on its laurels.  Apple has a few advantages here.  First, they've shown with their iPod line that they won't be content selling the same, unimproved product when they could be making improvements.  Second, one of the most attractive things about the iPhone right now is the App Store.<p>The App Store has put a huge barrier up against competition.  Sure, there are a million-odd Android phones out there, but there are nearly 40M iPhone/iPod touches out there - and, in terms of developer mindset, the iPhone is where it's at.  In fact, the iPhone is starting to look like Windows in that developer mindset is firmly behind the iPhone and alternative platforms aren't seeing the cool applications coming out for them.  Apple's now in the position where third parties are creating the value of their platform by developing for it.  I'm not saying that's a good thing (as someone who will shortly own a Palm Pre), but it does look like I'll be stuck without many of the cool apps.",1241013616

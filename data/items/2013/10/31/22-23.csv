However a lot of these tech companies are American and for them to all breach the gag order at once would have a large impact on the already struggling economy. Could they not use this potential economic disaster as a get out of jail token?<p>I mean it&#x27;s kinda what the banks did with the too big to fail stuff. Putting a lot of companies in jeopardy at once could force the government to not act on prosecuting them.<p>I could also be talking out of my butt.",1383260396

Even if you require persistance, since the intentionally small dataset means you can get away quite well with raw memory dumps or even an mmap variant.  You wouldn&#x27;t use a full-fledged JSON serializer but a limited string concatenation.<p>In any case, the way I read it, the requirement doesn&#x27;t mean you have to make anything particularly heavy, just that you need to use a representation that&#x27;s general enough to be usable in other scenarios without rewriting the entire app.<p>Of course, a little bit of extra encouragement in the form of a benchmark that&#x27;s slightly harder to game wouldn&#x27;t be bad.",1383260331

Besides living in Seattle (2 yrs) I&#x27;ve also lived in San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Waterloo, and London (Ontario, not the cool one).<p>I&#x27;ve seen a <i>lot</i> worse than what happens in downtown Seattle, and yeah, SF has it a lot worse. <i>A lot</i> worse.<p>I also have an intense dislike for the urban one-upsmanship that seems uniquely American in my experience. As if having seen/lived through worse crime is a badge of honor, and that people living/working in elevated crime areas (just <i>less</i> elevated than some other places) should just suck it up. SF is the absolute worst in this regard (far worse than Seattle), where any criticism about the state of poverty and crime in the city elicits a &quot;hurrr go back to the midwest then hurrrr&quot;.<p>A spade is a spade, even if there are bigger spades out there. The fact that Seattle&#x27;s urban planning cockups are less severe than San Francisco&#x27;s should come only as a very mild, very cold comfort.<p>Part of Seattle&#x27;s problem - one that I touched on but didn&#x27;t expand on earlier - is that it feels less safe than it actually is. When it comes to quality of life though, perception of safety is equally important as actual safety. The vast stretches of nothingness at night presents a huge perception problem that I don&#x27;t think can be conquered by simply telling people &quot;yeah, that nearly empty street with no businesses and a lot aggressive panhandlers making catcalls at you isn&#x27;t so bad, statistically your odds are good!&quot;.<p>Seattle isn&#x27;t that dangerous of a city - I made that clear earlier. The downtown is mildly sketchy, the homelessness problem is acute but not as bad as some other places, but the complete void that fills downtown after work is a huge problem that prevents any major progress on this front.<p>By the way, Seattle <i>is</i> a pedestrian ghost town. Even Pioneer Square on a busy night is ghostly compared to every other urban core in North America I&#x27;ve ever been to. Downtown Seattle (qualified as Olive/Pine all the way down to Yesler or Jackson, and west of I-5) is completely f&#x27;ing deserted at night.",1383258322

Century link is also up there with a plan for a whopping 7mbps of speed down and less than 1mbps up.  Comcast offers a plan for 50mbps down and 10mbps up, I need more upload speed, but I can make do with an upload running for hours a day.  This wouldn&#x27;t be bad if Comcast actually worked, but it doesn&#x27;t.  Probably 2 or 3 nights a week my internet becomes near unusable during peak times, I resort to putting my cell phone on LTE and seeing what I need to that way, I can&#x27;t even keep up with the buffer rate on the lowest quality Youtube videos.<p>Downtown though, there are a number of apartment and condo buildings that offer 100mbps up & down internet for $60 a month (compared to my $75 for Comcast), or 1gigabit up and down for $120 a month(not available from Comcast at all).  So, we do have <i>some</i> gigabit internet, and I&#x27;ve actually found a few places I&#x27;d consider living and likely will affect my decision when I eventually move.<p>At least in my neighborhood, Comcast has terrible(often broken) service with absolutely no alternative.  I suppose maybe the density of Queen Anne can&#x27;t justify the cost of gigabit fiber to the top of the hill, but given how many Microsoft and Amazon people live up here I&#x27;d be shocked if there weren&#x27;t huge interest.

6650317,comment,6648206,6648206,13,0,tptacek,,,"My bet: the most important bit of advice you could give any startup about managing acquisition offers is: <i>assume the offer is going to fall through</i>. Funding negotiations are something many startups have a lot of experience with, and they&#x27;re notorious for unraveling late in the game. Acquisition talks are much worse: they take longer and are more likely to fall apart.<p>An acquisition negotiation that dies late in the game is especially demoralizing. When you&#x27;re getting a company funded, you&#x27;re talking to lots of different investors, and may even have multiple paths to fund the company (institutional VC, a convertible debt round, &c). But failing to close an acquisition feels more like a verdict about the company and its prospects. For one thing, you have fewer potential acquirers than investors. For another, to get even a little bit engaged in an acquisition talk, you have to get yourself in the mindset of a near-future exit.<p>Things to watch out for:<p>* The (usually inadvertent) management shift from sales to &quot;business development&quot;, where you start bouncing around the industry talking to different people about acquisitions<p>* Acquirer optionality --- the article correctly points out that the acquiring <i>firm</i> isn&#x27;t necessarily prioritizing lower valuation about all else, but remember that deals are usually instigated and closed by specific <i>people</i> in the firm, whose careers are most definitely going to be evaluated by the perceived success of the purchase --- long story short, the bizdev guy at your potential acquirer is likely to keep you on the hook longer than you&#x27;ll be comfortable.<p>* Infecting your team. I&#x27;m actually not sure it&#x27;s all that standard for acquirers to do rolling team interviews. I&#x27;ve been a part of a couple (and a party to a couple more) now and haven&#x27;t been formally interviewed despite very senior roles. I&#x27;d be wary of letting an acquirer &quot;interview&quot; anyone on my team before I was reasonable sure the deal will close.<p>The other thing to know about acquisitions is that they are <i>fucking expensive</i>. If you haven&#x27;t done one, you probably have no idea. You are going to get very, very friendly with corporate attorneys, and if you&#x27;ve got counsel now reviewing sales contracts and whatnot, be aware that the attorneys that manage your warrants and reps and stuff are way way more expensive than those contract review people are.<p>The good news about legal expense and team risk is that they can be used as deal qualifiers: if an acquirer balks about committing to something before interviewing the team, or about legal costs, the deal might not be there. If it isn&#x27;t, it&#x27;s important that you know that!",1383257035

IIRC, courts still cannot compel one to disclose the combination to unlock a safe, only to provide a key to a lock, exactly because safe combinations exist solely within the defendant&#x27;s mind--just like most encryption keys. Disclosing the key implies that one has access to the data, which may be incriminating in and of itself with certain data. Even if the key is not provided, and the defendant is allowed to enter their password privately so that prosecutors may inspect the unencrypted data, the act of entering the password in and of itself provides evidence that one is aware of the contents, and thus may be used as evidence against oneself.",1383256901

Thanks for confirming that you consider Comcast one though.<p>> even though time and time again government does a piss-poor job when given control.<p>You are correct there, the government&#x27;s control over internet service has enabled a few mammoth carriers to become monopoly&#x27;s of their realm. Be it for &#x27;national security&#x27; interests like AT&T or be it piles of lobbyist money from Comcast.<p>The end result is no competition amongst peers. The only thing coming close would be companies that lease off of Comcast trying to sell packages at a lower cost. This of course doesn&#x27;t last long since AT&T Comcast and others worked out exactly how to kill leased operators at will subsidizing rates in areas leasers operate to remove any profit potential from the competition that was forced to buy from Comcast anyways.<p>But complain about an operator that doesn&#x27;t exist yet like it is a monopoly. Blame them for things they have not done yet. Try to push forward the fantasy that Comcast has a quality of service beyond destroying other quality services.",1383256879

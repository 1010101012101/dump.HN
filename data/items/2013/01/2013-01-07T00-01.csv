This effectively means the subscriber must have a set-top box or CableCard, to decrypt whatever content scrambling system the provider uses (e.g. Motorola's DigiCipher II) between the head-end and the set-top. Also, with a set-top box or CableCard, they can set the 5C flag for the FireWire port to prevent the recording of the content with a DVD recorder and can mandate HDCP protection for HDMI. [Of course, there are still HDCP strippers and the analog hole, so if somebody wants to cap their content, everybody knows this isn't going to stop them.]",1357520367

5018587,comment,5007674,5015488,2,0,Yttrill,,,"One needs closures, that is, functional values bound to some context, for higher order functions (HOFs). For example in C++ much of STL was pretty useless until C++11 added lambdas. Many systems provide for closures in C, by requiring you register callbacks as event handlers, and these callbacks invariably have an associated client data pointer. A C callback function together with a pointer to arbitrary client data object is a hand constructed closure.<p>The utility of closures derives from being able to split a data context into two pieces and program the two halves separately and independently. For example for many data structures you can write a visitor function which accepts a closure which is called with each visited value. Lets say we have N data structures.<p>Independently you can write different calculations on those values formed incrementally one value at a time, such as addition, or, multiplication. Lets say we have M operations.<p>With now you can perform N * M distinct calculations whilst only writing N + M functions. You have achieved this because both halves of the computation are functions: lambda abstraction reduces a quadratic problem to a linear one.<p>The downside of this is that the abstraction gets in the way of the compiler re-combining the visitor HOF and the calculation function to generate more efficient code.<p>There's another more serious structural problem though. The client of a HOF is a callback. In C, this is very lame because functions have no state. In more advanced languages they can have state. That's an improvement but it isn't good enough because it's still a callback, and callbacks are unusable for anything complex.<p>A callback is a slave. The HOF that calls it is a master. Even if the context of the slave is a finite state machine, where there is theory which tells you how to maintain the state, doing so is very hard. What you really want is for the calculation part of the problem to be a master, just like the HOF itself is. You want your calculation to read its data, and maintain state in the first instance on the stack.<p>Many people do not believe this and answer that they have no problems with callbacks, but these people are very ignorant. Just you try to write a simple program that is called with data from a file instead of reading the file. An operating system is just one big HOF that calls back into your program with stream data, but there's an important difference: both your program and the operating system are masters: your program reads the data, it isn't a function that accepts the data as an argument.<p>Another common example of master/master programming is client/server paradigm. This is usually implemented with two threads or processes and a communication link.<p>Felix special ability is high performance control inversion. It allows you to write threads which read data, and translates them into callbacks mechanically.<p>Some programming languages can do this in a limited context. For example Python has iterators and you can write functions that yield without losing their context, but this only works in the special case of a sequential visitor.<p>Felix can do this in general. It was actually designed to support monitoring half a million phone calls with threads that could perform complex calculations such as minimal cost routing. At the time no OS could come close to launching that number of pre-emptive threads yet Felix could do the job on a 1990's desktop PC (with a transaction rate around 500K/sec where a transaction was either a thread creation or sending a null message).",1357520221

The test was a negative effect because we forced people to stop using search, which was the feature we were experimenting with. Making buying less efficient, even if people want to buy so much that they eventually succeed, isn't a great result.<p>> And they are probably not using search as much because browsing is much nicer with infinite scroll.<p>No for two reasons. First, browse pages didn't have infinite scroll back when this test was done. And second, the point is that people seeing infinite scroll purchased less from search <i>as compared to the control.</i> This was a controlled A/B test.<p>As gfodor says, yes the back button did return you to your place (or it did, once we ironed out all of the problems with it in early incarnations).",1357520053

This market sells ~350M units a year with a total installed base of 1.25 BILLION, yet unit sales are declining, desktop Linux is doing nothing to change this, and Blizzard's flagship title is in decline.<p>The Linux PC cannot go lower than $300-$400 despite essentially $0 licensing costs because virtually nobody is selling or buying raw Linux PC hardware.

Sony has allowed a single third-party platform which has no billing support, subscription or otherwise. Microsoft has no third-party platform support. All of these consoles come with significant licensing expenses and do not support software subscriptions. All of these consoles require major rework when porting existing PC titles due to custom CPUs, GPUs, and input frameworks.<p>Mobile as we understand it is either completely off limits (iOS) or unaccustomed to keyboard and mouse input (Android).<p>So if you are in the business of selling subscriptions and in-app upgrades to game software that requires keyboards, mice, and untrammeled billing pathways, what are your options for addressing new markets?<p>There is one: quasi-consoles.

Especially given how politicians today seem to shun science. Part of the problem is that there is no centralized location for public discourse on a subject that brings together all vantage points. Fortunately, we can leverage DOI links on a policy while debating it, and include a wiki for each benefit and drawback. Consider:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#3</a><p>Facts must be backed up by research by linking to a scientific paper using a DOI. Evidence can also be submitted using a wiki-style format, such as:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#2</a><p>This could include video evidence, calculations, budgetary impacts, and other details necessary to make an informed decision on whether the benefit or drawback is sound. The culmination of benefits and drawbacks are succinctly summarized so that people can still make an informed choice without delving too deeply. (But people can go deeper if they want, assuming the topic interests them.)<p><i>Opinion vs. Fact</i><p>Part of the issue here is that I think you're looking at the system from ""opinions"" being presented. The system caters more to <i>facts</i> than <i>opinions</i>, in the same way that StackOverflow emphasizes <i>correct answers</i> over <i>opinions</i>. The example I gave illustrates how this would work: ""Some consider marijuana use to be morally wrong."" This is an opinion, which is easily countered with: ""Enforcing the status quo morality may reflect and reinforce deep-rooted prejudices,"" with a citation.<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/PK69j#3</a><p><i>Reputation</i><p>There are a number of ways reputation can be earned in a given subject-matter: For a presenting a fact that gets a large number of up-votes; for graduating an accredited university; for proposing drawbacks and benefits that pass moderation; by attaining up-votes on drawbacks and benefits. Reputation can be lost by casting down-votes or by receiving down-votes.<p><i>Institution</i><p>I believe you assumed that this system would be initially available to the general public, but that need not be true. It could, to start, be opened to politicians, lawyers, and scientists, who have a vested interest in ensuring the system does not get abused. Effectively as a means to facilitate the communications process around proposing and accepting policies. This would eliminate your concerns regarding a Reddit-style law.<p><i>Self-Referential</i><p>The system could be made self-referential whereby changes to the system can be proposed using the system.<p><i>Conclusion</i><p>Pointing out the flaws in a system is a great way to open discussion, and I thank you. Pointing out how the system can be improved to eliminate or mitigate those flaws is even better.",1357518368

If you ask me for a tl;dr I'll kick you in the shins.<p>I'm so happy to see them measuring ""median item impressions"" rather than ""mean item impressions.""  Many of the underlying variables describing consumer behavior aren't normally distributed.  Talking about ""average number of friends invited"" when 50% of your users invite 0, 25% invite 1, 13% invite 2, etc. but 3 users invite 5,000 will necessarily lead you to propose bad product ideas and decisions.<p>However, I'm curious about the experimental design.  For example, was this tested on new users, old users, or both?  Changing a fundamental part of a site's experience like this will have some cost as users acclimate.  I'd wager Etsy's audience is less technically inclined, too, so it might take them longer to acclimate.<p>They also commit a small fallacy when they talk about how they should have done it instead, and IMO it's a fallacy that frequent A/B testing encourages people to commit.  They suggest that instead they should have determined first whether more items are better and faster items are better.<p>On the most surface level, perhaps there's something about more items AND faster items that outperforms either one or the other in isolation.  That's easy enough to accomplish, technically.  You use different statistical tests, but it's possible at the cost of perhaps a larger sample size.<p>On a deeper level, you're providing the users with a fairly different overall user experience.  Their sense of where things are placed, what they're supposed to do when they want to ""see more,"" how they know they have the opportunity to ""see more,"" etc. are aspects of the infinite scroll design that aren't encapsulated in either rendering more items or rendering those items more quickly.<p>For example, can users bookmark specific search result pages under the current design?  Can they still do the same thing under the ""infinite scroll"" design? I imagine there are lots of little things like this and that the UX difference alone would have a larger impact on the results than just changing the number of products per page.<p>To get more meaningful results from this, I'd run this experiment under the following assumptions.<p>1. Assume that existing users will be more impacted by this change than new users.  Therefore the cost of ""failure"" for existing users is higher.<p>2. Assume that at the end of the day the #1 thing Etsy cares about is ""dollar throughput"" of the Etsy platform.  Engagement, favoriting, searching, etc. are all positive indicators of an increased dollar velocity.<p>3. Assume they have information about what aspects of a users' first visit are indicators of their long-term ability to contribute to Etsy's dollar throughput.<p>4. Assume that eventually every user will have the same experience, new or existing alike.<p>So, I'd start by running the experiment with new users only.  Over the course of a week or a month I'd put a % of the users who joined each day into the ""infinite scroll"" bucket.  I'd then run the study as a longitudinal study.<p>Assumption (3) can guide us as to whether we need to cut off the experiment early.  The length of the study would be determined by the particularities of an Etsy user's life-cycle, e.g., maybe given a cohort of users, we care about the length of time it takes 75% of the eventual purchasers to make their first purchase.<p>Because of assumption (4) we know that if the ""infinite scroll"" design is terrible for new users, we never have to bother testing it on existing users.<p>[1]: Non-technical users, in particular, are sensitive to sudden change.  I forget where, but I read a research paper once that implied that the worst thing you can do to harm a person's user experience is change the placement of links, buttons, etc.  You can change the color, text, icons, etc. but if you change the placement, they essentially have to ""re-learn"" the interface.<p>IIRC, the users were given a task (e.g., ""create a document"") and they measured two core variables: time to accomplish the given task and time until their ""performance"" at a given task was equivalent to the control user interface.<p>Changing the placement of a certain action in the UI had a deeper and longer-lasting impact on users' ability to perform tasks than changing anything else about the UI by a large margin.",1357517886

If you allow yourself to consider the case where each entry in the matrix has different type everything is fine. You just end up with matrix product rules like:<p>[type(a) type(b)][type(c); type(d)]  = type(a)type(c) + type(b)type(d)<p>Which puts constraints on the types of the various entries in the product, but doesn&#x27;t restrict them to being the same in each matrix or vector.

Why wouldn&#x27;t we have a similar generalization of constraints in the matrix case? The model that arrays of objects must all be the the same type simply doesn&#x27;t fit with the analysis in this case.

None of those have been a &quot;tidal wave&quot; of innovation, or success, or money.  At least that I can see.   Internet Explorer became dominant, but mainly due to bundling and that has gone away.  IIS was a popular web server for a long time and people have written web sites using microsoft technology, but .net which is just a renamed MFC, isn&#x27;t really much more used outside the same types of shops that used it before 1995.  Yes, the mono project brought it to linux and made C# a more viable language, but that wasn&#x27;t Microsoft&#x27;s doing.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m missing something.  Xbox and Xbox online are huge money sinks that I don&#x27;t know if MSFT is ever going to recover the money from.  The stock has been flat during that period while google, amazon and apple have been going like gangbusters. (And given the level of monetary inflation over the past 15 years flat means down.)  Yes, it did boom during the bubble but that was %100 windows and office from the boom in companies putting computers on everyone&#x27;s desk. And yes, it&#x27;s grown the past couple of years after being flat from 2001-2011. But that&#x27;s not a result of the 1995 &quot;initiative&quot;.<p>Microsoft, like Apple, unfortunately for both, doesn&#x27;t quite get the internet.

My most salient experience in the area is from working on a data analysis pipeline web app written in Haskell. The type checker regularly caught bugs that would have taken me hours to deal with if I had had to track them down after something broke at runtime.<p>On the other side of the equation, again in my experience, the actual cost of a good static type system is minimal.

Often times developers would get less than %30 of the revenue for their products.  And they had many more hoops to jump thru to get to the market, could only even get a meeting to try and get on mobile devices if they were already a large company, and had to work with terrible SDKs, etc.<p>Apple democratized and revolutionized that entire industry, providing a level playing field where I can compete with Omni, and we both have the same hoops to jump thru and get the same deal. We both get a much better deal than before.<p>The $99 fee covers the cost of administering the developer program.  This program is hugely popular, and is already overrun with people who just want to get access to early versions of iOS before they are released publicly. Even with the $99 fee.    It&#x27;s a very low fee so that anyone serious can afford it, but high enough to keep out the problematic people who would abuse the service and overwhelm Apple&#x27;s developer support resources.<p>Seriously, I find it kinda curious that you&#x27;re complaining about $99 as if it&#x27;s some big barrier.<p>The idea that an &quot;Apple centric skill-set is not transferrable to other platforms&quot; is pretty darn silly.

However, being close to the thresholds means that you need to be on the pessimistic side of how many physical qubits you need per logical qubit. As I mentioned in my other comment, even Martinis (whose group is, as you say, very good) is still several orders of magnitude short in terms of the number of physical qubits needed to implement one logical qubit, let alone the hundreds to thousands of logical qubits necessary to do interesting computations.<p>Packing more qubits in seems to me like it&#x27;s going to be a very challenging problem. Looking at Martinis&#x27;s recent Nature paper,   9 qubits are taking up something like 2 x 4 mm. Making these smaller would be nontrivial for many reasons: they each have their own microwave coupling line (which requires a certain amount of length); the coherence properties of superconducting qubits seem to care about how much surface you have relative to bulk metal, which is a loser for shrinking the devices; presumably jamming them together presents crosstalk issues; etc. Realistically, you also need to add a bunch of other types of electronics down there to handle multiplexing a la D-Wave. I don&#x27;t know that these obstacles are insuperable, but I&#x27;m definitely a little skeptical that this road leads to useful technology.",1430344331

9462028,comment,9459861,9459861,0,0,reasonattlm,,,"To date progress in the development of stem cell treatments has been accompanied by a markedly lower risk of cancer than was expected at the outset. The characteristic decline in stem cell activity with age is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation that reduces cancer risk: there is a balance between on the one hand the risk of cancer due to over-active damaged cells, and on the other hand the failure of tissues and organs due to loss of maintenance activities on the part of stem cells. It is the responsibility of stem cells to deliver supplies of fresh, fit cells as needed to replace those that have become damaged, worn, or have reached the inherent limits imposed on replication of somatic cells. That supply tapers off in old age, however, as stem cells gather damage and spend ever more time quiescent rather than active.<p>Despite the comparative lack of cancer resulting from stem cell therapies, there is still every reason to expect that caution should attend the development of any therapy that spurs greater regeneration in old tissues. The cells in those tissues have a higher load of nuclear DNA damage, and thus a greater cancer risk attends their activity. Yet in practice it isn&#x27;t working out to be as great a risk as expected, or at least not so far based on the data gathered to date. Why this is the case is an interesting question with no solid answer at this time.<p>The replication limits of somatic cells depend in part on telomere shortening. Telomeres are repeated lengths of DNA at the ends of chromosomes. A little of that length is lost with each cell division, and very short telomeres trigger cellular senescence or programmed cell death. In comparison stem cells retain long telomeres, and thus the ability to continually create new daughter somatic cells with long telomeres to deliver into the tissues they support. This maintenance of telomere length in stem cells is achieved through the activity of telomerase, an enzyme that adds repeated DNA sequences to the ends of chromosomes.<p>Based on all of the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that more telomerase activity in more cells would mean a greater risk of cancer. It would mean cells being more active, and older, more damaged cells being more active. In mice, however, this is not what happens. The risk of cancer actually falls, even as life span is lengthened: researchers believe there is increased stem cell activity and tissue maintenance, but not enough time in even the extended mouse life span for the other shoe to drop and cancer risk to catch up. A firm and comprehensive analysis of what exactly is going on inside these mice is probably still a few years away, however. Nonetheless, the picture painted above suggests that we should be cautious about extrapolating a beneficial balance of time and cellular activity in mice to indicate that telomerase treatments would be similarly great for humans. The span of time is different, our telomere biology is different, and the balance of aging and cell activity is different.<p>On the other hand, the medical community seems to be doing pretty well with stem cell treatments that are just another way of spurring increased cell activity and tissue maintenance in old, damaged tissues. Enhanced telomerase activity seems worthy of further investigation for all the same reasons that stem cell therapies were worthy of clinical development. I don&#x27;t see telomerase therapies as a treatment for aging per se, however. The approach of increased telomerase activity doesn&#x27;t address the underlying issues that cause stem cell decline, but instead forces damaged cells to get back to work by overriding the normal reactions of an aged biochemistry. In the view of aging as accumulated cellular damage, stem cell failure with age is an evolved reaction to an increasingly damaged tissue environment. The best way forward is to repair that environment, not override the signals. As first generation stem cell treatments have shown, however, it is possible to achieve beneficial results by taking this path, even while failing to address the root causes of aging. Benefits are good, but we shouldn&#x27;t let them distract us from the end goal.",1430343852

That said, the entire mindset behind this article strikes me as fundamentally wrong-headed. The mindset is “either you have static types, or you don&#x27;t.” From that perspective, if you can think of any situation in which you can&#x27;t encode the problem into static types, then you might as well throw the whole idea out the window and just hope things work at run-time. In the real world, this isn&#x27;t at all how it works.<p>The last couple of decades have been a story of type systems slowly but surely expanding the class of problems for which type-safety is practical and worthwhile. There are still problems for which this <i>isn&#x27;t</i> the case, and there will likely still be problems like this for a long time. Proponents of static typing aren&#x27;t arguing against this fact; they&#x27;re arguing that for all the myriad cases where static types <i>can</i> help, we should use them. For the cases we can&#x27;t figure out, fine, just use ints. But for those functions, write a lot of tests, and be sure to rewrap those ints in semantic types as soon as possible.<p>In short, whether or not my static type system can handle linear algebra is completely irrelevant to me.

I cook a lot, and like it.  However, sometimes I do not have the time or do not want to devote the time to cook, so I go to a restaurant.  Plus, there are some things I can&#x27;t do well at home for lack of equipment.  For those cases, I go to a restaurant.  I don&#x27;t care much about design and lighting, hate having what most places call music, don&#x27;t like much background noise, and really don&#x27;t care what the food looks like on the plate.  It is a predominantly functional experience for me.  Some of my favorite restaurants are very Spartan affairs.<p>Now, I have no idea how typical I am and suspect it varies based on location.

While Microsoft (during Ballmer) had a slow change (going more opensource) from the bottom-to-top, there has been a faster change now from top-to-bottom. I remember Scott Hanselman, Scott Guthrie and Phil Haack (now at Github) during Ballmer as opensource contributors.<p>Ballmer allowed opensource during his leadership, but employees would be more &quot;targetted&quot; when it&#x27;s not the right direction and it hasn&#x27;t has &quot;intermediate&quot;/&quot;fast&quot; results... It&#x27;s a much slower progress.<p>I believe Nadella has a lot of thanks for the change that Microsoft made before he stepped up and &quot;received&quot; the fame. There was a short release afterwards of his stepup with a Office version for iOS and Android, you just don&#x27;t do that within the month.<p>Some things he did within the first 12 months:<p>- Bought Nokia ( they already worked very together closely, this was probably been going on for years )<p>- Office for iOS and Android ( was created during Ballmer, but probably got approval during Nadella)<p>- Opensource .Net ( opensource started with Asp.Net MVC 2, which wasn&#x27;t an all-in though, i think of it as a &quot;test&quot; internally)<p>- Cloudobile - connecting mobile with the cloud ;) ( this is definatly more Nadella&#x27;s style, coming from Azure)<p>But it isn&#x27;t all &quot;that good&quot;, a lot of people have been layed off ( approx. 18.000 ).

Then, slyly, when talking of the US, he purports that austerity took place until 2011 when wiser heads prevailed, reversed the trend and then the economy boomed. The problem is, when evaluating the austerity of the US, his numbers include monetary policy, being adjusted for inflation.

Hindley-Milner type systems like Haskell often don&#x27;t allow dependent types[1], which means that a 2D vector and 3D vector are the same type <i>unless</i> their dimensions are known at compile-time (which is oftentimes not the case). This is a <i>big problem</i>, because I may want to run a regression on an unknown number of variables, but also constrain the number of variables in alternative regressions to use the same number of variables.<p>In Haskell, you might solve this problem with a tuple, except then (1) your vector elements may be of the wrong type (bad!), and (2) You can only have vectors of length 63 or less.[2]<p>By contrast, in MATLAB, it&#x27;s trivial to declare a number that may also be a vector, but act like a scalar for certain operations, but also be correctly &quot;incompatible&quot; with vectors of incorrect dimensions[3].<p>Yeah, you can do this in Haskell/Scala/Go/<insert-language-here>. But it&#x27;s really, really annoying.<p>There is one assignment that I had in school which was done in MATLAB, and just for fun, I tried reimplementing it in a few other languages (Haskell, Python, Go, and a few others). I ended up giving up in frustration with <i>all</i> three of these, whereas the original MATLAB assignment only took a few hours (most of which was figuring out the math behind it, not writing the code). My Python attempt was the one which came the closest, but even then it was just so hideous that I couldn&#x27;t bear to work on it any longer[4].<p>[0] I haven&#x27;t used Julia, so I can&#x27;t say whether the optional typing there solves this problem or not.<p>[1] At least, Haskell didn&#x27;t as of a couple of years ago, which was the last time I checked.

9461797,comment,9461112,9461536,0,0,comex,,,"Personally, I find something enjoyable about viewing desktop websites on mobile and zooming in and out - something about an instinctive sense of place (navigation in two dimensions rather than the usual one of scrolling), combined with being able to navigate a truly densely packed interface on a small screen, rather than having to pare things down to some extent as you see in most mobile websites and apps, feels vaguely empowering.  At its best, this creates something of an accidental zooming user interface[1].  A particularly good example is the New York Times desktop homepage, where zooming around something vaguely resembling a physical newspaper, organized by topic in a predictable layout, is just nicer than scrolling the linear list of articles on the mobile homepage, with only a few visible per screenful - it&#x27;s no accident the former was featured repeatedly in earlier iPhone keynotes and advertising.  These days they send mobile browsers the mobile site by default, but thankfully it has a &quot;view desktop site&quot; link; &quot;modern&quot; responsive websites may adapt better to screens of varying sizes, but they have the annoying side effect that you typically can&#x27;t get to the desktop layout on mobile.  (This would be pretty easy to fix for either the site or the browser, but I&#x27;ve never seen it implemented.)<p>I don&#x27;t know where you got Reddit from, but it has not only a modern mobile website[2], but multiple client apps available on iOS and Android.  Yet I read Reddit on my phone exclusively using the desktop site.  Same goes for Hacker News and the various third-party webapps and native apps.<p>I&#x27;ve never used a non-iOS mobile OS for an extended period of time, so I don&#x27;t really know what automatic reflow feels like in practice, but I can certainly imagine it would be useful to people with similar preferences to mine, in a way that mobile sites don&#x27;t substitute for.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooming_user_interface</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://m.reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.reddit.com</a>",1430341637

So then the question is this: Does &quot;fancy food&quot; from a high end chef like David Chang have a wide enough appeal to solicit the type of volume needed for this to be successful? I suspect it does in pockets of NYC. From a higher vantage point, I&#x27;m less optimistic.<p>Restaurants are about more than food though. Their job is to set a stage with design, lighting, music, background noises, service, plating, and conversation amongst other human beings. That&#x27;s why people pay $1000 for a bottle of wine, $45 for a New York Strip, or $4.50 for a cup of coffee. If we didn&#x27;t care about these other things, we would all be getting delivery, making our own food, or eating out of vending machines and paying 75% less to do so.",1430341227

It was a sad trainwreck that was hard to watch.

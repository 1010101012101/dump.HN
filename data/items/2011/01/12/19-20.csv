Do you honestly believe someone could write 100 of those articles every day? Even if it were possible (and I'm not really sold on that), that sounds absolutely soul-crushing.<p>And yes, you (and other commenters) do bring up a good point in that $1 has a lot more value in many parts of the world.

2097412,comment,2095334,2095334,0,0,neilk,,,"MediaWiki is one of those websites that is translated into nearly every language known to humans, and it has a pretty elegant system for this. Not perfect, but good enough for almost anything. You can get away with minimal markup in the lexicon this way:<p>* In the code, messages are specified abstractly, e.g.<p><pre><code>   print getMessage('found_x_files_in_x_dirs', $fileCount, $dirCount);\n</code></pre>\n* Languages each have their own class with a 'convertPlural' function that maps the quantity to the forms. So in english, that function might be simple, for Arabic, it's complex: <a href=""http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/languages/classes/LanguageAr.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/phase3/lang...</a><p>* Lexicons use a simple wiki markup to define the different forms of their language. To illustrate that the arguments don't have to be used in order, I did it in the reverse of how the code passes arguments.<p><pre><code>    'found_x_files_in_x_dirs' => \n    ""I searched $2 {{PLURAL:$2|directory|directories}} \n    and found $1 {{PLURAL:$1|file|files}}""\n</code></pre>\nSo for a language like Arabic you write a similar pipe-delimited list of forms. You just have to know how to lay down the six different forms in the order that LanguageAr.php defined.<p>Note how this side-steps most (but not all) complicating issues like case or gender, so you don't have to mark it that way in the lexicon. If the word is used in the feminine gender, accusative case plural in the sentence, that's what the translator writes.<p>All this is mediated with the amazing <a href=""http://translatewiki.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://translatewiki.net/</a> website, run mostly by volunteers.",1294862208

The issue is in defining the problem where as engineering is about applying knowledge to a problem.<p>The theory I'm putting forth is that Google tends to see things in the abstract.  ""The world needs a web based office package"" vs ""Company X has 100,000 employees and they want this feature"".  The later response is how a traditional software company like Microsoft thinks.<p>So for Google solving the problem of medical records for the world means going to people they perceive as deep thinkers (like researchers) and devising a system in a vacuum.

I heard (from a guy who worked on it) about a bug in a prototype version of a processor from a major company that didn't cause any correctness problems but was a major performance problem: one of its four cache ways simply didn't have its power rails connected.<p>Some CPU verification code I wrote on an internship a couple years ago discovered a few bugs in a certain fairly widely-used processor, though I'm pretty sure they were all logic-level problems (i.e. RTL bugs, not circuit level ones)...<p>- The L1 D-cache tracked clean/dirty status at half-cache-line granularity, and if you did a store (with just the right timing) to one half of a cache line you had just explicitly cleaned with a cache-clean instruction, the dirty bit wouldn't get set on that half line, so as soon as the cache got flushed the data written by the store was lost.<p>- The prefetcher would shut down sometimes as a power saving technique, but if you laid out the right sequence of cache operations and branches in the last 32 bytes of a 4KB page, sometimes concurrent TLB misses would cause it to not get re-enabled, meaning the processor would lock up, stop fetching instructions and just sit there dead in the water until an interrupt came in (assuming interrupts were enabled).<p>There were a couple more, but I thought those were the more interesting ones.  Granted, these weren't bugs that were likely to be encountered in normal usage for various reasons (in addition to being <i>extremely</i> difficult to reproduce sometimes -- i.e. on one in particular you could run the exact same sequence of instructions from system power-on and sometimes it happened, sometimes it didn't), but bugs nonetheless.",1294861042

For instance: If you are on a tunnelled IPv6 connection (i.e. non-native, like teredo) it will attempt to detect this and <i>block</i> IPv6-connectivity because Google has chosen for you that this may provide an inferior web-experience with higher latency compared to plain IPv4, if available.<p>Google's IPv6-efforts so far, while I could give them credit for at least have taken a few baby-steps, is by far the most cowardly I have seen anyone take.

I originally thought it would mainly be used for broadcast, but one of the early paying users is actually using it a lot to ask questions about his particular niche (happens to be Gin).<p>Another thing I've started to realise is that it is much easier to react than it is to act. If you are sharing content fairly regularly using something like Buffer then it provides many opportunities to react with people who respond to the content shared.<p>I think, as with any tool, it can be used in an ineffective way. I would definitely not recommend people use Buffer and nothing else.",1294859056

That would explain Raymond’s ""if all the stars line up exactly right"" line, since the hole in the forwarding logic must have been really small (or it would have been caught in testing).",1294859054

I've looked into Google keyword tool, but haven't thought of using it this way. Will look more into it.<p>No, iPhone app is not everything. You're right, in fact, the main juice is in Web service. iPhone is just a client based on my API. Starting with an iPhone app was just market position approach. There is no app in the app-store which provides this simple solution, so thought let's start with that, and then expand. Web service solution is coming soon though.<p>Thanks again for your valuable feedback.",1294858965

However, in the real world, they are usually either objects or functions.<p>Also, when you write code this way, you don&#x27;t end up calling the constructors very often. You end up with a big up-front construction/wiring-up phase, after which your objects/functions go about their business handling user input and making server requests.<p>I&#x27;ve found that this, combined with an MVC or MVVM methodology, essentially breaks my code down into functions and data records, with the two rarely intertwining. You basically only use the &quot;new&quot; operator either at the start of the program&#x27;s lifetime, or when you&#x27;re converting data from one data type to another.",1375171159

I believe most entrepreneurs, including those who get VC money, aren&#x27;t looking to hit eBay sized home runs. I think many just want to build a successful business.<p>Their options? Bootstrap or raise VC. Raising VC sounds like an easier road and has all the glitz and glamour. As a result, many entrepreneurs go that route, few get it and most abandon their idea altogether.<p>Now the entrepreneur is stuck in an odd position of having to pitch and behave as if they&#x27;re &quot;changing the world&quot;.<p>There&#x27;s no solution to the problem as far as I know but it&#x27;s really a lose lose situation. It&#x27;s too bad because there&#x27;s a lot of value that disappears in the process because no financing model exists/works for the moderately successful startup.",1375171038
6125802,comment,6125565,6125565,19,0,onion2k,,,"Successfully raising capital is pretty much always seen as a win - a group of professionals have examined you, your team, and your idea and decided that it&#x27;s worthwhile risking a sum of money backing you. That gives you a runway to build a userbase without needing to worry about being profitable. In some cases it means you can actually build something that you couldn&#x27;t build without the money. Capital certainly gives you time to focus and build faster.<p>The problem though, is that capital is also a shield against the reality of building a _business_. It saves you from talking to potential customers for a while. You can kid yourself that you&#x27;re &quot;working on the product&quot;, doing the fun stuff like writing code instead of the hard stuff like selling. Many, many tech entrepreneurs conflate &quot;building a product&quot; and &quot;building a business&quot;. Making the most amazing product in the world is pointless if you can&#x27;t market it. If you bootstrap or borrow then you have no choice but to get out there and find real, paying customers because otherwise you&#x27;re screwed so much earlier. That changes your focus in a very good way.<p>It surprises me that investors put money into teams of hugely technical people who can&#x27;t sell the amazing tech they can build and yet don&#x27;t insist that they expand the team to bring in people who _can_ sell right at the start. It&#x27;s often almost an afterthought, something that can happen later once the product is &quot;finished&quot;. Raising capital _never_ means you won&#x27;t need to do sales and marketing. Every successful business has to. The earlier the sales team is in place and having input into the business the better.",1375171022

My pool was quite drained 1 or 2 years ago, but I managed to enlarge it by taking longer breaks, shutting down completely on weekends, eliminating foods I&#x27;m intolerant to (gluten & lactose inflame my gut pretty quickly), introducing intermittent fasting (no food until noon), adding fish oil and vit D, switching from cardio to HIIT workouts, and keeping caffeine intake constant. I can now be highly productive for at least 7-8h per day, and then still focus on my family (vs turning into a couch zombie). Lack of sleep (< 6h; optimum is 8h) still kills me though.<p>I think intermittent fasting and fish oil did the most for me in this regard.

Yes, there&#x27;s some astroturfing going on. It seems to be at both ends of the scale though. The other possibility besides Telco astroturfing is that some of the negative reviews are left by people who dislike the Obama administration (which Crawford formerly worked for). A negative mention on a conservative blog might have attracted readers with a negative opinion to the Amazon.com page.",1375168899

To show something is non-obvious, examiners will usually take two documents which together disclose all the features of the claimed invention, and say it would be obvious to combine them.<p>This is how it works in the US (and is quite frankly often quite unfair to the applicant, because the two documents may indeed have all the features, but the invention lies in the idea of combining these unrelated idea to result in something that is greater than the sum of its parts).<p>In most large juristrictions (excluding the US), there must be something that would lead a PSA to combine the ideas in the documents. So for example, if a claim is to features A, B, C, D and E, then to combine documents X and Y, they should both disclose say features A, B and C, and then one may disclose D, and the other may disclose E. In the US, it is very common for the examiner to find documents which disclose A, B, C and D, and then find a document that discloses E and has no relation to the first document (ie, the document is from a completely different field of endeavour) and combine them.<p>What this shows is that the US actually has a substantially higher standard in many ways than most countries. But the problem comes back to the prior art base; if you good citations are not found juring examination (and hey, examiners are people like you and me), they cannot make a good case that the application is not novel or is obvious.<p>> The requirement of non-obviousness sounds great in theory, but is in reality a joke, since the only test used is that of prior art.<p>Well no, it&#x27;s not. If the claim is to a known idea with a well known alternative in the art (say a house put together using screws instead of nails), then that&#x27;s clearly not inventive, and an examiner will object as such. These are often known as workshop improvements or well known alternatives in the art.<p>My question to you is that if a) the law requires evidence, and not just opinion, and b) it must be shown that something is was obvious at the application&#x27;s priority date, what else is there to use apart from the prior art? Me saying &quot;Yeah, I&#x27;m pretty sure that would have been obvious 4 years ago&quot; is definitely not good enough, so how can I prove it without other documents?<p>> It is possible for an invention to be obvious and yet for no prior art to exist.<p>But again, the law requires that you can prove that, and if it is the case that the invention is obvious, there will almost without a doubt be some document or documents which shows this. Human beings are pretty good at documenting pretty much everything, it&#x27;s just a matter of being able to find it.<p>The issue here is that most people don&#x27;t understand the role prior art plays. They assume that it&#x27;s only used for objections based on novelty, and it this is certainly not the case. Maybe many of the readers here could spend some time actually reading the objections given by offices like the USPTO and see that actually, the way they thought things should be run, but assumed they weren&#x27;t, are actually standard practice.<p>If you believe you have proof an accepted application is not novel, or is obvious, then by all means, get on Ask Patents and submit it. But it is not, nor will it ever be, good enough to just say &quot;Aww yeah, pretty sure I would&#x27;ve come up with that, now I&#x27;ve read their solution&quot;, which is how most people start when talking crap about these matters.

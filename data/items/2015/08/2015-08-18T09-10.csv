But this is changing. We&#x27;re seeing higher education and maybe some lower education being automated. In japan we saw a robotic hotel, there&#x27;s plenty of efforts to automate the food industry(both making and serving food), and in healthcare we&#x27;re on the way to become much more effective at a fast rate with many(hundreds of genetic treatments in clinical trials,great improvements in targeted cancer therapies, artificial pancreases and continuous glucose monitoring are on the way to solve diabetes , etc ,etc) .<p>2. How much more can they grow ?  Will said growth be enough to stop job decline in other sectors  ?<p>All those sectors grew due to stuff like cheap credit, degree inflation, more expandable income, growing country budgets, etc.<p>But will those conditions continue to be true in a world with a lot of unemployment in other sectors - much more than we saw in the past ?<p>Also - all those three sectors are 23% of the economy. We&#x27;re talking about 40% of jobs at risk due to automation in 20 years. So those sectors would have to double/triple themselves to compensate.

The balance changes that they made were a significant improvement, and I&#x27;d consider the current D3 one of Blizzard&#x27;s great successes as gameplay goes. It greatly expanded on Diablo 2 with completely new and fresh mechanics that have been an absolute blast to explore as a gamer. It was a little too unforgiving before those balance changes, with bumpy progression and a difficult skill cliff, and overly reliant on the auction house (not intentionally in a gimmicky way; it&#x27;s just how it turned out when AH prices dropped ridiculously low due to surplus supply). It&#x27;s great now though. Diablo 3&#x27;s artwork is beautiful, and to achieve it they developed an innovative new style which they presented at GDC 2012:<p><a href=""http://gdcvault.com/play/1015306/The-Art-of-Diablo"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gdcvault.com/play/1015306/The-Art-of-Diablo</a><p>(This is what I mean by &quot;fresh&quot; by the way: something new and interesting that you haven&#x27;t seen before, even in an industry that tries it all. The painterly style was definitely fresh, and even in the years since then I haven&#x27;t seen an imitation. I suspect it&#x27;s too technically challenging, requiring a custom engine and a different way of designing environments.)<p>I guess you can tell that I&#x27;m a fan. I think you hit on all the things that Blizzard does well: repeatable without repetitive, simple but deep with high skill cap, where you discover new things about the game mechanics yourself over time. Diablo 3 is especially fun because of its multiplayer coop. It&#x27;s great to get the S.O. or friends in the same room and collaborate, especially on console.<p>Diablo 3 has continued to trickle out new content over time for free after its expansion, Reaper of Souls, which has further helped to improve balance and make it interesting. I wish they would release more content though, since the game by its nature is ultimately repetitive. (Hard to justify financially with no recurring subscription. I would be very happy to pay for one if it meant more content!) There are rumors that Blizzard will release another expansion, which I will be super excited to explore if they do. I personally feel it&#x27;s one of the best games ever made, and definitely the best action RPG. I don&#x27;t think this quality of design can be boiled down just to a list of things they do well. It&#x27;s definitely something more than that. They have an internal compass of what it takes to make awesome games, and they&#x27;re willing to wait and iterate on their development as long as it takes to get there.<p>Heroes of the Storm I&#x27;m skeptical of. It&#x27;s much more directly a rip-off than any other Blizzard game, and I haven&#x27;t seen much fresh or new come out of it yet.",1439890574

How do we generalize this solution such that it helps programmers building compiler platforms like LLVM and Roslyn? How will it help programmers researching neural networks? How will it help programmers writing line of business applications? Databases? Apps? Financial backends? The vast majority of functions in today&#x27;s codebases do not map nicely to a 2D output.&quot;</i><p>I see BV&#x27;s essay focused on <i>learning</i> programming for people unfamiliar with programming.  For non-programmers, even simple syntax such as &quot;x=0; x=x+1&quot; looks strange and beginners can&#x27;t hold in their head what it does.  So instead trying to teach beginners the LOGO programming language to move turtles around on the screen or BASIC language of &quot;10 PRINT &quot;HELLO&quot; \n 20 GOTO 10&quot;, Brett shows a visualization where code syntax update its 2d output in a realtime feedback loop.  This can help novices make the leap from abstract syntax in a text editor to the concrete changes in the output.<p>Josh Varty is <i>going beyond the scope of newbies learning programming concepts</i>.  He&#x27;s trying to <i>generalize</i> it to <i>working practitioners who already understand programming</i> and make the &quot;Learnable Programming Model&quot; work for any arbitrary code to any type of visualization (beyond 2D if necessary).  The &quot;live coding for everything&quot; is an interesting concept to pursue but I don&#x27;t believe Brett&#x27;s essay had this wide of a scope.<p>I don&#x27;t believe working programmers who have already mastered how &quot;programming syntax maps to changing machine state&quot; needs visualizations for every line of source code.  However, JV&#x27;s generalized scope is applicable for working programmers to <i>verify</i> code for correctness and do sanity checks on what they think the code is doing.[2]  However JV&#x27;s ideas are not necessary for working programmers to <i>understand</i> programming.<p>In one case, JV uses this as example:<p><pre><code>  var result = DoTaxes(person);
</code></pre>
The professional programmer (not the &quot;learning programmer&quot;) doesn&#x27;t need a clever realtime visualization to &quot;understand&quot; DoTaxes() in the BV sense.  The programmer already has some idea that it probably has some code that performs multiplication and addition.  Possibly even a lookup table for different countries or taxing authorities.  The realtime visualization would help the professional programmer <i>verify</i> what the code actually does.  Since realtime isn&#x27;t available today, programmers get by with watch windows in visual debuggers, or manually insert printf()/console.log() statements.  However, the programmer doesn&#x27;t need BV visualizations to <i>grok the compsci topics</i> of the changing machine state inside DoTaxes().<p>tldr:  BV and JV are tackling 2 different issues.<p>[1]<a href=""http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/</a><p>[2]See how JV&#x27;s ALIVE demo visualization serves a different cognitive function from BV&#x27;s.

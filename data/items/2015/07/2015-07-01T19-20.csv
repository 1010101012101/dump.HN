Proprietary ≠ better that open source.<p>There are plenty of great open source text editors, but Sublime happens to be leading the pack.  It just so happens to be proprietary.  I don&#x27;t think that this is the sole reason for its success.  The coder behind the project is evidently extremely gifted, he values his time and you&#x27;re right, it is his choice to decide the license.  I&#x27;m merely making the point that if Sublime Text was open sourced, it needn&#x27;t spell the end of the line.  I dare say it could pocket Jon a tidy sum, if it were kickstarter&#x27;d for say... £5,000,000?  I know there are a LOT of coders out there who would splash out, in order to make this happen.<p>It&#x27;s pretty much donationware as it stands, and it could still continue to use this method as a source of income, even if the license became permissive.<p>I think one of the main differences between Atom and Sublime is performance, and that is largely down to the technology stacks in use.",1435780747

I bet I could convince you of the below if we were sitting opposite one another over a fine beer, but this channel is pretty limited. But let me try.<p>I like and appreciate a great many of your comments and think you&#x27;re a net positive contributor to HN, who has significantly enhanced the intellectual diversity of the site over the years (on a lot of things if not programming languages!). Unfortunately, your comments have also often been abrasive in a way that at best skirts the HN guidelines and sometimes plainly violates them. I wish you would work on eliminating that.<p>On a large public forum, when someone is a good writer and makes cogent points and is abrasive, it gives license to everyone who <i>isn&#x27;t</i> a good writer and <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> make cogent points to just (begging your pardon) pee in the pool. It&#x27;s a destabilizing influence. Being right makes it worse.<p>Considering that what we&#x27;re shooting for on HN is an internet version of reversing the arrow of entropy, i.e. hard, I wish you&#x27;d join in with that and help. It would benefit you too, since the community would suck less. Other users have done so. I&#x27;m one of them; I used to deliberately mix a little abrasion into my HN comments because I thought they would be lukewarm without it and I value lively language. But that was before I understood the dynamics of a large public forum.<p>Re the current thread? I doubt it makes sense to litigate the details, but FWIW I at most partly agree with the author. I think Lisp metaprogramming has significant advantages, but he overstated his case, and that plus being rude, then lashing out at downvoters, is guaranteed to attract more downvotes. Your comments were less rude and advocated a more conventional view, so it isn&#x27;t surprising that users preferred them. I mentioned the rudeness on both sides not to equate the two, but to point out that the HN guidelines still apply even when one is being provoked. In fact that&#x27;s when they apply most.

For those who feel strongly about things that &quot;should&quot; be done but aren&#x27;t, the idea of just shooting anyone who disagrees with you appeals to them.<p>There are two problems, one is that political change is gradual enough that its hard to see when you are young. I point out victories like gay marriage rights, civil rights before them, and the fact that prohibition, as a constitutional amendment, was reversed by the people. But I totally get how unsatisfying it is to have to wait 5 years for any movement. I also ask them to look around at their friends, for the world is made up of people who have grown up from kids, and if you look in the &quot;CEO&quot; ranks or the &quot;politician&quot; ranks you will see they cluster around ages. Those people were babies before and are running the world now, when you and your friends are their age you will likely be running the world so think about which friends you want to motivate into office and which ones you would rather not get elected :-).",1435779320

Both were initially developed for trusted local environments, then adapted for public network use some ten or fifteen years later and whatever security issues that brought was patched as they were found.

Here are just a few unique things:<p>* SF is one of the few cities I&#x27;ve ever been in where you will see motels in populous city areas.  Normally you&#x27;d think in such a crowded city having a huge parking lot on your property would be foolish, but it seems to be popular.  Off the top of my head I can think of 2 motels in the Marina/Cow Hollow area and 2 more in Soma, both of which are neighborhoods with insanely high real estate prices.<p>* In the areas in/around the Tenderloin there are a huge number of &quot;hotels&quot; that are basically extended stay residences for people who can&#x27;t afford any apartment in SF.  They&#x27;re a few hundred bucks a month and feature tiny, often dirty rooms with shared bathrooms and no kitchen.

It haunts me and in a way I found it a bit of a relief that despite ongoing depression issues, I could not relate:<p>“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”",1435778677

Those features were fine in the 70s but in the 80s they were problematic as people started to use pipelining and things like that.<p>The when you talk about RISC or CISC you&#x27;re talking about styles of ISA design influenced by the technical constraints of the eras they arose in.  ARM&#x27;s 64 bit design shares a great many elements with the classic RISC design: 32 registers, 32 bit instructions, load-store, no prediction, etc.  It&#x27;s much more similar to the original RISC processor than ARM&#x27;s 32 bit design was.

Additionally, I proposed that it falling out of favor despite Japanese chip-makers backing it might make it a nice candidate for trying to get them to open the design but still sell it. Concept is a proven design which can be verified by third parties, masked by whoever, and taped out at fab of their choice. Although, there&#x27;s work in moving to new nodes and that cost would be on whoever did it. The precedent is Gaisler&#x27;s SPARC-based processors and I.P. [2] that are dual-licensed as commercial and GPL with tools for easy customization.<p>Alternatively, I proposed the security enhancements for processors showing up in academia be applied to this or another processor with low market share as a differentiator. Some of these enhancements take almost no chip real-estate, esp simple tags & tag-checks. The chip designer could also make money for the semi-custom work. Time has passed, that didn&#x27;t happen for low market chips, and did happen for AMD+Intel for non-security applications [that I know of]. Matter of fact, even though my scheme didn&#x27;t happen, AMD is making so much money off the other half of my proposal that they could be cited when trying to convince chip-makers to do it for security enhancements with mass-market availability. So long as they don&#x27;t bear the cost of failure (huge in ASIC&#x27;s) they might go for it.<p>Finally, anyone wanting to deploy this or other things, remember the Structured ASIC&#x27;s with FPGA conversions. eASIC [3] has a long track record in this with offers down to 28nm. Gigoptix [4] does S-ASIC&#x27;s down to 28nm. Tekmos [5] offers a similar product at 350nm (good for budget masks). Just make sure you design in FPGA&#x27;s with ASIC transition in mind from the start & follow published advice on that (available with Google or consultation). The result is you prove it in FPGA&#x27;s, even use it on FGPA boards, and then move it to S-ASIC later for reduced costs/power + maybe speed increase. Authors are right that 180nm is a sweet spot although proving it at 350nm or higher first might be smarter given costs.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/surreptitiously.html#c1762647"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/09/surreptitious...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gaisler.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gaisler.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.easic.com/products/28-nm-easic-nextreme-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.easic.com/products/28-nm-easic-nextreme-3/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.gigoptix.com/products/asics/asic-type/structured-asic/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gigoptix.com/products/asics/asic-type/structured-...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.tekmos.com/products/asics/process-technologies"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tekmos.com/products/asics/process-technologies</a>",1435778153

I don&#x27;t understand why complicating thing that supposed to be simple helps you by any mean. On the top of that, I have seen several cases when Java programmers tipped over in their own code because of the complexity that they thought they understand, except there was a particular case when it was doing something else then expected.<p>Reasoning about Clojure (LISP) code is always easy because if you follow best practices you have small functions with very little context to understand.<p>On the top of these, I see the ratio of LOC 50:1 (worst case even higher) for Java : Clojure code that does the same thing. Usually people get triggered and say why does it matter, but in reality less code is better for everybody. Easier to understand, less chance of errors, etc. Correctness was long time lost for majority of Java developers, just put out a survey and you can see it for yourself.<p>It is also pretty common practice not to handle exceptions well and just let a DNS not found error explode as an IOexception and good luck tracking down what caused it (literary happened to me).<p>I understand that the average Java dev does not see any value in LISP (Clojure) but it silly to expect that the average of any group is going to lead the scientific advancement of any field including computer science.<p>One tendency that you can see if you are walking around with open eyes that the people who spent significant time in developing procedural code in an imperative language understand the importance of functional language features and the power of LISP. One can pretend it does not matter see you in 5-10 years and see how much this changes.<p><a href=""https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/577877590070919168"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/id_aa_carmack/status/577877590070919168</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X69_42Mj-g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8X69_42Mj-g</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76Vbsk_3J0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P76Vbsk_3J0</a>",1435777859

Also, as for people who disable JS... Very bluntly: fuck them.<p>Are there security concerns at running JS? Sure, but you can&#x27;t take away a HUGE building block of the web and expect everything to just work. It would be like taking away C from your computer, the whole thing comes crashing down. This and frameworks like this are normally for building interactive interfaces and/or full web apps which (let&#x27;s all say this together) ARE NOT POSSIBLE WITHOUT JAVASCRIPT. PERIOD. The web is a constantly moving target and if frameworks like this break accessibility then maybe accessibility tools need to be re-written/updated to handle client-side rendering (which is where the web is largely going, optionally with an initial render on the server side).<p>If we are talking about a blog then sure, needing JS is just stupid, my blog works just fine with or without JS but if I&#x27;m building a web app there is no way I can reasonably deliver both a cutting edge JS web app AND a static, submit-the-page-to-do-anything app. If you think that&#x27;s an easy thing to do then you&#x27;ve either never done it or the web app your were working on didn&#x27;t deserve to be called a web app. I hear this shit from people all the time about how you &quot;don&#x27;t need JS&quot;... Sure you don&#x27;t need JS just like you don&#x27;t need users which is where you will be if you deliver a shitty non-interactive website.<p>TL;DR: People not using JS are simply not worth the effort to support and if screen readers can&#x27;t handle JS client-side rendering it&#x27;s the readers then need to change not the web. It&#x27;s simply unreasonable to expect all web developers to account for every single edge case. Taking away JS is taking away one of the building blocks of the web and is a BAD idea.",1435777668

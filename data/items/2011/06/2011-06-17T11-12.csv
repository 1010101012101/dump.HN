2665158,comment,2653746,2656475,1,0,lsc,,,"hah.  I know my ancestors were farmers not just 'cause I am kinda built that way, but also 'cause both of my parents grew up on farms, and I still occasionally visit those farms.   But yeah;  I also lift, though not as part of a disciplined regimen.  I also prefer free weights to machines, in part 'cause I do have do move heavy things as part of my job, and I know that being able to handle things at odd angles and being able to stabilize things is probably more important (when trying to avoid injury) than raw strength of an isolated muscle.<p>I'm just saying, 5 sets of 5 reps, repeated for 3-4 different muscle groups doesn't take all that long.  I mean, maybe more than 10 minutes, but not all that much more.  I mean, strength is an important component of health, but I think cardio is also important.<p>That said, I have never really stuck to a disciplined routine;  usually I work out regularly for a few weeks, see huge gains in terms of strength (not much by way of fat loss) and then kinda get bored around the time when I am no longer able to add more weight every time I lift, so it's likely that if I stuck with it longer, I'd have a different opinion.<p>I mean, I'm 6' and 200#  right now, and I've been around this weight since about 22-23 or so.  I mean, it's been as high as 220 and as low as 190 but  in that range.  The fat is relatively distributed;   I do enough lifting that my man-boobs can usually pass for pecs as long as you don't touch them and I don't bounce too much.  It's pretty obvious if I let it go for a few months though.  I've got a little bit of a belly. A spare bicycle tire, I joke.  It's definitely there, but it's not really big enough to qualify as a full spare tire.<p>Thanks for the link though, it looks like an interesting program;  I'm going to try adapting it to just the adjustable barbells that I have (I don't have an olympic bar right now due to space constraints)   I've been taught 3 sets of 8 reps, but this program looks pretty good.   I will try it.  I've also been meaning to add squats with weights to my routine (I added body-weight squats some time ago.  I believe that I have good form at this point, but I think I'll get a professional to check out my form before I move to weight.  I think my form is good, but squats with bad form are probably the easiest way to injure yourself with weights.)<p>I mean, I am convinced that lifting burns calories far beyond lifting the bar; I mean, that's obvious from the heat you generate for the next day or two.  but nearly everyone I know who has gone from being fat to being not-fat has done a significant amount of cardio (and dieting) along the way.   What studies I have seen also suggest that cardio is important.",1308311523

That doesn't mean a programmer can't be just as good if he/she </i>doesn't* program in their spare time. It doesn't even mean that programming in their spare time helps these programmers get better, or that better programmers tend to program in their spare time. It's the other way around - programmers who program in their spare time tend to be better (and one direction being true doesn't mean the other direction is true).<p>The <i>only</i> reason people care about whether others program in their spare time, is because this correlation exists. If I know someone programs in their spare time, that's a positive signal that they are a good programmer. And it's a perfectly legitimate shortcut, when interviewing someone, to see whether they're good. People take offense at the suggestion that they're ""worse"" because they don't program in their spare time, when in reality, it's just a shortcut.<p>* I think most people will agree, at least in terms of averages. Nothing about any particular programmer.",1308308850
2665067,comment,2664232,2664510,4,0,wisty,,,"Well, I think difference between China and Europe is geography, and now a common language. Mandarin is spoken basically everywhere, except Hong Kong. Even the border provinces like Tibet (Xizhan) and Xinjiang (formerly a Turkic country) have a lot of Han migrants (or colonists, as some might say). It's easier to hold a country together when you share a common language. There are local dialects and languages, but school kids learn Mandarin, and the writing is all the same (though obviously the grammar, phrasing, and idioms will be different).<p>As for geography, China is very flat. It was flat 5000 years ago, and peasants (the occasional ruler with a civil engineering fetish) have been making it flatter for millennia. There's nowhere for an army to hide. Dissenters can hide in the concrete jungle, but you can't make any real strongholds. Also anyone who holds the Yellow River and Yangtze River will have strategic control of most of China, and the two rivers have been linked since (IIRC) the Qin dynasty.<p>As for the ""small towns"" being a little, well, dead, that's partly a result of rural poverty (and taxes redistributing wealth to the capitals); but also (as you said) of the bigger cities being of interest to young ambitious people.",1308308800

The guy crashed in to the side of us and span us 360 degrees. Immediately after the crash I checked on my wife and she said she was ok (I think she was in shock, though, later she had to be cut out of the car, needed oxygen, and was taken to hospital). I got out to see if the people in the other car were ok and saw them try and drive off, but their car was too damaged and they just drove into a few parked cars. I had a clear view of this.
When the policeman arrived that night to take our statement it was clear he'd had a long day for whatever reason.

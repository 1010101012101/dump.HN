10327593,comment,10326396,10327480,0,0,evanpw,,,"Education is never free; it always consumes some resources. The question is who should pay the cost: the student or everyone else?<p>In cases where basically everyone needs the education to succeed in society and the positive externalities are large (e.g., teaching young children to read), I think that the case for &quot;everyone else&quot; paying is pretty strong. In cases where the education is mostly consumption (i.e., the benefits all go to the student), the case for subsidizing is weak (e.g., a trust-fund kid getting multiple PhDs in impractical fields to have something to do).<p>So the main issue becomes: where does a Bachelor&#x27;s degree lie on this spectrum?<p>1. Fields of study are very heterogeneous. Some majors have a much larger return on investment than others, so subsidizing all &quot;higher education&quot; equally probably doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>2. Even in Western Europe, college attendance rates are only around 1/3. Is it right to have that 1/3 subsidized by the 2/3 who don&#x27;t go to college, and who on average have lower income?<p>3. (More speculative) To some extent, the payoff to a college education is not because of what you learn, but in signaling that you&#x27;re a smart, conscientious, perseverant person. In that case, a degree becomes less valuable the more people that have them, and the case for subsidizing what has become an arms race becomes a lot weaker.<p>4. If we spend a lot of money and effort propping up the current, very expensive, forms of higher education, we might discourage better ways of educating from emerging. One example is something like Coursera, where the marginal cost of adding one more student is basically zero, and everyone can learn from the very best educators in the field. Another would be separate institutions for education and for testing / accreditation. This would help with grade inflation, bring back the focus in the educational institutions to teaching rather than credentialing, and provide more accountability (% of graduates passing a common exam is a lot easier to compare than future income of graduates, and is less confounded by things like socio-economic status of students).",1443968989

Most people don&#x27;t realize that many battery chemistries actually don&#x27;t have a flat efficiency rating with charge: often, the closer to 100% charged you get, the less efficient (more loss) you have compared to what you&#x27;ll be able to extract later.<p>For example, charging from 0 to 100% might be 85% efficient for a given battery type. But charging it from 80% to 100% full might only be 40% efficient.<p>And this variable efficiency also applies to discharge as well. And the variables all change with what recent battery demands have been, let alone the current loads - but also cell voltages, temperature, age and cycle count.<p>Even planning to cope with self-discharge over days, weeks or months might benefit from smarter BMS. Some battery management systems even take into consideration thermal management (taking into account the cost of ramping up active cooling or throttling charge rates to keep batteries at a temperature efficient for taking charge).",1443967583

I&#x27;m convinced that you can take a time traveler from the 1910&#x27;s and he would get around in a modern western city within a week. All the basic things like electricity, sanitation, public transport, commerce, entertainment, fast communication via telegrams or phone already existed. One big difference to today is that poverty was reduced drastically, and access to these things is much easier and cheaper today. But there is a &#x27;good enough&#x27; barrier beyond which things don&#x27;t improve anymore, since they are good enough (see trans-sonic flight).<p>I think there have been much more drastic (positive) changes during the 19th century for the western world than during the 20th century.",1443967237

Hence the rise of the new multimodel databases like OrientDB and ArangoDB. So I think it is a question of what risk one is prepared to tolerate.",1443967229

In other words, E.T. is too busy playing his holographic, neural-tapped X-Box to communicate or look for us. (E.M. Forrester&#x27;s prophetic story, &quot;The Machine Stops&quot; foreshadowed this for mankind in 1909.) or possibility 2) A.I. and/or sentient life evolves into a higher-level, transdimensional abstraction beyond our perception and understanding (also known as the Singularity).",1401166795
7802940,comment,7801824,7801992,1,0,dchichkov,,,"They are on the right track weigh-wise. And it is <i>obvious</i> that boards should be molded out of carbon fiber and all the electronics and batteries should be inside. It is also obvious that wheels themselves should be out-runner motors. All four of them. From pure tech perspective this should be it. So Marbel team might be on the right track.<p>I hope they also will be able to make the board actually useful. That&#x27;s the best part of the Boosted team achievement by the way. Their board (I ride the thing 2-3 days a week) is a) actually usable b) fun. There are many un-obvious variables that come into the usability equation, especially for a piece of sports/recreational gear. In my opinion, boosted had managed to circumvent some of these by building their design around a good longboard and trying &#x27;not to ruin&#x27; the experience of a longboard. Even that took them a while, with quite a number of redesign iterations (see. <a href=""http://boostedboards.posthaven.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://boostedboards.posthaven.com/</a> ), including building a custom controller (that apparently had removed a nasty noise problem of the early releases). It looks like Marbel team decided not to go that way, they are building the board from scratch. Should make the challenge harder in my opinion. But hopefully they will overcome it and will be able to make a 3rd generation board :) that is actually useful :)",1401166752

One of the factors he mentioned in conclusion was the toughness of food.<p><a href=""http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.dk/2009/12/malocclusion-disease-of-civilization.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.dk/2009/12/malocclusion-di...</a><p><i>There are three main factors that I believe contribute to malocclusion in modern societies:<p>1. Maternal nutrition during the first trimester of pregnancy. Vitamin K2, found in organs, pastured dairy and eggs, is particularly important. We may also make small amounts from the K1 found in green vegetables.<p>2. Sucking habits from birth to age four. Breast feeding protects against malocclusion. Bottle feeding, pacifiers and finger sucking probably increase the risk of malocclusion. Cup feeding and orthodontic pacifiers are probably acceptable alternatives.<p>3. Food toughness. The jaws probably require stress from tough food to develop correctly. This can contribute to the widening of the dental arch until roughly age 17. Beef jerky, raw vegetables, raw fruit, tough cuts of meat and nuts are all good ways to exercise the jaws.</i><p>However, this covers development up to age 17. What would happen to the teeth of a grown up man if he stops using them, I&#x27;d also be interested to know (from sheer curiosity)",1401166141

7802876,comment,7801834,7802160,8,0,nostrademons,,,"My experience was Go was about 2-3x slower (development speed) than Python for prototyping.  Web programming, though, which is a particular strength of Python and a particular weakness of Go.  YMMV, of course.<p>I actually really do miss list comprehensions and properties and pervasive protocols for built-in types and really concise keyword/literal syntax.  I don&#x27;t miss metaclasses, and I only vaguely miss decorators.  (Go has struct annotations and compiler-available-as-a-library, which in some ways are better.)  Properties in particular are really useful for the evolvability of code; otherwise you have to overdesign up front to avoid a big rewrite as you switch from straight struct fields to accessors.<p>I&#x27;m actually leaning towards Java 8 + Jython 2.7 as I consider what language to write my startup/personal projects in.  Jython 2.7 gives me basically all the language features I actually cared about in Python, and it fixes the Unicode mess that necessitated Python 3.  It has no GIL and solid multithreading support.  The Java layer gives you all the speed of Go and more.  And the interface between them lets you seamlessly use Java within your Jython scripts, so you can easily push code down into the Java layer without having to rewrite your whole product.",1401165265

Any thoughts on the Flash security updates which hit other browsers and bundle Chrome&#x27;s web browser in with it? Or how about the Android contracts with default search placement (and other forms of) bundling baked into them?<p>Google is spending well over a billion Dollars a year on the thesis that your thesis is wrong.<p>>It&#x27;s not a monopoly.<<p>The hell it&#x27;s not. At least if we use <i>any</i> of the <i>standard</i> definitions.<p>>You can use another search engine if you want to.<<p>And while an informed individual may choose to, the majority of people are driven by default settings which are purchased, as per the above.<p>>The site that emailed to get a link taken down employed an SEO agency to improve their rankings and they created a bunch of spammy links to try to manipulate Google into ranking that site higher than others that probably deserve to rank higher due to their content.<<p>Are you suggesting there are not false positives, or that competitors do not buy links to torch their competitors?

Only a person ignorant of the field of SEO would presume this to be true in all cases.<p>>Re, the nofollow aspect. Google didn&#x27;t &quot;force&quot; sites into using the nofollow attribute by scaring them into thinking that their rankings would drop. Nofollow was in place before there was any notion that who you linked to could harm you. Sites like Wikipedia and others were only too happy to add nofollow to links because it put spammers off from crapifying their sites.<<p>This is a complete misunderstanding of history, on numerous levels.<p>Nofollow was introduced as a (ineffective) solution to blog comment spamming. To help aid further/wider adoption, at some point some Googler&#x27;s even suggested things like pagerank sculpting could be useful, up until some large sites started doing it excessively. They were looking for reasons to justify its widespread use, because Google intended from day one that the tag could then be spread onto paid links & other links they didn&#x27;t want to count.<p>And the other level of absolute misunderstanding was that (before Google went on their fearmongering campaign about links) they in the past suggested that you couldn&#x27;t control who links to you, but you could control who you link to & sites which linked to bad neighborhoods could indeed be penalized for it.<p>Very rarely is there a comment which is that long & that wrong.

Done. No need to think about it.<p>Yes, it does break with python2 -- but python2 isn&#x27;t going anywhere.<p>As for the GIL -- is it <i>really</i> such a big deal any more? I know that forking processes on Windows used to be hopelessly slow -- maybe it still is? But it&#x27;s been pretty lightweight on Linux for the longest time -- and as we&#x27;re getting more and more (logical and physical) cores -- with all the cache-coherency issues that come with it -- isn&#x27;t multiprocess a pretty sane programming model?<p>Yes, a solid actor framework would be nice -- but that would also mandate some form of change to python.<p>If there&#x27;s something I&#x27;d like to see, it&#x27;s a clean interface between rust and python (rather than having to fall back to c for high performance code).<p>But I don&#x27;t understand the people that hold up Go as the terrible threat to python -- sure there are a lot of people that will move from one to the other -- but the languages are so different that the comparison really doesn&#x27;t make any sense. The one thing they do have in common is a strong vision and focus on simplicity -- but they articulate that vision and focus quite differently.<p>For those that want &quot;faster&quot; python -- why not use nimrod? If you want something &quot;faster&quot; and &quot;more embeddable&quot; why not use lua? I can&#x27;t see a good pythonX that is better at either of these two in the areas where they excel. If you want actors, why not use Elexir?<p>Personally I&#x27;d probably enjoy a Smalltalk/Strongtalk that had a slightly more complicated syntax than traditional Smalltalk -- borrowing from python (say indentation for blocks, some way to define infix messages/operations) -- but I&#x27;m not under any illusion that such a language would be a <i>better python</i>.",1401163237

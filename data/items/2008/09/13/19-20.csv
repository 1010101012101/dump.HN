303298,comment,302740,302906,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Firstly, not all hackers are founding or interested in founding businesses.<p>Secondly, the difference between the democrats and republicans on the policy towards small business is really not all that different. There are small, honestly insignificant differences in taxes which might be effected. And capital gains isn't exactly on people's minds when they found a business. It's mostly float or sink.<p>But, thirdly, the republicans routinely have the least progressive attitude towards software patent reform, public domain status, copyright reform, and tend to enforce monopolies in, for example, media.<p>Four, Obama embraces technology, has a technology policy, and is altogether seen as progressing away from the old paper bureaucracies.<p>Fifth, a huge number of hackers are from immigrant populations, whose livelyhood is increasingly threatened by  the demand for visas and protectionist immigration and freetrade policies.<p>Finally, for many hackers, questions of economic policy are almost completely irrelevant compared to the promise of a more pacifistic war policy, more widespread civil liberties, and a government that doesn't act as if American citizens, and American citizens alone, are god's chosen people.<p>Many hackers are outsiders, who would bare the brunt of an assault on civil freedoms. Most hackers are familiar with moral reasoning. Most hackers could only get their start by disobeying the system somewhat, and are routinely familiar with doing illegal acts that nonetheless cause no harm. Thus hackers find themselves in opposition to authoritarian structures, and the republicans have, in the public consciousness, been most likely to exercise their might in this manner.<p>(I've only just realized that HN's guidelines contain the admonishment 'no politics')",1221335385

Their competitors have had more open SDKs for <i>years</i> and none of Apple's doomsday scenarios have come to pass.<p>I'm personally hoping that when Adroid comes out with its own app store and open platform, it will finally convince people to stop excusing Apple's behaviour.",1221335292

It is important you avoid getting yourself put in a position where you cannot do that, or end up delivering IP to someone else to monetize. If selling your product ends up being more difficult than they think, will these bail and still demand compensation if YOU pick up the ball they drop and run with it? How serious are they and what signs are they giving you that they deserve equity at this point.<p>If all they are doing is sales, you can set up a commission structure, and tie equity in your issues to the company's hitting successful sales milestones. If these guys want ownership to start, another approach is to license your existing codebase to the new venture. Be sure to get this license down in paper!",1221334787

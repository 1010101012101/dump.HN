I guess the solution would be to build an &quot;offline&quot; mode, but im not quite sure how can i do that or where should i even start, any pointers in the right direction would be appreciated.<p>thanks,

6116824,comment,6116514,6116514,38,0,tikhonj,,,"Basic Emacs lisp is <i>well</i> worth learning. It takes Emacs from being <i>an</i> editor to being <i>your</i> editor.<p>With something like Eclipse, even adding a little bit of functionality is an undertaking. You have to create a project, write a bunch of boilerplate, load it and so on. With Emacs, it&#x27;s basically effortless: a line or two of elisp can do wonders. Sometimes I add functionality by just executing elisp directly (with M-:), without even bothering to put it in a file! It&#x27;s that easy.<p>This has really changed how I work. Now I don&#x27;t think twice about having some throw-away elisp for just one project. Or even just one file! Modifying the editor (in small ways) becomes an action almost as natural as copy and paste. Now Emacs is like a jazz performance, with room for improvisation: never the same editor twice.<p>Emacs is also the perfect development environment for Emacs lisp. (Who would have guessed?) It&#x27;s the most integrated system I&#x27;ve ever seen; there is an intuitive and remarkably consistent link between the lisp code and the editor itself. I usually know how some bit of elisp corresponds to an action and vice-versa. And if I don&#x27;t, the incredible interactive help system is, well, helpful: I can easily look up what function a keybinding calls or what keys are bound to a function. These days, I do it instinctively, without thinking. Throw in Emacs&#x27;s general lisp prowess (paredit is incredible), the ability to randomly evaluate an expression and see the results immediately as well as the ease of inspecting variables and you have a very remarkable environment.<p>15 minutes as the key to all this? There&#x27;s no question! Since you&#x27;re going to be using your editor for <i>years</i>, it&#x27;s well worth 15 hours or 15 days or even 15 weeks. (And since it&#x27;s Emacs, you&#x27;ll end up using it for more than just programming: LaTeX, org-mode, blogging, chatting, email...)<p>Go for it!",1375023056

I subsidize the education of other peoples&#x27; children by paying taxes that fund k-12 education.  I have no children of my own.

Similarly a society that has free, universal healthcare is better than one that doesn&#x27;t.<p>In the current system the U.S. spends around 40% more GDP per year on healthcare than any universal healthcare system and has much lower outcomes than many.

With 25 patients on a service, spending even five minutes on each means each &quot;shift change&quot; would take two hours. So you spend closer to one minute on each, and at that point it&#x27;s easy to miss important details. We are skeptical of the &quot;scientific research&quot; because we&#x27;ve all seen errors made because of poor signout that were not happening before work hours were so restricted.<p>For the record, attending ER shifts at my hospital are closer to 8 hours, and residents do 12 hours.",1375020077

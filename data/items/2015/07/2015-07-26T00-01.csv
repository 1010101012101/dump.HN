Pay is good, and they are willing to have someone that needs to learn some parts, but it is on the opposite side of the country from where you are at.  The owners successfully sold two businesses for large sums and have financial resources most of us can only dream of having so they are not afraid to pay for quality.  They are struggling because our area has some large employers that keep their EE&#x27;s with Software experience very close and guarded so it is hard to pull them away.<p>If there is any interest you can send me an email and I will connect you.

They should at least do some rudimentary fact-checking if only as rudimentary as ECC.  But no, then narratives would die.<p>Either they want to portray the struggle of the meek in the face of the oppressor.  Or they want to forward an agenda.

The problem is that it becomes harder to find things over time (especially for 1 client) and honestly I archive the company&#x27;s I haven&#x27;t done business with in over 12 months, so it was fairly stupid to have year for me.  We store this structure on box too so that we can easily collaborate, we just don&#x27;t store /dev in box.<p>Things under dev are all in git so they are version controlled.<p>It isn&#x27;t perfect for everything but so far it works better than any other I have tried/used so far.

IMO, universities are churning out too many unethical scientists and, for proof, I offer how much money goes into government-related projects (e.g., weapons, surveillance, control). A rational understanding of ethics is needed to reduce the research and funding of the plethora of destructive and control-oriented efforts.

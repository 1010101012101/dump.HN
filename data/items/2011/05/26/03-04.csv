I don't know if you've ever set up a VPS or dedicated server, but you should compare the cost of that to what Heroku charges for the same resources. You'll see a significant difference.<p>Let me put it this way. 1 Heroku Worker (roughly 80-100mb of ram) $36 a month. Now, what can you get for $36 a month? Go look at 6sync.com linode.com webbynode.com prgmr.com. You can easily fit 10 workers in any of them. With this I come to the conclusion you're paying 10 times more than with a quality VPS provider. Sure, you don't have to monitor these processes, and it scales up and down easily, but 10 times more expensive is reasonable? Please. :)<p>Let me tell you what I find reasonable: If you're charging me 10 times more for the same thing, I find it reasonable I shut down my resources when I don't need them so I only pay for what I actually use. Why else would you offer the ability to set the worker quantity via their API?<p>Or how about this: You park your car, you pay for a parking ticket that lasts until the next month. Reasonable? I think not.<p>You should also consider the fact that this could also potentially encourage more people to actually host on Heroku, rather than be scared off by ridiculous pricing at early stages. I'm also not trying to ""disrupt"" their business. If this would greatly affect their business then I'll be damned, and I think I'm not the only one. So don't count on it.",1306382071

Sure the Haskell version of Hello World looks simple but, once you get even a little beyond that example you start having to explain MUCH more complicated subjects such as currying, monads, functors, typeclasses, etc.  Don't get me wrong I love Haskell but it certainly isn't easier to learn then Scala even if the syntax is less verbose.  I don't really get your argument that Scala code does not scale to solve complex problems; I would actually argue that Scala does that very well.

I am the sole technical person and am pretty much responsible for all technology for my library. I actually don't get much of anything done on any given day. But most importantly, I maintain people's confidence in our systems and assuage their fears so that everything continues as normal. I am lying to them half the time (our downtime is almost always unexpected issues in ""the cloud"" and all we can do is wait. When implementing new systems, if I feel they're good, I assume it'll work out and promise success with a hiccup here or there), but it's necessary and important part of keeping us going. Simultaneously, I have developed several apps on the side.<p>I guess the point I am trying to make is that productivity is relative. It's what matters to you and your company. If features are important to your company, then you should be knocking them out. If you're a university with 15,000 students and thousands of full-time employees, not doing much and making sure people still trust you is more important.<p>With that said, I have recently been worried about my skills and have been working hard to be sure I'm keeping fresh.

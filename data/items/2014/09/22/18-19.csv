8351956,comment,8351482,8351804,2,0,aetherson,,,"Yeah, this is more or less right.  Inflation adjustments measure how much you have to spend to consume a given amount -- so, basically, if a loaf of bread costs $0.02 in 1913 and $2.00 in 2014, then inflation is 100x.  With lots of complexity in there as well, of course.<p>Notably, what inflation isn&#x27;t is something like &quot;percentage of total size of the economy.&quot;  So if the economy expands (as it has), then the amount of money available to be made in something that scales to the size of the economy (like the financial markets) increases well beyond the pace of inflation.<p>In 1913, the US population was about 1/3rd what it is now.  The US now plays a much more significant role in the world economy, and of course technological advancement has increased the size of the economy as well.  Inflation doesn&#x27;t account for any of that per se.",1411412391

Here are some reasons our customers find Domino valuable:<p>- Domino makes it really easy to start and manage multiple runs in parallel (think a modern, easy-to-use cluster). If you&#x27;re doing all this directly with AWS, you&#x27;re quickly running into pain points managing all your instances and images.<p>- Domino auto automatically keeps a revisioned history of your work. It supports large files like data sets (which git can&#x27;t handle) and it tracks the results/artifacts of your analysis (which makes it more like git + CI). These things are critical to analytics workflows, rather than pure software development.<p>- Domino lets you deploy your analyses as self-service web UI tools, or deploy them to API endpoints. Doing this on your own would involve building an entire web stack around your analysis.<p>- Domino hosts your analysis centrally so you can share and collaborate with others (yes, this is like github, but on a platform that has all the benefits above).<p>- The entire product can be installed on-premise, so companies can use the functionality described above without going to the cloud if they don&#x27;t want to.<p>Finally, even for pure infrastructure management, we&#x27;ve found that many data scientists don&#x27;t want to spend their time dealing with system administration. It&#x27;s true that it&#x27;s not that hard to start an EC2 instance. But pretty quickly you&#x27;re installing packages (perhaps in an environment you aren&#x27;t used to), dealing with security groups, file transfer (configuring S3), etc. People use Domino for the same reason they use Heroku: yes, you could deal with all that, but it might be a better use of your time to let someone else do it.",1411411807

Most people are taking whatever price they are offered with no push back. No raises this year? Well maybe next year. Maybe a tiny bonus. Etc.<p>Unions had their own set of problems and at some point might be unsustainable, but when people stop negotiating deals, they get taken advantage of.<p>I&#x27;ve changed jobs more than some people I know because it would get me a better deal, and it has. But before that, I experienced myself and watched my parents stick to the same job without getting appropriate raises and bonuses for the work they did.<p>In our current economy the best way to get a raise seems to be to switch companies because companies don&#x27;t like giving raises and people don&#x27;t like asking for them. Eventually what used to be a early raise negotiation will be a yearly job negotiation.  It&#x27;s starting to happen with younger workers and the more that is normal, the less efficient all these businesses will become.<p>All because people stopped negotiating.",1411411749

In the single process model, the attacker could compromise <i>any</i> tab and have all tab state available with no additional effort.  In the multi-process model, the attacker would have to compromise the right tab, compromise a different tab and trick the browser kernel to performing the requisite operations, or somehow bypass the OS&#x27;s memory protection.

8351799,comment,8346240,8350071,1,0,zaroth,,,"Dr. Mu <i>did not</i> received the $117,000 as a private check from Mr Drier.<p>&quot;When Mr. Drier complained to his insurer, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, that he should not have to pay the out-of-network assistant surgeon, Anthem agreed it was not his responsibility. Instead, the company cut a check to Dr. Mu for $116,862, the full amount.&quot;<p>&quot;If the surgery had been for a Medicare patient, the assistant would have been permitted to bill only 16 percent of the primary surgeon’s fee. With current Medicare rates, that would have been about $800, less than 1 percent of what Dr. Mu was paid.&quot;<p>So at least we should agree that this is a perfect example of cost shifting / price gauging.<p>> If the doctor makes $120K/year with Medicare patients only, and $500K/year with only non-Medicare patients, and the hospital is profitable both ways, then where&#x27;s the subsidy? While an extra $380K/year is very lucrative. If what you are saying is true, then, there should be a mass wave of hospitals and doctors which don&#x27;t accept Medicare<p>Well, that&#x27;s the very definition of subsidy, so I don&#x27;t know quite how to respond. Where&#x27;s the subsidy? Right there! Very few people become chief neurosurgeons for $120k per year. A lot more become chief neurosurgeons for $500k per year.<p>As I a said, running a hospital has massive fixed costs, so like an airline, taking on patients which pay 85% of cost is still better for the bottom line, as long as your hospital is running below capacity. So Medicare is an overall good deal for the hospital, even though it pays below cost, as long as it doesn&#x27;t exceed a certain percentage of the overall patient population. If the patient population was entirely Medicare, then the hospital would <i>not be profitable</i>.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s very hard for me to accept that the payment-to-cost ratio chart you linked to is meaningful. That appears to be the average cost across everyone. A better chart would be the cost of Medicare treatment vs. the reimbursement by Medicare, and the same for the private insurers.&quot;<p>The better chart you ask for--the cost of Medicare treatment vs. the reimbursement by Medicare, and the same for the private insurers--is exactly what this chart shows. It shows separately for Medicare, Medicaid, and Private Insurance, what percent of the cost of the procedures is actually paid. Medicare has lately been covering 89% of costs, while private insurance has ballooned to 150% of cost. Here&#x27;s the full set of charts; <a href=""http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/ch4.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aha.org/research/reports/tw/chartbook/ch4.shtml</a><p>> Otherwise, this could be showing that Medicare does a better job of cost containment than private insurers, so that private insurers end up paying for more medically needless but profitable procedures than Medicare.<p>Quite clearly Medicare does a fantastic job of containing <i>its</i> costs. You can strike the &quot;medically needless&quot; part from that, since I think it&#x27;s unsupported. Private insurers absolutely pay for more profitable procedures, as indicated by the chart; private insurance pays 150% of cost overall. But obviously ACA legislation setting a lower payment rate does not inherently make the procedures being paid for actually cost less to perform. But it does certainly force the hospital to search for ways to make up the difference.<p>> Instead, I find papers like &quot;How Much Do Hospitals Cost Shift? A Review of the Evidence<p>I&#x27;m somewhat confused by this paper, since it reads like an op-ed. After a bit a searching, it appears Frakt has quite a few editorials claiming hospitals lack the market power to meaningfully shift costs to private insurers, despite abundant and uncontroversial data showing Medicare pays below cost.<p>Frakt himself has the following to say, quite amusingly, in a editorial titled &#x27;The End of Hospital Cost Shifting and the Quest for Hospital Productivity&#x27;;<p>&quot;The ACA will permanently reduce the Medicare payments hospitals would otherwise receive. Its ‘productivity adjustment’ will scale payments downward by the average rate at which private nonfarm businesses’ productivity increases. That rate has been estimated to be 1.1 percentage points per year…Actuaries for [CMS] have estimated that by year 2040, Medicare payment rates to hospitals will be half those of the commercial market, and lower still thereafter.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s <i>payments rates</i> not total payments. I trust the CMS to know exactly how much it&#x27;s underpaying. <a href=""http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/downloads/2011TRAlternativeScenario.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Stat...</a><p>I didn&#x27;t know that the ACA puts downward pressure on rates equal to the average rate at which private nonfarm business productivity increases. Since that productivity rate increases significantly higher than the historical productivity gains in <i>healthcare</i>, and is expected to do so for some time, CMS states this will require new legislation to fix, or else payment rates will be so low as to significantly effect availability and quality of services. That&#x27;s pretty scary, to have built a failure mode like that into the system.",1411410721

Here&#x27;s the summary:<p>Hedge funds are investment vehicles that have avoided being heavily-regulated because they only accept money from government-certified &quot;accredited investors.&quot; Their investment strategies are secret and unconventional. Some of them deliver floods, while the average one doesn&#x27;t do that well.<p>Hedge funds provide liquidity, which makes it easier to trade; and conduct arbitrage, so that prices are muscled into line before they get totally irrational. (The latter doesn&#x27;t always work though.) Meanwhile, since they have fewer safety nets, hedge funds are more aggressive about monitoring their own risk. They&#x27;re better than banks in that respect, which are much more heavily leveraged and which have a history of being supported by the government when they mess up.

From your referenced blog post:<p><pre><code>   Washington is absolutely correct, in my opinion, to want to boost American consumption, but the Fed seems to be trying to boost consumption by igniting another asset bubble in the hopes that, like before 2007, Americans will feel “richer” and so will consume more. This isn’t sustainable, however, and will leave us, as Paul and Druckenmiller fear, even more heavily indebted and more dangerously exposed to the underlying weakness in demand.\n</code></pre>\nBut to answer your question: the strong public equities market has provided investors with the capital and confidence to plow money into investments in private tech companies.<p>> If you dumped 10,000 employees onto the market in the Bay Area it would probably sort out reasonably quickly.<p>Even if we assume that we&#x27;re looking at just 10,000 people, your assumption that the market will quickly absorb them without much pain is quite optimistic.<p>Companies like Google and Facebook will certainly pick up some of the most skilled folks, but the vast majority of startup employees are not as desirable as many would like to believe, and they won&#x27;t be able to replace their salaries.<p>Put simply, there are 20-something [insert programming language du jour] developers with a few years of experience making $120,000/year plus benefits at unprofitable angel or venture-backed startups who are going to have to face the reality that their six-figure earning potential is completely dependent on the continued inflow of investment dollars to early-stage startups.",1411410286

This is something we learn as we acquire skills, learn about goals, learn how to channel our energies towards meeting said goals, etc.<p>Thus practice is itself a skill that requires practice to develop.<p>Since our practicing of practicing will necessarily not be perfect, we will not be &quot;practicing practicing perfectly&quot;.

8351645,comment,8349579,8351505,3,0,angersock,,,"So, we&#x27;re talking about the various <i>Shock</i> series here, not Mass Effect--I&#x27;m not commenting on them, so let&#x27;s dispense with wasting our time there. Game design is also a matter of opinion, so yeah, that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from, although every thing I mentioned is a plain statement of <i>fact</i> about their design elements.<p>From a design standpoint, removing the inventory and skills system (and replacing it with a clunky plasmids/tonics/hat system) removed the ability to permanently change your character and evolve them, and also to easily temporarily change out your skills and abilities. Cybermodules (skillpoints) in SS2, once spent, never come back. You can&#x27;t respec, and so if you decide to build a melee or stealth character, you really have to develop it.<p>In <i>Bioshock</i>, though, you can switch out components and plasmids and upgrades, and in <i>Bioshock 2</i> you can do much the same--in effect, an extended inventory system like the chests in <i>Resident Evil</i>, and a clunky mechanism to use. The character never undergoes irreversible build changes, and you can&#x27;t just drop into inventory and switch out tonics if they&#x27;re not what you want, like you could in SS2.<p>Speaking of inventory management, there is never a point in <i>Bioshock</i> where hoovering up random shit off the ground is a bad idea, so why even make it an option? It might as well just be an automatic pickup ala <i>Doom</i>. SS2 had things that were junk or weren&#x27;t useful--it was a richer, more interactive world in some ways.<p>In both Bioshock games, you end up with a limited number of weapons to use, wheres in SS2 you can carry around as many or as few as you&#x27;d like, depending on how you decide to allocate your inventory. Weapons in SS2 have more pronounced damage types. Melee weapons in SS2 require a dedicated character build, whereas you can bumble into an endgame-useful game-breaking wrench build very quickly in <i>Bioshock</i>.<p>The removal of text fallbacks for logs in <i>Bioshock</i> made it harder to rapidly review events and piece things together, and overall there were many fewer logs than in SS2.<p>The inability to use stealth to bypass fights and the relative surplus of ammunition meant that cinematic combat was the main workhouse of the <i>Bioshock</i> games, whereas SS2 played more similar to a survival horror RPG.<p>~<p>Those are just some of the things that streamlining of the design did to the games, with the end result that the <i>Shock</i> lineage devolved into fun and competent cinematic shooters. I&#x27;m not saying that they&#x27;re <i>bad</i> games, I&#x27;m saying that their design has regressed so far that it is basically not worth mentioning in the same breath as their predecessors.<p><i>System Shock 1</i>, for what it&#x27;s worth, was an amazing example of design ideas that never got much love, and likely represent another evolutionary dead end. :(",1411408810

For instance, of the group that I used to &quot;roll&quot; with, all but one of us have suffered from a diagnosed depression. It&#x27;s a small sample size, but 9 out of 10 people is somewhat alarming and it&#x27;s not hard to find plenty of examples of people online claiming to suffer from similar symptoms after prolonged MDMA usage.<p>So I&#x27;d temper your recommendation. It&#x27;s still a substance that you need to be very careful with. For one, there are so many other substances that are much more dangerous that are easier to produce and sold as MDMA. If you&#x27;re going to use the drug, make sure you&#x27;re using the actual drug.

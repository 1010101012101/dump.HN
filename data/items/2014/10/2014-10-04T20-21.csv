8410637,comment,8409020,8409486,1,0,BraveNewCurency,,,">  how can software--particularly free software--create jobs?<p>Ok, let&#x27;s take Linux as a specific example.  Take a gander at this: <a href=""http://lwn.net/Articles/547073/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lwn.net/Articles/547073/</a><p>So major companies (Oracle, Red Hat, Google, IBM, Intel, Samsung, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, etc) are contributing to Linux.  That creates jobs for all the kernel hackers who probably started before kernel knowledge was a hot commodity.<p>But that effect is minor compared to what people are building WITH Linux:\n- Red Hat (a 1B company!) wouldn&#x27;t even exist if it weren&#x27;t for Linux. They don&#x27;t &quot;sell Linux&quot;, they sell services around Linux.\n- IBM invested a billion dollars in Linux, and it paid off. They recently decided to invest another billion. Their support for Linux sells Mainframes and their expertise sells services.\n- Google wouldn&#x27;t be able to give away their search engine (over 10 million servers) if they had to pay Microsoft for every server.\n- Companies like TI and Intel can add Linux support for their chips (a tiny expense compared to creating a new CPU), which will enable new devices to be created easily. Some of those new devices (TiVo, Android, Tomato WRT, RPi) will be successful and cause their companies to hire more people.<p>Giving away software doesn&#x27;t compete with programmers -- it only competes with companies that sell software. Only a tiny fraction (maybe 5%?) of programmers work for companies that sell software directly.  The vast majority of programmers write internal line-of-business software, or sell their software indirectly (SaaS).<p>So any Open Source software (Drupal, Apache, etc) is far more likely to help lots of companies save money (therefore have money left over to create jobs).<p>> In fact, for every programming job there may be manual jobs becoming obsolete.<p>That will make programming jobs be more &quot;in demand&quot; compared to regular jobs, therefore command higher salaries.<p>> So what can sustain high hourly rates and create new jobs?<p>You are thinking about it from the wrong end. The question is &quot;can a bit of software be worth millions/billions to a company?&quot;  The answer is clearly &quot;yes&quot;, since we&#x27;ve seen tiny teams create billions in value over and over.<p>Search around for the writings of patio11 on HN. He will open your eyes. People charging $200/hr are playing a different ball game than people charging $20/hr. They are not 10x better, just better at demonstrating the value of their software to the client.<p>> not everyone can become a specialist.<p>Just the opposite. There are so many new technologies and branches of science coming out that <i>everyone</i> will be a specialist in the future.  In fact, programmers are <i>already</i> highly specialized. No matter what technology you pick (COBOL, Java, .NET, Linux, Microsoft, nodejs, Ruby, Python), you will find that some subset of programmers will refuse to work on it because they refuse to learn it.",1412456335

These moving lines are being made-up as people go along, and it&#x27;s almost strictly an issue that exists in the very wealthy first world (ie it&#x27;s invented by people with nothing better to do, who believe they&#x27;re superior to the rest of the planet). The best that can be said is: vegans have arbitrarily created a personal moral line, wherein they are ok with killing plants but not animals. Anything else is just subjective argumentation.<p>And the obvious reason why vegans and others do what they can mentally to avoid facing the plant vs animal hypocrisy, is because if you take that to its logical conclusion, you end up with nutjobs that claim it&#x27;s as evil to kill an ant as a human baby.",1412456192

And so your argument looks like it&#x27;s saying &quot;we don&#x27;t want it to happen to us, therefore it&#x27;s unethical (for anyone to do that to us, or for us to do that to others)&quot;. I know you probably doesn&#x27;t mean it that way.<p>Now, whether it&#x27;s ethical to eat meat itself. As someone else have mentioned, I&#x27;ve always wondered where do you draw the line? Pigs and cows seem obviously out of the questions, but how about cockroach, caterpillar, corepod, hydra[0]? Event certain plants do sense distress signals when they&#x27;re being attacked.<p>Do we actually know that it&#x27;s possible for us, as a society as a whole to survive entirely on non-animal products, food or otherwise? Additionally, even if it might be just historical accident that we have a heavy meat-eating society, and another society that starts out without ever using animal products can advance to where we are right now and have a perfectly functioning society, it doesn&#x27;t mean that it&#x27;s ever feasible to actually switch to such a no-animal product society.

So, I got a\nrespected calculus book, dug in, and learned\nfreshman calculus on my own.

If the net multiplier coefficient on jobs per [technological advance/new business based on technology] is below 1, then the economic system is unstable, as it could trend towards long-term unemployment and revolution (if Marx is to be believed). Of course, due to regulation and human nature, it&#x27;s a damped system - not all jobs will be eliminated.<p>But if that coefficient is above 1, then the system will stabilize. The relevant question here is how, as technology entrepreneurs, we can both (a) create <i>resilient, scalable businesses</i> that individually have a coefficient above 1, and (b) create <i>resilient, scalable systems</i> that promote the creation of those businesses in (a).<p>The difficulty is tying these coefficients to the bottom lines of each of these businesses. I&#x27;m co-founding a startup now that, without delving into specifics, aims to link the value of its core consumer brand with its ability to generate jobs and income. Time (and lots of effort) will tell whether we can (a) make this successful, and (b) whether it can lead our industry as a whole towards seeing the viability of this trend. But I&#x27;m confident that we have a fighting chance to do as much as any single business can to promote the sustainability of human society.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction#Joseph_Schumpeter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction#Joseph_Sc...</a>",1412453994

Again, it&#x27;s not my intention to devalue OP&#x27;s skills and/or experience. What I&#x27;m trying to say is that the hourly rate doesn&#x27;t have much to do with skills or experience but with the economy of the place you&#x27;re located. I.e. why does a developer located in New York City charge more than a developer located in the Philippines? Both can be just as good at their job, it&#x27;s just that &quot;their&quot; costs are different because their local economy is different. Therefore a client located in NYC who approaches a developer in the Philippines will have expectations regarding an hourly rate of that developer. I.e. why would I as a client want to work with someone far far away while I can work with someone face to face for the same cost? The primary reason a client located in NYC who wants to work with someone located in the Philippines will be cost and it&#x27;s the reduction in cost that this developer uses as advantage over developers located in NYC.<p>I believe StackOverflow did a similar thing when they hired developers all over the world.

ICD-9 is widely used in US because Medicare uses it for billing purposes, but it is not considered very good for medical practice and ICD-10 isn&#x27;t much better really. There are better ones like ULMS [1]. And many code sets have some sort of conversion to ICD-9 for billing.<p>The problem though is not really the particular medical code set a hospital uses, but rather medical professionals have to know the codes. Codes are for machines not humans. The doctor should just have to put into the medical record the diagnosis, location in or on the body, etc. The software then figures out the right code and sends the code to another system. Some medical software is built that way, but many medical systems require the input of the code itself. It is analogous to making users remember and enter their UUID rather than their username when they login or making users enter the IP address rather than a domain name.

I think it&#x27;s laughable to worry about an autonomous or remotely piloted drone assassinating people with fragmentation grenades when a normal firearm operated by a human is extremely practical and seems to work well enough. The latter is designed for nearly that exact purpose, and refined over centuries. They&#x27;re cheap, easy to use, easy to get (in some places), and reliable.",1412452976

People in the US will easily pay you 5-6x as much for the same work, and all you have to do is <i>not say where you live</i>.<p>On that note, I second the suggestion to improve your English.

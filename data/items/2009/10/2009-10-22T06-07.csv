A real browser, not some weird WAP enabled thing.  But, that's really irrelevant.  What is relevant is Ballmer's need to keep making stupid comments.  It is like he thinks he can change reality by just saying some weird stuff.<p>Microsoft's looking for its next big thing.  They have executed an awesome series of steps going from Basic -> DOS -> Windows -> Office.  They are a big company and seem to be putting out tons of new products without much success.  The Zune HD might finally be the real deal, but it is a great entrant in a market that is being absorbed by cellphones.  Their stock is stagnant and Apple + Google are getting bigger.  It just seems like Ballmer doesn't really have the vision to take all cool stuff Microsoft is working on and turn it into a new generation of products, so he attacks everything and keeps iterating the old.",1256194426

I am still searching for ideas, and one that came into my mind was artificial neural networks in electronics. I thought it was perfect (mind you I have a very limited knowledge of ANN, so feel free to correct me).Neural networks are mathematical models of brain and if I could implement such a thing,even on a very very small scale, into simple circuits it would definitely result in a very impressive research project.<p>The immediate second thought was that this cannot be original. There has to be some work done on it as this is such an obvious thing. I found out about BEAM robotics and Nv Nets, but as this is still in the research phase there is not much material on it to read.<p>I couldn't find books,post,papers anything which will make me understand Neural Networks from the perspective of an electronics engineer. But I think this could be the mistake of my not-so-good searching skills. Can anyone please point me to such a resource?",1256193825

896307,comment,896274,896282,0,0,10ren,,,"USB 2.0 is 480 Mbit/s (max). I can't find any definite figures for video bandwidth, but I think it would be OK for youtube size, and probably for SD video. Note that since 3D acceleration is done inside the card, it isn't affected by the transfer rate - once it has the textures. Transferring the textures is what takes the bandwidth (assuming the USB card has 3D acceleration).<p>But for command-line stuff, this delay would be undetectable, similar for reading text (like the Kindle, which has extremely low refresh rate), email, web-browing. Probably, most applications - certainly, most business applications - would be OK on it.<p>But USB 3.0 will change all that. What's interesting is this may be a disruptive innovation, and the companies who got into while it was still niche are now set up (they know the technical problems, customer technical and business issues; and they have market presence, with end-user customers and retailers etc). That's how you win with a disruptive innovation.<p><i>EDIT</i> a review <a href=""http://www.everythingusb.com/iogear_usb_2.0_external_video_card_12787.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.everythingusb.com/iogear_usb_2.0_external_video_c...</a>",1256193626

896288,comment,896113,896251,0,0,btilly,,,"Um, I think you missed the point.  After encountering a challenge the group that was initially praised for brains saw their performance drop on problems <i>that should have been within their skill level</i>.  The group that was initially praised for effort saw their performance improve after that same challenge.<p>The moral is simple.  When you praise children, you motivate them to seek more praise.  If your praise is about something that is out of their control, such as innate intelligence, you discourage them from trying to take control of their circumstances.  But if it is within their control, such as effort, they apply energy in a useful direction.<p>If you're a parent, which would you prefer to do?",1256191802

And that disagreement is that you're training kids to work hard, but not necessarily well.  In my childhood the messages we got pushed us to always look for the trick.  As an adult I really value the mental habit of always looking for the shortcut that makes things easy.<p>Another interesting variant I find myself using with my son is to compliment him for showing smarts, but follow it up with a theory that brains need practice to continue working.  Thus ""smart"" becomes a compliment for what he does, and not what he is.  For instance I'll say something like, ""How did you get so smart?  You must have been really using that brain!

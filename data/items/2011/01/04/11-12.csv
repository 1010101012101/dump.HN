That's important, and the title doesn't even hint at it.<p>tl;dr - Someone is suing someone else and issuing copyright takedowns to Linden Labs since they are hosting the content.  Judge apparently didn't think they had much of a case and ordered Linden not to comply.  Article thinks this is a violation of Linden's rights and should be allowed to take it down if they want.<p>Personally, I do see the rights issue.  It could have been worded better, I think...  At least given Linden the option to ignore it, instead of forcing them.  But the judge is trying to protect the rights of the defendant, and said defendant would be losing money if Linden complied.  (Linden loses money as well since it takes manpower to comply, but it also takes manpower to ignore the takedown request.  If Linden has streamlined their takedown process, I think it unlikely they have a section for Judges' orders of negation.)",1294142337

Saying that ""not everyone you like will be attracted to you"" is a very nice way of putting it. In my experience, most people are attracted to stupid things. I've tried the classical ""acting like a charming douchebag"" routine, and I've been horrified at the rate of success in the traditional meat markets.<p>The point is that dating outside of your social circle is a numbers game. You will be seeing the averages most of the time, and most people are simply not worth your time. At least that's the impression I've been left with after playing around with this stuff in different places the last year.<p>As to whether playing games like this is pointless or not...if you're looking for the love of your life, then probably yes. But if you're looking for sex and short-term, uncommitted relationships, games like these are the best way to get what you want! I see this as just a natural extension of all the phoniness that happens in night clubs. The point is, playing games works! You'd be horrified at how many women, especially under 30, treat dating as a game..and have the most stupid reactions as a result. These people are probably not worth investing too much time in, but they do represent the average person you will meet.

I spend very little of my programming time struggling with those issues, even in languages without generic types.<p>Rob Pike seems to be doing a kind of programming unlike what most developers do. I fill, empty, filter and analyze values in containers all the time, and I suspect I'm not the only one.<p>> C++ programmers don't come to Go because they have fought hard to gain exquisite control of their programming domain, and don't want to surrender any of it. To them, software isn't just about getting the job done, it's about doing it a certain way.

These two axes are not totally independent (arguably say, the verbosity of java for example, decreases its value on the practicality scale) but they're weakly related.<p>Having a toolkit like QT makes C++ a vastly superior choice to go for a desktop application, <i>despite</i> the fact that C++ lies somewhere on the dark depths of hell on the 'Zen' scale.<p>What I was saying, and agreeing with the OP on, is: Pick your tool for your problem.<p>In some cases, that's Go. In some its C++. In some it might be java; but not having all those tools lying around that people can pickup to use is a major failing for go.<p>...and sure, that'll change eventually I'm sure; but it's an entirely valid complaint <i>right now</i>",1340693049

What if the strategy (integrated vs. non-integrated) matters a lot less than how well it is executed?<p>Maybe the reason the ""integrated approach"" is winning is really that Apple is winning, and the reason Apple is winning is simply that they are executing better than their competitors.<p>As several others have pointed out, the non-integrated approach kicked Apple's ass in the PC market for years. I think that is simply because Microsoft, Intel, and their hardware partners executed better than Apple. Dell made a better computer than Apple and they did it faster and cheaper too, and marketed it extremely well. Of course they won.<p>Today with the iPad, it is Apple who is designing a better product, managing the supply chain to make it faster and cheaper, and marketing it extremely well. Their supply chain is so good that [HP could not even get their hands on equivalent parts to build a competitor.[1]<p>So I think Microsoft can try to go integrated with Surface...it won't matter until they make it better, faster, cheaper than the iPad.

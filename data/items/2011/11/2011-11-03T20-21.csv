A few terms like C++ and C# are special-cased, and a hyphen usually works, but mostly you just can't search for anything punctuation-related for programming.  I was recently trying to learn the difference between the <%= and <%# tags in ASP.NET and Google couldn't even understand the query.<p>Not that it's an easy problem.  How are the spiders and indexers supposed to distinguish ""true?"" as a programming lexeme versus just an interrogative sentence that ends with ""true""?<p>Sometimes we forget that Google and the other search engines aren't a byte-for-byte search across the entire web.  The pages are all tokenized and indexed, with most punctuation dropped since that is indeed the more common usage case.  You don't want a search for a word to miss out on pages where the word was glued to quotes or a comma or something.",1320353902

Feelings do.<p>Apple has done a magnificent job of creating loyal converts based on feelings. Their devices have traditionally been behind Android on a number of features (but always catch up later) because they focused on making people <i>feel</i> like they could accomplish the tasks they wanted to.<p>Android goes about adding features that are super coolnewawesometrendy and they give it to you right away and it's your job to jump in and learn how to use it. Apple will slowly introduce you to new concepts even if it means limiting functionality. The Android and iOS approaches are both valid but one is better for my mother while the other is better for me.<p>So when we talk about the back button on Android maybe we're missing the point? Maybe instead of discussing whether the button is inconsistent or not we should be talking about how to make the entire OS <i>feel</i> like it helps you get what you want to do done. I don't have all the answers but I do know a few of the right questions.<p>Assuming you give someone an Android phone or tablet who has no previous experience or expectations...
How do you make the button feel like its consistent?
What is the intent of someone pressing the button?
How will the action of the button fit in with the rest of the user experience?
How can we get users to know what to expect after a single use of the button?
Is the button even necessary? Was the decision to include this button made because of preconceived notions such as how phones used to function before touch screens?<p>This might be a tad bit off topic but I feel like these ideas are a natural next step in the discussion.",1320353201

While I'm alright at appearing confident when needed, I would self-describe as shy, and I'm definitely not the classic outgoing, charming extrovert that fits the ""cocky jerk entrepreneur"" stereotype. Instead, I'm introverted, focused, generally try to avoid confrontation, and find many small talk networking situations quite stressful. And yet, now on my third company, I'm doing quite well.<p>And I know many other successful entrepreneurs - and I meet more every week through my work at GrantTree - and the best ones are not at all jerks. Some of them are outgoing extroverts, others are more withdrawn, but a quality they all tend to have is that they're friendly, approachable, polite, etc.<p>Now, Steve Jobs and Zuckerberg are really exceptions, I don't think you can base a general rule on them, but even Steve Jobs, if you want to take him as an example, made a very clear commitment to focus on his family. He had only 2 things to focus on: his family and Apple. I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have reviewed contracts while having dinner with his wife. His entire attention and razor-sharp focus would be on her.<p>I'm reminded of something an Accenture partner I once worked with said. He liked working in financial services consulting because many people in the workplace are either competent and assholes, or nice people but incompetent, and he felt that either one without the other is unacceptable.<p>Whether or not that's true of FS consulting, I think it's true in general: just because you're really busy changing the world doesn't justify turning into an asshole.

The convenience of having all of your developers sitting in one room with you often leads to laziness and sloppy project management.  When the customer service guys can approach an in-house developer immediately with a bug a customer reported, sometimes the bug gets fixed, committed, and deployed right away with no documentation.  This makes for a great experience for that customer, and management can pat themselves on the back and call their team ""agile"" but imagine the alternative scenario.<p>Say that customer service rep has to create a detailed bug report with screenshots and steps to reproduce the error, and in the middle of the night (because of timezones) your outsourced dev fixes the bug and completes a post-mortem to close the ticket before committing and deploying.  This leads to more organized processes, better documentation, etc.",1320351997

it's impossible to quantify exactly how much privilege any one person possesses.<p>For instance, I (white, male, college-educated, Sagittarius) am offered a job
at a hot SV startup. According to the theory of privilege, I should credit my race and
background in having at least some part in that accomplishment. But how am I to know how much of the job offer was because of my ""privilege"" and how much was because I was actually the best candidate?

They don't just automatically know that I want to edit ~/Documents/blah.txt. Ditto for the unarchivers and video players. I'm not certain why the browsers are listed, but they're in the same boat for local files (perhaps opening a file:/// url typed in the address field would be broken, but double clicking a local html file or using their Open features would still work).<p>User interaction must happen at some point, otherwise the apps have no clue what files to open.<p>Xcode (and BBEdit's and TextMate's project features) and Dropbox are interesting cases. Dropbox can presumably ask for permission once for each directory the user wants to sync. It does, after all, already use a NSOpenPanel when the user asks to change the sync location. It remains an open question whether it can permanently persist that user-granted exception indefinitely. [1]<p>Xcode is special because opening a project will be a user-specific action, but then each referenced file will somehow need to be opened. There is no solution I'm aware of for that use case. If you're a developer in a similar boat, I strongly suggest filing a radar explaining how your app is broken by the lack of such a solution. I bet the BareBones crew is already working their WWDR contacts, making their needs clear...<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/308884-sandboxing-and-file-references.html#308916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cocoabuilder.com/archive/cocoa/308884-sandboxing-...</a>",1320350742

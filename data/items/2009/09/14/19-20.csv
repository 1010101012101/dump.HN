Both from private sellers so they didn't take debit cards.<p>I use my debit and credit cards all day. I never even use cash, primarily so that it all gets categorized automatically by Mint and I'm too lazy to do it for cash by hand.<p>But in my mind a debit card is the same as checks.<p>Of course I pay my bills online and have bank access online (you must to use Mint).<p>The difference I guess is that I'm using multiple companies. Why load up Bank of America, Vanguard, WSFS, Wachovia, Capitol One and Fidelity's websites and use 6 different interfaces on 6 different websites when I can use one unified one?<p>You seem to have an anti-US bias that you think we are stupid or something. It is a question of how you treat your money, not the tools available.<p>And you are horribly mistaken on the ""burden of filing your own taxes"", which again, has nothing to do with Mint. 99% of the work for taxes is done by the HR department at your office and by a tax accountant.

But the square/rectangle example doesn't do it for me.<p>1 - ""There are actually several problems here. Thread safety is one, but let’s assume the class doesn’t need to be thread-safe.""<p>The Rectangle implementation has a thread issue without regard to the Square subclass:<p><pre><code>   public double getPerimeter() {\n    return 2*width + 2*height;\n  }\n</code></pre>\n2 - ""In object oriented programming, it is necessary that a subclass be able to fulfill the contract of its superclass. In this case, that means the square has to respond to setHeight() and setWidth() calls. However doing so enables the square to violate the nature of a square. A square cannot stand in for a rectangle.<p>You can try to work around this by overriding the setHeight() and setWidth() methods. For example, one might call the other:...<p>However this is fundamentally unsatisfying because there is no reasonable expectation that calling one of setHeight() on a Rectangle object will also invoke the setWidth() method or vice versa.""<p>This is where things unwind.  It is perfectly expected that calling setHeight() on a Square will also change its width.<p>3 - ""We could instead just forbid setHeight() and setWidth() completely by throwing UnsupportedOperationException""<p>Yep, you could do that and it does show you are doing more work in working around using Square as a subclass of Rectangle.  So either don't subclass it or accept the fact that its perfectly normal that if you have a Square, changing either its width or height will effect the other.<p>The author is trying too hard here.  Its decent writing and a good attempt to show how subclassing can lead to unintended consequences.  But this is not a great example.",1252957741

822461,comment,822354,822354,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Computer programming is young enough as a field that the mainstream hasn't realized it isn't possible to fit everything into one unified taxonomy. (Biologists and librarians have both spent over a century trying, and they have a lot of insight on the matter.) Putting types into a hierarchy is a useful abstraction sometimes, but there's not some Grand Truth in it -- often, attempts at cramming disparate elements into a hierarchy just create extra complexity. Most systems will keep trying to turn back into graphs unless you anchor the hierarchy in a specific context (what does 'a IS-A b' mean, really?), and the context tends to shift with the problem definition.<p>Worse still, it's the sort of complexity that <i>looks like work</i>, even though it's usually more like <i>flailing in quicksand</i>.<p>I think not having to deal with class hierarchies is a big reason why some people find dynamically-typed languages so freeing. I'm still kind of new to Erlang, but I think its push towards modeling things via a graph of communicating processes, with a relatively flat type structure, is worth considering as an alternative. It explicitly focuses on the message protocol between actors, rather than a tree of subtypes. Granted, I haven't worked a large enough project to see it break down and get ugly yet. (C++ style OO sounds good on paper, too.)<p>Regardless, it isn't classes per se that lead to OO's problems, but the tendency to overuse inheritance. Among statically-typed languages, Haskell's typeclasses seem like another good solution - they break the hierarchy of inheritance up into composition of properties.<p>Also, the late-binding in OOP means that any class can potentially be responsible for maintaining its invariants even after any of its methods has been overridden by <i>any possible future subclasses.</i> That's not necessarily true even with dynamically-typed languages.",1252957649

I don't want to make a mess of my classes by refactoring code to a distinct method if it doesn't belong in a distinct method.<p>2) Initializers. You wind up writing 3-6 different init methods, and then have to write 3-6 different class method short-cuts so you don't have to write '[[[Class alloc] initWithEverything: everything] autorelease]' everywhere.<p>3) Repeating myself. All the time. Why do I have to write header files? Java, C#, F#, OCaml, Python, Ruby -- none of them require me to duplicate my interface and implementation in two places.

However,  the Mac runtime doesn't support this — so by doing this, you're limited to only testing on a physical device (iPhone or iPod directly). Stick this class into a .m and compile it in Xcode targeting your iPhone and the Simulator respectively:<p><pre><code>  @interface Foo : NSObject {\n  //	id bar; // Only required on Mac runtime or if you want to use the iPhone Simulator\n  }\n  @property (nonatomic, retain) id bar;\n  @end\n  \n  @implementation Foo\n  @synthesize bar;\n  - (void) doSomethingWithBar {\n  	self.bar = @""baz"";\n  	NSLog (@""%@"", self.bar);\n  }\n  @end\n</code></pre>\n@synthesize is useful to have because, well, what if you want @dynamic?<p>As for the rest of the verbosity?

3752119,comment,3751926,3751926,2,0,fruchtose,,,"It sounds like you've had a great post-education career! Keep it up! That said, as a current senior undergraduate computer science major, I still think that college is an invaluable resource, or at the very least post-secondary classes. Working is great--it teaches you skills for working with others, how to use tools, and how to live in the real world. But education is not necessarily those things.<p>Go to college if you want not just a technical background, but theoretical grounding in ideas. I'm not going to college because I want to learn how to write code in JavaScript. (I learned that on my own time.) Introductory classes may do that (Arizona State gives you Introduction to Java as a freshman CS course), but nearly all my other computer science classes have been about just that--computer science. Computer science is not programming. It's applied mathematics. Computer science teaches you not only what is possible through computing, but how to judge ideas about computing and how to apply computing through computers.<p>Again, college is not a necessity. If you don't need it for your career, I have absolutely no objection to that. However, I'm incredibly grateful for the education college has provided me. (Make all the Arizona State jokes you want, but we have a fine CS department.) Computer science gives students an engineering toolset. Programming is not engineering; rather, programming is accomplished through engineering. This is why I believe in college for programmers; good programmers are engineers, first and foremost.",1332665932

I've been using callback-style programming in many applications, ranging from IRC bots to application servers and whatnot. I've also been playing around with Go for several months and tried very hard to implement something that is inherently asynchronous. I gave up after about two months, I just couldn't get used to the concurrency model. I always end up with either data races, deadlocks and have otherwise no good overview of the program logic. This is exactly what the article describes, and seems to apply to me as well.<p>Incidentally, while figuring out how to implement something inherently asynchronous in Go I looked at some IRC client implementations, and noticed how all of those used callback-style programming one way or another. That doesn't inspire much confidence. :(<p>All in all, I am not sure yet whether this is purely due to my inexperience with concurrent programming or whether I am just inherently incompatible with it.

I wish you the absolute best.<p>I do, however, wonder how much of the backlash against college is coming from liberal arts majors that ran up crazy debt while earning a degree that doesn't immediately lead to high paying work. I did a lot of the same sort of things the OP is talking about when I was his age (it was 14 years ago, though, so there were some differences, but it was similar), and I managed a college course load. I graduated in 2003 without debt (state school, didn't go crazy on the weekends, worked hard), and while I would have loved to have the extra time that you have now, over the last decade having a degree (even a silly BA Political Science like I have) has been really, _really_ useful. Most of the jobs I've had since graduation wouldn't have even looked at my resume without that degree on it.<p>Things are changing and it's becoming easier to show off your skills without a piece of paper proving that you meet some university's curriculum requirements, but given the relatively low real costs of a college education, I'd be hard pressed to recommend anyone not get one.",1332665073

However, that, combined w/your review, combined w/the complexity I see every time I view a profiled call stack of a ZF app in KCacheGrind, really make me want to start rolling my own framework.  I've done just that w/my JavaScript, and I'm loving the net positive in simplicity and speed.  The growing complexity of ZF makes me want to go that direction with my PHP code as well (though I'll probably look at simpler frameworks first, like Lithium) .<p>In regard to the following line of ZF2 code cited in the post ...<p>$message = $this->getRequest()->query()->get('message', 'foo');<p>That line in ZF1 would look like ...<p>$message = $this->_getParam('message', 'foo');<p>Not much of a difference, but I wonder what was wrong w/ZF1's less verbose alternative?",1332663818

Maybe someone can offer some advice on my related plight?<p>I'm like many of you in the sense that I spend all day every day on my computer -- I work in security, and I'm introverted.  At the same time, I do crave interaction, and I find that going to bars in my college town provides me with social stimulation (I don't talk to Jersey Shore airheads).  However, as I am also a night owl, this is basically my only social interaction for the day:  the day doesn't seem complete unless I've talked to people.  Therefore, I have become an alcoholic, which has profoundly affected me psychologically, and it's beginning to affect me physically as well.<p>The obvious solution to this problem is to find forms of socialization that don't involve alcohol.  But that's easier said than done:  what should I do?  I have no hobbies and few other interests that don't involve books.<p>Real advice would be appreciated.  Thanks.",1332662647

Have you heard of the 'gap year' idea, which is common in England/Australia? (maybe other places too, but that's where I'm familiar with it). Many people argue that there are cool things you can do at 18 before you go to college, which will then give you some more experience in the world to decide whether you need college, and how you could most gain from it. Personally I'm a big fan of all high school grads being able to take at least a year off before college to learn a bit more about life, it's great that you have taken this opportunity.

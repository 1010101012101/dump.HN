573238,comment,572932,572932,0,0,triplefox,,,"To answer in sort of a roundabout way, I think the problem domain matters a lot for how much you relatively learn when switching languages.<p>With web app backends, for example, most of the problems somehow relate to difficulty maintaining state over widespread, always-on networked systems - things like authentication, sessions, concurrency, large-scale, flexible datastores. So the systems architected gradually get more and more tuned towards serving this particular goal with little programmer effort. And because those problems are a good match to functional programming - because it eliminates state - functional has become popular.<p>But if you were building an embedded system, statefulness is less of a problem: there's usually only one thread, and all memory can be mapped in an orderly way. Your performance constraints are reliant on a single fixed platform, so the methods of inspecting and debugging code change.<p>So to get back to the original question, think about reframing your familiar problems in a way that would <i>simplify</i> the solution with a functional technique. Preferably, look for simplifications that are really big changes and throw out traditional assumptions - the use of relational databases in webapps is one common target for this. Even if you get it wrong you'll get a better understanding of where the functional solution can and can't work.",1240357958

573209,comment,572932,572932,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"For Lisp, I found using Scheme and reading The Little Schemer and SICP more helpful than PCL. I've also been using and heavily customizing Emacs, but Emacs Lisp is kind of a crappy Lisp, and keeping track of its idiosyncrasies while also learning Scheme or Common Lisp's will probably be really confusing initially. Scheme is also a lot more my style than CL, though. YMMV.<p>I also found learning OCaml to be a real eye-opener, both for learning FP techniques (it emphasizes a different set of them than Lisp) and how to work with, rather than against, static typing. (_The Little MLer_ helped, as well, and is <i>at least</i> as good for learning types as _The Little Schemer_ is for recursion, IMHO. Highly recommended.)<p>There's not a whole lot of material published in English on OCaml (the Joshua Smith book is terrible!), but there's a translation of a French O'Reilly book online (<a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/oreilly-book/</a>), and it's quite good for learning the main ideas. The first few chapters are on functional programming, imperative programming, and then their relative strengths & when to use each. (Their emphasis on using FP when appropriate, rather than treating it as the new <i>best thing ever</i>, suggests more insight to me than the blind enthusiasm for languages that tends to cycle through here and reddit.)<p>Also: OCaml is not without its flaws. In particular, its errors can be cryptic, and it's standard library has some infuriating omissions. The language is fantastic for some kinds of problems (ML's forte is anything involving complex data structures), though, and it's a great way to learn some very useful techniques.",1240356519

Learn Lisp, and 2. create a web app startup.<p>Both are very worthy goals, but I don't know if using Lisp, Haskell or erlang to write a web app is really a great idea right now.  (Sorry PG). I think that is was true that writing web apps in Lisp probably gave you a huge leg up against the competitors in the mid 90's.  I don't really know if that's the case now.<p>Languages like Python and Ruby have tons of libraries, frameworks and documentation that really help you get productive making web apps. That's a huge plus in my book.<p>Then again, maybe you're interested in rolling your own libraries and framework ala arc.  If that's your thing go for it.   I'm sure you'll learn a lot along the way.",1240355477

I can't help it that this is hard, but that's the only even remotely practical solution that isn't a false sense of security.

In some respects, it makes sense that those who want other, similar kinds of intellectual property protections be subject to the same requirements.

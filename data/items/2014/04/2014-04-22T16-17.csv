7628828,comment,7625464,7625749,1,0,rdl,,,"The biggest solution I could see would be allowing more in-house groups to work on projects <i>without</i> huge stigma if they fail.<p>The success rate for external/contracted projects isn&#x27;t actually as high as you&#x27;d want, but it&#x27;s generally more politically acceptable for something like that to fail, plus the contractor absorbs some of the de-risking up front in evaluating the bid.<p>I&#x27;d prefer if government had more in-house projects rather than contracting, on the explicit assumption that some of the projects (even most of them!) would be failures -- I don&#x27;t see a big problem with duplicated work at the early stages, then internal-to-government competition to find the best solution, then rolling it out.<p>A side benefit of this would be making GS employment more attractive to great people -- it already pays well, is very stable, has great EoE, etc.  If I were a minority/female/etc. engineer, and I wanted a workplace with minimal discrimination, government would be a great place -- historically, it was one of the first major employers of black people in white-collar roles in the 1960s-1980s.<p>The other key area would be an increase in off-the-shelf products, vs. custom implementations, and focusing on off the shelf systems which are commodity.  Government is actually quite efficient at purchasing certain classes of items -- GSA gets good prices for &quot;anything someone in 1940 could explain&quot;.

No one cares about after-the-fact focusing as Lytro has always presented it.<p>A consumer novelty / gimmick won&#x27;t sell hardware when there are already plenty of smartphone apps that will let you take and share photos in a gimmicky way.<p>If you want everyday consumer use, make a better camera for taking pictures and video of pets and kids.  Make the camera that doesn&#x27;t stop to focus.  Make the camera with one button you hold down to open the shutter, and the camera does the rest (you can select the best shot later).  You have to be better than a smartphone camera app, which is hard because smartphone photography is getting very, very good.  Camcorders and GoPros in the $500-$1000 range are also very, very good.  You&#x27;d have to be cheaper and more convenient with similar or better quality.<p>If you want professional use, you&#x27;ll have to talk about the optics and image quality, or at least the artistic qualities of the result.  Your software should fit into the pro&#x27;s pipeline and produce a unique result of lasting value.  The hardware can be expensive if necessary to meet this goal.<p>Just my two cents.",1398185863

The one thing I&#x27;m having difficulty taking away from it all is what to do about it. I work for a big company, been here for a decade, have become &quot;The Guy&quot; for two major product lines and have never really had a Team. In a decade I&#x27;ve done two...yes two projects. Each one all written by me, application code, kernel drivers, building a root file system. Hundreds upon hundreds of hours generating thousands and thousands of lines of code. I&#x27;m bored because I&#x27;m given a project and because they will not fund additional heads (I&#x27;d love just one but really should have 3 or 4) these projects take 3-5 years to complete. The beginning is interesting but after a few months it comes down to &quot;Implement these 200 API calls&quot; which gets old really really fast.<p>At a startup there are tons of tasks to get done and not enough people so you can easily jump from one area of the company to another. Your manager can say &quot;Joe is getting board doing X, but Y needs to be done and its completely different.&quot; But what do you do when your job doesn&#x27;t have other areas for you to jump to? We have different areas of the business but at this point I&#x27;d have to take a demotion to move...or become a manager and not code anymore.<p>I guess I&#x27;ve got more of a gripe than an actual comment. And I know a lot of people post about startups and small companies where change can actually occur. Sucks that I have to give up stability to get interesting work.",1398185844

Coolest, most thrilling project I tried in school (messy, too).<p>Note: blender wiring can catch fire if they are loaded for extended periods of time (don&#x27;t underestimate the inertia), but old blenders work fine for at least a few minutes. Lego Technic works great, but only with really solid cross bracing. I recommend building a barricade around it (World Book volumes work nicely).<p>Edit: I should note that it did work.

Like OP, I am/was primarily a Python developer. Like OP, my first Go project was a time-sensitive rewrite[0] of a project from Python (tornado) to Go.<p>Even though I was an experienced Python developer, the Go rewrite was marginally (~20%) faster[1]. But the real benefit came from the <i>subsequent</i> development - refactoring, rearchitecting, and maintaining the project on an ongoing basis. Go was designed to make it easy to scale the maintenance[2] of software, and on this one axis, it absolutely blows every other language and environment I&#x27;ve used out of the water.<p>For a fresh project, I&#x27;d say Go is about 10% slower to write than the equivalent Python[3] for the average case. But the time/cost savings are <i>very</i> quick to come thereafter.<p>[0] I would absolutely not recommend doing time-sensitive rewrites in general, but that decision was a separate matter.<p>[1] Some of this is due to the nature of rewrites in general, but the fact that it wasn&#x27;t slower to use a language I&#x27;d never used before says something about the language.<p>[2] Scaling software development as teams grow is <i>very</i> different from scaling software as users grow.<p>[3] Assuming comparable familiarity with both languages, which is rarely the case, of course",1398185676

But it&#x27;s not good entertainment (again, arguably excluding the podcasts), and it&#x27;s not good educational material. For anyone. Even kids.<p>I quickly pulled up<p><a href=""http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/death-dying/death-by-hanging.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://health.howstuffworks.com/diseases-conditions/death-dy...</a><p>This particular article is about how hanging works. You can cite this article. There&#x27;s a button beneath the infinite scroll that gives you a citation slug. The implication here is that the material on How Stuff Works is worth citing. It&#x27;s not.<p>The article itself cites three sources. The links to two are broken, and the third is to an ABC News journalism piece that, in connection with the hanging of Saddam Hussein, spends a few paragraphs talking about the physics of hanging. This is a news piece and, as such, doesn&#x27;t cite any sources itself.<p>So is what this how stuff works article about how hanging works really how hanging works? Fucked if I know. Now that I&#x27;ve read the article and checked the sources (or really, the one non-defunct, non-source), I still have to do the leg work to go track down more authoritative, primary sources.<p>That means (instinctively), going to wikipedia (which I could have done initially, skipping the whole HSW excursion) and tracking down sources there. Or doing whatever else that has proven reliable in the past. Encyclopedias. Journals. Whatever.<p>This is true about HSW for kids, as well -- though I&#x27;m not sure whether to a slightly lesser extent, or to a <i>much greater</i> extent. The question there being one of pedagogy: is teaching how citations work and what they imply important (or not) early on?<p>Yes, my wife and I (infrequently) enjoyed the Stuff You Should Know and Stuff Mom Never Told You podcasts... but I always found it odd that the podcasts were tertiary to the whole HSW content thing, and what the hell is the deal with that?<p>/off-the-cuff ramble",1398185615

7628771,comment,7623291,7625778,1,0,munificent,,,"I came up with the same thing a while back. I was hacking on a side-scroller and spent a <i>lot</i> of time trying to get the feel right. The detailed explanation:<p>To start a jump, the user presses the jump button while the character is standing. There is a &quot;grace period&quot; where you can still jump if the character isn&#x27;t on the ground <i>now</i>, but was a few frames ago. This is important to be able to jump right as the character reaches the edge of a platform. Without this, you have to jump earlier than you feel you should.<p>Once a jump has started, we track how long the jump button has been held down. Every frame, the character&#x27;s Y velocity is modified by the &quot;jump acceleration&quot;. This acceleration starts at some high value, and ramps down linearly the longer the jump button is held down.<p>For example, the first frame of jumping may add -10 to velocity, then -8, -6, -4, -2, until finally zero. I found this acceleration ramp was the key to getting the jump to feel snappy yet responsive. The first frame gives the biggest velocity boost, so the character immediately leaps into the air. Then later frames give a diminishing effect so that you can more precisely dial in how much oomph you want the jump to have.<p>Gravity is then applied on top of this. In code, it looks like:<p><pre><code>    // Start jump.\n    if ((Actor.LastOnGround <= JumpAllowedFrames) && UserInput.JumpHeld) {\n      jumpFrames = 1;\n    }\n\n    // Accelerate upwards while holding jump button.\n    if (jumpFrames > 0) {\n      velocity.Y -= JumpSpeed * (MaxJumpFrames - jumpFrames) / MaxJumpFrames;\n\n      if (!UserInput.JumpHeld) {\n        // Stop accelerating if player releases button.\n        jumpFrames = 0;\n      } else if (jumpFrames >= MaxJumpFrames) {\n        // Can only accelerate for so long.\n        jumpFrames = 0;\n      } else {\n        // Keep jumping.\n        jumpFrames++;\n      }\n    }\n\n    // Apply gravity.\n    velocity.Y += Physics.Gravity;\n</code></pre>\nI was really happy with how this turned out. Actually, now that I dig into this several-year-old code, it kind of makes me want to resurrect the project. :)",1398185538

I was merely pointing out that the GP&#x27;s conclusions are probably incomplete, given the data we have on lead.<p>Most of my previous comments were quite non-committal. For instance, the phrase &quot;lead-soil levels seem to have some negative effect&quot; was cherry-picked for your analysis, and given much stronger meaning than intended. First, let&#x27;s examine the word choice of &quot;seem&quot;. It means &quot;give the impression or sensation of being something or having a particular quality.&quot; This modifies the statement, to imply that the data &quot;gives the impression&quot; that there is &quot;some negative effect&quot;. This is a much weaker statement than a hypothesis on the effect of lead-soil levels on poverty-stricken neighborhood. Perhaps, that statement would have been more clear if written as, &quot;lead-soil levels seem to have an effect <i>on crime</i>&quot;. The implication from the sentence that follows is that the value of &quot;some&quot; is &quot;crime&quot;.<p>It very well could be that lack of political power caused lead-producing activities to be concentrated in low-income neighborhoods. However, the issue at hand is not that lead-soil levels cause poverty; it&#x27;s that lead-soil levels increase the incidence of crime. This point may not have been clear, as conceded above.<p>Indeed, correlation does not imply causation, but we know much about the health effects of lead [1] and its impact on decision making. We know that the correlation of crime rates with increasing and decreasing lead-levels, in a variety of situations, throughout many policies and governments, holds. We know both a pathway and have a strong correlation. Dismissing this as happenstance is unwise.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Health_effects"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead#Health_effects</a>",1398185402

So my need for a further explanation is because &quot;in large data sets large deviations happen more often&quot; does not appear to address my question if I&#x27;m specifically asking why volume would cause more spurious correlations (in fact, it does not). My questions are admittedly vague as well, but this should clear up my confusion.<p>I&#x27;m not saying the author doesn&#x27;t know what spurious correlation is, just that the author used the term incorrectly, or too vaguely to be called correct, in that instance.

It&#x27;s known as layering or spoofing and like any behavior where you&#x27;re placing orders to influence others rather than out of an interest to trade, it&#x27;s illegal.<p>Most cases of this or similar behavior like stop running have involved human traders at loosely regulated click trading shops or smaller electronic firms that don&#x27;t play by the rules:<p><a href=""https://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2012/P178687"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2012/P178687</a><p><a href=""http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6649-13"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr6649-13</a><p>Aside from the regulatory risk, it doesn&#x27;t fit the business model for most &quot;HFT&quot; firms, who generally are making many low-risk, low-reward trades with a small statistical edge based on proprietary models.

If you are fast enough to make markets or arb crude oil, you can make way more doing that than manipulating the DOM hoping to push algos into doing something stupid until they figure your tricks out.<p>Predicting markets is hard.

I&#x27;m skeptical, for several reasons.<p>* The saying goes that &quot;A&#x27;s hire A&#x27;s, B&#x27;s hire C&#x27;s&quot;. Whether you believe that or not, concentrated network hiring definitely doubles down on whatever selection criteria you used to begin with. That has costs in terms of skills and experience diversity. Some of our best hires at Matasano were complete left-field candidates with radically different experiences than our existing team had.<p>* Network hiring unavoidably personalizes the hiring process: candidates come in the door with sponsors. It&#x27;s hard to hire objectively, staying as close to apple-apples as possible, when your candidates are friends of employees who have significant bonuses riding on the selection.<p>* Network hiring can make company cultures cliquish and, worse, brittle. People who&#x27;ve managed teams long-term have probably experienced the phenomenon where a team member leaves because they&#x27;re unhappy, and suddenly 1/3rd of the rest of the team &quot;wakes up&quot; and starts to churn as well. When you hire based on employee networks, your whole hiring thesis is that employees &quot;drag other employees along&quot;. What I don&#x27;t see is people acknowledging that it works both ways.<p>Add to this of course the mildly grasping sensibility behind shaking down your team members as the moral equivalent of an MLM scheme for hiring. I kid, a little --- we pay recruiting bonuses too --- but I&#x27;m &quot;kidding on the square&quot;.<p>My sense of it is that the valley believes recruiting to be a &quot;top of the funnel&quot; problem. My experience says that it isn&#x27;t. My hypothesis is that the inefficiency is in qualifying candidates (deeper in the funnel), and that if you can fix that problem, the top of the funnel can sort itself out without much effort.",1398185110

Lack of controls makes for weaker evidence, but it doesn&#x27;t magically make things unfalsifiable.<p>Yes, in fact, that&#x27;s exactly what it does. My dried gourd example should have demonstrated why this is so -- I can always claim a correlation with the gourd and the outcome, and without proper experimental controls, that&#x27;s irrefutable.<p>My dried gourd example is meant to show the need for experimental controls -- another group that recovers in the same amount of time without benefit of gourd-shaking undermines the claim that the gourd had anything to do with the outcome. But &quot;undermines&quot; doesn&#x27;t equal &quot;falsified&quot; -- the latter condition requires that we test an explanation, not just an observation.<p>The method of performing more experiments, gathering more data, decreases the p-value of the outcome, but it cannot turn a hypothesis into a theory until we&#x27;re testing an explanation rather than measuring an effect. As long as we measure effects without trying to explain them, we&#x27;re doing an expensive kind of accounting, but not science. Science requires that we try to offer and then test an explanation for what&#x27;s being observed, and toss the explanations that don&#x27;t pan out.<p>The tl;dr: science requires theories.<p>> And so I ask you again: What makes you say these studies are unfalsifiable?<p>The problem we&#x27;re having here involves a definition of terms -- what falsifiable means.

Having a CA signed cert proves nothing beyond that you gave some person who is trusted some amount of money who ostensibly verified something.<p>It&#x27;s a racket in its implementation. The PKI model used nowadays is rotten and exploitative. Renewals which exist as a pure profit vehicle for CAs (upwards of $100 to run some code and generate a hash? Fkn seriously?), the implementation in every browser which treats a self-signed certificate as coming from a known bad guy, or the slightest misconfiguration as same.<p>But every single user out there has it drilled into their head to look for the little lock (or nowadays, the much more expensive by a factor of ten or so green bar) before shopping, and every browser out there throws really scary looking errors (Chrome&#x27;s red screen of doom) for something so much as an expiration date. The CA&#x27;s can effectively say &quot;Gee, that&#x27;s a nice commerce website you have there, would be a shame if something were to happen to it and all your customers got scared off since you didn&#x27;t pay your protec^H^H^H^H renewal fee&quot; - Some basically do, especially around renewal time.<p>Charging to regenerate or revoke a certificate (again, completely automated processes with zero human interaction required) is just rent-seeking dick behavior of the highest order.<p>Why do I have to pay upwards of $100 for a wildcard certificate? They don&#x27;t cost the CA anymore to issue or handle, it&#x27;s identical to any other certificate except the CN field is written slightly differently. No, the fuckers expect me to either pay for a massively overpriced bit of hashed code or pay lots of times for slightly different overpriced bits of hashed code. Either way, i&#x27;m getting screwed.

There are different kinds of\nneurons, and signals on synapses are not simply binary.  However, even with these\ncomplications, the hardware needed to reach these scales isn&#x27;t hard to imagine.<p><pre><code>    Transistors in XBox One:                1.0e09\n</code></pre>\nBrains are biological computers so they suffer from very slow switching speeds at the neural\nlevel.  Neurons run in parallel, but they are not fast:<p><pre><code>    Approximate neural switching speed:     1.0e03/sec\n</code></pre>\nEven if all of the synapeses could sustain this rate in parallel (they can&#x27;t) and even if all of the brain was 100% occupied with solving a single task (it isn&#x27;t) this would mean that we absolutely can&#x27;t compute faster than:<p><pre><code>    Speed * synapses (brain ops per second): 1.0e17/sec\n</code></pre>\nFor comparison, the fastest bitcoin hardware I see is advertised to operate at the\nfollowing speed:<p><pre><code>    Minerscube 15 (hashes per second):      1.5e12/sec\n</code></pre>\nAnd a regular GPU is capable of simple instructions that run at the following speed:<p><pre><code>    AMD Radeon HD 6990 32-bit instructions: 2.6e12/sec\n</code></pre>\nFrom this we can see that hardware is catching up with the raw computing ability of\nthe human brain. Now consider the problem of programming a brain.  It isn&#x27;t necessary to\nprogram every synapse.  The brain learns, and essentially programs itself.  To see\nwhy this is true consider the programming that we are born with:<p><pre><code>    Bits of information in human genome:    1.0e10\n</code></pre>\nThis is far less than the number of synapses that we have. Therefore, the brain must\nprogram itself, somehow.<p>Now, to address the argument about evolution taking millions of years.  First, we can \nevolve programs much faster than nature can evolve humans.  There have been, perhaps,\n100 million generations of humans.  Even if it takes six seconds of computing time to\nrun an evolutionary computation for a single generation it will take no more than\n20 years to run over 100 million generations.<p>Brute force evolution isn&#x27;t the only way to build strong AI.  A program can exhibit\nbehavior that we don&#x27;t anticipate.  I&#x27;ve written simple programs that beat me easily\nat games such as Othello or Freecell.<p>Finally, once machines get smart enough to design other machines there may be a\nrapid acceleration of progress in this area as we employ them in designing subsequent generations.<p>I feel that strong AI may pose a significant risk to humans; consequently, we should\nproceed with caution.  Here is a thought experiment.  If a chimpanzee could be taught to drive, would you trust it to pick your kids up from school?  What sort of value judgements would it make in the case of an impending emergency?  Would you let an elephant baby sit for you?  Even if was much &quot;smarter&quot; than a normal elephant?<p>Strong AI will not be like us.  It will learn and develop without a human body, and it will not interact with the world and society as we do and may end up being very foreign to us.  Will it be sociopathic?  Or will it be like whales, intelligent, but mysterious, perhaps spending all its time singing AI songs to other AIs.",1398183351

Erh, obviously U.S. equities traded in quarters and eights (and later sixteenths before decimalization), but to say that they were using a weird fractional system <i>because</i> they wanted to rip people off isn&#x27;t documented anywhere in the literature. They could have moved to decimals and still kept the minimum price variation above a penny†, or they could have just added more fractions (32nds, 64ths, 128ths) that would have moved the minimum price variation into roughly the range you get by quoting in decimals. If you think quoting in 128ths sounds silly I won&#x27;t argue with you, but it&#x27;s something they do actually do for the US treasury futures contracts on the CME††.<p>I suspect that they just used what worked. In a market of human traders, it&#x27;s much easier to deal with large round numbers. I think that&#x27;s why odd lots were treated specially too. E.g. It&#x27;s a lot easier for humans to keep track of 5000 shares at 50 1/2 than in 100 small orders from 200 shares to 5 shares all priced between 50.40 and 50.60. As markets adopted technology, they naturally moved to a smaller minimum price variation (and eliminated the special treatment of odd lots) because computers don&#x27;t have any problems dealing with an aggregate of small orders vs one big order.<p>† They are actually talking about doing this for some small cap stocks later this year. <a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304275304579396861123381346"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230427530...</a><p>†† ctrl-f &quot;Quotation Practices&quot; -- <a href=""http://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/understanding-treasury-futures.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cmegroup.com/education/files/understanding-treasu...</a>",1398182834
7628495,comment,7627101,7628142,1,0,moron4hire,,,"Thanks, that means a lot to me.<p>I&#x27;ve toyed with the idea of using Markdown. As long as the formatting doesn&#x27;t get in the way of the writing is the key. People have a real problem with focusing on the work that matters. It&#x27;s really easy to procrastinate by doing busy-work like making sure you&#x27;re using the right type of bullets for your lists.<p>My original idea was to have formatting be a completely separate mode. But the more I think about the problem in general, I realize that at some point, it&#x27;s impossible to 100% disassociate content from presentation. Markdown is probably the best compromise. Some other people have had success with writing full, going-to-print books through Markdown. It&#x27;s certainly a better choice than a full WYSIWYG or GUI editor.<p>Formatting is also one of those features that people think they need when they don&#x27;t. Currently, you write into individual chapters, and the chapters get concatenated correctly to have page breaks and headers. There are many different types of books that need no more formatting than that, novels in particular. I&#x27;d rather spend time working on getting full ePub docs implemented (I can write HTML files to ZIP files right now, but haven&#x27;t done much beyond that, more just need to read the spec and get it done at this point), or getting some of the flow-encouraging mini-games made. Or finally building a real server (this is all 100% client-side right now) so I can let people publish their writing directly to their own blog.<p>I also need to spend some time in the marketing department. There is a lot to do.

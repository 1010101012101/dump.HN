I mean, it would have been five minutes work to add a filter to remove Karma Sutra from the list of books, yet instead he preferred to enter a back-and-forth with Apple, a no-win situation, instead of making the quick mod and getting his app out there.<p>Of course, I know that we hackers do like to take a stand for our priciples, so maybe he has a more altruistic motivation, but considering that he takes pains to add the possibility to register to be notified when the app comes out on his website (something which would take way longer to code than to filter the book in the first place), I have my doubts.",1242982606

2. Remembering that Million -> billion -> trillion
3. Knowing that 1000 million = 1 billion
4. Knowing that 1000 billion = 1 trillion
5. Knowing that 1000 * 1000 = 1 million",1242982234

621760,comment,621731,621746,0,0,jmathes,,,"In the long scale, it's like this:
10^3 = thousand
10^6 = million
10^9 = milliard
10^12 = billion
10^15 = billiard
10^18 = trillion<p>So there are 10^18/10^6 = 10^12 millions in a trillion.  In the long scale, they'd call that a billion.  So the two correct answers are ""there are a million millions in a trillion"" and ""there are a billion millions in a trillion""",1242981834

621748,comment,620482,621667,0,0,ZeroGravitas,,,"I really don't think it's that simple. Things I believe but can't prove:<p>* Open Source Usability, just like OS security, engineering, marketing, QA, translation, installation, update schedule, funding model etc. etc. will be different from the closed source analog. Doesn't make either ""better"" <i>a priori</i>, but does mean you can't transplant one to the other wholesale and have it work the same, nor can you easily compare one against the benchmark of the other.<p>* That Open Source Usability <i>will</i> in fact follow your two steps with a crucial difference. It will still involve super awesome frameworks that do everything but will be followed by figuring out how to expose <i>different subsets</i> of those features in multiple UIs. Potential case study the UI horror that is Evolution (because it tried to copy proprietary Outlook) spawning multiple new frontends like the pimlico suite that expose just contacts or calendar and the new Anjal mail client:<p><a href=""http://blogs.gnome.org/sragavan/2009/03/18/announcing-anjal-the-new-mail-for-netbooks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.gnome.org/sragavan/2009/03/18/announcing-anjal-...</a><p>* Corollary of the above: if you're copying a proprietary UI wholesale then you're probably doing it wrong. Steal the ideas yes but re-interpret them in a way that makes sense for open source platforms.<p>* iTunes is a usability disaster since commercial and proprietary pressures have forced a CD player, CD ripper, music library, internet radio, online music store, party music player, network jukebox, video player, iPod manager and god knows what else into a single app. This is actually the anithesis of Apple design principles but is forced on them by the need to push their stuff onto Windows. If you're working on a music player for the Linux desktop, for the love of god, stop copying iTunes.<p>* Safari/Webkit is what it is because it a) started with code from KHTML and Mozilla, b) continues to be an open source project that is used as a component in multiple applications, including two completey different browser UIs from Apple alone (Safari and Mobile Safari, the latter being a far more impressive UI. Safari itself is mostly just minimalist, and that's why I use it, with a few odd gee-whizz features thrown in.).<p>* There's plenty of good software on Mac OS X that adds well thought out Cocoa UI onto a bunch of existing open source frameworks and libraries. Writing stuff from scratch is stupid when the libraries are there for the taking.<p>* OSS and Usability focus are not in conflict. When Panic were so anal about their UI for Mac OS X app Coda that they decided to include a programming font they based it on an open source one. This is not a zero-sum game. Mac OS X is shot through with open source from top to bottom, 1st to 3rd party.<p>* proprietary pressures can corrupt user interfaces. (See iTunes example above) Why doesn't Internet Explorer have spell-checking? Because it threatens Word. Why doesn't Microsoft Office warn you that it's going to remove all the formulas from your ODF spreadsheet? Because it threatens their standards hegemony. Some proprietary software constantly gets in your way because it is trying to impose its will on you. User hostile software is not known for good UI.<p>* Usability without function is worse than function without usability. Recent example: Ego iPhone app breaking because of a Google API change

It makes far more sense. That's why I was confused to not see the 'correct' answer listed :)<p>For example in the Short scale, their logic is: billion=
1,000 ^ (1 + 2). So for example TRIllion, the tri is pretty unintuitive. It has 3+(3 * TRI) zeros.<p>In the Long scale, the logic is trillion=1,000,000^TRI or 6 * TRI zeros.<p>I had no idea the UK had 'officially' abandoned the Long scale in 1970s, while the rest of Europe still officially uses it. I'm sure I was taught Long scale. Shame.",1242980695

What I found pretty awe inspiring, and awash with potential, was the project Flikr are engaged in. They compute 3d models of popular landmarks and sight-seeing destinations using the varied photos from all angles that are uploaded to their servers.
I always figured that this, along with something akin to what this Swedish company (or if anyone saw the Chinese one that was on HN a while back, complete with billboards!?) would be the next generation development platform for games and who knows what!",1242980648

3655013,comment,3651063,3652217,1,0,padwiki,,,"Ok, I'll assume you are Ben or Tom for the purpose of this discussion.<p>If I were in the position to really move the Khan system forward, I would focus on a few key areas. First, the teacher tools at Khan are fantastic for showing the flow of students through the material and tying in to standards based grading. But, and this is a big but, the tools for independent students are almost non-existent.<p>Our system is also self paced and one of the largest problems we had to solve was how to keep a self-paced system from being ""I'll get to it one of these days"". The Khan system, when it is outside of classroom pacing, definitely suffers from that problem. Our approach is to have the student set section or exercise deadlines for themselves, then evaluate them based on how accurately they meet those goals. It allows for flexibility in pacing but still taps into the motivation of a looming deadline. You can do this at the micro level (I will complete this exercise in 7 minutes), badge level, or group larger sections together for larger targets. Risk of just setting far future deadlines is mitigated by including data from other students to introduce competition. In addition to helping to motivate the student from a pacing perspective, it helps teach accurate estimation and integrity.<p>Second, and the only reason I am sharing this is because when we launch in a few days everyone will see it, is the concept of contextual notes. In our system, taking a note is not just creating a list. We tie that note to exactly what the instructor is saying and what was on the ""board"" when they were saying it, making the note system a way of building a reference library for each student. While you don't have to take the exact same approach we did, (as long as youtube is the delivery mechanism you wouldn't be able to anyway) you do have valuable data that you are not using to its full advantage - time coded transcripts.<p>Finally, if this is indeed Ben or Tom, please either fix the knowledge map or ditch it entirely. It's not helping your image to have half working features floating around.<p>Anyway, back to work.<p>-B",1330653278

Then project managers see the software being released by the better developers and keep hearing the word-of-mouth in favor of the language and decide to have their software teams use that language.

It is not so simple that Java is a bad language and Scala is a good language- they have different features <i>and</i> different design goals.<p>Java was intended to be a small language, (in comparison with languages that came earlier, like C++) with unsurprising semantics and syntax. Java does not have operator overloading, unsigned types or multiple inheritance (in the C++ sense), and these omissions were intentional- to make code easier to understand in isolation and easier to reason about. If you want a language which can express as much as possible in a line of code, Java fails miserably. On the other hand, programmers around the world have built and maintained enormous codebases in Java, suggesting that the ""maintenance-oriented"" features of the language may have been successful.<p>edit: Paraphrasing, James Gosling has said that the success of Java was to drag a large number of C++ programmers ""halfway to Lisp"" by cleaning up undefined behavior and introducing them to garbage collection.",1330651355

3654943,comment,3653540,3653540,2,0,mrxd,,,"I was once on Zeldman's semantic CSS bandwagon - Designing with Web Standards was the Bible for me. Not anymore. Now I think it is a huge mistake that creates unmaintainable CSS. Here's why:<p>Let's say I want to style a box to hold an image and a caption that goes in a blog post. Semantic CSS would have me do something like this:<p><pre><code>    div.post div.picture {
        border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #eee; padding: 8px; font: 11px/15px georgia, sans-serif;
    }
</code></pre>
This is OK, except this style is almost the same as a newsletter subscribe box in the sidebar, and I'm duplicating all those style here. DRY - no problem, I'll just stack the selectors:<p><pre><code>    div.post div.picture, div.moreinfo div.newsletter-subscribe {
        border: 1px solid #ccc; background: #eee; padding: 8px;
    }

    div.post div.picture {
        font: 11px/15px georgia, sans-serif;
    }
</code></pre>
But wait, that border style is being used in the nav too, so...<p><pre><code>    div.post div.picture, div.moreinfo div.newsletter-subscribe, div.nav {
        border: 1px solid #ccc;
    }

    div.post div.picture, div.moreinfo div.newsletter-subscribe {
        background: #eee; padding: 8px;
    }

    div.post div.picture {
        font: 11px/15px georgia, sans-serif;
    }
</code></pre>
We can continue with this, but you see where it is going: a huge stack of selectors followed by a declaration of one or two properties. This is obviously bad: the style for any given element is spread out in lots of different parts of the stylesheet file, or even multiple files. If I want to add a new element, I have to copy my selector into all those different points, every single time. Even if my new element has the exact same style and the only difference is that it has a different semantic meaning. Obviously, this is too much of a pain, so Semantic CSS encourages defining independent components with lots of redundancy.<p>If you're using a CSS preprocessor (which were not around when Designing with Web Standards was published), mixins partly mitigate this problem. All my rules can inherit shared styles. But there is still a problem: every time I want to use a style, I have to edit a CSS file. With Bootstrap, the process for using a zebra table is copy and paste the boilerplate HTML from the component library - done. The Semantic CSS way is to come up with a new semantic class name ("".users-table"" or whatever), find out where in the CSS the zebra table is defined, add the selector and now I can start using it. So now the whole dev team is constantly checking in changes to a shared CSS library for no purpose other than to register the fact that they are using the component, and the CSS files get bloated with hundreds of meaningless selectors.<p>This blog post cleverly proposes a separate CSS file to map semantic CSS names to style definitions - "".users-table { .table-zebra }"" - adding an extra level of unnecessary indirection. Or worse, a line of javascript. Why? On the off-chance that you might want to switch to another CSS framework that just so happens to use Bootstrap's markup, but not its class names?<p>The only thing Semantic CSS gets right is that classes shouldn't be descriptions of the properties. But there is nothing wrong with .span6 instead of .feature, or .btn-primary instead of .editUserFormSaveBtn.<p>tl;dr - Semantic CSS is a red herring that creates more problems than it solves. These problems weren't noticed because it was invented and promoted by people working on very small marketing websites without much code reuse, and is totally inappropriate for web applications of any size.",1330651242

Not to pick on this specific one, but if you're creating a UI for code editing that's not text, please design your interaction well. And yes, I know that this is probably version 0.1 and you plan to smoothen the rough edges, which is why i'll not pick on the fact that the editor for each structural element is not even in-place, for example. </end snarkiness><p>but that's not my point. writing code as text conflates two things (or 4, depending on how you think of duals):<p>1. source text has both syntax and meaning.<p>2. source text is both the display and storage format (this is the killer feature/bug).<p>my point is that every attempt to ""solve"" the ""problem of coding using text"" (on in this case the subset of lisp's umpteen parens getting in the way of understanding) focuses on the first half of #1 above.<p>as others have mentioned, there have been structural editors since the 80s. from the research i did (admittedly with limited acm access) they seemed to have died down due to two problems:<p>1. the scale problem: text packs the largest amount of information into the smallest amount of space. any visual/structural system better have a good way of dealing with large codebases.<p>2. the fluid use problem: it looks good, but is it easy to use when editing anything but a small enough piece of code this way? typically the amount of interaction ""work"" you have to do to jump between elements and so forth makes it very inefficient compared to text. the commonly cited example was ""How do you change a for loop to a while?"". in any text editor, you can take the characters apart easily to reform them into some other construct, but in a structural editor, you have to actually delete all or most of the old structure and re-form the new one. i did find research that refuted this specific claim (ask if interested), but that didn't help the adoption.<p>i have been thinking of ""better ways to code"" and structural editors in particular for about 3 years now and here're some of my conclusions to date:<p>1. text is king because of its universality - think cypher from the matrix saying ""I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head""<p>2. We already have good structural editors. They're called vim and emacs. vim has the better interaction model, imo, while emacs has better support for creating new language modes (again, imho, no flame war intended). then there's the smalltalk ides that inspired the Visual Age products that inspired eclipse.<p>3. The additional overload of ""chrome"" in text the {}'s, ()'s and begin/ends are much less a hassle than that caused by a visual editor's chrome.<p>4. There is much more value in pursuing better ways of coding than just flogging the ""text sucks"" meme. Think Non-textual language workbenches, for example.<p>Finally, one specific commment about playing around with lisp's syntax. I've tried it (<a href=""https://github.com/vinodkd/lispdown"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/vinodkd/lispdown</a>) and the one thing that stands out is: Lisp has no syntax, so it can <i>become</i> any syntax.

We don't have much indication that the attacker couldn't have taken a snapshot of a running system (or that that will be how it happens next time).<p>So, sure, use a loopback crypto filesystem. It just doesn't provide much in the way of a security guarantee (but it adds some measurable costs).",1330650115

Make the game you want, we'll support you with a paycheck, art, music, marketing, all the stuff around the game. In exchange, you get something like royalties for big games.<p>Honestly i'm surprised you don't recognize this model from movies and music and books and every other kind of media ever. It's possible to have endless debates about compromising artistic vision, but the fundamental idea is the same. We'll support you so you can create the art you love, in exchange we're keeping some of the profits.",1330650014

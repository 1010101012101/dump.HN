If you don't love research, don't bother -- it is not worth the time, money (in terms of opportunity cost vs. making a real salary in industry), or stress. Doing a PhD is stressful, if you are doing it right -- you are in constant competition with other academics to publish your results in the top venues, to make a name for yourself, to get recognized. If you harbor ideas of lazy days sitting in the coffee shop pondering the universe, you are dead wrong. (You can always approach a PhD this way, but you will probably not be very successful.)""",1284969456

1708147,comment,1707233,1707233,0,0,rossmcf,,,"I'm just finishing my PhD thesis in CS now. Like you, I don't want to work in academia. Was it worth it? It's a tough call.<p>I greatly appreciate the time and relative freedom that my PhD has given me to develop, but not all of that development will be applicable out there in the real world. I think most people moving from PhD study into industry have to make something of a sideways leap, and you can't expect the same level of remuneration as you'd find in a job you're qualified for (i.e. research).<p>In my recent job-hunting, I've had a really hard time convincing potential employers to trade my overeducation against my inexperience. Recruiters, who often just match acronyms on a CV/resume, are particularly tough in this regard. One told me that, despite me having a PhD, he would only put me forward for roles that said 'new graduate' or 'no experience required'.<p>You can combat this, however. In my experience, there's time when doing a PhD to do some extra-curricular stuff—to work or to develop personal projects. These will help you to look less like the kind of narrow-minded, misanthropic pedant that people expect from a PhD student.<p>In summary, the only thing a PhD will qualify you for is research. Having a PhD, as prestigious as it is, is only as useful as you make it, so your choice of topic and extra-curricular activites are essential. If you're considering a PhD because the jobs your ideal job isn't open to you, consider whether taking the sideways step into PhD study is really the most direct route to the job you want (read: it probably isn't).<p>One more thing: be aware that your relationship with your advisor is crucial. Quitting because you can't stand them two years into your PhD means starting over, so choose wisely. Don't choose them based on the person you want to be, choose based on how they fit with who you are now.<p>All the best.",1284968797

What JSR 292 does is to simplify the work a compiler architect needs to do, since implementing call-site caches is hard work, not to mention memory management since interpreters like JRuby are generating lots of classes that are entering PermGen ... so stuff like java.dyn.AnonymousClassLoader may provide some relief.<p>But on the other hand, compilers will still need to support Java pre-7, since adoption in the enterprise is really slow (many companies are still on version 1.4)<p>There is a backport for invokedynamic though, but it remains to be seen if it's any good: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jvm-language-runtime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jvm-language-runtime/</a><p>Notably missing features with a lot more bang than InvokeDynamic:<p><pre><code>      tail-call optimization

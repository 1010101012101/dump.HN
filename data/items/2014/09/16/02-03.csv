Excel also supports fraction number formats.  The format &quot;?/?&quot; writes the closest fraction whose denominator is less than 10.<p>The algorithm used to calculate the fraction seems to agree with the Oliver Aberth paper &quot;A method for exact computation with rational numbers&quot;.  Based on this algorithm, 0.3 is represented as &quot;2/7&quot; and any number slightly larger than 0.3 is represented as &quot;1/3&quot;.<p>Try setting A1 to 0.3, A2 to =0.1+0.2 and change the cell format to Fraction .. Up to one digit.  Both cells appear to be 0.3 when rendered under the General format.  However, when using the fraction, the cells differ.<p>Google Docs renders both numbers as 2/7, but the XLSX export correctly preserves the IEEE754 numbers.

And until I do that, there is warning highlighting on the function.<p>Now in some ways this may seem silly - are you really going to understand code without understanding types? But especially for people new to the language, _or_ when you&#x27;re dealing with new libraries (if you&#x27;ve ever written a little wrapper around a function from a complicated library, you know what I mean), it&#x27;s nice to choose whether you want to work from values or from types (where undefined is your friend).<p>Which isn&#x27;t to say that think rust&#x27;s decision is bad, just that having flexibility makes this kind of tooling easier (and I&#x27;m assuming here that in all cases, the end result will be all annotated top level functions).

I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll bounce back, though I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s very wise to be so public about this so quickly, when emotions are raw and high.<p>500px is definitely one of the better known startups here in Toronto. They have a great product, they just need to settle on a product direction and execute. The comments about employee churn aren&#x27;t surprising to me. And the unfortunate part about startups is that failure is typically the result of internal turmoil, so here&#x27;s hoping they iron it all out quickly.",1410833177

Notch sorta does (cf. &quot;I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.&quot;).<p>(For the record, I think most of his opinions are great opinions.)<p>I&#x27;m open to the idea that people can change their minds, or that the circumstances might be different, or that he felt he couldn&#x27;t do the job anymore, or didn&#x27;t fit in, or whatever else. But the fact remains that this sale runs in direct opposition to basically everything he&#x27;s ever said in public. Now, maybe he doesn&#x27;t want to live a life where what he says &quot;in public&quot; has some kind of significance apart from what he just says in general. That seems to be the case - it&#x27;s his prerogative and if he thinks that&#x27;s what best for him I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s right. But people are still going to call him a hypocrite, and that&#x27;s the price he&#x27;s going to have to pay.<p>And that&#x27;s the part that makes me a little sad. I like Minecraft, but not so much that I&#x27;m going to be heartbroken when Microsoft inevitably ruins it. But I did find myself in agreement with Notch on a lot of things, and I was glad that he was able to do what he did and be outspoken about things he thought were important, etc etc. And with this sale, we also lose that. Oh well.",1410832838

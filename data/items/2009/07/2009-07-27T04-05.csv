And all of the sites are completely FREE for real estate agents.  It's difficult to compete with a company that has a nice, easy-to-use system that is FREE.  And they're just starting to market nationally.  We eventually just started using them instead of developing our own...and we're a company with 50+ full-time developers on staff.

Can we assume that there are tiers, and even that the earlier tiers might get an X% return before the late tier gets their full investment back?",1248670250

I should similarly have an address ""number"" (which is mapped to a physical location by the post office). That way, when I move, I don't need to contact every magazine I subscribe to, every friend I have, every bill I pay, EVERYONE.

So yes, it's less than ideal when you can be already be reasonably certain that credentials mean <i>something</i> (i.e. someone with a degree in chemical engineering is at least halfway capable of maintaining a part of a chemical plant), or you can look at things like what sort of papers they've published, what OSS projects they've contributed to, etc.<p>As for the hiring relatives regardless of their skill...  this matters when skill <i>really</i> matters.  When you're in a winner-takes-all field like finance or tech, it can be very much less than ideal and we myopically don't recognize that the rest of the world gets on without being exceptional at problem solving.<p>The flip side to the hiring relatives bit is that native-born Chinese are generally able to extract higher loyalty and work ethic from their relatives because of these same bonds.  There is the feeling that you are all together.<p>So for all the talk of China steamrolling the world, I just don't believe it.  You have to look at what benefits and costs this sort of culture provides.  You get high societal stability, and a caring family that will support you, but one that can in some ways hold you back as well.  Their societal structure may have worked extraordinarily well with manufacturing, but tech?

it depends on what you and me define ""quality"" as :-). I base my claims of the following chronological series of events:
1. Sam Pitroda heads the Knowledge Commission and advises the govt to increase the number of institutions and universities in the country to increase the % of people pursuing higher education.
2. There is a mad rush and suddenly a lot of deemed universities. In Tamil Nadu, its big business.
3. step #2 implies lot more engineers. The eligibility and criteria for engineering relaxes gradually. It stood at 60 when I passed out of school(2002). Now its 45!
4. Supply exceeds demand(by a huge margin).
5. one fine day, govt wakes up. Yashpal committee submits report to govt on ensuring the quality of deemed universities.(happened last month)
6. govt yet to take action based on the report.",1248670059

725376,comment,725191,725367,0,0,nico,,,"Thanks for the info. I think ""purchasing cards"" should be for everybody, not only for large companies. And the concept could be applied for checks, money wires, debit cards, paypal, etc.<p>Here in my country, banks make a large profit out of fraud, albeit indirectly. They offer fraud insurance. They purchase the insurance from someone else for about USD 1/month, and sell it to you for USD 6/month. Of course most people never get to claim anything. Each time there's anything related to credit card fraud on the news, banks get more people buying their insurance (here banks are the only credit card-issuing institutions). If banks offered a cheaper/free way to reduce or eliminate fraud, they would also kill their insurance business.<p>About the multiple strips cards:
In Japan they're already using NFC cards with internal chips that can store several different cards information. The info is encrypted so that only certain authorized card readers may read corresponding card info.

I say somewhat simply because lucid dreaming is not the main goal.<p>One of the tricks that I like is, don't laugh, to pull a finger. In a dream, this one will stretch without any difficulty. I has never failed me but once. Once I gain lucidity, I usually jump in order to fly. And yes, it is an amazing experience. By the way, from my experience, consciousness in a dream is not binary (ie., you have it or you don't). I have observed that the degree of consciousness varies depending on several factors. Some depend on your health, mentally and physically. But other factors seem to be more important, at least for me, but these are of spiritual nature which I won't discuss here.<p>I believe that one of the main problems on why is so difficult to become conscious in a dream is the possibility that the mind is another entity than yourself or something like that. I remember reading something along those lines when searching for meditation. I believe that Buddhism teaches something like that but I really don't remember. I was able to experience this disconnect once in a dream. I distinctively remember looking at an event which I knew was not possible, but at the same time I had a thought that said that it was possible.<p>Having experienced this, I know try to learn more about it. No long ago there was an post here on HN about research regarding how cutting between scenes, in a movie for example, affects memory- I think. Sadly I don't have the link. I find this very intriguing since many of my dreams are like movies where viewpoints and scenes change without me questioning it. I must admit that I have watched a lot of TV in my life and I am constantly trying to limit the amount or stop it completely. I would throw the TV out if it was up to me but it's not.<p>Hopefully someday I will become an oneironaut ;)",1248667467

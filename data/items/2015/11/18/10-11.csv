The tapes they&#x27;re talking about were just NASA&#x27;s recordings of that direct broadcast. So there never was any opportunity for the tapes to be edited like that, because they didn&#x27;t sit in the chain between the cameras on the moon and the broadcasts everyone saw on their TVs. Fortunately other news organisations (and probably governments) also taped the broadcast as well, hence we still have recordings available.<p>In fact, it was technologically impossible to record the entire live broadcast on a single tape because tapes with enough capacity didn&#x27;t exist until many years later. Therefore a faked broadcast from tapes would have had visible transitions as they switched from tape to tape. These transitions would have been visible on the taped copies of the broadcast which the currently available recordings derive from.",1447843388

One that thinks we should never critique any idea he has because he did something one time. That&#x27;s not logically justifiable but let&#x27;s try that.<p>Reality check: Snowden is both a whistleblower and a traitor. Heroically leaked evidence of abuse in domestic collection. However, he also leaked all our specific capabilities we <i>legally and with America&#x27;s support</i> used on foreign countries ranging from competitors to opponents. Even Snowden admitted the good those tools do... did... again opponents like China. No good reason to ne to blow all our capabilities and many assets while leaving cooperating and competing nations to do same stuff against us PLUS have moral high ground.<p>Did he do this for a great reason with a gain worth that loss? No, he said why he didnt take time to differentiate the files: he didn&#x27;t want to be caught with them, interrogated, bear journalistic burden, etc. So he just dumped our <i>unredacted, foreign ops</i> onto <i>foreign journalists</i> to dodge that risk and burden. Went from hero to total coward when I learned this. No self-sacrificing patriot of U.S. would blow all legitimate, foreign activity to save his own ass. That&#x27;s what he said, though.<p>So, far from infallible God, your beloved Snowden has a complex, moral situation. He seems like a principle-driven person who took enormous risk to get information the public needed to know. He then published that plus stuff he shouldn&#x27;t... which public largely condemns him over... just to reduce chance of harm to him. Quite selfish and treasonous. So, I have mixed feelings about him while being greatful for good stuff he did. And so... &quot;but Snowden said!&quot;... does not a good argument make unless it&#x27;s specific, NSA stuff.

For example, when you manipulate strings in template, you can be reasonably sure all output is escaped, unless you specify otherwise in a very few precise cases with explicit syntax.<p>A good template language allows you to create/limit available tools/helpers for your particular project. That is especially important in larger projects and larger teams, where everyone is not immediately expected to know intended good practice to follow. Creating DSL in template _is_ a way of documenting intended good practice.<p>A good template language does not pretend not to be turing-complete: instead, it provides comprehensive error handling and error messages, so that users know exactly where some error or type occurred.<p>One more reason to use the language is because it is a language. If someone used something like Django, the Twig will be quite familiar and easy to pick up.<p>Template engine can optimize-away, pre-compile things, just like languages do.<p>With separate template language you don&#x27;t need to recompile whole build if you change a template (presuming hosting language is compiling to binary and template engine is interpreted).<p>Full disclosure: I am currently rewriting Twig in another language, and believe it&#x27;s completely worth the effort.",1447842939

You mention that evil cannot be defined in precise terms, and that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;m talking about. It&#x27;s not a property of things in reality that can be measured, it&#x27;s a judgement about things made by people. The judgment may be very rational, but it can&#x27;t be based wholly on objective reality. For that to be the case, it&#x27;d have to be based on a physical law or property rather than a moral principle, and I just don&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s possible. Your argument for why Hitler was evil is really solid, not because it&#x27;s based in objective reality but because it&#x27;s based the principle that the continued existence of the human race is a good thing. I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a solid enough principle that it may as well be objective reality. But technically speaking, it&#x27;s still a subjective judgement that we&#x27;re making about how things should be, rather than an objective observation of how they are.<p>This is a really pedantic, subtle and (I think) important distinction. If one sees good and evil as objective truth, they&#x27;re reliant on the source of that truth for their moral judgement. This explains the jihadists you mention. It&#x27;s not that they enjoy being murdering maniacs (although I&#x27;m sure some do), it&#x27;s that their source of moral truth tells them that the infidels are evil and must be destroyed (or whatever), so they see what they&#x27;re doing as a good thing.",1447842621

However, <i>if not</i>, the FBI entrapped Mohamud. (why? read on)<p>The article goes into detail about Mohamud&#x27;s upbringing. I&#x27;m going to take a few quotes from it:\n<i>- &#x27;Like many refugee children, Mohamud had to deal with cultural barriers that separated him from his parents, his American friends, and his mostly white classmates. There is little question he felt different. For an issue of the class magazine, for example, Duncan asked his students to draw cartoons of themselves and caption them. Under his portrait, Mohamud wrote, “I’m the black one.”&#x27;<p>- &#x27;Mohamud’s friends from that time acknowledged he was easy to influence&#x27;<p>- “Home was kind of a hostile environment for him,”</i> [re: his parents breakup who subsequently divorced]<p><i>- &#x27;“manipulable” and “conflicted”&#x27;</i> [the words in double quotes are those as written in an email by FBI Special Agent DeLong to other FBI agents in 2009]<p><i>- &#x27;“shy around authority figures.”&#x27;</i><p>When you take someone like that and make them the target of a sting operation...<p>I&#x27;m just not going to finish my sentence.<p>Not only that, here is another (lengthy) quote:<p><i>The public record of that meeting is incomplete. In what the FBI claimed was an honest mistake, Youssef’s tape recorder had dead batteries. Apart from the anonymous agent’s testimony, the only source for what Mohamud said that day is a summarized report prepared by Chan. At trial, Chan said he had destroyed his original notes.<p>(The defense took great issue with this at trial. Entrapment law requires prosecutors to show that a defendant was predisposed to commit the crime before the first contact with government agents. The nuances of Mohamud’s behavior and language during the first meeting, the defense argued, were vital.)</i><p>The FBI do not have a checklist that involves checking the batteries of any electronic devices to be used in an operation prior to operation.<p>Edit: spacing",1447842163

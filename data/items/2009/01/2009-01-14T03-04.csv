Its fairly uncommon to hear them sue someone for patent infringement, and they probably have a patent on just about anything (MS has a patent on the strlen algorithm for example, its really insane).<p>In other words, worry about getting sued by a patent troll not a big company. Also, perversely, I think you better off not even looking for patents in the first place because one of the factors that can go against you in a patent lawsuit is whether or not you were aware of the patent in the first place.",1231905502

I appreciate the effort, really, but you just didn’t go about patching this or releasing the patch in the right way at all.<p>First, you made a forum post about it - which is the correct thing to do. Let other people validate that what you are experiencing is actually a bug. If you look through the replies you would see that Derek Allard (programmer) and Rick Ellis (CEO/Founder) responded. You never submitted a ticket in the bug tracker, which would have allowed the EllisLabs team (and you) to easily diagnose and update the community on the status of this bug.<p>Just a reply or two underneath Rick’s post someone mentions that it has been fixed in SVN.<p>Now, you come out with an entire release of CodeIgniter, just to release a simple patch that has already been fixed in the repository. Not only that, but you post that fix to Hacker News and the forums announcing what you have done.<p>Essentially, what you did here, was fork CodeIgniter to gain incoming traffic to your blog and ultimately your product. You didn’t wait on EllisLab’s to fix the issue (as it is reportedly already fixed) nor did you give them the opportunity or the tools/information to do so (outside of the forum).<p>Usually, a forum post is all that is required to get a bug fixed - but if it’s something important that you really want a status update on, the community policies are very clear - submit a ticket.<p>Hooray for throwing an awesome piece of open source software under the bus for your own profit.",1231904291

433104,comment,432862,432862,0,0,cdibona,,,"Two thoughts:<p>1) Never, ever, ever do patent investigations before coding. If you for some reason still build something and are sued, it's called willful infringement and awards triple.<p>2) Successful patent litigation or settlements on non-executed (or submarined) patents are rarely if ever successful. It does happen, but it is very rare.<p>3) Patent litigation happens, but rarely is it tried against small fry (read small fry as meaning unprofitable, less than say 20m in the bank, non-public and smallish, less than 100 employees,etc..) It just almost never happens. If your company is the one you link to, stop worrying about it. You are too small to bother with. Anyone threatening you will likely buy you or be themselves out of business before you can get anywhere near where you could make a court appearance.<p>4) People will threaten. So what. It can take many (4 ->7) years for a patent case to get to trial, your lawyers on retainer can do all the wrong things and it will still take years and years. You can settle any moment before a ruling, so why do it immediately?<p>Anyhow, I'm not a lawyer, but I've been in this space for a very very long time. Good luck.",1231903439

1. My 14"" Dell 600m is falling apart, literally. Pieces of the case are falling off. I get electrocuted by the battery regularly. The screen hinges are on their last leg.<p>2. I need a reliable back-up machine because my desktop has some serious irreconcilable gremlims. This is particularly true because I tend to rage if I lose code when a machine goes down.<p>3. I just lost ~$1500 of stuff including my desktop computer monitor (amongst other things) and had to borrow a couple CRTs from some friends to get my desktop back up and running. I'd like to invest in a machine I tote with me.<p>Necessities:
1. DVD Burner. Non-negotiable.
2. Not 17"", not a netbook.<p>Niceties:
1. Mac OS X. Huge bonus. This means hardware that can run mac OS X natively that isn't a netbook, or an actual macbook if there are no options. (I haven't found such a non-apple laptop that is not a netbook and can run leopard natively, do you guys know of one that isn't an MSI Wind or Dell Mini 9?)<p>I want the unix without the hassle. I likes my bash, but the situation with Linux and the lack of robustness for the power user/home user is getting absurd. I've been using Linux for a decade, and I'm tired of hoping it'll sort itself out.<p>2. Something under $1.5k, preferably under $1k. I'll take suggestions above that mark if they're sufficiently z0mg-great, but I just had a lot of stuff stolen and don't need to dump a car worth's of cash on a laptop.<p>3. Within the 13-14"" range. 12s are too small for long-term use, 15s too big for what I use a laptop for. 13 and 14 is usually perfect. I can deal with 15 for the right laptop.<p>4. A graphics chip that can run a few games (Eve Online in my case) is a plus. This is particularly notable because again, if deskie goes down, it'd be nice if this could take up <i>all</i> functions inherent to my desktop. Not a necessity for the right laptop.<p>5. Illuminated keyboard. Wicked yo.<p>CANDIDATES SO FAR:<p>New Last-gen Macbook: $999 <=== this is shaping up to be a poor deal. No DVD-burner, integrated graphics, and high'ish price. However, this can be rectified with a refurb model I found from apple. $949 for 2.4GHz White model with DVD Burner and 2 GB of ram.<p>XPS M1330: This occurred to me because of CodingHorror, but fer godssakes, in order to get the dedicated graphics I hit the macbook price point, which at that point, I'm buying a macbook.<p>Dell Studios and Inspirons are out of the question. Price efficient to an extent, but too big and the reasonable-sized Inspiron (13"") isn't easy to turn into an all-rounder without making it get within sniffing distance of the $949 Macbook.<p>Lenovo Thinkpads (T400/X300?):
Wonderful machines, and I love the hardware compatibility with Linux/BSD. However, the price enters the stratosphere quickly (buying a macbook at that point, again), and the build quality isn't as good as it used to be. I have nothing but love for the trackpoint though. A trackpoint is the only interface related improvement I could make upon a macbook pro personally.<p>Sony VAIO Laptops: Great build quality, I like the chiclet keyboards (not just because apple uses them, I'm just fast with them). Nice machines, and the price isn't as bad as it used to be, but it's impossible to get one with something better than integrated graphics without bumping into macbook territory. The accessories are hell on earth expensive too, like Lenovo.<p>What do you guys use? How do you use it? How many of you are using Macs? Seems like a lot these days.<p>Software I use:<p>I do do some .NET programming, but I'd like to migrate to using more python/ruby. I don't mind dual-booting a mac in case I need to.<p>EDIT: Another plus to the Macs is I'd love to give iphone dev a try!<p>Suggestions?",1231903242

433097,comment,432214,433083,0,0,unalone,,,"There's a quote from Steven Bond, some guy whose web site I read a while ago, regarding why he critiques awful movies:<p>""Why do I review crap? Simple: for pleasure. For the sheer joy of it. Every piece of crap you like is an immense world of delight waiting to be explored. Crap is a driving force, crap is inspirational: nothing urges me to set things right more than seeing them done wrong. I'm especially pleased when the crap is so bad it makes me angry — for anger is a pleasant sensation. To feel your bile rise and your blood boil, to feel a rush of fury — why, it's the pleasure of being alive, of feeling some actual emotion instead of the constant dull fuzz of the easily contented.""<p><a href=""http://plover.net/~bonds/stupidresponses.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://plover.net/~bonds/stupidresponses.html</a><p>Partly it's that. Anger towards the system very often gives you the energy, motivation, and experience enough to make something great.

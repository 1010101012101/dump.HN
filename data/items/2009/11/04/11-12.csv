Do you even have nukes, for that matter, that ancient 60 year old tech?<p>You don't need any of this, In guerrilla warfare mechanized infantry (tanks) are really only good for expensive body armor and neither side could use nukes if they had them (you would just be bombing yourself). Utilizing either would cause to many civilian casualties and the nasty part of guerrilla warfare is that for each 1 killed their are 50 recruits that have seen family and friends die (hardcore). Once this happens you have one of three choices surrender, withdraw or genocide.",1257335456

Although git makes it easier to merge with mainline, in the end it still requires an active maintainer who manually merges and tests stuff once in a while. Maintaining a fork requires one's constant attention and diverts one from doing other - maybe more useful - things.",1257335024

The two required texts for it were ""Getting to Yes"" and ""The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator"".  My recollection is that these are the only two books on the topic (or were at the time) that are based on research.  ""Getting to Yes"" is short and an easy read.  ""The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator"" is a much meatier book.  I recommend it often.",1257334793

921499,comment,920704,920990,0,0,kls,,,"This is not true, Guerrilla style warfare is one of the few styles of warfare where technical superiority does not equal a total advantage on the battlefield. The reasons being is that you general negate mechanized infantry and air superiority. Even the advantages of selective fire assault rifles are somewhat muted. The number one advantage in these situations is familiarity with the terrain. It was the deciding factor in the revolutionary war, Vietnam, Soviet / Afghanistan, and if something does not change US / Afghanistan. Time and time again some of the poorest nations beat the most powerful nation of that time by simply drawing them into a Guerrilla war.",1257334249

Feel free to down-mod me if you believe this is of no value, but if you think I'm wrong, I would appreciate hearing your point of view.<p>Open rant:<p>The singular is ""optimum"" - ""optima"" is plural.<p>I know this sounds like I'm just being a grammar nazi, but perceptions matter.  If someone comes to your web site and their first impression is noise, disorganisation, garish colors, etc., then they will go away, and quickly, and find your competitors, even if they aren't as good.<p>When you work with people, some of them will wince every time you write ""your"" when you mean ""you are"", or ""loose"" when you mean ""lose"", or use ""optima"" as if it's singular.<p>A while ago (I've spent 10 minutes searching - can't find it - reference appreciated) someone submitted the article about Joshua Bell playing at a train station - and, in essence, no one listened.  The ""frame"" was all wrong.<p>If your writing is littered with errors, a large number of people won't listen to you, even if what you say is of great value.<p>This is especially harsh if you're writing in a second, or even third, language, but the point remains.  Please, when writing for publication, take the time to proof-read and correct, and get someone else to read with a critical eye.<p>It's worth it.",1257334028

If we where a democracy, I did not get to vote, because I was not allowed to see the text of the subject to make an informed decision.<p>Anyway, we are not a democracy we are a republic which is evident by the fact that I did not get a vote on the issue.

921483,comment,920110,921391,0,0,alan-crowe,,,"Thank you for expanding on that. In trying see the relevance of PGP's web of trust to Outer Circle, two things throw me off the scent.<p>First, identity in Outer Circle is simply a public key used to decode each signed post. When an identity is highly regarded, others will wish to impersonate it, in order to get their writing or advertisements read, but they are unable to do so because they do not know the private key.<p>Prevention of passing off is the whole of identity in Outer Circle. We do not care if users have multiple accounts nor do we care whether group accounts are acknowledged or pretend to be an individual. Circle jerks, be they conspiracies or sock puppets, do not undermine the Outer Circle system because an identity, even in good standing, has no <i>right</i> of recommendation. If some-one on your direct list starts reading crap you ""shallow"" him or drop him, and that is part of the normal operation of the system as tastes change (his or yours) or time pressures squeeze.<p>So it is confusing to me to read about web of trust because Outer Circle has no notion of who somebody really is. Ossian is welcome.<p>Second is Outer Circles core concept of the coexistence of incompatible through invisibility. Whether somebody is who he says he is is a valid concept that is either true or false. I see the idea that a post is worth reading or not worth reading is a trap. There is no truth of the matter and that is the heart of the reason that traditional forums with moderation and meta-moderation collapse. They are trying to forge a consensus when they should be facilitating disagreement.<p>You doubt the value in keeping a medium that is 99% nonsense usable for the last few erudite users. That foregrounds the issue of scaling. I picture Outer Circle growing from a thousand elite users to million users, 99% hoi polloi 1% elite. So the proportion of erudite users falls, but the absolute number rises tenfold. I see the endless migration of the nomadic elite as an important problem, preventing them reaching critical mass.<p>Do you still think that PGP's web of trust is relevant? How do I relate ""is john@example.org who he says he is"", which has type <i>boolean</i>, to ""john is worth readng"", which has type <i>function from users to boolean</i>?",1257332714

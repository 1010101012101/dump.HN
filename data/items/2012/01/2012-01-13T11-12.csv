3460159,story,,,1,0,unsafedrugs,"Fosamax Lawsuit",http://www.unsafedrugs.com/801/fosamax-lawsuit-2,"Many lawsuits have been filed recently by people who used Fosamax to treat their osteoporosis, but later found that Fosamax has damaged their bone health.  These unexpected adverse effects have most frequently surfaced as problems in the jaw bone or the femur.<p>Fosamax is a drug that reduces the chance of having a hip or spinal fracture.  It has become the drug of choice for doctors who want to prescribe something for the prevention of osteopenia, a precursor to osteoporosis. Osteopenia is the word used to describe loss of bone density.<p>The term osteopenia became popular in medical literature about the same time as the drug Fosamax came into the open market. Osteopenia is a condition characterized by lower than normal bone mineral density (BMD), where the BMD is not low enough to be classified as osteoporosis. In patients with osteopenia there is a greater risk that as time passes, they may develop osteoporosis. Bones naturally become thinner as people grow older and the existing bone cells are reabsorbed by the body faster than new bone is made. A common consequence of porous bones is fractures. Although osteoporosis is often considered to be a womans disease, osteoporosis also affects many men. This condition results in brittle bones owing to the loss of calcium and other mineral components, sometimes resulting in pain, decreased height, and skeletal deformities. It is also associated with long-term steroid therapy and certain endocrine disorders.<p>To address these common problems, doctors have  long sought an effective treatment or a means of preventing such conditions from ever developing. Pharmaceutical companies have also tried to develop a cure. Fosamax, also known as alendronic acid or alendronate sodium, is one such drug and is famous for the dramatic results it produces. But, like all drugs, Fosamax too has side effects. The only difference is, its side effects are disastrous and the losses it causes are irreversible.<p>As a result, thousands of lawsuits are filed against Merck  the company that produces and markets Fosamax. It has been alleged by the claimants that Fosamax when taken by osteoporosis patients has been found to result in low-stress femur fractures and ONJ (osteonecrosis of jaw).<p>More and more research is being conducted on the link between Fosamax and these side effects, and many case studies have been published that illustrate the problem. However, there are some differences of opinion among the researchers about exact mechanism that causes the link. Nonetheless, this research and these studies are being used in an increasing number of Fosamax cases filed against Merck.  Many of these lawsuits seek compensation for atypical subtrochanteric femoral shaft fractures, commonly known as femur fractures.<p>In May 2011, Journal of Bone and Mineral Research published an article- Oral bisphosphonates and risk of subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur fractures in a population-based cohort. This study was designed to compare the relative risks of the drugs commonly prescribed to treat osteoporosis.  An abstract from the article says: There was no evidence of an increased risk of subtrochanteric or diaphyseal femur fractures in bisphosphonate users compared with raloxifene/calcitonin users. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that long-term bisphosphonate use may increase the risk of these fractures.  Thus, the study was inconclusive on the key issue of causation.<p>Bisphosphonate Use and Atypical Fractures of the Femoral Shaft is a a large Swedish cohort study, which was published by The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2011. The study found that the risk of femoral shaft fractures increased 50 times with the use of bisphosphonates for treating osteoporosis like Fosamax (alendronate), although the absolute risk of developing a femur fracture, remained very small.  This study should enable plaintiffs in the Fosamax lawsuits to meet their burden of proof, which requires evidence that the relative risk at least doubled from the use of the drug.<p>Some recent medical research regarding bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw also gives some interesting findings.  To date, there is no direct study that proves oral biophosphonates increase the risk of ONJ.  However, there is a new study confirming that there is a six-times increase in risk for ONJ among patients who receive the same drug in intravenous form.  This important bisphosphonate study was published in Abstract 890 of Medscape for International Association of Dental Research, at 89th General Session and Exhibition in March 2011.<p>In February 2011, the Journal of Dental Research published another study:  ONJ in Two Dental Practice-Based Research Network Regions.  In this study, ONJ was found to be linked with the use of all biosphosphonates, including Fosamax (alendronate).  This article concluded that patients who had used oral bisphosphonates were 15.5 times more likely to have ONJ than those who had not  although the absolute risk for ONJ from oral bisphosphonates is low.<p>These scientific studies are key pieces of the evidence that will be used to pursue claims for the users of Fosamax who suffered these devastating and debilitating adverse side effects.  If you or a loved one have suffered from a femor fracture or ONJ after taking Fosamax, let the lawyers at Powers Taylor handle your case.

With all due respect, I'm a bit confused by this statement. I agree with you that most people tend to be apathetic, and that it's hard to reach them. But I can name dozens, possibly hundreds, of examples of successful cause-based campaigns that relied on generating positive solidarity with, or good will toward the campaigner; I can name precisely zero successful campaigns that relied on deliberately pissing people off at the campaigner.<p><i>""The rage keeps moving further up the tree of effects until something happens.""</i><p>I just don't see that happening.

http://blog.mocality.co.ke/files/2012/01/Incoming_Call-Redacted-20111221-1133502.pdf
=============================================
Im very proud of the business that weve created here at Mocality, but Im especially proud of two things:<p>1. Our crowdsourcing program. When we started this business, we knew that (unlike in the UK or US, where you can just kickstart your directory business with a DVD of business data bought from a commercial supplier), if we wanted a comprehensive database of Kenyan business, we would have to build it ourselves. We knew also that if we wanted to build the business quickly, wed have to engage a lot of Kenyans to help us. So we built our crowd program that utilises M-PESA (Kenyas ubiquitous Mobile Money system) to reward any Kenyan with a mobile phone who contributes entries to our database, once those entries have been validated by our team. Over two years, weve paid out Ksh. 11m (over $100,000) to thousands of individuals, and we have built Kenyas most comprehensive directory, with over 170,000 verified listings. Personally, I regard the program as one of THE highlights of my 18 year career on the internet.
2. From day 1, we aimed to target all Kenyan businesses, irrespective of size. As a result, for about 2/3rds of our listed businesses, Mocality is their first step onto the web. Thats about 100,000 businesses that Mocality has brought online.<p>Please bear these two facts in mind as you read what follows.<p>Our database IS our business, and we protect and tend it very carefully. We spot and block automated attacks, amongst other measures. We regularly contact our business owners, to help them keep their records up-to-date, and they are welcome to contact our call centre team for help whenever they need it.<p>In September, Google launched Getting Kenyan Businesses Online (GKBO). Whilst we saw aspects of their program that were competitive, we welcomed the initiative, as Kenya still has enough growth in it that every new entrant helps the overall market. We are also confident enough in our product, our local team, and our deep local commitment that we believe we can hold our own against any competition, playing fair.<p>Shortly after that launch, we started receiving some odd calls. One or two business owners were clearly getting confused because they wanted help with their website, and we dont currently offer websites, only a listing. Initially, we didnt think much of it, but the confusing calls continued through November.<p>==========================
The Forensic analysis
==========================<p>What follows is necessarily a little technical. Ive tried to make it as clear as I can, but two definitions may help the lay reader:<p><pre><code>    IP Address  the numerical id by which computers identify themselves online.
    User-Agent - When a browser requests a page from a webserver, it tells the server what make, model, and version of browser it is, so that the webserver can serve content tailored to that browsers capabilities. Webservers keep a log of both these details for every page requested, allowing us to do interesting detective work.
</code></pre>
If youre not interested in the technical details, you can always jump straight to the Conclusion.<p>At the start of December we analysed our server logs to look for a common pattern for the businesses that had contacted us with these confused calls. We found a single IP/ User-Agent combination that had accessed all these businesses:<p>=================================
IP Address: 41.203.221.138<p>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686) AppleWebKit/535.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/14.0.835.186 Safari/535.1
=======================================================<p>The user agent is unusual for Kenya: the stable version of Google Chrome released on 20 September 2011, running on 32-bit Linux. With the exception of this IP, it barely appears in our logs.<p>We looked up the ownership record for 41.203.221.138 via WHOIS.<p>=======================================================================

=======================================================================
So a Kenyan ISP. But how were they accessing us? We did some analysis.
Graph of accesses to Mocality.com from 41.203.221.138<p>Of the 65,851 requests, there were 33,261 requests to a Business Profile page, i.e. accessing the contact details for a business.<p>Further details:<p><pre><code>    No evidence of automated scraping, this appears to be a team of humans.

    Since 3 Nov, requests originate from a WIMAX connection in Nairobi (41.203.221.138). Prior to that, various addresses.

    Business profile requests are referred by Mocality search result pages having 100 results/page

    Peak rates are 2500 pages per day (1.73 per minute)

    The User-Agent originated from many different IPs starting on 4 September, started scraping on 12 October, abrubtly stopped on 29 October, resumed on 3 November from the Safaricom Wimax IP.

    Pattern of access is mainly 8am-6pm Weekdays, a few hours on Saturday, and never Sunday.
    No other non-robot (IP,User-Agent) combination has such a pattern of activity at that scale (2500/day).
</code></pre>
So a person or (judging by the access rate) team of people were systematically accessing our database, during office hours, and it looked like they moved into a new office over the weekend at the start of November. But who were they, and what were they doing?
The Sting<p>We decided to find out. We made some changes to the site:<p>For visitors from the 41.203.221.138 address, we changed the code to serve slightly different content 10% of the time.
Instead of the real business phone number, we served a number that fed through to our call centre team, where the incoming calls would also be recorded. Our team were briefed to act like the business owners for the calls.<p>We switched the new code on December 21st.<p>When we listened to the calls, we were beyond astonished.
Results<p>Id like you to meet Douglas. On this call (first 2 minutes) you can clearly hear Douglas identify himself as Google Kenya employee, state, and then reaffirm, that GKBO is working in collaboration with Mocality, and that we are helping them with GKBO, before trying to offer the business owner a website (and upsell them a domain name). Over the 11 minutes of the whole call he repeatedly states that Mocality is with, or under (!) Google.<p>Between 10am and 1pm on December 21st, we received 6 others just like it (from 5 different Google Kenya employees) before switching back to normal service. We estimate that this team were calling 20-25 Mocality business per hour, since 7 calls over 3 hours, only 10% of calls redirected: 7*10/3= 23.3. calls/hour)<p>On all calls, the same script is followed  A Google Kenya employee calls a Mocality business and tries to deceive them into signing up for their competing product, by claiming that we are working together.<p>It gets worse: Heres a complete transcript ( with translation of the kiSwahili portions) of a another call, in which the caller goes further, claiming that Mocality engages in bait-and-switch practices to try and charge businesses upto Ksh. 20,000 ($200) for their listings. Mocality has never and will never charge for listings. The irony: on the same call, the caller tries exactly that tactic for GKBOs hosting fees.<p>I have redacted the details (except first name) of both parties on the call, and highlighted key sections in YELLOW.
What happened next?<p>Having gathered our evidence, and needing to wait for transcription and translation (as parts of the conversations were in kiSwahili (the local East African language)) of the recordings , and feeling pleased with detective work, we had a lovely Christmas break. I started writing this blog post.<p>So that we had the latest stats on our return to work, we re-analysed the logs, on Monday 9th January.<p>There were no further accesses from the IP address 41.203.221.138 after 4pm 23rd December. Co-incidence? or had someone realised we were onto them?<p>However, there were some NEW strange messages from business owners- theyd apparently been contacted by a call centre in India with the same promise of a website.<p>So we reran the whole analysis. We quickly identified a new IP/User-Agent combination.

Search for tag=mo.request 74.125.63.33 from 20 December 2011 to 9 January 2012. Found 17,049 requests<p>Graph of accesses to Mocality.com from 74.125.63.33<p>On 10th January, we re-enabled the Sting code. Again, within a couple of hours, wed received calls from the new call centre to our dummy numbers.<p>Here is Deepthi, from Google India. On this call, you can hear her talking about her partnership with Mocality, and offering us a free website.<p>It looks like Google has now outsourced the Getting Kenya Businesses Online operation to India!<p>Conclusion<p>Since October, Googles GKBO appears to have been systematically accessing Mocalitys database and attempting to sell their competing product to our business owners. They have been telling untruths about their relationship with us, and about our business practices, in order to do so. As of January 11th, nearly 30% of our database has apparently been contacted.<p>Furthermore, they now seem to have outsourced this operation from Kenya to India.<p>When we started this investigation, I thought that wed catch a rogue call-centre employee, point out to Google that they were violating our Terms and conditions (sections 9.12 and 9.17, amongst others), someone would get a slap on the wrist, and life would continue.<p>I did not expect to find a human-powered, systematic, months-long, fraudulent (falsely claiming to be collaborating with us, and worse) attempt to undermine our business, being perpetrated from call centres on 2 continents.<p>Google is a key part of our business strategy. Mocality will succeed if our member businesses are discoverable by people via Google. We actually track how well our businesses place on Google as a key metric, and have always regarded it as a symbiotic relationship. We are in the business of creating local Kenyan content that Google can sell their adwords against. More than 50% of our non-direct traffic comes via Google (paid or organic). For us, the cost of going elsewhere is NOT zero.<p>Furthermore, we spend a very significant sum on advertising with Google Kenya. I wouldnt be surprised if we are one of their largest local customers, between Mocality and our sister site Dealfish.co.ke.<p>Kenya has a comparatively well-educated but poor population and high levels of unemployment. Mocality designed our crowd sourcing program to provide an opportunity for large numbers of people to help themselves by helping us. By apparently systematically trawling our database, and then outsourcing that trawl to another continent, Google isnt just scalping us, theyre also scalping every Kenyan who has participated in our program.<p>I moved to Africa from the UK 30 months ago to be CEO of Mocality. When I moved, Kenyas reputation as a corrupt place to do business made me nervous. Ive been very happily surprised- until this point, Ive not done business with any company here that was not completely honestly conducted. It is important for global businesses to adapt to local cultural practice, but ethics are an invariant. As a admirer of Googles usually bold ethical stance around the world, to find those principles are not applied in Kenya is simply saddening.<p>Someone, somewhere, has some questions to answer.<p>These are my personal top 3:<p><pre><code>    If Google wanted to work with our data, why didnt they just ask?
    In discussions with various Google Kenya/Africa folks in the past, Id raised the idea of working together more closely in Kenya. Getting Kenyan businesses online is precisely what we do.
    Who authorised this? Until we uncovered the India by way of Mountain View angle, I could have believed that this was a local team that somehow forgot the corporate motto, but not now.
    Who knew, and who SHOULD have known, even if they didnt know?

    I am working on a VoIP tunneling software (http://www.mizu-voip.com/Products/VoIPTunnel.aspx) used by many telecom companies in Asia.
    In the last 3 years we have continuously evolved the built-in encryption algorithms but it was always cracked by the local authorities (yes, they are employing high qualified personnel for this). Last summer we decided to integrate much stronger encryption (at the cost of lower server performance) and since then the protocol was not cracked anymore.
   I think that since they cannot easily crack new VoIP encryption anymore, they have decided to lower the quality for all links to keep the VoIP quality low so people have to use their national telecom service at high cost.
   What do you think?

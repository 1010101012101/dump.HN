8883425,comment,8881760,8882353,0,0,kybernetikos,,,"> companies are not bound by ethics or morality.....<p>There are three mechanisms that can cause companies to prioritise ethics and morality.<p>1. The voting public encourage their representatives to change the regulatory environment <i>based on their morality</i>.  This is one reason why a whole host of unethical companies don&#x27;t exist.  Companies on the margins of morality suffer from extra risk that the regulatory environment will change too.<p>2. The customers exercising their personal morality are reluctant to buy from an unethical company, or boycott it, thus affecting the value of the company.<p>3. Key individuals find that there are moral and ethical limits to what they will do in pursuit of shareholder value, and they provide enough value in other ways that replacing them would be a net loss for the company (or activist shareholders actually share their views).  Deliberately selecting your leadership team for poor ethics is likely to have some downsides too.<p>> Individuals can have morals and ethics. If they control a company and choose to enforce their values through their company, well, that&#x27;s their choice. But if the ownership of the company changed, so would the values.<p>Exactly, and individually speaking, in my ethics, in role of voter, legislator, customer, shareholder, employee or executive of a company,  morality and ethics certainly do play into my decisions.  I believe that it is right that they should, and I expect the same of everyone.<p>In particular, you say<p>> [maximising value] is the extent of a company&#x27;s moral obligation<p>Which is an assertion without evidence that I simply disagree with.  Maximising value might well be what is promised to the shareholders, but it&#x27;s obvious that just as with all promises there is a context and limits to that.  No shareholder would expect the CEO of a company to sacrifice their life if it would increase the value of the company by a cent.  Everyone understands that the trust we have that the management of a company is trying to make money for the shareholder exists in a context, and one of the large parts of that context is morality.<p>Your earlier statement almost seemed to imply that we shouldn&#x27;t hold companies to standards of morality beyond the law, but that is just giving up.  Expecting immoral behaviour from people in particular roles is a self fulfilling prophecy, and poisons the context.",1421193548

I worked on a Korean piece of code. All the variable names were in English but the comments were in Korean. Why, just why?

Maybe you should actually read the article instead of your usual knee jerk reaction, which is always wrong.<p>The article is about Verizon making false and misleading statements to the FCC about its use of “Title II”, where it has told the FCC, the courts and the public that if the companies are ‘reclassified’ as title II in the net neutrality proceeding it would harm investment. And we nailed them, showing that their entire fiber to the premises networks are already Title II, and we are using Verizon’s own documents, which  directly contradict what they told the FCC. -- And it&#x27;s not legal to lie to the FCC.<p>Then you rant about something-- “any price increase beyond that rate is a &quot;subsidy&quot; from the public to the carrier.”<p>One day you should actually read what I wrote. Starting in the 1990’s, Verizon got regulators to change the laws to charge customers to fund fiber optic deployments – and instead now-Verizon pocketed the money and didn’t build the networks. But you don’t mind being ripped off or that from 1993-2005 there were no build outs of networks which we paid for.   And this continued with FiOS.<p>Going back to the article, not only are Verizon’s networks Title II but they did this to charge customers for these networks-- as Verizon claimed it was building out FiOS as part of the state utility telecommunications networks.  As we showed, using Title II, Verizon got the State to charge regular phone customers rate increases – well, it ain’t legal to charge phone customers for say, the roll out of a cable service. Worse, Verizon stopped the FiOS deployments so in NY state, 80% of the state municipalities, and their customers, paid for network upgrades that they’ll never get – including low income families, seniors—people who weren’t supposed to be charged.<p>Then you claim that somehow we should investigate Apple  &quot;if they subsidized iPhone development by increasing Mac prices?&quot;<p>Wha? Verizon controls essentially facilities and is still a utility network and gets the ‘rights of way’ based on a franchise. Apple is a free market company that doesn’t control any wired or wireless facilities and I can go and get any phone I want.<p>But you can’t tell the difference nor did you even bother to read the story.",1421192193

If 40% of passed houses subscribe (Verizon has been struggling to hit that number for years), you pay $2,500 per house that does subscribe. This is the &quot;uptake ratio&quot; and a fiber provider lives and dies by that number.<p>Build-out requirements tank your uptake ratio, because you spend a bunch of money passing houses where people can&#x27;t afford to subscribe. It increases how much you need to make on all the other houses to recoup your costs.<p>But your other subscribers don&#x27;t give a shit about your costs. They&#x27;re willing to pay, e.g., $100/month for triple play, and they don&#x27;t care if your per-house cost is $2,000 or $4,000. If you raise your prices to recoup your costs, they&#x27;ll just stick with the incumbent, again tanking your uptake ratio.<p>A small ISP may be willing to ask for a $10 million bank loan to wire up a yuppie neighborhood like Fells Point, with the prospect of seeing how it goes and building out from there.

So I energetically avoided calling attention to my accomplishments.<p>Eventually I came to realize that this was a little crazy. I can&#x27;t expect managers and clients and investors to automatically appreciate all the stuff that it has taken me years to learn to do well. I&#x27;ve discovered that there is a reasonable level of taking credit that is neither sleazy nor slighting of my colleagues. Being modest and self-effacing is good, but it can be taken too far.<p>So let me answer your question with some more questions: Do the executives know that you did these things well? Have you told them you wanted a position other than as a line developer? Do they know that you&#x27;re unhappy? Are you regularly discussing your career plans with them?<p>If you, like I once did, find that stuff revolting, then I&#x27;d encourage you to find someone to help you practice those conversations.

- our funds are performing substantially above median
- our performance appears to be increasing over the past 3 funds
- I doubt that most LPs have turned us down because occasionally I use some 4-letter words...<p>thanks,<p>DMC",1421190393

In the 80s and 90s, video games were for geeks. Ha, in my freshman year of college in 2001, my roommates were baffled that I would put on a headset and seemingly talk to my computer while playing a game on it?<p>Anyway, I will say the Steam Early Access program is amazing. It basically lets developers develop games in a Lean-Startup style, by releasing an MVP and then iterating on it, and it lets customers buy the game at any point to fund the development.<p>I&#x27;ve been playing Kerbal Space Program (highly recommended if you&#x27;re interested at all in spaceflight, orbital mechanics or rocketry) on the Early Release Program, and it&#x27;s just awesome. The developers are cool and are pretty at-large in the community on reddit.",1421190332

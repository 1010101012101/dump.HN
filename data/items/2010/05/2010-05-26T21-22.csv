But Dropbox it's a fantastic app in Windows and Linux too, and I guess that after PC vs Mac, Apple is going to come up with a new ad strategy ""Mac is better""-ish again.<p>Safari and iTunes for Windows (as well as iPod and iPhone) are Apple's bait to get users ditch their PCs and buy a Mac. (Well, they are substandard apps, but the intention was/is that).<p>So I guess Apple could offer the best online sync experience with Dropbox and use it to say: ""See? Now you can switch to Mac and instantly use all your documents you had on Windows! Isn't that great?""",1274911182

I for one could see myself being convinced, and even supporting, it's legalization at some point (certainly my attitude has changed in the last 12 months!). However, in realistic terms, that is not going to reduce overall crime related to the illegal drugs trade - dealers will simply shift focus to other drugs (I admit that there could well me a small reduction where dealers find it too much hassle etc.).<p>For your scenario to take affect <i>all</i> drugs have to be legalized. I cannot see a reasonable argument for making Heroin, a highly addictive <i>and</i> dangerous substance, legal. I'm fairly sure that many people behind the legalization of cannabis would feel the same way.<p>And even then I feel the problem would not go away - at least in the long term. Illegal markets will always exist. Sure we can keep legalizing them - but at what point does the danger become too great, at what point does designer drug X become too dangerous? I posit that such a point will come (given rampant legalization) and as such the illegal trade will continue to flourish.<p>Essentially what you are arguing is the idea of shifting poisonous assets (crime) elsewhere to allow positive gains in certain areas (cannabis industry/use). Which is fine but a) you have to be aware of where those poisonous assets are going to (can you control them?) and b) those assets still exist and you have to deal with them at some point.<p><i>That</i> is economics :)<p>With regards your other post, which you deleted, I can't (and wouldn't anyway!) down mod your replies [for obvious reasons] but I suspect the reason was because of the first comment - the tone of which is usually frowned on here.",1274910226

1381820,comment,1381278,1381386,0,0,cwp,,,"I did this. I lived in Ecuador for a year as a kind of sabbatical (though I'm not an academic.) Before I went I took a 6-week Spanish 101 class so I wouldn't starve, and then just muddled along as best I could. After about 3 months I had the basics down. I could ask for and follow directions, buy stuff, read and write business email, and have a conversation with someone. But socializing was hard - a conversation that involved more than one other person left me wondering what was going on, and I couldn't figure out how to say things fast enough to contribute before the the topic had changed. Also, I didn't consume media like TV or newspapers because it was too much work.<p>Then I started dating an Ecuadorian woman, and my Spanish acquisition just took off, especially when we moved in together. Like the Korean, I put in a tremendous amount of effort, although without flash cards. I did repeat everything over and over, to make sure it stayed in my head. But mostly it was just the endless necessity of communicating on a practical and intimate level about everything.<p>""Where's my blue shirt?"" 
""Why is your friend angry?"" 
""What's this letter from the electric company about?""
""When I was a kid, my grandfather gave me a baseball glove for Christmas.""
""No, I wasn't looking at that other girl.""
""There is corruption in the U.S., it's just more sophisticated than in Ecuador.""<p>The other important thing that happened was that I started watching TV with her. She was really into telenovelas and sketch comedy shows.<p>Let me tell, you telenovelas (spanish soap operas) are <i>awesome</i> for learning the language. First, the characters all have accents that convey their social position, and different novelas are made in different countries. So you get exposed to a lot of variation in pronunciation and vocabulary. On the other hand, this is TV, so everybody enunciates clearly and there's no hemming and hawing. Finally, everything is so dramatic and over-acted that you can tell what's going even without understanding the dialog. I alternated between rolling my eyes and concentrating furiously to catch all the nuances.<p>After a year, I was pretty much fluent in Spanish, though not quite at the level of the Korean's mastery of English. I have an idea of what kind of effort would be required to get to that level, but since I'm not in Ecuador any more, I haven't bothered. My wife and I speak both English and Spanish around the house, but we try to keep it to one language at a time - not always easy.<p>So yeah, marrying a Spanish speaker was an enormous aid to learning the language.

I list the stock and the board of directors, and site members can submit their political opinions about how they think the corporate officers are acting. In addition, I write a program to go out and find the FaceBook, Twitter, etc accounts for these officers and I list them with the stocks.<p>Not wanting to do a lot of data entry, I find a database on an ftp site somewhere that has stocks and the corporate officers that are related to them. It is part of some huge system dedicated to do something completely different, like a brokerage system or a  system for investing. Although they provide the data openly, on each dump there is a notice about how you can't use the information for commercial purposes (but you are free to use for personal purposes and/or download, copy, and give to friends) Their price is $50K. For that amount of money, you <i>might</i> be able to use <i>part</i> of the data, depending on what your actual needs are (translated: we want to know how much we can get out of you, so we're not committing to anything)<p>Do I have to physically type in each stock and the directors? And then update it all the time? When there are multiple sources of publicly-available information that gives me the same thing? That sounds crazy.<p>I was speaking with another HNer just now. He said if I downloaded the database tables I needed directly that was bad. But if I crawled a site created from the database from the static information located on each stock's page, then that was different. I say that matters of fact -- which people are officers for which company -- cannot be copyrighted. It would be different if I were pulling down big hunks of the database and reusing/re-purposing them, but I'm only asking a simple question about information that is very widely distributed.<p>So who is more right here?

By now I can read novels etc. in Spanish without too much effort.<p>Maybe I would have been able to learn Spanish even faster by using a more boring method. But then the cost would have been much, much higher for me - being bored for endless hours on end is a very high price to pay.<p>And I'm pretty sure that I would have given Spanish up a long time ago if I had followed that route.",1274907678

I'm no Cassandra expert, but I believe the default is to fsync() the commit log periodically, but to allow operations to return successfully before an fsync() has occurred. There's also a mode to require fsync() before returning success for an operation.<p><a href=""http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Durability"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Durability</a>",1274907677

4960076,comment,4950454,4955522,1,0,TheMonarch,,,"Well, there is no guidebook for this kind of thing. I don't know what to tell you. THere are probably people who know how to accomplish what you are trying to do, but I don't know how to advise you past this point.<p>The takeaway is that while you sound like you are probably a solid developer who's passionate about good software dev practices, the thing you need to work on is people skills, and the politics on how to get what you want. Basically you have a set of things you want to see done from a tech perspective, but now you need to figure out how to effect that change in the company you're in. It's not as easy as it sounds. It's not as easy as explaining the benefits to people. A lot of times, to be honest, I've felt very passionate about something and when it came time to try to convince others, I couldn't really convince them and it was really frustrating. The only thing you can do in those cases is to learn to be less rigid about it. If it's going to bother so much that youa re going to keep stickling about it, you might better off working somewhere else.<p>I learned that I am sometimes very rigid in how I want things done, but that is only my idealized version of how thing should be. The rest of the team may not want to adopt my ideas, so I had to learn to accept that. There is the perfect way of doing things, an then there is how things are done in real life. Everyone has different motivations. Sometimes people just aren't into their software dev jobs, sometimes they just know software as they learned it years ago and don't want to learn to do things the ""right"" way, or don't want to learn new technologies. Sometimes the motivations are political. Sometimes it is possible. I think it's often impossible to effect change if the ""rockstars"" aren't in agreement, often as we discussed before, because they don't want the guys lower on the totem pole showing them up by improving things.<p>It sounds like you have reached a dead end. You can either figure out how to do it on your own, which will take soft skills. You won't do it by convincing anyone that your ideas are technically the right way to do things. People generally don't care about that in the real/business world. You will have to learn to influence people, to convince them to do things they aren't into. One of the ways I know of is to do the pocket of excellence and make the team dependent on your way of doing things, and then when they are dependent on it, expand, and formalize it. The CI server is running in a VM on your workstation. You just use it and set it up, and make sure everyone on the team can access it. When they want a build, you send them a link to the URL for your CruiseControl instance (o whatever CI tool). They want to fix a piece of code you are in charge of? If they code a bug, make a unit test and ask them to write code to make the test pass. Just set things up the way you want as much as possible an force people to use it. Don't give them a choice. If yuo try to have a discussion in which you envision people agreeing with your way of doing things, that will never work. Just force them to move in the right direction by doing it. Managers aren't as powerful as you might think. The team generally does what they want. The worst that could happen is they ask you to cease and desist, but they probably won't because they probably know that you are a good contributor and they will have to put up with your desire to do things ""right"".<p>That's it, basically is to keep trying, but don't try to argue verbally, just put stuff in place and don't give people a choice, or you can find other employment. Focus on small things, and 1-2 changes at a time, you don't want to change everything at once.<p>Hope this helps.",1356285538

As a result, I hear nothing and then bursts of several instances of the sound playing at once, which sounds awful. As others have pointed out, the lag might be because you're invoking local storage after every keyup event. I see the merit in that idea, but as AskHugo suggested, it runs a lot smoother if you save every 2 seconds. I don't think anyone would complain about losing a maximum of the past 2 seconds of their work.<p>Sound effects are always going to be a polarizing feature (some like it, some hate it), and the comments on this post prove that.

4960059,comment,4959803,4959803,24,0,bmmayer1,,,"As a member of Generation Y, it is hard to have much sympathy for the ""plight"" of GenY compared to pretty much any other generation in world history.  We haven't been drafted into foreign wars or had to suffer through a real depression.  A third of us didn't die in an influenza epidemic.  Our women and minorities haven't had to face entrenched and legally immovable workplace discrimination.  We have had to face no real looming foreign threat, let alone a nuclear one.  Most of us (who are called ""GenY"") didn't have to escape persecution or immigrate with $1 in our pockets with a chance of being turned back at the border, or get spat on by natives when we arrived.<p>With the help of technology, the Pax Americana and a stable world order, improved healthcare, reduced social barriers and relative economic stability, the generation born in the 80's to 90's is probably the most privileged. Generation. Ever. In history. For 15,000 years of human civilization.  I mean, it's now considered normal (and even a human right by some) to take 2-3 weeks vacation every year.  So when I read that ""I got a $150,000 education and now I have to work for only $40,000,"" or (as I've heard before), ""I have a college education, I shouldn't be working at Pier One,"" I just want to vomit.  My immigrant grandparents would have killed for the chance to work at Pier One.  The world doesn't owe you a living because you graduated from a top tier school with a degree in Environmental Studies, or even took out a loan to go to law school.<p>Look, it's not like Generation Y--or, specifically, individuals in Generation Y like in every generation--don't have any problems, but you have to have a sense of perspective.  Success for any generation has always been about hard (productive) work, to better one's self and one's family.  The American Dream has always been about being born into rags and working into to riches, not from being born into riches and being owed something by the virtue of your privilege, which is what this ""death of the American Dream"" nonsense is about.  By this article's own admission, we've been so warped by our parents' relative privilege that it's hard to see the big picture.  Look at the big picture.",1356285268

4960038,comment,4958640,4958640,19,0,pcwalton,,,"Freestanding, ABI-level interoperability with C is planned for Rust, but is not yet implemented. There are two main reasons why being able to be called with dlsym() was less important for us than the current setup:<p>1. M:N scheduling. We wanted high scalability with hundreds of thousands or millions of tasks, which means we need the capability to have our own scheduler. OS threads aren't lightweight enough for this, especially on Windows, where over 80% of our Firefox users are. Having our own scheduler means we need our own ABI. We would like to make the scheduler optional, but getting it working was a higher priority than making it optional.<p>2. Safety. On many platforms (basically, anything but MSVC on Windows), the C stack is not bounds-checked; either there is no guard page or the guard page is unreliable because you can overshoot it. This is not acceptable for our Rust code, since stack overflows are a frequent source of exploitable security vulnerabilities for us. So we do our own stack management with a custom ABI that performs stack checks at every function entry, freeing us from this source of pain on all operating systems. Again, this is planned to be optional, but it was more important at this early stage for us to demonstrate advantages over C than for us to duplicate its ABI exactly.<p>Many libraries, however, would prefer direct interoperability with C to M:N scheduling or stack overflow safety. So we plan to provide a mechanism for Rust code to be called from C without having to set up a scheduler or perform stack checks. It's not implemented yet, but it's very much part of the current design, and I would be thrilled to see it happen.",1356284746

If you're looking for a good book that focuses more on how game theory is actually used in practice versus the more computational exposition here, then I'd recommend a very readable and cheap book called ""Game Theory for Applied Economists"" by Robert Gibbons (Google Preview: <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8ygxf2WunAIC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books/p/princeton?id=8ygxf2WunAIC</a>). The book has only 4 chapters which cover the 4 different types of games:<p>1. Static Games of Complete Information<p>2. Dynamic Games of Complete Information<p>3. Static Games of Incomplete Information<p>4. Dynamic Games of Incomplete Information<p>This segmentation covers all possible types of games. It's great because then you only have to decide if the game is static vs. dynamic and whether it's a game of complete vs. incomplete information (remember, perfect/imperfect information is not the same as complete/incomplete information). If you can answer those 2 questions, then you know what kind of equilibrium is relevant. For example, if it's a game of incomplete information (meaning that there is a move of nature, or equally, that the players don't necessarily know the types/payoffs of the other players) then you know that you are playing a Bayesian game, and hence the equilibrium (it if exists) will be some kind of a Bayesian Nash equilibrium.<p>You can always express a game of incomplete information as a game of imperfect information (see: Harsanyi transformation). However, here's something to think about: What do you lose when you transform a game from extensive form (a tree) to strategic form (a matrix)? The answer: Timing.",1356283440

The ministry said that would be an ""ingenious provision"" to save lives, but it would be against ""the whole object of constructing a road free from congested traffic"".<p>On 21 July 1938 the protestors filed across Western Avenue from the Approach, and then back, causing a huge tailback. The next day the Ministry arranged to build two bridges, one here and one by Gipsy Corner, much to the disgust of the protestors, who thought it would encourage cars to drive faster and to force pedestrians off more roads onto bridges and subways. A week later a thousand people demonstrated again for ""their right to cross on the level"".<p>In September the hastily erected bridge was complete, and five hundred people demonstrated against it again. The bridge became a tourist attraction and it was ""quite usual to see people from other districts coming to look at it"".<p>In October torchlight processions were held on the road every evening for a week, with a dog with a red light attached to it and four bearers carrying a coffin, and placards saying ""We want crossings not coffins"".",1356282045

Difficult to read the data with that solution though, if it had one JS API, it would become more useful...",1356282014

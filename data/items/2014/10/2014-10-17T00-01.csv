8468847,comment,8467062,8467961,0,0,lnanek2,,,"Honestly, I know countless gamers who play as women to get free stuff from men. I know if a woman was interested in applying for my engineering school she was flown in and wined and dined and met and fawned over by the deans. All the women&#x27;s sports teams were fully funded and the men&#x27;s teams all had to run charity events and sell tickets just to afford equipment. Women have a massive advantage in college applications and college programs in general. I can easily see people going through whatever legal requirements necessary to check female instead of male on their college application. Countless people already fake ADD symptoms to get Adderall to do better on tests. Why do you think they would identify as trans woman anywhere outside getting into college and experience any disadvantages?",1413507562

Because the Normans could only ever wield limited power at the state level, they could never fundamentally change the way the content was run at a local level.  So citizen assemblies and English common law continued and was never replaced with continental law, the final iteration of which is based on napoleanic code.  Thus in England, and her spun-off colonies, you&#x27;re fundamentally free to do your own thing unless there is a specific law against it, while most other places state that you can only do something if there law explicitly states it.<p>This fantastic inheritance was all bequeathed to the citizens of those countries with legal systems based on common law precisely because England had a weak central government which reduced the ability of a king to control everyone, especially when that was a foreign king who had invaded.",1413506669

But like all practical low-latency systems, Tor does not protect against such a strong adversary. Instead, we assume an adversary who can observe some fraction of network traffic; who can generate, modify, delete, or delay traffic; who can operate onion routers of his own; and who can compromise some fraction of the onion routers.<p>> In low-latency anonymity systems that use layered encryption, the adversary&#x27;s typical goal is to observe both the initiator and the responder. By observing both ends, passive attackers can confirm a suspicion that Alice is talking to Bob if the timing and volume patterns of the traffic on the connection are distinct enough; active attackers can induce timing signatures on the traffic to force distinct patterns. Rather than focusing on these traffic confirmation attacks, we aim to prevent traffic analysis attacks, where the adversary uses traffic patterns to learn which points in the network he should attack.<p>> Our adversary might try to link an initiator Alice with her communication partners, or try to build a profile of Alice&#x27;s behavior. He might mount passive attacks by observing the network edges and correlating traffic entering and leaving the network — by relationships in packet timing, volume, or externally visible user-selected options. The adversary can also mount active attacks by compromising routers or keys; by replaying traffic; by selectively denying service to trustworthy routers to move users to compromised routers, or denying service to users to see if traffic elsewhere in the network stops; or by introducing patterns into traffic that can later be detected. The adversary might subvert the directory servers to give users differing views of network state. Additionally, he can try to decrease the network&#x27;s reliability by attacking nodes or by performing antisocial activities from reliable nodes and trying to get them taken down — making the network unreliable flushes users to other less anonymous systems, where they may be easier to attack. We summarize in Section 7 how well the Tor design defends against each of these attacks.<p>From the Tor proposal: <a href=""https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-design.html#subsec:threat-model"" rel=""nofollow"">https://svn.torproject.org/svn/projects/design-paper/tor-des...</a>",1413506053

Their joint point of view as expressed in the review article published today is not the exact point of view of all researchers in the field, but I thought it would do as a discussion-starter here on Hacker News.<p>&quot;A crucial detail (Deary and Plomin would both agree about this, but it hasn&#x27;t come up in the discussion here yet) is that heritablity has NOTHING to do with modifiability. It is quite possible in principle that a novel environmental intervention might be discovered that could boost most people&#x27;s intelligence. It is even possible that the most effective intervention might have a gene-environment (G × E) interaction such that the intervention would most help people with lowest IQ, and least help people who already have high IQs. No such intervention that human beings can direct purposefully has yet been found, but it is clear from the Flynn effect[1] that something in the environment can have powerful effects in raising average IQ levels of whole countries, as has happened in the developed world throughout the last century (for as long as IQ tests have been around).<p>&quot;It is correct that people marry and have children on bases other than just shared level of intelligence. (But living in the same town, and completing higher education at similar ages, and pursuing compatible occupations for marriage, etc. is correlated with IQ.) It is still far too early to say how rapidly human populations might see noticeable effects from assortative mating by IQ. It is reasonably clear that often-feared dysenic trends probably are NOT happening--the lowest-IQ people in the world population don&#x27;t reproduce at all, and high-IQ people actually have reasonable numbers of children to replicate their genes. In any event, the favorable environmental trends have SWAMPED whatever genetic trends are going on for IQ in the whole human population, and people are getting smarter all over the world, according to the research on the Flynn effect.<p>&quot;It is still a hard problem to identify anything at all meaningful and replicable about how gene differences influence IQ differences, even though it is now settled wisdom that they do. Human IQ, as the article says, is influenced by MANY genes, and many of those genes interact with one another in ways that are not understood at all yet.&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_higher_than_our_grandparents"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ted.com/talks/james_flynn_why_our_iq_levels_are_...</a><p><a href=""http://blog.ted.com/2013/09/26/further-reading-on-the-flynn-effect/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.ted.com/2013/09/26/further-reading-on-the-flynn-...</a>",1413505039

Here&#x27;s why:<p>In this lecture, we heard about DoorDash, a successful delivery business that is now expanding to multiple cities.<p>DoorDash adds value by delivering more efficiently than small businesses can on their own.<p>An example of a small business that benefits is a Palo Alto Macaroon store. Before DoorDash, the Macaroon store took orders by phone and recorded them by hand in a thick notebook. Then, when there was time, the owner of the Macaroon store would personally deliver orders out of their personal car. No additional cars were ever purchased and no drivers were ever hired.<p>One key factor is causing DoorDash to succeed where others have failed: mobile phones. The ubiquity of smartphones has enabled DoorDash to hire and coordinate part-time contractors with personal cars. This new development makes the service cheaper than past competitors.<p>Now, you may be wondering what my point is. Why am I summarizing the pitch we heard from DoorDash?<p><i>Because it&#x27;s all about SCALING!</i><p>Let me explain.<p>+DoorDash is startup. By definition, that means it wants to <i>scale</i>.<p>+DoorDash is expanding to multiple cities. I.e., it is <i>scaling</i>.<p>+The businesses it helps are those who otherwise deliver at low volume with a phone and notebook. I.e., in a way that doesn&#x27;t <i>scale</i>.<p>+DoorDash has no proprietary technology and is not a monopoly (Peter Thiel disapproves, by the way). DoorDash is competing on one main dimension: cost. And how do they achieve lower cost than a mom & pop macaroon shop? By <i>scaling</i>. Operating at <i>scale</i> is their main competitive advantage.<p>+And why is DoorDash succeeding now, when past delivery start ups have failed? Because of mobile technology. And what is mobile technology letting them do? Manage a fleet of drivers <i>at scale</i>.<p>+DoorDash is a software company and software companies are eating the world. Why are software companies eating the world? Because software <i>scales</i>!<p>DoorDash&#x27;s words say to &quot;do things that don&#x27;t scale.&quot; But DoorDash&#x27;s actions say the opposite. Scaling is the key to their business.<p>(Incidentally, DoorDash gave an example of something that they claim doesn&#x27;t scale: writing personalized notes to customers after orders. But guess what? That totally scales!)<p>Can someone explain why so much more emphasis is placed on doing things that don&#x27;t scale? Doing things that scale seems to be more important to me.<p>Edit: I don&#x27;t mean to be harsh. I&#x27;m honestly curious and hoping to open up a discussion. The emphasis on not scaling seriously puzzles me. I&#x27;m sure you folks have great ideas that I&#x27;m missing.",1413504893

8468642,comment,8464304,8464304,0,0,tokenadult,,,"I somehow missed this thread at first. Reading through the comments here, I see several comments that express the correct idea, but without the key word, of &quot;pleiotropy,&quot; that is a gene (or gene assemblage) having more than one effect on phenotype. Some of the breeding examples mentioned in other comments already provide the warning: if we select human gene assemblages to maximize IQ scores (or something that can link even more directly to what we call &quot;intelligence&quot; in the real world outside the testing room), we may or may not produce healthy human beings, depending on what the pleiotropic effects of those gene assemblages are. Right now we just don&#x27;t know. An article in the Nature Scitable collection explains what pleiotropy is in more detail.[1]<p>I see that the author of the article kindly submitted here has just joined HN to join the discussion. I would respectfully suggest that the idea of &quot;Crudely speaking, IQs of order 1,000, if the scale were to continue to have meaning,&quot; should be amended with a discussion of how IQ scores of 1,000 can&#x27;t possibly exist, and surely wouldn&#x27;t have meaning. That&#x27;s because IQ scores are not derived from an interval scale, but rather an ordinal scale.[2]<p>I read the story &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; when I was a kid too, and it was a very moving story, and the author did a reasonably good job of researching theories of psychology for his era. But his account of a mentally retarded (today we would say &quot;intellectually disabled&quot;) adult having some kind of treatment that raised his IQ immensely is, at bottom, a made-up story, and the author was actually more clever than many of his readers in suggesting what is uncertain about what IQ scores mean. (He has some of his characters debate with one another about that, as I noticed when I reread the story in the last year.)<p>We know Richard Feynman&#x27;s IQ as a historical matter.[3] Feynman&#x27;s IQ of 125 was above average, of course, but not astoundingly high. There are several Nobel Prize winners in physics with an IQ at a similar level, and plenty of physicists with higher IQs who never achieve as much in physics research as a Nobel laureate does. The uniform conclusion of ALL researchers who have looked at the relationship between IQ scores and scientific research achievement is that other personal qualities besides IQ matter a lot for research breakthroughs.<p>One personal quality that is too little tapped by IQ testing is the habit of mind called &quot;rationality.&quot; Amazing, that does not correlate especially strongly with IQ.[4] Improving &quot;mindware,&quot; the ways that people think and how they reality-check their own thinking, may have a more powerful effect for human progress than merely increasing IQ. James R. Flynn, the dean of living researchers on human intelligence, suggests some strategies for improving thinking.[5] Being old enough to remember many gee-whiz promises about human genetic investigations that didn&#x27;t pan out, for the moment I will bet on Flynn&#x27;s approach providing more long-term benefit for humankind than the approach of looking for genome-wide associations with IQ.[6]<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/pleiotropy-one-gene-can-affect-multiple-traits-569"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/pleiotropy-one-gene...</a><p>[2] See the references collected at<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Ordinal_scale"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement#Ordinal_s...</a><p>or<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#Variance_in_individual_IQ_classification"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#Variance_in_...</a><p>and note the diversity of cited authors, who all agree that IQ scores are ordinal rather than interval numbers.<p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#IQ_classification_and_genius"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IQ_classification#IQ_classific...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.yalebooks.com/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300164626"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yalebooks.com/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=978030016462...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-104556.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/PressRelease/pressReleaseId-10...</a><p>[6] &quot;Most Reported Genetic Associations with General Intelligence Are Probably False Positives&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498585/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3498585/</a><p>&quot;Understanding the Genetics of Intelligence: Can Height Help?

Defining away all undefined behavior via the runtime system (e.g. NaCl or asm.js) requires a sophisticated runtime and incurs a performance penalty.<p>The first explains why C and C++ compilers cannot catch all undefined behavior.

3686161,comment,3685444,3686049,7,0,sidww2,,,"> That's a standard technical person bias.<p>First of all - I wouldn't count being a businessperson as liberal arts.<p>One way you can look at it is how many people drop out of technical subjects because they find them too hard to move to humanities and liberal arts vs. the opposite. Anecdotally, for me the former number has been much larger. The latter number has been 0.<p>Similarly, I've had many technical friends who took liberal arts courses and generally did very well in them. I also have many liberal arts friends who took technical courses and did not do well in them. In addition, the technical people I've met have been much much more hard-working than liberal arts people. (An exception I'd make is creative arts - people I've encountered in that field have generally been extremely hard-working. Also no one I've met has moved from say math to music because they found math too hard.)<p>Now it might just be because liberal arts people just don't like the technical subject matter on average as much as technical people like the liberal arts subject matter. But even if that's true, one is then right to choose technical people over liberal arts people.<p>Lastly, I also know liberal arts majors who are smarter than many technical folk I've encountered but I'm talking about the general trend here.",1331330346

Two minor problems: 1) you need to clean up icons after every installation and 2) it doesn't shows <i>everything</i> when I'm typing - I need to explicitly select ""settings"" after I type ""mouse"", for example (it's tab - down - enter, not a big deal, but still). Windows 7 start screen displays all find results at once.<p>- Keyboard is your friend: Win + c for charms, Win + q for programs search, Win + w for settings search.

There's an impedance mismatch.<p>- Exposing a search interface with all the functionality and responsiveness of the web app is painful.  Sparrow does it nicely, in my opinion.<p>- You sometimes can't login and don't know why.  Sparrow does this badly.  Once, Sparrow just started putting red dots on my account and all it said was ""authentication failure"".  I actually had to dig in to Sparrow's (thankfully provided) JSON logs to see that the error message was that ""non web clients are locked out on your account"".

Imagine my mom trying to set that up.  I don't think so.<p>- Imap and SMTP aren't the most trivial of protocols to implement correctly and completely.<p>- Stupid little things.

They've done this via:<p>1) Encouraging Developers to not price free apps (this happens sometimes in review, in their literature, etc.)<p>2) Capturing device owner's credit card info at the start (so buying an app is frictionless)<p>3) Removing low-quality, buggy, copycat, and junk apps from the store via their review process<p>Google, on the other hand, has done just about everything wrong if you want to make money from paid apps. I suspect this is because Google wants to make money via in-app ad impressions and with free apps that's the only way you can make any money (in-app purchasing notwithstanding).<p>1) No review encourages spyware, copycat apps, buggy or broken apps, etc.<p>2) Android's ""return policy"" (which has since been tweaked) encourages people to pirate apps anyway (it's super easy to do so)<p>3) Initially (I'm not sure if this is still the case) you could sign up for a market account without a credit card, thus leading to a lot of friction when it came to paying for an app (entering your CC information was a royal pain).<p>Also, I share the frustration with the internal v. external/removable storage problem. Our apps are traditionally larger (content-centric, with lots of high quality images, audio, video) and have always ran into problems with Android devices' limited on-board storage.<p>This was purely a cost decision by Google and a profit decision by vendors/carriers as vendors wanted to produce devices as cheaply as possible and make a killing on SD cards - sell a device with xxxMB storage and no SD card, then force the consumer to go out and buy an overpriced SD card (usually at point of sale).<p>This all makes Android a developer-hostile environment; yes it's easier to initially get setup on Android (no provisioning profile, etc.) but it's all pain after that. If I had a choice, and didn't make cross-platform apps w/ PhoneGap, I'd write iOS apps first/only.",1331328607

On a Macbook you can directly record an actual guitar and produce an album in Pro Tools.

You don't need to change anything; they are already carved out. The White House, Capitol, Supreme Court, along with most of the museums, monuments and parks are already in federal jurisdiction.<p>> The founders created the District of Columbia in the first place; did they not intend anyone to live there?<p>Eh, it's complicated. Congress was in a reactionary mood, having recently been chased out of Pennsylvania by an angry armed militia.<p>> Statehood would still create 2 new Democratic senators out of 102, so giving the Republicans 1 extra Representative out of over 400 is hardly a ""decent plan"".<p>Well, it <i>wasn't</i> a plan for statehood. It did not award the district any Senators. It was just for a single voting member of the House.<p>> You'd have to make up the 2 senators somehow.<p>This is the part that drives me nuts. No. You really don't. For the same reason that you don't need to offset the end of Jim Crow laws by giving white people extra votes.<p>First, not everyone in DC is a Democrat. But even if they were, giving them a voice in Congress is not a gift to the DNC -- these are seats that should have been there all along.<p>> The fact that people don't accept retrocession just shows that people really want more Democrats in the Senate.<p>That's totally false. We're talking about local politics here and there are local political reasons why DC would not want to be in MD or VA and why VA and MD would not want DC. Here's a fun fact: the DC Republican Party supports statehood. And of course the DC Green/Statehood Party does. (Also consider that adding another chunk of DC residents to VA would likely turn that state from purple to blue.) This is not a partisan issue; it's about basic fairness.",1331327701

I've found their uptime to be very good.<p>Basically, Heroku launches instances of your application and then routes incoming requests to your application.  They aren't what I would call expensive, but part of that is because of the value they add.  They're managing all of their servers and making it so that you can just push your code to them and have it run.  If a box goes down, your application instance just gets re-launched on another box.  Of course, compared to Amazon EC2 instances, it's expensive.  If you're putting out a application, chances are that it uses somewhere in the range of 50MB of RAM (really anywhere from 10-250MB doesn't matter for this comment).  Amazon will give you a small instance with 1.7GB of RAM for ~$60/mo.  For $71/mo, Heroku will give you three instances of your app.  Of course, 1.7GB of RAM could fit more than just three instances of your app.<p>However, I'm not criticizing Heroku as expensive.  I just want to note for you that you're really paying for great management.<p>Whether it's good from a business perspective depends on what you're doing.  If you don't want to budget your time on managing servers, it can be wonderful to pay someone else to do that.  Many sites can probably get away with 1-4 dynos and you get the benefit that even if one box goes down, your application will stay up.  However, there are times when your business is more about efficiently using server capacity or requires more exotic setups (like having persistent local storage rather than storing things on S3).<p>They're well-liked for a reason.

I'll throw out a few, just as discussion points.<p>* Pay disparity between professor and industry; if you optimize for money, you go more industry.<p>* Papers are a key metric of success, not actual results (Which are hard to quantify)<p>* Defunding of public universities<p>* Rising cost of education vs. inflation or cost of living<p>* Students loans leaving graduates (and non-graduates) in heinous amounts of debt. It's very hard to pay your way through school now with a part-time low-wage job.<p>* Worsening average quality of incoming students causes higher burden on instructors and institutions<p>* Increasing amount of specialization; liberal arts majors can be very smart and have broad understanding, but get shafted because paying for on-the-job training is expensive.<p>* Training vs. education wars.<p>* Entitlement issues: ""I paid for this course, I should get an A"".<p>As usual, the cream is at the top, and can bring in enough money to keep things going, and can select on more than the ability to pay tuition.",1331326877

For ten thousand cars, that would be six million dollars out of about 800 million in revenue, or three quarters of a percent. Seems like that would be money well spent on developing consumer confidence in the technology and customer loyalty for the brand.<p>My prediction is that Tesla will change course on there current maintenance program. It's much better PR to offer free maintenance for the first four years, a la BMW, and then offer an extended ""Tesla Care"" warranty program that continues the coverage, similar to Apple.<p>Because a true ""concierge"" level maintenance program wouldn't nickel and dime the customer.",1349809078

Just try to imagine how a hardball from me casting aspersions on you for suspected bad or unfair (to Mozilla; ""fair"" to Google) motives might feel.<p>Thanks for the PNaCl pointer. My comment was based on LLVM bitcode having machine word size dependencies. This was an issue a while ago. I should have checked to see if it remained one.<p>This correction doesn't alter the general unreadiness of PNaCl for the web, on several fronts. Pepper is one, but PNaCl performance lagging NaCl is another. The Chrome Web Store features games ported via NaCl, for performance -- not PNaCl, which would be significantly slower. On this basis alone, it's premature for you to push PNaCl ahead of Google.<p>> This is a far more reasonable and compelling story.<p>Well, gee, thanks a ton! :-|<p>I've been telling this story clearly since Fluent in May. That you chose not to hear it and instead flung accusations and told sob-stories about big bad Mozilla is your doing, not mine.<p>Here's a final clue: <i>all</i> browser vendors, definitely including Chrome, make the rule (not an argument) ""no one gets to the machine except through our VM(s) and GC(s)"" -- outside of a few dying plugins, which are even source-licensed and co-released.<p>And that brings back my final point: NaCl is for safer plugins, which are OS-specific anyway.

C must be faster after all.<p>Well - fuck this! This is unacceptable. Fuck this ""C is the only choice if you want the best performance"" type of thinking. I want JavaScript to win this. Not because I like JavaScript, oh it can be terrible. I want JavaScript to win this because I want to be able to use a higher level language without worrying about performance.""<p>ice:\n""As far as I'm concerned, JavaScript is not the best code for anything except pushing code to the browser.""<p>We are in 100% agreement then.<p>Sure, technically (i.e. by creating a language using a lexer+aprser and some primitives in asm), any language could be used for any purpose.  The reason I said what I said about JavaScript being limited is that it was not designed that way, i.e. to do anything.  It was as you state, designed to run in a web browser.  I would love to use JavaScript from, e.g. the command prompt, outside of a browser, but it has never been easy to do that without pretending you are running a web browser (learning DOM an so forth).  The language is designed for a browser.  Is that a limitation?  To me, yes.<p>C does not have that sort of limitation.  That's all I'm saying.  And C works for many purposes right now - my OS has a vast library of C functions to do all manner of things low and high level.  And that's without even looking at other huge repositories on the web.  Compare this with mere ""theoretical"" capabilities, e.g. ideas like ""low level JavaScript"".<p>I told you why I like C and why I see JavaScript as limited.  Not to contradict anything you said, but to explain where I'm coming from.  Maybe I would like JavaScript even more than C, if I explored it more fully, but there's no way I'll like it more when it is so limited in what it can do (practically, not theoretically).  I approach computer languages from a practical standpoint.  I ask myself what can I do if I learn this language?  I concluded that for me, C opens more doors, many more doors, than JavaScript.  Some people know both.  But I'm not that smart.  I have to choose.<p>If I was smart, I'd learn many languages.  But I have to work with a smaller set of knowledge.<p>Given that I have to choose, truthfully, if I had my preference, I'd choose FORTH and devote all my effort to learning and writing in FORTH.  Technically anything is possible using FORTH.  So what?  By focusing only on FORTH I would be losing all the leverage that people's work with C can offer.  There is only so much I, with my limited smarts, could accomplish.<p>Certainly you can understand my position a little, can't you?  Why do so many people love Perl and Python?  If we took away all the libaries (=enablement, empowerment) would they still love them as much?  For what I want to do (i.e. potentially anything, from booting to browsing), C gives me ample enablement and empowerment.  Self-hosting JavaScript doesn't.\nAnd if someone writes a BIOS for ARM scriptable in JavaScript, but they write some part of it in C, well, I'm still going to want to learn C before JavaScript.  That's just how I think.",1349808130

Erlang cares about recovering from errors so it must be preemptive. Node.js trusts the programmer so it uses a much simpler cooperative scheduler. This does not change the concurrency model though, only the assumptions of the environment.<p>Erlang is (in my opinion at least) better than node.js, and also has the advantage being able to enforce no-shared-memory between actors, so it automatically distributes erlang processes across all your cpu cores. Node.js requires that you spawn child processes yourself if you wish to take advantage of multiple cores, but ones they're spawned the way you handle concurrency doesn't change.<p>I don't know about you, but mailboxes and callbacks look pretty close to the same thing to me. In both, your code waits for an event to happen and then reacts to that event, potentially sending off more events. In both, once you do anything that would require blocking, your coroutine lets others run while it's waiting.<p>The erlang model certainly has more power but they're more similar to each other than they are to anything else.

The ""shock and awe"" campaign in Iraq (a.k.a. terror bombing, as it would have been called in WWII) was a tremendous display of military might, but what did it accomplish besides ensuring that there would be lots of rebuilding work for contractors and royally pissing off the populace?  Any hope for U.S. forces to be greeted as liberators went up in Tritonal-fueled fire with that campaign.  Old-fashioned boots on the ground with constant close contact with civilians might have helped with damage-control, but that's not the U.S. military's way.  The U.S. military's way is to bunker down and send out choppers and mechanized patrols that shoot up anything that looks remotely suspicious, only to be blown to bits by an IED the locals would have told soldiers about if they had walked through instead.  Iraq is still in the grasp of terrorism (5 killed today: <a href=""http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8545451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8545451</a>) and is more anti-American than ever.<p>The latest technology to be abused is drones.  They're deadly.  They're sexy.  They're completely safe (for Americans)!  It must seem like a coup to military brass to be able to blow terrorists into a hot mess of crispy giblets without sending a single human being within a hundred kilometers of the target.  Meanwhile, civilians are killed, sovereignty of allies is violated, and enough anti-American sentiment is sown to more than make up for the deaths of a few terrorists in the long run.  Then some American pundit asks, ""Why do they hate us?"".<p>This is just the latest chapter in the U.S. military's long obsession with technology.  The Vietnam war didn't turn out the way the U.S. wanted for a host of reasons.  Just one was that the military thought they could control territory by flying from hotspot to hotspot without bothering with permanent forces on the ground.  A site would be labelled as a hotbed of enemy activity so the military would fly in several choppers full of troops and airlift in some artillery.  Those forces would typically not stray from the safe radius of artillery coverage, so all the NVA had to do was get outside that radius if they didn't want to engage.  The U.S.'s obsession with technology functionally handed complete initiative to their enemy.<p>The U.S. military needs to stop viewing wars as a proving ground for the latest high-tech killing devices and start focusing on results.  Put the toys away and focus on what works.  Get out of the humvees and apaches and walk through those contested regions, talking to people.  Yes, some will get sniped, but this is the only way to establish order, and that will save more lives in the long run.  Instead of spending billions on drones to kill terrorists in Pakistan, spend a few millions to make Pakistan want to hunt them down themselves.  In short, stop trying to solve everything with new hardware and use some brains!",1349806946

But my concerns are real.<p>Granted: Fusion energy is a conceptually simpler process that is virtually impossible to runaway by its very nature. That alone is a massive plus any way you look at it.<p>Granted: the total bulk volume of radioactive waste products is dramatically lessened.<p>Granted: the radionuclides created by a fusion reactor are likely to be less problematic than those from a fission reactor.<p>My points: There is still radioactive waste: magnetic confinement reactor liners will handle so much corrosive flux they'll essentially be disposable and replaced frequently - possibly on the order of weeks or months. Same (but lessened) story for inertial confinement reactor liners and the metallic waste products. Those have to go somewhere safe. They're not small.<p>Same story for the electrical generation system. Regardless of the final reactor type, it's still going to involve managing heat-exchange fluids with neutron exposure.<p>Then there's the environmental + carbon load from building a reactor complex, which is not going to be quantifiable until there are working reactor designs and working fuel flows and a working understanding of how much staffing and security and land and ancillary support is needed. NIMBY is going to be just as strong for fusion as it is for fission, and that's going to mean compromises.<p>Then there's going to be the cost of purifying the fuel source, which won't be negligible when it literally involves boiling the seas. Then packaging it. Then shipping it. Then handling the waste products. Then planning for  the plant's functional lifetime, which won't be forever.<p>The conceptual clarity of fusion is wonderful and I fully support the research, but the execution is going to be quite a bit less sexy and come with some well-known downsides.",1349806115

4633069,comment,4630057,4630364,10,0,BrendanEich,,,"Howdy, Bryan. A few comments.<p>First, it's not all about _moi_. As with any mature language with multiple implementations, there is a committee, Ecma TC39. It has reps from all the bigs plus PayPal (Doug Crockford) and Yahoo!. We avoid design by committee, instead focusing on paving the cowpaths and in a few cases working with champions -- single innovators or RPG's ""resonant dyads"" _a la_ ken&dmr -- to do focused design. The best example in my view is the Proxy design by Mark Miller and Tom Van Cutsem, followed by Modules by Dave Herman and Sam Tobin-Hochstadt.<p>We have a few goals, including minimizing kernel semantics and extending syntax for usability only where we have experience and positive user-testing results (e.g., destructuring, let, generators, classes as prototypal sugar a la CoffeeScript).<p>In this light, we aren't dumping new semantics into ES6. If you count fairly, we are filling the big semantic gaps in ES5 (AKA JS as we know it). For instance, where is client-side synchronous ""require"" without the ES6 module system? No fair that Node's require is sync (against all sound doctrine!). Sync XHR is from the jank-devil, and we cannot do sync require as an API client side.<p>Second, as others have noted, V8 was stealth'ed for two years (I learned of it in 2006 but Google withheld, see <a href=""https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module-owner/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://brendaneich.com/2011/06/new-javascript-engine-module...</a>) and then unleashed just as Apple and Mozilla got their JIT acts together. At the time some said V8 was 3x faster, but the actual ratio on stupid benchmarks was more like 1.3x at first.<p>V8 is an amazing piece of work, but it did not contribute to the language evolution that my ""very brief history"" slide diagrammed. It certainly contributed by being the fastest, but until after 2010, that was the extent of its influence, for several specific reasons.<p>For the first few years as open source, V8 foreswore diverging from JavaScriptCore (the first WebKit engine, Apple's fork of KJS from KHTML, which V8 in some ways forked WebKit to replace) on any new ES5 or ES6 proposals, to try to keep on (or get back on, in view of the fork) Apple's good side. Fat chance!<p>Even now, V8 still keeps prototyped ES6 implementations hidden behind a flag. I expect this flag to be lifted before ES6 is ratified.<p>Another thing that hurt: Google has moved V8 to Munich because the Aarhus team wanted to do Dart, Google explicitly chose to invest in Dart over JS, and the no-remote-teammates rule hurt. IMHO the Munich team is quite strong but only ~10 people. This limits its effectiveness compared to Chakra (~60 heads?) and even SpiderMonkey (~12, more with interns).<p>Finally, whoever thinks I disrespect V8 clearly does not listen to my talks. The video will be up, give it a view when it's live if you have time. There is no disrespect from me toward V8 or the team that built it. I do mention it favorably in all talks, including Strange Loop (if my memory serves).<p>Lars Bak did the Strange Loop first night closing keynote, which my insane schedule prevented me from attending. He and I have had no meetings since that one in 2006, although he met with some Mozilla colleagues in 2009. I bear no bad feelings, although Lars did tell a gratuitous whopper around 3:50 in this talk: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2TJYBmDZHI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2TJYBmDZHI</a> (see my blog cited above for what happened with Mozilla being ""offered"" V8 in 2006 -- Google reneged). He is the best VM hacker I know of. (Mike Pall is another superhacker of note.)<p>I hope this sheds some light. I respect V8 while noting that, as with anything human, it and the technical/product/open-source/standards politics around it show some significant flaws. That is inevitable.<p>Mozilla has flaws too, but they tend to be different in kind. For example, we do open from the start and try to partner even against long odds (e.g., Tamarin/ES4). I'm not bragging, because I think that can be a mistake. I've learned from V8 and modified Mozilla strategies accordingly.<p>So, hats off to V8!",1349806014

It is not at all uncommon for a director to at least collaborate with a screenwriter if not write the screenplay themselves. And most directors would like (although this is sometimes prohibited by the studios, e.g. in the case of Orson Welles) to have creative power if not direct control over the production and editing process.<p>However, even at this level of involvement we are a far cry from the claim that a single person is responsible for the film as a creative work.<p>For instance, you're missing a critical piece of the equation: acting. You could easily make the argument the job of an actor is as important as any role a director might have and ultimately it is the centerpiece of so much film as well as the final artist presentation. Even the most controlling directors have limited ability to hold de facto control over this aspect of the film.<p>Considering all the multitude of complexities of the process, the myth of this superhuman director here is a lot less interesting than the actual process of filmmaking, if you ask me.",1349805961

Modules are static collections of code. Very different things, especially in a dynamic language like JS. Typed objects are not even remotely related; they're a low-level API for efficiently working with structured binary data.<p>> same with macros and codegens.<p>As Yehuda says, macros are not part of ES6 but rather an experiment at <a href=""http://sweetjs.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sweetjs.org</a> to consider for future editions. I don't know what you mean by ""codegens."" Brendan's slides weren't talking about a feature, but rather an existing usage pattern that we need to serve in additional to human code-writers.<p>ES6 actually does a remarkable job covering many use cases with small modifications that smoothly integrate with the existing language. You might want to try experimenting with some of these features, many of which are implemented partly or completely in SpiderMonkey (as Brendan's latest blog post details). Most of the features are small improvements to paper cuts, and as everyone I've ever spoken to who's written SpiderMonkey-specific JavaScript attests (for example, in the Firefox front-end or in addons), they make your life so much nicer. I'm particularly thinking of let and destructuring, and I suspect parameter defaults and rest-arguments will be hugely popular as well. The few bigger features, especially modules and generators, are for addressing the most important gaps in JS.<p>Dave",1349805821

I started out at a web shop for 4 years, so I'd spend a lot of time in other peoples code.  I then moved on to a nice little SaaS company with a 10 year old code base which had a bunch of legacy code that I had to deal with when first starting out. I had to pick up a variety of languages that I had not used professionally before. I have spent 4 years there and am leaving at the end of this week to start my first company.<p>But my belief is the same, the solution to the problems described in the article is time/experience, not the adoption of some pessimistic mindset.  You will run into bugs when working in other peoples code, as a result you will learn not to make those mistakes.  Over time you will get quicker at identifying similar bugs and will be able to resolve them quicker each time as well.<p>The most common answer to any CS question that you are asked in college is ""It depends"".  So how do you resolve these nasty legacy code bugs?  Well, it depends.  Is this code reused a lot in other places?  Is this critical functionality to the user?  Once you determine how important the buggy code is, you can decide whether to solve it with a hack or a well thought out solution.<p>Don't sweat the bugs, don't become a Debby Downer, fix them as they rise, and keep building cool shit.",1349805642

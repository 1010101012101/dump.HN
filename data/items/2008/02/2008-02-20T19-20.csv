I think the lesson they taught kids was terrible (it's better if everyone is the same), but I liked the <i>way they taught it</i> by challenging the kids to examine their own assumptions. The problem was merely that the kids were examining them based on flawed premises, as you stated.",1203537563

Clannishness, family preferences, primogeniture, cousin marriages, etc, are all necessary to maintain feudalism, not capitalism.<p>If you really hate capitalism, go straight to the real alternative: Command economy. This is where some brain dead bureaucrat decides who gets wealth based upon adherance to political orthodoxy--which is essentially what the teachers did in the end. Works great with fixed resources like toys. Doesn't work so great when the fields need tilling.<p>[1] EDIT: Should be several higher. They only wrote ""WalMart inheritence"" once.",1203537410

From the UK, he got a student in the US to develop security software for 600 pounds. He installed it on two servers which cost 1000 pounds each. He sold the system to an existing client for 8000 pounds. The student required supervision but it allowed my friend to do on-site consulting while the outsourced software was being developed. The difference in timezone wasn't an issue. Indeed, if you're already working full time then outsourcing to a different timezone can be very beneficial.<p>However, there isn't much opportunity for a start-up to outsource development. Cost isn't a issue. You should be working in a small field, within your competence. There's also transaction cost which places a minimum size on the project to be outsourced. For a start-up, most projects will be too small to outsource.<p>If you're thinking of outsourcing a project, think whether you should do it at all.",1203535996

119908,comment,119760,119760,0,0,iamwil,,,"This article surprised me.  I thought it was going to be some news piece about how some school banned legos, like how some middle school banned dances.<p>Instead, it was an exploration on social and power dynamics between people through legos.<p>I have to admit, as someone can see how the invisible hand works, I also reacted when I read that the teachers thought a capitalist society was unjust.  But in their classroom, the situation arose because the amount of wealth, ""cool lego pieces"" were fixed, thus giving a zero-sum game.  In the real economy, wealth is not fixed because peoples' needs expand, and is not a zero-sum game overall.  I'd like to see the same experiment if kids could create their own types of pieces.  I suspect the same power imbalance will arise where some kids can make cooler pieces than others, but that doesn't mean it can't change as some kids can get better over time.<p>So they brought back the legos, and I was thinking that they might end up with more communistic/socialistic rules due to the teachers, but then at the end the kids made up their own rules, and the article listed some of the rules that the kids came up with:<p><pre><code>  * All structures are public structures. Everyone can use all the Lego structures. But only the 
    builder or people who have her or his permission are allowed to change a structure.
  * Lego people can be saved only by a ""team"" of kids, not by individuals.
  * All structures will be standard sizes.
</code></pre>
To me, it sounds remarkably like open source software.  Translated, it's stuff we hear in OSS all the time:<p><pre><code>  * Anyone can contribute patches, but only the maintainer and his trusted developers can commit the changes
  * (a bit of a stretch here, but) All bugs are shallow with enough eyeballs
  * Adhere to coding conventions you see in the code.  2 spaces for tabs, not 4.</code></pre>",1203535511

119901,comment,119760,119828,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"The fundamental problem with their Lego trading game (and the original Legotown) is that they assume capitalism involves a fixed amount of resources that can only be traded. In reality, the resources are constantly growing. If it was really a fixed-resource system, it would always end like Monopoly, with one person owning everything, or owning enough to always be in power at the least.<p>All it takes is a second to stop and realize that wealth is <i>created</i>, not <i>taken</i>. If it was all really <i>taken</i>, then where in the heck did we take it from? (I mean we as in the whole world.) The world is immensely more wealthy than it was a thousand years ago, and all that wealth was created by the hard work of all those generations. Surely all the wealth creation done by startups is evidence of that.<p>I think this is generally an economic misunderstanding that a lot of people have. To them, it's ""Every dollar Bill Gates has is a dollar less for everyone else, so that is unfair."" In fact, PG made this argument much better than I can, here: <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a><p>That said, I did really enjoy how these teachers approached the art of teaching children.

119900,comment,119760,119870,0,0,Afton,,,"Actually, I agree with you. I assume that you are reading into my comment some enormous weight of dialog that I wasn't a part of. I'm unsure about how to respond since I feel like we're talking at cross purposes. So with the fair warning that we may simply continue to misunderstand each other, here goes:<p>Of course you can 'get there'. But that doesn't make it 'fair'. If someone has to work for 0 hours for 100% chance of success and I have to work for 2000 hours for 0.01%, that isn't just. Horatio Alger stories are, frankly, rare and far between.<p>The basic problem is that the outlook that a person should take on life is that they are the master of their own destiny and that they can make it on the strength of their own power. When I say ""should"" I just mean, that is the viewpoint of the world that makes them have the best chance of achieving success. It's a psychological trick that gives people courage, and helps them to recognize opportunities. That's a very short form of what I meant when I said that there was another lesson that the teachers missed out on.<p>What is frustrating to me is that people take an outlook (""I am the master of my own destiny"") and apply it to the world as though it were _true_. So it is common to hear people look down on the poor by saying variants of ""if only they weren't so lazy they could make something of themselves"". This ignores the <i>fact</i> that different people have different oportunities and that those oportunities are not of their own making.<p>In any case, have a good day.",1203534970

It seems like a cool program.<p>That said, the ultimate lesson they implanted in these kids is flawed.<p>I'm sure they'd be thrilled if these kids ultimately grow up and demand society be like the utopia they constructed in their after-school program. But the whole thing stems on there being a finite amount of resources. In the classroom, sure, there is a bucket of bricks – and that's all there is. But in the real world wealth isn't a finite resource.†<p>The brick game is based on this flawed thinking: According to the game, different colored bricks are worth different amounts, and the luck of your initial draw determines how you rank. The kids are told they can trade (I guess to make it seem more like capitalism?), but that's stupid because there's nothing to gain by trading – who's gonna accept a 2pt brick for a 3pt one?<p>So the kids are supposed to take away that wealth gets randomly, <i>unfairly</i> distributed, and the only way to make things right is to <i>force</i> the undeserving to share their bricks.<p>But in real life you aren't stuck trying to trade your money for money: you can attempt to trade wealth – wealth you can create. So a kid could offer back scratches for 1pt bricks. Or agree to carry all of Liam's green bricks for a couple interest bricks. Suddenly you're not limited by your initial draw.<p>And I think that's a very important lesson that these kids didn't get.<p>The article says these kids are upper-middle class, so it may not matter as much, but imagine that these were poor kids. Here they've been taught that they can only reach a certain random level of success, and to get any higher will require resources be taken from some undeserving, rich bastard – which, hey, some politician will make happen once in a while – but otherwise your efforts to succeed are futile.<p>What a hopeless lesson.<p>† <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a>",1203534620

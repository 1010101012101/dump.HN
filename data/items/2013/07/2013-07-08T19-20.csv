There&#x27;s the status conferred by being <i>far</i> wealthier than typical for the area. There&#x27;s also the status conferred by having a respected/liked job.<p>In Seattle/SF your wealth status is high, but your interestingness status is low. Dirt low even.<p>In NYC your wealth status is middling, but your interestingness status is relatively high. I prefer this setup far, far more.<p>But I&#x27;m also not a sociologist - maybe we&#x27;re defining status differently.",1373313585

Scaling out is preferred because your architecture is mode modular and you do not have to constantly buy bigger machines as your usage grows; you just add additional machines with similar capacity.  The main problem with scaling up is that price and performance are not linearly related and eventually you will be limited by the performance available to one system.

The results are also instantaneous.

If I can bind Windows-C / Windows-V to copy/paste in a terminal emulator I&#x27;d be happier.<p>Select-to-copy is yuck for two reasons:
1: After you select, it copies and then deselects. This is annoying if you want to see that you selected the right thing, and it doesn&#x27;t allow you to change your selection if you see you were off by a character.
2: I like to select to mark my place sometimes, but I don&#x27;t want that to change what&#x27;s on my system clipboard.<p>ctrl/shift Insert is yuck because it&#x27;s a two-hand keystroke and doesn&#x27;t have an easy way to remember whether shift or ctrl is the copy.

I try to code a little something, a little game, google some documentation, write some snippets, ducttape them together and see the whole thing self-destruct with obscure exceptions. Googling those errors doesn&#x27;t bear fruit often.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m aware of all the trial and error involved in programming, but I noticed that frustration comes back when I tackle any kind of creative endeavour (I&#x27;m currently trying to learn how to draw) and even when playing video games (roguelikes and shoot them up games).<p>I would also like to feel that thrill when solving problems on your own, making &quot;air castles&quot; from scratch.<p>How can I get over that frustration? How can I acquire the persistence necessary to undertake any project and see it through to completion?<p>I know that there is some kind of &quot;playfulness&quot; involved in it, but I can&#x27;t put a finger on it....<p>Thank you for your time.",1373313141

I can back that up, but I think most people buy this already.<p>However, real estate demand is <i>extremely</i> inelastic.

If you go the big-iron route, you buy another 2 $5,000,000 servers, because server price does not increase linearly with performance.  If you&#x27;re a big site, server vendors know they can charge you through the nose for it, because there are comparatively few hardware vendors that know what they&#x27;re doing once you get up to that level of performance.<p>Look, if you&#x27;re going to make the case that one should buy bigger servers instead of more servers, then this becomes an economic argument.  The reason large web-scale companies don&#x27;t do this is because it outsources one of their core competencies.  When they scale horizontally across thousands of commodity machines, then knowledge of their problem domain becomes encoded in the scaling decisions they make and stays internal to the company.  When they scale vertically by buying bigger hardware, then they are trading profits in exchange for having someone else worry about the difficulties of building really big, fast supercomputers.  It makes life a lot easier for the engineers, but it destroys the company&#x27;s bargaining position in the marketplace.  Instead of having a proprietary competitive advantage, they are now the commodity application provider on top of somebody else&#x27;s proprietary competitive advantage.  If someone wants to compete with them, they buy the same big iron and write a Twitter clone, while if their server vendor wants to raise prices, it has them by the balls since the whole business is built on their architecture.<p>(I have a strong suspicion that Twitter would not be economically viable on big iron, anyway.  They would end up in a situation similar to Pandora, where their existence is predicated on paying large rents to the people whose IP they use to build their business, and yet the advertising revenue coming in is not adequate to satisfy either the business or their suppliers.)",1373311380

But you also have to consider that a user may develop a false sense of security if they&#x27;re told their data is &quot;encrypted.&quot; This does put the user at risk. So if you&#x27;re going to use JS crypto--which is almost certainly unsound--you take the risk of misleading users in a potentially dangerous way.<p>To give a concrete example, let&#x27;s say Google adds JS-based PGP support to Gmail. Suppose that, in general, it works. Inasmuch as Gmail delivers properly encoded PGP messages to your recipients, and it can read PGP messages that are sent to you. But suppose further that Google is somehow compromised. Maybe through technical means, maybe through social engineering, maybe through legal pressure. And then a malicious JS payload is delivered to users, hidden somewhere deep in the page. This payload allows PGP messages to continue being sent and received. But it also backdoors you. Maybe by creating an alternate version of every message encrypted with the attacker&#x27;s key.<p>Unfortunately, current clients are not at all equipped to detect if this is happening. For the browser to be able to participate in a truly secure crypto system, it would need to have the most critical parts <i>built in,</i> not provided by websites as JS.<p>> Is using https enough?<p>It&#x27;s generally believed to be adequate for protecting against a man in the middle. It doesn&#x27;t help you if your computer or the server is compromised. Whether you trust Google or not is your choice. The way I see it, every entity that stores data will eventually have abuse, a leak, or a breach. So if you&#x27;re at peace with that risk, then HTTPS is enough.",1373311032

Imagine how much more we could be doing if programmers were not spending hours trying to figure out where a dangling pointer was created.<p>Really, the popularity of C, C++, and related languages has little to do with the languages themselves.  C became popular because of Unix, not because of its technical features, and Unix became popular because of its licensing.  C++ became popular because of Windows, not because of its technical features; Windows became popular because of the Unix Wars and because of MS Office.  If Unix had been written in Lisp or ML, we would be talking about how popular Lisp or ML are.  For what it&#x27;s worth, entire operating systems were written in Lisp at one time; their failure had nothing to do with their technical merits and everything to do with terrible marketing and bad predictions.<p>If you want to talk about how fantastic C or C++ is, try pointing to an overwhelming success story that could not have happened without the language.  Altran Praxis has the lowest bug rate in the industry; they credit the SPARK programming language, which is well-suited to the formal verification techniques they rely on.  The military planning system DART paid both its own development costs and several decades of research that led up to it; it was thrown together in a few weeks using Lisp.  I have yet to hear that kind of success story from C++ programmers; the only thing I ever seem to hear about are squeezing a few extra clock cycles out.<p>If this were a popularity contest, we would still be hand-rolling assembly language.  The same reasons that led programmers to use compiled languages apply to switching away from low-level languages like C and C++.  Sure, people are still writing assembly language, but it is a niche.  That is where C and C++ should be:  a niche, mostly just for maintaining legacy code that is too expensive to rewrite in a better language.",1373310857

That said, having a mortgage lower than your rent is true for many people who bought at &quot;the right time&quot; rather than at the peak of demand. Demand is outstripping supply due to the insane people who get elected to the city government, which is largely driven by fresh but naive stream of tech workers and the radicalized longterm residents. The only way to fix this is to oust people who do not support fiscal security and personal freedoms (Leeland Yee is at the top of my list) and replace them with people who eschew cronyism and support a balanced approach (Sean Elsbernd comes to mind).<p>The so called BART divide is really more about greed and institutionalized mediocracy. Station agents should make minimum wage, the people who make BART actually run are the maintenance staff and the conductors. The conductors shouldn&#x27;t be people in trains, they should be people in offices as the technology for having fully automated trains has existed for decades. The safety issue is a red herring, as the issue as posed is not for more transit police, but for more lighting. Management is also not blameless as they should be putting less money towards bureaucratic salaries and returning it to the ridership in the form of lower fares and upgrades to cars.<p>If you feel guilt about living and working in SF, stop it.

Let&#x27;s say that during peak rush hour, N people + M packages need to be transported. That means that in order to satisfy peak demand efficiently, we need N+M cars <i>and</i> road capacity. During off-peak hours, lets say that only 20% of the population needs to travel. That means you&#x27;ve got the other 80% of the cars sitting around doing nothing just like they are today. If the average distance to nearby parking is say 2 miles, then we have 80% of the cars just driving empty 2 extra miles to prevent themselves from taking up road capacity (while today we trade off by creating parking lots).<p>Despite that, I do think there will be some improvement in terms of car use. Namely:<p>* the average car size will shrink to probably that of a smart car (2 seats, little cargo room)
* parking lots will shrink (but not disappear) due to effective stacked parking
* vehicle efficiency will increase (human drivers are inherently bad at maintaining fuel/energy efficiency with acceleration/deceleration)<p>The danger is that this once again will make car use &quot;cheap&quot; and like the article suggests, extends sprawl yet again.

6008524,comment,6007899,6007899,3,0,brianchu,,,"It&#x27;s really hard to answer this question when Backbone is lumped together with Angular and Ember. What Backbone offers is a light layer of structure over your code. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t give you much, but I believe its sole purpose is to avoid the jQuery spaghetti that forms once you start writing more than 100-200 lines of JavaScript. Backbone doesn&#x27;t give you many opinions, but I personally agree with you in that Backbone gives you a few opinions (not many), but not enough meat to justify those few opinions. It&#x27;s basically a guideline as to how to structure different components of your app and how to communicate and share data between components. That being said, as far as I&#x27;m aware, you can more or less do anything you want to the DOM in Backbone Views. And Backbone certainly does offer some features: routing, an event system, and a data syncing system.<p>Backbone is probably several times less restrictive and controlling than something like, say, Ember or Angular. I&#x27;ve only used Angular, so let me comment on that. I think Angular definitely offers some powerful features that justify its structure. Two-way data binding, a system for reusable components (directives), a structure for organizing animations, a system for managing data from RESTful APIs, a full testing scaffold/system, etc. <i>It&#x27;s not uncommon for jQuery and even Backbone apps that are rewritten in Angular to cut their codebase >2x.</i><p>I&#x27;ve heard that Ember is even more restrictive/opinionated than Angular, and perhaps it is more powerful as a result - I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve been satisfied with Angular.<p>That being said, there are tradeoffs for using frameworks. For example, you should only do DOM manipulation inside Angular directives. Honestly I think this is a positive, due to various powerful structural features of directives (reusability, modularity, customizability), but for some this can be a negative.<p>Moreover, because these frameworks are just contained in JavaScript files, you can selectively apply these frameworks, where necessary, to different parts of your web sites.<p>Ultimately, I think frameworks like Angular or Ember <i>are</i> as restrictive <i>and</i> as powerful as frameworks like Rails and Django. Backbone would be like Flask or Sinatra.",1373310269

If I&#x27;m your ISP, then I can read who you&#x27;re sending it too right off of your packets, and if that information&#x27;s not there, then I can&#x27;t send the packets on - the message doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.<p>You can, perhaps, obfuscate it with onion routing - provided a significant percentage of the network hasn&#x27;t been compromised - but ....

Arguably, there are too many jobs available there which is causing at least some of the cost of living pressure.  These jobs are unlikely to vanish en masse like they did in Detroit (at least not any time soon), so even if a bunch of tech people leave SF, many will stay and it&#x27;ll just move the city towards a natural equilibrium.",1373310107

6008493,comment,6002595,6004317,1,0,onetimeonly,,,"Well, I just disagree. My experience is that recovering your bank account after fraud is trivial. Fixing fraudulently obtained credit takes longer, but basically just involves going through a formal process with credit reference agencies and lenders. If you want to protect against this, you can get a credit record protection service from any of the major credit agencies, where they alert you if there is any activity on your credit record s you can fix it.<p>edit: nobody should be so unaware of their own credit record that they lose a house sale because of undiscovered fraud. Keeping on top of it is very cheap and as simple as registering on a website (UK example: <a href=""https://www.creditexpert.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.creditexpert.co.uk</a>)",1373310033

6008489,comment,6008248,6008248,77,0,api,,,"I&#x27;ve got a possibly great job offer on the table from SF/SV, but may turn it down. I&#x27;d love the city I&#x27;m sure, but after glancing around I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that home ownership is <i>unthinkable</i> to anyone who hasn&#x27;t had a cash-out event. The real estate market is certifiably, utterly bat-dookie insane.<p>NYC is often considered more expensive, and <i>Manhattan</i> is certainly... well... Manhattan. But taken collectively the NYC metro area is actually much more affordable. You <i>can</i> find places to live that are nice, friendly to someone older than 25-30, and at least sanely priced. They might not be in the closest or most fashionable neighborhoods, but they&#x27;ll be reachable by NYC&#x27;s excellent transit system.<p>In SF you have nowhere good to go unless you want an absurd commute, and its transit is horrible compared to NYC. So you&#x27;re either rich or you&#x27;re in a crummy apartment or with roommates. That doesn&#x27;t work for people who aren&#x27;t kids in their 20s.<p>My suspicion is that it&#x27;s part policy choice -- a lot of protectionism from existing property owners who want to keep riding the property bubble and a lot of NIMBYism -- and part irresponsibility on the part of homebuyers. I suspect that many homebuyers in SF are doing the irresponsible thing of <i>squeezing into a home</i> by spending upwards of 40%, even 50+% of their income on mortgage payments instead of the usually fiscally responsible number of ~30%. And this is punishing everyone and sucking the soul from the city.<p>In the long term, Silicon Valley and SF is eating its young. It&#x27;s a city built on young entrepreneurs coming there and doing new stuff, but if nobody who hasn&#x27;t already <i>made it</i> can afford to live there what happens then? The other problem is that these high costs soak up everyone&#x27;s spare time and money, leaving them with the requirement to work like crazy for other people to afford to live instead of on their own innovative projects. It sucks away the marginal &quot;play time&quot; when innovation really happens.<p>If this isn&#x27;t remedied, SF/SV will become an echo chamber of already-made-its and already-know-it-alls. Then it will stagnate and be left behind.<p>Edit: real estate hyperinflation in general is a social ill that deserves to be tackled directly as such. It seems as if real estate has mutated into this hungry sponge that sucks up all surplus economic vitality from any region that experiences success. Imagine what all that money in SV could be doing if it weren&#x27;t all sucked up by real estate.<p>It&#x27;s like beyond a certain point, people no longer get wealthier. Their houses do. The home -- the &quot;American dream&quot; -- has become a tool of indentured servitude and bank fiefdom.",1373310006

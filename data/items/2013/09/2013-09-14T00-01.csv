These two, plus the minimum amount of Javascript code necessary to deliver a rich experience.<p>Nowadays, there&#x27;s a lot that can be done with modern CSS that in the past required Javascript code -- from dynamic menus to 3d effects to responsive web design.

More than 4 people is too much, and you really need to trust and respect the other folks you live with.<p>You also need to be able to not sweat the little things--having people ask if they need to pick up an extra X when they go to the grocery store is handy. Living close to a grocery store (within walking distance) is even handier.<p>Also, you need to not be messy party folks--your landlord is much more likely to give you an easy time if they don&#x27;t see evidence of this.

6384125,comment,6381385,6381385,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"Reminds me of the first Project I did with my Pi (last year) except I was using Squid and two Ethernet Ports (Apple&#x27;s USB to Ethernet Adapter is basically plug and play with Linux). I eventually did a Wifi version, very similar to this article. I then developed a basic Web based UI that allowed you to turn it On and Off by clicking a button. The next step was to use the GPIO Pins to hook up a physical switch that you could press to turn it on/off, but never went that far. For a while there I thought about packaging it as a Product and trying a campaign on Kickstarter, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of just repackaging someone elses Hardware and Code and selling it as my own. Eventually someone else did their own version (AdTrap) and was mildly successful. These days I&#x27;m still working on Pi projects as a side hobby, got 2 Projects I&#x27;m working on right now. Ironically, one of them supports the Advertising Industry (but not in the way one might think), and the other has to do with Content Delivery. The only real challenge I have (and it&#x27;s a big one) is taking the next step and building something for mass production. Since the Pi is pre-made, I view it as a great platform to build a prototype, but not necessarily a good platform for mass distribution of a product (from a business perspective, production cost too high). For anyone else into it, check out the new GPS chip&#x27;s they&#x27;re selling. Awesome possibilities!<p>Regarding Ad&#x27;s and Blocking Ad&#x27;s, I have no remorse building something that gives the consumer a choice to blocks Ad&#x27;s. While I do agree that Ad&#x27;s can be a viable and acceptable business model, it is my personal opinion that the Advertising Industry has been abusing consumers for decades. And I find this detrimental to the Industry as a whole. I think it&#x27;s about time that the consumers had a choice. I find the average (aka normal) user experience of your typical Ad (in any format) to be horrible; The Ad is basically forced on you. I also find that the Advertising Industry has little regard for the consumer&#x27;s Privacy, which I do not find acceptable (as a consumer). I do think that there are innovative ways to Advertise and create a positive experience, but I dont think the industry (as a whole) has realized/embraced them yet. It seems to me that the Advertising Industry is stuck on a model developed in the 60&#x27;s, and has continued to push this old model even while technology evolves. I think it&#x27;s time for the Advertising Industry to evolve. Hopefully I can test/validate this with one of my next Pi based Projects.",1379119015

    sin( + ) = sin() cos() + cos() sin()
</code></pre>
You can just set  =  and get:<p><pre><code>    cos(2 ) = cos^2() - sin^2()
    sin(2 ) = 2 cos() sin()
</code></pre>
If you don&#x27;t remember the angle-addition formulas, but you remember that multiplying two complex numbers means adding their angles (arguments) and multiplying their lengths (moduli), you can just pick two unit-modulus complex numbers w = cos() + i sin() = a + bi, and z = cos() + i sin() = c + di.  Multiplying them gives some complex number wz = u + vi, but because these are unit vectors, it must be the case that u = cos( + ) and v = sin( + ).  So<p><pre><code>    u + vi = wz
           = (a + bi) (c + di)
           = ac + (bc + ad)i + bdi^2
           = (ac - bd) + (bc + ad)i
</code></pre>
Then equating real and imaginary parts, you get<p><pre><code>    u = ac - bd
    v = bc + ad
</code></pre>
If you substitute the trig expressions for the variables it becomes<p><pre><code>    cos( + ) = cos() cos() - sin() sin()
    sin( + ) = sin() cos() + cos() sin()

I&#x27;ve been poor, but if push came to shove, I always had a middle-class mother I could move back to. That&#x27;s a &#x27;safety net&#x27; that many in poverty simply do not have.<p>And so it annoys the shit out of me that when a friend in finance got a $10k raise, all she could talk about was &quot;but I lose half of it to the government!&quot;. In some strange world where 30% equals half, she&#x27;s more concerned about what she lost than the fact that her gain was almost equal to a poor person&#x27;s annual income. She couldn&#x27;t even frame her payrise as a positive.<p>I was discussing poverty with a colleague yesterday, as we were discussing the concept of Basic Income. I mentioned that when I was on welfare, it still wasn&#x27;t quite enough to keep me fed and housed. His response was &quot;then move house to where it&#x27;s cheaper&quot;. My counter was &quot;firstly, the point of &#x27;social security&#x27; is to keep people socially secure, at least for short stints, which means not kicking them out of their homes for a handful of dollars&quot;. Secondly, of course, was the ignorance of the fact that moving house is expensive (fiscally and socially), from the hunt, to the security deposit, to the day of shifting furniture, to having utilities hooked up. Thirdly, if the point was to give me welfare in the short term until I get a job, moving house to where it&#x27;s cheaper is going to make it harder to get a job.<p>Discussing poverty is difficult, because unless you&#x27;ve been close to it, you won&#x27;t understand the limitations of being in it.

I pop a server in, attaches power and ethernet, checks that the IPMI is reachable and that it sees the PXE server, and beyond that &quot;managing the hardware&quot; comes to yanking the occasional dead harddrive and inserting a new one, and ever now and again to confirm a server is dead.<p>Meanwhile with EC2 I see most of the same non-hardware issues (e.g. kernel panic, applications occasionally spinning out of control and taking a server down) that are just as trivial to handle via IPMI as via the EC2 console, but we also have to engineer around things like the lack of solid, stable, directly attached RAID arrays, which we don&#x27;t need to worry about with the bare metal servers.<p>And no, EBS does not count - the number of times volumes have gotten stuck in attached state on a failed instance terrifies me. It also can&#x27;t in any way match directly attached SSD RAID setups for performance which is another reason why it ends up taking more ops time: You end up with setups that simply take more vms to compensate for platform limitations.<p>I absolutely think EC2 is great for things like large batch jobs etc. where your requirements vary wildly, but most people don&#x27;t even have enough daily variance for that to get anywhere near compensating for the cost of EC2 (and nothing stops you from deploying hybrid approaches - in fact I&#x27;m working on hybrid approaches mixing bare metal servers with EC2 to handle batch jobs and load spikes now)",1448362454

My guess (having looked at a lot of things I&#x27;m curious about fro above) is that it&#x27;s a vanishingly small amount of extra information for significant learning curve and a not insignificant chance of discovery while launching/landing/flying the drone.<p>As to regulation? Hard question to answer, but I find it hard to believe treating everything from 1/2 a pound up to 55 pounds the same makes any sense - consider what two orders of magnitude in weight means for motor vehicles. 300lb worth of motorcycle is treated differently to 3000lb worth of car, and very differently again to 30,000lb worth of truck (or 30lb worth of bicycle).<p>I think there&#x27;s an important difference between non-commercial and commercial use of drones - I know when I&#x27;m flying for fun, there are conditions and circumstances in which I choose not to fly, where it&#x27;d be way to easy to accept additional risk as an aerial photographer if it meant getting &quot;the shot&quot; and thereby earning the money.<p>I justify to myself that my small quads weigh less than a football, and I&#x27;ve got control over them so I&#x27;m significantly less likely to hit somebody accidentally. I&#x27;ve intentionally flown my quads into myself to see just how much it&#x27;d hurt, and while I&#x27;m comfortable saying &quot;I wasn&#x27;t injured&quot; I&#x27;m 100% certain that the mother of a small child wouldn&#x27;t see things the same way. It kinda hurts, but at least with the plastic props it doesn&#x27;t break the skin. (I wouldn&#x27;t do that with the carbon fibre props on, I&#x27;m too chicken for that...)<p>If _I_ were making the rules, I&#x27;d probably ignore anything under ~500g or 1lb, they&#x27;re no more dangerous that a skateboard in my opinion, and far less likely to be used by creeps/crooks/terrorists than a cellphone camera. From maybe 500g up to somewhere around 2 or 3kg should be considered fundamentally different, but still in the category of &quot;potentially dangerous toy if misused&quot; - perhaps treated similarly to a gocart or a dirtbike - if you want to own and use one away from people, no problem, but if you want to ride your dirtbike around town it&#x27;s gonna need lights/rego/insurance. Once you get up towards 5g or more, you&#x27;re getting up to where I&#x27;d also like to see operators to have demonstrated some basic training/understanding of the risks and an acknowledgement that they understand and accept responsibility for them - I&#x27;m thinking along the lines of ham radio operators license here - you&#x27;d need to read some theory, sit an exam, but mostly you&#x27;d lose the &quot;I didn&#x27;t know it was dangerous&quot; excuse.<p>That&#x27;s almost certainly not &quot;good enough&quot; to work out properly in a lawyer-happy no-universal-healthcare society though. Which is sad (both for US based drone hobbyists, as well as those of us from elsewhere who&#x27;s local laws are very likely to be heavily based on US laws...)<p>(Note: from a non US point of view, I find it astounding that &quot;drones need regulating&quot;, but it&#x27;s a fundamental human right to buy an assault rifle at a gun show with no paperwork. The perspective and risks and responses seem all way out of whack from half a planet away. Not saying &quot;all guns are bad&quot;, but surely &quot;very few drones are as dangerous as an AR47&quot; is unambiguously true...)",1448361434

In practice, few doubt that it was the muslim way : convert, slavery or die.<p>Since muslims force people to convert, and have the death penalty for conversion out of islam, it seems extremely hypocritical to criticize the imposition of foreign culture. What is your argument against it ? It&#x27;s not nice when others do it ?",1448359853

10619989,comment,10612516,10618617,0,0,Matthias247,,,"That the default posix socket API is in blocking mode by default was a decision that was made lots of years ago and for some specific reasons. If the reasons at that time might have been different, then it could now also be async by default. So I don&#x27;t think that tells us whether one or the other model is the more natural or a better one.<p>Look at the LWIP library for embedded for example. There the async API is the default one, and you have to take the extra mile (and some performance hit) to get the blocking behavior. The midori OS prototype also seems to have implemented a pure async IO subsystem.<p>I also think it depends on the use-case whether one or the other model is more appealing, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s only for performance reasons. A lot of people here think about IO mainly in terms of http request processing because web services are the usual domain here. For this such applications I think blocking abstractions come quite naturally, because you there you read the input stream once, then do a sequence of intermediate processing steps and then write a response. If you instead are working on other domains (writing a message broker, a gateway application, http/2 library, realtime sensordata processing system, ...) where there is no linear sequence of read/write operations and where you have shared state between your IO endpoints then your needs and the preferred building blocks might be different.",1448359589

7157237,comment,7156511,7156936,3,0,lettergram,,,"My point had nothing to do with wealth gaps...<p>My point was that people want power any way they can get it, with a capitalist system it&#x27;s much more about hard work than who you know, your name, your status essentially. Other systems simply trade one out for the other, as in, e.g. mostly who you know and less about how hard you work.<p>I am not arguing about wealth, I am arguing about hope, happiness, and fairness. If I work harder and receive more there is a form of symmetry work = money = food, shelter, happiness. On the other hand if work doesn&#x27;t mean I receive more or I receive very little for my increased work, it changes the equation. The latter system supports not working that hard because that benefits you more than working hard.<p>Now, discussing directly the wealth gap, wealth is a sign of how hard you work, how intelligent you are, and in corrupt systems how many people you know. Thankfully, in a capitalist system since work translates into wealth you can often MINIMIZE the corruption, or at the very least its better than a system where a committee/laws redistributes wealth. My point there being, a fair distribution of wealth should be based off market pressures because it is more likely to be a fair distribution, sure that means some people lose, but those people are the ones who don&#x27;t want to work, don&#x27;t have the intelligence to make money and don&#x27;t have friends to support them. In that case, they are free to join a church or local community center, which are also supported in capitalist nations.<p>All that being said, I don&#x27;t actually feel that my claims are &quot;bullshit,&quot; perhaps I misrepresented them, but there is evidence to support my argument...

There is a lot of crap in all journals, it&#x27;s often needlessly technical for practical purposes or too bleeding edge to actually be useful yet.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be snarky, but honestly unless you know what you&#x27;re looking for it&#x27;s a fool&#x27;s game.  Once you&#x27;ve got the feel for a subject, you tend to find several authors that crop up time and time again, or landmark papers that really shifted the field.  But that takes a long time, it takes most PhD students a year to fully understand and simply collate the background of a topic they may think they know a lot about.<p>That and no one <i>actually</i> reads journals.  You do a search on Web of Knowledge or ADS or arXiv or whatever your poison and you see what comes up.  Point is, you need to know what you&#x27;re looking for.<p>This is akin to saying that if you read Phys Rev enough, you&#x27;ll become a physicist.  Sure, sure, keep up with the trends, but big important results get press which is enough to rely on to start off with.<p>To become a data scientist?  Read the recommended textbooks and take a proper degree in statistics, computer or data science.  Look at the courses on EdX and Coursera for a starting point, they&#x27;ll help you decide whether this is something you seriously want to pursue.<p>Even if this is just a hobby, e.g. you&#x27;re a coder that wants to branch out, you should still take the time to invest in education properly.  Data science, like statistics in general, is very easy to mess up.  When people draw bad conclusions from data (and good data scientists can make up any conclusion from any data set), bad things inevitably happen.  Entire threads of science have been destroyed because somewhere, someone messed up their stats and apparently important results are meaningless.",1391183159

They cannot lie to the government, or keep their embarrassing, blackmailworthy secrets from it.<p>And one of these people has the <i>unmitigated gall</i> to take evidence of unethical government activities which had been <i>clearly</i> classified as SECRET and TOP SECRET and just <i>release it</i> to the American public, along with the rest of the world.<p>Clearly, if the clearance process worked as intended, every single person authorized to see this stuff should feel a tiny bit queasy after reading it.  The problem is that people who try to escalate within the system are denied promotion, are not awarded the contract when it is up for re-compete, or they are simply fired outright and blacklisted from further work.  And then nothing else changes.  Clearly, if your choice is between losing your livelihood and making no impact whatsoever and losing your livelihood and maybe also your freedom, and possibly changing things for the better, you might take that additional risk.<p>America, if you don&#x27;t want your specialist personnel, specifically chosen for high ethical standards, to spill secrets, maybe, just maybe, you should arrange your affairs such that speaking truth to power isn&#x27;t the stupidest thing someone could possibly do.

On the flip side, I think it&#x27;s bad as an enforced policy from above. I&#x27;ve worked with some managers who have a &quot;Don&#x27;t come to me with problems, come to me with solutions&quot; rule. I think that&#x27;s poor management for at least three reasons:<p>1. This kind of thing leads to bigger problems. If they&#x27;re small but your employee is having trouble coming up with a solution, and they don&#x27;t come to you, odds are the problem will get worse and you might not find out about it before it takes the proverbial &quot;pound of cure&quot; to deal with it.<p>2. If your employee already <i>has</i> a solution in mind, why do they need to come to you at all? Just let them implement it. If you need your employees to run their &quot;solutions&quot; by you, you might be a micromanager. As a manager, I <i>want</i> my employees coming to me with their unsolvable problems, not the stuff they think they can handle. Sure, there&#x27;s some risk of a mistake from time to time, but I treat those as experiences to learn from and there are other ways of keeping those &quot;lessons&quot; from getting too expensive.<p>3. It&#x27;s often hypocritical. Does the average middle manager waste their senior exec&#x27;s time with stuff they already know the answer to? Most likely not.<p>All that said, a policy of &quot;Don&#x27;t come to me with a problem until after you&#x27;ve thought about it a little bit&quot; (i.e. a form of &quot;Don&#x27;t come to me with data, come to me with analysis&quot;) is perfectly reasonable to me.",1391182343

There are a lot of conventions being followed here and they are followed consistently throughout the code base - they become more and more obvious the more code you read. Not knowing about copy_{from,to}_user is a very rookie mistake. I find it hard to believe the author of this code didn&#x27;t know about it (they even annotated the parameter as a user pointer), my guess is they probably just figured that the functions they were calling already performed this check and didn&#x27;t think it needed to be inserted twice.<p>Edit: Re-reading your comment I also wanted to point out that the problem of handling user mode pointers in a kernel is a difficult one, and requires discipline. You can&#x27;t keep a straight face and say as you do that you can handle it in a way that newbies can come right in and write bug free code without learning these conventions. The only sane way is to create a workable set of conventions, apply them consistently, and do what you can to educate new contributors as they come along.

In many news outfits this is a signal that the output can be in a less formal tone/pass a different set of editorial hurdles.<p>2. A maxim in the American newspaper business has historically been to write to an 8th grade (12 and 13 year old) audience.  They have historically felt that the American newspaper buying audience is ignorant.<p>3. Ukrainian politics does not receive very much coverage from the mainstream news organizations in the United States.  For instance, cnn.com only has 1 story on their front page about the Ukraine and it is well below the fold.  Foxnews.com has 1 story but it is headlined with highly sensational text.<p>So in short, yes I suspect a large part of the United States news paper reading public could use a refresher on the Ukraine protests.<p>Curiously, in your country how much coverage do you receive of the politics of Texas?

I&#x27;ll try to expand on it, tho it&#x27;s hard to do this briefly.<p>People reason (and discuss) in several modes, which are ordinarily mixed freely.  Deductive, a.k.a. <i>logical</i> (in the proper sense) reasoning is one, and the fallacy-or-not analysis is strictly applicable.<p>Another mode is that of empirical science, which is basically <i>inductive</i>. You can&#x27;t prove <i>logically</i> that, for example, substance X causes condition C, but you can establish a good probability by isolating the case, ruling out other factors, showing that the relation is reliably reproducible, etc..<p>A third mode is <i>humanistic</i> or <i>intuitive</i>. It is an error to suppose that this is unreliable or categorically invalid. Say you have thefts at a workplace, and question employees, and most answer straightforwardly, but one is evasive, furtive, avoids eye contact, can&#x27;t explain simple events - despite the inapplicability of the logical or scientific modes, this is a <i>rational</i> basis for directing suspicion.<p>Errors of a meta variety enter when one mode is evaluated by the standards for another. E.g., this writer depicts &quot;slippery slope&quot; as a fallacy of <i>logic</i> by inserting &quot;inevitably&quot; in his interpretation of claims - attributing to the argument-maker the claim that A <i>inevitably</i> leads to B. But in fact &quot;slippery slope&quot; belongs to the third mode, and as such it can be valid - censors do tend to expand their categories, and the actual claim may be, not that the progression is inevitable, but instead that it&#x27;s unacceptable to go further in that direction - and on this kind of interpretataion there may be no fallacy at all.<p>It&#x27;s a good list of <i>logic</i> fallacies, but we just have ot make sure we don&#x27;t try to apply the refutations in the context of other modes of reasoning.",1391180962

It can ask the west, but the west gives back a list of conditions to be satisfied (human rights, economical, etc) that are incredibly hard for the governmnet to achieve given deeply rooted corruption on all levels.<p>There is another source for the money: Russia (which, despite some westerners&#x27; beliefs, is a very rich country). In return Russia&#x27;s demands are to make sure that the deeply rooted corruption on all levels works in Russia&#x27;s favour. That is <i>much</i> easier to achieve.<p>Hence the recent $15 billion loan from Putin, that officially appears to be unconditional.<p>Another point I&#x27;d like to make is that many people in the east (I come from one of the big industrial cities in the south-east), don&#x27;t just dislike Europe and like Russia.

As more people contribute to it, with code, money, or simply by using it, the entire user base benefits. WordPress is a great example. I remember the days when WordPress was kind of wonky, but as it rose in usage and attracted more developers (and more of us started getting paid to contribute to the theme/plugin repos or Core), it quickly became stronger and oh so much more stable. There are tons of paid (&quot;premium&quot;) plugins and themes out there now, and so many people paying for WP.com, but it&#x27;s by no means a &quot;pay for features&quot; platform.<p>With Django, paying Andrew Godwin to dedicate some of his time to integrate South into Core is definitely the kind of thing all of us will benefit from whether we contributed or not, as would runserver. At £2500 (his original goal) it&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re paying his salary. Even with the $30,000 he raised, it&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s living high on the hog ℅ the django community. If someone wants to field a kickstarter for £2500 to improve runserver and people want it as badly as people wanted South integrated, it&#x27;d probably be successful. That kind of voluntary patronage hardly makes it a pay-for-features platform.",1391180540

Every proprietary Unix has appropriated large portions of BSD and, with few notable exceptions, none gave improvements back - or freely added original work to the common code pool because their competitors could take it and run - take whatever you gave them and compete against you with it.<p>GPL-like ""viral"" licenses negate the threat by ensuring any code you contribute cannot be used as a competitive advantage against you.<p>If it weren't for RMS and the invention of GPL-like licenses, I seriously doubt we would have a healthy open-source ecosystem.",1277924389

It's like, oh I can do this with this, or maybe I can make this with this and so on. I know it's not practical to chase down every path, but it definitely helps me to implement some of them.

The banks threw lending standards out the window because they had so much cash to lend.  When the central bank raised interest rates, the bottom fell out.<p>Here's the important part, though.  Because of the cozy relationships between banks and big industrial firms, the banks reacted by making _more_ bad loans to prop up failing firms.  Plus, the government raised consumption taxes which fell disproportionately on the lower classes.  The tied-up capital combined with the rising taxes on the people who spend the highest percentage of their income hurt a lot more than government spending on infrastructure.<p>Here's my worry about the U.S.:<p>1.

This (1) would cost a lot of money,  and (2) not raise my income (though it might get me a better benefits package),  would (3) qualify me for a job I don't want to do,  and (4) [most importantly] steal time from hacking on things that might have an impact on education.<p>Another half of it is that,  from a systemantic viewpoint (what does the system do vs. what does the system say that it does?) the real thing that ""the public"" wants from education is a way to pass (i) values and (ii) social status onto their children.  Overall,  the purpose of the system is to sort people out in social status by something that corresponds somewhat to ability [broadly defined] but as much to the social status of the parents...  and to do so in a way that people perceive that ""I failed"" rather than ""I was failed.""  As Habermas says,  this creates a feeling that the 'system' is legitimate which can somewhat compensate for the irrational and erroneous decisions that are made by governments and corporations.<p>(Questions of legitimacy don't come up so much when governments & corporations are successful at managing the economy,  since people are busy working and spending...)<p>The other major stakeholders are all self-interested,  and they've got pretty good rackets going.

To address this problem, we present Apiary, a system that transparently contains application faults while retaining the usage metaphors of a traditional desktop environment.  Apiary accomplishes this with three key mechanisms. It isolates applications in containers that integrate in a controlled manner at the display and file system. It introduces ephemeral containers that are quickly instantiated for single application execution, to prevent any exploit that occurs from persisting and to protect user privacy. It introduces the Virtual Layered File System to make instantiating containers fast and space efficient, and to make managing many containers no more complex than a single traditional desktop. We have implemented Apiary on Linux without any application or operating system kernel changes. Our results with real applications, known exploits, and a 24-person user study show that Apiary has modest performance overhead, is effective in limiting the damage from real vulnerabilities, and is as easy for users to use as a traditional desktop.",1277923346

I have a similar impulse -- whenever I see some program, protocol, or even hardware device, I want to learn enough about how it operates to form a good, thorough mental model.<p>Some immediate, relatively practical steps:\n- If you're not running one of the free Unixes, start now. I learned an enormous amount from first trying to get coLinux to work on my windows box and then actually installing various distros. That was four years ago, and things have gotten much easier (hardware support, guided installation, etc.), so you won't learn as much as I did, just as I didn't learn as much as the people who did it in, say, the mid-90's, but it's still worthwhile.<p>Distro: I currently run Debian, but I think for the purpose of learning, it (like a whole class of similar distros, like Ubuntu, RedHat derivatives, and even OpenSolaris) is too easy: it doesn't force you to keep learning past the basics in order to get it running and keep it running.

I've had quite a rough time with code organization, primarily because the physics of the game has a lot of frame-to-frame dependencies and I've been adamant about avoiding mutable state (because what is the point otherwise?). The Penumbra stuff provides frame callbacks, and you can return a state object which will be passed to you on the next frame. But even with that, I've still had some difficulty. I'm trying to implement a little macro language for animations, so that you could write, e.g.,:<p><pre><code>    (anim\n      (frames 3 :moving-to [x y])\n      (set-position [x y]))\n</code></pre>\nand have a block spend 3 frames in the ""moving-to"" animation, followed by an actual position update on a grid.<p>We have a state shuffling problem: this 'anim' macro has to maintain frame-to-frame state, and each animation frame also has to accept the gameboard and possibly return a new gameboard, in order to be able to update the position of the block in question. And I'm having trouble wrapping my brain around it. I really don't want to have to explicitly name a 'state' variable everywhere, although a state variable obviously needs to be passed.<p>This is the first time I've attempted to do something game-like in a Lisp.

1475679,comment,1475380,1475380,0,0,jacobolus,,,"> <i>But you get the point: technologists care about education.</i><p>Everyone cares about education. Everyone has a strong opinion about the way things should be, because everyone went through school and approaches the topic through their personal experiences. Unfortunately, most of that everyone is clueless (including most techies), and lots of their ideas are contradictory. That is why education policy (like all controversial/important policy) is fundamentally hard. There are no obvious solutions that everyone can agree about – if there were, we’d use them. Instead, it’s a constant hard fight to organize, educate, reach out, debate, and for teachers, just get on doing their jobs the best they can in their own classrooms.<p>Talk on this discussion board and elsewhere “the industry” being complacent and motivated to keep things “bad” is absurd. “The industry” is millions of individual teachers, parents, students, and administrators, all striving to do their best in their own little local niches. Unfortunately the big structural challenges are often difficult or even insurmountable, and kids end up suffering for it. This isn’t the fault of teacher’s unions (as Obama recently has been saying, parroting a longtime right-wing anti-tax talking point), and it isn’t the fault of “government”, and it isn’t the fault of any singly identifiable actor or institution. It’s just hard.<p>The post has the right overall idea though: put up or shut up. Do the work, whether that’s becoming a teacher or just helping out in a local classroom from time to time, or whether it’s developing new curricula, organizing people on the ground, etc. Just complaining without action is just nearly useless.",1277922242

We choose what to explore based on research about where bugs are likely to lie.  Exhaustive examination of all but fairly trivial problems is impossible for exactly this reason, and this is why we sample:  rather than force users to change the way they write code, we deal with the way they have written code.<p>Thanks,\nPete",1277920881

No matter what, you keep trying. Failure isn't a showstopper, just an indication that you need to modify your strategy. Keep plugging away at it and you to can find yourself with an overnight success after 10 years.",1277920880

Caveat - sometime it takes a little while for a new hire to be brought up to speed on exactly how a company does things, the code base, and so forth, but it is rarely as long as a month.",1277920864

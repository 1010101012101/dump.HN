7285183,comment,7282406,7284450,8,0,nirnira,,,"Why not? Legalising drugs destroys every single element which supports violent paralegel cartels.<p>1) It eliminates legal risk, so drug production becomes instantly a much more lucrative activity, enticing more people to do it.<p>2) Profits are reduced as the market becomes more competitive.<p>3) The cartels are unable to pursue their &quot;normal&quot; extralegal means of suppressing competition, because the parties they might seek to suppress now have legal access to state protection.<p>4) In a competitive, legal market, the successful firms will be the ones which offer the best product - the firms with the best drugs, the highest standards of quality and ethics, the nicest stores, and the best customer service. Why buy from dodgy drug-dealers when you can walk into a beautiful store and get great customer service?<p>In short term yes, cartels may attempt to protect their monopoly, but in the long term, legalisation dooms them as cultural dinosaurs unable to compete in the new legal, open market.<p>Edit: This analysis depends upon low taxation. High taxation will still incentivise extralegal selling, but it probably makes the black market a bit safer regardless.",1393138624

7285157,comment,7282406,7283707,1,0,nerfhammer,,,"Yes, governments are simultaneously short-sighted, cunning, inept, plodding, plotting, shambling, scheming and carry out very long-term schemes. But they&#x27;re also short-sighted and can&#x27;t do anything right. But also they do nothing unintentionally and 20 things don&#x27;t go wrong with their schemes. And you can understand governments best by thinking of them as having the motives of a single person in your hunter-gatherer band, who is too greedy and too powerful who takes too much and doesn&#x27;t give enough back. You can understand governments as you would by trying to read the motives of a single person, capable of thinking, coherency, making singular decisions, led by greed. Basically governments have all the properties of a action movie villain. Think of an action movie villain that isn&#x27;t motivated by greed or power lust, just like every political villain from all time ever. Taking too much and not giving enough back; betrayal. Or, wait, was I talking about the Greek gods? The natural world can also be understood as reading the motives of a person with human emotions that never do anything by mistake. Think of a movie villain that was more or less accidentally carrying out their misdeeds, mostly coerced by circumstances, blundering along the way. That wouldn&#x27;t be a very fun movie to watch. Villains always fully choose their evil, no circumstantial factors force their hand. Also Greek gods. And you can understand them by imputing their completely human motives; they always plot and scheme. You have to be able to guess the actions of the other members of your small hominid tribe. Every movie villain explains his motives and his long-winded scheme that would quickly fall apart in reality but that kind of realism wouldn&#x27;t make a good movie. Political villains however, are often as hopelessly inept as incredibly as they are cunning and good at carrying out multi-generational schemes. Scheming and plotting like a person would. Like Lothar over there by the fire who doesn&#x27;t give enough back from the hunt, or Runs with Horses over there who is amassing so many alliances as to be a possible threat to my alliances. Could he be planning to attack me, or take my stuff? Me, I care only about the tribe, for others in the tribe, the Real People we should care about, which also includes me of course. I&#x27;ve been doing a lot for the tribe lately. Could you help me tomorrow to rebuild my hut?",1393137528
7285156,comment,7282645,7283489,1,0,waps,,,"A lid seems a pretty primitive solution plus it wouldn&#x27;t help against feedback on the fish&#x27;s position itself. Furthermore it would obstruct the vision of the camera. If you&#x27;re designing a craft if possible you want to avoid the movement of the craft changing the control inputs. If not, and I&#x27;m betting this thing already experienced that, it can get into a feedback loop, either creating very &quot;shocky&quot; movement, or unbounded acceleration.<p>Instead, prevent having waves in the first place. Just like a person can move a glass without generating (large) waves in the liquid. What you want to do is to avoid using the position of the fish directly as input to the motor voltage. Instead, use it as an input to the control circuitry.<p>Then calculate the force generated on the fish : voltage is linearly related to speed. And the differential of voltage gives you the force on the boat/fish. So let the fish move and this sets a &quot;target&quot;, then every timeframe you bring the voltage, say, 0.01V closer to what the fish &quot;wants&quot; to set it to, limiting the force exerted on the bowl.<p>Btw: there will be a &quot;resonant&quot; value that will be relatively low in value, but will build massive waves. Avoid at all costs. In a project like this I might just assume I&#x27;m very unlikely to configure just the resonant value, but in a real project I&#x27;d make DAMN sure I knew what the resonant value(s) is/are and put in a warning.<p>You probably think that this will restrict the movement a lot but it won&#x27;t. Find the right values and you will hardly see any waves at all.",1393137518

Up until a few years ago I was only really comfortable with Java and always tended to think back to how I would do it in Java and try to translate it. But as I get more comfortable with other languages it&#x27;s gotten a lot easier. Especially with languages like Javascript and Python. I always laugh a little bit though when I go back to Java and wonder why a line with a String threw an error only to realize I&#x27;m using single ticks instead of double quotes.",1393135486

6855010,comment,6845585,6853077,1,0,yogthos,,,">Good. Except, next time you hire somebody, you may get accidents.<p>That goes for any project in any language. You simply have to mitigate these things in a way that makes sense for your team.<p>>Oh, certainly, but it kind of invalidates your claim that REPL + integration tests is enough to maintain a codebase.<p>My point was that REPL allows you to test things quickly and can be used for many scenarios that unit tests are often used. For example, when you refactor code you can test it on the spot. The feedback loop is much tighter when you work with a REPL.<p>>- integration with external tools (external database, LDAP...)<p>The goal is to test how your code behaves and not what the external tools are doing. In my testing I capture the expected response from the external system and replay it in the test. My interest is in what the application is doing with a given input.<p>>- amount of setup in your application necessary prior to running scenarios<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this setup is exactly.<p>>Well, considering that a well-tested unit of code (ie, what you put in a single file) is usually dwarfed in size by the test code itself, because you&#x27;re testing a lot of scenarios, then you either spend an unholy amount of time in the REPL, or you don&#x27;t test everything.<p>The point is that the integration tests are used to test correctness. As long as they pass your application is doing what it&#x27;s supposed to be doing. The REPL allows you to make sure that the change you just made does what you think it does.<p>>Which brings me to my second point: unit tests will run the same tests every single time. And even better, everybody in the team will run the same unit tests every single time.<p>Unit tests are also a huge overhead in maintenance. Any time you make a change in code, you have to go and update many tests. As you yourself point out, since you&#x27;re testing many scenarios your tests often have more code than your actual application. With integration tests, you only need to change your tests when the business logic changes.<p>>A REPL is no substitute for unit tests. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s not useful, because it allows you to validate an idea fairly quickly, especially in simple cases, but it is absolutely not suited to validate the correctness of a piece of code.<p>I don&#x27;t think unit tests are a valid way to ensure correctness either. Your individual pieces of code might be correct, but how they interact might be wrong. The only way to capture the actual use cases is by running end to end tests.<p>Conversely, as long as the end to end tests are passing that means that your application business logic works correctly. This is the only thing that&#x27;s relevant from the user perspective.<p>>I fully agree with that (though running unit tests on a single unit of code is very quick).<p>This of course requires you to write and maintain the test for each single unit of code.<p>>Sure. But in my experience: most codebases have little to no integration tests, and they cover things like &quot;make sure login is not broken&quot; or &quot;make sure saving an entry works&quot; as opposed to &quot;make sure login does not break with the login &#x27;null&#x27;&quot; or &quot;make sure we reject an entry which contains invalid XML&quot;, because the cost of setting up scenarios is much higher than with integration tests.<p>Your argument here isn&#x27;t that integration tests don&#x27;t work, but teams you worked with haven&#x27;t bothered using them correctly.<p>The same problem often happens with unit testing. I&#x27;ve seen many projects where people start out writing lots of unit tests, and then after a month or so things start sliding, then you have large swaths of code without tests and lots of failing tests, and then you just turn them off all together. That&#x27;s a very common scenario in my experience.",1386258826

I would be inclined to say that typos and grammar errors probably aren&#x27;t worth paying for - but that&#x27;s just me. If journals turn out to really care about those things, why not let them pay for them?<p>Heck, if they know ahead of time that that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re interested in paying for, let them forward the paper to a grammar expert and get even more utility for the money.<p>How much is each error worth, related to who pays. Well, make bounty funds and let each fund make its own choices. If a bunch of Christians really want to disprove evolution, let them put a massive bounty out on errors in biology papers. I imagine that such Christians wouldn&#x27;t care much about typos or grammar mistakes, they might care more for citation errors, and a lot more for errors in maths or evidence.<p>You pay for the truth that&#x27;s important to you.<p>And if the person paying disagrees with the person making the claim, then the person making the claim presumably doesn&#x27;t get paid. But if you keep doing that, then you damage your ability to buy truths that are important to you. Which is ultimately self-destructive. Bug bounties spring to mind as an example there. If the Christian fund never pays out, people will just stop working with the Christian fund.<p>And that&#x27;s a decent signalling mechanism it seems to me. If people claim to value the truth in some area, but they never pay out and no-one wants to work with them... then it&#x27;s probably a decent bet that they don&#x27;t really.

6854954,comment,6853990,6853990,2,0,throwawaykf,,,"Ahh, Bessen. Interesting that he cites his own &quot;trolls cost $29B&quot; study [1] without mentioning that it&#x27;s been &quot;called into question&quot; [2, 3, 4] to put it diplomatically. It&#x27;s not like he&#x27;s unaware of criticism of his work either, since he has responded to criticism in the past [5].<p>And par for the course, this article of his has several flaws as well:<p>1. Giving examiners the power of irreversible rejection is pretty bad, if you think about it. Valid patents are regularly rejected for the very same reasons that people argue invalid patents are allowed. Contrary to popular belief, if examiners are overworked and lack enough time, their default reaction is usually to reject the application. I have seen many a BS rejection issued because the examiner just wanted to meet his quota. And I&#x27;m not even a patent agent or lawyer!<p>2. (Nitpicking) Continuations are not the only way to continue examination after a rejection. You can also file for a Request for Continued Examination (RCE) and continue prosecuting the same application.<p>3. Continuations are a very valuable tool and not just fodder for abuse. Like TFA says, it allows applicants to claim multiple inventions off a single patent application. But that is often what happens! A single invention could have multiple facets that are inventions in their own right. As a random example, a lightbulb that uses tungsten filament and bulb with an inert gas could actually be three inventions: a) the material being used for the filament, b) the use of an inert gas in the bulb, and c) the combination of both that creates an even longer lasting bulb! What may happen is you file a patent for the combination but may realize each aspect is valuable by itself, and you may later want to claim them separately.<p>And sometimes, this is not in your control. A patent is allowed to only claim a single invention. An examiner may look at your claims and decide that they cover two (or more) separate inventions, and issue a &quot;restriction&quot;, which essentially forces you to choose one invention to continue. If you still want to protect the other claims, you have to file a continuation.<p>And even further: Companies regularly dump hundreds of pages of technical specs (or a professor dumps a dozen papers) on to a patent lawyer and ask them to file on all the inventions covered in there. Sometimes this happens under a pretty tight deadlines (e.g. the product has already been on sale, or the papers published, for almost a year, which puts a bar on when a patent can be filed). In that case, lawyers write up one gigantic spec, slap on claims for whatever they think is the invention, and file it. Over time, they can then sit the inventors down and hash out the real invention and cover them in continuations.<p>4. I looked at the file wrapper for the Apple patent. &quot;continuous&quot; was not the only word added. Almost a third of the claim was amended to make it more precise of what they were claiming. I personally don&#x27;t think this is a stellar patent, but such misinformation must be pointed out.<p>5. Strangely (or maybe not so strangely) enough, academics who write so much about patents have no idea how examination actually happens, or even how patents even work. To show invalidity, an examiner must show a one or more references that completely cover each and every element of the claim. If they cannot, no matter how obvious it seems to us, they have to allow it. The reason for this is that the decision must be an objective one, and all our opinions are inherently subjective. Supporting a rejection with previously published information, which is a recorded fact, is the only currently known way of doing this objectively.<p>6. Bessen implies other countries don&#x27;t have patent litigation problems because their examiners can issue an absolute rejection. First of all, I highly doubt that is the case - there always avenues of appeal. Secondly, he ignores the legal environment in other countries, such as &quot;loser pays&quot; in EU, which tend to discourage lawsuits in general, not just frivolous ones. Thirdly, this makes no difference in the quality of patents - I have seen a ton of US patents and their international counterparts, and they pretty much all have the same claims. And they can all be just as each other.

[1]<p>This definition of &quot;success&quot; is biased by most of our developed-world perspective. .  <i>tldr; - It will likely become &#x27;relevant&#x27; without becoming a &#x27;success&#x27; in the Western/1st-world sense.</i><p>.<p>Observations on why Bitcoin will struggle to become a ubiquitous currency:<p>1.) This statement from the PBOC - more or less negates its chances in China as being a &quot;first-class citizen&quot; (status) currency.<p>This comes as no major surprise to me. But, what <i>is</i> surprising is the portion which reaffirmed the legality of the participation in Bitcoin in China (&quot;... Bitcoin transaction as a commodity trading behavior on the Internet, ordinary people have the freedom to participate in the premise of own risk.&quot;), as you alluded to in your comment.  This more than &quot;leaves the door open.&quot;  That said, the factors which contributed to this approach are unbelievably complex and probably nefarious (w/regards to BTC&#x27;s future).<p>2.) In the USA, I don&#x27;t see a pressing need for it to be used in the way we know dollars to be used. The reason here is that we have a historically stable system in place.<p>3.) The volatility of Bitcoin is not, and likely will never be, as stable as most of the fiat units in circulation.  This would discourage me from paying my employees in Bitcoin.<p>4.) Since day one, we have all been apprehensive about the deflationary nature of the currency -- expressing the Keynesian-concern that spending in an economy is vital to the prosperity of said economy.<p>.<p>With that being said, here is where-and-why I&#x27;m long ...<p>I.) ... because of the international nature of the protocol, one must think about those living in Iran, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Russia, etc.. In those places, I think it has legs as a currency, regardless of state-endorsement.  Some of these states in crisis may even endorse Bitcoin.<p>I believe that perfection isn&#x27;t sought after in the 3rd world, as confidence has been lost in the fiat systems in place.  (This is the reason why greenbacks are so ubiquitous abroad.)<p>There&#x27;s also a palpable anti-American sentiment in the third world that <i>could</i> discourage greenbacks&#x27; usage by the layman if there were a viable and universally accepted alternative.<p>But paper greenbacks don&#x27;t play well with the internet. Bitcoins do. One can argue that you could still use greenbacks digitally abroad, but this is not without large transaction fees, and -- in the case of unstable countries -- there may uncertainty in the bank which is facilitating the financial services.<p>II.) ... it&#x27;s nature has melded the idea of a cash dollar and a digital dollar into a decentralized, ephemeral-yet-&quot;trustworthy&quot; protocol.  I can honestly say: I&#x27;d be a fool if I claimed to have the slightest idea how Bitcoin will innovate and make itself useful as a currency.<p>So, I actually believe that Bitcoin has relevance as a currency, just not in a way that would make sense to the developed world.<p>The above is part-and-parcel from Bitcoins as a store of value and other financial novelties, which I don&#x27;t really have the time to enumerate.<p>[0] - &quot;So much for the debate about bitcoin being a currency!&quot;<p>[1] - [and it saddens me greatly, because I&#x27;m a Bitcoin fanboy, and I&#x27;ve believed since the early days that Bitcoin is special in many other ways.

Changes I would make to fix patents:<p>- Get rid of license negotiation before the fact and replace it with attribution after the fact.  All patented ideas should compete for a bounded slice of the pie of products.  Attribution should be incentivized, but failure to attribute shouldn&#x27;t be penalized excessively.<p>- Instead of just letting a panel of experts (patent examiners) determine which ideas are novel and which aren&#x27;t, we should further let them determine how novel they are and award the most novel ideas bigger rewards.  The current system of granting a monopoly on an idea allows the patent holder to collect a large potion of the total value of an idea, which would be fair only for ideas that occur to just one person in the world.  In reality, almost all patented ideas (the good ones, anyway) occur to a number of bright people, even if they wouldn&#x27;t occur to a person having ordinary skill in the art.<p>- The patent database should be more like the collection of peer reviewed academic knowledge.  Ideas should be rewarded based on impact, rather than just who technically had the idea first.  We should reward high quality exposition of ideas instead of our current system that mostly rewards obfuscation.<p>Of course, all of this is even less likely to happen that the idea in the OP.  Abolishing patents or at least software patents would be preferable to the system we have now.",1386257588

(I could literally go on for an hour like this).<p>Things like TextureView, OpenSLES, and sampling rate are app specific and will be a challenge to deal with in general, regardless of platform level. Camera APIs are available in a good state going back to API 8 and 9, which are 2.x releases. Generally speaking, the majority of app developers will not have to deal with the APIs you are talking about, but yes they are flaws and your app may have to target higher API levels or have extra development if you want to support older devices for those things.<p>> Any nontrivial app needs load of work to properly support old versions. And then you can begin the real work: fixing vendor specific bugs.<p>Vendor specific bugs are always an issue even in the 4.x releases, this is something that cannot be avoided when developing for a platform with a lot of hardware variation.",1386257341

However I don&#x27;t think Ansible wants you to code all your logic in YAML.  You can easily write a plugin with Python and have all the proper syntax and capabilities of a programming language.<p>Where Ansible really shines is giving you a huge library of quality plugins/components and a simple YAML-based DSL for composing those plugins.  Want to spin up an EC2 instance, copy over your code, and ensure a service is started?  No problem, it&#x27;s a 4 or 5 line Ansible script.

7831495,comment,7830542,7830542,2,0,eldavido,,,"I think it depends a lot on (1) product complexity and (2) who the customers are.<p>Stripe has the luxury of a product with straightforward requirements (note this says nothing of the technical architecture/complexity of the product, just what it does -- &quot;process credit cards&quot;) and they&#x27;re building for other developers. In a company like this, it seems easier to prioritize based on developers&#x27; understanding of the problem.<p>Contrast that to a place like Zen Payroll (went to breakfast with a friend who works there today). ZP has to deal with complex tax issues, understand and prioritize feature requests from a huge array of non- to semi-technical customers, and deal with major PII/infosec compliance stuff. These kinds of problems really necessitate having someone on the team who will be the go-to expert for their domain, that can act as a &quot;customer surrogate&quot; in discussions of what&#x27;s important, how something will be used, the relevant laws/regulations/etc.<p>So to summarize, I think it&#x27;s less necessary to have a lot of product managers if you&#x27;re building a simple product for engineers. The minute you get into complex access controls, security roles, legal/compliance issues, multiple classes of customers, or complex multi-tiered pricing setups, you need a PM to make it all hang together.",1401674024

The amendment process was intended to allow the Constitution to remain a living document, and balance longevity with future flexibility.

If this were not intended, why weren&#x27;t additional restrictions placed on the scope of amendments? As it stands, Article V places the following limits:<p><i>&quot;... provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.&quot;</i><p>Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding some part of this paper, this seems more like a feature, than a bug.

7831478,comment,7830959,7831062,2,0,wpietri,,,"I would personally rather see a carbon tax; it&#x27;d be simpler. But I see three big differences with cap and trade that make it more practical.<p>One is that a cap-and-trade program acknowledges the status quo. There are a lot of businesses that are currently emitting CO2, and saying, &quot;Surprise! Big tax for you!&quot; will generate enormous political resistance. If I understand cap-and-trade programs rightly, we&#x27;d start out by giving those businesses the right to keep emitting, but let them sell the right if they aren&#x27;t using it. Suddenly they have choices, turning the response from, &quot;Rawr! Tax bad!&quot; to &quot;Hm, can I get a competitive advantage from this?&quot;<p>The second is that in cap-and-trade, the right price for carbon flows not from government fiat, but from market outcomes. What&#x27;s the right level for a carbon tax to drive the right amount of reduction 15 years out? Hard to say. Cap and trade lets us fix what we care about, the reductions, and then lets market mechanisms work out how to do that most economically.<p>The third comes from the combination of the first two. The US right is fervently anti-tax, and has been for decades. They are, however, pro-market, at least nominally. Plus, Wall Street loves anything market-like, as it gives them an opportunity to make a buck. A carbon tax will be fought hard by the people facing it before, during, and after. But markets mean winners and losers, and the opportunity for a lot of capitalist reindeer games.",1401673600

That \n  cult tells students that it&#x27;s not worth doing math unless \n  you&#x27;re the best at math—because those special few are the \n  only ones whose contributions really count. We don&#x27;t treat \n  any other subject that way. ... But I see promising young \n  mathematicians quit every year because someone in their \n  range of vision is &quot;ahead&quot; of them.\n</code></pre>\nBut this is a rational calculation, precisely because mathematics is institutionalized as a highly competitive discipline. If those who score high on the SAT at 13 are 100 times as likely to make a scientific advance as those in the remaining 99% of the population, then there should to be roughly 100 times the opportunity for lower scoring individuals to make those advances than they currently have. But the jobs in academia aren&#x27;t there. Students see this and they make the rational decision to jump ship. (I was irrational and did not.) The cult tells students that there are no jobs for you unless you are the very best. And with fewer tenure track jobs in a dwindling, pedigree conscious market, the cult is correct.<p>Grothendieck couldn&#x27;t solve a Putnam problem, incidentally. Not a contest winner. You might be interested to know what some Fields Medalists say about some prominent prodigies. That they are extremely smart, but haven&#x27;t done truly major work. The facts and the gossip are no consolation: academic opportunities are overwhelmingly and increasingly weighted in favor of the prodigy.<p>Likewise, elite employers want to hire the math and programming contest winners. Well, if you&#x27;re not one of them, it is rational to select yourself out. I&#x27;ve gotten calls from recruiters saying that I&#x27;d be working such winning individuals. &quot;Will I be doing the work they&#x27;re doing?&quot; &quot;Uh, no, you&#x27;ll be doing system administration.&quot; &quot;In that case, maybe you should hire a Nobel Laureate.

The rest of us are doomed to provide them support as members of the economic precariat at slave wages, if we are foolhardy enough to remain in academia. There is no honor in adding to someone else&#x27;s power law distribution, and I urge the contest winners to hire Nobel Laureates and other members of their own rank to do their support work, and not add to their winnings by exploiting the unworthy persons they elbowed out.<p>(I did earn a Ph.D. in mathematics, incidentally. This was wasted effort. When I was a toddler, apparently I impressed a child psychologist with my logic; my mother told the woman that she was an idiot for thinking that I was advanced.

For the second, they still allocated too many permits but the economic collapse in Europe led to far lower output than had been expected, and for a time declining confidence in the future existence of the EU led to a collapse in confidence in the long-term existence of the policy, making &quot;banking&quot; the credits for future abatement less attractive.<p>Finally, the cap is a &quot;backstop&quot; mechanism, which exists to ensure that the marginal abatement takes place, with inframarginal abatement taking place through, e.g., the Renewables Directive and the Large Combustion Directive as well as very high fuel taxes among many other mechanisms the EU uses to drive renewable energy and consumption efficiency.<p>The cap worked perfectly from a qualitative perspective - there is a highly visible price on carbon with complete capital market instruments available (forwards, futures, options, etc.) to give long-term investors what they need to make investment decisions. It has been the quantitative parameters that have not been ratcheted high enough.

In the US, we&#x27;re utilizing a school system that was designed 150 years ago and hasn&#x27;t changed much since.

If you&#x27;re a cognitive 0.01-percenter, being a corporate drone is going to be <i>way</i> more painful than a decent public high school. Trust me, I know both.<p>Now, one might argue that 0.01-percenters are just unlikely to end up in corporate drone jobs, all being tapped to become proteges of the Gordon Gekkos and Peter Gregories (RIP) of the world. The data don&#x27;t bear that out. The OP stated (a surprising fact) that the median income, at age 40, of these top-0.01% students was only $80,000. (I knew that the average income of prodigies was mediocre, but I was expecting $150-200k.) The number of 0.01-percenters who end up in corporate mediocrity is shockingly high.<p>The corporate &quot;real world&quot; is indifferent to the cognitive 1% (unless it comes with pedigree) and outright hostile to the correlates and eccentricities that come with being in the top 0.01%. The school system is doing its job. All that awful closed-campus stuff, the bells and no-backpacks-in-classroom rules, the hall passes and rules surrounding them, are inculcating a deference to authority that the corporate world still demands. And high school makes more exceptions for smart kids than any corporation. (Corporations might exempt political favorites from their bullshit rules, but that&#x27;s a different set.)<p>If we want to make a world where the cognitive 0.01% actually get to use their talents (and I fully support such change) and have some autonomy/power, we should make haste to fix the work world. A real fix, not this chickenhawking VC-funded bullshit that seems just as willing to fund turds like Evan Spiegel and Lucas Duplan. We should abolish the current corporate system and reinvent capitalism with the right people in charge. <i>That</i> is the best thing we can do for the cognitive 0.01% (and society as a whole, which benefit sfrom their work).

Log really detailed, invasive things and phone them home.

The other 30% to 50% that loosely associate themselves with Christian churches have only limited knowledge of what Christianity teaches.<p>Politicians, advertisers, tastemakers all are slowly realizing this declining influence and focus of Christian groups.  Many &quot;free thinking&quot; folks though still see Fundamentalist Christianity as the big bogey-man.  Those dabbling in the occult or most other religions are generally seen as interesting and as having no agenda to impose moral beliefs, and so are much less threatening and downright fun and interesting.  The California occult even had raucous sex parties, yay!",1401671699

We are Expensify and we do &quot;expense reports that don&#x27;t suck!&quot; (Google &quot;expensify&quot; to read more.) We&#x27;re getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren&#x27;s call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:<p>- An incredibly hard worker, even when it&#x27;s not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all — we do the sucky work so our customers won&#x27;t need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.<p>- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn&#x27;t a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We&#x27;ve done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?<p>- Super talented, in a general way. We&#x27;re going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job — you&#x27;re going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.<p>- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL — not because you know them all, but because you&#x27;re the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you&#x27;re this sort of person, you&#x27;ll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn&#x27;t for you.<p>And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That&#x27;s a problem because while I know you are awesome, it&#x27;s actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I&#x27;m going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don&#x27;t accidentally overlook you?<p>There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way to do that is to check out we.are.expensify.com and send in an application(which you can find at <a href=""http://we.are.expensify.com/apply"" rel=""nofollow"">http://we.are.expensify.com/apply</a>).

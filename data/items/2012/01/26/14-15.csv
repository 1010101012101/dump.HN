I believe he's thinking about this too narrowly.<p>The title of his post should be ""Are Programming Languages/Tools/Utilities Less Exciting Today?""<p>From that perspective, one may certainly claim to be bored. What goes around comes around, as those of us who have been around long enough can identify when the processing pendulum swings from client to server to client to server over the course of time. Back and forth, side to side, the more things change the more they stay the same.<p>But that's the wrong perspective to take. It limits the definition of someone, as a programmer, with their chosen tools. How many Enterprise-Java-vs-Dot-Net or PHP-vs-Ruby/Rails debates have ever made a difference in that regard? Programming languages, server systems, utilities, etc. aren't the path to the future -- they're the results of the past.<p>I prefer to think of programming as usage of these tools in solving problems, creating businesses, or just plain creating mischief. With that, I see wide open spaces to be addressed (and not enough good engineers to do it.) Hardly boring, in my opinion.",1327589881
3514356,comment,3514244,3514244,48,0,bluedevil2k,,,"After reading the article I have to question whether it really was profitable.  I think one of the mistakes that coders (and most business owners) make is to value a profit solely on the accounting values:  (income from the application) - (direct expenses of the application).<p>However, the true way to value profitability is to take a more financial perspective (financial being different than accounting).  A financial perspective would value the opportunity cost of working on this application compared to working on another application.  If the team spent 10 hours a week on the application, and those 10 hours a week could grow their other products by more than $75,000 a year, then of course the application isn't profitable.  It's actually losing money.<p>Another way to look at its profitability is to look at it from an operational standpoint.  The employees on the team would be consider a fixed cost (yes, they could hire more people, but that just changes the fixed cost).  The limited resource for this particular fixed cost is time, and from their article I can assume that their time was maximized (working as many hours a week as they wanted to). Operational theory says when a fixed cost is at its maximum utilization, higher marginal profitability items should be prioritized.  Basically, they are better off working on other items if they don't want to work more hours.",1327589832

The point of distribution packages is to run other packages in the distribution written in that language.</i><p>You're drawing a distinction between ""apps"" for users and ""packages"" that users don't directly use, and you're drawing it in a place that is not traditional for Linux.  When someone installs Amarok (or finds it pre-installed by their distro) they expect to find a music player they can use, not something that only supports the music player needs of the distribution.  In Linux, Perl isn't any different from Amarok.  It's an ""app"" that many users understand and use directly.  The packages you get when you install Perl using yum or apt-get are very much intended for users, unless Linux distributions want to depart from history and start treating programmers as second-class users compared to the ""normal"" users who would use a music player but would never use a programming language.  If vendors need their own ancient Perl distro to support their toolchain, that's <i>their</i> problem, and they should figure out how to accomplish that and still give users a usable, up-to-date Perl.",1327589777

3514352,comment,3513318,3513318,11,0,ynniv,,,"The midtown Atlanta example is all wrong. Yes, there are a lot of cars in Atlanta. Yes, there are a lot of parking lots in Atlanta. Are these parking lots required to sustain these cars? Not at all. The rates for parking vary wildly, because people only want to park near where they are going.<p>Those parking lots are not for cars, they are for flipping real estate.<p>Real estate in midtown has been booming for a little over a decade as small run down buildings are demolished and 10 ~ 40 story skyscrapers are built. That means huge increases in land value, which attracts speculation. When a lot with a small building is purchased, what happens next? If the building stays, it will have to be serviceable, and a tenant found, which will lock the property up until the tenant leaves. So the building has to go, and the property might need to be re-zoned from single family residential.<p>If you pave over that lot, not only do you remove unwanted structures and get the opportunity to re-zone, there will be some low-maintenance passive income generated from people using the property to park their car.<p>So ultimately, those parking lots are good for the city in the long run. They're useless eyesores right now, but are more easily converted into high density buildings, as they have been doing for the last decade. In fact the real problem with midtown is that there has been too much high density construction too quickly, and not enough people have moved in yet.<p>So as much as I love a naval gazing rant, reality is a little more subtle, and a lot more complicated.",1327589705

A well known professor in folk lore in Sweden said the universal thought is to use all parts from a slaughtered animal. Because in the old days you couldn't afford to throw anything away. The not so eatable parts was chopped to minced meat and the idea was formed, Swedish Meatballs. And you could even put old bread and flower in it and it would last longer. At the same time the minced meat is kept together better and gets juicier.<p>Meatballs appear in various forms in many countries. Meatball was introduced in the 1700s, along with coffee and cabbage rolls, after Karl XII:s return from the Ottoman Empire.\nKajsa Warg mentions swedish meatballs recipe in her book 'Hielpreda i hushllningen fr unga fruentimmer' meatballs of minced meat (veal, but also sheep or beef is said to work), bread crumbs and egg. They are seasoned with pepper, salt and nutmeg. Onions doesn't appear in the swedish meatballs until early 1940's.\nBig Cookbook 1944 brings a host of different recipes for meatballs. Including beef, veal and even ham. Here are several variations with meatballs containing both yellow and red onion, white pepper, paprika, tomato paste and cream or milk.<p>The first conditions for ordinary people to start eating Swedish meatballs came with the wood stove breakthrough in the 1850s. Then you could fry the meatballs in a pan on the stove. Before this most of the food was cooked over an open fire.\nThe second is the meat grinder that came about the same time.<p>Hoped you enjoyed a short curiosity about Swedish Meatballs recipe and history.",1327589299

3514280,comment,3513060,3513060,6,0,kevingadd,,,"Since going on the job market in November, I've been exercising an experimental policy: Interview with basically anyone (basic constraints apply - has to actually be a job I can do, a language I can speak, etc). It's been enlightening, especially because I'm at best a middling engineer (not a 'rockstar').<p>Virtually every company I've interviewed with has had tremendously awful HR, committing dozens of enormous mistakes that would have led me to abandon any interest in working for them (if not for my above-stated rule). I've learned a lot of interesting things from this experiment, but I think the biggest two are these:<p>A lot of companies screw up hiring from the HR side, but in general, the ones who mess up more than once tend to mess up a lot.<p>And in general, the ones with big money and big HR departments seem to be <i>worse</i> at interviewing and hiring than the tiny scrappy ones that can't even afford an HR department.<p>Just to give a few illustrative examples from the maybe 50 or so companies I've dealt with so far:<p>One big local developer scheduled a day-long interview that spanned lunch (starting around 11:30am and ending at 5pm), and knew that I had to drive an hour+ in traffic to get there. There was no lunch scheduled, they had me sit in a room and interview all day, even after I pointed out how little sense this made to the hiring director while I was on-site. They did not reimburse me for parking at their facility. This on-site was after a long series of successful phone screens. After the on-site, they told me personally that they would contact me with an offer, and then proceeded to completely ignore me for 2 months before a person I had never met before finally responded with something cryptic about an internal reorganization.<p>Another up-and-coming developer repeatedly made basic scheduling mistakes that made it near impossible to actually interview with them. Their hiring manager failed to e-mail me to notify me that a director would be calling in the early morning and also failed to tell me who he was, so when I got an unsolicited call from a stranger in the middle of a night's sleep, I asked if I could return his call, and he said 'no, I'm too busy'. This pattern was reinforced when they scheduled my on-site interview to begin 45 minutes after my flight landed (in a city where it took over an hour of cab travel just to reach their office). They compounded this by having me wait an hour and a half in the lobby before actually starting the interview, and having me interviewed by employees who clearly had not even been told my name.<p>The technical director of one well-funded studio contacted me out of the blue to ask if I was on the market and solicit my resume. After providing it, he sent me their 'engineering pre-screen', a series of around 10 moderately complex engineering and math problems that took me around 8 hours to complete (and probably would have taken someone more skilled at least 4 hours). A week after I submitted the completed screen, the technical director responded with a long diatribe about how my solutions to simple algorithmic problems should have used specific SIMD instruction sets or optimized for corner cases that were not specified, and commented that my lack of certain domain-specific skills made me an unsuitable candidate for a job he had told me nothing about.<p>In general, it feels like the average company hiring developers doesn't have a clue how to do it. It fills me with terror to think of how many potentially awesome candidates are falling at the wayside due to simple mistakes, and the idea that those great candidates end up at mediocre companies only because of HR mistakes is a rough one. Worse still, it's extremely rare for a company's HR department to solicit feedback on the hiring process - even companies that make me offers tend not to ask how it went. It seems likely that they do not make any effort to improve.",1327588590

They will spend much less time idle, can be parked more compactly, don't need to be parked near a destination, and can have a size distribution that matches the needs of individual trips (i.e., mostly very small.)  If they're cheap enough, then they'll be widely used, and wait times will be small.  Because they will be automated, they can be taken in and out of service very quickly, and there will always be about the right number available.

The point of distribution packages is to run other packages in the distribution written in that language.  That doesn't mean your own app should use the distribution package, unless you're planning on shipping it with your distribution.<p>For example, Debian ships with Perl because most of Debian's toolchain is written in Perl.  That means feature updates of Perl carry risk with little benefit; the packages work fine with the old version of Perl, but new versions of Perl may deprecate features that they're using.  So you can't just upgrade Perl because you want to; your OS won't boot anymore if you do.  If you have your own copy of Perl for your application, you can upgrade it (and required modules) whenever you want, and your OS is unaffected.  You derive more benefit from newer Perls than Debian does, because you are working on your Perl app every day.  Debian's app already works, and maintaining stability is more important than having access to new features.",1327588230

And I wanted Mono, but Ubuntu Lucid (a less than 2 years old version) comes with Mono 2.4. And seriously, tons of improvements have been made between 2.4 and 2.10. For OS X you just go to mono-project.org and download / install the latest package. That's it. No distribution upgrade necessary.<p>Mono is a special case, because quite a lot of apps which Ubuntu requires to work depend on it.  If you swap out the system Mono, many bets are off.  <i>However</i>, the usual way to handle this situation is a project-specific repository.  If the upstream supplies an apt repository, or pushes to a backports repo like badgerports, then you can install <i>just the version you want</i> without upgrading the rest of the system.<p>> For Ruby the development in Ruby-land is so fast that trying to bundle the latest JRuby or Rubinius would be a losing battle. And you also need packages installed only for the current user, if only because devs constantly experiment with beta-quality libraries and major versions have a habit of breaking backwards compatibility.<p>That's <i>precisely</i> what RVM is for.<p>> How are you going to solve that with DEBs or RPMs?<p>You're not, and shouldn't try.<p>> And you could say that Linux distributions shouldn't have versions and just upgrade stuff as soon as they are available.

I'll also add that I can't drive (because of an eye condition).<p>Australia is very much like California. Population density is low. Almost all of Australia is car dependent. Land sizes are large. This makes public transport largely uneconomic and unworkable, with certain exceptions (eg parts of Perth, inner Sydney, Melbourne). Even then, that transport is largely limited to going into and out of the city. If you want to go somewhere else it's a huge problem.<p>Gas taxes are much higher in Australia (petrol costs $1.40-1.50 per litre last I saw and there are ~4 litres to the gallon). I'm not sure if this covers the cost of roads and infrastructure (for the quarter acre dream) but I highly doubt it, especially once you factor in indirect costs.<p>London is a mix of inner London where public transport is very good and outer London (Zone 5+) where you are car dependent but you absolutely can get away with using car rental when you need it most of the time. The problem is public transport largely stops at midnight (apart from night buses).<p>Personally I found the light rail in Cologne (and Bonn) great and never felt the lack of a car.<p>You absolutely do not need a car in Zurich or pretty much all but rural Switzerland. Intracity and intercity transport is superb. Even getting to ski resorts by train/bus is fine.<p>Which brings me to NYC. NYC for me has the ultimate public transportation system. It's cheap, goes almost everywhere, runs 24 hours a day (HUGELY important IMHO) and unlike every other example listed above, cabs are actually relatively cheap, although there are oddities to the system (eg the peculiarities of shift change make it somehow impossible to get a cab to the airport in Manhattan at 3pm).<p>NYC also has an extremely large commuter belt covered by trains and buses such that no one I know drives into the city for work.<p>I live 7 minutes walk to work, which I love. Actually the idea for me is about 20-30 minutes walk each way because that's just about the right balance between time taken and getting some exercise (IMHO), particularly for us engineers.<p>What I don't see in this thread is the issue of people (like me) who don't have the option of driving a car. For this reason I can see myself largely living in either NYC or one of several European cities.<p>Charging homeowners fairly for their infrastructure costs is a hugely divisive and problematic issue. For example, hiking gas taxes would have all sorts of unintended consequences, not the least of which is inflation (since that cost is built into transporting food and everything else).<p>It seems fair(er) to build maintenance costs into property taxes and initial capital costs into land costs.<p>Peak oil [1] is either here or soon will be (IMHO we've already passed it). Arguably cities produce lower per-capita carbon footprints [2].  At some point people are going to need to realize that their gas-guzzling ways can't (and won't) continue forever.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/01/nature-journal-study-peak-oil/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/autopia/2012/01/nature-journal-study-pe...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.infrastructurist.com/2011/01/31/new-study-shows-that-suburbs-can-pollute-more-than-cities/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.infrastructurist.com/2011/01/31/new-study-shows-t...</a>",1327586707

It looks like it requires a combination of a carbon mic and an old, non-integrated-circuit switchhook. Something like you'd find in an old Western Electric 2500 [1].<p>A carbon mic has some pretty unique properties. Base output is very high, such that output is easily detected at a distance without amplification, and they're very low impedance. Even slightly newer telephone designs would use an electret style microphone. The most basic electret circuits require a capacitor, which is noted to defeat the frequency flooding attack.<p>1 - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_500_telephone#Model_2500"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_500_telephone#Model_2500</a>",1327586548

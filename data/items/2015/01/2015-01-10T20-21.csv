8867897,comment,8867538,8867538,0,0,nkangoh,,,"This is slightly off topic, but why aren&#x27;t folding bikes or scooters more popular? Their folding mechanism allows you to take them with you which would presumably prevent theft more than a lock. If a bike lock is the only thing that&#x27;s keeping your bike from being stolen it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;ll work more than it just delays the inevitable.<p>Plus aren&#x27;t locks really inconvenient to carry around with you? 10+ pounds is a lot when your bike is only 20lbs.",1420923573

8867895,comment,8866849,8867518,0,0,7952,,,"I think OneNote is an example of a good decentralised system. You get a multiuser wiki that only needs a shared folder to save. It is installed alongside MS Office and can be setup without any involvement from IT staff.  It is several orders of magnitude easier than installing MediaWiki and needs no big internet connection.<p>It is a big lie to believe that multi-user applications always need infrastructure, they just need to be well designed.  I expect that a very large OneNote system may need professional support at some point. But when it does the value is already proven without ever having to ask permission from an engineer.<p>You are right to be sceptical of cloud although perhaps for different reasons.  Amazon S3 is probably more secure and resilient than the typical corporate SAN.  But the random office in some small town will not have enough bandwidth to use it.  To the average user the corporate run services are exactly like the cloud; they are slow and not designed for them.  With properly design P2P systems normal users could actually choose their own tech again.",1420923531

8867885,comment,8867365,8867365,0,0,Blahah,,,"PhD student working on the C4 rice project here. On the road right now but happy to answer questions when I can find a moment.<p>I genuinely think C4 rice the best shot we&#x27;ve got at alleviating a huge chunk of world hunger in one (extremely difficult) move.<p>Some key points:<p>- C4 plants (like maize and sugarcane) are generally about 50% more efficient at biomass accumulation than C3 plants (like rice and wheat). C4 rice could mean a yield increase for rice of up to 50% _with no increase in inputs_<p>- RuBisCO is by far the most abundant protein in plants. It accounts for the majority of the nitrogen required by C3 plants, and the inefficiency of C3 is the reason we have to use so much nitrogen fertiliser. C4 rice would require considerably less fertiliser than C3 rice.<p>- C4 plants use CO2 much more efficiently that C3 plants. This allows them to keep their stomata closed much more of the time, so they lose less water through transpiration. This makes C4 plants much more water efficient - C4 rice could require much less water than C3 rice, meaning it could be grown on land that is currently unsuitable for rice production.<p>- C4 is probably the most interesting example of convergent evolution we know about. It has evolved over 70 times independently. This is quite amazing - it&#x27;s a complex trait that requires dozens of proteins to be organised in a particular temporal and spatial pattern, and needs a new cell type to be made. Yet it has evolved 70+ times.<p>- We are using the recurrent evolution pattern as our &#x27;way in&#x27; to the problem of figuring out how to control C4 at the molecular level. We analyse gene expression on a massive scale in C4 and C3 sister species from all the evolutionary origins of the trait.<p>- This involves a lot of interesting software challenges that hn might be interested in. For example, we&#x27;re working with so many species that we can&#x27;t sequence all their genomes. But we can sequence their _transcriptomes_, which is all the genes that are expressed at a given time. The sequencing technology produces millions of tiny fragments of the original sequences, which have to be pieced back together to be useful (an NP-hard problem).",1420923340

The effects studied in this work decay with a time scale proportional to the characteristic “size” of the particle. Furthermore, the contributions to the metric are relevant only if particle positions are not extremely larger than this characteristic size.

US-style PhDs don&#x27;t typically require a master&#x27;s degree first, so first-year PhD students are doing mainly course work and &quot;figure out what I want to do for my PhD&quot; project-shopping. If you do that for a year and bail, it&#x27;s pretty common that you wrote zero papers and did very little research. If you leave after two or three years, it&#x27;s more likely you will leave <i>some</i> kind of research contribution, although it&#x27;s also pretty common for people who realize they are going to leave to just &quot;pivot&quot; to full-time MSc coursework, so they can leave the program with a master&#x27;s degree.

Putting in strings requiring repayment if the person changes areas, when you&#x27;re giving someone <$100k, is pretty heavyweight for either the NSF or Y Combinator, so they just try to pre-screen for people they think are going to use the money as intended and stick with it, and accept that some percentage of people will instead use the money to flail around for a year or two and leave.

Providing value to society is not the same problem as selecting a single candidate from a set of candidates using a series of ranked preferences.  For starters, value could be a function mapping preferences to a real number or random variable, called &quot;utility,&quot; as opposed to individual ranked preferences.<p>(Also, even if it were relevant in any sense to talk about ranked preferences, they could still be consistently aggregable into a group preference -- Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem merely says they might not be.  It depends on what people&#x27;s rankings are.  Also, even if you replace the continuous set of options on how to provide value to society with a finite, discrete set of options, and then if you talk about a marginal penny of spending instead of spending at large, so that you can finally get people talking about a set of ranked preferences, you&#x27;ll find that as you iterate elections of how to spend the marginal penny on a penny by penny basis, people&#x27;s preferences change from election to election as laws of diminishing returns set in.  For example, if you had five discrete option on how to spend money and assuming any reasonable degree of smoothness, such a series of elections would result in a spending distribution such that no simple majority thinks that the next marginal penny should be spent on a given option. )<p>I really can&#x27;t understand how you could possibly bring up Arrow&#x27;s impossibility theorem unless you&#x27;re just trying to &quot;win&quot; an argument by bringing up some obscure mathematical reference that nobody wants to bother understanding so that they can respond to you.

The bike cost roughly $2,700 & I used it nearly every day to commute.  Not once did I ever lock it up anywhere.  When I&#x27;d get to class or wherever I was going I would remove both the wheels & lock them to the rack.  This whole process took seconds for removal & assembly with the quick releases.  I&#x27;d then cary the frame like a bag.  At a bit over 14 pounds it wasn&#x27;t an issue to just take it with me.  At one point I even had a clip to attach it to my backpack.  It sat quite nicely next to me at my desk, even in lecture halls & was never really a problem.  Only once in four years did a university security guard ask me to take it outside and lock it up.  I asked why and he said: &quot;university policy doesn&#x27;t allow bikes in the building.&quot;  I responded that it wasn&#x27;t a bike.  It was a frame and would only be a bike when assembled with wheels which it wasn&#x27;t when in the building.  He of course thought I was being a smart ass and escalated the situation to a supervisor who told him to back off.  I honestly had more run-ins with business owners who didn&#x27;t like the fact I was wearing cleated shoes on their polished floors.<p>At the end of the day, I&#x27;d like to understand, I really would.  Why do people lock bikes they care about on the street? Is it simply a function of not knowing how to use quick releases to pop the wheels off?  Is it a space issue?  I lived in some pretty tiny places but there was always wall space & toothpaste was always perfect for covering the holes for the bike wall rack when I moved out.

This seems an almost comically unrealistic chain of events for the average case.

I&#x27;m being a bit high-level-hand-wavy with this, but it seems to get the point across (I hope.)<p>My takeaway being, I&#x27;m curious if there have been people who have addressed this potential conundrum (and if you even see what I stated as a problem at all.).

8867758,comment,8866694,8867675,0,0,sapek,,,"1) I didn&#x27;t do a good job explaining this. You are right that if you want to materialize an object during deserialization you need to know a schema at build time to generate your class. But the crucial things is, and this is true of all similar frameworks, you don&#x27;t know the schema of the payload at that point. One big reason you use something Protobuf, Thrift or Bond is to get forward/backward compatibility. What this means in essence is that deserialization is always mapping between schema you built your code with and schema of the payload. There are two common ways to do that mapping: (a) payload has interleaved schema information within data and you perform branches at runtime based on what you find in the payload (this is what Protobuf, Thrift and Bond tagged protocols do) (b) you get schema of payload at runtime and use that information perform the mapping (this is what Avro and Bond untagged protocol do). The latter case is particularly suitable for storage scenarios: you read schema from file/stream header and then process many records that have that schema. This is the case where having ability to emit code at runtime results in a huge performance win: you JIT schema-specific deserializer once and amortize this over many records.<p>2) You can do both. You can also do type safe transformations/aggregations/etc on serialized data w/o materializing any object.",1420920732

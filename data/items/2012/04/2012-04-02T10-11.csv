On the winbox I learned Assembler, on the linbox I learned to program, that made the big difference for me.<p>Is it still that way for others or is the current situation on windows better?

It was slow and clunky at the same time as awesomely cool. Windows 386 was even better. Then IBM launched OS/2, and we did our level best to like it, install and use it, but it never really felt that good. It needed too much RAM. It didn't support our legacy apps (not many of them, anyway) and the UI felt weird.<p>On the day Windows 3.0 was released internally, on the IBM network, I think just about everyone who used a PC downloaded the seven or so floppy disk images needed to install it, and we were passing them around like a crack pipe. Everyone wanted it, and this was apparently happening all over IBM UK. Although it's ultimate demise took a long time after that, we all knew it was basically over for OS/2 at that point.

3787375,comment,3785672,3785820,31,0,JumpCrisscross,,,"I was a quant prop derivatives trader at an investment bank.<p>The correlation between MtGox/USD [1] and GLD daily returns over 12 April 2011 - 30 March 2012 is 0.02; a linear regression produces a 0.151 beta (GLD daily returns independent) with a coefficient of determination of 0.0004. GLD had a period return of 14% with an average daily return (standard deviation) of 1.4% (0.1 percentage points); MtGox/USD had 531% with 10.2% (1.3 percentage points). It thus seems like it could have a place in a portfolio above (in terms of risk) small cap and emerging market stocks (on your worst day in GLD you lost 5.5%; in MtGox/USD 35.8%. Also, GLD delivered 2.7 times the return per unit of risk). Methodology note: since MtGox trades every day and GLD only on trading days, I used closing prices for trading days.<p>Bitcoin takes the monetary system back essentially a hundred years. We know how to beat that system. In fact, we know how to nuke it for profit. Bitcoin is volatile, inherently deflationary and has no lender of last resort. Cornering and squeezing would work well - they use mass in a finite trading space. Modern predatory algos like bandsaw (testing markets by raising and suddenly dropping prices), sharktooth (electronically front-running orders), and band-burst (creating self-perpetuating volatile equilibria in a leverage-sensitive trading space, e.g. an inherently deflationary one), would rapidly wreak havoc. There is also a part of me that figures regulators will turn a blind eye to Bitcoin shenanigans.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60ztgSzm1g10zm2g25zv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/mtgoxUSD#rg60ztgSzm1g10zm2g2...</a>",1333363173

However, at the end of each of these articles, while interesting and well written, I am left with the feeling “who the hell are they to tell people how to do <insert advice here>”. Posters are habitually giving advice, generally with no credentials or basis for what makes their advice relative. And it becomes hearsay and opinion rather than solid advice based on facts.<p>I am really partial to the ‘real’ stories about people’s successes and failures that give good background and relate facts and experiences. These are the articles that I learn from. Not the “Doing x and y for business success, by nobody in particular”. The difference is we have credentials and background on the poster. The other types of posts remind me a little of pop culture radio DJs who have a whole lot to say about nothing and they end up talking over the songs (or good posts in our case).<p>So pull your pants up HN.

We could learn about them if we wanted to ""fit in"", but we often find them just plain boring.  Why would we do something boring just to get the attention of a bunch of kids who like boring stuff?  Why not do stuff we find interesting, like math or reading, and be popular with the minority who also find those things interesting?<p>(Disclaimer: I'm actually quite the sports nut, as well as a huge nerd.)",1272311977

1295792,comment,1294872,1294872,0,0,ggchappell,,,"Interesting, but I wonder whether Go-style ""go routines"" and channels would be a better choice to implement.<p>First, it seems like they would be easier to write in C++. You're mostly creating a new kind of pseudo-container (channel), instead of trying to fake adding new syntax to the language. (Although you <i>do</i> still need to have some mechanism for executing a go routine, somehow ....)<p>Second, its a more powerful abstraction. With go routines it's not hard to implement something with the functionality of Python-esque generators, but you can also do fancier things that you would have a difficult time doing using only generators.",1272311908

Prices you find in databases/charts for stock prices are already split adjusted.<p>For example, Apple PowerBook G3 250 (Original/Kanga/3500): Price stated at $5700 released on 11/10/97.  On 11/10/97 AAPL closed at $18.37/share.  If you spent all $5700 you would have 310.3 shares (assume you can buy partial shares).  On/around 6/5/2000 the stock split so you would now have 620ish shares.  On/Around 3/28/05 stock split and you would have 1240ish shares.  Multiple this by the stock price ~$270/share and you have ~$330,000.  As someone already pointed out, you should not take into account inflation because the $330k is the amount you have have in the bank TODAY if you had bought the stock back on 11/10/97.<p>If you look at the stock chart you will see the price reports on 11/10/97 for AAPL is $4.59/share, this accounts for the split (It was actually $18.37 on that day, but divide by 4 because of the splits and you get $4.59).

1295737,comment,1295418,1295683,0,0,jerf,,,"Are you familiar with the logic as to <i>why</i> we ""don't negotiate with terrorists""? It is not because the people saying that are waving their dicks around and showing off. It is because when you do negotiate, you encourage other terrorists to try terrorism next week. Today's hostages may die, but they are saving tomorrow's hostages, and the next day's, and the next day's. It is brutal calculus, but it is the only sane answer. The cost of being nice here is death; it is a net cost of lives.<p>My solution is simple: To tell the extremist elements that they can't dominate our discourse, and to meet both threats and any attempts to follow through on those threats with all the force necessary to dissuade them. The ""nice"" answer is wrong and has all sorts of ""not nice"" results. And however hard this may be to believe or accept, the potential losses of knuckling under to terrorism are <i>unbounded</i>. Because the thing is, it's not about the grievance they say it's about. There's an infinite supply of grievances, and even if there wasn't, if you leave the decision about whether you've discharged the grievance in the hands of the terrorist they can always decide you haven't done enough. What it is about is that they can get more benefit from the terrorism than it costs them. That is what you must be concerned about, ensuring that the costs of terrorism exceed the benefits, and one easy (and arguably necessary-but-not-sufficient) way to do that is to make sure they don't get benefits. Official ""Draw Mohammed"" day is a good solution on the side, by raising the costs of terrorism.<p>Any policy that has the end result of moving the cost/benefit advantage of terrorism in the direction of ""benefit"" is wrong, especially any that cross from net-negative to net-positive. Regardless of how ""nice"" it is. Regardless of how well-cloaked in moralistic bibble-babble it is. And it will be so cloaked; the ability of humans to rationalize the short-term convenient answer is nearly unbounded. This is part of the basic contract of civilization and operates at a lower, more fundamental level than most people are used to debating at, in that if terrorists are allowed to tear apart civilization (the ultimate end result if this policy of appeasement is followed), most of the rest of our debates are rendered moot. The first order of business is make sure we still have a civilization in which to have our arguments about what it should be.<p>I've gone down to this level because it's <i>really important</i>. The US remains a ways away from this being a serious problem, but I am concerned about the number of draws we're making against this account without depositing things; we're a ways from bankrupt here but the trend is strongly negative lately.<p>I have carefully referred to ""nice"" policies rather than naming names, but in most cases there are, shall we say, <i>correlations</i> between political parties and the ""niceness"" of their policies; applying this discussion to their country's policies is left as an exercise for the reader. But there is definitely a time and a place for ""not nice"" policies, if you actually want your civilization to survive.",1272310968

Here in the United States, I had imbued the idea that high-IQ people are disliked because they are smart, and that above a certain IQ, a person has no hope of having a friendship relationship with a person of average IQ. (I especially got that idea from a short story by Philip K. Dick<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_K._Dick</a><p>I read when I was in ninth grade, but in fact this idea that high IQ causes an inherent social gulf is commonplace in Western literature on education of gifted children.)<p>I got a big surprise when I arrived in Taiwan. I found out that in east Asia, the cultural assumption is that there are few finer uses for intelligence than getting along with other people. It is expected that anyone who is generally smart will be able to make friends with lots of people. (This emphasis comes straight from the writings of Confucius and the successor Confucian philosopher Mencius, which I studied in the original literary Chinese as part of my language studies.) It helps, of course, that Chinese-influenced culture in general also honors literacy and intellect in a way that is not quite as direct or pervasive as in Western culture, but the main point is that the 知識分子 (""intellectual"") is a person who has his own responsibility to get along with other people and lead society (by EXAMPLE) so that all of society is harmonious. Once I learned not to whine to myself so much about how people don't appreciate me because I'm so smart (doesn't it sound gauche to hear me say that?), I learned to appreciate my fellow human beings a lot more, and succeeded in making more friends. I'm glad I went overseas to learn a new perspective, a perspective that helps me now that I am back in the United States. Confucius had a great saying about how to appreciate other people and learn from all of them: 三人行，必有我師焉 (""wherever three persons are walking, my teacher is surely among them""). I can learn from anyone in my environment, and I can make friends with more people than I realized at first.",1272310574

The status quo, myspace, was a public-only profile.  A facebook profile was accessible only to your contacts or to your school. The available options have slowly but continuously drifted away from that simple promise.   A lot of the site's initial traction was driven by huge demand for a reasonable set of privacy controls: myspace was useful but creepy.    The argument that the web has moved on in the past six years and that the demand for privacy has lessened is perhaps a red herring, though only time, consumer demand, and viable alternatives will tell: there might be more of an opportunity here than people realize.<p>Overall, I think this is a really interesting question that society is confronting and it will be fun to see how it plays out.<p>Side note: I think a lot of the tech press and blogosphere miss a lot of the subtleties here because, well, people like Arrington, Scoble et al. weren't in school at the time, making the cautious decision to open an account.

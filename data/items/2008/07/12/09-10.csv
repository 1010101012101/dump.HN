But I guess that's a little confusing...<p><i>what's the crux of saying that high status females produce less?</i><p>My point is that, the same behaviors that men can use to achieve high status, if women use they're frowned upon. Even if they succeed in using said behaviors to achieve a higher status, cultural resistance applied a force restricting the spread of those memes to other women. (For example, talking behind someone's back about 'whipping' employees or coworkers, or ad-homeniem/targeted/unfairly focussed attacks, such as on Martha Stewart or Hillary Clinton or Kathy Sierra <a href=""http://headrush.typepad.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://headrush.typepad.com/</a>)<p><i>what kind of mathematics is that used by the evolutionary biologists?</i><p>Some do a lot of analysis, or combinatorics. I'm actually more interested in a complexity approach, in the manner of stephen wolfram, because there's a lot of complexity which I think can't be easily engineered out -- it's better simulated.",1215856566

Of course, this would backfire at some point, but who cares,  they made their money in the bank,  who cares on what happens 10 years down the road, the goverment will bail them out, right...?<p>I really hope the goverment doesn't, and just let them go down.  It would be fun.   Actually houses will end up being affordable for those people that live honestly within their means, have good credit, stable jobs, and a good amount of savings,   while the irresponsible wont be able to even get a mortagage anymore,  (or one with reasonable rates).",1215856447

244433,comment,244221,244399,0,0,DaniFong,,,"<i>The easiest way to prove something is genetic rather than cultural is to examine different cultures throughout the world, especially isolated ones like pygmies or aborigines.</i><p>I agree that this is easy, but I am not sure that it is in fact accurate. To do so you must show that the particular cultural values you're exploring do not share anthropological linage. This is a very difficult problem. How do you propose to handle that case?<p><i>The paradigm of man as provider and woman as nurturer, and the mating ramifications of that (i.e. women preferring men who are able to provide, which most closely translates in our society to wealth, and men preferring women more fit to raise children, which in our society most closely translates to healthy appearance) are virtually universal.</i><p>So would you draw the line from this evolutionary argument like so: men have a greater instinct to produce wealth or high status, which causes them to produce more startups.<p>The problem I have with this is that's its so vague. If we don't actually try to nail down or postulate an actual theory, people can be lazy and undisciplined in their thought. They might say, for example <i>""here are some good reasons that the sexes might be intrinsically different; any existing difference is just the way things are, due intrinsically, and due to genetics""</i>. My point is that the disciplined way to approach this question is that you actually need to make specific predictions, or you risk degenerating into religious war.<p>So, <i>in which ways</i> is this instinct for men to provide manifested?<p>Compared to startups, law or medicine or finance seems a surer method to acquire status and prestige, and you probably come out ahead on average. More women are in these fields than in startups.<p>And physical science and engineering aren't particularly high prestige careers, nor do they make much wealth, nor do they seem to improve procreative chances. And these fields are particularly male centric.<p>So then usually someone points out that men like to take risks. They aim for the massive payoffs. If that's so, one should examine the <i>structure</i> of risks that men take versus women.<p>So, we have a set of hypotheses, backed up in varying amounts by data. Men are much more likely to do one off things to impress people. I guess this is called machismo. They're much more likely to take physical risks, or health risks. They may be more likely to take risks in their social stature, so long as they have little to lose. They're more likely to risk the state of a relationship for some impulse, someone or something that they want.<p>By contrast, I postulate, women are more likely to risk themselves emotionally. They are more likely to invest themselves in one particular friendship or relationship, even if it risks not panning out. Men, by contrast, <i>fear commitment</i>. They're more likely to keep their eggs out of one basket (see especially, for example, studies on the messaging patterns and viewing patterns and requests and satisfaction on dating sites). Women are <i>more</i> likely to invest themselves emotionally in some community, cause, person, or idea.<p>Doesn't this sound like a startup?<p>It's striking how many female entrepreneurs describe starting a startup like having a baby. Mena Trott (in founders at work) describes it like having a chemical in your brain that blocks out the painful moments, leaving only the other ones in memory (This effect is described also of pregnancy, and recently they've actually discovered that <i>such a chemical exists</i>). Are women more ready to devote themselves like this? Are women more emotionally prepared for a startup? Perhaps.<p>So, we have <i>conflicting</i> attitudes towards risk. On one hand, we postulate, men are more likely to be driven by promises of extreme status and wealth. On the other, women are perhaps more emotionally prepared, in some areas, when they get there. It seems like this should be a fairly balanced game.<p>But it's not. Female founders make up 3% of the YC pool. The risk and wealth hypothesis can't handle this alone.<p>Something has to take up the slack. And I think that it has much to do with the fact that different memes that define success in this society propagate to men and to women.",1215855868

244423,comment,244221,244382,0,0,whacked_new,,,"<i>Existing cultural bias might just be a carry over from prehistoric times, entirely irrelevant to whether or not there are now meaningful differences in aptitude, in this, the present.</i><p>This is easy to show: superstitions and religions. Then, reverence of those closer to gods. Religion is almost completely cognitive, and so only humans are able to develop, propagate, and perpetuate it. It is also cognitive in the sense that children are not developed enough to invent it themselves. This fits the ""entirely irrelevant"" category.<p>But for other things that can be explained loosely by behavioral drift, the chicken and egg problem remains. Perhaps a small, innate difference was exacerbated by culture, creating a sustained, artificial specialization; this is also the byproduct of the human tendency to generalize. Not saying it's the most efficient, but in most cases I would say there is nontrivial relevance.<p><i>I never claimed equality ... a difference many dozens of times that.</i><p>This I agree with. The examples of risky behavior like dating strange men and running away though, I'm not so sure if they make good comparison; it is possible to look at these behaviors from another angle (behavioral/biological), but that's not to devalue the point you made.<p>About sperm of high status males. High status males produce more offspring, several of which can be females, who inherit the status. Upon rereading I realize I'm confused about this point. How are males's status not also spread through memes (disregarding relative degree)? I suppose you'd say they are, then what's the crux of saying that high status females produce less?<p>Another clarification, what kind of mathematics is that used by the evolutionary biologists?<p>Above questions are for my own interest and I won't follow up on them. I mostly agree with you, but I'm fairly sure ""completely dominates"" is an overstatement, and I went about throwing pebbles because you asked.",1215854208
244421,comment,244221,244398,0,0,DaniFong,,,"My theory is that there are two types of fundamental 'evolutionary units' that are important when discussing humans. Memes, and genes. I agree that, when memes were unimportant, the genetic influence, for females, of an outstanding capability to provide, would be largely wasted.<p>However, massive wealth only became possible once human culture grew, and then, for reasons I outlined below, <i>memes</i> became far more sticky, more influential, and more important, by comparison. In this, women have a greater <i>evolutionary</i> incentive to gain wealth or prestige or spread memes, but <i>not</i> a greater <i>genetic</i> incentive.",1215853884

244419,comment,244221,244401,0,0,DaniFong,,,"a) irrelevant with respect to what? The point of this is that it contrasts with the case for memes. Memes are directed towards the different groups much more strongly, and so by that force you'd assume that they're more likely divergent.<p><i>I don't think anyone suggested that ""dominant, decisive, intelligent, women"" are any less likely to start startups than ""dominant, decisive, intelligent"" men.</i><p>That is in fact more along the lines of what <i>i'm</i> suggesting. I think that conditioned on the same startup traits, women are actually less likely to start startups due to cultural factors, of which one of the strongest is the cultural disincentive to risk. My specific claim is that the cultural disincentive strongly outweighs the innate tendency.<p><i>I'd define the characteristics that drive one to start up differently</i><p>I too, but these were the traits on topic.<p><i>b) Perhaps you have cause and effect backwards.</i><p>My central hypothesis was that women, currently, face more resistance than men in spreading any memes that create high 'provider status'. And that under the model postulated, you'd expect the evolution of memes to dominate genes.<p><i>And Hillary Clinton is getting a lot of the treatment she is now because her refusal to concede for a long time when it was clear that Obama would be the nominee has been potentially very destructive to her party.</i><p>Her maltreatment long preceded that moment -- the media has consistently typecast her as 'icequeen' or 'man', and I have heard that sentiment abundantly reflected.",1215853492

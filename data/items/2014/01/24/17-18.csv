Browserify and Bower both integrate the Node.js module system into client-side JS.<p>You basically get a unification of backend and frontend languages -- both using JS, the same dependency and versioning system, the same way to require modules, and of course the same code. Being able to use the same libraries on the backend and frontend is huge. (But not required. Browserify/npm are still useful if you don&#x27;t use Node.js.)<p>And it&#x27;s cleaner. Relying on the Node.js dependency system means you can just import modules the same was in Node.js, instead of maintaining an ugly &quot;vendor/&quot; folder where you manually copy things like jQuery.<p>I suspect (I haven&#x27;t gotten this far yet) that you can more easily unit-test your code this way. You just need a &quot;headless&quot; browser environment (using jsdom etc.) that&#x27;s compatible jQuery.<p>Browserify is actually very small tool. It leaves all package management to npm, and all Browserify does is to generate a JS file that includes all your package.json-specified modules in neatly namedspaced dependency-initialization order, ready to be imported using a script tag.<p>There is also Bower [2] from Twitter. Unlike Browserify, Bower is mainly a wrapper around npm that acts as a separate package manager, but doesn&#x27;t actually implement the glue needed to import any JS on the client side.<p>[1] <a href=""http://browserify.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://browserify.org</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://bower.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bower.io</a>",1390586320

In the big bang, all matter existed at a single point in &quot;time&quot;, but we are confused about why there is more matter than anti-matter, correct?<p>Would it be at all possible that perhaps at the big bang or prior, the universe was more balanced in it&#x27;s symmetry or perhaps even anti-matter existed in greater quantities than matter, but at some point there was (again, forgive my lack of physics knowledge) some sort of a collapse or antimatter blackhole which generated the big bang, and as antimatter collapsed in on itself and was spewed out the other side it became matter, with a side effect of quantum entanglement (since the matter (previously anti-matter) had existed at the same point in time (or some groups of matter had at least)). Now here is the key part, what if anti-matter isn&#x27;t the opposite of matter, but it is indeed the preferred state of matter (eg, matter seeks to become anti-matter) but the only way that it can do so is to mass together until it becomes a black hole and collapses back into the anti-matter universe? (which would explain the lack of anti-matter where masses of matter exist)<p>Crazy lunatic layperson hypotheses:\n 1) Matter can become anti-matter and vice versa.\n 2) There is a natural tendency for balance in the universe.\n 3) Black holes are where matter goes to become antimatter.\n 4) White holes are anti-matter becoming matter\n 5) Gravity and many other observable effects are side effects of this process.",1390586053

7116235,comment,7114144,7115994,5,0,mbreese,,,"The PowerPC as a processor really was a powerful chip. And it was arguably more powerful than contemporary Intel chips. It&#x27;s hard to directly compare the two because to unlock the performance for either architecture requires an optimized toolchain. I&#x27;m not sure that the toolchain Apple was using was ever quite up to par with Intel. But since they are difference architecture styles (RISC vs CISC), it was really hard to get a good comparison. On HPC workloads, the Power chips were really good. I&#x27;m not sure that ever translated to workstations well.<p>The differences between the PS3 and Xbox 360 processors and toolchains is probably a good analogy. While in theory the Cell of the PS3 is more powerful, it was easier to get the Xbox to work optimally. (Although, ironically, they were both PowerPC based CPUs).<p>But the reason why Apple changed over to Intel chips had nothing to do with raw performance. It had everything to do with power - as in watts. Apple was beholden to the PowerPC manufacturers (Motorola/IBM) for their chips.<p>The major markets for PPC chips was either at the very high-end (HPC) or the very low-end (embedded). While Apple was the main customer for the mid-range chips, they didn&#x27;t have much relative volume, so they didn&#x27;t have much sway in the chip roadmap. Because of this, it was difficult to get high-performance/low-power chips. Apple went for years with a G4-based Powerbook because they couldn&#x27;t get a G5 version that would work in a laptop - it required too much power.<p>The reason why they switched to Intel was that Intel was already working on the high-performance/low-power chips that Motorola just couldn&#x27;t offer.<p>The PowerPC architecture itself was very high-performance, but recent years have shown that raw performance isn&#x27;t as important as performance per watt for consumer use. If you&#x27;re building a super computer, that&#x27;s another story. From a pure CPU architecture standpoint, I&#x27;m still a fan of RISC.",1390585953

Right now, you can still subvert most TLS deployments by subverting the DNS, because everyone trusts CAs who provide signatures that rely on unauthenticated MX record lookups followed by cleartext SMTP connections.<p>DNSCurve is a reasonable replacement for TSIG, and I&#x27;m all for deploying it on that basis, but it doesn&#x27;t make sense to give up on signed records.  Signed records are at least non-repudiable, which provides some disincentive against forging them at a higher level in the tree.  The DNSCurve proposal is to basically just hand over your private keys to a bunch of machines that are probably owned and operated by third parties, in an environment where they can forge arbitrary records at will without any accountability.<p>Sure, there are problems with the DNS being a hierarchical protocol, but we still need authenticated DNS and we need it yesterday.  DNSSEC isn&#x27;t a great solution and we certainly can&#x27;t <i>stop</i> at DNSSEC, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re better off without it.

Same goes for icons in toolbars etc.<p>The vast majority of developers simply scale down icons and other assets to fit the various sizes Apple requires, so in practice the retina approach just means the same assets being scaled resized and cropped lots of times by developers to jump through the hoops Apple requires, and the problem is only going to get worse.<p>So I respectfully disagree, there are no easy solutions in this area, however I think resolution independence has better possible solutions than designing something as vector, then manually producing scaled rasters at every possible display size. At the very least Xcode should take care of that, but I&#x27;d prefer if iOS did, and accepted vector images within apps to start with - it could easily cache bitmap representations as it needs them, and then it could change those on the fly when screen sizes/resolutions change instead of requiring new binaries.",1390585276

The consoles are still successful at selling new games for $50+.  Nobody is doing it for Android or iOS as far as I can tell.

So any start-up currency has a &quot;growth phase&quot; during which its value increases exponentially. It will never make sense to spend a start-up currency during this phase.<p>The utility of the currency will depend on how many vendors ultimately accept it.

He didn&#x27;t build a business that operated around hosting arbitrary images, that happened to be adopted by bad people for bad purposes.  He was a bad person himself, who built a bad website, to assist other bad people.  These are two <i>very different</i> things.<p>I mean, I understand how you could imagine some <i>other</i> website, a neutral website, that was unintentionally adopted by bad people for bad purposes, and that <i>other</i> website could do the same sort of damage, unintentionally, that this website did to its victims, intentionally, and that hypothetical situation is sort of similar to this one if you look upsidedown and squint.<p>But in the moral code of most people (for example, mine) and for that matter the US legal system, it&#x27;s important not just that you have bad <i>effects</i>, but that you have a bad <i>intent</i>.  This is why, for example, murder is different than manslaughter.  In both cases somebody is dead because of your actions, but in only one case did you form a specific intent to kill another person.  (And manslaughter is, for the record, not &quot;no intent&quot;, but it is a lesser kind of intent, like firing a gun into a building without regard for whether or not it is occupied.  It&#x27;s a bad intent, just not bad enough to be murder.)<p>I think where hackers get hung up is in some sort of weird Net Neutrality-ish argument where any packet is as good as any other packet, and so a packet that carries revenge porn is just as legitimate as a packet that carries cat videos.  Packets are neither good or bad but just <i>are</i> and all packets have the same legitimate claim on arriving to their destination as any other.  And if you are designing a router, that sounds like a very sound principle to me.<p>But in the courtroom, we are not prosecuting packets, but prosecuting people.  And people are more than just a function of the packets they send.  They have motives, they have intents.  They construct a conscious plan to do good or to do evil.  And that is how they are judged.",1390584783

I&#x27;m baffled that people could be sanguine about also giving them control of <i>encryption certificates</i>.<p>DNSCurve doesn&#x27;t authenticate DNS data. It authenticates the connection between the client and the server. It does that because authenticating the data requires boiling the ocean by getting a huge portion of the Internet to agree on and implement a scheme to authenticate data, and authenticating individual connections works even if you and your server are the only people who agree to do it. DNSCurve solves a less ambitious problem than DNSSEC does, but that problem is (a) the most important problem in DNS security and (b) actually solvable, unlike the DNSSEC problem.",1390583167

Moore&#x27;s law or not, science and technology advance by making things cheaper at an exponential scale - computational power, DNA sequencing, etc. As business now becomes closely integrated to science and technology now deflationary forces are being harnessed.<p>I suppose there are three views on fighting poverty. Reality likely is a mix of the last two. One sees billions of people consuming at a first-world level. Obviously impossible. The second sees the worlds population decreased dramatically. That is somewhere between disturbing and terrifying. The third involves a massive deflation in the cost of living by providing goods and services extremely cheaply (and I would also add sustainably.)<p>That third path will be a major shock to those in the first world who believed their skill sets made them members of the world&#x27;s 1%.",1390583084

Sometimes it&#x27;s aggressive downvoting of an idea that doesn&#x27;t align with the status quo despite validity for discussion, sometimes it&#x27;s aggressive upvoting of an idea that aligns better, sometimes it&#x27;s an aggressive amount of churn as various subgroups battle for &quot;placing&quot; the item, which results in the item being read as a net 0.

8587192,comment,8585483,8586877,0,0,thirsteh,,,"Yeah, you could have said the same about Haskell. &#x27;forkIO&#x27; in Haskell and &#x27;go&#x27; in Go are essentially identical. You could also argue that Haskell&#x27;s STM is even safer than using CSP channels (which also exist in Haskell) since you greatly decrease your chance of data races (while sacrificing some performance in cases where a transaction is often retried.)<p>But in the end it doesn&#x27;t really matter that much.

It is obvious where he wrote &quot;Ever notice how people who make claims about why they got banned never provide links to the posts in question?&quot; is borne of deep frustration.  He would like to follow those links and improve the site, but can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s obvious that his comment is written out of frustration.<p>Let&#x27;s be very clear: hellbanning is the <i>worst</i> and rudest thing that exists on any respectable Internet forum.  Hellbanning literally wastes hours of the time of people who contribute great insight for free.  The comments on this site are  good and provided for free by people.  Hellbanning turns this goodwill on its face, like a goodwill jar you can put bills into but which go into a furnace.<p>Daniel (and PG) knows very well that hellbanning is a nuclear weapon and the rudest thing that any Internet forum can possibly do, that is actually being done.<p>You have stories of people only learning they were hellbanned after literally taking the time to email someone a link to something thoughtful they had written.  A lot of hellbanning has been (historically) in error.<p>It is one of the main reasons that I would never consciously leave a comment up if it reaches -3, even if I stand by it 100%, it&#x27;s important, and the community happens to be wrong in its groupthink and I clearly have explained why.  I would delete it instead.<p>Note that I have <i>learned</i> this behavior, and so have other contributors on this site.<p>It&#x27;s one of the things that makes this site great.<p>So even though it is a nuclear option and the <i>worst</i>, <i>rudest</i> thing that any respectable forum does, in the sense that time is money literally stealing from users, and stealing donations at that and throwing them away, at the same time it is one of the things that allows this site to function as one of the best sites on the planet.<p>So you can bet that Daniel is extremely serious about following hellbanning claims and improving this process.  It is difficult and he walks a very fine line.<p>He&#x27;s doing a fantastic job at present in a very difficult undertaking.  Kudos, Daniel, and keep up the good work.

Specifically, they want to voice their opinion that they agree or disagree with a comment. For most cases, this is pointless. It doesn&#x27;t contribute to a conversation, it doesn&#x27;t provide any context, and often it&#x27;s more emotionally driven than anything else. But I get that you want to reduce the noise of unnecessary comments.<p>Instead of confusing what a vote means to a user, why not provide meta-votes that reduce noise while allowing users to voice their opinions? Provide a series of buttons with default responses, and allow the comment box to be the &#x27;Other:&#x27;. Record these responses and provide a tiny graphic next to a comment that indicates some value based on the accumulated opinions of users.<p>What this would give you is the ability to change sorting based on emotional and/or intellectual feedback. If you have a sub-thread that has 200+ intellectual feedback, you could float it up to the top of the stack, and keep emotional feedback as a lower priority. People would be able to express themselves clearly and you could disagree with someone morally while ceding that they may have a valid argument.

8587052,comment,8585597,8586713,0,0,peterwwillis,,,"Well first of all, I disagree with your assertion that top comments with contrary viewpoints might prevent groupthink. Sometimes being contrary is inherent to groupthink. And being well-written and productive doesn&#x27;t mean the comment is insightful, intelligent, or informative, which one assumes would be a preferred top comment. (personally I think promoting comments that are well-written, productive and contrary just gets you a class of people who can bicker in a very civilized manner, like two English gentlemen having a polite row)<p>Why do we vote in directions? It would appear that according to social media, we only have one orientation in voting (vertically) and can thus only go in two directions (up and down). But this makes no sense. For one thing, the &#x27;direction&#x27; of a comment/conversation may go many different ways... conversations do not go in a straight line. And the idea of &#x27;elevation&#x27; in a conversation is also confusing: if anything, a conversation would be more three-dimensional than two, moving around a changing landscape.<p>In addition, &#x27;up&#x27; and &#x27;down&#x27; gives an immediate subconscious reaction where &#x27;up&#x27; is associated with goodness (and therefore correctness) and &#x27;down&#x27; with badness (and therefore incorrectness). I say this moral implication is the default because it makes no sense for only one direction to be correct, unless you needed to know where you were supposed to go, and your default assumption was that you should never go down. (That would be a bad presumption for airplanes, for example, as they would never land until they ran out of fuel)<p>So what does it mean when HNers &#x27;vote down&#x27;? Are they agreeing with something, or disagreeing? Are we assuming they&#x27;re trying to impose a nuanced influence on a particular part of a person&#x27;s commentary? If it was a generic part of their comment, was it their moral or ethical stance, or their writing style, or the correctness of their comment? We have no idea; all we know is they wanted that comment to go &#x27;down&#x27;.<p>A simple vote down, regardless of its supposed intent, doesn&#x27;t provide any specific benefit if it comes without context. The <i>lack</i> of a down vote would do the opposite, however: it would force people to only be able to provide positive feedback, or no feedback at all. How does this effect group dynamics? It actually works on individual behavioral conditioning: provide positive feedback, and you get positive behavioral conditioning, and negative behavior gets weeded out automatically (because the individual wants to be rewarded, which it knows it only gets for positive behavior). This is what practically all dog-trainers and child psychologists suggest as the best method to promote positive behavior. This would have two similar effects: people would be nicer, and they would provide &#x27;better quality&#x27; comments.<p>So I think &#x27;downvoting&#x27; is a loaded and useless way to regulate comments. I think that valid alternatives would be votes for specific feedback, or if you wanted to provide a way to simply &quot;move thread position&quot;, a button that said so specifically. These would create specific, immediate changes in the group dynamics and the interactions of the users, unlike a generic downvote button. If you&#x27;re trying to prevent groupthink, give the users tools to allow them to express themselves better.",1415658998

8586996,comment,8585483,8586815,0,0,timtadh,,,"I feel like you haven&#x27;t met a lot of Go programmers in that case. The
programmers I have met who use Go or are interested in it are often genuinely
good programmers. Of course there are &quot;crowd&quot; followers in any language as
popular in Go but Go is not a &quot;Blub&quot; language nor does it attract Blub
programmers.<p>Do I as a Go programmer sometimes wish that Go had feature X. Of course I do! I
want that feature when I want that feature. But, I find Go to occupy an extremely
practical position in my personal programming language continuum do to its
fairly unique mix of features. Note, it is not the features themselves that are
unique many languages individually have them. Indeed, they often also include
features I miss in Go. Rather, it is the particular mixture which is useful.<p>EDIT: To respond directly to the Blub article.<p>Features pg calls out for LISP:<p><pre><code>    Garbage collection, introduced by Lisp in about 1960, is now widely
    considered to be a good thing. Runtime typing, ditto, is growing in
    popularity. Lexical closures, introduced by Lisp in the early 1970s, are
    now, just barely, on the radar screen. Macros, introduced by Lisp in the mid
    1960s, are still terra incognita.
 </code></pre>
Go score card:<p><pre><code>    Garbage Collection [x]
    Runtime Typing [p]*
    Lexical Clusures [x]
    Macros [ ]

    * Go has some dynamic typing capabilities but nothing like Python or LISP.
      Many would consider that a &quot;good thing&quot;. It partially depends on what you
      are doing.
</code></pre>
Go has a 3/4 on the score card of features. Macros are of course enormously
useful but also very difficult to shoe horn into a c-family language properly
since they need to be expanded at compile time (unless you just go ahead and
embed you compiler backend into the runtime system of your language. That would
be kinda of crazy/awesome but you could do it). Rust has of course proven the
utility of such a choice.<p>I can&#x27;t speak for pg, but Go has many fantastic features and is not a Blub. The
features which are missing are not, by and large, features of LISP.<p>EDIT 2: To add some more fuel to this fire...<p>pg concludes the article with:<p><pre><code>    During the years we worked on Viaweb I read a lot of job descriptions. A new
    competitor seemed to emerge out of the woodwork every month or so. The first
    thing I would do, after checking to see if they had a live online demo, was
    look at their job listings. After a couple years of this I could tell which
    companies to worry about and which not to. The more of an IT flavor the job
    descriptions had, the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind were
    the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those.
    You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they
    wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that&#x27;s
    starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run
    by real hackers. If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers,
    I would have been really worried.
</code></pre>
Note, he explicitly says here: not all languages are the same. He would
<i></i>worry<i></i> when a company wanted Python programmers. Why? Because to him Python
mixture of features represented a nice chunk of what LISP is providing him.
Let&#x27;s do another score card:<p>Python Score Card<p><pre><code>    Garbage Collection [x]
    Runtime Typing [x]
    Lexical Clusures [x]
    Macros [ ]*

    * It is somewhat possible through black magic hackery to create an AST level
      macro in Python. It is messy. It is cool. It&#x27;s kinda crunky. And I am not
      sure anyone has ever seriously used this ability. It certainly isn&#x27;t main
      stream. Checkout https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy for inspiration.

But if we think about the details there may be some parts of the process that you aren&#x27;t counting:<p>Keep in mind, I&#x27;m not actually trying to be sarcastic or annoying, but these are points I&#x27;ve actually thought about on my own that add up when you really think about it.<p>1)  shopping (it takes me approx. 1 min to go onto my front porch to get the boxes of Soylent and bring them inside).  If I&#x27;m making soup on a weekly basis, you have to figure for - Gas for car to travel to grocery and back.  Time spent shopping.  If you&#x27;re in a complex, lugging the groceries up flights of stairs, unpacking and putting into refrigerator.  Possibility of long lines at check out.  Bad weather.<p>2)  Refrigeration / spoilage (With Soylent, there is no need to refrigerate until you mix it together).  If you want to purchase 1 month supply of ingredients for soup, perhaps some of those ingredients will go bad by end of the month.  They almost certainly won&#x27;t be as fresh as they were at the beginning of the month.  That is if you&#x27;re trying to make a healthy soup.<p>3)  Nutrition.  I am unaware of any soup whose ingredients are engineered to contain all the vitamins, minerals, nutrients, etc. that a human body needs in a day.  Granted we don&#x27;t know everything there is to know about human body and nutrition, but I&#x27;m going to guess I&#x27;m far less knowledgeable than the staff at Soylent given that it is their job to know.<p>4)  Preparation time.  I have eaten canned soups before, so if heating refrigerated soup is anything like that, you&#x27;re spending at least 3 min at the microwave per meal, so though it&#x27;s minimal it&#x27;s more than it takes to (a) open refrigerator, (b) get a glass, and (c) pour.<p>5)  Cost.  For 1 month supply (on subscription) Soylent costs $255 (shipping included).  This is technically 28 days worth, so this comes to a little more than $3 per meal.  To make a soup as nutritious as Soylent, you will almost certainly spend more than this.<p>These are the main points I can think of.",1415658034

That&#x27;s one of the worst assumptions I see in systems languages -- even C++ (before C++11) got this entirely wrong.  Swift gets this wrong, Go gets this wrong. Rust is probably a little better because it actually has a static idea of memory scope, but I haven&#x27;t seen a way to swap out the memory allocator in various contexts.<p>Most projects I&#x27;ve been involved with have used region/arena allocators.  Not only do you mostly avoid the non-determism of your average GC, but you avoid the hassle of fine grained reference counting (in most cases).

It sprang the ideas of full OO onto the programming community, it&#x27;s guru&#x27;s brought us Agile development techniques, Refactoring tools, ChangeSets (Git has this now), Everything is an Object and many other ideas and concepts prevalent in today&#x27;s languages and tools. Many languages freely admit the inspiration of Smalltalk to their ideas and have expanded on Smalltalk&#x27;s ideas. Some people have continued to expand Smalltalk itself. Even it&#x27;s original creator (Alan Kay) hopes for a better system than Smalltalk, but even recently he says he hasn&#x27;t seen it yet and has called Lisp the &quot;the greatest single programming language ever designed&quot;.<p>Company&#x27;s like JPMorgan (Currency Trading), Booz Allen & Hamilton (Currency Trading), Sprint (Network Topology and Configuration), Digital Switch Corp (now Alcatel) (Digital Cross Connect), TenX Technologies (C source code maintenance and analysis tool), American Express (Full IDE for a custom in-house Credit processing language) and Nortel (Meridian PBX line Configurator as well as Configurator for the Nortel Wireless Modules used in cell towers) have used Smalltalk to great ends and gotten competitive advantages and accomplished great things with Smalltalk.<p>There were lots of others projects that used Smalltalk to create systems that they had failed at previously or did not want to tackle due to the enormous complexity.  OO and specifically Smalltalk gave them a way to implement these systems in an Agile way, long before Agile Manifesto was dropped onto the world. Remember ST at the time embodied the most mature implementations of the OO paradigm and it&#x27;s power was not meet for many years. No other language gave the bang for the buck overall.  C++ was still being standardized thru the early 90&#x27;s.  At the time and up until Borland shipped their Turbo C++, most compilers were incompatible with one another and/or generated C code because they were based on ATT&#x27;s C-front system, which itself was being fluidly developed.<p>I worked on those examples listed above for those companies and knew of many others working on other projects. I also happened to work with C++ from 1989-1993 while porting tools such at SUN Tooltalk and SUN Net License to IBM&#x27;s AIX boxes as well as Porting the Mentor Graphics ECAD products and core libraries to AIX and DEC Ultrix and OSF/1.  We had 14 hour compile times, even with 128 Meg of memory (which at the time was huge) using the $150K box on my desk. I had also worked with Obj-C on the NeXT systems and IBM RT system and several OO Lisps including CLOS.<p>Each of those systems had good points and enabled different things, but Smalltalk and the tools it provided and the amazing productivity that we were able to accomplish was amazing.  Fixing bugs in the debugger, stepping back one call on the stack-trace and continuing on (no stopping the whole program and starting again) [Fix and Continue that worked every time, not just some of the time like the C++ and Java versions), adding capabilities to the system itself, being able to inspect and see anything at any time, seeing all the code for the system and adding to that were amazing and still are.<p>The title is misleading in that &quot;Nobody&quot; is not the right word for the title. It&#x27;s safer to say &quot;few&quot; people use it.  But those that do have reasons as diverse as why there are so many languages that programmers use now and why the number of languages being created is going up.  We as programmers use languages for many reasons, including their relative power, alignment with our own thought processes, libraries available, community, religion, syntax preference, etc.<p>Don&#x27;t buy into group thought when looking at any language. I also think that no one language is going to solve all your problems.  Much like we have AWK, SED, etc. we can use the language that helps us in that moment.  Smalltalk is just one of those languages that is available and for many uses it still is very applicable.<p>Sam Griffith Jr.",1415657587

If, however, you feel downvoting should be a more rare occurrence, it makes some sense to relegate downvoting to a worse position, especially in light of the seemingly frequent issues with accidental clicking.<p>I also find the single leading upvote to be a bit more consistent, as you are not able to downvote replies to your comments, only upvote. So in that regard, the UI would be a bit more uniform regardless of whether the comment was a reply or not.<p>Another straightforward possibility could be replacing the arrows with words, and making the time a link to the comment (removing &quot;link&quot; from trailing actions as gojomo suggested).

A neat, easy to understand one is: <a href=""http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/downloads/pdf/rcix-oopsla-2013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~steveb/downloads/pdf/rcix-oops...</a>.<p>Also interesting is what you can do when you have more information about what pointers can point to (as in Rust). It&#x27;s not so much that reference counting in Rust is cheap, but that the language offers a lot of tools to let you avoid reference counted pointers in the first place, in favor of references with static lifetime guarantees.<p>[1] What Swift or Obj-C do when you overwrite a pointer-valued field is to do a objc_release() for the old pointer, and a objc_retain() for the new pointer. If two threads write to a field at the same time, you can corrupt the reference count (even if the objc_release()/objc_retain() operations are themselves atomic!) As far as I know, Apple&#x27;s obj-c runtime does not attempt to handle this situation.

We had a gentleman over to interview for one of our account executive positions at 42Floors.  He had strong experience leasing SF office space:  great resume, great cover letter, did well in our initial phone screen.<p>> When he walked in the door, we could hear the clacking of his shoes on our hardwood floor.  He was dressed impeccably in a suit that probably cost more than my first car and was carrying one of those leathery-thingys that seemed to exist only for the purpose of being carried during interviews.<p>> I stole a glance to a few of the people from my team who had looked up when he walked in.  I could sense the disappointment.<p>> We’re all happily wearing blue jeans and sneakers.   It’s not that we’re so petty or strict about the dress code that we are going to disqualify him for not following an unwritten rule, but we know empirically that people who come in dressed in suits rarely work out well for our team.<p>> He was failing the go-out-for-a-beer test and he didn’t even know it.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20140618142018/http://blog.42floors.com/interviewing-at-a-startup/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20140618142018/http://blog.42floo...</a>",1415657011

Debating the prison&#x27;s respect for Sunde&#x27;s vegan wishes misses the forest for the trees.

Prison&#x27;s not something you can just try, to see what it&#x27;s like, so unless you&#x27;ve been there it&#x27;s usually wise to assume the worst things are true rather than being optimistic about rights and common sense.

A good user interface, with a good set of features, with good performance and reasonable resource requirements.  If all you want to do with your word processor is edit documents, Mac Word 5.1 was a close to optimal solution for many users.",1213800864

And how do you propose to do that when the field evolves so fast that most technical books go out of date within 2 years?<p>There doesn't <i>need</i> to be any such consistent way. What there needs to be is already there, for the simple reason that what is there is driven by exactly that: needs. Where absolute reliability is required (e.g. NASA), programs are written with that kind of discipline. For the rest of us who are ok with living in a giant, glorious mess of creativity, why should anyone dictate how we do things?",1213800440

Imagine a site where I could start my own reddit/HN type space with a unique url. I could then control who comes in (be it co-workers or friends) and have a place where we could all privately share links and start discussions. Great for companies, project groups, families, friends, etc...<p>I know I won't have time to build this, but I think somebody should.",1213800137

The one file I glanced through was readable, straightforward, and concise, the hallmarks of good Python style.  That's a very good thing, but I'm wondering if they've done anything especially clever, or implemented anything generally applicable beyond the realm of discussion sites.<p>Not that they should.  Clear, concise, readable, simple code that builds on existing, open code wherever possible is a wonderful recipe for success.  But I'm still interested in whether they went beyond that anywhere.",1213799886

I'm no Pythonista, but I think the code for such a highly trafficked site built using Pylons is interesting.<p>Isn't it unprecedented that such a highly trafficked site, owned by a large, decidedly Corporate company (Conde Naste), would become open source?  Open sourcing web _sites_ is rare (applications, such as WP, Drupal, etc, not so much).  Now Reddit is a web app (sort of due to it now being 'sold' -- although for free), but you could argue before that it was a web site.<p>Now it is trivial to start a new community, just like the old community.  Eventually every community hits a critical mass of popularity and articles and discussions factor to the lowest common denominator.  When it hits the limit (as Reddit did a while a go, in my opinion) someone can start a new one without much work.<p>Or, maybe I'm just an open source geek with a soft spot for Reddit.",1213799361

And niche markets are probably the best way to achieve that.<p>I actually hope this will be disruptive, and popular sites return to servicing their audience directly instead of relying on Digg, for example. Digg has become so popular that it almost needs it's own nested-digg now, a rather ironic self-defeating problem with social popularity and vertical growth. I mean, don't get me wrong... I suspect Digg will continue forward and be hugely successful.<p>Hats off to the reddit team.",1213798654

117985,comment,117938,117962,0,0,matstc,,,"There is a lot of talk about what should be done in order to keep the community as it is, about what is a relevant post and what's not. But we have no metric to measure the cohesion, except for 'pleasure'. The analysis in the post is of course incomplete but I believe there is value in a metric that could tell us whether or not we are being steered away from the initial community.",1203317609

On my revisit I still couldn't read it through entirely. It looks like one of those handouts that presents an unspecific problem, to which it throws a bunch of unspecific waypoints that lead to an unspecific solution.<p>I suspect you see something that I didn't; how do you approach reading this?<p>Also, between reading and coming back, you have been downvoted once. I have no idea what is downvote-worthy in your post... sometimes I just don't know what I am missing -- or if there is anything to miss in the first place.",1203317279

117978,comment,117727,117806,0,0,SuperThread,,,"I think that you have to distinguish between wars in which the outcome is uncertain—that is, wars in which real risk to both sides is present—and wars that are essentially a big guy beating up a little guy.<p>I agree that the former kind of war would happen with the same frequency if this pen pal idea were implemented—the motivation for such wars need to be large enough to overcome the personal danger that they produce, and so would easily overshadow semipersonal connections with citizens of the opposite side. I think that the latter would very much be deterred, though, because the motivation for such wars can be miniscule, to the point where even the humanization of the ""enemy"" could be a significant deterrent.",1203316867

117970,comment,117963,117963,0,0,dkokelley,,,"Hmm. You still have to consider the distributions of linux that are in fact very expensive. Look at Novell's distro. It's so fancy you can only rent it a few years out. That common man's XP you can keep pretty much forever. It will still be interesting to see the results of his experiment, though I think he will need more time to make a solid conclusion. One week doesn't seem like enough to me.<p>P.S. I know my argument about Novell ignores the fact that he was using pirated examples. I'm pointing out that even similarly priced OSes don't get as much market share as windows.",1203315906

Lets just agree to disagree on the rest.<p>Second, I never questioned the basis of your opinions, you questioned mine (indirectly).<p>Finally, maybe you should have spent more than two seconds googling, since MIT CS does not ask for your GRE scores.

117962,comment,117938,117938,0,0,Spyckie,,,"Thanks for posting this interesting data set, but after thinking about it for some time, I don't think this data offers any insights into yc.news. The leader to user ratio is too high, which skews all the numbers so that nothing really meaningful can be extracted. It's also hard to spot any trends from the point system alone - user identity, time of post relative to other news, and the controversy of the post content can play important factors in the post's point value, and all of these don't necessarily have any correlation with the user who posted it. I think in order to figure out something about the community, someone will have to get their hands dirty and actually look at post content.",1203314583

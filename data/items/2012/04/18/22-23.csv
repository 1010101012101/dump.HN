3860638,comment,3859685,3859685,20,0,krschultz,,,"We often seem to forget that passion is not a singular thing.<p>My #1 passion in a lot of ways is politics/history/debate. I'm probably better at standing in front of a room of 800 people and giving a speech or fielding a hostile question than anything else I do. If I followed my passion/strengths I probably would have gone to say Georgetown, gotten an economics degree, and found my way into the DC path of being an aide and then into being a candidate myself.<p>But much like the author of the article, I can't emotionally handle it. I get so worked up that my blood boils, I get enraged, and I know I would die of a heart attack at age 30.<p>So instead I went to my second passion - engineering. When I told most of my friends and teachers in high school that I was going into engineering they were all shocked.<p>Yet when I tell my engineer co-workers that my original passion was politics, they are all shocked. I do not talk about politics with co-workers (or on HN for that matter), I keep the two worlds entirely separate.<p>Maybe I'll go back to it someday, we all know the Congress could use more engineers. But sometimes we throw around 'passion' when we really should say 'like to do'. I like to be an engineer, the problems are interesting, and it's definitely fun to build things as a hobby. But I'm not passionate about differential equations or FEA modeling. Those things don't get me fired up with adrenaline or keep me away at night like my real 'passion'.",1334789451

Prices will decrease marginally, but theres no way to know to what extent prices would fall.<p>Thought experiment: SpaceX is able to lasso up a 100% diamond asteroid and bring it to earth. Suddenly supply of diamonds is 1000x what it was expected to be that year. Diamonds will be worth marginally less as a result, however, it does not mean all that diamond asteroid is worthless. I am sure diamond mines would close for a bit as that asteroid is likely cheaper per unit than some other methods. Suddenly because diamonds because relatively cheaper they can begin to be used for all kinds of currently uneconomical uses. Maybe diamond fiber becomes the next typed of networking cable, or diamond asphalt makes our roads last forever, or diamond knives become all the rage for top chefs -- I don't know, but we'll find a way to use cheaper diamonds, and that asteroid is going to be worth a boatload no matter what.<p>Wish I had more time to think about this, but work calls.",1334789066

Writing APIs is very tough, you will get a lot of things wrong, and the fixes available to you after you realize your mistake are all ugly at best.<p>One quick example:<p>In CUDA, you have to explicitly copy memory to and from the GPU. We have two basic kinds of memcpy functions--synchronous and asynchronous. Asynchronous requires some additional parameter validation because the GPU has to be able to DMA that particular piece of memory, etc. After we had been shipping this for a release or two, we noticed that our parameter checking for the asynchronous call was missing one very particular corner case and would silently fall back to synchronous copies instead of returning an error. We thought, okay, let's just fix that by returning an error because surely no one managed to hit this.<p>Absolute carnage. Tons of applications broke. This particular case was being used <i>everywhere</i>. It provided no benefit whatsoever in terms of speed; in fact, it was just a more verbose way to write a standard synchronous memcpy. People did it anyway because... they thought it must be faster because it had async in the name? I don't know.<p>In the end, we made the asynchronous functions silently fall back to synchronous memcpys in all cases when the stricter parameter validation failed.",1334788158

3860561,comment,3860060,3860060,8,0,bevan,,,"I worked on UCT-based (one-arm bandit algorithm) go players for 3 semesters. It was truly a great, if often frustrating, experience.<p>It's a tough problem to get your head around. Sure, the premise makes sense- that the Monte Carlo heuristic plus the UCT tree-exploration algorithm balances promising nodes with uncertain ones to intelligently expand the tree. But tweaking that algorithm usually hurt performance more than helped, and the tweaks that did improve gameplay were non-intuitive.<p>One semester our goal was to improve the random-playout generator to play slightly more human-like games. It turns out that almost any play enhancements made in the Monte Carlo simulator crippled performance (for instance: instead of playing randomly, search the board for an opportunity to capture the opponent). The best result we had was achieved by applying the capture-if-possible heuristic on only two positions per random move (ex: at the beginning of the MC-simulator's move, pick two positions randomly- if moving in either one captures the opponent, do it). Applying that heuristic on any more than 2 positions per move made the random games play out more slowly than it was worth. Needless to say, a lot of time was spent testing our tweaks (which itself was quite time consuming).<p>It was frustrating to see our initial seemingly sensible tweaks cripple performance, and it definitely took some time to calibrate ourselves to the problem at hand. But I probably learned more about programming while working on Go than in any other 3-semester span.<p>Peter Drake's Orego player is a great starting point for exploring the UCT algorithm (Peter Drake wrote a popular Java textbook you may have used in undergrad).

I'm not putting you in this category since you clearly state you don't believe the United States is in a liquidity trap and that removes any unambiguous point of contention between you and Keynes as far as I can tell, but I also don't think your critique is necessarily on-topic since you seem to have something against Keynesianism and I can't tell why: Keynes never advocates inflation and doesn't advocate subsidizing bankers.

3860519,comment,3859562,3859562,3,0,liber8,,,"It's interesting to think about what <i>intelligence</i> really means.  In some ways, this has been frequently discussed (ie multiple types of intelligence) and in other ways it seems that this has never been discussed (ie what are we actually talking about when we call someone intelligent?) Is intelligence the ability to learn something quickly?  Is it the ability to understand something quickly?  Is it the ability to solve a particular type of problem quickly?<p>Depending on what we mean, ""Can you make yourself smarter?"" has fairly obvious answers.<p>Start by looking at children.  In one regard, we rarely learn faster than when we are kids.  Everything is foreign to us, and we are constantly learning, our brains little sponges in a wet world.  But clearly, our 25-year old selves could solve far more complex problems than our 6-year old selves.  Did we get smarter between 6 and 25?<p>In the same vein, think about how severely retarded people are described: ""He has the mind of a 4 year old.""  Whether that description is medically accurate or not isn't the point.  We certainly think of children as intellectually inferior, even though all of our brains started out that way.<p>So what changed?  Why is a 25 year old ""more intelligent"" than a 6 year old?  Is it the creation of new neural pathways?  Is it simply the way they've learned to look at the world or quickly apply answers and processes they already know to fit new problems?<p>Maybe you can provide more answers?  Because it seems to me that the fact that we got to where we are today indicates that you can absolutely make yourself more intelligent, depending on how you define that.

Just as you could mock out a call to S3API.get(object_id) and have it returns my_object, you could write a server that responds to the S3 API call for getting object_id.<p>The long answer is that using mocks is a lot quicker to develop, easier, more straight forward and has faster run time than maintaining a real runnable copy of S3 that behaves the exact same as the real S3.  With the fake S3 you're still spending CPU cycles inside your S3 client while it talks HTTP with your fake S3, which slows unit tests down a lot.  Plus fake S3 may have slightly different behavior when your S3API library interacts with it, which could lead to really hard to track down bugs later on.

Chess feels more like a set of arbitrary pieces of knowledge.<p>- The handicap system in Go is an objectively awesome way to have players of different strengths play competitively.

In Go, if you give someone four stones, it feels like you're still playing Go.<p>- When watching strong players, I like the fact that there aren't draws in Go.  It makes the game dramatic until the end.<p>- I like chess problems better than Go problems, and I personally find a level of beauty and variety in amazing chess brilliancies which surpasses what I perceive in great Go moves.

If money can be found for it,  a sample return mission to a near earth asteroid could probably be accomplished SpaceX-style.<p>A key step in all of this could be the mining of water from the asteroid Ceres,  which is a much more practical destination than mars.  At that point you could set up a solar or nuclear powered water cracking factory that would make large amounts of fuel available.  Any needs for water in space could be so satisfied.",1334786530

It's not like the company can look at what you are doing hour to hour and negotiate some random hourly amount that changes every hour.<p>Besides, hourly wage really doesn't make any sense for most jobs and certainly not software engineering. If someone works for 5 hours a day and gets more as much done as someone working 10 why would they get paid less? You could do some backwards math and come up with some hourly wage for the 5 hour guy but that's really just putting the cart before the horse.",1334786526

They don't actually talk about buildpacks all that much but I see it as the major differentiating feature on Heroku.<p>One thing you may be interested in is heroku-buildpack-multi[1] which lets you run multiple buildpacks. You could theoretically use this to include the standard Python and Node.js buildpacks plus a small custom one that just installs and runs Brunch.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi</a>",1334786522

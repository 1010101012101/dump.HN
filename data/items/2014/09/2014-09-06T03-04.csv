As the article states, Amazon&#x27;s <i>gross</i> profit is over 20%. And the article briefly hints that gross profit is not a very useful metric. It&#x27;s certainly of little immediate relevance to Amazon&#x27;s investors.",1409975932

Lots of lobby dollars in play reinforcing that, and there is the strong perception that Oregon can&#x27;t actually afford to make any kind of investment.<p>But this shows Oregon can, did, and it was botched horribly.  Doing the same while providing local jobs, some great skills to be used all over the place, and build something that has a very likely lower overall ownership cost profile makes a ton of sense!<p>It just won&#x27;t get proposed in the current political climate, which was the point of my reply.<p>Of course Oregon wants COTS.  Everybody does, because they think the vendor will own it, saving them money through economies of scale.  Quite frequently, COTS can do that, but for something like this, something new, that needs to communicate with a lot of varied systems?<p>No way in hell it was ever gonna be COTS, and that right there should have triggered a much different, &quot;how does Oregon do this?&quot; kind of discussion.<p>Oracle has a good sales team, and they sold it right to this dynamic, which is what they were supposed to do.  Problem is the value really wasn&#x27;t there.  No matter what, it was going to take some real work to build out the exchange and have it function well.<p>As for the support contracts, those come with an annual cost.  It&#x27;s very highly likely that cost could simply provide a job for the people who built the thing.  Additionally, having seen success on a project like that, the same team would be well positioned to build out more and or get funded by other municipalities seeking similar solutions.<p>I don&#x27;t have the basic numbers a few of us ran back then, but they were compelling.<p>This works the same for States as it does companies or anyone else.  Make the in-house investments and own the tools.  From there, buying help is always an option.  Avoiding it is another option.  Relying on a vendor, who will very frequently oversell their support staff, counting on their product to be a winner, often results in that support contract merely funding the trouble shooting.  More dollars are required to buy, implement, test, etc... fixes.<p>Fixes, which by the way, will be called custom patches for major customers due to the size and non COTS nature.",1409975624

The gist is that the Scala collections have too many dimensions (mutable/immutable, sequential/parallel, strict/lazy), all of which share code -- but it turns out that the right implementation for a lazy immutable parallel collection is not necessarily good for a strict mutable sequential collection, and juggling all these variations makes it much trickier to modify or reason about the code. He seems to be fine with the existence of parallel collections, but probably as something that lives on top of the standard library instead of being layered into it.<p>To your second paragraph -- I believe that #2 might have found its way into a Scala-from-scratch, but the others certainly wouldn&#x27;t.

Put it behind a gateway that acts as an isolating proxy.<p>While this is good advice and will help you in the event of your server accidentally leaking debugging/config information, it won&#x27;t help if someone is able to get the hidden service to make a network request. For example, if they can get it to send an email or check if a page is online, then that email will obviously go through the gateway. And obviously if someone gains arbitrary code execution, they can just Google &quot;my IP&quot; and see the externally facing IP.<p>Some other useful advice: if you&#x27;re setting up a Tor hidden service, make sure the HTTP server only accepts requests from the Tor network. The FBI claims that when they put the $_SERVER[&#x27;SERVER_ADDR&#x27;] IP in their browser they got the SR home page right on port 80, which is extremely poor security on SR&#x27;s part.

For example, blasting at mines on occasion resulted in people many miles away getting hit with high speed pebbles that hurt them. The miners are liable for damages even if they took careful measures to reduce risk. There is zero reason to alter this concept for cars, trucks, or trains. If you want to speed around in two tons of steel because that&#x27;s easier for you, then you should be fully liable for any consequences that flow from speeding around in two tons of steel. Trying to walk across the street is not an activity that creates the risk in the first place.",1409974413

I mean, the amount of space required per driver is wildly disproportionate with the demand on a public resource that every other form of transportation requires. Then there are the environmental costs, which include both noise and pollution. Again, these are way out of proportion in terms of the number of drivers vs. non drivers. They also do damage to commerce, in that pedestrian friendly zones are far more amenable to shopping, dining, etc. than streets that give preference to the needs of drivers.

This even applies to generally lower-importance scenarios such as watching YouTube and Netflix videos.<p>ISPs are of special importance, because the exposures can be concentrated.  We make use of end-to-end encryption with specific servers in order to reduce the information that ISPs (and others) acquire.  How will we hide interest data from ISPs in an NPN world?",1409972748

8277338,comment,8276920,8277265,2,0,ggupta,,,"You&#x27;re conflating cash with assets. None of the companies you mentioned are trading at a discount to their cash balance.<p>Institutional investors don&#x27;t value tech companies based on tangible book - they use P/E or EV / EBITDA multiples (or FCF multiples for software companies). The only companies that trade on net asset value (NAV) are financial companies such as banks. For those companies, the balance sheet structure is the opposite of traditional companies - assets such as cash represent liabilities (they&#x27;re funds individuals have deposited in their account). As a result, the NAV framework is inappropriate to apply to tech companies.<p>Two specific points on the above examples:<p>(1) Cable companies are valued using a different investment framework. They are highly capital intensive businesses, where cash today does not reflect cyclical future capital expenditures. Furthermore, these businesses have a tremendous amount of leverage, and thus you have to look at net cash balances, not gross cash.<p>(2) Your Apple example is absolutely correct. This actually happened when Microsoft announced a special one-time dividend in 2004. This goes back to my 3rd point above - when companies hoard a significant cash balance without any plans for capital returns, investors start to discount the cash. This was Icahn&#x27;s thesis when he went activist on Apple. However, I would caution against extrapolating this to companies that don&#x27;t have significant cash balances.<p>I know it sounds tempting to say that cash doesn&#x27;t generate great returns and is thus logically undervalued. There are two reasons why that&#x27;s not the case.<p>(1) Investors usually use EV / EBITDA multiples to arrive at an enterprise value. EBITDA is prior to the recognition of interest expense / income - the earnings generation of cash does not matter here at all. After arriving at the EV, they then add cash and subtract debt (at a 1:1 value) to arrive at the equity value, and then divide by shares outstanding to arrive at the target price.<p>(2) Investors that use P/E multiples need to normalize for variations in cash balances by using ex-cash P/E multiples. For most companies, cash is a small percentage of the market cap such that P/E multiples are a close enough approximation to ex-cash P/E multiples. For companies with large cash balances, that&#x27;s not the case, and the valuation method needs to be adjusted appropriately.<p>If your argument is that some investors fail to do this, you&#x27;re absolutely right. However, they are doing so based on an error of judgement - not because they really believe cash shouldn&#x27;t be valued on a 1:1 basis.",1409972466

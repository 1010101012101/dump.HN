Google+ was (and still is) a pretty cool platform. It has a lot of neat features that existing social networks lack. Facebook just somehow holds on to their userbase -- probably due to familiarity and complacency -- and Google just can&#x27;t disrupt that.<p>Facebook has turned into a pretty strange place compared to its early years. I don&#x27;t see much but &#x27;news&#x27; posts, spammy pictures/articles, and clickbait (&quot;DOCTORS HATE HIM, CLICK TO SEE WHY!&quot;).<p>Other platforms are much better for connecting with friends and colleagues, but no one is leaving Facebook.

9919660,comment,9918615,9918615,0,0,erbo,,,"Gene Kranz, in his book <i>Failure Is Not An Option,</i> describes one of the simulator runs for Apollo 11 in which the Simsup (simulation supervisor) threw a 1201 alarm at the Mission Control team.  The controller receiving the alarm panicked and called for an abort, and Kranz passed the abort order on to CAPCOM. Afterwards, the Simsup told Kranz, &quot;This was not an abort. You should have continued the landing...You violated the fundamental rule of Mission Control: You must have two cues before aborting. You called for an abort with only one!&quot;<p>The controller dug more thoroughly into program alarm codes after that simulation, and wrote a new mission rule specifying a series of program alarm codes for which an abort would be called. 1201 and 1202 were <i>not</i> among those alarm codes.  Thus, when the 1202 showed up during the actual descent, the controller was able to say, &quot;We&#x27;re Go on that alarm,&quot; and when the 1201 happened shortly thereafter, he could say, &quot;It&#x27;s a Go--same type--we&#x27;re still Go.&quot;  Shortly thereafter, history was made...not just because the MIT programmers had done their job well, but because the flight control team in Houston had also done their job well.",1437433136

Am I going to listen to a podiatrist?) - this is somewhat different.<p>When Call9 has a private transport arranged by the ambulance service, whose medical license do the EMTs and paramedics operate under? The county/hospital associated therewith? The ambulance service? Your physicians? And depending on the answer to that, what does the County MD have to say about that? Or the DOH EMS section for that matter?<p>If your ambulance service&#x27;s EMS personnel are operating under county auspices, and that county has a medical protocol, how does that mesh in with instructions from your physician? What happens if your physician&#x27;s instructions differ from the county protocol?<p>Because that could and will be an issue. An instruction from your physician could lead to a paramedic losing their job (and has happened, when physicians have instructed the on-scene medic to do procedure X when the paramedic is not authorized to do so).

With Call9, EMTs can begin work right away upon arrival.&quot;<p>This is, as someone else noted, a very hand wavy, dismissive and inaccurate description. You have access to patient history from facilities, and that is a fantastic resource.<p>But to say that when I roll up on scene that all I know is &quot;Go to address X for sick person&quot; is not remotely true.<p>&quot;You&#x27;ll be seeing a 65 year old male with sudden onset left arm numbness, shortness of breath, shoulder pain with no known cause, and no relief.

After the initial tones to get the units rolling, whilst the call receiver continues to gather more information, the dispatcher is preparing a short report to give more detailed information to the responding units.",1437433125

9919632,comment,9916585,9916882,0,0,tracker1,,,"To me it seems like a lot of extra cognitive overhead, though if you are using VS it may or may not be worth it.  I&#x27;ve been using babeljs and traceur before that for transpiling combined with browserify.  You can get a similar experience with more extras with webpack.<p>To me, simply being able to break up methods into discrete testable modules, then composing those methods into either workflows or structured utilities, you don&#x27;t need the cognitive overhead of strict typing nearly as much.  Unfortunately, going that route takes discipline.<p>What typescript and es6 tends to bring is cleaner class syntax, which imho is a detriment to the use of JS in most cases.  People tend to put things into classes that really don&#x27;t need to be.  You data structures can be plain objects instantiated as needed (generally via JSON passing), and most of your workflow logic can again be a module that is an object which returns a composite of discrete, or at least bound/wrapped functions that themselves are independent and testable.<p>One thing you should probably strive for in a green project where there is a lot of JS, and multiple developers is 100% test coverage for JS.  If you are having serious issues with being able to test your code, odds are your structure needs to be cleaned up.  With utilities like sinon and proxyquire you should be able to shim for testing anything a method needs to be exercised.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that test coverage doesn&#x27;t guarantee good code, it only ensures that you&#x27;ve looked at every piece of code a couple of times.  It&#x27;s that forced review/refactor for testing that gets you thinking in terms of usability.  Filling out an existing software with unit tests without refactoring as you go, only gives you some protection against regressions.<p>I have totally lost track of where I was going... I guess it just comes down to that, for me, TS brings the limitations in terms of testing that exist in Java and .Net and force them on JS.  JS is inherently more easily testable than many other languages.",1437432762

This is different than a consult where a doctor can only virtually advise, but cannot intervene; it is also different that calling a doctor for a specialty consult or a second opinion.<p>It is true that putting a doctor first in the process adds another step before calling 911.  But it is a meaningful interaction that improves the quality and efficiency of the medical care (both by having an ER doctor assess the patient, and by having information ready so that the 911 call can go faster).

To make this feasible for me, I think AirBnb would need several things:<p>* Some sort of loyalty program with PERSONAL benefits to me - this would best manifest itself as a credit in my personal account<p>* Status - SPG Platinum greatly enhanced my traveling experience with perks such as recognition on check-in, upgrades, gift baskets, etc. I didn&#x27;t care about most of this, but AirBnb could certainly implement aspects such as &quot;upgrades&quot; to nicer/bigger properties which are vacant within an x-block radius, gift baskets (delivered by the likes of Postmates, UberEATS, etc.), local events, etc.<p>* Instant booking - this is HUGE. I very very often would book hotels past 6pm on the night of, or move/cancel stays based on work, airline schedules, etc. I don&#x27;t want to wait to interact with a host - I just want a key.<p>* Amenities - Fast WiFi is a must, outlets by the bed are nice, and very important - gym access. No reason why AirBnb couldn&#x27;t come up with an arrangement with e.g. 24 Hour Fitness to provide access passes to guests<p>* Room service - Partnership with Postmates/Caviar/DoorDash/etc. to bill directly to room, along with a preview of what&#x27;s available<p>* Personal concierge - ala SPG Ambassador<p>* Perhaps most crucial to this list, is a concern for the employer, not me - the reason Amex/Concur have a duopoly over the enterprise travel market is not because of their partnerships or UI - it&#x27;s because they offer integration with HR systems for things like emergency alerts (e.g there&#x27;s been a terrorist attack in NYC - I need to know which of my employees are staying in a hotel near xxx). AirBnb should already be in talks with Workday/Zenefits/ZenPayroll and the likes to figure this out for tech startups - most likely to be early adopters.<p>AirBnb has a potenitally superior product as compared to SPG,Hyatt,etc. and a better interface than Amex/Hipmunk/Concur/Orbitz for Business. But corp travel is complicated, and customers are extremely finicky. Huge potential to get this right, huge opportunity if they do.",1437432205

Or does it?&quot;  &quot;Catchy Phrase&quot; tells the story of an single data point, or maybe three, with edge-of-your-seat tension provided by a jumbled chronology.  It opens a generation before the main data point was born, then skips to the present day, before jumping into the middle of a tangential story.  Then it&#x27;s back to where we left the origin story of the data point, but this time we&#x27;re in a different location looking at the second data point.  Next comes some speculation about a possible rosy future and maybe a motivating example.  Next we end the tangential story, which introduces the third data point, at it&#x27;s funeral.  The tangential story begins.  As you read, you can see a complex theme slowly but deftly woven from the timelines of the several stories.

I&#x27;ve earned/burned about the same volume of points as you and can attest that this hobby is awesome, with some caveats.<p>For the beginners out there:<p>1. Be sure to read as much about earning miles as redeeming them.  Both sides are equally important and redeeming is actually getting much more difficult.<p>2. Don&#x27;t let the newbie blogs lure you into hitting credit cards too hard.  Banks are starting to tighten the clamps on our hobby.  Be sure to learn, start slow, and then start ramping up.  Banks like to see a relationship, not just a high credit score.<p>3. If you&#x27;re dipping your toe in Manufactured Spending (MS), start small then ramp up over time.  Nothing worse than getting shut down for hitting something too hard. That said, MS is a great way to meet minimum spending without using too much money.<p>4. Don&#x27;t let headline point valuations fool you into thinking you have to fly in Biz or First to get a good value on your points.  Blogs use these kinds of numbers mostly to get you to sign up for CC&#x27;s.  Figure out your your strategy and go that way.  A person looking for a lot of domestic flights is going to have a different strategy than someone looking to travel like saryant (and myself, incidentally).<p>tl;dr; This hobby is amazing if you can figure it out and do the leg work.

I highly recommend the practice as it has been very illuminating to me since I started a few months ago. Reviewing my previous readings allows me to ascertain how much math I actually end up retaining from my study sessions, and keeping all of my work in one place (as opposed to throwaway scrap paper) allows me to spot any particularly common mistakes.<p>So far, I&#x27;ve found that my memory is far more tenuous than I had previously assumed. I&#x27;d look at last month&#x27;s entries and realize that I&#x27;d only retained 20% of what I had learned; fine details being especially prone to slippage. Yet from analyzing my mistakes, I&#x27;ve also found that those very details are much more crucial than I had thought.<p>The result of all of this is that I&#x27;ve started to shift my focus from &quot;learning new math rapidly&quot; to &quot;winning the uphill battle against memory loss.&quot; From this new perspective, the old adage: &quot;the only way to learn mathematics is through doing&quot; begins to make a lot more sense. While active learning is far from any cure to forgetfulness, given my own mnemonic capabilities I have come to see that it would probably be a better long-term investment to spend a month on fully working and understanding a chapter, than to spend the same time blazing through several chapters but skipping the exercises (having done both.)<p>I emphasize again that this is my own conclusion based on my own characteristics, and that is precisely why I recommend everyone to find their own answer to this question by keeping their own math notebook.",1437431197

When I tested #5 (500 x 477), the viewport disappears off the end of the right edge of my screen. I can&#x27;t see the whole thing at once, no matter what I do. I have to scroll, and that&#x27;s confusing because my scroll swipe will move the content inside the viewport before moving the site itself, and thus the viewport itself. If I could pinch out on it, I&#x27;d see the whole thing at once.<p>As an aside, the Android I used to test this allowed me to turn on Force Zoom, and that allowed me to use the site better.<p>The second site (grid.html) can appear very small. I think you intended to say it <i>should</i> be zoomable, as I was able to zoom in and out on that one.<p>My point is, even when you yourself cannot conceive of a reason a user would like to zoom the site, trust me, there probably is one. In another reply, you mentioned the 300ms delay that turning on zoom control introduces. I hadn&#x27;t thought of that before, and that is a good point for disabling zoom control. Maybe Apple can follow Google&#x27;s lead, and give their users the option to override it.

There are _plenty_ of safe districts looking for experienced officers, and there&#x27;s almost no reason why an officer has to keep working in West Baltimore aside from pride.<p>They can very easily jump to another richer district, one with fewer murders and higher-educated populace.

There&#x27;s a freaking enormous downside for large corporations, and that&#x27;s their inability to centrally manage vendor relationships with large chains.  For example, my company spends about 2500 nights/yr here: <a href=""http://www.itchotels.in/hotels/itcgrandchola.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itchotels.in/hotels/itcgrandchola.aspx</a><p>As a result, we were able to negotiate a rate down from about 12,000INR/night to about 6500INR/night.  The hotel is huge, has every amenity (in India, especially if you&#x27;re flying solo, most business travelers are not likely to venture outside the hotel for dinner), is close to the office, and we&#x27;re only paying about US$100/night.<p>I think Manhattan may be one of the few cities where this legitimately makes sense (due to general lack of hotels, or price gouging).  SF, perhaps, but it depends where you&#x27;re going to be for work and whether there are any huge conferences going on at the same time.  One year at Dreamforce I booked late and ended up in a shared room at a craptastic rundown place near the Embarcadero.  Perhaps not typical, but it does happen.",1437429770

309061,comment,307722,308122,0,0,thwarted,,,"Well, sure, but when you're talking about regular expressions and don't give them a context (which you did in your PHP example above), you should be using regular expression escaping syntax, not one that is based on a context that isn't mentioned.  PCRE are the same no matter which language or application uses the library, how the language serializes and represents regular expression literals is an aspect of the language, not of the regular expression engine.<p>Oddly, it's really unintuitive to specify a character class as you have above that is composed of the backslash and the w character in PHP.  The PHP single quoted string '\\w' and '\w' are exactly the same, and end up being the same to the regular expression engine.  If you want to put a backslash in your regular expression, you need to quadruple it.",1221810441

309053,comment,308332,308332,0,0,gruseom,,,"Such a respectful reply. To judge by his writing, Weinreb is a genuinely nice man. I'm glad that he has taken on a (semi-) public role as Lisp advocate.<p>I'm a recent (last 3 years) adopter of Common Lisp who works in it every day. To me Lisp is hardly a failure, it's a secret weapon. For example, a couple of weeks ago I had occasion to take a complex chunk of CL code and make it compile into Javascript as well (I need it to run both on the server and in the browser, under different circumstances). The point isn't that I <i>needed</i>, say, Lisp macros to do this. The point is that I was able to do it pretty <i>easily</i>. As a working programmer, I'm surprised by how often something that feels like it'll be scary and hard turns out to be pretty easy in CL. In fact I often spend more time worrying about it than I do coding it (which makes me wonder how long it will take before certain habits that come from experience in less productive environments die off).<p>This isn't the sort of thing you can really analyze on the level of language features. I find that a lot of the discourse around language comparison is the activity of researchers and hobbyists (for want of a better term) who aren't immediately concerned with building major systems. They like to explore many different things and the programming tasks they take on tend to be conducive to that - coding exercises and such. That's great, but not the same perspective as when you throw yourself into making one big system over months or years. To the first sort of person, the various Lisps and startup annoyances and incompatibilities constitute a huge barrier, enough to say ""why bother"" and move on. To me they were an investment that paid off relatively quickly and has since produced big gains. (I mean technically. We'll see if they cross over economically.)<p>Lisp isn't going to have a major resurgence on language grounds alone. It's too old for that, and too suboptimal for blog posts. What would, though, make a big difference is seeing more successful products made with it. That may sound odd as there have been few so far, but that's where I think the untapped potential of Lisp is. And if that ever happens, an ecosystem might develop that has fewer of the dysfunctional aspects of the past. Successful companies that use Lisp would fund open source development, and so on.",1221809201

Multi version concurrency control (i.e. writers not blocking readers) is old hat in the db field.  Prior to 05, you just liberally sprinkled (nolock) on your selects and accepted that you may get a dirty read but that it was better than the db falling over with over aggressive locking.",1219710167

286607,comment,286512,286512,0,0,time_management,,,"I'll admit that I know nothing about PHP, but please tell me it is a mistake in the design table that they have ""foo"" == 0. Otherwise, we have this rather disturbing* non-transitivity of (==):<p>true == ""foo"" == 0 == false<p>I also generally dislike the idea of having certain values being treated as ""false"", e.g. 0 is false but 2.2e-16 is true... or ""a"" and ""1"" are true but ""0"" is false. It just seems to be clumsy, and not very robust. It reminds me of the ""and-or trick"" in Python, which busts if you aren't familiar with the fact that values such as 0/0.0 are false.<p>* Actually, on review, it's obvious that some non-transitivity is desirable by design, in the sense that 1 and 2 are both ""true"" but we don't want 1 == 2, even though 1 == true and 2== true. However, I still maintain that the chain I have above represents bad design.",1219709557

286602,comment,286045,286513,0,0,KiwiNige,,,"SQL server now has row versioning like Oracle, so that writes won't block reads, and you don't have to read dirty data (you just read data how it was before the write started). I think this is not turned on by default because it has a performance hit.
Also I can't remember if it's new to 2005 or 2008 versions and can't be bothered to look it up.",1219709078

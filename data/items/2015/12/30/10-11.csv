This why other IP protections (like patents) exist, to cover works whose form does not match those covered by copyright.<p>But a web API is not a protocol and a communication protocol is not what is used to call Google Maps, beeminder or other web applications.<p>> Yes, but that was the point. Google made some arguments that they believed would make APIs non-copyrightable. The court ruled that those arguments are fair-use arguments which are not relevant to the question of copyrightability, but may be used as a defense once APIs are copyrighted.<p>NO, the appeal ruling had nothing to do with Google arguments about fair use. If there is a new trial to rule about the fair use is because in the original trial, the ruling about fair use was stalled by the jury and Judge Alsup stated that API&#x27;s can&#x27;t be copyrighted. And the Appeal court didn&#x27;t wanted to rule about fair use<p>> Quite the opposite. It is the copyright holder who has to sue you.<p>Yes, but fair use is not automatically granted, so, you&#x27;re in danger to be sued by the copyright holder. Microsoft can sue WINE developers or Amazon can sue anyone developing a clone of the AWS API.",1451472806

Most devices simply cannot use less energy, or can be used in the night. Do you want that your washing machine starts in a room above you in the middle of the night? How will the shirts look like in the next morning? Is it funny to use the loud vacuum cleaner for 2 hours, whereas your older model had more power and you had finished your work in 1 hour? Also a recent news article highlighted that several companies from Germany (and likely other countries) like Siemens, Bosch, Miele are cheating with the energy certificate tests of household devices - exactly like VW/Bosch with Volkswagen cars. If you set a modern Miele washing machine to 60 degree Celsius it splash your shirts for a few seconds with 58 degree water (the period of the EU tests) and then use colder water (below 40 degree) for the remaining wash cycle. So they cheat to achieve the tests and consumers buy such devices. So a recent &quot;smart device&quot; device is often a bad investment (and sometime it even cheats on you) - there are only a few exceptions. And one is better of if it is build of open source components.",1451472482

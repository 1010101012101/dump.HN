8118771,comment,8118294,8118616,1,0,_delirium,,,"A common approach is to incorporate a municipally owned subsidiary that hires the appropriate expertise. That&#x27;s how the electric and plumbing networks were built in many towns, for example. A number have since been sold off (turned into privatized utility companies), but some are still city-owned. Other cities have gone for a pooled model, where the each city owns their utilities, but rather than administer them directly, pays into a nonprofit organization that provides the service/maintenance, thereby gaining some economy of scale (e.g. <a href=""http://www.ncpublicpower.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncpublicpower.com</a>).",1406879980

Our multitude of beliefs about it do not change there being or not life our death, just as our very existence is not a matter of belief. We are or we&#x27;re not. Just because we have epistemic limitations, that doesn&#x27;t mean that the ontology of life, before and after death, is influenced by that, or is an illusion.<p>I hope you&#x27;d agree with me when I say that love is more natural to human beings than fear. That peace is more desirable than troubling. I believe that no matter what religion or belief system one&#x27;s in at the time, for whatever reasons, seeking love and peace and cultivating them among people around, will set them on the right path. Anything else is like me, a simple worker, saying to another one that he&#x27;ll be fired because he done whatever. It&#x27;s not my decision, although I can have that belief.

Do you leave it in your home (not locked in a safe)? More nightmarish... violence and threats can be applied to individuals with relatively low risk.<p>Data held on individual responsibility is not secure. To secure it you need an auditable monitored secured database at an alarmed secured location.<p>Now, bad men may still be able to get at data held by organizations or communes (as sysadmins and security guards are just as worried about car bombs as you and me), but it becomes risky in the way that nabbing someone, extracting their passwords, copying their data, shooting them and burning down their house is not. This is why individuals have long chosen to deposit valuables with trusted third parties rather than keeping it under their beds despite the marginal cost of doing so.<p>Excel spreadsheets are fundamentally hard to debug, in the sense of understanding the organization of the code is very hard (see GOTO considered harmful), this normally doesn&#x27;t impact people because spreadsheets tend to be relatively simple, but the problem is that as they become useful and important they tend to become heavily used and more and more complex.<p>[[EDIT - I just reread this and realized I wrote it as a first person/personal set of statements, and I had no intention of aiming it at any person (especially not the parent author) and so I rewrote it to be impersonal and hopefully not inflammatory or unpleasant]].",1406879062

I&#x27;ve not seen any oddities in IPN for a few years, and can confirm notifications have gone through over the past few days.<p>It&#x27;s important to be careful about jumping to drastic conclusions when debugging a connection like this.<p>E.g., from the OP:<p>> I called Paypal Technical Support to verify exactly what we were seeing. Sure enough, they had received other calls today about this exact issue. Other vendors were not receiving IPNs for their orders. The ticket for this &quot;critical bug&quot; was created today.<p>> The problem with that fact is that our customer&#x27;s order was from 9 days ago. For at least 9 days (we are going through all of our partial orders now to see the full extent of this bug), Paypal was not sending IPNs to merchants and did not know.<p>This doesn&#x27;t actually follow logically.  The tech support rep mentioned getting other calls about IPNs not going through does <i>not</i> mean NO other IPNs were going through.  Likewise, if Tindie has actually not gotten any IPNs for 9 days, that doesn&#x27;t indicate anything about the other millions of PayPal merchants.<p>This reminds me a bit of customers who call in a panic that &quot;your entire website is broken!&quot;, and after a bit of discussion it becomes clear that their internet connection is down.<p>The same stream of events could be caused by lots of things, including minor configuration changes on Tindie&#x27;s end.",1406879040

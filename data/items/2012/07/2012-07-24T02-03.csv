        <div>
            <div><p>Hello World<p></div>
        </div>
    </div><p>Then yeah sure it's not semantic because you have two unnecessary divs holding a paragraph, but if it was just the one div holding a paragraph tag it would be perfectly acceptable in HTML 4.x onwards. The only cases I can see a div being non semantic are the silly example I gave above, self closing divs in HTML (not extensible) and empty divs.",1343098632

4284127,comment,4283896,4284074,5,0,brianfryer,,,"> How on earth are div's non-semantic? Most things on a page are just ""boxes"" -- not lists or links or images or paragraphs, just boxes. And div's are the correct thing to use in this case.<p>Because most things on a page are not ""just boxes"". <header>, <article>, and <footer> are not ""boxes"" -- they have semantic meaning.<p>> Also, ""class soup"" is a proper CSS programming practice in many people's opinion -- many CSS style guides explicitly state that it's preferable to use descriptive class names in CSS rules, rathen than element names.<p>Everyone is welcome to their own opinion, but I'm of the persuasion that the fewer CSS rules the better. Not only does fewer CSS rules mean that there are fewer things to remember when styling a page, it also means a smaller file is requested.<p>It's better to use HTML like this...<p><article>
<hgroup>
<h1>Page title</h1>
<h4>Written by so-and-so in such-and-such categories.</h4>
</hgroup>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</article><p>... than like this ...<p><div class=""content"">
<h1 class=""page-title"">Page title</h1>
<div class=""meta-data"">Written by so-and-so in such-and-such categories.</div>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div><p>There is so much more <i>semantic</i> meaning in the former bit, than the latter.<p>Too, semantic HTML can help with SEO.<p>> Mainly because, as a site evolves, changing a single element name might break your entire CSS rule structure, while basing your CSS on class names makes everything much more robust and maintainable.<p>No need to argue with that. Building web apps is a whole other animal, and (having used Bootstrap) I can see why using lots of classes could be beneficial in certain situations.<p>However, I am still of the opinion that semantic HTML > ""class soup"".<p>Edit: I accidentally a word.",1343098471

4284119,comment,4281722,4283934,5,0,kristopolous,,,"Many after-market and non-luxury cars can fall victim to a replay attack. More expensive vehicles use something called a rolling code, here's an example chip: <a href=""http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21143b.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/21143b.pdf</a> and <a href=""http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2600.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atmel.com/Images/doc2600.pdf</a><p>Just to be perfectly clear, what you have is a synchronized incrementing number usually using some in-house block-cipher with a 2^16 period. When the car receives a PRN from the RKE, it checks the locality of its current sequence (usually about 2^8) and then if the PRN matches one of them, you are in. So if you have the 2^16 sequence, just skip over every 2^8 and see if it unlocks. That's 2^8 tries; under a second.<p>If you don't have that, with a few sequences you can deduce the key pretty easily; each PRN is 32 bits; providing you up to 32 bits of information.<p>Since the payload is an incrementing 16 bit number you have probably 3 bits of entropy on the 32 bits (8 PKE commands between your sniffing).  Anyway, assume you have 29 bits from the 32. You also have to toss the 16 bit sequence on the 64 bit source key calculations since it is effectively a salt.<p>Therefore, you can conservatively get the magic 64-bit key in 6 transmissions assuming there are no sequence collisions of that length. And even if there are, the solution space of the collisions would be quite modest.<p>Since each transmission has a plaintext serial associated with it (usually a subset of the VIN ... available on the windshield and all), you are not at a loss as to which transmission is which car.<p>So install your sniffer in an office-building parking structure on Monday, assume codes before 1100 are locks, after 1400 are unlocks, and you are in the car of your choosing by Thursday.<p>Pretend you don't have this. Pretend you want to do brute force on the 32 bit key-space. There's something called guard time. The idea is that there's a backoff period before another code can be tried. That's usually about a millisecond or two; if at all.<p>The transmission of the payload is on the order of tens of microseconds.<p>So generally speaking you can presume that you can do about 1.5m keys an hour.<p>Now let's say you are a car thief and you go to a lot of new cars ... there's 64 of them (2^6) just to make our lives easy. You have a wonderful consequence of the birthday-problem.<p>A 2^32 key space with a 2^8 tolerance over 2^6 vehicles ... means (32 - 8 - 6) = 2^18 keys until you should have a match.<p>Now let's see, you can generate about 2^21 keys per hour ... oopsie daisy. Look what we just did ... Your mean time to unlock one of the cars passes a 50% threshold in all of 4 minutes.<p>And that's the naive approach, without doing any predictive plaintext attack.<p>Now let's assume you use both methods together. We aren't talking about much waiting time here.<p>So I mean yes, the rolling code means you can't just do a replay. Ok, fine ... right ... you have to do a napkin full of math and a little programming.  It's not real security.",1343098296

(I know that factoid because he wrote a component which makes my business possible and I give him a sale a month as a donation -- which is the exact opposite of generous and I <i>know</i> that and yet I somehow can't justify ever doing more.)<p>Making a living on Gittip is an implementation detail, not the goal itself, unless I'm greatly mistaken as to your internal calculus.  Your goal is to make a living writing code with some X-factor about freedom or project selection, right?  There are far better ways to do this.  For example, you're currently looking for 50 hours a month of contracting or $2k of donations.  This (and gittip) strongly, strongly suggest that you're undercharging for contracting, probably by a factor of 2x to 5x or higher.  You can make a huge impact on your standard of living and job satisfaction just by raising rates, and the execution risk of that strategy is absurdly easier than hoping you hit the multiple independent dominoes you need to do to make the gittip plan work.<p>There are other product offerings you could make as an OSS dev which would complement your desired lifestyle and be orders of magnitude more efficient that gittip.  One such product offering is online training material, such as e-books, screencasts, etc.  $2k a month is 40 copies of a $50 ebook, which is very achievable.

Everything sensible and necessary is fully covered, with copays never being anything more than nominal.  <i>Everything</i>: medical, dental, optical, disability, family, all of it.<p>* Amazon requires longer hours and offers less vacation and holiday time than both Microsoft and Google.  As a nice touch from my MS offer at the time, they offer 3 ""floating holidays"".  These expire every year instead of accruing like vacation days, but they are usable more-or-less whenever for the purpose of accounting for cultural/religious occasions (Eid, Rosh ha'Shanah, Tanabata, Easter, Denali, whatever).<p>* Amazon and MS both have cafeterias, but make you pay.  MS has free drinks, though, and Google has free... everything.<p>* Amazon offers higher salaries and attracts money-grubbers.  MS offers lower salaries but better benefits.  Google is more selective about hiring but offers higher salaries <i>and</i> better benefits.<p>* Amazon requires almost every engineer to spend at least a month per year doing 24/7 on-call support.

I got 2 job offers out of maybe a round dozen firms, though these two offers were from Amazon and Microsoft.  I got to a sight interview with Google, but got rejected.  Overall, did good but not great.  Didn't even get to meet start-up folks, because most start-ups are in San Francisco and what start-ups exist in Boston, even funded ones, fall all over themselves to hire from Harvard and MIT while pretending UMass Amherst doesn't exist.<p>Then, over the summer, when I decided I couldn't move to Seattle, I worked with a boutique recruiter in Boston who catered mostly to funded-stage start-up software companies.  Suddenly, firms were falling all over themselves to hire me.  I bet it helped that they knew I had a standing offer from a BigCo!<p>Ended up job hunting again this winter.  Got lots of interviews, but no offers until my friend recommended me to his boss.  Got told by a lot of people that they couldn't take the risk of someone without front-end web development experience, that I didn't have the right background (for entry-level software engineering?  Give me a break!), or the most disappointing response, that they thought I belonged in academia and would clearly end up there.<p>End of the story: I ended up contracting, living in my nice town again instead of freaking Boston, and signing up for graduate school somewhere <i>very</i> nice.  But through it all, I can say I've seen both sides of the market.<p>To get a job, you need to cast a glamor/enigma spell on yourself, and seem like you're searching for exactly the kind of position the companies are hiring for.  It helps if you work with someone like this recruiter I worked with, who (if they're good) maintains a huge Rolodex of companies who're hiring.",1343096548

Basically, owners of McDonalds don't own real estate, so that if McDonald's corporation doesn't like the owner they can make the owner out and change owner through an auction. McDonald's can send undercover people to check quality of service at any time, and if they don't like something - number of checks double and warning to owner is given, so that if owner doesn't improve, the headquarters will change the owner.<p>McDonalds is very very dependent on its reputation, because if there are problems with one location, other locations suffer as well.

Or with respect to the contents of the blog post, ""is C/C++ worth it for performing a cumulative sum?""<p>This isn't to say that major strides haven't been made in the performance of high level VMs, interpreters and compilers.  But for some classes of applications, it's arguably not worth trying to avoid C or C++.  Audio software is bound by very stringent realtime requirements (you absolutely cannot miss a sample vector -- dropouts are bad bad bad), such that GC becomes problematic in many cases.  If you're writing a raster effects chain, a sensible thing to do in C would be to pass a pointer to your frame buffer through a chain of function pointers operating on the data in place and avoiding copying at all costs.<p>Point being, the more constraints like these that pile up, the harder time a compiler will have guessing what kind of performance characteristics you're looking for, and though I'm sure there are ways to get around these problems in higher level environments, you may end up finding that the time you spend tuning things to get it just right would have been better spent getting your hands dirty with some C.

It's by having lots of users, and lots of money.<p>- first way you can help do this is by having a minimum monthly charge. I pay $150 a month on a database. I pay 4 digits worth of EC2 bills. I can afford a $10 minimum.<p>- 2nd way is to strongly focus on enterprise plans. For $1000 a month, you get a big giant banner add on gittip, that everyone else sees every time they add a tip or receive one, or play with their settings.<p>- dont make people spend the whole thing - distribute the excess to the developers that others have chosen, in proportion to how popular they are. Or use it to highlight projects you like, or projects for people who contribute money, or something like that.<p>Stop focussing on the low end - bump up that price, and who cares if it's too expensive for some people.

I never seriously thought about cost until recently I talked to a friend, who is about to release his photo app. He told me that it is very easy to spend $200k per month on an app.<p>I think this is a shocking number, consider many apps can't be profitable at beginning (instagram/twitter). I can't afford to release an app if it will cost me that much.<p>I have no experience of managing an app, nor can I predict the cost. Before I decided to post this, I did check some online articles comparing cloud pricing. But those pricing numbers are very obscure without concrete examples. I want to see some data points like this:<p>type of app: phone app (or website)<p>choice of cloud service: Amazon EC2 (or app engine/ heroku/ Azure/ parse)<p>userbase: 500k<p>data types: both text and binary file (image, video ...)<p>monthly cost: $200k<p>I know it really depends on the app, and a well-written code can significantly reduce cost. But I just want to have some rough idea.  To be frank, my budget for maintaining my app is $1000/month at most. I don't know what kind of userbase I can support with that kind of money. Or must I be founded by VC?",1343095363

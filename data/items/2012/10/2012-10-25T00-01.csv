4695834,comment,4694499,4694703,13,0,tenderlove,,,"> Named arguments<p>yes, though it's basically an optional argument hash.  AFAIK, you can't do <i>required</i> named arguments without weird hacks, or specifically checking the arguments.  For example:<p><pre><code>    irb(main):007:0> def foo(bar: bar, baz: Object.new); [bar, baz]; end
    => nil
    irb(main):008:0> foo(bar: 1)
    => [1, #<Object:0x007fcaa40db4e0>]
    irb(main):009:0> foo(baz: 1)
    NameError: undefined local variable or method `bar' for main:Object
    	from (irb):7:in `foo'
    	from (irb):9
    	from /Users/aaron/.local/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
    irb(main):010:0>
</code></pre>
This hack makes the ""bar"" parameter required, but only because the value is evaluated when the method is called, and you get a NameError (rather than an ArgumentError).<p>> Selector namepaces<p>yes, but it's called refinements.  You can see how they're used here:  <a href=""https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/test/ruby/test_refinement.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/test/ruby/test_refin...</a> (sorry for the link to a test, I'm feeling lazy ;-) )<p>> Multiple inheritance<p>Sorry, there won't be multiple inheritance.<p>> Incremental performance improvements over 1.9's VM<p>yes, ko1 has been working on removing / optimizing bytecodes in the VM.<p>> Better compatibility with non-unix environments and small/constrained devices (embeddable)<p>I don't know of any work on this other than mruby, which isn't MRI.<p>> Sandboxed VM's (VM per thread)<p>nope. <a href=""https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7003"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/7003</a><p>Other stuff:<p>* DTrace probes<p>* Better <i>within</i> ruby tracing <a href=""https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6895"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/6895</a><p>I run edge ruby against rails daily.  The main incompatibilities I've hit in Ruby 2.0 are what methods respond_to? searches (I've blogged about that here: <a href=""http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/09/07/protected-methods-and-ruby-2-0.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tenderlovemaking.com/2012/09/07/protected-methods-and...</a> ), and the `Config` constant has been removed (which is sometimes an issue for C extensions).<p><i></i>EDIT<i></i><p>Just thought of this for the required args:<p><pre><code>    irb(main):001:0> def foo(bar: (raise ArgumentError), foo: Object.new); [bar, foo]; end
    => nil
    irb(main):002:0> foo(bar: 1)
    => [1, #<Object:0x007fc65a882f48>]
    irb(main):003:0> foo(foo: 1)
    ArgumentError: ArgumentError
    	from (irb):1:in `foo'
    	from (irb):3
    	from /Users/aaron/.local/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
    irb(main):004:0>
</code></pre>
You could probably define a private method like `required` or some such, like this:<p><pre><code>    irb(main):001:0> def required(name); raise ArgumentError, ""missing param: %s"" % name; end
    => nil
    irb(main):002:0> def foo(bar: required(:bar), foo: Object.new); [bar, foo]; end
    => nil
    irb(main):003:0> foo(bar: 1)
    => [1, #<Object:0x007fcfea143338>]
    irb(main):004:0> foo(foo: 1)
    ArgumentError: missing param: bar
    	from (irb):1:in `required'
    	from (irb):2:in `foo'
    	from (irb):4
    	from /Users/aaron/.local/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
    irb(main):005:0></code></pre>",1351126511

I applied for a while but the common trend was that you needed  3-5 years of experience for entry level positions and my personal finance prohibited me from doing an internship.<p>I am not a great programmer but think I am pretty good.  As a Linux admin I come into contact with developers of various degrees and would say without a doubt that my programming knowledge exceeds some of theirs at times.  It's odd to say that but meeting a senior web developer who has no idea what GET or POST are does cause concern.  Or one who when you mention rest looks at you with a blank stare even though their rails is architected on rest.<p>My problem is I have been a linux admin for the past two years and whenever I apply, no matter what I do I am instantly pushed aside due to that.  I asked this question some time ago on another site and was told to put up personal projects on github.  I did and it looks great.  The problem now is HR at many of these companies presumes that admins can't code so why would he have a github.  It's an odd association because most of the admins I know also have CS degree's and can code.  They may not understand/remember the specifics of OO or how to create a socket in C but they can program. If you asked them to do something they would look up what they don't know like anybody else and get it done.<p>I could say that I am a Python programmer but the truth is it doesn't really matter what language it is.

As a result, no matter which CAs have been compromised by which foreign governments, Chrome isn't going to believe that a pinned site, like MAIL.GOOGLE.COM, is represented by a Diginotar or Comodo certificate.<p>The obvious problem with that is that you have to call in a favor from Google to get that level of security.

A web server would rather always have a reasonably low latency than somewhat lower latencies in most cases with a chance for an occasional latency spike.<p>Also, small, well-contained C++ program would probably perform better than Java, and I don't know how big is each of Google's C++ apps.<p>And like I said, this is very hard to prove; it's just been my experience after replacing a couple of legacy C++ apps with Java ones. But I think it could be ""theoretically proven"" (if that even means anything for such an empirical claim), by analyzing why and where C++ has any performance advantages vs. where Java has them, and showing that the larger the codebase and the team, the C++ advantages must disappear, while Java's become more significant.<p>Just to give two examples of why that should be: in a large application, the domain model might require some class methods to be virtual. The JVM can detect at runtime that in practice only one or two implementations are present, and would inline them. This is not possible for the C++ compiler. The other example is memory management. Java's memory allocation is so much faster than malloc (it's just a pointer bump), allows for better concurrency, and automatically reduces fragmentation. The way to get good memory management in C++ is by forsaking malloc for manual management (say, object pools), but that becomes increasingly difficult to maintain in a large, ever shifting codebase with many developers involved. Also, Java has better concurrency support which is, as you've said, important for throughput.<p>The only counter example is arrays of structs that are simply not supported on the JVM, and where C++ would have obvious cache-miss advantages.",1351124744

Would never do ANYTHING to discourage a young entrepreneur.  I hope you go on to more, equally interesting, things.<p>I got a smallish exit a few years ago now, similar sort of range, did much worse with it.  Unfortunately we took our $$ mostly in stock and that was depressing - seeing other companies selling for much more while our tech languished ignored in our acquirer as it tanked and our stock became worthless :-/<p>I think that your example is great, I just disagree with the premise of the article that being broke is ""a founder's greatest asset"".",1351123479

I am a college dropout and had no degree. I sent literally hundreds of resumes out to every conceivable tech company. Never even got a call back. Newspapers (remember those?) were full of smug pundits telling us ""The Internet is dead!"" or ""The Internet is a fad!"" Huge companies were going bust by the day.<p>This was the way I made it work. I wasn't about to go back home to Indiana and live with my parents again, so I hustled.<p>2001 was a <i>totally</i> different timeframe and mindset than exists now in the tech industry. It's easy to look back, 11 years later, and say ""It's easy"" or ""Startups get valuations 10x higher than that pre-revenue"" or ""She could have just gone to Google and made that much money."" None of that was happening in the tech bust of 2001.",1351123411

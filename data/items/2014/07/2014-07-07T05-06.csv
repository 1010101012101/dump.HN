ML has a rich theory much of which is applicable to both Rust and Swift&#x27;s type systems.<p>This is even more applicable to Rust where the system that deals with lifetimes and ownership are based on ideas that evolved out of linear/affine type systems that can track resource consumption.<p>Funnily enough linear type systems have a direct connection to linear logic, and via the Curry-Howard-Lambek there is another correspondence to symmetric/closed monoidial categories. Even though sometimes it appears like there is no theory behind these languages, Rust has definitely been aggressively importing some cutting edge thinking from programming languages.",1404712737

You sir, shut down every thread in that post in which someone even suggested that Aaron might be in trouble.

It is not a &quot;probability&quot;, which I&#x27;m happy to leave with a frequentist definition.<p>That is, Bayes&#x27; theorem should read: p(h|e) = P(e|h)*p(h)/P(e)<p>where the lower-case &quot;p&quot;&#x27;s indicate plausibility (degree of belief) and the upper case &quot;P&quot;&#x27;s indicate probability as measured by frequency of occurrence.<p>Probabilities under this system are completely objective. Plausibilities are--naturally--subjective. As someone who advocates for an epistemology of a knowing subject (that is: there is no knowing without a subject that knows, and the central question of epistemology is how that subject knows) it is entirely natural that the degree of belief in a proposition should be subject-specific. After all, whose degree of belief is it?<p>This is not a failure of the Bayesian approach, but a virtue: it allows us to successfully navigate the many traditional paradoxes of subject-free theories of knowledge, which put &quot;truth&quot; outside of the realm of the knower and pursue a false goal (certainty) much like pre-scientific alchemists pursued the false goal of the philosopher&#x27;s stone.",1404711286

Out here in Oklahoma and on some of my trips around the midwest, every little kid who sees my car knows the difference between a new base model Mustang and a Mustang GT and gets excited to hear a real 420HP V8. Lots of young guys I&#x27;ve met -- in college, through friends, in the military, etc. -- have also had their share of fast cars or tuners. A good number have even done a restoration or two.<p>As for the women, plenty of college girls and other young women notice what I&#x27;m driving and give me complements. A nice car definitely still gets attention from the ladies. Quite a few I&#x27;ve know even enjoy driving stick and like to go pretty fast.<p>I&#x27;ll admit, young people may be more practical and economical with their vehicle purchase decisions, but car culture is still very alive and strong here.",1404709946

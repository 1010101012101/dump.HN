There are a lot of people on Facebook who were formerly on Orkut, Myspace etc who've never had a twitter account and just don't GET twitter. If I had to pick the next facebook sized network, it would be Google+ and not twitter for that reason.<p>PS: I don't even believe the current growth/engagement numbers coming out of twitter entirely. There's a lot more spammy accounts there than used to be that put out hundreds of tweets a day and I wonder if that's heavily padding twitter's user growth currently. Most of my current followers are ""fake"". Same with my friends who aren't particularly famous. The statistics don't reflect this properly.",1343458697

The NSA are <i>not</i> - so far as I'm concerned - the ""good guys.""

This agreement may consist of usual bodily examinations and/or restorative tests to watch your restoration for the coming months and years. People treated for appendix enlargement will usually require following up with an oncologist, a physician, or an internal medication expert to scrutinize any symptoms of abdominal recurrence, such as pain, illness, blood in the stool, severe bloating, and cramping.

Over a week, just about ever bit of current music. We old folk also has a device known as a ""tape cassette recorder"". (look it up young people) Now, some naughty people worked out that you could take the output of the radio and connect it to the input of the tape recorder, and record what was playing on the radio. Wait for the weekly top 40 (or whatever) show, and 2hrs later, you've got the top 40 singles. With decent kit, we could get very good quality recordings, and with clever use of the record levels the DJ, etc could be eliminated. Now, some clever people came up with the idea of making a radio that also had a tape cassette recorder built in. This machine had one single use. It made recording off the radio trivial.<p>So, back to 2012, what is the difference between manufacturers making radio cassette recorders for the exclusive purpose of ripping audio from the radio, and what this site does? Youtube basically broadcasts like radio, all be it on demand, and this site is basically a cassette recorder. Also, does any one remember being hunted down by their local radio station for pirating?",1343455979

If you were some oracular machine you could see the data and generate hypothesis and priors for them independent of the data and still not fall for the problem you state.<p>And then there is the problem of how do you form sensible hypotheses without at least knowing the shape of the data first.

It was basically his invasion force. Apple at that point was in crisis, and wasn't particularly big. Market cap: $2 billion. Revenue $7 billion, down from $11 billion two years before. Employees, 9,300. They were doing basically one thing, selling computers, and they were obviously fucking it up.<p>Microsoft is much larger ($250 billion market cap, 92,000 employees), and they're still fat and sassy on their monopoly rents from Windows and Office. Few there feel any reason to change. The company is so much larger than Apple was that just getting a handle on it is a massive task. Actually turning it around is a very tall order.<p>Even though Apple was much smaller, it was something like 7 years before things really started to take off. Even if somebody could turn Microsoft around as quickly, how will they get the board and the investors to sit still for such a long period? Jobs could do it because Apple was his baby and Jobs was Jobs. But who has the mojo to do it with Microsoft?<p>A much more likely path is the one Yahoo is on: slow decline plus musical CEOs as a variety of highly paid people rearrange deck chairs over and over.",1343455489

4304838,comment,4304364,4304762,2,0,publicfig,,,"I do think that last statement depends on how you're looking at each company's products. As often as the debate is set up as ""Microsoft v. Apple"", they are two different companies that aren't always directly competing. When Apple released the iPod, it didn't directly hurt Microsoft but built up Apple. Even the iPhone, while taking away from Windows Mobile, didn't do much to really stop Microsoft, but once again built a major market in an area that was typically focused in on as specialized. Apple wasn't competing directly with Microsoft at this time, it was competing around them. It wasn't until the iPad that Apple really hit a market where Microsoft was investing resources into with little return, and took potential growth from them.<p>I think that to say that Microsoft has the chance to retake Apple with the direction they're taking misses the core reason why Apple has become so big. Apple didn't build their company back up through competition, but through creation. That's not a statement saying that Apple was in their own bubble and not taking massive amounts of inspiration from others. It is saying that they as a company defined the market, leaving companies like Microsoft at a step behind no matter what. It's like Apple joining the gaming console market. Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony would have way too much of a lead to make it easy, and if they focus on developed markets they are going to be constantly fighting to keep up instead of pushing the fight forward.",1343455337

4304835,comment,4304364,4304762,5,0,latch,,,"Methinks you both might be missing the economic meaning of ""lost decade"". It essentially refers to a gradual decline. There can be no doubt that, from its shares, it _has_ been a lost decade. Even breaking even would be considered a decline in comparison to other similar investment options.<p>Also, talking about what Microsoft might do in the future, doesn't magically erase the financial and business criticism of the past. If anything, past performance is a better indicator than ""if XYZ can turn around, so can we"". Momentum is huge.<p>As for Microsoft having ""positions in all the right places"". They have an amazingly strong position in two massive markets. Again, lost decade refers to growth and decline, and unfortunately for Microsoft, neither of these markets is seeing nearly as much growth as other markets. No one is saying that Microsoft isn't making a fortune on desktop and enterprise sales, they are saying that they are failing to capture key markets, such as mobile and tablets. In some markets, like internet or entertainment, their market share isn't horrible, but it's costing them a fortune.<p>In short, Microsoft's stock price is horrible. If Microsoft thinks the stock is undervalued, they should be buying it back. They are insignificant in a number of important markets, and in those markets where they are a player (but not a leader), they tend to be losing massive amounts of money.",1343455325
4304834,comment,4302626,4302626,1,0,saurik,,,"Some of the comments in here are inaccurate. Clojure actually does <i>not</i> have very good anonymous function syntax (as well evidenced by the confusion the author of this mailing list post had with returning vectors: that syntax isn't even really ""anonymous functions"" but is more ""expression templates/lambadas""), which causes macros (a construct that isn't actually first-class in this kind of language, leading to bizarre and bothersome failures to compose primitives) to be used in many places where functional programming would serve better (as the core special forms--like if--take implicitly in evaluated arguments in a language that is otherwise strict call-by-value rather than anonymous functions, you then need macros to build syntax similar to them). In point of fact, using Python decorators solves the specific problem indicated by this article quite well (and that's how I was handling that same problem in Python before my recent switch to Clojure, which while not perfect by any stretch of the imagination is still one of my favorite languages to date).",1343455299

In my modest opinion the BIG trade off is between a system that really do a semantic interpretation and a system tha quickly supply a service to a user (buyer) in a DETERMINISTIC/fast workflow.<p>Please let consider the usual example I propose: an ecommerce shopping: I call this a bussines service, that &quot;have to&quot; bring user to purchase something as goal, &quot;as talking by phone&quot; with the buyer (BTW I worked a bit on a proximity ecommerce project <a href=""http://www.rosposhop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rosposhop.com</a>, where buyer and seller live in the same area and know each other personally).<p>So the state-machines composistion I proposed is maybe naif but focus on a deterministic workflow, to achive some business goal/task.<p>To be pragmaticals:\nThere is some (open-source) NLP to already done to realize a &quot;simple&quot; task as a &quot;ecommerce&quot; text conversation&quot; ? \nI&#x27;m looking forward for it :)<p>giorgio",1453636783

That means at the time when his programming abilities started to decline.<p>Citation needed. Even accepting the results of various studies that show age-correlated decline in some measures of programming ability, one cannot take those results and conclude that a specific programmer&#x27;s ability began to decline at 30.

The design makes it easy to exert a lot of force to prevent the bit from camming out, and the amount of torque one can generate is astounding.  Braces are measured by the diameter of the rotation; most good ones are in the 8&quot;-10&quot; range, which is probably more appropriate for casual use.  14&quot; and up were generally for driving big augers, and you need every bit of that torque.

I need to clarify my intentions for this project.<p>This tool is a side effect of my main project. I am working on hacking embedded device. During my work, I found out, that device is using Google Protocol Buffers to communicate with Android app and windows C/C++ application.\nIt was my first time with protocol buffers. \nI was looking for any tool, which would help me analyze protobuf messages.\nIt seems there is none, so I had to learn it by myself :P.<p>&quot;Protocol buffers are Google&#x27;s language-neutral, platform-neutral, extensible mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.&quot;<p>How it works:\n1. Developer wants to exchange data between different applications/systems.\n2. One describes data in human readable form in proto file:\n      message Person {\n         required string name = 1;\n         required int32 id = 2;\n         optional string email = 3;\n      }\n3. This file can now be compiled by protoc.\n4. Generated code (Java, C++, Python) is then imported to an application.\n5. Develoepr can use this code to decode serialized stream.<p>Now - the most important thing. Protoc output code contains serialized descritor of proto file. This descriptor (in serialized way) is included in every application using protobuffs.<p>Once extracted (strings, debugger, any other tool), one can run pbd to disassemble it.<p>In short: Pbd allows to go from point 4. to point 2.\nOnce descriptors are disassembled, one can rerun pbd to generate code and deserialize protobuffs messages.<p>Hope it clarifies it a bit.<p>This project is in beta. Further work depends on interest and needs. I am very happy to hear more comments and ideas. Thank you for your interest.<p>PS. Pbd name was chosen with premeditaion. It is a bit confusing, but hey - hackers need to be focused :P.<p>BR\nRsc",1453636079

10962238,comment,10960872,10961934,0,0,sparkie,,,"Most adults are consumers, but children are curious. You&#x27;re looking at the wrong group if you think any kind of revolution will happen among the current generations.<p>When people argue that not everyone needs to learn to program, I contrast it to the idea that not everyone needs to learn to read. If you imagine the demand for competent readers before the printing press, it would be a similar situation to the demand for programming skill now. The ability for us all to read and share information is what has led to rapid progress. Imagine doing science without publishing text, but instead, all of our scientific ideas needed to be expressed in words and gestures, via conferences. Such thing just can&#x27;t scale to the level it needs to be to have any progress. You simply can&#x27;t do science without the ability to read and write.<p>It&#x27;s becoming clear now that you can&#x27;t do science without the ability to program too. Computers are a far more powerful medium for sharing ideas than text. When we use only text, to find anything of relevance in a big body of it, the author needs to write an &quot;index&quot; and map page numbers to alphabetically sorted words. He needs to manually update that index when the text is revised. (Fortunately, most papers are written with software which does this automatically now, but papers without hyperlinked contents/indexes are still abundant). In schools, children are taught the basic skills they need to do this, but little more which could accelerate their ability to share ideas.<p>We need to start thinking of programming ability as a core basic skill, among language, math, science and humanities. Most of it can be taught via math, language and science, and it would give children, who are naturally creative, a skill which they can use for absolutely anything. The idea that you learn to program to get a job as a programmer is a complete nonsense argument, it&#x27;s like suggesting everyone learns to write so they can become authors.",1453635369

It only looks good and practical at the same time when you&#x27;ve taken a printscreen, scaled it down 60% and don&#x27;t try to read the text.<p>If you try to actually use this on a normal sized and normal resolution screen the text would be too small to read. So, to solve this you have to increase the text size, but this means each element becomes too big so that nothing fits, to solve this you have to reduce the padding of each element but then it doesn&#x27;t look as good anymore. The contrast of the text is also too faint and if you make it more clear the &quot;wow-looks&quot; of the concepts are all gone. I think this is why you hardly ever see designs like this in the wild.<p>What I mean is, open this picture[1] and resize it to comfortable reading level, after doing so i can only see slightly more than half of it vertically. Things that previously looked like pretty design elements now just seem to waste space, like why would i need a thumbnail of a map and a movie-cover on my start screen?<p>It&#x27;s just like architects designing the block of a city, they always show fancy renders of the place from <i>above</i>(?!) in the best weather imaginable.

Maybe there'll be polygamous Mormons. The first people involved will inevitably be those who want to do things they can't do on land, and we have to deal with that.""<p>Is total laissez-faire at all desirable?",1232434615
441489,comment,441156,441390,0,0,Rod,,,"There are way too many hedge funds building trading systems. Some know what they are doing, but many don't. Trading algorithms are important, but choosing a financial instrument which one understands well and other people understand not-so-well is also critical.<p>Personally, I think that stocks are too <i>simple</i>. Many people understand them reasonably well. Microsoft's stock is not that different from GM's stock, though Microsoft builds software and GM builds cars. Bonds are more complex. Commodities are even more complex: trading crude oil is not the same as trading sugar or corn. Structured products are probably the most complex of all (not even the banks know how to price them), which leaves room for the small guys to dream of making a profit.<p>Quoting Paul Graham ( <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/wealth.html</a> ):<p><i>""Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.""</i><p>In my most humble opinion, this applies not only in the start-up arena, but also for small investors up against the big banks and hedge funds. Banks are famous for excruciatingly painful bureaucracy, which makes them slow to react to the market sometimes. Banks typically trade large volumes, which works against them. If there's an edge one can exploit is to trade instruments which one understands very well with people who do not understand them all that well.",1232434505

441478,comment,441314,441314,0,0,likpok,,,"One question is if it is as simple as that. The human genome is immensely complex; much like raw object code (and compacted and self-modifying at that). The number of active genes are far too small for the amount of variation, so maybe she just got a bad run of genes. Unfortunately, that would make Reinhoff's search useless, because he would never find that one misplaced gene, and missing the four or ten that acted in concert to bring this about.",1232433334

Investing in index funds (though <i>plain vanilla</i> they might be) is indeed better than having one's money rotting in a checkings account.<p>A few friends of mine decided to invest in <i>small caps</i> when they were still in college. In the first couple of months they doubled their money. Then they lost it all. If one does have a genuine passion for trading and investing then, by all means, keep trading and investing!!!

Even though there are no visible burn marks on the PCB, when connected directly via IDE to any PC I try, the PC will not powerup let alone POST, which indicate some short-circuit perhaps? This happens even if IDE cable not connected, which leads me to think of overvoltage damage (could be wrong).<p>Replacing the PCB with one from an identical drive does not work due to the fact on most modern drives the PCB microcode is unique to the specific unit itself (swapping PCB with an identical unit [make, model, batch, MLC, all same] results in drive spinning but no detection in BIOS or even by the manufacturers own drive fitness tools).",1232432954

441455,comment,441398,441398,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"The major flaw in Knol, that I see, is that it has contrary goals.  To the extent that Wikipedia does work its success is created by the ""wisdom of the crowds"" mentality where something is monitored by so many people that bad entries eventually get weeded out.  Knol’s attempt to just use ""qualified writers"" prevents the Wikipedia-esque crowd oversight while at the same time limiting the people who contribute at all.  This means less oversight and fewer contributors which is a double wammy.<p>Related to that Knol is clearly a ""me too"" project for Google.  So while a startup or other focused competitor might see the problems that are hindering the service and rush to correct them Knol’s issues go unaddressed which is why it’s so stagnant now.<p>At this point, with Google tightening it’s purse strings a little, I expect Knol will be put out to pasture before too long (which sadly will come as a major blow to those fighting the scourge of horniness)",1232432119

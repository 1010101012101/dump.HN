Of course, many of those habits were developed after K&R, but that&#x27;s why we need revisions and new sources.&quot;<p>This is indeed extremely important, but I also think in an introductory book these details will be very overwhelming. Safety in C is a very complicated topic, and indeed entire books have been written about it[1].<p>I find these &quot;critiques&quot; rather misguided. After all, we all know Newton&#x27;s laws are an inaccurate picture of reality, but one would hardly start teaching quantum physics straightaway. C is a hard language with a lot of bizarre edge cases, and K&R C does an excellent job of presenting the language without all these pesky details.<p>The second criticism seems to be that it is outdated. This is true, but you can catch up with coding conventions and best practices very quickly.<p>To summarize, K&R C is excellent for <i>introducing</i> people to C. I would suggest completely ignoring safety issues et cetera at the start and just have fun solving the exercises!<p>---<p>[1] Secure Coding in C and C++ is a really good book on this topic. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Coding-Robert-C-Seacord/dp/0321335724"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Secure-Coding-Robert-C-Seacord/dp/0321...</a><p>PS:\nSince you are interested in reverse engineering, after finishing K&R C I would recommend reading Computer Systems: A Programmer&#x27;s Perspective.",1428418549

Thus, once a technology has been chose to be invested in overseas, the Chinese go &quot;all-in&quot;.<p>The current paradigm shift is that Chinese anode material manufacturers are switching from graphite based electrodes to silicon nanoparticle based electrodes due to the fact that silicon nanoparticles have a theoretical energy density of ~4,000mAh/g, a 10x increase when compared to graphite which is only ~350mAh/g.

We worked in a team, so creating builds would require checking out each other&#x27;s changes, ensuring we had the right profiles on our machines, and so on. Yuck.<p>You might be thinking &quot;you need to use CI - Jenkins!&quot;, and we tried it. I was at an agency with multiple apps on the go every few months, and getting Jenkins set up and working in a way we wanted was a massive pain in the ass. It was a hot mess of plugins, hacks and external services such as TestFlight and HockeyApp. Other services that offered an alternative — such as Travis and CircleCI — would require access to your private source code, signing identifies, etc.<p>Paying someone else to compile your code made little sense to us, as we had perfectly capable Macs of our own. Roboto is built so that we manage the bits you&#x27;d want us to manage: hosting of the IPA and APK packages, installation pages, emails, web interface, users, etc. You then run the &quot;Roboto Worker&quot; on a Mac of your choice, which does all the compilation and source code management locally. The upside of this is we never see your private data, and your builds can make full use of your hardware — no sharing with other developers<p>We have big plans for Roboto. What you see today is just the beginning. Whilst I think sharing future plans publicly can sometimes set people up for heartbreak (scrapped features, delays, etc), here&#x27;s a couple of things already in the works:<p>- Unit test support.\n- iTunes Connect and Play Store management (metadata, screenshots, etc)\n- Full build support for Android.<p>So that&#x27;s a bit about why Roboto exists. I&#x27;m really looking forward to seeing what you guys think! Happy to answer any questions you guys and gals have.

The extra bonus is that there are a metric boatload of tier 2 array vendors (imation&#x27;s nexan for example) that provide rock solid hardware for a small fraction of the prices of EMC/etc. Its quite possible to get native capacity for less than a company like EMC charges for deduped capacity (aka 100TB from a tier two company can cost less than the 10TB deduped to 100TB from EMC). Raw RAID is pretty simple/understood in comparison to deduped solutions, and I think that has a significant affect on reliability.

It strikes me as elitist and encourages a particular type of groupthink That I am uncomfortable with. As an example, conservative thinking is usually rewarded and less conventional thinking is usually overlooked. In some ways, I find HN to lack diversity in its culture and what it values (which is why I rarely contribute - I definitely put myself in the &quot;on the fringe&quot; category who will remain that way unless some diversity in thinking creeps in, or there&#x27;s a radical change). This is interesting because I am a big contributor at other sites where I feel diverse thinking is more respected .. I am absolutely happy to accept this is my own bias, however, HN is a unique experience for me in that respect (except Slashdot that I gave up on for similar reasons).\nPersonally, I don&#x27;t pay any attention to these scores. I prefer less profile visibility, less badges, less karma and more weighting on an article or comment in isolation.\nIf anything, maybe encourage certain knowledge domains, eg. Science or biology. The domains themselves are less important to me at this moment (except where they are political - and I include gender politics in that: it&#x27;s stifling and off putting to me, despite its current popularity), but it may diversify what I see and view at HN.\nUltimately, I don&#x27;t get a lot of benefit from HN, but there are some (few) exceptional articles that I wouldn&#x27;t otherwise see - which is why I visit HN. Diverse thinking is very important to me.\nI am more likely to attribute HN &quot;rigging&quot; to encouraged groupthink than being gamed. Other than categories and less egocentric measurement, I don&#x27;t have suggestions that would improve things.\nI apologise if my post offends, I&#x27;ve felt these views since I first came to HN.

Australia&#x27;s market for the internet is worse than the US because of things like this distorting it + the distance from the rest of the world.<p>I would never setup a server in Australia because of the ISPs.

9334334,comment,9332162,9332162,0,0,omegant,,,"Commercial pilot here. I´m currently flying A320 like the Germanwings one. I´ve also flown B737-800 and MD-80. Every time there is an accident or a tragedy the human factor steps in. Everybody thinks that replacing the human factor with technology will improve safety hugely.<p>I can understand the point, but I don´t see that happening in some decades. Airplanes have a problem that automatic cars or trains don&#x27;t have, you can not failsafe them with a &quot;STOP EVERYTHING NOW & HERE&quot; system. In a case of fire or any other big emergency or computer failure, you simply perform an emergency stop to a side and you are out of your self driving car in 10 sec (the worst could be that your bricked car is now creating a traffic jam), unfortunately that&#x27;s not the case with an A320.<p>It´s true that we don´t manually fly the airplane most of the time, and that 80 or 90% of flights are mostly routine that could be automatized somehow. But there are certain days, certain flights, certain airports (and this can be the same Airport that yesterday was perfectly standard) were you need to make decisions that a computer can not make. When you start encountering big thunderstorms in the radar, and not a possible way out, short final wind-shear or other limit edge operation,  strange behavior or malfunction of the on board computers, systems or instruments, corrupted or missing navigation or performance data (or flying to Russia were you can not trust , in other words, unexpected situations were there are not clear rules to apply, just your experience an understanding of the basics, and a bit of that Capt. Kirk essence somebody named in other comment.<p>You need a really powerful and independent AI to face the fuzzy decisions that need to be made in a weekly basis. This AI needs to have independent control over the flight computers and controls, independent artificial vision, independent navigation skills not related to the normal rute computer, and a way to know when to skip safety rules completely.<p>If you try to substitute it with a simple AI, you end with problems like the one that didn&#x27;t make the general media but could have ended with a Lufthansa crashing on the Pyrenees this last November, if it hadn&#x27;t been pilot intervention ( <a href=""http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/558483-iced-aoa-sensors-send-a321-into-deep-dive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pprune.org/rumours-news/558483-iced-aoa-sensors-s...</a> ). The failure was of a system that exists purely to prevent pilot error. This system almost sent the A320 in to the ground. Just because the pilots were at the cabin and disconnected the air data computers a tragedy was averted.<p>Unfortunately this happens often enough, but doesn&#x27;t make the news. The A320 model is 30 years old, it had at the beginning a number of fatal accidents due to the same computers that were intended to improve safety (like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_296"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_France_Flight_296</a>  or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Inter_Flight_148</a> ), but we are still dealing with automatic errors like the one of the Lufthansa ( the angle of attack fins get locked and the computers think that you are in a stall, the auto correct the stall with a dive that you can not correct manually, you need to disconnect 2 of the 3 air data computers to disable this saving behavior). Of course there is also a whole lot of money to be lost in sales if a model is declared dangerous, so complex accidents tend to be attributed mainly to the pilots, after all they can no longer give their opinion after the crash.<p>If something, the tendency has gone too far in to automatizing the flight. Flying manually tends to be less and less part of the requirements of big carriers, getting to a dangerous point: in some countries in Asia piloting skills are almost non existent  (Korea, Vietnam, China). In China for example (at least in a couple of Airlines where a number of friends are flying) flight officers are not even allowed to land or take off the airplane, that means that if the captain has a heart attack there is a hight probability of the plane crashing. Once this flight officers are promoted to captain, they&#x27;ll have almost no manual skills for flying the airplane.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that safety systems are not useful or necessary, they really are, and they must be improved and to help the safety of the operation, but they can not be an end in themselves.<p>Returning to making a plane pilot free, you may remove humans from the inside of the plane, but they are going to be designed, build, programed, operated and maintained by humans in a human environment. I don´t see how you are going to get rid of the human error factor any time soon even if you had the perfect AI right now. Remotely controlling or even assisting pilots is a big no no, way too easy to perform a huge attack of docens of planes at a time, using just a laptop and some human engineering.",1428417509

Everyone copied that because it just makes sense. The all or nothing clone model came from BK.<p>How it is all glued together differs quite a bit.  BK has the concept of a revisioned file, git does not, it versions trees.  That&#x27;s why Linus thinks renames are silly, he doesn&#x27;t care about them, he cares about the tree.<p>The graphs of commits comes straight from BK, that&#x27;s BK&#x27;s changeset file - which is sort of neat in that it is a version controlled file itself.  BK is the only system that I know of that uses a versioned file to store the metadata.<p>OK, so on the business model thing, I&#x27;m not sure.

9334260,comment,9328518,9332595,0,0,rbehrends,,,"First, let me note that neither Git nor Mercurial is my preferred VCS, so you&#x27;d ideally want to ask somebody else about common practices (my own preferences are naturally influenced by other VCSs).<p>My own preferred approach is to use <i>hg share</i>, which allows me to have multiple checkouts of the same repository, each with a different current revision (HEAD in Git parlance). This is because when I&#x27;m doing some local branching, I generally like to have two different sets of files to work with (so as not having to rebuild when switching back and forth, being able to easily run side-by-side comparisons, etc.). This is sort of like Git&#x27;s git-new-workdir, except that git-new-workdir isn&#x27;t safe; it is also the default mode of operation of pretty much any DVCS other than Git and Mercurial. This, I note, is not necessarily what the majority of Mercurial users do -- especially since this feature first has to be switched on --, but is one of the major reasons why, if I <i>have to</i> pick either Git or Mercurial, I&#x27;ll generally go with Mercurial. Multiple checkouts are simply too important a feature for me to want to deal with Git&#x27;s workarounds; Mercurial&#x27;s support of them is imperfect, but still better than what Git has.<p>More commonly, in Mercurial you will simply not need to name temporary branches. You will have named branches for your major features etc., and you can use <i>hg heads -r <branch></i> to list the 1-3 heads you may at any time have per major branch. This makes naming the heads sort of superfluous for typical development. Also, if you have only two heads in a branch, <i>hg merge</i> and <i>hg rebase</i> will automatically pick the other head to merge/rebase against.<p>Alternatively, you can use bookmarks. Bookmarks are essentially like Git branches in that they are pointers to commits.<p>Finally, there&#x27;s also nothing inherently wrong with simply using named branches, even for temporary work. It&#x27;s up to you or your organization whether you want persistent or temporary names for temporary work.",1428416886

The documentation, the IDE, and the game:  For the <i>basics</i>, this is acceptable.<p>The game monitor is constantly switching between several HDMI inputs, as I&#x27;m testing on multiple consoles and my PC.  I need to verify my change on all platforms after all.  A dedicated HDMI switch was provided when the 3+ inputs on the monitor itself turned out to be insufficient.<p>I want to debug multiplayer.  Figuring out which of the 5+ chrome windows full of documentation tabs I want back afterwards is a needless distraction, but even ignoring that: I don&#x27;t have enough monitors to dedicate one to each debugger instance and each game instance.  The IDEs are already cramped on a single monitor, with tabs of code, watched variables, logs, and breakpoints all divide and subdivide the space.  I routinely spill IDE tabs into a second monitor for minor bugfixing, and now they get half a monitor each.<p>I wish to double check a function signature in the docs.  A new chrome instance opens, covering up the already cramped confines of what I&#x27;m working on.  I glance - no wait, it&#x27;s been covered up.  I alt tab back and forth a few times, and then notice some parameters had their order swapped.  I buy a commercial license for Input Director out of pocket to treat my netbook as another monitor suitable for reading docs - I might be high maintenance, but it&#x27;s no problem if I cover the cost myself, right?  Even so, I continue split monitors between multiple IDEs.<p>I fix the bug in the inlined function.  The entire C++ universe must now be rebuilt, because precompiled headers were abused.  The overbuilt 6 core monster I inherited from another dev maxes out all it&#x27;s cores.  Fortunately, I already bugged IT into adding an SSD to it.  While waiting for that rebuild to complete, I fix a serialization bug I noticed while fixing this bug - unfortunately it&#x27;s a breaking change.  I now have to rebuild 100GB+ of optimized-for-runtime-on-x-platform assets.<p>A designer complains that everything is crashing.  For everyone.  It will be at least an hour before everything finishes rebuilding for me.  I wish I had another useful computer, that I might be able to investigate the issue (the netbook can&#x27;t run anything of note.)  Eventually, sheepishly, I ask IT about it.

Yes, there are exceptions to the rule, like the story of the 2 year old in the article, but that was added because it fit the tone of the article. The fact is Florida&#x27;s indigenous snake population is more dangerous to humans by orders of magnitude; including, Coral Snakes, water moccasins/cottonmouths, and various rattle snakes.<p>Also, wanted to add that it was good the article mentioned other invasive species, but in particular lion fish happen to be another that is devastating South Florida.  Its really a shame because both the python and lion fish problems are a result of lazy and ignorant people releasing their pets.  Sadly, there isn&#x27;t a good solution to either problem, bounty programs and public policy (with lots of funding) have not helped.  Perhaps one day a big enough freeze will come to South Florida as the article mentions, its not entirely uncommon for a cold front to hit South Florida and to see Cuban Anoles (another invasive species) start falling out of trees in a hypothermic state, but they normally snap out of it in a few days.  I wish more was discussed about the exact temperatures and effects they might have on the Pythons.",1428416440

Here are a few thought regarding comments made in the thread.<p>1) Yes, submissions are manipulated, but due to the flagging mechanic, any bad submission with vote manipulation will be shot down. It&#x27;s worth noting that public vote manipulation on HN (<a href=""https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fnewest"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/search?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator....</a>) is far, <i>far</i> less worse than the meritocracy known as Product Hunt (<a href=""https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=product%20hunt%20upvote"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&q=product%20hunt%20upv...</a>), which doesn&#x27;t penalize <i>spamming</i> people for upvotes.<p>2) Using startup-esque techniques like Recommended Articles and Verified users won&#x27;t work, as it will kill the simplicity of HN (note that Reddit has tried similar systems not too much success). Content is the most important factor to determining upvotes.<p>3) Yes, there are a few articles by YC alumni over the years which receive suspicious amounts of upvotes, and I&#x27;m disappointed by that.

Our platform www.grow.ms aims to solve this problem by bringing Growth Hackers and companies together in one place, thereby presenting the opportunity to post a project, discuss the project details, compare bids, ratings and reviews and select the most suitable candidate to grow their business.&quot;\nSo – having a start-up themselves - the people behind Grow.ms offer a fair and competitive pricing for their service. Posting and applying to projects is free, winning a project will cost a percentage depending on the project&#x27;s value, which is to be paid by the chosen growth hacker. Growth Hackers can be hired for local jobs or work remotely.\nLearn more about Grow.ms by visiting the web page at www.grow.ms today. \nContact: \nVjoleta Maci; Email: press@seedland.partners",1428416314

There are more chemicals in pink salt than table salt, regardless of their source.<p>> Check out this link<p>Completely lacks sources, and the site&#x27;s a bunch of &quot;mercury causes autism!&quot; pseudoscience. That specific article makes false claims. For example, &quot;Unadulterated sea salt usually contains more iodide than iodized table salt does.&quot;<p><a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es0719071"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/es0719071</a><p>> It is a myth (often also false advertising) that “natural” sea salt contains significant amounts of iodine. The iodide content of seawater is only 64 µg/kg or 2.1 mg I/kg NaCl. In evaporatively prepared salt, the iodide/chloride ratio is even lower because of iodine loss; crystallization processes leave iodide selectively in the mother liquor.",1428415849

But people (individuals and businesses) in  practice don&#x27;t seem to be concerned by it -- in either jurisdiction, or most others -- enough to <i>not</i> use software that is dedicated to the public domain like SQLite, so as a creator if your concern is signalling to people that it is okay to use it, a PD dedication seems likely to be clean.<p>And any license text is unlikely to have been vetted by lawyers familiar with the legal system of every foreign jurisdiction where it might be applied, so you probably have the same problem with them (and the more complex the terms are, the more <i>likely</i> that they have some unforeseen problem in an unconsidered jurisdiction.)",1428415298

And there is far worse than this one - some will have you scrolling through an avalanche of meme gifs.<p>I know that these &quot;+1&quot; aren&#x27;t entirely useless in that they show support - but people can show support by other means, and on other websites (for example, by simply upvoting the HN submission). This just plagues any possible discussion and turns the whole thing into a circus.<p>Of course, any form of moderation will make people complain even more, so I can understand why nothing has been done yet. <i>Edit: </i>Maybe a feature to fold nonconstructive comments would be a partial solution at least.

It&#x27;s way outdated.<p>If you have some programming language experience already I&#x27;d suggest going with <i>21st Century C</i> by Ben Klemens. There&#x27;s a decent refresher on the language in the appendix and most of the book spends time talking about all of the things most text books skip over: tooling, debugging, the environment, useful libraries, etc. It also covers C99/C11 which is where anyone new to C should be starting these days, IMO.<p>You might also want to pick up <i>Expert C Programming</i> by Peter Van Der Linden. It&#x27;s also starting to show its age but is useful for a deep, historical dive into why and how C evolved the way it has. It will keep you from yelling, &quot;why on Earth would you ever do it that way!?&quot; when you get a little frustrated with C&#x27;s quirks. There are reasons most of the time (even if they&#x27;re not always good ones in retrospect).<p>Also there&#x27;s nothing quite like ordering yourself a copy of the specification. It&#x27;s not insurmountable and easy to chew through a section here and there as you go along.<p>Happy hacking!<p><i>UPDATE</i>: You can wait to purchase a copy of the ISO ANSI C specification as it can be quite expensive... you&#x27;ll find it on <a href=""http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2fIEC+9899%3a2011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webstore.ansi.org/RecordDetail.aspx?sku=ISO%2fIEC+989...</a>",1428415263

The current state of affairs in the legal system is that there always has to be someone that may take the blame when something goes wrong. Verdicts ending in &quot;accidents&quot; are not accepted lightly, especially when human-made things are involved.

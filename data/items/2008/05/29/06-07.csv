I'm the kinda guy that loves tinkering with analog synths, odd analog drum machines, acoustic instruments of many types, old amplifiers and effects devices, recording gear.  I've owned and played some lovely and bizarre stuff...Chapman Stick, Synsonics Drums, accordion, banjo...as well as normal stuff.  I just think there's an amazing amount of fun one could have with entirely novel input devices like the balance board and Wii-mote.<p>But I'll definitely be buying Wii Music.",1212044183

I've explicitly discussed paradigm shifts that change the shape of the industry.  A ""different business model"" is obviously one such type of shift.  But given the description of the situation, I don't believe the OP is in such a moment in the history of his industry.",1212043814

203077,comment,202342,202926,0,0,bootload,,,"<i>""... WalMart can help by offering inexpensive pharmaceuticals. ...""</i><p>Inexpensive yes, effective maybe, probably no. Walmart works by dictating the price a supplier sells. This is how it gets things so cheap, screw the other guy hard. So the question is <i>""do you want the cheapest drug or the most effective?""</i>. By effective I mean, <i>""it does what it claims""</i>. There are huge <i>quality</i> problems in outsourcing pharma-products to China, India and other non-first world states. If you want to Walmart exerting it's control on drug price, the likely result is cheaper but an inferior outsourced product.",1212043708

Try understanding why the american government revoked his top secret clearance despite being ""da man"" at Los Alamos.

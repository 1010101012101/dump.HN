I didn&#x27;t hear from you but you can also reach me at darthclue@gmail.com<p>With regards to making it to Florida, I don&#x27;t that this would ever happen even if someone stepped up and covered the cost of the entire trip. With my current health, every day is an unknown. When I got up this morning, I had no idea that I&#x27;d end up in the ER yet again nor that I&#x27;d be so exhausted I&#x27;d come home and sleep for several hours. This has become my unfortunate reality. Even if it was an all expenses paid trip it would likely kill me before it was over and it is for this reason that I consider this to be near the bottom of the bucket list. It&#x27;s more for my kids than it is for me and it&#x27;s meant to provide them with happy memories that will hopefully sustain them through my death. That said, if we make it to Florida I will at a minimum be in touch just to say thank you.",1394773154

Regardless of the fact it is waay more dangerous to drive to the airport than it is to fly on a plane - it&#x27;s easy to do a big song and dance at the airport to &quot;make flying safer&quot; (hint: it&#x27;s exactly as safe as it is everywhere else where they don&#x27;t succumb to the TSA rhetoric).<p>Americans don&#x27;t care about the TSA at airports precisely because most Americans don&#x27;t fly.

7397043,comment,7390638,7393273,2,0,vidarh,,,"There are some confounding factors:<p>- The growth <i>rate</i> is slowing. The growth in absolute terms is still sufficient to make the line look near linear when you look at it over such a long time span, especially given that life expectancy is also increasing almost everywhere (see my last point below).<p>- The growth rate is fairly low. E.g. around 2005, the growth rate was about 1.1%, and the decline is slow (e.g. it&#x27;s projected to get to around 0.33% or so around middle of the century), so seeing the change on a graph that plots billions of people against a period of decades gets tricky.<p>- There are large temporal distortions due to changes in life expectancy, and the size of generations. To give an extreme example: Consider if a population to begin with was static - births and deaths were perfectly matched. Now consider if this population stopped having children, yet at the same time, everyone started living 40 years longer. In this (totally impossible of course) scenario, it would take 40 years from the birthrate collapsed until the population size would start dropping. While something that extremely obviously would not happen, less extreme variations <i>are</i>. E.g. some  areas of China has a birth rate of well below 1 child per woman, and the country as a whole is well below 2, while you need somewat more than 2 to maintain a population (to account for men + people who never procreate), but the population is still increasing because population is still young on average due to the massive population growth in the 50&#x27;s and 60&#x27;s coupled with rapidly increasing life expectancy.<p>This last point means that we&#x27;re still seeing a combination of the effect of birth rates going as far back as at least 1950&#x27;s and all increases in life expectancy since, that correctly reflects current growth, but gives us a very distorted idea of where the population size is headed.",1394772403

Unfortunately, they don&#x27;t know where mine originated and it has progressed so quickly that they don&#x27;t give me good odds. I literally went from being fine one day to having cancer the next. There were no external signs and the internal tumors are huge, ranging in size from golf balls to soft balls.<p>I have hope but I&#x27;m also being realistic based on how my treatment has progressed. I have to plan for the reality that I may not have more than 9 months and hope that I&#x27;m still here in 15 years. It&#x27;s a very difficult place to be emotionally.<p>With regards to MD Anderson, I&#x27;ve heard great things from them, however, I trust my doctors and they work with many of the doctors from MD Anderson. Before they did my gamma knife treatment they actually sent the MRI results over to a neuro-surgeon peer group to ensure that the right actions were being taken. They have taken no chances and are doing the right thing as far as I&#x27;m concerned. I continue to do my own research looking for the next best thing and will definitely consider MD Anderson should I find that they have something better available than the treatments I&#x27;m on.",1394771896

7396953,comment,7396113,7396632,0,0,jsz0,,,"> How do they explain why Google is getting special treatment?<p>Not exactly special treatment just the benefit of not being an incumbent telco/cable provider. They don&#x27;t have to face the same regulations (both state/local) and that translates into lower costs to build infrastructure. Google&#x27;s more likely to get special treatment because they are a very wealthy company. You can bet they are already dreaming up what regulations they will apply to Google once they have sufficient skin in the game. It also acts as a nice bit of leverage against the incumbent telco/cable providers. This is not exactly a bad thing overall. It probably is in the best interest of the tax payers and voters.<p>It&#x27;s just ironic to see people cheering this on when it&#x27;s the same exact strategy of self interest that created cable/telco monopolies. Why should we expect a different result here? I bet you 5-10 years down the road the exclusive rights to operate a 10G-PON FTTH network in San Antonio will be for sale to the highest bidder. Google will have to pay up to remain competitive or exit the market. The incumbent cable or telco provider will buy up the rights. The municipality will have a nice little payday. Rinse & repeat.

Instead of having 100 different UI&#x27;s, let&#x27;s have less.<p>Is there any value in either? Half bragging and half common sense does not an engaging essay make. And while I appreciate what I understand to be his second point, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessarily right.<p>Sometimes it makes sense to have more or less buttons on something, depending on its functions. A TV remote with anything less than 20 buttons is probably useless. A UI which does not take advantage of the wide-ranging input is equally useless. A car&#x27;s GPS can&#x27;t really work well with just 2 or 3 physical buttons, and vanilla Android is obviously ill-fitting, even with a touch screen. The author, a serious Mac user, shouldn&#x27;t even be satisfied with OSX. Has he read the UNIX Hater&#x27;s Handbook? It criticizes OSX&#x27;s underlying operating system with the same points he makes against everything but his beloved iToys.<p>I have a simple solution to the problem of too many UIs. Stop buying so much shit. Keep the growth of technology in check by voting with your wallet, and keep your mind clear by not filling it up with anything other than what is absolutely necessary. Use your phone as your GPS and TV remote. Watch TV on your computer.

Connect with your friends, post your pics, keep up with the fam. Yeah, that was then.<p>It wasn&#x27;t too long before they started adding features. Adding value they called it. Extending your circle. Enabling you they&#x27;d say. Yeah, in the same way a spiders web is beautiful. The pattern and symmetry, glistening like shiny gossamer art. Its beauty pulls you in - you don&#x27;t realize at first as you touch it, that it sticks. No, more than sticks - you become imbued with it. The more you move it wraps around you, encasing you... entombing you. For the data-mining black widow to come and suck the marketable value right out of you, your connections... every aspect of your life is now a product.<p>Classified, organized, tagged, sorted, tracked, pegged, followed, poked, monetized, labeled... owned is what you are. A commodity. A small spec among 3.5 billion in the user base of the book.<p>That&#x27;s what it was these days... just simply &#x27;the book&#x27;.<p>Everyone knows - everyone is aware. They are all in the book. Not even a page, or a word either... more like a letter. A single letter. An iconographic digital hologram of the total sum of your parts - all wrapped up real nice in a uniform singular profitable little package called your user profile. Displayed and viewed and consumed and tracked billions of times over. With more than thirty trillion page views per month, the cancerous blue and white digital encapsulation of the human soul was now blazoned across innumerable screens as nearly half the worlds population interacted on the book - more than 20% of the worlds population on the book at any given moment.<p>A study, one of the countless to be sure, said that now more than 90% of real human interactions occurred through the book. What does that even mean anymore... real? Real human interactions? Through the book? how is that even possible.<p>It was no wonder that in the last few years the backlash has switched to resisting this unexpected strangle-hold on the human condition. Most never saw it coming... happily going along with every new feature update, privacy change, &quot;enhancement&quot;. MZ was repeating himself a lot these days... except his frame of reference had gotten bigger... along with his security detail.... Where years ago, the book was likened to that which only came along to change humans interactions every 100 years... now his statements were 10 fold. MZ thinks of himself as the embodiment of the singularity... whatever that means. Some fucking fantasy of a long dead cybervisionary that couldn&#x27;t recognize the makings of our current prison I&#x27;m sure. Fuck him.<p>Looking around looks a lot more like binary slavery than any form of singularity. None of our old problems have been solved - in fact the book has only made things worse. After it became a &quot;platform for governance and outreach&quot; we, people like - those who really see, knew. We knew what this meant.

7324389,comment,7323986,7324297,8,0,chaz,,,"Agreed. I live in NYC, and every corner has been completely mapped, and it&#x27;s a level playing field for almost every mapping tool that&#x27;s out there. Google isn&#x27;t competing on completeness of maps, but rather on transportation data. Subway schedules, route changes/delays, traffic, and construction data all matter a lot more to me than actual geolocation. And in NYC, streetview is enormously helpful.<p>In many parts of the world, basic mapping data is incomplete, and one tool will have fresher data than the other for cherry picked examles. In another 10 years, we can imagine that mapping will all be relatively similar, and integration is what we&#x27;ll compare against.",1393685927

The Metreon was set to house the TrustyCon conference on Thursday but Metreon’s management began to grow concerned after they received calls from RSA’s conference organizers.<p>> The RSA organizers warned the Metreon that TrustyCon attendees were arranging a huge boycott on their premises. In the end, the TrustyCon conference was able to proceed Thursday without a hitch.<p>So RSA tried to suppress free speech (which is what TrustyCon amounts to) by planting FUD to kill a business deal (the contract with TrustyCon&#x27;s venue).<p>Your security dollars at work.",1393685581

This growth in data means that we need an effective way to store massive amounts of data. OpenStack Swift is designed to effectively store massive amounts of data while providing high durability, high availability, and support massive concurrency across the entire data set. SwiftStack is building management, monitoring, and integration tools to turn the Swift storage engine into an effective storage solution that is used by millions, daily.<p>We&#x27;re looking for engineers of all experience levels to join us. We do most of our work in Python, but we&#x27;ve got some Ruby, Javascript, and a few other things mixed into our stack.<p>So far this year, we&#x27;ve built out global clusters for a major expense reporting and travel support site[1], provided the storage system for Disney Interactive&#x27;s gaming platform[2], and integrated Swift into radical new hard drive technology from Seagate[3]. We&#x27;re currently working with companies like Intel and Box to build support for erasure codes into Swift[4].<p>My vision for OpenStack Swift is that it will be used by everyone, every day, even if they don&#x27;t realize it. Swift is storage that is built for the web and already powers some of the world&#x27;s largest storage clouds. I would like to work with you at SwiftStack to see this vision become a reality.<p>Interested? Send us an email at jobs@swiftstack.com. Send us your github profile, your LinkedIn account, a link to your website – whatever will best display the work that you’ve done. Tell us in a few lines of text why you’re interested in SwiftStack, and why we’ll be interested in you.

Even if they can express the same things, and F# is more powerful, it&#x27;s a far more inconvenient language to use for someone that hasn&#x27;t been living and breathing ML for years.<p>Furthermore, in general F# seems to generate far less efficient code than C# does, and for the kind of development I do (games/multimedia) I&#x27;m not really willing to sacrifice even more performance just because some FP fanatic thinks C# should go away. Personally, I think the C# compiler and the .NET JIT should have a lot more tuning applied, and get things like SIMD introduced, but MS doesn&#x27;t seem to care about that.<p>Writing code in C# also makes it accessible to a much wider set of developers. The overlap and shared heritage with languages like Java is definitely a plus, even if I don&#x27;t like some of the shitty design baggage that comes with it. It&#x27;s already a struggle to get the community engaged with my project, JSIL - if it was written in an obscure language like F#, it&#x27;d be nearly impossible.",1393685044

Im not claiming here that all or even most reddit users are &#x27;anti-capitalists&#x27;, or directly opposed to the profit making of reddit, but simply that there is not (or has not yet ben discovered) a means of adequately monetising its community which doesn&#x27;t give the effect of taking control from said community, and things like the revolt against reddit gold and the use of ad-block are movements in this struggle over ownership.<p>I dont, personally, see any resolution to this impasse which maintains both a profit for reddit and the autonomy and control desired by the reddit community, and in this we are in some sort of agreement.

Mipspace does not email abuse and anyone can say an ip is bad and eventually they block the entire range.<p>At this time only a small % of our ip space is effected, nyc1 is the only location we offer that has less than 10% of all ip space on this list..

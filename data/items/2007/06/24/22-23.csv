So I don't think there is any kind of tactile feedback, but I'm sure there is an audio one.",1182725202
30431,comment,30341,30341,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"All of the high end (Nokia S80 style) phones can do flash light but there are still problems with it. J2ME runs across nearly all phones but some of the older phones (Nokia S40 style) have very small screens and the Java runtime seems to be painfully slow (the cpu's are quite beefy buy I suspect the memory access is slooooow). Be aware that despite it being Java there are quirks across the 50+ mobile phones that are in common use around the world. There are a lot of small companies that specialize in testing across this range though.",1182724425

It doesn't HAVE to be this all-encompassing time-consuming project to be worthwhile.<p>Why debate what may happen 3rd or 4th generation when he needs to create something in the first place?  He's excited about a simple idea, and that is what he should do.  Why should he worry about what he may or may not (if he chooses to) do in addition to the original idea he's excited about?  That's a bad trap to get into.  Thinking that one needs to have everything planned out is why few people ever start or finish anything on their own initiative.<p>Does it solve a problem?  Is it something you will use?  Is it something you can be proud to show others (e.g., it's not porn)?  Are you excited about it right now?  Then, create it.  If thousands of other people like it, great!  If not, it will still save him $150 a year and give him something to talk about.<p>Not every idea has to be stretched out to the point it might take you 6 months to create (which translates to 1 year actual time.)",1182724209

30427,comment,30401,30420,0,0,paulgb,,,"What if you generalize this one step further to allow bartering of any kind. I think bartering is by nature more fun than transactions involving money, and although the facebook marketplace probably allows barter ads the features are designed more for transactions with money. If you built a system around bartering and pushed the fun aspect, you may be able to work alongside the facebook marketplace.<p>Of course, now I have gotten completely away from the original idea, but I'm just putting the idea out there.",1182723284

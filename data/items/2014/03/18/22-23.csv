7425649,comment,7421652,7424889,8,0,lhorie,,,"Many people are at a stage where they&#x27;re using jQuery to build large apps and wondering what benefits a framework provides. Not having to worry about script injections is one of the benefits that frameworks bring to the table. This is a perfectly sensible thing to point out, imho, given both tools are used for the purpose of building web applications.<p>The technical implementation of the jQuery test is flawed on purpose, and that&#x27;s the point. People make mistakes, some don&#x27;t know better.<p>Are you arguing that every jQuery dev team in the world audits their code for stuff like:<p><pre><code>  - bla.text(firstName + &quot; &quot; + lastName)\n  + bla.html(firstName + &quot;&nbsp;&quot; + lastName) // bug fix 1234: make name not wrap\n</code></pre>\nOr that somehow the jQuery community is gonna catch that in your application? Or that your innerHTML example (given a user-defined string) does <i>not</i> have a security hole? That you&#x27;re gonna find that commit from the junior guy at 3am at crunch time? That &quot;the developer should know better&quot; is a good security strategy? Are you saying that one API that makes it hard to make mistakes not comparable to one that makes it easy to? <i>That&#x27;s</i> the absurd claim, imho.<p>Like it or not, jQuery is the big elephant in the room, so yes, I&#x27;m going to compare to it, to the extent where it makes sense. Is it an apples to apples comparison? No. Neither is the comparison w/ React. But those comparisons are useful to some people, so I provide them.",1395183561

(The first two of the three words in that quote don&#x27;t apply.)<p>What you describe is a different scenario. For example, one of my clients was a company in Sweden. Almost no Swedes were in the team. The de facto language for the team was English, even though Sweden&#x27;s official language is Swedish. The poster&#x27;s logic would insist that everyone speak Swedish (or one of Sweden&#x27;s minority languages), even though everyone knew English. While you would say that&#x27;s fine.<p>I&#x27;ve also worked for an Austrian company where nearly everyone spoke German most of the time. (Not all of the time; unlike the main thread, I did have chit-chat and work-related conversations. But coffee breaks and lunch were mostly in German.) Okay, I was the outsider.

To be conservative, pension programs (including social security) rely on there being at least as many people around in the future to pay the bills. If you don&#x27;t have any kids, someone else&#x27;s kids are paying the bills.<p>In a vacuum, if a couple has only one child, that child had better grow up to support those two people in retirement. If  four grandparents only have one grandchild, it&#x27;s even worse.<p>The current answers to that problem are immigration (in which case someone else is still paying for benefits) or incredibly low take-home pay for workers (lots of withholding for personal or public retirement funds).",1395183508

They have survived for millenia, and will continue to do so long after we&#x27;re gone.<p>Humans existed for tens of thousands of years without doing anything interesting. Humans did lots of things then. Most of them haven&#x27;t survived into modernity; if you want an idea of what humans used to do before agriculture, there are still some cultures existing now that exist at that stage.<p>The wealth of the West was maybe built on nuclear families; it was also built on colonialism, slavery, white supremacy, patriarchy, and corporatism. Plenty of things have existed in the brief infancy of humanity. Very few of them are worth taking with us into the future.<p>Starting a family is sometimes the right thing to do. Remaining free of children is also sometimes the right thing to do, just like it&#x27;s sometimes right to stay single and sometimes right to have a partner, or more than one partner.<p>Whatever you do, be intentional and do it because it&#x27;s the right thing for <i>you</i> to do in <i>your</i> life, not because of any societal diktat or because of pressure from other people.",1395183488

Lua seems almost ideal as an extension language, and it would be a more familiar language than Emacs Lisp for most programmers.  I want to look at what Textadept does about Unicode; Lua doesn&#x27;t yet support it very well (although there are libraries for using Unicode).<p>It would still be beneficial to learn Vim or Emacs.  The scale and breadth of add-ons for these environments is staggering.  This makes getting started seem difficult, but one can simply focus on learning the basics (which are all that are offered by most competing editors). There are good tutorials for both Vim and Emacs built into the editors.  It will only take an hour or so to go through one and learn the keys and commands for straightforward editing.<p>Another way to get started would be to start with a stripped down emacs.  Although I use GNU Emacs, there are simpler implementations. I like mg. Its a micro-emacs that supports most of Emacs&#x27;s common commands, but has no extensibility. It&#x27;s definitely not a toy, and might provide a nice stepping stone to full GNU Emacs. It runs in a terminal, starts up instantly, and has a small footprint.  On a Mac, I install it with homebrew. Microemacs is the editor reported to be used by Linus Torvalds.",1395182475

Even if they&#x27;re a miserable person with no hobbies, they at the very least spend a lot of time trying to find relationships. If they don&#x27;t, it has a really negative effect on their emotional state. They spend a lot more time with friends to get all the necessary social interaction.

Women in tech are an exception. Combine the two: Women who are in tech and who are good, and you got yourself a 3 sigma std or something.<p>Pull the records and make lists:<p>First list: Of all programmers.<p>Second list: Of all programmers, how many are good (list getting thin, right?).<p>Third list: Of all programmers, how many are men ?<p>Fourth list: Of all programmers, how many are women ? (that was is thinner than the above).<p>Fifth list: Of all programmers who are great, how many are women ?<p>Sixth list: Of all programmers who are great, how many are men ?<p>Now, some may say it&#x27;s caused by discrimination ..

But I&#x27;m willing to bet <i>everything</i> I have that <i>most</i> of the <i>most</i> members are men. And of those members, from those who are really good, almost none of them is a woman.<p>If there was a betting game with these odds, I&#x27;d play it.<p>If I&#x27;m going to get a new job, I won&#x27;t expect people to trust me that I know my stuff(because the <i>odds</i> are that most people suck, it has nothing to do with <i>me</i>).

Demanding it to be any other way is being a cry-baby.<p>When you go to an internet forum and your status is a Newbie, people don&#x27;t expect you are an expert, and this in an anonymous world where no one can pull this bullshit discrimination whether based on gender or color.<p>When you talk with hackers, you have to earn their technical respect, whether you&#x27;re a guy or a girl (if anybody was on a forum).<p>When you get to the army, you are expected to show your stamina and courage and prove yourself worthy.

It has always been that way and I don&#x27;t see dudes bitching about that.<p>Why don&#x27;t we hear about that bullshit in teaching, medicine, etc ? Why don&#x27;t we even think about women teaching ? Because there are a lot more women teaching than women coding and they didn&#x27;t get there by some bullshit rule that says that 30% of chairs belong to women just because they basically are women. </i>This* -allow someone to do something just because they belong to a minority- is the true face of discrimination.<p>I&#x27;d rather have a racist insult me because of where I&#x27;m from, than getting hired just because I&#x27;m from a certain country and they&#x27;re too afraid to hurt my little ego (and the law protects my little, poor me, ego).<p>I&#x27;ve had interesting discussions with racists. I don&#x27;t have a problem with them, at all. They&#x27;re free to have their opinion of me, and they&#x27;re free to hate my frigging guts. I&#x27;d have more respect for someone tell it to my face, than someone wanting to be cool by hanging out with a different nationality.<p>So you make a rule that forces businesses to hire a certain category is the <i>real</i> discrimination. The fact you&#x27;re even talking gender means there&#x27;s something shady in it.<p>So for these women (link article, and comment I replied to) being surprised people assume they&#x27;re not into technical things, I think it&#x27;s a little bit being thin skinned: Most women don&#x27;t code. Someone might argue that most men don&#x27;t, either, so I&#x27;ll rephrase it (because people love getting into arguments): Of those who code, women are a minority. Any arguing on this point is wanting to please a minority by distorting the facts. I tell it straight, if anyone is hurt, sue me.<p>And it&#x27;s getting trendy now. That girl who quit her job at GitHub. GitHub replacing their rug that says United Meritocracy of GitHub (which is weak and wimpy).<p>If there is anyone who loves women, it&#x27;s me. I have 5 sisters whom I love and cherish. But I&#x27;m intolerant to bullshit. I&#x27;m intolerant to political correctness.<p>Now there are quotas to be respected in politics: 30% women. So if it&#x27;s a 100 person membership, you&#x27;ll have to make sure there are 30 women. So if there are some people you really like, you have to sacrifice them because you wouldn&#x27;t be legal or something.<p>And if the number of men grows, you <i>have</i> to increase the number of women even though it adds no value, just to comply. This is wrong and I find it disrespecting to women.<p>Imagine you&#x27;re a woman being used as a hole plug. We don&#x27;t really need you, but we&#x27;ll have you because we have to.

If a relationship between two adults sours, I assert that it is almost always better for the child in the long run for the parents to realize this and separate.

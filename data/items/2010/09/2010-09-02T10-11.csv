Most of the characters now are ""phono-semantic compounds"".<p>Not to be offensive or anything but those ""oh they picked that cause it looks like this"" stories are bullshit. In my opinion at least. Take the example you chose å•¼. That also means ""wild animal cry"". How does that help the picture theory? And even if this one story happens to be true, how does that explain all the other thousands of characters?<p>I understand that you're trying to apologize for the Chinese writing system. But there is no need. It just sucks. Horrible, hard-to-use designs are cobbled together all the time, the Chinese character system is just a particularly prominent example.<p>Now for a quote from David Moser's <i>Why Chinese Is So Damn Hard</i> speaking about learning a French word.<p>And voila! I've learned a new word, quickly and painlessly, all because the sound I construct when reading the word is the same as the sound in my head from the radio this morning -- one reinforces the other. Throughout the next week I see the word again several times, and each time I can reconstruct the sound by simply reading the word >phonetically -- ""a-mor-tis-seur""",1283424723

You're talking about this on a site that doesn't even <i>allow</i> its users to downvote stories.  And you're talking to a power user of that site, who just told you he doesn't ever downvote things.

answer (error+message/success+password), the device should print the receipt.<p>I hope my explanation makes sense and is somehow understandable.<p>I would be very happy if you could direct me to a vendor that could help me on this issue.<p>In case it helps: we are in need of several hundred devices.<p>Thank you for your time.<p>(you will find my email address in my profile)<p>btw: IPhone + printer + duct tape is not really an option.

What's the worst that can happen? Your startup fails and you have to get a job?). A lot - perhaps most - of it has to do with your confidence in yourself. Or to put it another way your ability to push fear of failure (and ultimately fear of what others think) out of the way. To that end, I recommend immersing yourself in true stories of people who (a) have overcome fear, (b) have not let fear stand in their way or (c) don't seem to have fear. Two books that come to mind are The 50th Law (about hip hop artist 50 cent) by Robert Greene and How To Get Rich by Felix Dennis (don't worry it's NOT a self-help book but the autobiography of one of Britain's richest men).",1283422724

Notably, every example joel has given in his article doesn't rely on functions capturing their outer lexical environnment. mapping an add function to an array doesn't, and is still a very useful programming technique.<p>Admitedly though, i really prefer my languages to support full lexical scoping and closures. But i don't think the article was about that, and i feel more like you missed what joel had to say because you think joel should have introduced the full notion of what a first class function is.",1303562541

Geithner would never say so. A weaker currency 'makes them more competitive and reduces the burden of debt,' Gross added.

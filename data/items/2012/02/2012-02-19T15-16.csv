It's a logical statement from someone outside the field - you see ""organs grown in XYZ lab!"" all the time in the press.</i><p>As a biologist, I can tell you that home-grown organs are waaay more than 15 years away.<p>Currently, we can grow skin pretty well.  Mostly because skin likes to grow and is <i>very</i> simple in structure.  We are making progress on growing liver tissue, again because liver cells are particularly robust and the liver is not a strongly organized tissue.  It is (mostly) a big blog of heterogeneous cells that does not require complicated geometry and organization.<p>Anything past those two are wishful thoughts.  I'm not discounting the advances that we have made in growing organs.  We've done some very cool work, but it is certainly a long way away.  Once the basic science is established, it will still take a long time to get widespread medical approval.<p>Re: ""repairing"" the brain makes growing an organ look trivial.

I was surprised that after two and half years that so many popular music albums had only one or perhaps zero reviews. I would suggest that you become more active on your campus and within your social network to get more reviews on the site. If nothing else, you and your team could do all the reviews. I recall Newegg did this in the beginning, but I could not find a link to prove it.<p>As for a business plan there is always affiliate links to sites that sell the music/movies/etc like trueblueponies suggested, as well as ads. You can always think of a more exciting monetization strategy later, but the first trickle of cash would be enough to keep the interest going even it it may not amount to much.<p>This is the most reviewed album I found <a href=""http://www.criticrania.com/content.php?type=music&id=30"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.criticrania.com/content.php?type=music&id=30</a> Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon. It has only 6 ratings, yet is still a best selling album almost 40 years since it was released. Surely there could be more reviews and comments than that just from your social circle?<p>Never give up, never surrender. Never fool yourself either - if between you and your friends you can't write a dozen reviews[1] (or many more) for every album/book/whatever you like then maybe you don't have what it takes to make that site a success. There are always other ideas if this one doesn't work, just give it a fair shot.<p>1. maybe put links to reviews on other sites like Amazon, with an affiliate link.

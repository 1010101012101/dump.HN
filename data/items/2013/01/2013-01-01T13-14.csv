That will make sure you environment is the same wherever you go. You can also compile with -static if you want to go that route.

Hugh MacLeod says it better than I can in 'Print is the new Artisanal': <a href=""http://gapingvoid.com/2012/12/13/artisnal/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gapingvoid.com/2012/12/13/artisnal/</a> (features a great comment from Kathy Sierra too.)<p>A case in point that I read in the <i>Sunday Times</i> a few days ago is Igloo Books - <a href=""http://igloobooks.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://igloobooks.com/</a> - their revenue is climbing rapidly (>$30m last year) and they focus on print (I believe they were only founded in 2003). They're thriving <i>because</i> the lower quality end of the market is hurting. Fiction is rapidly moving to digital but for both high quality and art-rich publications, there's now <i>more space</i> available to them in retail. Igloo, for example, now has excellent placement in retail in a way they couldn't have achieved 10 years ago. Like Igloo, there are many ""traditional"" publishers that are really anything but.. but they're still print oriented and doing well for it.<p>In the magazine scene, at least here in Europe, a common vibe right now is that digital distribution will perhaps wipe out 90% of the print run but that the remaining 10% will be a thriving higher quality industry that's <i>different</i> but not <i>destroyed.</i><p>Here in the UK, frequent visitors to newsagents and stores like Tesco may have also noticed a trend on the newsstand of <i>children's</i> magazines and periodicals taking over an increasingly larger space. This is no accident. With the ability to offer small toys on the cover, stickers inside, and with a very art-driven aesthetic, print really suits these publications and the childrens' magazine scene is blowing up, in a good way (some easy citations: <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/moshi-monsters-sales-rise-magazine-abc-roundup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/aug/16/moshi-monsters-s...</a> <a href=""http://babbleabout.co.uk/2012/04/23/childrens-magazines-getting-past-the-buy-one-magazine-get-five-tacky-two-minute-wonder-toys-for-free-to-something-educational-and-beautiful/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://babbleabout.co.uk/2012/04/23/childrens-magazines-gett...</a> <a href=""http://www.fipp.com/news/PPA-says-UK-ABC-figures-show-sustained-demand-for-print"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fipp.com/news/PPA-says-UK-ABC-figures-show-sustai...</a>).<p>Fewer TV guides, less fiction, less crap.. and more stuff that <i>deserves</i> to be in print.

4992573,comment,4992502,4992502,4,0,teilo,,,"In full disclosure: I do believe there are essential differences between men and women in regards to their child-rearing ability. The skills that each gender has are unique in this regard. This is a generalization, and is not true in every case. Regardless, this means that all other things being equal, there will still be a societal preference for women to rearing children.<p>But let's ignore that for the present, and pose the question: What would it take to equalize the amount of time that parents spend rearing their children and working outside the home, such that the children are still well-reared? Consider it purely economically: People have a limited amount of resources and time. One's gender has nothing to do with that. If men predominantly stayed home and reared children, while women worked, the situation would be the same.<p>Rearing children is a full-time job. Either <i>you</i> are going to do it, or you are going to pay someone else to do it (in which case you are taking away from your home life, and you don't have it all).<p>Men do not get to have it all either. They do not get to have a full-time job, and also spend large amounts of quality time at home. That is why there has traditionally been a compromise: the primary responsibility for child-rearing, respective of time, falls on one parent, while the other has the primary responsibility for earning a family's living.<p>So, what could change this? Employers could start expecting men with families to work less. That would equalize men and women in the workplace - married men and women that is. Make no mistake, though, so long as there are people who are willing to work full-time and more than full-time, those people will be preferred by employers and be better paid. If married-with-children workers worked less, then childless workers will be preferred. This creates an economic pressure on the families with children to make a choice: Someone has to work more, or they have to live with much less.<p>That's the brass tax of the economics of the thing. You can't legislate that away.",1357047870

First, gender equality is never measurable in individuals. It is only possible to measure over a population. Any individual is influenced by so many factors in her decisions that it is impossible to say what decisions are determined by her gender and not.<p>Second, her view seems to be that a man could never put his family before his career. Her realization could have been ""Oh, as a human being I have a hard time letting go of the thoughts of my son who needs me, I guess I was wrong about humans"". Instead, she thinks that it must be a purely female reaction to a everyday dilemma.<p>Her belief that a man would never feel or think the same is so strong that she rather questions her view that men and women are equal, than realizing that she is an individual that, just as many other human beings both men and women, cares as much about their families as they do about their jobs.",1357047383

4992547,comment,4989412,4991536,3,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This deserves a longer response but a short one will have to do for now.<p>You talk about software that sucks. However, one of the quirks of software is that sometimes even when it sucks it can succeed and even when it doesn't suck it can fail. For example, technologically google wave didn't suck, but in terms of actually providing useful features for people that justified its use, it didn't have a leg to stand on. Then look at wordpress, which started out sucking but because it was open and because it had developed a strong community around it ended up getting better and better to where it was finally sort of decent. Or look at PHP. As a language it definitely sucked at the start, and there's a strong argument to be made that it still sucks. But it is perhaps the most popular language for web development in history.<p>Most software is even more difficult to determine success or failure with because even though a software project might not be a success immediately it could be a success down the road. Another case in point would be the Mozilla Project. At the outset it sucked, but eventually it became pretty awesome. How much of the awesome of today's firefox is rooted in the code from the early days of mozilla and how much is due to subsequent dev. work? How do you tell the difference between software that sucks because it is rotten through to the core and software that sucks because it has a layer of crap on top of awesome internals?<p>And then how do you track everyone's contribution to software? Sure you can keep track of commits, but that doesn't track inspiration and ideas. Sometimes the fundamental design or mechanism for a given piece of software will mostly be due to a different dev. than the one who implemented it in code, and often there is no paper trail whatsoever that that's the case.<p>Ultimately there's no objective way to measure either talent or success except in the extremes. Some people's subjective estimates can still be reasonably accurate though, but usually it takes a talented and experienced dev. to be able to judge another dev.",1357046711

Galactic cosmic rays or solar flares are not blocked. The atmosphere blocks most of that, as well as the planet itself. In low-Earth orbit, you have half the horizon covered by the planet, so you get only half the radiation.<p>On Mars, you would get a little lower radiation as you would in low-Earth orbit. The atmosphere albeit thin does provide some shielding and the planet itself removes half the radiation (as in LEO). Greater distance from the Sun also reduces the impact of solar radiation.<p>Normal radiation levels pose little danger in space, you mainly have to worry about shielding during solar coronal mass ejections. When that happens, you usually have a few minutes to hours of warning (courtesy of our fleet of solar observing satellites). For adequate shielding you need to design a 'storm shelter' in the middle of the spacecraft, surrounded by the crew's food, water and waste.<p>Note that we've had astronauts spend years in space and the physiological damage was from low gravity rather than radiation.

She ultimately laughed the whole thing off, but I knew it was an important part of her reality.</i><p>Talking to people who have hallucinations or who hear voices is sometimes fascinating.  Sometimes they start the conversation and you don't know that anything is different, and because they are not lying the story sounds utterly convincing.  And then, maybe, some odd details start creeping in.  Or maybe the story is about alien visitation and it's obviously not true from the start, even though the person telling the tale it utterly believable.<p>> <i>She didn't know that when a yellow car pulled in front of her on the road, it didn't mean there was danger ahead.</i><p>At their gentlest these paranoias and delusions seem similar to everyday superstitions.  I think that's what makes it harder for people to understand just how strong the feelings are.<p>> <i>As a disabled person (who can't work a normal job, because of the severity of her residual symptoms), Sally gets a monthly check for $661. That's it. That's all. No more. Here you go: $661 a month, now go take care of yourself.</i><p>This is the thing I really want to talk about.<p>I live in the UK.  We've had a variety of different disability benefits over the years.  Unfortunately those benefits have not kept current with modern treatment; nor with modern political directions; and now we're in the unpleasant situation of needing to cut our massive welfare bill, but not having any suitable alternatives for people yet, and not having adequate support for disabled people.<p>For example, in the 1980's people with bad back were told to not move, to lie flat on their back on a firm mattress.  Many people were signed off work for years because of bad back.  We know now that's terrible advice.  If there's no underlying illness causing the backache (and there can be serious illness causing backache) you should carefully take pain killers, and keep moving.  Some exercise will help recovery, and some other exercise will prevent relapse.  So, now, with bad back you might need a bit of time off work to let the pain killers start working, and then a bit of time to get the exercise going, but then you can return to work full time.<p>Applying that to MH problems we see that people with mood disorders like depression were cocooned away from stress.  ""Don't go back to work, because you'll trigger another episode of illness"".  But many people want to work.  They do not want to live a life on benefits.<p>Ideally you have a programme that finds people the work they want to do, and then gives them time-unlimited support for that work.  That support would be things like helping someone sort out transport; explaining to a boss what reasonable adjustments (a legal concept) means; discussion about difficulties staying in work and how to resolve those; discussion about any prejudice that is happening etc.<p>Such programmes exist, but are patchy and usually <i>very</i> busy with long wait-lists.<p>And because our benefits system hasn't caught up people can get caught in nasty situations.  There's a variety of benefit schemes to help people get back into work, but if you're working (even with a severe, enduring MH problem) they might take the disability benefits away from you, which can then shut down other parts of your support network; and which can be very stressful for some people.  Coping with complex benefit and tax systems is not helpful when you've just started your first job in 12 years.<p>So, while we have made a lot of progress, there is still a lot of progress to be made.  I wish you and Sally all the best for the future!",1357045626

I think I could persuade you that there is no case where this can happen in an equilibrium of any model, including with uncertainty about preferences, risk-aversion, etc. to a significant extent and over a reasonable range of cases more than happens in 1p1v.

You&#x27;re excited about Rust&#x27;s possibilities -- in web development or just in general? And you gripe it&#x27;s &quot;demanding for web devs who work with a garbage collector.&quot; This makes me pause and think, why are we talking about web devs in the first place? From what I understood, Rust is a systems language and by systems language, it means stuff a lot lower level than `route &#x27;/me&#x27; => controller.toMe!`<p>Thing is about web dev is that (1) it&#x27;s a get-things-done playing field and (2) primarily just data delivery. The idea that you would want a language that doesn&#x27;t have garbage collection is just silly. Why? What complex operations are you doing in each request/response cycle that demands this sort of computational horsepower? And if you are doing said complex operations, maybe you should rethink how you&#x27;re delivering that data and creating it? GitHub is huge and runs on Ruby. Surely, you can&#x27;t be wanting to use Rust to improve your performance are you?<p>> Mutating state across threads is hard<p>Yep, so maybe you should target a language / framework that abstracts this away from you? I wouldn&#x27;t say anything usually but you say it&#x27;s &quot;surprisingly difficult to figure out.&quot; Come on really.. programming languages are not created just for web devs...<p>I don&#x27;t know. If you&#x27;re trying to be productive AND change your toolset, it sounds like you just want a typed language. I wouldn&#x27;t put bet too much of your time-and-focus-chips on Rust becoming a language for web developers. Do you see many people using C++ to write their servers? Nope.

9481437,comment,9481386,9481410,0,0,_delirium,,,"Having lived quite some years in Houston, I see it as just another example of the problem with NIMBYs and zoning stalling urban development, not an example of a liberalized, pro-development city, <i>except</i> (like in many places) in the exurbs. Houston claims to have no zoning, but that is not really true. Whether you call them &quot;zoning&quot; or invent a euphemism for them, there are... regulations on type of construction: minimum-setback requirements, minimum parking requirements, building-to-land ratios, traffic impact rules, etc. that make it difficult to build high-density housing in most of the city. There are the usual NIMBY problems as well. Attempting to get even just a light-rail line built has run into loads of whining and lawsuits from people who don&#x27;t want it near them.<p>Another recent-ish factor is that Texas law and judges&#x27; insane attachment to property rights, to the extent of including various intangible property rights, has a perhaps counterintuitively anti-development impact. Neighbors can take new developments to court on the theory that the new development has damaged some of their own property&#x27;s value, e.g. by producing increased traffic or blocking views (some of this originally came out of a very broad interpretation of &quot;regulatory takings&quot;, but has extended to private litigation). For example, last year, a group of homeowners won $1.2 million from the developer of a new condo tower: <a href=""http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article/Ashby-ruling-allows-high-rise-to-go-forward-5447064.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/real-estate/article...</a><p>It is, however, relatively easy to build new single-family homes in the exurbs ~20-30 miles from the city, which is what the vast majority of those 64,000 new-home permits are for. These technically count as &quot;Houston&quot;, because Texas law is very annexation-friendly, so Houston has annexed most of its suburbs and exurbs out to a radius of ~30 miles. But that&#x27;s sort-of like counting a new subdivision being built in Walnut Creek as an example of development progress in San Francisco.",1430664136

The jury was unable to reach a decision on a third count. Justice Daniel Conviser dismissed the jury Friday afternoon. Mr. Aleynikov, 45 years old, faces the possibility of up to four years in prison.<p>The conviction was the second time in five years a jury concluded that Mr. Aleynikov stole portions of Goldman’s computer code. He was convicted in federal court in 2010, but acquitted by an appellate court in 2012. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. charged him under state laws in 2012.<p>The latest trial was marked by the arcane and the bizarre. Jurors appeared to struggle with how to interpret and apply laws designed well before the computer age, asking several times for charges to be read and for definitions of various words. Midway through deliberations one juror accused another of poisoning her lunch. Both were dismissed by the judge.<p>Even the trial arguments were unusual. Both sides agreed Mr. Aleynikov stole the data. But the defense argued he didn’t break the law, just Goldman’s confidentiality policy. Mr. Aleynikov’s lawyer, Kevin Marino, repeatedly accused prosecutors of acting in bad faith, prompting outrage from the district attorney’s office.<p>Mr. Marino said the split verdict was proof the jury didn’t understand the charges, and that Justice Conviser shouldn’t have allowed the jury to deliberate over a case whose core debate is a legal matter, not a factual one.<p>“You’ve had a jury struggling with this because they’re performing a judicial function they’re ill-equipped to perform,” Mr. Marino said.<p>Mr. Vance praised the verdict and said his office would continue to pursue similar cases to “ensure the integrity and fairness of our marketplaces.”<p>“By allowing individuals, corporations, and government entities to safeguard valuable information, we are encouraging and supporting the research, innovation, and entrepreneurship that is so important to our city in an increasingly competitive digital and global market,” Mr. Vance said in a statement.<p>Mr. Aleynikov emerged as a hero in some circles, in part because of his prominent feature in Michael Lewis’s best-selling book “Flash Boys,” about high-speed trading. Some in legal circles felt his second prosecution was overly aggressive, making Friday’s verdict a victory for Mr. Vance, if an incomplete one. But, as with the first trial, the verdict may not be the end for Mr. Aleynikov.<p>Justice Conviser said Friday that he would rule within six weeks on a defense motion to dismiss the case on grounds of legal insufficiency. The judge has previously appeared to express doubt about whether the decades-old state law under which Mr. Aleynikov was charged applies to his conduct. The defense also could appeal if the judge rules against the motion.<p>The appeals court had acquitted Mr. Aleynikov because it said federal law didn’t apply to the case. Some legal analysts took that ruling as an invitation for the Manhattan district attorney’s office to charge him under state laws, a move that didn’t trigger double jeopardy immunity.<p>Mr. Aleynikov served a year in prison after his first conviction. He went through a divorce and lost his career as the case has unfolded. He walked around the courtroom anxiously after the verdict was read Friday and the jury had left. On Friday, the judge released him from bail conditions and said he wasn’t a flight risk.<p>The trial was unusual in that both sides almost entirely agreed on the facts, but disputed whether New York state law applies. Two of the charges accuse Mr. Aleynikov of unlawfully using secret scientific material to appropriate the “major portion” of its economic value, and a third charged him with duplicating it for his own use.<p>The jury acquitted Mr. Aleynikov on the duplication charge, convicted him on one secret scientific-material count and couldn’t reach a verdict on the other. He was charged twice on that front because prosecutors alleged he stole bits of the code on two separate days during his last week at Goldman Sachs.<p>Throughout the deliberations the jury appeared to wrestle with the law. The jury sent repeated notes to Justice Conviser, requesting clarifications on legal terms and asking to have his instructions on the law read back to them.<p>The jury was further distracted when a quarrel between two jurors erupted this past week when a female juror accused a male juror of poisoning her lunch. She told the judge she became suspicious when an avocado went missing from her lunch, and that her concerns were amplified when the male juror used a pharmaceutical company as an example during deliberations. Justice Conviser said he had concluded the accusations had “absolutely no basis in fact” and dismissed the two jurors before allowing the remaining 10 to continue deliberations.<p>Mr. Marino, Mr. Aleynikov’s attorney, has alternated between antagonizing the judge and praising him, and Friday was no different. After the jury had been dismissed, Mr. Marino urged the judge to give his ruling on dismissing the case Friday, sparking a rebuke from Justice Conviser.<p>“I’d be embarrassed by this verdict if I were you,” Mr. Marino said.<p>“Well, I’m not,” Justice Conviser replied.<p>Later, Mr. Marino said he had the utmost respect for the judge and appreciated his handling of the trial.<p>Mr. Marino has argued that because Mr. Aleynikov didn’t appropriate the code to Goldman’s detriment, and because he didn’t intend to profit from it, he didn’t break the law. Goldman continued to use the code and earned profits from its high-frequency trading system after Mr. Aleynikov transferred some of the code, he said.<p>The judge appeared sympathetic to another argument that Mr. Aleynikov didn’t illegally duplicate the code because he didn’t make a “tangible” copy of the code, as binary computer bytes don’t have a physical form.<p>Mr. Marino has long alleged Goldman flexed its political muscles to persuade prosecutors to target Mr. Aleynikov. The bank’s shadow loomed throughout the proceedings, and Mr. Marino frequently referred to the allegation, even pointing out that Goldman lawyers were sitting in the courtroom.<p>Goldman has previously declined to comment on these allegations.<p>Write to Christopher M. Matthews at christopher.matthews@wsj.com<p>Corrections & Amplifications<p>The jury was unable to reach a decision on the third count.

Customers choose a doctor based (in part) on price, resulting in price competition.

9481367,comment,9480390,9480874,0,0,peatmoss,,,"We still have geometric problems with everyone driving. Namely, cars take up space in two or three useful dimensions on roadways that are fixed in length, and have limited capacity to grow wider or higher. In short, self-driving cars won&#x27;t handle peak demand and the accompanying congestion.<p>Where I am more excited about self driving cars is in their potential to change vehicle ownership economics in slightly denser areas. A car2go that delivers itself makes it pretty hard to justify buying an expensive capital asset that sits idle an average of 95% of the time. In other words, a rental service that is able to utilize its vehicle fleet more fully, should be able to make a handy profit while reducing travel costs for many people. The opportunity frontier is enormous here.<p>Once more people switch to user-fee based travel as opposed to all-you-can-eat-buffet travel, people all of a sudden start choosing how to travel rather than automatically hitting the default option. That opens the door to better public transit, which can handle peak demand, as well as more walking and bicycling.<p>And, we should have room for more and better bicycle/pedestrian facilities, since we won&#x27;t need so much land to store all our mostly-unused boxes of steel and plastic.<p>I think self driving cars will be transformative for cities, but it won&#x27;t be some Jetsons vision of the future where we simply upgrade suburbia with tech.

Each individual in those groups has an equal budget to distribute between initiatives V(1)...V(X), where X > 2.<p>neoNazis desire a &quot;yes&quot; vote for both initiatives V(1) and V(2) - let&#x27;s call them &quot;internment&quot; and &quot;pogroms&quot; - so strongly that they are (or are believed to be) willing to forego all votes on initiatives V(3)...V(X) to pass them<p>Jews have similarly strong views on not being interned or the victim of pogroms, but in the absence of adequate information on how the neoNazis will use their votes cannot be assured of  allocating their voting budget between V(1) and V(2) in a way sufficient to negate the votes of the neoNazis on both issues. \n(Note also that the existential threat posed by V(1) and V(2) sitting on the [future] referendum list also deters the Jews from using part of their budget to influence votes on V(3)...V(X) in ways which might improve their individual utilities)<p>If ordinary citizens have a preference for a &quot;no&quot; vote which would be sufficiently strong for them to vote against it in a regular referendum, but insufficiently strong for them to allocate voting budget that could otherwise purchase decisions on initiatives V(3)...V(X) the moderate majority will not provide the same bulwark against extremism as they do under a 1 person 1 vote system. If all or most Jews decide that pogroms are significantly worse than incarceration and are sufficiently risk averse to warrant allocating all their budget to eliminate the possibility of an equal number of Nazis enacting V(2), it&#x27;s surprisingly easy and inexpensive in terms of voting budget for the Nazis to pass V(1). The only way I can see the Jews avoiding both initiatives being passed is to put the neoNazis on the defensive with an equally vicious anti-Nazi counter-proposal - assuming Nazis can be targeted as effectively as Jews - but I&#x27;m not convinced that mutually assured destruction is the ideal way of resolving voting conflicts.<p>Unfortunately, this also applies to less extreme examples where balloting is secret and intentions uncertain: in order to shift the Nash equilibrium of a particular proposal in your favour you simply raise the spectre of an [additional, and credible] proposal you anticipate your adversaries will like even less.",1430661686

However, it would make future development much more complex; I&#x27;m already struggling to keep up with one language. Especially for German I don&#x27;t think that the effort would pay off; most German speakers understand English reasonably well (epsecially in my target demographic).<p>However, some countries are different. For example, I frequently get poor reviews from Spain; it&#x27;s obvious that the people complaining didn&#x27;t understand the description and purchased the wrong app. It fits my personal experience/prejudice that people in Spain are less likely to speak English. However, a Spanish translation would be more difficult because I&#x27;d need to hire someone, and I&#x27;m not sure if additional sales in Spain would make up for the up-front translation costs.<p>But, it&#x27;s something to keep in mind: Consider how much of your target demographic speaks English even though it&#x27;s not their native language.

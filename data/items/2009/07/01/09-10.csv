In the Ruby (or Perl) community, if you use obscure language features to do a common task in a single line of code, you will be worshipped as a god. In the Python (or Tcl) community, you will be viewed with suspicion. Not that Python doesn't have one-liners (e.g. comprehensions) - just that everyone agrees which ones and when and how to use them.",1246441440

682343,comment,680853,681119,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"Interesting. I'm writing this using Iceweasel 3.0.9 on Debian testing (Squeeze/Sid) on an IBM T60 Thinkpad, 2Ghz dual-core, 2GB of RAM. I currently have 8 add-ons installed and a large amount of favourites and history saved. My profile is quite old and I never clear my history or have to do any special tending to keep performance at a constant.<p>Iceweasel is slower to start than would be ideal, really it's always been so but certain add-ons definitely seem to affect start-up time. But I've never experienced any of these more extreme issues that I hear a large number of people reporting. Nor have I experienced these kinds of issues on any of my other machines (running Windows XP and OS X Leopard on these machines and their resources were/are similar to or better than my T60). I wonder why this is? Is it because I'm not running Iceweasel/FF on a single core machine with < 1GB of RAM?<p>For the people who are having issues with Iceweasel/FF, what are the resources on your machines like? I totally believe you guys that these issues exist, I've read too many reports to doubt them all, I just wonder why I've never experienced them.",1246441117

Unless you build a compiler/translator for it, it is not a ""DSL,"" it is plain-old Ruby, happily accepted by any conforming Ruby implementation--nothing more.<p>After their pretentiousness, their arrogance, and their vociferous obnoxiousness, I find their misuse of this once-widely understood term to be their most annoying attribute. It seems like not a day goes by without some eager Ruby programmer hacking together yet another block-based API that kind of, sort of looks like Smalltalk if you squint enough, uploading it to GitHub or some similar site, and then slapping the ""DSL"" label on it, because Ruby, apparently, is just too cool and powerful a language to have mere ""libraries"" or ""APIs.""",1246441045

For starters, it doesn't work at all -- why the hell does he think typ won't be ""<type 'int'>""?<p>Second, if you're going to use the type builtin for this, why the fuck would you cast it to a string, when ""if type(var1) is int"" works just fine?<p>Third, don't ever use the 'type' built-in for this kind of type-checking -- this is what the 'isinstance' built-in is for.

682318,comment,682264,682298,0,0,sho,,,"That's OK, my reply was also pretty ambiguous :D<p>I am not really familiar enough with Python to say for sure but from what I know, XML libraries are probably superior on the Python side - in fact most ""enterprise"" interoperability libraries are probably better, or at least more mature. The situation on the Ruby side is improving rapidly, but given its history, yeah, many things like that are probably a little behind. Ask again in a couple of years!<p>The flipside of this, though, is that everything in Ruby is currently in a state of flux. The ""winner"" of the libraries is constantly changing and the rate of progress is actually quite staggering. There's excitement, momentum and willingness to embrace new ideas in the Ruby community that seems to exceed Python's.<p>So yeah. If you want stable, mature libraries that you can rely on for the next 5 years, Ruby is probably not the choice for you right now. If you want, however, to constantly live on ""the edge"" and see, say, 5 competing interfaces to the latest DB come out within days of its alpha release then Ruby's the go.<p>This is all fairly minor though - they're both great languages with great communities, I don't get all this ""A vs. B"" nonsense. There are certain libraries in Python that I wish were available in Ruby. There are certain libraries I like in Ruby that I know are not available in Python. My advice to a novice would be to choose the one whose syntax they prefer.",1246439046

For those of us that write applications for single-use devices (medical use, for example), the Apple offerings look really awesome, but the lack of control of the device itself is problematic.

None of them work for us quite as well as going to a bar and chatting.  We've thought a lot about this over the past two years.<p>People instinctively understand that when they go to a bar, they are there to relax and have a good time.  A lot of times, people are really stressed out from a long day at work, and would like to have a drink, unwind and chat.   People don't tend to unwind in a coffee shop or a restaurant.  While I've certainly enjoyed the lobby chat at conferences I've been to, but bar talk with the geeks at hackers and founders tends to be a lot better imho.<p>I'd also say, that the best business relationships that I've developed have involved social alcohol.  I grew up in a teetotaler household, and I've made a point of learning how to drink socially and responsibly.  Frankly, it requires practice.  I think it's actually a pretty valuable social skill to have in the startup world.<p>Final point.  We've pretty much standardized on having alcohol at every Hackers and Founders Silicon Valley, and I have yet to see a single person get drunk, or concern me that they were going to be unsafe while driving.",1270636864

1246918,comment,1246200,1246598,0,0,endgame,,,"I'm also early 20's, just moved out from home, but I discovered tall ship sailing instead of kiting. (Actually, I'd done a 10-day voyage on the Sail Training Ship Young Endeavour before that and that's what made me keen for more.)<p>I'm (trainee) volunteer crew of a replica tall ship called the Enterprize. She's a replica built with period techniques and materials as much as possible. Tarred hemp ropes, hand-turned belaying pins, hand-sewn sails, that sort of thing. The ship's mission is to maintain a piece of living history that the general public can access.<p>It sounds like kitesurfing grabbed you like the Enterprize grabbed me: the major consideration when I'm planning a weekend now is whether or not I can sail.<p>I've found that I've met an entirely different class of people in tall ships than most other things I've done. There's a real difference in the interactions, like the forcefield that people put up when they're in commute/work mode is gone. It's not just the crew, either. The sort of people who sign on as passengers are often easy to talk to and have fascinating stories to tell.<p>Perhaps it's the wind? Keeping lookout while the wind's blowing through you is a fantastic feeling. Perhaps it's the chance to do something physical and immediate? Working together to get a sail set right is extremely satisfying.<p>I guess that concludes <i>my</i> first post on HN.",1270636656

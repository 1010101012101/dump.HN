So net profit tends to be higher there.  So things tend to get researched/introduced there first.  And no other industry seems to require anything close to the additional profit premium that the healthcare industry sees, to do that research/introduction here first. (auto, energy, tech, etc) In fact, the degree to which industries go <i>elsewhere</i> tends to hinge on massive government subsidies designed explicitly to offset this natural reward structure.",1363377531

5382570,comment,5382313,5382313,5,0,will_brown,,,"First, it is good to look at this on an international perspective, but an entirely separate article can be done on why an MRI costs $1,080 for a patient with insurance and the same treatment would be arbitrarily more for an uninsured patient usually about 4x as expensive.  This issue has gone to court in California (2006-2008) resulting in over $1 billion dollars returned to uninsured patients because Courts found hospitals were illegally ""price gouging"" uninsured.  However, price gouging uninsured is a practice that continues around the US, for example in September I received 17 stitches from a FL hospital and the bill was over $12,000 because I am uninsured.  I recorded the entire event on my phone including asking how much the stitches would cost and the staff telling me the bill would be $2,000 if I were insured.  I challenge the bill since I was quoted $2,000 for the treatment and my bill was $12,000 and when I produced the video of the staff acknowledging different price structures for insured and uninsured the hospital immediately agreed to cover my entire bill.<p>Second, I can not believe the Washington Post would publish an article titled ""Why an MRI costs $1,080 in America and $280 in France"", ""America"" really? I try to never comment on a spelling or grammatical error, but honestly we are talking the Washington Post who should know to use ""US"" not ""America"".",1363376809

A tax that is not progressive is inherently unfair IMHO, as it places a heavier burden on the less fortunate.\nEDIT: Someone mentioned that cigarettes are a life choice but I personally believe that to be more of a nice theory than a fact. In reality smoking is huge among people with lower income, due to lack of education about the risks, cultural factors, advertising, etc. (see <a href=""http://www.gallup.com/poll/105550/among-americans-smoking-decreases-income-increases.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gallup.com/poll/105550/among-americans-smoking-de...</a>).

Thanks for asking about this; it helped the indexing team uncover an issue in how we're indexing Craigslist, and we're in the process of fixing it right now.<p>To understand what happened, you need to know about the ""Expires"" HTTP header and Google's ""unavailable_after"" extension to the Robots Exclusion Protocol. As you can see at <a href=""http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-exclusion-protocol-now-with-even.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-exclusion-prot...</a> , Google's ""unavailable_after"" lets a website say ""after date X, remove this page from Google's main web search results."" In contrast, the ""Expires"" HTTP header relates to caching, and gives the date when a page is considered stale.<p>A few years ago, users were complaining that Google was returning pages from Craigslist that were defunct or where the offer had expired a long time ago. And at the time, Craigslist was using the ""Expires"" HTTP header as if it were ""unavailable_after""--that is, the Expires header was describing when the listing on Craigslist was obsolete and shouldn't be shown to users. We ended up writing an algorithm for sites that appeared to be using the Expires header (instead of ""unavailable_after"") to try to list when content was defunct and shouldn't be shown anymore.<p>You might be able to see where this is going. Not too long ago, Craigslist changed how they generated the ""Expires"" HTTP header. It looks like they moved to the traditional interpretation of Expires for caching, and our indexing system didn't notice. We're in the process of fixing this, and I expect it to be fixed pretty quickly. The indexing team has already corrected this, so now it's just a matter of re-crawling Craigslist over the next few days.<p>So we were trying to go the extra mile to help users not see defunct pages, but that caused an issue when Craigslist changed how they used the ""Expires"" HTTP header. It sounded like you preferred Google's Custom Search API over Bing's so it should be safe to switch back to Google if you want. Thanks again for pointing this out.""",1363375888

Working remotely can be a very different experience depending upon job roles. Most of the articles linked on HN are for already-isolating back office jobs like development, but for roles like customer support, sales, an outsourced front desk receptionist, or other highly communication-heavy roles you will not really feel as lonely probably. For coders and asset-producers with pretty clear expected (and more importantly, asynchronous) output, solutions typically focus upon forcing your job duties to include more actual human interaction even if it might not be in-person. However, higher value consultants typically will be communicating a lot more with their clients and spending half your day at Starbucks is going to be few and far between.<p>Secondly, the &quot;freedom&quot; people tend to talk about is pretty minimal in some roles and being remote tends to reinforce the need for your role to be available as much as possible. If you&#x27;re the on-call contact in operations where it&#x27;s arguably more important that you&#x27;re available immediately rather than that you just make some deadlines (transactional work), you really can&#x27;t just take off very often like you can oftentimes with very asynchronous, start-stop workflows like development. You&#x27;re not about to work at Starbucks much unless you can be guaranteed that you won&#x27;t have a really important call come in. I would have lost precious availability time if I was working at Starbucks a few days ago when I had to manage a production outage and get on the phone and start talking authoritatively quickly. It&#x27;s one thing to have a kid or pet in the background, it&#x27;s another when you&#x27;re obviously sitting at a coffee shop.<p>For work-life separation, I recommend separate devices from your personal belongings for starters. It&#x27;s oftentimes substantially cheaper than getting a separate room or larger residence. I have a company-provided laptop that I do my work on as well as a company-provided phone, and that helps keep things separate from the rest of my life. If I have to reach for that phone or RDP / ssh into that machine, that&#x27;s time I&#x27;ve spent for the company, not for me.",1426777193

9232366,comment,9230184,9232221,0,0,Ovid,,,"If they&#x27;re outsourcing to save money, I don&#x27;t want them as a client. As I&#x27;ve said, if they&#x27;re pinching pennies, they&#x27;re not focusing on the right area or they&#x27;re so cash-strapped that they <i>can&#x27;t</i> focus on the right area. Either way, I don&#x27;t want that work and unless one of my associates is in a bind, I don&#x27;t want to make their life miserable either.<p>And no, I&#x27;m not valued on price because even if the clients are in another country, they already know who I am. I been deliberate marketing myself to make that happen. Two books, conferences (including keynote speeches), lots of open-source code, and so on. That&#x27;s part of what sets me apart from many others in my field: nobody knows who they are. It doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m better than them; it means I&#x27;m better known than them. (I apologize if that sounds arrogant, but this has been a deliberate, multi-year strategy to get me where I am).",1426777151

There are online communities every where, they all have their own culture, their inside jokes, their group think, etc etc.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a bit bitter about the topic but I grew up online, I find online social connections to be equally as strong as offline ones. I guess I just feel the whole counter argument is baseless and unproven and not held up by anything more than survivor bias, industry norms and what people say investors hate to hear.<p>The pros easily outweigh the con&#x27;s.

I was driving at a safe and prudent speed given the conditions.&quot;<p>ADD: It is good to know if the state you are in or states your frequently drive in is/are &quot;Maximum Speed Limit&quot; or &quot;Presumed Maximum Speed Limit&quot; state(s). I grew up in Minnesota which is a &quot;Presumed Maximum Speed Limit&quot; but now live in WI which is a &quot;Maximum Speed Limit&quot;. The nice thing about Minnesota and &quot;Presumed Maximum Speed Limit&quot; is that if you are on a highway outside of a municipality (so in a township) then the posted speed limits are only presumed to be the maximum speed limit. Going faster is prima facie evidence of going to fast and allows officers to stop you. However, if you choose to fight the ticket in court, you can admit to going faster than the posted limit and argue that you were still driving a safe and prudent speed given the conditions. So, if you were in the country driving 65 on a straight and level road with a posted speed limit of 55 on a clear, dry day with 10+ miles of visibility and no other cars on the road, people or animals int he ditch or near the shoulder and a cop caught you on his laser device sitting 1/2 mile down the road, assuming you slowed down to 55 mph before getting close to him, you could argue these facts in court and argue that &quot;the facts and outcomes speak for themselves&quot;... no one was harmed or injured showing again that the speed of 65 mph in those conditions and circumstances was in fact still safe and prudent. In Wisconsin, if you admit to going over the posted speed limit anywhere, you&#x27;re guilty of not driving a safe and prudent speed no matter what.<p>IANAL, but this book was an eye opener: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1413312519/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1413312519&linkCode=as2&tag=ptbgw-20&linkId=XU424AMFF4KCUYEI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1413312519/ref=as_li_tl?ie=...</a> (affiliate link) save your money though and borrow it from the library.",1426776974

Additionally, The EU is actively charming the non-NATO-members like Finland into participation, and with its East-Europe policy adds more strategic debt and more economic powerhouses in waiting to their territory<p>Ironically, the Russian actions in Ukraine force Europe to stand closer together, and may as well lead to even tighter integration.<p>Additionally, if you take the military capability of France, GB, Germany, Italy and Finland, The necessity for an American &quot;Proctection&quot; is scarecely needed.

The purpose of an act can&#x27;t change retroactively, but the proceeds of an act carried out with one purpose may well have a different purpose than that of the act when it was carried out.<p>Now, obviously, in the case where the party flying the drone has an ongoing operation of monetizing videos that exists prior to the time the drone is flown, flies the drone, and quickly turns around and monetizes the video from the drone, the combination of factors is pretty strong evidence that the drone was used commercially rather than the video being commercialized after the drone was flown.",1426776584

I understand this in a way I couldn&#x27;t have before!&quot; How would the alien interpreter analyze the situation?<p>The alien may say that these sensations activate a different part of Mary&#x27;s brain and alter the structure to create memories. If she were put back into the room, she could recall what it was like to perceive color. These memories could be defined as knowledge, but the alien might not consider that knowledge important. It might just say that is an artifact of the operation of her primitive brain that these sorts of neuronal patterns can only be created by perception with her eyes.  From it&#x27;s perspective, the entire interaction is still entirely physical. The alien could have predicted her reaction just prior to her stepping out of the room by looking at the structure and state of her brain.<p>The alien may add prior to her stepping out &quot;By the way, she&#x27;s going to say that experiencing color is different than knowing of it (qualia). This is a curious artifact the way her brain works.&quot; I think it would be impossible for me (a human) to prove the alien wrong.

We&#x27;re mostly active in Brooklyn/Manhattan right now to gather feedback and learn how to make this work. Would definitely love to hear any thoughts you all might have on SpareChair, too.",1426776186

My checklist of things I do for sanity goes something like this:<p>1. Set up regular lunch get togethers with friends.<p>2. Use Video Conferencing liberally. Don&#x27;t keep trying to hash something out via email or chat for too long. At some point the higher bandwidth of face to face communication even over a VC will be much more efficient.<p>3. Keep a persistent group chat for you team open. IRC, Slack, Anything that is always on and provides a sense of presence for you. Don&#x27;t be afraid to joke around and make small talk there. Out team even plays the occasional verbal logic puzzle there.<p>4. Stock some variety in your kitchen. You get bored of Bologne and PB&J after a while. You are going to want to provide some variety for lunches.<p>5. Be responsive but only during regular working hours. It helps your team to know <i>when</i> they can contact you and get a response. After 5pm I don&#x27;t respond to txts or emails unless they are emergencies. But before then I make sure people get a quick response from me even if it&#x27;s just that I&#x27;ll have to get back to them later.<p>6. And lastly join a Gym. I swim regularly but you might run or play some basketball or lift weights. When your place of work is your home it can be hard to disengage.

I should really write a full blog post on all the details. Just a side note, we are a C/C++, node.js consultancy but have PHP and .NET developers too (we hired a couple of Wordpress people last year for these projects as well).<p>What we found is that sites below about $4k we didn&#x27;t even consider, $4-8k gave us the most headaches and we lost the most money on, $8-12k went smoother but were a slightly harder sell, sites above $12k were much easier but required a bit more sales effort.  We wound up front loading every Wordpress site with a designer that would do the layout, get client sign-off and collect all assets before handing anything to development.  We did this because one of the biggest issues was waiting for sign-off&#x27;s and waiting for assets etc from clients, but of course now designer hours go up but that is cheaper than developer hours for us and clients.<p>Basic rule, the more the project price increases the more you can say yes to clients and make them happy and still make a living for yourself, the low dollar stuff you just can&#x27;t make clients happy, stay sane and make money. I am sure as an individual it would be better up to a point.<p>One last point, screen clients heavily especially one that compares you to some teenager or person from another country.

If there&#x27;s one thing I&#x27;ve learned, it&#x27;s that if some of the first words out of the client&#x27;s &quot;how much do you charge?&quot;, it&#x27;s an awful contract. They&#x27;re focusing on cost, not value.<p>I don&#x27;t charge as much as top-tier consulting firms, but I do charge more than most freelancers. Clients generally know who I am by reputation or referrals and they&#x27;re happy with my work. For clients who want to nickel-and-dime the contract, it&#x27;s miserable.<p>Still, my favorite was one client who wanted to pay me far less than what I ask and demanded a fixed bid on a small, two-week contract. I agreed and got finished in three days. He wound up paying a lot more for my work than if he had agreed to my rate up front. I charge more, I get done faster. And that&#x27;s <i>with</i> documentation and tests.<p>So yeah, don&#x27;t undercut yourself by charging too little and don&#x27;t hurt yourself by accepting contracts with those who don&#x27;t appreciate your value.

To this day I still don&#x27;t regret that decision, though many would have compromised. My very next contract was my normal rate on a rolling contract. It&#x27;s been less than a year, but I&#x27;ve already earned more than I would have with the year-long contract and the company is very happy with my work.<p>(Plus, I used to sell cars and when you sell cars, you quickly learn that the happiest customers are the ones who pay the most)",1426774162

You&#x27;re just doing it wrong.<p>Best way I&#x27;ve over come the social needs is to work out of a local cafe once or twice a week. Get to know the people there. Learn their names. Make friends. Work on a crossword together.<p>Get a whiteboard. Plenty of notebooks. Take time to journal your day. Thoughts, frustrations, tasks. Explain things to yourself out loud.<p>Reward yourself. Take a walk to the park.

Hallway planning. Making decisions face-to-face in meat-space and not documenting them anywhere. Everything needs to go into an email list or task tracking system.<p>2. Poor communication. If you&#x27;re never available online, refuse too many requests for chats, ignore emails... it can be really frustrating. The great thing about working remotely is that communication can be intermediated by scripts. Set auto-replies, status updates, reminders, alerts.<p>3. Never enough information. When you&#x27;re working closely in a group face-to-face it can be easy to draw consensus on an issue and document it with a single, innocuous task in the task manager and not bother filling in the description, properly rating it, tagging it, etc. Always add enough information so that anyone can come along and take care of it without having to hunt you down.",1426773962

Installing my GNU Octave takes under a minute with yum or apt but hours or days with homebrew or macports.<p>Let&#x27;s also proceed with how none of homebrew, macports or fink is native to Mac OS X, but is some tacked-on thing that most Mac OS X users are unfamiliar with (yeah, most Mac OS X users don&#x27;t even know that a terminal exists or what to do with it). It does not control the entire OS, but only some packages, which are going to be installed in /usr/local or /opt or /opt/local. And woe betide the users, the same Mac OS X users who just learned that their OS has a command line, if they decide to use more than one of these package managers. Conflicting packages strewn all over their filesystem!

There is no stable distribution. If you&#x27;re lucky, you might be able to check out specific git tags of each package, but this doesn&#x27;t work for all packages, and you&#x27;re expected to be updating your entire set of packages pretty much daily if you want to have &quot;support&quot;. The instructions that worked yesterday for getting the software you want may not work today, because all of the packages moved under your feet overnight.<p>Let&#x27;s finally also see what happens when they upgrade from one Mac OS X release to another: breakage everywhere. Some packages may need to be recompiled, some may no longer compile (hello there, LLVM bugs that prevent compilation of GNU Octave), or hours upon hours of copying or moving homebrew or macports trees around during an operating system upgrade.<p>Homebrew and macports are a parody of what Unix package management should look like, and fink doesn&#x27;t have the maintainership that a GNU/Linux or BSD distro has.",1426773887

5114043,comment,5113129,5113780,2,0,shmerl,,,"CD Projekt Red who own GOG naturally distribute their own games through GOG, but note that they as well distribute them through Steam. I see no clear reasons for Valve to restrict the distribution of their games to Steam only. Yes, historically it came with this not very invasive DRM, but there is still no reason to keep it forever, since DRM has no good reasons to be used altogether.<p>I understand that Valve can be already too involved with game producing companies which still have backwards thinking that DRM is a must. But Valve can start pushing them to drop it, instead of being passive.",1359089969

5114031,comment,5110921,5113934,3,0,zmmmmm,,,"> I would appreciate if you elaborated on separating step definitions from dependency definitions<p>As I said, I only very quickly skimmed since I'm busy, I might have overlooked information, and apologies in that case. But take the example from the front page:<p><pre><code>    evergreens.csv <- contracts.csv\n      grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n</code></pre>\nSo now suppose a new requirement comes along - Evergreen is also called ""Neverbrown"" sometimes. It's decided the best way is to convert all references at input so nothing else gets confused downstream. So I need an extra step, now<p><pre><code>    renamed.csv <- contracts.csv:\n        sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n\n    evergreens.csv <- renamed.csv:\n        grep Evergreen $INPUT > $OUTPUT\n</code></pre>\nAdding this step forced me to modify the declaration of the original command, even though what I added had nothing to do with that command. With Bpipe, for example, you say<p><pre><code>    extract_evergreens = { \n      exec ""grep Evergreen $input > $output"" \n    }\n\n    fix_names = { \n      exec ""sed 's/Neverbrown/Evergreen/g' $input > $output""\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThen you define your pipeline order separately -<p><pre><code>    run { fix_names + extract_evergreens }\n</code></pre>\nIf I get contracts from a different source that don't need the renaming, I can still run my old version and I'm not changing the definition of anything:<p><pre><code>    run { extract_evergreens }\n</code></pre>\nHope this explains what I mean, and again apologies if this is all clearly explained in your docs and I just jumped to conclusions from the simple examples!",1359089693

I'm no expert on stocks and am not familiar with the terms, but the principle should be there.<p>Say the ""normal"" P/E is around 15, which means that people think it's fair to be able to recoup the stock's price in 15 years. Now why Apple's P/E is only 10? That's because people think its future earnings will drop (in statistical sense), so that the current price will still be recouped in roughly 15 years. Similarly, Google's P/E is 20+ because people think its future earnings will rise, so that again the current price can be recouped in roughly 15 years.<p>Amazon's large P/E isn't <i>that</i> abnormal if you consider that there are plenty of companies which are losing money yet still have a positive stock price. Maybe they have lots of assets, and maybe people expect them to return to profitability soon.<p>For struggling large companies this can even be a gamble. If you think the company has a 5% chance of returning to glory and earn big, and 95% chance of never earning a profit again, the company can still have a pretty decent expected future earnings in statistical sense.",1359089217

I think you have a lot of good arguments against JVM. There were some moments when I thought it might not have been the best choice as well - for example, Java world is notoriously poor with dealing with child processes.<p>So, I agree, but there are several arguments that it's not that bad after all:<p>- Drake is fundamentally an interactive tool. If you run it as a part of an automated process, all its flexibility is not quite needed. You could have Drake print a list of all shell commands it would execute, and save it to get your automated script.<p>- Most data workflows Drake is good for are quite expensive. Minutes, sometimes hours. Definitely much more than 5 seconds. The reason is simple - if your workflow takes so little time, you're really not gaining much by using a complicated tool like Drake, instead of just putting it all in a linear shell script, and simply re-running everything every time you need it.<p>- Maybe we'll find a good solution like Nailgun and Drip.<p>- Maybe someone will make a Java-code compiler that would create a stand-alone executable out of a JAR.<p>- Maybe Sun will eliminate JVM startup overhead. Or somebody will release a 3rd party JVM without it.<p>- Maybe we'll have a compiled version of Clojure one day.<p>- Other maybes. :)<p>We certainly would support any effort to port Drake into Lisp, C++, Ruby, Python or any language you desire. Porting it into Common Lisp might not be that much easier than to Ruby. We might not consider it ourselves, since the effort will be quite substantial.<p>Does it sound reasonable to you?",1359088570

Ultimately I think the overhead time needs to be removed.<p>If it takes far longer than something like make, that's not necessarily an issue. The key point is making it fast from the user's perspective. As long as it runs in a fraction of a second, I can't see much of a difference between 0.1s and 0.0001s, so I don't think that sort of difference really matters, it's when it gets over 1s that it becomes an issue.<p>Running something like Nailgun in the background may be a good solution, I don't have any experience with it.

This one based on Groovy:<p><a href=""http://bpipe.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bpipe.org</a><p>I agree with your sentiments about the nature of pipelines vs build system a la make. Many many people start down the path of putting the classic DAG dependency analysis as the foundation of their needs when in fact, this isn't so much of a problem in real situations, and is even somewhat counterproductive because it forces you to declare a lot of things in a static way that actually aren't static at all. I've found tools like this completely break down when your data starts determining your workflow (eg: if the file is bigger than X I will break it in n parts and run them in parallel, otherwise I will continue on and do it using a different command entirely in memory).<p>In my experience the problems in big data analysis are more about the complexity of managing the process, achieving as much parallelization with as little effort and craziness as possible (don't see any mention of that in Drake), documenting what actually happened when something ran so you can figure it out later, and most of all, flexibility in modifying it since it changes every day of the week.<p>One mistake that Drake appears to make (again, from my quick skim), is interweaving the declaration of the ""stages"" of the pipeline (what they do) and the dependencies between them (the order they run in). This makes your pipeline stages less reusable and the pipeline harder to maintain. Bpipe completely separates these things out, which is something I like about it.",1359086655

He was head of Team A and another developer, head of Team B, was leaving the company. My friend is going to now head A and B. Team B has suffered over the years because their manager was a ""nice guy,"" and so Team B does not criticize each other very much. In Team A, on the other hand, my friend is critical in a diplomatic way, and members of his team will say things like ""that code is fucking horrible"" to each other if it's bad (followed by specific examples.) The result is that Team A, where people insult each other, has much better code and it's now a challenge to get B to accept even mild direct criticism of code without being offended and an even greater challenge to improve their work without offending them.<p>I think that is a typical story. Good, tight teams are harsh with each other. More skillfully spoken criticism sounds nicer, but the message that the code or the program design is bad is still there just as clearly.<p>A lot is being made of this person's treatment on Twitter. I agree the when presented with stranger's code in a situation where it doesn't matter, it's best to say nothing. But I would expect that if the developer wrote a poor program on the job, for the job, the code should be criticized and the developer should know they did a bad job on that particular task, and they should be shown how to do it better or how to figure out how to do it better. It's only because the developer in the Twitter story had no relation to their criticizers that the criticism can be considered inappropriate.<p>Regarding women in programming, my experience is that the serious ones, just like the serious men, would rather give and get harshly and be counted among the best than to be treated like a child and progress slowly for years.

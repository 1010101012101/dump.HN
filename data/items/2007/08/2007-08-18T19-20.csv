43867,comment,43686,43779,0,0,jey,,,"I agree that it's very important to learn how to navigate the real world, but I really think there's a comfortable compromise between destroying the egos of a significant fraction of gifted kids and sending them to some exclusive school with an artificial environment. I stopped doing homework in the third grade, and scraped by for the rest of my time in the school system. I somehow managed to get admitted to university, but was kicked out after two tortuous years for failing too many classes. I pretty much had 11 unhappy years, from third grade until I got kicked out.<p>I always enjoyed learning interesting things, but school had nothing to do with learning. School was a place you went to maximize your GPA by doing rote busy work, and any learning done was just an accidental side-effect while pursing grades.<p>I never considered myself smart while in school; I saw myself as a worthless slacker with an unhealthy programming obsession. This was the image instilled in me from my teachers, school administrators, and parents constantly chiding me to do my homework. I didn't have the perspective nor the self-image to seek out the kind of help I needed. I also don't think an 8 year old should be expected to come up with theories of why he's failing in school.<p>The theories that the school administration came up with were just based on one observation: Jey doesn't do his homework. Solution: make Jey do his homework. There was no thought given to root causes, nor any experimentation with different strategies. It always just came down to keeping a notebook of homework assignments and making sure I did them that evening. All this bullshit just made me consciously give up on the educational system and write it off as worthless and ineffective.<p>I still don't know how exactly I should have been helped, but a <i>huge</i> problem is that the educators themselves are not aware of the pattern I was exhibiting. It's well documented that many ""gifted"" kids exhibit the same symptoms: extreme abrasive cynicism, defiance and hatred of authority, lackluster school performance, and depression. Part of the problem is that these kids will be pretty rare; gifted kids are rare to begin with, and these kids form a fraction of the gifted population. There should be some effort to educate educators of this pattern, and research on what kind of help works for this population. I think any solution that would have worked for me would've had to capitalize on my high level of curiosity and harnessed it in some way. Assigning more bullshit busy work (a la AP and Honors classes) wasn't the solution. If I had a teacher who engaged me in the material, and presented material as <i>interesting</i> and <i>challenging</i> rather than as <i>work</i>, I think I could've done better. AP and Honors classes seem to make the classes harder mostly by increasing the volume of work. On the other hand, this could just be wishful thinking and maybe there is no strategy that could've made me get through formal education. I don't know, but I think it's worth doing the studies to find out, as I'm not a one-off oddball case.<p>Getting kicked out of university was the first step to recovery for me, and it's the best 'disaster' that has ever happened to me. I'm now a happy person, and really enjoy who I am and what I do. I just wish there had been a less painful way to get here. Going to public school and suffering through the crap did help me develop socially and form healthy friendships, something that I would've completely missed out on if I had been homeschooled.<p>""<i>How do I teach him to learn for himself. To realize that his school gives him a starting point for his education, and not the entireity. To help him end become a ferociously curious individual who gets stuff done, not in some isolation chamber gifted bubble, but in the real world -- omplete </i>[sic]<i> with alliances and politics and emotions and conflicts.</i>""<p>Engage his natural curiosity in the learning process. Make learning fun and a process of discovery, not a process by which a bunch of facts are memorized to appease some authority figure. My dad did this by using the socratic method, and encouraging me to ask questions. Feynman tells a similar story about his experiences with his dad in the first chapter of ""The Pleasure of Finding Things Out"". <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out-Richard/dp/0465023959/ref=ed_oe_p/105-6747349-8129269"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Pleasure-Finding-Things-Out-Richard/dp...</a>

43863,comment,43822,43843,0,0,davidw,,,"And here's why:<p>- It's simply conjecture, as far as I can tell.  It even goes so far as to say ""invariably"", which is a pretty strong word for something with no data to back it up.<p>- It's not particularly well thought out, if I may say so respectfully.  The reason the US has two parties is partly because of how the electoral system works - first past the post causes people to glom together in the center, as per the hotelling effect.  This has advantages (lessens extremism in some ways) and disadvantages (less representative than a broader range of parties).<p>- I would expect a serious article on this topic to delve into other voting systems and their effects on parties, and representation of the spectrum of views held by the electorate.<p>So, this is what we get from someone who is without doubt a smart guy, who has been a member of our community for some time, and if his ""karma"" is anything to go by, is generally respected in his views on startups due to interesting and insightful comments.<p>Just imagine what happens when you start fiddling with those variables - more people who haven't taken part of the community, for instance, and the possibility for low-quality content becomes very high.<p>",1187465934

I agree that any bright kid can figure it out on his own eventually if the desire to learn isn't killed, but think of all that wasted time.  I would much prefer to have my PhD at 20 than at 30 (note: I do not have a PhD - just an example).  I think I wasted at least a decade learning what I should have been taught at school.",1187465524

43856,comment,43799,43799,0,0,danteembermage,,,"I think being an employee and launching a startup are on a continuum of sorts. With a startup you get lots of uncertainty, but lots of independence. There is a job to do, you decide how to do it, and the market is your metric for success, for better or worse.<p>As an employee you have a lot more security (worse case your perfectly steady paycheck disappears for a bit to be replaced by another, maybe smaller maybe larger steady paycheck) but most likely your performance is reviewed by a pointy-haired boss.<p>As a graduate student, usually you get paid a pittance (sometimes you pay for the privilege), have even more uncertainty that a startup (after 5 years or more you may be kicked out; good luck transferring your credits) and your performance is reviewed by a committee of pointy-haired bosses.<p>If you were to actually plug all that uncertainty into a utility maximization problem assuming a risk-averse individual, I seriously doubt it comes out as a good idea for any field, without maybe adding in a variable for ""must prove myself more intelligent than the mundanes with a formal title bestowed by the intellectual aristocracy""<p>Of course most don't really know that going in, and the article was right; once you are on that train it's hard to get off. All of this sounds a little bitter (I used to be a bright eyed idealist; I promise!) but I'm in the midst of slogging through my dissertation and things will be much better when (if) I can finally put on my ridiculous floor length hood.<p>Anyone good with optimal control of vector-valued stochastic processes?

43850,comment,43822,43822,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"There are at least two separate questions here: 1) why does the US have only two major parties; and 2) given such, why do people often pick one and stick with it for all issues?<p>The first has been studied to death.  It has to do with more with how the US government is set up and less with the psychology of its people.  There are other countries with different setups that are not two-party dominant.  One viable way out of such dominance is some form of party-list proportional representation (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_representation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party-list_proportional_represe...</a>) .<p>The second is all about psychology, it most certainly has several components at play.  I posit the most prevalent are attitudes of commitment given the initial choice of party and some form of path of least resistance.<p>The former is common in psychology.  It is a natural instinct to think your group is better as soon as you join it, for whatever reason, even an arbitrary one.  This even happens in psychology experiments when groups are assigned randomly.  <p>The latter reason is simply most people don't research any issues nor do they want to.  They go with perhaps the simplest method to decide, which is listen to what the group told me before.  There is some real trade-off here.  To be fully informed is perhaps impossible.  You need some sort of proxy for most policy issues.  Blindly following one of two major parties (on the other extreme) is probably not the answer either of course.",1187463931

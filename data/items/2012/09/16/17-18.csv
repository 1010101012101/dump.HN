Originally we were talking about DRM as an excuse for piracy; my point was that the inconvenience and restriction is all over the market, not just on an album.<p>That particular case was years ago, and the only time we've brushed with the RIAA.  We're a very small operation and didn't bother to get lawyers involved.  Paying royalties wasn't something we'd consider as the work is only superficially related to the original (by my reckoning), riding the line between parody and fundamental re-interpretation.

4529722,comment,4529314,4529566,4,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I've seen the same thing. I really never could get into LinkedIn. I have an account and I rarely if ever use it. I don't see how it's social. That is to say, if it's about making connections in terms of career opportunities then I can use Facebook or Twitter to do that though I'll admit it's not exactly the same experience but still doable. The problem, for me at least, is that I'm not constantly looking to make career changes or network in those terms as often as I'd socialize on another social network. Much of my professional connections come from doing business with people offline and in person meetings. For me, LinkedIn is good for when someone meets you for a second then looks me up later on LinkedIn to sell me something or connect in a way that usually feels forced and spammy.<p>But that's my personal experience. I have a handful of friends who take it seriously and say its quite helpful for networking so maybe my experience is not normal. I'm curious about others. Has LinkedIn served the purpose it set out to serve? I also wonder if your location matters. For instance if you're in the SV area I'm betting people are more likely to use it more often and find it useful but what about those in other parts of the country/world? I'm in Chicago, the third largest city in the US (should be number 2 but LA seems to include its suburbs as part of the city for some reason), and I just described my experience with it.

Android isn't, but it is true that the main competitor is Apple which doesn't let you use their OS, so Android's position as a licenseable OS is pretty dominant. You could say that's not Android's fault though.<p>Second, in the Microsoft case, Compaq could ship BeOS but it would then have to lose all of Windows. With Android, if you ship Aliyun then you can still use core Android, but you do get that code later, and you also lose the ability to use the proprietary stuff like the app store and maps and so forth.<p>I agree these are not necessarily huge differences, there is still something to be said for Google having a tremendous amount of power here and is using it.

I believe it's important to give every child a solid foundation to build on as they grow and develop their own specialised interests. I believe that doing that efficiently and effectively requires, and probably always will require, a systematic and professional education system at school age.<p>Of course it's good for children to have other options and to take advantage of whatever unique opportunities they might have, but if even 10% of children interested in a subject started asking elementary questions about it on Internet forums the way they can in a classroom, the forums would collapse. Likewise, if someone wants to educate their own children in subjects they know well or to hire excellent personal tutors, I'd be the last person to deny any parent the right to do what they think is best for their child, but most children aren't lucky enough to have parents so academically gifted or wealthy and so won't have those particular opportunities.<p>In fact, it seems to me that the only conceivable way to fix that, so that relying on a specialist teaching profession wasn't as fundamental as it is today and every child could enjoy that kind of personal attention, would be to educate the previous generation who are now parents to a high enough standard and then make sure that they had enough time to spend with their children that they could take on more of the role that school teachers play today.

Once you start doing -a and -o, then people can inject confusing values for variables, making it impossible to parse:<p><pre><code>  foo='!'\n  bar='2'\n  [ ""$foo"" = 1 -a ""$bar"" = 2 ] # -bash: [: too many arguments\n</code></pre>\nSince test runs a subprocess, it can't tell the difference between data and arguments. Instead, you should do something like this:<p><pre><code>  foo='!'\n  bar='2'\n  [ ""$foo"" = 1 ] && [ ""$bar"" = 2 ]\n</code></pre>\n(This also has the advantage of being way more legible.)",1347815551

4529575,comment,4529213,4529406,10,0,DavidAdams,,,"I'll chime in here to say that indeed we don't treat our brightest minds quite well. For one, by trying to let no child be left behind, and raise average test scores, our schools are spending most of their time trying to raise the bottom half to the standard. Kids who can easily pass the tests are left to languish. And I mean this literally. My son has been relegated to the corner of the classroom to spend hours poking around in the meager classroom library while the teacher worked intensively with the laggards.  Programs for ""gifted"" kids are unpopular with parents because they seem ""elitist"" so schools have to go to crazy lengths to obfuscate them and make them as low-profile as possible. You're unlikely to even hear the term ""gifted"" in a school nowadays. They have to use euphemisms like Early Learning Program.  Even in high schools where it finally becomes politically workable to sort the smarter kids into AP classes, the ""best"" schools use those classes and the bright students as a factory farm of AP credits earned, which raise the rankings of their school system, and make it easier to justify continued budget increases. So rather than encouraging critical thinking, writing, and creativity, they're teaching to the test.<p>I actually agree with many of the facts that the article lays out. I actually don't think that there's much point in getting heartburn about the US's standing in the ratings, because a lot of the ratings are probably useless or easily-gamed metrics. And it's critically important for US interests that we make it easy for the world's best and brightest to continue to immigrate. The big problem with the article is that, as other readers point out, it's a self-defeating argument. The reason that our poor education outcomes don't matter is that we import the top performers from other countries?  Well, it's a good thing that we import the top performers (in a selfish way of seeing things). But that's beside the point.<p>I think that one of the factors contributing to our education challenges is that we have a large and diverse population, but we also have naive notions of what equality means, and we too often think that correlation equals causation. Going to college correlates with success later in life.  That's because smarter, harder-working kids tend to go to college. It does not mean that sending dumb lazy kids to college you'll make them successful. If you send dumb kids to college, you end up with dumb kids with no college degree and $40,000 in student loan debt the incurred before they dropped out. I'm using the term ""dumb"" to make a point, but the truth is that there's nothing wrong with not being cut out for the academic life. In fact, if you are prepared in childhood to be determined, hard-working, and creative, you can become a very successful person without having ever been an academic type. I spent three years doing carpentry, and I got to know a lot of tradespeople who did important things, enjoyed their work, and lived comfortable middle class lives, and sent their kids to college. But we're allergic to the idea that people are cut out for different kinds of life purpose because some people are more academically oriented than others.",1347815030

It doesn't even begin to solve many of the problems that plague Americans who aren't already privileged in some way. Here in Chicago, the internet doesn't help all the black kids who don't even have safe schools to go to, much less good ones.",1347815029

3790770,comment,3790378,3790563,10,0,tzs,,,"NOTE: I don't think employers should be allowed to ask for special access to a candidate's Facebook page. I'm not arguing for Facebook access below, but rather I'm arguing that I don't necessary think current law can be construed to prevent it.<p>I'm not convinced that theory is correct. There's a difference between asking a prohibited question, and acquiring the answer to a prohibited question incidental to something else.<p>To give an obvious example, you can't ask about race and sex, but the employer is going to find out that information at the face to face interviewer by simply observing the candidate.<p>Or consider criminal background checks, which are allowed in some states. A criminal background check might turn up information that makes a candidate's sexual orientation, national origin, or religion apparent.<p>I don't think that an employer would find themselves in legal trouble for doing a criminal background check that turned up that information, because they weren't doing the background check to acquire the prohibited information.<p>As a practical matter, though, even if it is legal to look at Facebook, it is a bad idea. Suppose you do not hire a candidate, and the candidate sues claiming that you didn't hire them because of their marital status. During discover, the plaintiff finds some emails between employees containing disparaging remarks about people of his status.<p>If you have not looked at Facebook or otherwise snooped into their private life, you will offer as part of your defense that you did not know their marital status, and so could not possibly have discriminated on that basis. Even if you do have some managers who dislike people of the plaintiff's status, they could not have acted on that dislike in this case.<p>If you have snooped, then you no longer have that defense. You are in the much less desirable position of having to argue that your people (who have been caught disparaging people of plaintiff's status) did not use that information, even though they did have access to it.<p>I can easily see this being the difference between a plaintiff win and a defendant win.",1333411091

This is getting tiresome and unbelievable - I don't know of any startup that has nothing but ""A-player type work"" to do. Almost every plausible startup has some work that will be comfortably addressed by a range of abilities and the idea that you're going to stuff your startup full of absolute super-stars (and do well as a result) is just posturing.<p>I am also not entirely sure that someone whose references are, I dunno, busy doing actual work or ""on holiday"" deserves to be penalized with respect to someone whose references are all hanging around in their office with nothing to do but promote the living shit out of each other in some kind of mutual admiration society.<p>Speaking from experience, I have seen many such cliques of utterly mediocre, self-serving people who would unhesitatingly tell happy stories of how wonderful everyone in their clique was to anyone who asked - even if a more conventional response from further up the management chain would have given a very tepid review of the actual performance of said people.<p>Finally, if you're going to contact a bunch of people out of the blue, adding self-promoting line about your blog is not appropriate.

Reference checks were <i>incredibly</i> important, as a startup's chances of success, are, on average, very much correlated with the strength of the team in a variety of areas.<p>First, obviously, we were looking for red flags.  We had ways of phrasing questions designed to get people talking (esp about negatives).  Also, more importantly, we were looking for names/contact info of other people who worked with the person we were checking that weren't on the reference list they provided to us.  We'd do the same thing with customer references.<p>Second, we didn't know most of the people provided as references.  A random stranger's opinion is interesting, but not that useful, especially when phrased in terms of ""good/bad"" or ""exceptional/not exceptional.""  What was more valuable was to find out what <i>kind</i> of person we were dealing with, which is something that you really can learn from a few random strangers.  For example, in past lives, has the CEO been an effective salesperson?  Does s/he need a strong COO because s/he tends to let details drop here and there?  The line of questioning went something like: ""If you were going to build a team around this person, who else would you want on it?  What qualities would the other team members have?""<p>In other words, references are just another data point, and I believe their value is not a binary determination of that person's ninja-rockstar-astronaut-whatever-ness, but a more nuanced read on that person's abilities as they contribute to the team overall.",1333409665

Its fun, useful, and it clicked.<p>I couldn't disagree more with your disagreement. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are abstraction of things observed in many places and studied in one place so you can apply it to everywhere. Eigenface is simply an instance of linear space dimension reduction, whose implementation, by the way, is based on eigenvectors' connection to SVD and covariance matrix. Eigenface won't help with Taylor series definition of matrix exponential, nor solution of linear ODEs, nor Jordan canonical forms. Can anyone say those are not important topics of eigenvalues and eigenvectors?<p>If you truly want to understand something, there is no shortcut. You have to dig deep, look at and learn related topics, think hard about how and why scientists developed the subject this way. It takes time and concentration, a lot of them. Then you will gain something, and you need to keep at it to master it. No one said knowledge is easy, especially deep knowledge.<p>>You could draw a picture of a circle, emphasizing the line of the circle >as the boundary of the set. The invertible matrices are the interior of >the circle, and they complement the singular (non-invertible) matrices >which are represented by the boundary of the circle.<p>This demonstrates the pitfall of facile visualization, because the suggestion is wrong. There are dense sets with no boundary. The simplest example I can think of is rational numbers on the real line. It is dense on the real line, yet between every two rational numbers there is an irrational number, and between every two irrational numbers there is a rational number.<p>>But more importantly, the teacher should first explain why this might >be useful to know in the most concrete way possible, whether its >theory behind an applied technique in engineering or a lemma used >for an important abstract theorem (no handwaving - tell what's >important or significant about the abstract theorem).<p>This is easier said than done. At best, it is impractical; at worst, fantasy. Who is going to spend a week of lectures to explain one application in a possibly obscure engineering field. What about the fact no everyone is from an engineering department.<p>Sometimes theorems are useful for proving other theorems and then for proving other theorems.  Gershgorin circle theorem is mainly useful for proving bounds about eigenvalues. That is it. I couldn't motivate more than that. It has application in numerical linear algebra, but it amounts to another proof and you need to go pretty deep in matrix analysis to appreciate it.<p>>Students (American or otherwise) who are willing to just put their >heads down and drill rote symbol manipulation are doing themselves a >disservice - it generally does not lead to much insight or >understanding of what they are doing (though it may in the >exceptional cases of very smart students), especially as the math gets >more advanced. Moreover, being adept at calculating is not useful in >the age of computers. You only need to do a calculation once (as an >algorithm in a computer program).<p>This I strenuously disagree. Math, like every human endeavor, requires practice and lots of it. If you cannot recall a pertinent theorem at will, then you will not be able to use it to prove it. You don't have to remember every theorem for all time, but when you need it you better. And practice does develop insights and understandings, which I can personally attest to. Advanced math especially requires a familiarity with basics, for no computer will prove for you a countra-positive.<p>I am opposed to rote learning. Who isn't? Specifically, I am opposed to Chinese teachers' mind-numbing deluge-of-exercises approach. All the proofs are nothing more than bags of tricks and they seem to take special delight to confuse students by not explaining things fully. I so detest that mindset. The U.S teachers are much better. There are good teachers and bad teachers, of course, and I suspect college professors can be a lot better if they actually put the necessary time in. American textbooks are leagues ahead. But one thing I have learned since is that in the end you have to remember the theorems and tricks because: THEY ARE MATH.<p>>More important is to gain insight and understanding into the nature >and limitations of the subject matter. Then the student is more likely >to recognize the cases where it can be applied after they're done with >the plug-and-chug problem sets at the end of the chapter (which >plague even advanced math textbooks in the form of boilerplate >theorem proofs). Of course, simply showing how to plug-and-chug is >easier for teachers so they praise obedient students who are easily >motivates and ask easy questions.<p>This I agree in general. It is after you gain insights and understanding can you innovate and advance. It is remarkable how many Ph.D.'s never master their fields. But it is hard and time consuming. My ideal of math textbook is Richard Courant's ""Introduction to calculus and analysis."" It is a perfect blend of mathematical rigor and insightful intuition. It is sad that I didn't have it as my introductory calculus textbook. It used to be the standard intro textbook in the West.<p>I suspect, and I could be wrong, the reason you blame teachers so much is that they didn't teach deep enough and you are smart enough to realize there is more. They had to be ""easy"" because it is already hard enough for some students. And this may be the ultimate problem with public education: it needs to teach the everybody but it can only do so by dumbing down the curriculum. That and it is expensive to teach but we want to do it on the cheap.",1333409170

Not sure why this is.<p>Anyway, it's if you still want to submit a response, that would be awesome, and the survey form is available at the following url:<p><a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEdlOGdORkJsamJ6VjFNN0UwTDY1YXc6MQ#gid=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dEdlOGd...</a>",1333407930

3790557,comment,3790450,3790450,24,0,michaelochurch,,,"This deserves a downvote.<p>Horrible idea. Most companies have their policies of not giving references either way. Lawsuits over good references (for people who turned out not to be good) have occurred, and even though the probability of a plaintiff victory is low, who wants to deal with that pain in the ass? Most people are fine saying that someone was essentially decent and worked hard, but aren't going to go out on a limb to say that someone who no longer works for them is ""EXCEPTIONAL"".<p>Also, what if the person doesn't remember his boss's email or gets it wrong? What if his boss is three companies away by now? Lots of false negatives here.<p>I think reference checks are not essential for junior hires-- not having references is a warning sign, but I'd take a chance and decide fast on someone if necessary <i>if</i> he wasn't going to be in a managerial role-- but I'd require references from past subordinates (2 per company) from anyone being hired into a managerial role.

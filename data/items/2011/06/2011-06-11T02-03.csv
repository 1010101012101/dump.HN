In quantum mechanics, there is no such thing as a point mass.<p>But in any case, the answer to your question is yes. Black holes have 3 quantities: mass, angular momentum, and charge. So, yeah, you can charge up a black hole by dropping charges into it and the charge would be visible to the outside.",1307761136

Consider the future: Every email, document, website, video stream becomes an extension of the sender or author and your computer is reduced to a dumb view-only device.<p>Also, there's the argument that the current state is (people who pay, who are hassled by DRM) and (people who don't pay, who avoid the DRM hassles).Criminals get the better experience, people who pay get things they practically can't backup and use on other devices or sample to quote, even in jurisdictions where they have those rights.",1307760180

I can see why they still offer the non-pro 13"" macbook (low end / entry level), and the larger pro models, but the 13"" air and the 13"" pro offer a potentially confusing choice to customers, and I would think this is a bad thing -- the ""i can't decide so I will get neither"" syndrome. Perhaps apple is waiting until they get thunderbolt onto the air before killing off the 13"" pro.<p>In addition to segmentation, I would think it is advantageous <i>to apple</i> to prefer 'sealed' machines like the air, ipad, iphone, ipod, etc. These sealed machines put you on a faster upgrade cycle, because you have to refresh to replace or upgrade the ram/hard-drive. I would think this forced early upgrade cycle, along with the lean towards more utility computing, would move apple in this direction.<p>I am sure apple has historical metrics to support their offerings though, having had similar models offered in the past. So I am probably just 'talking out my ass' on the market segmentation issue....<p>note: edited for formatting",1307759925

There is no reason the cord actually needs that four inches of horizontal spaceits just poor, thoughtless design that results in a poor user experience. Whoever designed the lamp should have put as much thought into the cord as they did into the rest of it, but instead its just an afterthought.

2643033,comment,2641426,2641426,6,0,skue,,,"It needn't be a shower. Meditation, yoga, and some forms of martial art work just this way. Each of them trains you to accept discomfort without reacting to it.<p>There's a Buddhist story where a student asks a teacher about the secret of correct practice. The answer: ""Don't move."" Meditation hurts. A lot. Your legs ache and often fall asleep, your lower back gets stiff. But you're not supposed to move. Over time you do become more flexible, but more importantly you learn to accept the pain without needing to fix it. It turns out that if you can focus on the moment, the pain isn't so bad - it's actually the fear of the pain lasting into the future that causes you stress. As Shunryu Suzuki (founder of SF Zen Center) said: ""Don't move. Just die over and over. Don't anticipate. Nothing can save you now because you have only this moment.""<p>But there's nothing uniquely buddhist about this... My Berkeley tai chi instructor loves to have students hold postures for extended periods to the same effect. You move past this point where you think you're going to collapse and suddenly find a way to relax further into the form. And any serious yoga student will tell you that holding yoga poses for them accomplishes the same thing. Sounds like the cold shower had a similar effect for Jason.<p>It's not macho, magical, or new agey - it's just a practice - though one that may seem odd in our can-do, fix-it-now culture. As we grow we learn that not every problem can be fixed, and devoting time to practices like these can teach you to be okay with that.",1307758659

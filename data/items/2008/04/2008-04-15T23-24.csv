164687,comment,164578,164578,0,0,edw519,,,"I have had people come to me with seemingly complex problems requiring what they thought would be complex solutions.  Oddly, the elegant solution was often a gross simplification of the complex problem.  Often because I just didn't understand the complexity.<p>Example 1.  A shipper can only fit 1200 boxes in a 40 foot trailer.  The material is so light, they can never make weight.  The boxes must be delivered to depots throughout the United States with no more than a 3 day window either way.  What box should go on which truck?  The customer thought they needed sophisticated algorithms to provide an optimal solution.  The simple solution: a screen where an educated user can drag boxes (or groups of boxes) to trailers and can drag trailers to destinations.  The computer did very little, but the difficult business problem turned into a ""game"" that employees fought each other to ""play"".<p>Example 2:  A cloth manufacturer wanted a linear algebra solution to determine what products to mount on their mills and where to set the knives.  The simple solution: A screen with all customer orders and key data about each order (size, weight, width).  Everything on the screen was sortable and switchable.  Again, an intelligent user could ""play a game"" to schedule the mills almost as well as any automated algorithm.<p>Example 3: A distributor wanted to know what to buy, when to buy it, and what to put on sale to move slow inventory.  He wanted an expensive ERP program.  The simple solution: A screen with all supplies and demands that can be mixed, matched, sorted, and selected in many different ways.  Again, an intelligent user can ""play"" with his data and then confidently make decisions.<p>The ""real"" bonus of all these ""simple"" solutions?  The person drove the decision and felt in control of the situation.  No more blaming the computer for the results.<p>My suggestion:  Slow down.  Even stop.  Ask, ""How are we making this too complicated?  What simple little thing could I do to get just part of the way there?""  You may surprise yourself and find that the simple little idea IS the solution.",1208303626

I suspect it won't get crazy popular around here, unfortunately.<p>Creating a sustainable business has been my lifetime dream, and hearing day after day after day about quick ""exit strategies"" on news.yc has been very depressing: if you're so eager to ""exit"", why are you in it to begin with? Pure greed would be an honest answer, I suppose.<p>This is why admire Jobs so much: while he certainly cares about the ""money problem"" he has remained so obsessed with Apple, with his baby, throughout his entire life. There is no ""next big thing"" for him.",1208303386

I'm a little surprised it took this long, but that could just be a reflection of Amazon being the first to get it mostly-right for a maturing market.<p>I'd be more interested in their thought process in terms of ""OK, we can offer <i>this</i>, but it's too risky to offer <i>that</i>, and a waste of time to implement <i>that</i>...""  That could be enlightening.",1208303025
164683,comment,164487,164487,0,0,DocSavage,,,"It'll be interesting to see if readers like the system, because I imagine there's a number of problems with the metrics and then establishing a good personal weighting function. What about books that have mixed perspectives, 1st and 3rd person?  Most of the writing style metrics would be far less significant than interesting plot and good characterization.  Let's say someone liked Jurassic Park.  Chances are they liked it <i>despite</i> the slow start, yet the structure analysis apparently recommends other books partly on a criterion (""slow start followed by fast pace"") that should be <i>negatively</i> weighted.<p>Pandora's music DNA matching might be more successful because listening to music seems more visceral and less cognitive than reading books.  The dimension space of book recommendation feature vectors could dwarf that of music and even movies.  I wonder how the system would do in the Netflix challenge by turning the analysis on the production screenplays for the films.",1208302946

164676,comment,164578,164578,0,0,iamwil,,,"For me, it's simply something that's learned and cultivated.  As far as I can tell, my creativity comes from a sense of curiosity in the world around me, a mental flexibility to entertain odd possibilities, and a broad scope of knowledge.<p>This sort of question is asked of cartoonists a lot, and usually, they'll make up some sort of fanciful answer, like ""I like to drink coffee with cocoa butter"".  In reality the very best ones have cultivated a sense of curiosity about edge case situations.  They make it a habit to notice odd things, and things that don't quite make sense when you think about it.  If you read Bill Watterson's (Calvin and Hobbes) Tenth Anniversary Edition, he talks about this topic, and his answer is that he mainly just sit there and lets his mind wander in front of a blank piece of paper--which to others might look remarkably like goofing off.  Hackers in general are the same way, but they get curious about systems and how things work instead.<p>A mental flexibility to entertain possibility helps as well.  Often times we're boxed in by our experience, and what we know, as hard as we try to break out of it.  When radio was invented, it was asked why you'd want to say stuff to no one in particular.  And when the TV came out, the inventor of the radio dismissed it.  Here, I think it helps to know how to daydream and let your mind wander.  Or when you approach a problem outside your field think of how to solve it using something outside of your expertise.  The only person I've ever read about to overcome it was Richard Feynman.  Apparently, he had the ability to start from basics from any problem and work his way from the bottom up, aware of his assumptions.<p>Lastly, what's called creative is often just taking two old things that don't usually go together, and getting them to play well with each other.  When you know about lots of things and have a broad scope, you start to see how things are interconnected.  In school, I liked math, but other kids complained about how they'll never use it.  It wasn't until after college that I started to see that the segmentations of subjects is done so that students don't get confused and have discrete chucks of info to learn.  In reality, every academic subject is interconnected somehow, and when you have the broadness of scope with deepness in some of them, you'll be able to make connections between things that are related, but not usually thought of as being so.  If you can make those connections, people will usually dub you as being creative, when you don't think it's as big of a deal yourself.<p>Being creative is a habit you get into.",1208302322

It's obviously a huge center of commerce. Find an active forum. Make it easier for someone (or a group) to do something they're talking about doing there, complaining about, etc. Advertise it there in the forums. That's how I launched RefreshThing.<p>2) Observe existing behavior in others you can relate to. Improve upon it, make it simpler, show them how it should be done online. Double points if that behavior is something they're accustomed to doing offline and are crawling online where you can show them how to run.<p>Or try picking an idea you have right now, developing it (a little or a lot) and then solving the problem you don't know it has until you're at a stage where you can see that about it.",1208301684

The situation was even worse since we had to log so many hours a week due to billing hourly. The biggest difference with me is that when I was first put on the PIP, it looked like I was going to successfully complete it. So a 4 week process was extended to 12 and then I was given a new PIP that was impossible to fulfill[0] and the micromanagement was increased to ridiculous levels. I didn&#x27;t even try to improve at that point and was fired a week later. No severance, no benefits, no nothing. They were nice in that they gave a glowing recommendation that didn&#x27;t mention any of this. They said we parted ways amicably and that it just wasn&#x27;t a good fit.<p>It seems the recurring theme here is if your employees are slacking, more micromanagement isn&#x27;t the answer. Either give them a reason to get excited about coming to work or fire them. The PIP process is an orwellian farce. The only saving grace is I bet most companies that use them don&#x27;t actually know they don&#x27;t work.

If a company shafts me for $10, I&#x27;m not going to spent the thousands or millions necessary to prove the error. I&#x27;ll just write it off and be less trusting next time. But if a company can screw each American out of $10, they&#x27;ve made $3.2 billion, which is a great incentive, and also provides for fantastic legal defense. Net result: a lot of people have bad experiences, reducing consumer trust and making innovation harder.<p>State action is also often problematic. It&#x27;s not bad at some things. But especially at HN, we don&#x27;t want to encourage this as the primary means of market regulation. Governments are slow to move and risk averse. It&#x27;s easier and safer for them to over-regulate, favoring incumbents and limiting innovation to what they can be persuaded to permit. (See, e.g., the car market.)<p>Class action, on the other hand, fills an important gap. Companies know that they can&#x27;t just screw everybody without risking a big lawsuit and a big payout. But plenty of problems get solved without government having to intervene. Class action basically allows for a &quot;forgiveness, not permission&quot; model for regulation. As long as your customers are happy and you treat them fairly, your risk is low.<p>If class action stops working as a way of redressing grievances, we&#x27;ll see a lot of people agitating for increased government regulation.

The offer was quite ridiculous, but after doing tons of work and becoming a key element I was able to negotiate again my compensation, and now I have north of 1% ISOs and 165k salary. My role is heavily technical, I built most of the core at the beginning and now I spend my day leading a few teams in the company (the company size is 35 people).<p>The main problem is that I feel this inner conflict that is deepening every day: I can witness that my productivity and my contribution to the company is huge, but I don&#x27;t get any satisfaction out of it because I feel like my slice of the pie is way smaller than what I think I deserve.<p>Also, I feel very lonely in this matter, because all my coworkers are either more junior, less talented or less ambitious than me, and so for them the simple joy of working on interesting problems and getting an equity of 0.0x % is more than enough.<p>Some solutions I can think of might be:<p>1) Get a better title (VP of engineering): this is going to be absolutely hard. The founders are extremely stingy and so are the investors, and I&#x27;ve been repeatedly told that in order to aspire to a VP role for a company with our traction you need to have a previous curriculum, which obviously I don&#x27;t have since this is my first startup experience (I&#x27;m 28).<p>2) Leave: this one would make sense if it wasn&#x27;t for the ISOs. If I had to leave and exercise my vested share of options, I would have to pay an incredible amount of taxes (because our valuation increased) for a liquidation event that might happen years from now, or never.<p>3) Ask more money/equity: knowing myself, this would make me genuinely happy for about a year or so, and so might be reasonable. The problem is convincing the founders (and the investors) would be very draining, since I&#x27;m already the highest paid technical person.<p>Have you ever gone through something like this?<p>Thanks for reading.",1446327818

Note that this incentive is completely independent of the relationship between the spouses, because of the way marital assets are divided after a no-fault divorce.<p>Even in the happiest marriage imaginable, if there&#x27;s any income/wealth disparity, the spouse on the low end has a massive economic incentive to initiate divorce for a payout.<p>This is why I said in my first post that marriage is an inherently broken institution, and needs serious reform.

One of our next shared goals is making the Scala standard library cross-compile on Scala and Dotty, by the way.<p>I&#x27;m personally more excited about Scala 2.12, though! The new compilation schemes for lambdas and traits are much more efficient in many ways (bytecode size, runtime performance and binary compatibility) than the old one, forced on us by Java 6&#x27;s limitations. Both schemes were prototyped in dotc and developed in parallel, as part of our ongoing effort in aligning Scala with Dotty (actual convergence is still years away -- in the mean time, Scala versions will gradually adopt ideas that are proven in Dotty).<p>As always, evolving the language carefully is a feature in itself! (I understand it may seem too slow to some, but most users are happy with this pace, we think.) We have a responsibility to our fast-growing user base to not pull a Scala 2.10 every 18 months ;-) We will, however, keep moving forward, as witnessed by the ongoing deprecation & modularization in the standard library.

The core theory, which really resonated with me and stuck with me, is that we do not consist of a single mind. Our consciousness is a set of smaller subsegments (he calls them agents) that work (generally) together.<p>If you think about the fact that looking at our brain you can see the evolutionary differences compared with other organism,s this starts to make a lot of sense. We have these different systems that have varying ages, with natural selection putting more pressure to develop a new system or enhance an old one, and the brain winding up almost like a tree trunk with different rings. It makes sense these smaller chunks do their own thing then &quot;talk&quot; to other parts. we even have language referencing it, &quot;I&#x27;m of two minds about XYZ&quot;, and diseases like schizophrenia and hallucinations we trace to various parts of the brain not recognizing each other or not working properly together. We have studies that seem to indicate some decisions being made before we consciously think about them.<p>About a decade ago I really started to feel like I&#x27;ve begun to recognize different &quot;aspects&quot; and understand why I feel the way I do by understanding this theory.

The sellers might be big enough to cause the paper value to go down temporarily, but it would only hurt the sellers themselves.  And obviously, in nominal terms the cash would enter right back into the economy once the coal was purchased.  So there would be near-zero negative impact to the overall economy from the asset sales.<p>&quot;This puts the value of the US coal around 20 trillion (ignoring a few factors like present value, etc., but this is around the total value). To purchase the land right from owners would cost somewhere around this amount, give or take an order of magnitude.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s hard to get exact numbers, but the total value of US coal is many many times higher than the value of just the mineral rights.  The legal right to mine $50 worth of coal is obviously worth way, way less than $50.  In other words, you can wipe out a huge amount of coal usage with smartly bought mineral rights, especially, like the story alludes to, if you buy them in such a way as to be inconvinient to everyone around you.<p>I think the basic idea is sound.

94931,comment,94840,94903,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I love how Bloomberg is setting up his campaign ahead of time by teasing the news about <i>maybe</i> running. I'm really hoping he jumps in as a third candidate after the primaries and puts his personal fortune to use.<p>Not sure why, I just kind of like the guy. He seems like a problem solver and not a publicity solver.",1199479575
94929,comment,94882,94882,0,0,evhead,,,"I don't know which is the right market, but I have a suggestion on approach: Choose an application/market that you, as founders, personally find appealing. E.g., if you're not designers, don't do an asset manager for designers. It will be way harder to get it right, because you have to make product decisions based on guesses and feedback, rather than intuition. It will also be less fun.",1199479052

94924,comment,94765,94776,0,0,Tichy,,,"I just wonder, on a practical level, how will people organize their music. If all they ever did was purchase individual songs, how will they go about ""just listening to music""? Just playing one song will be unsatisfactory, so they need some kinds of playlists, or random shuffle over their whole collection. I have witnessed friends going the random shuffle route lately...<p>Creating a huge amount of playlists seems like (too) hard work.<p>Edit: OK, if music is free as in no purchase necessary, a whole new host of applications comes to mind. I think creating playlists will still be a valid task. Essentially it is already happening today, in the form of internet radio stations? Creating a playlist is basically what a radio station provides?",1199477318

It did in Germany, I know as much.<p>The news item was actually interesting for me, because it was the first time I watched a video of Obama. Also, I think he is under special scrutiny, and his speech seems to refer a lot to that, doesn't it? At least I thought the ""change"" meant that there might be a black president of the US after all?<p>Not trying to argue that it belongs on news.yc, but so far news.yc did a fine job filtering out the most interesting mainstream news (including the best xkcd cartoons, apparently).",1199476827

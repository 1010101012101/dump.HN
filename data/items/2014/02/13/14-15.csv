He called it that because it usually coincided with the founder finding out they had a baby coming, but it also worked that way for BeardBrand, for example.<p>2. Most of the &quot;successful&quot; interviewees on podcasts state they started back in 2009, so 5 years later is now (2014). 5 years seems to be the point at which entrepreneurs have been steady long enough that they start to either a) look for the next thing or b) start sharing with other people what they know.

I totally agree that Python build-ins are often faster, as in this case.  However, there are times when no build-in is available, and you have to use a custom function (usually from C).

7231630,comment,7230930,7230930,1,0,betamike,,,"Very cool. If you have a recent enough version of Redis, you may want to move away from doing the lookup using KEYS and move to SCAN (<a href=""http://redis.io/commands/scan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://redis.io/commands/scan</a>). KEYS will work for a while, but with a large enough DB it can become a very slow operation so it&#x27;s not typically recommended for a production system.<p>Also, just curious, I see that the original url is encoded in the key, so the key is &quot;<short>||<original>&quot;.  Since the key is already a hash, it seems that you could eliminate having to scan over every key in Redis by making each key be only &quot;<short>&quot; and having an additional field in the hash for &quot;original&quot;.  Then a lookup becomes simply an HGETALL (if you need to get the &quot;count&quot; field, otherwise just an HGET for the &quot;original&quot; field).

7231629,comment,7226372,7229857,4,0,exelius,,,"Choice of development language is realistically more of a business decision than a technical one. With the proliferation of REST APIs, there are no longer really any technical hurdles to using any language.<p>Scalability can be an issue, but honestly business scalability is a problem for most businesses long before technical scalability is. Ruby and Python are awesome, but it can be hard to scale a company with one of those languages because it&#x27;s hard to find good programmers who know Ruby or Python. It&#x27;s much easier to find good Java or C# developers.<p>At this point, given all the work the Apache foundation has done to make Java awesome, I don&#x27;t really know I would consider another language from a business standpoint. Sure, from a technical standpoint Java isn&#x27;t that exciting; but it&#x27;s easy to scale, easy to hire for and relatively standard across a number of platforms. Java code is also relatively easy to maintain since it forces you into certain design patterns.<p>There are some domains where this wouldn&#x27;t hold true (and data science is definitely one of them -- you&#x27;ll have an easier time hiring a machine learning expert who knows Python than Java) but that&#x27;s really just technology.

7231628,comment,7230820,7231411,1,0,jnbiche,,,">In the specific example above, however, I&#x27;d try to reduce that overhead by going even more C-style and allocating an array or two so you avoid the overhead of individual instances and instead have one Python object for many elements.<p>How exactly would you avoid the overhead of individual instances using a ctypes structure?  Sure, you can allocate an array very easily, using Point * 10 and then putting your instances in the array.  In fact, you&#x27;d have to do this if you wanted a collection of these structs.  I&#x27;m pretty sure that this array is stored continguously, but you still have the overhead of the Structure base class.  How are you proposing to avoid this in ctypes?  Or were you referring to cffi?<p>If you really want to be serious about large, performance-intensive arrays in Python, it&#x27;s time to pull out numpy.  It actually would fit well here.<p>Re: cffi, I do love luajit but I&#x27;m not a huge fan of its C interface. I&#x27;ve not used cffi, but it seems to be inspired by, or at least shares a lot with, luajit&#x27;s C ffi.  Which means you have to basically paste all the C header files into a string in your Lua or Python code to use the corresponding shared library.<p>The beautiful thing about ctypes is that you don&#x27;t have to declare all the function prototypes and type declarations when you use a shared library.  You simply make sure to feed the functions the properly typed variables, and store the returned value properly, and it just works.<p>As a result, I find ctypes a lot easier to use for simple optimizations.

They are terrible because they teach what buttons to click to make Microsoft Word 97 display text in bold, rather than the ability to think about problems; arguably they teach <i>against</i> thinking about problems (like &quot;how do I make text bold?&quot;), in favour of rote learning and hand-holding. Likewise, teaching kids which punctuation marks to press in Notepad to make a HTML element turn green is also a terrible idea, because it&#x27;s focusing on the code.

What Dexter doesn&#x27;t realise, probably because she&#x27;s not spent a significant amount of time programming, is that <i>code is for people to understand</i> and only incidentally for machines to execute. If programming was only about satisfying the computer, our keyboards would only have two big buttons: 0 and 1.<p>Now, this was essentially true in the early days of computing (punching cards) but we&#x27;ve progressed beyond this.

I thought the same before I really got into home roasting.<p>My perspective is that, if you only consider &quot;price&quot; as your differentiator, yes the green coffee beans are cheaper. If you look at the Sweet Maria&#x27;s site, they are selling just-roasted Rwandan coffee for $15 per pound [0]. They sell the exact same green beans for $6.35 per pound [1]. But that&#x27;s deceptive because (a) Sweet Maria&#x27;s has a $15 minimum purchase (so you can&#x27;t buy just 1lb), and (2) the $15 roasted coffee includes shipping. I just checked and, to ship 3lbs of coffee (minimum order of green), would cost $11.30. So my &quot;out the door&quot; price for 3lbs of green is $30 which makes it $10 per pound. If you compare that to the $15 &quot;out the door&quot; price for their roasted, I&#x27;m saving $5 per pound. Sweet.<p>But how long will it take you to roast those beans? Two adults probably go through one pound a week. So you saved $5 by buying online, but it takes me about an hour a week to roast a pound of coffee using my Behmor. Even if it only took me 30 minutes, would I trade 30 minutes of my leisure time for $5? That&#x27;s the part that people don&#x27;t consider enough, I think.

One hour per week roasting/managing is significant to me. If I could find a place that would sell me just-roasted beans in 5lb or more bags, it might be worth it. I paid $300 for the Behmor and I pay about $8-$10 per pound shipped for green coffee. If you said, &quot;Scott - here are some great tasting beans that we&#x27;ll roast for you right before we ship them, and they are $12 per pound&quot;, I would sell my Behmor. At this point I&#x27;ve learned most of what I&#x27;ll learn about roasting coffee - now it&#x27;s just a matter of spending that hour a week.

Lots of libraries are exposed to Python, and you can expose more either by compiling bindings (see Boost.Python) or using ctypes.

Your Python is slow for the same reason that your Bash and your C and your Javascript and your VBA are slow: you haven&#x27;t profiled enough, you haven&#x27;t thought long and hard with empirical results in front of you about where your program is spending its time, your program is improperly factored and doing work in the wrong order, or perhaps you should just throw some hardware at it!",1392300649

I take it there&#x27;s no way of mitigating that in a lower layer without adding some leaky abstraction or general overhead to the network? So, for example, (speaking as someone who knows nothing about these things) you could add some sort of handshake along the lines of:<p><pre><code>    ntp server sees request from 1.1.1.1 (spoofed by attacker)\n    ntp server goes to 1.1.1.1 to check that they really sent the request (sort of ack type thing)\n    1.1.1.1 comes back to say that it&#x27;s an uninitiated request\n    ntp server discards similar future requests for some time\n</code></pre>\nObviously that would require more toing and froing, along with more white / black list tracking etc. Then again, can&#x27;t all machines have sensible defaults in their firewalls to stop them from participating in such attacks?<p>Is this not an issue for TCP?<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s because UDP doesn&#x27;t do any checking / acknowledge stuff by default?",1392300636

He was thrown a raw RSS feed and had to figure out what was in it and how to extract the relevant information.<p>> also, i hear a lot about the value of regexes - be careful, this is a web centric view. regexes are a very limited parsing/recognition tool and outside of web development - they go unused for most such problems - they either aren&#x27;t powerful enough or add a needless layer of complexity in the general case.<p>NLP makes heavy use of regexes for tasks where GLR parsers are overkill or where we have to fix character encoding or other such data noise.<p>> good luck though. given more time and practice you will learn to eat these interviews up then spit them out with you rejecting them for making a poor first impression on you as a prospective employer... interviews work both ways after all.<p>Exactly what we need to do, teach to the test.

We&#x27;ve done that at one of the startup&#x27;s I CTO for.<p>On the backend, we eliminated the entire multi-tier stack we&#x27;ve come to know and love from the late 90s. The database, application server, caching server, and authentication server were collapsed down into a single executable.<p>We dropped TCP, and went to UDP + NaCl-based crypto. This in turn changed how we did session management and logins (we only target mobile devices), and allowed us to gain further performance by bypassing the Linux kernel entirely, and talking directly to the Ethernet hardware. Our wire-to-wire latency for a UDP packet (without any processing, just heading through the LuaJIT app framework) is ~26 nanoseconds. We measure the entire request/response time in less than 10,000 nanoseconds for updates, and frequently, less than 3000 nanoseconds for reads.<p>Nanoseconds! Today&#x27;s hardware is crazy efficient, but yesterdays software architectures waste it all.<p>For caching, we employ a database library (lmdb) that uses the file system and memory mapping for all data, a lot like Varnish Cache does. We can service reads without a single malloc() call. No more memcached.<p>Finally, the entire system is built around an event streaming approach (see Disruptor/LMAX). For that to work, we wrote our own cross-platform Core Data alternative on the client, and for this particular application (a social network), the end result is that the user experiences ZERO network latency for everything but search.<p>Everything is local by the time the user is made aware of it. For updates like making a post, we make it happen instantly on the client, speculatively, and eventually the update makes it&#x27;s way to the server and back, and then on to everyone else. The user doesn&#x27;t even need a live network connection to post, and &quot;offline&quot; usage works as expected.<p>And also (since this is a speciality of mine), our object graph syncing is multi-device from day one. Lots of projects (e.g. Vesper) struggle with that one. We didn&#x27;t bolt it on, it&#x27;s a fundamental property of our data model and overall system.<p>After collapsing the crypto, database, and authentication, we were able to introduce object capabilities that requires zero memory lookups, instead of the usual RBAC, which in my experience is difficult to implement efficiently and hard for people to manage.<p>And because we have our own network protocol, and are targeting native clients we control, we can easily do client-side load balancing. We use consistent hashing to contact read-only servers (that also handle crypto), mostly so we can spread out the bandwidth without having a crazy expensive load balancer. Thanks to our custom database/app server, we can service all writes on a single machine, although like LMAX, it&#x27;s designed to run three in parallel, discarding the results of two of them at any given time.<p>Point is, there are HUGE gains to be made when you (a) understand the whole stack, (b) have the skills and understanding to rewrite any part as you need to, and (c) have the guts to ignore 15 years of received wisdom on how to scale an app and are willing to collapse layers down in pursuit of speed and simplicity.<p>It may be harder, but the payoff is enormous. I did all of the above myself in just over four months, including building a cross-platform app framework for iOS (porting to Android in March), and the app itself.",1392300493

There are many that are now writing lots of Go and JavaScript.<p>I don&#x27;t think people &quot;move on&quot;, they just also start using more than one programming language.  A few years ago Python + C was all you needed.  Now you need to deal with JavaScript if you want it or not, often there is Ruby involved because of deployment tools, there is more and more Go code, Java became popular in the same community etc.",1392300287

I was talking more about people that recognize science as a good thing and tend to follow what is presented as scientific facts, but aren&#x27;t specifically trained in it. The problem I see is that some scientists are taking data that points toward a conclusion, even if it isn&#x27;t well supported or rigorous data and talking as if it is absolutely certain and proven. This degrades people&#x27;s trust in scientists, and likely science in general.

Yes, you could use tuples instead, in some cases, and get performance characteristics comparable to C structs. Often this is not an option though, and you would still have to use classes or dictionaries. There are many scenarios you could conveniently implement in C using structs, that would end up as an ungodly mess in Python if you would implement them using nothing but tuples.<p>Just as a thought exercise, try to come up with a way to represent and manipulate an hierarchical, mutable C-structure with 20 fields, using nothing but tuples in Python.",1392300007

The qualm I have is that it's currently at the intersection of gaming and exercise.  I would be surprised if gyms wanted this since gym goers would feel silly, until you've got something more immersive (think VR system with tracking of goals, sprints and durations etc.).

1389088,comment,1388689,1388966,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I wouldn't mind sharing more, in some cases.  However, we do not have a -- codified -- social convention for how such information can and cannot be used.  When I can lose health insurance, or a job, or -- in other countries -- potentially my life, as a result of public sharing, I'm going to avoid it.<p>Facebook grew to dominance in good part because it initially provided people control over their sharing.  Statements now that they ""give users (complete) control"" over how their information is shared, are disingenuous.  Lies, actually.<p>You can no longer hide your profile picture.  Many of my friends have replaced theirs with photos of their pets, random graphics, or whatnot.  This occurred after profile pictures -- <i>even pre-existing profile pictures uploaded and selected at a time when they could be limited to e.g. just friends</i> -- were forced to be public.<p>As someone who has had a family member selected and stalked based on appearance, I can tell you how troubling this is.  Not to mention all the potentials for discrimination of various sorts.  Yes, you can change your picture, but can you ever change the old version that Google and other sites cached before you caught on to the site's change of its visibility?<p>You cannot hide your friends (unless this has changed in the latest changes, for which I've not yet been prompted by the site).  Even more insidious, there is a workaround that allows you to remove the ""friends"" widgit from your public profile page, but which does nothing to limit the availability of your friends list through the invisible, much less apparent, and much more commercially oriented API's.<p>Why should I worry about all this?  Well, this article provides a decent, if thin on specific incidents, summary:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1387385"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1387385</a><p>Many things are ""easier"" when you are young and don't have much in the way of obligations (particularly in U.S. and some other Western/""advanced"" societies).  Or when you are a ""superstar"" and many people seek your attention and participation -- and are willing therefore to overlook some ""eccentricities"".  A lot of people, however, are not in either of those positions.<p>Look how much trouble the U.S. has just trying to reach some consensus on how to deal with pre-existing medical conditions and health insurance.  This despite the fact that the majority of the population seems at least to profess an aversion to, more so an abhorrence of suffering.  And despite the fact that one can pay into insurance plans for years and years -- what might under other circumstances be interpreted as building up a considerable, as yet unrequited investment in the system.  And yet ultimately be denied coverage due to a job loss, or just to the greediness of a system designed to place executives and shareholders first.<p>Comment on Facebook on your sore back or that RSI, and while you may receive some sympathy or even helpful suggestions in the short run, our current society and legal system does nothing to prevent that data from being mined and then used one day e.g. to deny insurance coverage.<p>Why are some people upset about privacy?  Because some people have paid attention to the discriminatory uses and misuses of information, either in their own lives or in others', contemporary and historical.<p>The novel physical aspects of the Web can seem to cast this in terms of a new, unexplored context.  But much of the underlying situation is neither novel nor surprising.<p>Personally, I am actually not a shirking violet in terms of sharing personal information, even with strangers. (Sometimes, in fact, it is easier to share things with a stranger; also, the novelty of getting to know someone is an often very enjoyable experience.)  But I do NOT want it absorbed and ensconced into a medium that works mercilessly to associate it -- publicly -- with my identity and continues to hold it over my head for the rest of my life (in ways that literally threaten my well-being).",1275158902

1389081,comment,1388913,1388913,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"Air transport is one area where technology has seemingly stagnated, or even reversed.  Airliners seem pretty much the same as when I was a kid.  You certainly don't get to your destination any faster.  There have been improvements -- aircraft such as the 787 are built with light and strong composites; the A380 is the biggest airliner ever; low cost carriers have driven down prices; you can get WiFi on certain flights.  But you're not going any faster, or traveling any more comfortably.<p>Compare that to the period from 1955 - 1975.  Jets entered commercial service, displacing slow and noisy gas-powered propeller planes.  The Concorde made its first flight in 1969, entering service shortly after.  The US had its own supersonic airliners on the drawing board.  There were even proposals for hypersonic transports.  We ended up getting stuck with cosmetically identical jetliners and a series of unmanned hypersonic test vehicles.  Remarkable feats like SpaceShipOne are few and far between.<p>Aerospace technology relies on inspiration.  ""Because we can"" used to be a large motivator.  It's tough to get around economic or military reality, but at the same time it's sad to see fewer mind-blowing engineering achievements.  Most of us couldn't afford a Concorde ticket, but I bet there were plenty of people who still thought it was damn cool.",1275158534

In one configuration, node size, location, connectedness and proximity to the core of the graph would signify a comment's relative importance and ""page-rank"". The ability to respond to and ""link"" to multiple other comments would be useful here. Another would be a more standard tree-based visualization of the comments in time, but without the misleading vertical ranking of root nodes. Another visualization might be a straight serialization in time, similar to mailing lists.<p>I imagine the nodes to be sort of bouncy, physicsy bubbles that can be nudged around, and that the view can rotate in three dimensions and zoom in and out to focus on specific subthreads.<p>Other times I think that's <i>way</i> too heavy-weight a solution, that it would be confusing, that it might not actually solve anything, and that we do pretty well with the threaded comment trees we have now.

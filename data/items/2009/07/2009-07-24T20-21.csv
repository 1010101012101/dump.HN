722379,comment,721612,722107,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"The bassoon is in kind of an interesting position because it's used in basically every full symphonic score ever, but uncommonly played. Most universities will have two to five bassoon majors at any given time. There are tons of less commonly used instruments but they are usually played as a side project by another instrumentalist. A lot of bassoonists actually double down on the saxophone which is used rarely in the symphonic context. Myself I alternated between Bassoon and Tenor Saxophone, which was my other love.<p>The instrument itself plays differently from anything else in an orchestra. It really is a bizarre instrument. And it's an absolute riot to play. The double reed, woody sound, and enormous four-octave range make playing the bassoon a really unique endeavor. The instrument is built out of tune with itself. It takes a certain kind of... distinctive individual to really connect with the instrument. Ask any concert musician - they'll nod and grin when you mention those odd bassoonists.<p>The closest instrument I can think of in terms of rarity and unusualness is the French Horn. It's really the odd duck of the brasswinds. French hornists are a little more common than bassoonists, but then most instrumentations call for a few more horn players.<p>Man, this has been a trip down memory lane.

Maybe I have a short attention span, or maybe this is just the same tired old argument.<p>During the Unix wars nobody gave a crap for standards, and these only came to be when Unix was starting to get some serious competition from non-unix operating systems.<p>The problem is, relying too much on standards leads to stagnation, and it is Linux that has prevented unix from standardizing itself into irrelevance.<p>I'm mostly a Linux guy, I admit, but I have worked, and still do, with other unixes (the ones spelled with all caps) every day and I must say that although they are unix (and I like the unix way of doing things), they are also a pain to work with and not ""standard"" at all (just put AIX, Solaris and IRIX side by side, and try creating users, managing ACLs, and so forth). The only standard thing about them is the lack of the small features that Linux admins take for granted and that make one's job so much easier (the so called GNUisms).

Mine was off on pace and distance constantly.  It's in the garbage now.<p>The way I calibrated it was I ran on a treadmill at a constant pace for 1 mile.  After I'd get pace results that were off by a minute sometimes, and mileage results off by 1/10th of a mile.  I calibrated it like 20 times before giving up on it.<p>That might not seem a lot, but to a serious runner it is.  A 6:00/mile pace is far more grueling than a 6:30/mile pace.  I ran a 1/2 marathon with it and Lance Armstrong congratulated me for finishing when passing the 11.5 mile marker.  Uh, another 1.6 to go dude.  If I let it pace me it would have ruined the race for me.  Fortunately stop-watches and mile-markers still rule all.<p>You can look at reviews for it on Amazon.  Many had the same experience I did.  People still buy them though because people like stats.  ""You finished a marathon.  Achievement unlocked!""  etc...<p>It's more for new/amateur runners to the sport.  They don't care so much about accurate pace and distance.  Just having something say ""You did good!"" makes them happy.  Running for 30 minutes is difficult enough for many, without worrying about accurate stats.  And heck, if that gets you running, by golly go and buy one!  The more people taking care of their bodies the better!  :)<p>--------------------<p>The idea behind the uploading of your workout data online is really cool though.  If it was replaced with a GPS unit, and the cost stayed affordable, lots of problems solved for runners like me.  Garmin has a nice, albeit bulky, runners GPS wrist-watch unit, for $300...<p>--------------------<p>The data saying ""5 uploads and you're hooked"" probably has a lot of more ""serious"" athletes like me dropping out before hitting the 5-upload mark.",1248466702

And personally, I am more flexible on concepts like child labor and safety standards. Subsistence farming is hazardous to your health too, and people ought to be able to make a choice on what's best for their future.<p>With one caveat -- as long as there are well-enforced laws that protect the rights of workers to organize or protest, and a strong local government that isn't powerless with respect to foreign companies, that can direct investment to make permanent upgrades in local conditions. Taiwan obviously got it right, somehow -- I don't know the history. Perhaps you can enlighten me, but maybe it's due to their democratic assembly and their strategic relationship with the West.<p>Other places in the world seem to be getting a worse deal -- often due to the deficits of the local government or culture, I'll admit. But globalization also seems to move a lot faster than it did, with less commitment to the host countries. If it takes literally just weeks to set up light manufacturing somewhere else that's just a little bit more desperate, how does a place like Cambodia hold onto the little gains they've made so far? I'm not an expert in that country either but I hear they've had serious problems with that.<p>Anyway, I have to bow to your superior understanding of the realities, but I just don't think that my microwave ovens or cans of cola had to be paid for with so much misery.

He does it in his garage so for about three months there's a thin layer of flies over everything in there and enough get into the house to make it sufficiently annoying.<p>2) Pressing is hard work and the amount that he makes, just about every other step in the process is very tedious.  Part of that is because he refuses to use anything resembling modern equipment.  It's all hard labour.<p>3) The temptation to turn the wine into Brandy always looms.

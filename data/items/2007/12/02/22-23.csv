Farmers in Africa have a much harder time penetrating our markets because of these.<p>Considering one of the first steps past subsistence farming is selling produce to global markets, these restrictions are a very big hurdle to development.<p>The free market advocates, the ""experts"" derided in the article, have the most coherent ideas on this topic.",1196634357

Incorporate the following quote:<p>""They call it the Jesus phone, so naturally I assumed it would have a little bit of Jesus. But after playing with it for a couple days, this phone has significantly more Jesus than even I expected.""<p>The title should be as follows:<p>""My iPhone has pretty much replaced my penis as the default thing I reach for when I'm bored""<p>That should probably be good for at least 3,000 Diggs. You could probably even use a markov chain to randomly generate the rest of the text based off previous reviews. I doubt most diggers would be able to tell the difference. ",1196633816

Even the best minds have to go trough the shit that undergraduate education has become, and their potential will be underdeveloped because they are not pushed to do their best, leading to a lot of lost potential (and a possible degradation of scientific work and standards?).<p>abossy said in another comment: ""I wonder if a more competitive school would be 'easier' because I would be pushed to excellence instead of striving for excellence in spite of a standard of mediocrity.""<p>I absolutely feel his pain.<p>- Master Student in Computer Systems Engineering at SDU",1196633374

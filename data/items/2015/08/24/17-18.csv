There are many factors affecting variables like appetite, subjective energy level, energy used through spontaneous movement, many hormones and so on.<p>But, if you&#x27;re an individual trying to decide what works and what doesn&#x27;t in a field where the popular media is full of misinformation, I have a really hard time seeing the position that counting calories is _completely_ unhelpful.<p>> &quot;Pitting will-power against metabotically driven hunger ends, in the long-term, with biology winning every time.&quot;<p>Yet, awareness of calories in vs calories out can be a way to plan your strategies, to know from the start whether a given strategy can even work or not, from the point of view of physics. Many people try things that this simple knowledge would rule out. A lifestyle change that does not result in a negative energy balance will not cause someone to lose weight, period.<p>It&#x27;s also a framework where you can discover what works for yourself. Does lowering carbs vs lowering fat affect your appetite at the same calorie level? How does burning an extra 500 calories through exercise make you feel vs lowering food intake by that amount? These are valuable things to know, again for an individual on a personal quest, not talking about making public policy or population science.<p>Some people find an intuitive lifestyle change that successfully allows them to lower their body fat and keep it down. Bravo. Some people also succeed more mechanically with conscious calorie control. I have a hard time seeing the argument that both of these can&#x27;t be useful and successful.",1440438986

Gaining/losing weight is easier/harder for different people for different reasons, but ultimately a person&#x27;s BMI is within their control.  To pretend that they are &quot;victims&quot; of some unavoidable outside force misses the point entirely.  Obese people do not deserve to be mocked, shamed or blamed for their problems, but one cannot pretend that the power to fight obesity lies anywhere other than with the obese person.  People don&#x27;t &quot;develop&quot; or &quot;catch&quot; obesity, they become obese by allowing body fat to become too large a portion of their body mass.  This problem may be harder to tackle for some people than others, which isn&#x27;t fair, but that&#x27;s life for you.<p>>I&#x27;d be perfectly content with a switch to flip, and have no guilt nor shame in flipping it.<p>As an overweight person, I completely agree!

And the pre-processing of things like flight iteneraries has stuff like the flight confirmation code easily accessed.<p>The bottom line is I can see the path to a mobile device I talk to, and it talks back, much like an executive secretary, to keep the important bits in order so I can focus on other things.

That&#x27;s a large burden. It&#x27;s perhaps time this becomes a legal matter rather than purely a user-choice matter.<p>In society we have all kinds of protections for people that make a lot of sense, that take away individual responsibility. For example, even if a person wanted, you&#x27;re not allowed to become a slave, it&#x27;s simply not allowed. Even if a person wanted in most of the developed world, you&#x27;re not allowed to work for less than minimum wage, or in a toxic environment. Similarly even if a person says &#x27;I don&#x27;t mind if people are misogynistic towards me at work, or discriminatory, I just want this job no matter what because I need the money&#x27;, that&#x27;s not allowed, either.<p>Similarly, I think it&#x27;s time we start to think of legal protections again this level of spyware. We shouldn&#x27;t put the burden of acceptance on individuals when you&#x27;ll have millions of people who&#x27;d prefer to live in a world where they don&#x27;t have to use this software at home or at work, but have no choice (particularly at work), and thus accept spyware because the loss of their job works as a blackmailing force, just like in the above examples.<p>That doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m saying there is no legal place for software like this under any conditions. But the notion that it <i>can&#x27;t be turned off</i> is insane. Even &#x27;on by default&#x27; is a step too far, but now Windows is saying whether you use windows 7, 8 or 10, we&#x27;re spying on you, and you can&#x27;t turn it off, and if you tamper with our software manually you&#x27;ll fail because we&#x27;ve hardcoded it. That&#x27;s not acceptable and my point is, it shouldn&#x27;t fall upon users to boycott such harmful parts of software they paid for (in the case of Windows 7, half a decade ago).<p>It should fall upon the rule of law to prevent this and allow at least an opt-in, a choice, a choice that isn&#x27;t &#x27;use any Windows product, or use no Windows product&#x27;<p>If OSs were more free like say, the automotive industry, I wouldn&#x27;t mind as much.

It&#x27;s not something I think about everyday to check, just like checking the weather at 6am in the morning. Sure if my life was perfect I would but it&#x27;s not. Google does these simple tasks for me and turns bad days into better ones but not adding on another 45min on the way home when I have already had a long day.<p>2. airports/new city? I wake up in the morning google already knows if my flight has been rerouted, the potential for delay due to weather, and whatever airport or new city I&#x27;m in, it tells me where there is to eat and what to do. Sure there are plenty of additional apps I could download if I was in the &quot;in crowd&quot; in san fran and knew the best ones for each city, but I&#x27;m not, and usually I&#x27;m busy so I want to have 15 highly ranked restaurants give me the best selection.<p>If I&#x27;m there on vacation sure I&#x27;ll put more effort into finding off the beaten path places but honestly google now is helpful for people distracted with their everyday life.<p>3. At one point I was with visiting my boyfriend while he was on a business trip in Flagstaff. Google obviously knows we are dating. My phone was dead but the reminder for my flight came up on his phone. Sure there is a separate &quot;app&quot; just for that, per airline and then I could share my flight with my bf but WHY? Google already knew where he was, knew I was most likely flying there to visit him and gave him updates on my schedule 24hrs before hand all the way until I got home safely, as well as myself. Easy, one less thing to worry about in 2 peoples busy working lives. Once I send him my flight info, google picked right up on it. No &quot;extra&quot; apps needed. Didn&#x27;t have to think to remember to do this.<p>4. I use google keep notes like an OCD freak as well so its nice to have what I&#x27;ve decided it important to me as well as things that I&#x27;d like to check if I remembered but google already has it staring back at me on my screen when I wake up in the morning or walk into a crowded airport or think I&#x27;m having an normal ride home.<p>I also (and for most young kids in big cities) have a busy social life and go to lots of music shows, but I go to alot so I don&#x27;t remember the time date and price of every one so it&#x27;s just nice to have if I don&#x27;t do the same thing everyday.<p>It makes driving home, navigating airports, remembering to wish your college roommate happy birthday on the way to your rerouted terminal and also knowing you have an extra 10minutes to go to jamba juice that you didn&#x27;t know was around the corner so you don&#x27;t have to live off airplane food.<p>These are things that make my day alot nicer, alot more functional.

Butter from pasture-fed dairy cows is a great source of fat-soluble vitamins, particularly vitamin K.  The commodity butter you are likely to get from mainstream brands is not.  As it is an animal product, what you get out of it depends a lot on what you put into it, and there is good reason why most livestock-based companies do not want to make an issue of their husbandry practices.<p>There is even some evidence that indicates that not only is pasture-fed butter better than trough-fed butter, but that regularly rotating the herd to a different pasture every N days is even better.  But when the press talks about butter, all butter is the same.<p>And let&#x27;s not get started on alcohol... I believe that the current story is that somewhat less than one normalized drink per day is now healthy, and that it does not even have to be red wine.<p>Do your vegetables have too much oxalic acid, biological contaminants, or residual farming chemicals?  Is your fish farmed, or wild-caught (using slave labor)?  Is this meat processed just a little bit, or so much that it is now unhealthy?  Is this &quot;pink slime&quot; stuff okay, or not?  Is this tomato bred for flavor and nutrition, or for uniformity, ease of processing, and visual appeal?<p>So it&#x27;s not obvious.  It is, in some cases, intentionally obfuscated, to protect business interests.<p>Most people do have a vague idea of what is healthy, and what is not.

I&#x27;m not sure where it comes from, or if it is a different variety than spinach grown from seed.  Sure, the unhealthiest serving of spinach is probably going to be better than the healthiest serving of gummi bears, but I don&#x27;t typically eat <i>just</i> one thing when I eat.  That spinach might come with a sandwich attached to it, or salad dressing, or barbecued pork, or feta and phyllo.<p>So it&#x27;s not always spinach versus gummi bears.

I literally have no idea which of those two lunches is healthier, or even if the <i>same lunch plate from different restaurants</i> will have a similar healthiness profile.<p>The only way I could possibly keep track would be to have a digital assistant that is able to automatically evaluate everything I might put in my mouth <i>and</i> give a recommendation for a healthier alternative that isn&#x27;t so far from whatever it is that I <i>want</i> to eat that I will ignore it.

They get fat because their endocrine system begins gearing up for hibernation, and telling their fat cells to kick into overdrive growing.  They will literally burn muscle while simultaneously gaining fat in this stage, like all hibernating mammals.

Serving sizes are also often deceptive as they don&#x27;t clearly indicate the macronutrient content for an entire package (as they do in many other countries).  Sure, 7g of sugar per serving seems ok for cookies, until you realize that&#x27;s every 2 in a box of 20 and you&#x27;ve eaten the whole thing (70g).<p>Most preservatives and artificial sweeteners are actually fairly inane, despite scary-looking ingredients lists.  What you should be worried about are the cheap forms of sugar, refined carbohydrates, hydrolyzed oils/trans fats (which are thankfully declining in popularity), and HFCS/cane-sugar-based drinks which average 32-68g of sugar per bottle.<p>All of these things cause a condition called insulin resistance, which leads to obesity and eventually if untreated, acquired diabetes.  Insulin is the hormone that extracts glucose (energy) from carbohydrates (food), and turns it into a source of energy for your cells.  [It is well established scientifically that the aforementioned &quot;watch-list&quot; all spike your insulin levels, and that instability in your insulin levels relative to blood glucose is bad.](<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2995635"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2995635</a>)<p>In layman&#x27;s terms, these things make your body release disproportionate amounts of insulin compared to the amount of food you&#x27;ve ingested, and this has a few downstream effects; a large spike can make you feel intensely hungry (why people say &quot;empty&quot; foods make you eat more than you would otherwise), and most importantly insulin becomes less effective at transporting glucose.  That&#x27;s the beginning sign of Insulin Resistance Syndrome, and its correlation to obesity is well established.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s because of the composition of processed foods, not any dangerous chemical additive (with a few notable exceptions) that most long-term complications arise.<p>Looking back 30 years you may be correct, but looking back 500 to pre-industrial diets, you&#x27;ll notice sugar was less prevalent in the food of most Anthropocenes, and fiber was much more common.  The sugar lobby of the 1900&#x27;s is largely responsible for its GRAS status and current abundance.<p>These days we mill our grains into cereals, removing any traces of fiber/micronutrients and inject large amounts of liquid sugar into most beverages for &#x27;flavor,&#x27; having the compound effect of up-regulating what we perceive to be &quot;sweet.&quot;  Both of these things make our bodies release far more insulin than is needed to extract their energy, making us hungrier disproportionally to caloric intake and setting the stage for a diabetic future.<p>To the unconscious consumer, these forces are silent and automatic.  For as little self control as people may have, I personally can&#x27;t place sole blame on the individual when I know the entire chain of supply to be rigged against their nutritional best interests.",1440436461

Its big flat steel sides reflect lots of radar signals, and the search area, while large, is (compared to the pacific and indian oceans) rather small. I don&#x27;t doubt that anyone looking for this ship would find it fairly quickly.<p>The problems with MH370 were twofold. One - initially nobody actually knew where it was. The search area was HUGE, and for the first few days there was much less information about the aircraft location. The eventual search area was selected based on quite detailed analysis of the satellite pings the aircraft sent. This took time. It took 9 days for the search to even start in the southern Indian Ocean. Even once they&#x27;d figured out roughly where it had gone down, the search area was still astronomically big. Two - aircraft wreckage isn&#x27;t nearly as reflective to radar as a ship. An aluminium panel floating flat in the ocean will have a very similar reflection profile to the surrounding water.<p>I think you need a fourth option. Large countries definitely have a technical advantage, but the military still has to obey the laws of physics. Large budgets and no legal restrictions probably put military technology a generation or two ahead of comparable civilian technology - it&#x27;s better, but it&#x27;s not magic.",1440436421

Adults can always turn off activity reporting or remove kids from the Microsoft family at account.microsoft.com/family.<p>By default, unless you log in and explicitly disable it, Windows 10 collects kids&#x27; usage activity <i>and uploads it to Microsoft&#x27;s servers</i>.

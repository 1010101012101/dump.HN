I&#x27;m still for body cams, though-- the inherent trustworthiness of the police&#x27;s word must be ended permanently, and there is only one way to make that so.<p>Eventually the video from body cams will be scraped for ID information, which can then be cross referenced with the cell phone data they pull from the local Stingray or dustbox. They&#x27;ve got your name, your face, your digital communications, and your physical location tracked over time, controlled at the metro level, all without any kind of warrant/oversight or consent from you. Pair this with an ARGOS equipped drone, and you could easily show a live map of where &quot;problematic&quot; individuals are. Reaching that point is a totalitarian panopticon, and 100% enforcement of the law becomes possible, criminalizing everyone.<p>At what point does the complex of this technology constitute a search/seizure that requires a warrant? At what point does this complex of technology constitute an unreasonable search or seizure? When does this cross the line into being illegal or unconstitutional, if we aren&#x27;t already there? I mean, there&#x27;s no legal participation needed to follow me around all day via a sky camera, snoop my communications all day for content and metadata, note all of my purchases, note all my interactions with others, note my general state when in view of police body cams, and generally scrutinize me 100% of the time.<p>I would also take this moment to note that these issues are separate from the NSA-related dragnet, though they are indeed likely to be integrated into it eventually. The body cams and police technology are about physical surveillance and enforcing physical compliance and &quot;orderliness&quot;. The NSA is about enforcing and surveying ideological and norm compliance.",1439485192
10055598,comment,10053422,10054521,0,0,trevelyan,,,"Assange has never been found guilty of a crime or even charged with one. The British legal ruling was not over guilt or innocence but simply over the bureaucratic definition of a crime. If the Swedish government reprinted the exact same request with your name on it, you would also face extradition without the ability to challenge the request on the grounds that its allegations are not factual.<p>This is the key point that apologists for Sweden miss. The prosecution could have charged Assange and got an extradition warrant that way. They didn&#x27;t because doing so would have required a court filing and granted Assange rights to a speedy trial and freedom from indefinite detention. Interviewing Assange in London was equally impossible -- once it was done the Swedish prosecutor would have been legally required to either charge Assange or close the case. And charging the case would have required a court filing, etc. etc.....<p>Arguing that Assange would have been found guilty of rape also shows a lack of knowledge of the case. Despite what you seem to believe (who told you this?) the woman in question was not asleep and has in fact made statements contradicting your claims and accusing the authorities of railroading her. I do not personally know what happened that evening, but her description is striking in showing Assange complying with every request she made. The only possible breach of consent lies in the possibility that Assange broke a condom deliberately, but this is apparently contradicted by forensic evidence which shows the breakage was due to wear and tear. Add on the woman&#x27;s affectionate treatment of Assange both before and after the night in question, and the way her change in behavior followed her realization that he was sleeping with someone else, and it seems rather obvious that while Assange may have been a cad the rape allegations simply don&#x27;t hold water.",1439485183

Apple is one of the worst offenders - particularly in light of their previous commitment to usability - but sadly not the only one.<p>My personal pet peeve is when both Apple and Google started removing colour and textual labels from the icons in their interfaces.  Fortunately textual button labels are back in Gmail, but Google Docs and Aperture are still hampered by black-and-white-only icons.  Surely it is obvious that it&#x27;s going to be harder to quickly locate the desired icon if they are all black-and-white silhouettes instead of coloured illustrations?<p>(I can appreciate in the case of Aperture that there might, very occasionally, be cases where the coloured icons could affect the user&#x27;s perception of the colour of the photographs they are editing.  A global UI-desaturate switch would be more useful than enforced B&W icons, however, since colour is still used in other parts of the UI.)",1439485163

10055594,comment,10054225,10055482,0,0,pc86,,,"> <i>[affordable housing] offers lower returns than low density luxury housing.</i><p>Not true - as a RE investor you&#x27;re always looking for around 1% of the property&#x27;s value per month as rent ($1 in rent per month for every $100 the property is worth). Much below that and you&#x27;re not going to have sustainable cash flow.<p>It is much, <i>much</i> easier to get $1k per month in rent from five $100k properties than it is to get $5k per month from a $500k property. Especially in areas with high property values (California), you&#x27;re lucky to break 0.4-0.5%, which is not going to support any meaningful level of investment, only speculation. Which in turn helps drive a cyclical market, which helps pump up the higher end home values, which further hurts cash flow, etc etc.<p>Lower value housing may offer lower returns in an absolute sense but as a far as ROI it&#x27;s much easier to make it on the lower end of the scale.",1439485127

10055592,comment,10054225,10055291,0,0,nilkn,,,"Keep in mind that with a mortgage you&#x27;re still renting -- you&#x27;re just renting money instead of the house. I know this is a simplified view, but some of your points (e.g., profit for the landlord) have equivalents for a mortgage (profit for the bank, via interest). Also, you&#x27;re going to be paying for maintenance in either case. In the case of owning it may not be literally baked into your mortgage payment, but that doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re not going to be responsible for repairs on your own house.<p>Also, keep in mind that a landlord isn&#x27;t entitled to profit just because they&#x27;re attempting to make a profit. It is entirely possible (and it does happen in reality) that a certain rental market is such that the landlord will not be able to turn a profit or may in fact even lose money. Being a landlord is just like any other business -- it can fail.<p>Finally, rental markets are often <i>just different</i>. Here in Houston, I could not buy an apartment like the one I rent for the same price that I pay. There aren&#x27;t many condo buildings for one thing, and the ones that do exist charge exorbitant monthly maintenance fees. These fees would bring the monthly cost of owning such a condo to about $500-$1000/month more than what I currently pay in rent. At the same time, any townhouse or SFH that I might buy which is larger than what I rent is naturally going to cost more -- often times significantly more. In other words, the rental market sometimes has options that <i>don&#x27;t exist</i> in the for-sale market. (The opposite is of course true as well.)",1439485122

It would be someone like the national data protection regulator or European authorities, acting on behalf of the population as a whole, and they would probably be looking at the actual behaviour of Microsoft and whether it violated data protection laws. If Microsoft attempted to argue that weasel words in their terms permitted their behaviour but the evidence showed that in the real world users didn&#x27;t know or understand the implications, I doubt that would work out very well for Microsoft.

Moreover, so far no-one I&#x27;ve talked to seems to have found any good, concrete reason to upgrade, other than the not-really reasons like &quot;it&#x27;s free&quot; and &quot;it&#x27;s the new version&quot;.

You are absolutely right there is an excess supply of positions and an insufficient demand for those positions. However, that is a general statement that can be narrowed down I believe.<p>While in the entertainment industry there is a very small supply of jobs for high dollar actors and actresses, there is a excess supply of positions for small walk on, non-speaking characters with insufficient demand for those positions. People don&#x27;t want small, low paying, non-speaking, uncredited acting positions. They are willing to pay an agent to try to get them the small supply of high paying acting positions that they want.<p>I still think your difference holds true though. I am not trying to set up a straw man here. I fully admit that I can walk out today, talk to 20 businesses in a relatively short period of time, and land a new high paying gig. I could also walk out and talk to a dozen recruiting firms and accomplish the same thing. It&#x27;s easier for me than it is for an actor in the entertainment industry.<p>But I still see that there are a significant number of engineers who are willing to pay an agent to keep up these relationships for them.

If I am a dirt-shoveler with a v1.0 shovel, and I can make a hole with volume of 8 cubic yards in 8 hours, that sets the business expectation for how much a typical dirt-shoveler can do, and how much it costs to dig an additional cubic yard of holes.  Namely, it costs one hour of dirt-shoveler labor.<p>If the v2.0 shovel allows me to dig a hole with volume of 10 cubic yards in 8 hours, that reduces the marginal cost of digging an additional cubic yard of holes.  It now costs 0.8 hours of dirt-shoveler labor.<p>In the short term, the demand for new holes is unchanged, but the demand for shoveler labor has shifted left, as its supply is unchanged.  In the long term, the marginal dirt-shovelers--especially those without v2.0 shovels--exit the market.  The supply curve for shoveler labor shifts left, and price goes back up, as quantity decreases.<p>Deserving doesn&#x27;t enter into it.  If dirt-shoveler pay per hour does not go up to reflect the increase in productivity, some shovelers will stop digging for their living and go do something else (or remain unemployed), because they will get paid zero for the holes that they are no longer able to dig.  The ones who survive the cull will only be able to demand more pay when someone wants a hole dug, but can&#x27;t get anyone to do it at the offered rate.<p>The cost of a v2.0 shovel is now a barrier to entry to the profitable region of the dirt-shoveler business.  Now extrapolate to mechanized earth-moving equipment.  If you need to excavate a basement for a new building, you hire one guy with the $100000 v46.3 shovel, rather than 20 guys with 20 v3.1 shovels.  At this point, just owning the shovel is profitable, because that guy can just rent it out to people who know how to dig holes, but lack the necessary accumulated capital to be competitive in the business.<p>But those 20 guys you didn&#x27;t hire to dig your basement are still out there, and they&#x27;re getting hungry.

No, obviously not.<p>Enforcement is left to the officer/department/prosecutor. The tools merely provide the officer with additional means of conducting their work in the field.<p>>> But then they sit there ready to be used as justification for other police action.<p>Comes off as quite bitter, but there&#x27;s an actual point here. There is a consistent need to be &quot;hard on crime&quot;, and provided your point that there is &quot;average of more than one outstanding &#x27;warrant&#x27; per person&quot; in Ferguson suggests that finding additional means to identify those with warrants is a good thing - to, again, be &quot;hard on crime&quot;. However, the fact is that if a person has a warrant, then even a simple license plate/ID check will return the same information.

This system is clearly the most invasive and feared amongst HN readers, and while a warrant can be issued for innocuous things like missing child support payments, the same system could also be used to identify those who are suspected of more serious crimes.

A kitchen jargon, good enough for wives, with bad grammar and a master-race pronunciation, was usually preferred by the natives, who did not believe it was possible for a foreigner with a white skin to learn their language. Colonial civil servants had to disconcert these natives with a linguistic mastery, including a control of many registers, equal to, or greater than, their own. In Malaya, there were many languages, but Malay was considered, for political reasons, to be the obligatory specialisation. You could, if you were mad enough, learn Hakka or Cantonese or Kuo-Yu or Tamil or Hindi or Urdu, but you had to take examinations in Malay. You had to take the Standard One examination in your first year and the Standard Two before the end of your first three-year tour. If you failed, an efficiency bar was invoked, and you were not entitled to annual pay increments.&quot;<p>Burgess was by his account unusually competent linguistically, passing Standard Two by the end of his first year (which made him, he says, disliked) and Standard Three by the end of his tour (which made him hated).<p>[Edit: Burgess write of his first boss in Malaya that &quot;During the war he had had the chance to learn Japanesr, and he had been sent on a course with fine amenities, including recording apparatus.

In that time I have found new gigs either though networking with existing contacts, or through recruiters at dedicated recruiting firms, both of which have been successful.<p>Of course, there are issues with both approaches. When using my own contacts and networking, time and effort must be spent to cultivate more than the relationship. I must also cultivate the business needed to get the next contract. This time and effort is expensive but ultimate becomes very rewarding when a new contract is landed.<p>With recruiters there is less time and effort put into cultivating the business of getting a contract. However, recruiters come and go and so I am constantly cultivating relationships with recruiting firms to find the ones who understand the business, the clients, and my skills and can match me up correctly. Again this is time and effort which can be quite profitable, of course, in the end when a new gig is started.<p>However, I imagine there is a more efficient method of handling this. Right now, as the engineer, I am trading time for finding lucrative consulting gigs. Often the company either pays me hourly (or more accurately daily, or on a fixed bid rate), or they pay the recruitment firm. I do not have to pay any monetary sum to get a contract. However, I do make a sizable rate.

Even with carbon taxes priced in they can&#x27;t match the price of natural gas and coal. The reason is that they are not reliable sources of energy and with both of them you need batteries of some other type of storage to smooth out production. This essentially doubles the costs. Everything you read about the &#x27;cost&#x27; of solar and wind doesn&#x27;t take into account storage or the overbuild required to have backup power for cloudy days. The type of grid that uses 100% solar/wind would be a completely unreliable grid and cost considerable more for everyone. Solar and wind aren&#x27;t being adopted because they are worse for consumers, not because some cabal of special interests are keeping them out.<p>In fact the opposite is true.

We&#x27;ve learned a <i>lot</i> from the transition from 1.x -> 2.0, and definitely didn&#x27;t get everything right. That said, we think we can refine the 2.x -> 3.0 transition to make it much smoother based on what we&#x27;ve learned.<p>Given how fast the frontend ecosystem is moving, we&#x27;ve tried to strike the right balance between delivering new features and taking care to ensure that we don&#x27;t leave the existing ecosystem of apps behind.<p>I think you&#x27;ll agree that if we did <i>nothing</i>, our community would slowly die off as people moved to competing libraries and frameworks that made them more productive. So total stability would feel good in the short term, but long term, having to do a wholesale rewrite of your app because the framework stagnated would be much more painful, right? (You can approximate this effect by locking yourself into an older version of Ember, which sucks! People rightfully want the new features.)<p>The goal of Ember&#x27;s additive-only strategy is to deprecate features, rather than remove them. This is more work for the maintainers, but we think it&#x27;s worth it because users can &quot;refactor towards the future&quot; at their own pace, amortized over the year and a half between major releases. Development teams have a natural ebb and flow, and that amortization of deprecations over the year means you can use lulls/downtimes to refactor the deprecations out when it&#x27;s most convenient to you.<p>We made a mistake and rushed in a bunch of deprecations in 1.13 because it was our last chance to remove features for the next year or so. In retrospect, we got overzealous, and for that I am sincerely sorry.  Users like you rightfully felt overwhelmed, and that is something the entire system is designed to avoid.<p>If there&#x27;s a bright side, it&#x27;s that your app should continue to work as you upgrade, and when you&#x27;re ready to make the jump, you can upgrade to Ember 1.13 and refactor away all of the deprecations. Once that&#x27;s done (whenever you decide to do it), you will be able to upgrade to the latest version of Ember 2.x, because Ember&#x27;s SemVer guarantees means that a deprecation-free 1.13 app is compatible with any 2.x version (2.7, for example).<p>Sorry again that it&#x27;s been a slog for you. Once you&#x27;re through it though, we hope you enjoy all the new features, and we certainly hope the simplifications we&#x27;ve made to the framework over the last year make it easier for new developers to join your team and get productive.",1439481657

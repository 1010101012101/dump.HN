They don't talk much about what they do. I think ""preventing another terrorist attack"" sounds better than ""snooping into everybody's life"" -- although I'm not sure in practice there is a difference.",1193155050

71634,comment,71624,71624,0,0,mr,,,"Some months ago, I put together a web site to service the school and college market.. it is a messaging system that can broadcast messages to hundreds of phones via voice (a pleasant robot female voice!) or by text messages and also email. Ideal for schools, colleges to alert students or parents in case of weather related closings, or other emergencies. The plan was to sell it as a subscription service to schools and colleges on a per student basis (in the range of $ 3 -5 per student per year). Since building the site, my personal situation has changed... more day job responsibilities/priorities and no time to market this to customers (a full time job).<p>I was looking around to see if I could sell and the landscape is depressing. Options available:\na) Sell it on Ebay: Looked at this, but there is so much crud floating around on this site in the business section that I seriously doubt anyone would actually bid.\nb) Advertise with web business brokers: Most of these are scams that promise to put an ad on their site for hundreds of dollars.<p>Do any of you have any suggestions? I'm NOT looking for a big payout... would like to recoup some costs, and hopefully find a home for this site with an entrepreneur who has the time and the energy to go after this market. The web site is at www.quinalert.com. <p>Thanks\nM",1193154023

I'm not looking for coding/architecture/design practices but something more higher-up that outlines things like using wireframes for mockups, the interactions between the coders and the frontend designers, and if the frontend and backend progress at the same pace or is it better for one to progress ahead of the other?\nI've developed a few sites and I have a system that works fairly well for me, but I was wondering what everyone else does and why you think your way works for you.

71631,comment,71608,71608,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"I enjoyed the post until we hit Kant.  This ""imperative"": ""Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law."" is the kind of idea that makes it ""rational"" to go out and kill all the Jews as the Nazi's so aptly demonstrated. They felt that the elimination of Jews should become a universal law. Note that this is a very different idea than: act only as you would want others to act towards you.  It is rather: act only in a way that you think all others should act.  A very different story, and a complete void as to the defining of ""should"".<p>Kant was not only confusing to himself and others, but his ideas were ""dangerous"" to the extent that ideas can be when used to justify actions.",1193153807

71625,comment,71469,71560,0,0,davidw,,,"A vespa or scooter is a pretty good way of getting around too.  I had one when I lived there, and it was much more convenient than the car - easy parking (although sometimes the dickhead meter maids would give me tickets for parking the thing on <i>wide</i> sidewalks between trees...hrumph).  If it's rainy, you can dress up a bit more than is comfortable on a bicycle.  The drawback is that you're still pretty much stuck in the city, as you don't want to/can't take scooters on freeways.<p>",1193153489

If you have micropayment-based virtual beanie baby store that uses genetic algorithms to 'breed' new species of beanie babies with other users' virtual beanie babies, then lets you use on-demand manufacturing to buy physical copies of the new species, then you're back on topic. <p>PS: if anyone uses that idea, give me 10% equity, please.

I hope people realize good herbalists have mastered knowledge derived from THOUSANDS of years of trial and error (instead of a few months of clinical trials).  It is also very scientifically based.  The problem is that it is not regulated, so you do get your share of scammers looking to make a quick buck, but reputable and respected herbalists are as knowledgeable as any pharmacist.

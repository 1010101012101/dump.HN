I was one of the finalist, but just not good enough. The experience however was fantastic and a huge ego booster. They flew me over to California for few days and gave me a tour of GooglePlex. I have to say that my interview process was consistent with the article.\nMy ""google question"" was: \n""How would you fill out exact 4 liters in a Can of 5 liters and another Can of 3 liters, with unlimited supply of water?""\nI was able to answer it: Pour the content of the 3L can to the 5L one. Repeat the process again until the 5L can starts overfilling. So now you have 5L can full of water and 1L left in the 3L can.\nSo now, empty the 5L can, and pour in it that 1L leftover water from the 3L can. \nNow you have 1L in the 5L can. Fill 3L can with water and pour it again in the 5L can. So 1L + 3L == 4L :)\nStill it wasn't enough for the job as I may have failed the regular expression part of my interview...",1284533568

1693548,comment,1693357,1693357,0,0,patio11,,,"Ms. Meyer is very atypical.<p>Do you understand the economics of book publishing?  They have nothing to do with page count.  Typically, an author will be awarded an advance on signing their contract with the publisher.  For a first time fiction author, that would be about $5,000.  They are then given a percentage of sales of hardcover, trade paperback, and various other channels, with the first $N of those royalties kept by the publisher until the advance is ""earned out"", after which the author actually receives royalties.<p>Because publishing is a hit-centric industry, <i>most first-time authors will not earn out their advances</i>, so the total compensation for their first novel will be $5,000 (plus, more likely if they're successful, money for the sale of ancillary rights, such as foreign publication rights, etc).  If it goes on to be a mega-blockbuster, the sky is the limit.  J.K. Rowlings' revenues attributable just to the first Harry Potter book are in the hundreds of millions -- <i>most for the movie rights</i>.<p>For more on the economics of authordom, I highly recommend reading jakonrath.blogspot.com",1284533327

1693495,comment,1691223,1691223,0,0,korch,,,"I'll chime in with a rant about the URL bar because I've spent so much time thinking about how much I hate it.<p>First, slapping a simple breadcrumb menu over the text URL bar wouldn't be so hard, so it's a worthwhile experiment, at least just to see it in action. I'm all for experimental software. Consider how much of the web already use sitemap.xml? It's not much further of a leap to adapt sitemaps into a better description of whatever menu structure your web site uses. Browsers have always been vehicles for UI, and users have always suffered a million different web UIs. The web has become ""Mystery Meat Navigation"" all over.\n<a href=""http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/mysterymeatnavigation.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webpagesthatsuck.com/mysterymeatnavigation.html</a><p>I say kill the URL bar. The raucous against the ""breadcrumb bar"" seems to be mostly from technical types who are not so good at thinking from the perspective of non-technical end-users. It's difficult to go along with change, and throw out our floppy drives, I know this, but it must be done.<p>The URI bar belongs in text-mode UI land for one. As one who lives inside a Unix terminal, I'm generally biased against anything that exposes text-mode UI to users. Users just don't do text-mode. At least not since the days of DOS. They are already struggling with a graphically-based conceptual model of computers and the Internet, so showing them a flashing console cursor where they can type dozens of commands is just too much of a mind-blowing conceptual leap.\nIt can often be difficult for technical & engineering brains to look at something complex and rather than <i>figure out how it all works, all the way down to the bare metal</i>, most users <i>just want to follow the minimal path of effort to use their computers.</i><p>Using a single interface to represent both a graphical and text based input is generally a UI mistake. An error, a goof. The vast majority of users have no idea what a URL is, nor do they want to know, so they won't. Thus all the benefits of a text-based input is entirely lost to them. That URL bar space then becomes unused screen real estate. It's never good to waste limit screen space, and there are so many other redundant UI elements across every single web page nowadays, so it makes perfect sense to do something else with that space. How about let's take something users will never learn to use, and give them some <i>other UI feature which they will love?</i><p>Also, the URI bar is why we have so many users typing Facebook into Google search, going to the first result and then flooding whatever random forum with complaints about ""the new Facebook"", <i>without realizing they weren't even logged onto Facebook's site.</i> Most people don't know what a web page is, and they lack the conceptual model of linked documents, not to mention they will never know about DNS or Internet protocols.<p>The URL bar contributes to a lot of confusion amongst basic web users. We recently saw the Google Chrome video asking pedestrians to explain the difference between a browser and an OS, where none of them them could do so. The average Internet user will never know what a browser really is. <i>Face it, this is the horrible, sad truth you must face if you're making web browsers.</i> Users know just enough of the rat-box tricks, which levers to push or pull and where to move, in order to use the web in the most basic way. <i>And the simple UI they use for interacting with the web becomes identical to their conceptual model of the web.</i> I would argue that this reveals a point of failure of web browser design. Web browsers have a long ways to go to perfect their UI. From a design perspective, it is an impressive achievement to take something as incomprehensible as the Internet, and reduce it down to a handful of learned behaviors that become the lowest common denominator of usage.<p>We programmers instinctively think ""oh the web, it's just tcpip, routers, port 80, a web server, a path to the document resource, http headers back and some plain text to be interpreted and rendered."" Contrast that with what the average end users thinks: ""oh the web, I have no idea what a browser is, so let's open the Internet, it's here on my desktop, type in some text for Google, now surf around clicking links."" You think these users are using browser tabs? Bookmarks? Customized home pages? Any kind of content aggregation, RSS, etc? We developers need to face it—the majority of the ""gee-whiz"" amagical tech just waiting to be done on the web is only going to confuse users unless we can whip browsers into better UI shape.<p>And that means moving as much redundancy from web sites into stand-alone UI elements in the browser itself. Let each site have it's own browser chrome if it wants. It would be fantastic to have an API that allows integration between sites and the browser ""chrome"" itself. <i>i.e. context dependent behaviors, menus, buttons, login, status updates, etc.</i>",1284531798

As an added bonus, the input sanitization code allows dashes, as Amazon always displays it, but it passes it along verbatim to a web service that does not.<p>It takes one package at a time, which must already be installed for it to match the name, and the script is interactive — it always attempts to prompt you for <i>'Are these parameters correct?

1693467,comment,1692754,1693204,0,0,fhars,,,"Giving people responsible for performance tuning access to user data is almost inevitable if you run anything remotely like unix. After all, it may require tweaking kernel parameters, changing init sctripts or reinstalling applications compiled with different optimizer settings. All of these operations require root, which is an all or nothing affair in unix. (You can do some tricks with /etc/sudoers to restrict what else people who need root for a specific task can do as root, but writing a sudoers file that allows serious performance tuning and is still airtight might prove a challenge.)\nThis has in fact been criticized as a major design flaw of the unix authorization model. To prevent problems like these you need a more fine grained authorization model that separates access to the system and its configuration from access to the data, so that even if I can replace an application with something else, I still cannot make it write data to a location of my choice. This would reduce the number of people who I need to absolutely trust from everybody who may need to change some minor configuration file to the handful of people managing the security kernel of the OS.\nSystems like that are possible, but not easy to implement and mange correctly and sometimes inconvenient to use, so peole go the easy way and assume that everyone that is a member of a group mentioned in /etc/sudoers is trustworthy or at least lack the criminal energy to bypass the restrictions sudo can enforce.

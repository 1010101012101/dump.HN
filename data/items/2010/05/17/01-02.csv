1353265,comment,1350021,1350563,0,0,derwiki,,,"Honestly, it feels a bit weird to be ranting pro-Gates -- I spent most of my high school years despising him because of Windows (I did tech support for 4 years). I agree with you that while Gates did advance computing, if he hadn't, someone else would have -- and possibly do it better. Or do it worse.<p>The ""hours wasted"" argument doesn't hold a lot of traction for me. As anecdotal evidence, I believe I saw a statistic that ""House"" is watched by over 300 million people globally -- that's 300m * 42 minutes _per week_.

1353259,comment,1352826,1353196,0,0,jacquesm,,,"One of the trickiest 'resource constrained' code I ever did was an index across 100,000 hotels in 64K of RAM on a whole bunch of criteria, 100's of them. From swimming pool presence to dog walking service (and pets permitted or not) and so on.<p>Obviously, you can't really do it so I first pre-sorted the hotels with some common criteria in large chunks, then sampled random bits from the rest of the criteria to fill the memory based portion of the index. When a query would come in a mask was made for the various criteria in the same way as during the indexing, and this mask was then used to get the indices of hotels that <i>might</i> be right, candidates so to speak. Then the candidates would be loaded from disk and checked against all the criteria and an answer would be returned to the caller. It worked pretty good, the disk block caching mechanism really saved the day.<p>This was on a QnX system before they had a 32 bit/large model version...<p>That's when programming is fun!<p>Of course 64K is still not really 'constrained' ;)",1274061350

1353163,comment,1351074,1352320,0,0,elblanco,,,"I want to return to something I said because on review I realized it wasn't really clear<p><i>""The funny thing is that I've never actually seen any viable business models from the open source community about how to build a business around free software (as in beer and freedom) that wasn't entirely couched in ""support services"". ""</i><p>When I said ""build a business around free software"" I meant as the producers or authors of the software.<p>The reason I make this distinction is that I think most of your examples involves companies building a viable business around open source software as <i>users</i> of the software. I'm also implying a distinction between authors of software vs. people who modify the source to do something they want -- and yes I realize that's a bit of a stretched distinction w/r to open source. Often times the authors <i>are</i> the same people who use and contribute small bits of modifications to the code.<p>What I mean is that, say Apache for example, comes from the Apache Foundation. If I make some modification to the source to make it do some particular thing I want, I'm modifying the software in the same way a car enthusiast may modify their Honda to do something they want. (If, what I made is generically useful, I can submit it back to the Apache Foundation and perhaps cross the line to become and ""author"", but in most cases we're talking about people who mod software in some way).<p>The last place I worked for does about $10bn a year. It's a technology company with their hands in projects as diverse as autonomous undersea robots to text processing systems. They've successfully built a business around a mix of proprietary software solutions and some small percentage of open source software. The default OS is some Microsoft Server OS, databases are almost exclusively Oracle or SQL Server, Web servers are almost always IIS. They also write a lot of their own software, typically in Java (even before it was opened) and/or Perl but most of the software jobs involve writing code in some highly proprietary development environment like those you find in finance, HR, or some other types of systems. Java and Perl just happen to be go-to languages because it's easy to find people who write in those. Python was starting to show up a bit as well when I left that job.<p>They also get <i>ok</i> mileage from really true open source software. Red Hat finds its way onto some fractional percentage (along with Apache, JBOSS, and a few other odds and ends -- including the aforementioned Perl). But in many cases, they could do what they wanted with completely proprietary solutions. Those systems were usually selected due to some client requirement, or because the licensing costs are free (beer). I only ever ran into one true open source advocate in the entire place, and he was usually laughed out of proposal work because his ""solutions"" options would have extended the development effort by a year and required hiring an entirely new staff of people raised on that ecosystem rather than the preferred and proprietary MS/Oracle/Sun/Cisco ecosystem. Finding qualified staff to work on the open source stuff was frankly a continuous and quite major problem for us -- often times, because those people counted as people with specialized skillsets vs. the average run-of-the-mill trade school ""tech guy"" they simply cost more to hire. In other words, we ran the numbers over and over again, and open source rarely made sense for us.<p>I <i>do</i> think that the reverse is also true though, for small startups open source can make a lot of sense in both senses of the term ""freedom"". For the bottom line, it's free, if you are doing something weird you <i>can</i>, in theory, mod the software to do something unique. It's not always easy, and I've seen many cases where the target goal was too big for the staff and the startup folded. Web startups are also interesting because for the most part, the work they do with open source results in a completely proprietary web app (something RMS has lamented on quite a bit recently).<p>Many big businesses likewise do great things with and for open source (IBM, Sun and Apple come to immediate mind) in terms of funding the kinds of expensive Open Source development efforts that would otherwise not exist because building world class software by part-time hobbyists is extremely difficult -- there's really only a very small handful of those projects, and most of them have been funded recently by large corporations looking to leverage the initial investment/development effort to make <i>their</i> solution work like they want.<p>But by and large, large organizations will move to whatever accomplishes their goals for the least amount of $$$. Even startups. If a startup can use a proprietary solution for $x thousands of dollars vs. modifying some existing open project to scratch some itch for $y thousands of dollars, and x<y they'll go with the solution that costs x. For example, how many startups use Windows or OSX as their primary desktop OS vs. some flavor or Linux/BSD? Probably most.<p>This guy gets a lot of what I'm saying here.<p><a href=""http://lunduke.com/?p=1075"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lunduke.com/?p=1075</a><p>It's a great analysis of the problems in the community flavored with a hard dose of pragmatic realism.

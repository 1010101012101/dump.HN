Not that it makes a difference to the point you were attempting to make.  I'm just pointing out that the 'representation' numbers you gave imply that the Asian, Latino or Black populations at Harvard are composed exclusively of native born Americans, I wanted to make clear that they are not.  Though I suppose anyone familiar with Harvard would find that to be obvious.<p>With that, I wanted to say that if wealthy, British educated, Africans are more qualified than African-Americans, then why should Harvard not admit them.  Same with whites.  If Jews are more qualified than non-Jewish whites, then they are the ones who deserve the spot at Harvard.<p>I realize that wealthy people get a pass, and while that is unseemly to me, I cannot claim to find it entirely unexpected.<p>All of this is coming from a Christian Midwesterner from the under-class and a farm state.  So conservative that when I'm running the banks they won't pay any interest at all.  But if we live in a meritocracy, then we live in a meritocracy.  The fact of the matter is that if Harvard and other schools did not make 'allowances' there would be far fewer whites at Harvard than there are right now.  I know that it's hard to hear, but there it is.<p>Even at second-tier schools, 'allowances' are made far too often.  At the University of Wisconsin, they cut off foreign and out-of-state admissions so that less qualified Wisconsin residents can get some of the spots.  As a conservative, I find this EXTREMELY distasteful.",1191037323

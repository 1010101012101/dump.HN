I think you&#x27;re correct--until this becomes common and has undergone a few rounds of revisions, the numbers I gave are not in line with the current situation.<p>I still maintain the numbers as a likely reality in the near future. Once drones become common, they will be much cheaper than helicopters.

So thank you.<p>That said I do have a few nitpicks here:<p>> Luckily however, we have a way to tell which is more efficient: The free market!<p>I&#x27;m not going to argue this point, as I&#x27;m uninterested and others have taken up that torch.  Still, it&#x27;s worth pointing out that it&#x27;s not self-evident that A) A free market can exist for transportation, or B) That the free market equilibrium would be a desirable situation for anyone in this case.<p>> If you just make the buses free, people may take more roundabout trips to get to where they need to go, just to be able to make use of the free bus, causing inefficiency and waste.<p>This one I don&#x27;t understand at all.  A la carte public transportation is the one that encourages roundabout routes, because they often cause travelers to pay multiple fares.  All-you-can-eat public transportation encourages planners to serve customers as efficiently as possible, as opposed to making each <i>route</i> as efficient as possible.<p>> it can have a multitude of unexpected consequences.<p>I agree that this is true, but why would we assume that these consequences would be bad enough to offset the consequences we know about?  Why would we assume that, on the balance, these unexpected consequences would be bad rather than good?",1371664760

On more than one occasion they cancelled last buses stranding people.<p>The company would cheat the monitoring of punctuality by having buses wait at certain points along the route (notably the points at which punctuality measures were made) for sometimes 10 - 15 minutes, whereas wherever you actually wanted to catch a bus from you&#x27;d often be left waiting 20-30 minutes for a bus to turn up.<p>The bottom line is, if you want to live there + have any kind of quality of life, you have to own + run a car.

5907020,comment,5905885,5906879,14,0,king_jester,,,"> Maintaining a bus and subway system is extremely expensive in terms of resources, both in terms of equipment expenses, salaries (for employees who could be providing other benefits to society instead of operating a bus) fuel, and use of land.<p>Mass transit systems are not as expensive expanding and building up roadway systems in favor of automobile transit.<p>> There is no 100% certainty that buses/subways are more efficient than cars.<p>Mass transit is more efficient in a variety of ways compared to cars, esp. on cost per rider and utility cost of infrastructure per rider.<p>> Luckily however, we have a way to tell which is more efficient: The free market! The free market is not perfect, but it is likely that a person who pays a fare to ride a bus is getting significant value from that bus ride, and if the fare CAN COVER THE EXPENSES of running the buses, then we can be confident that buses are an efficient mode of transportation.<p>The free market has already demonstrated that cars are not as efficient as mass transit systems. Most cities prior to mass car adoption had mass transit systems, typically subways or street trolley systems. A lot of these existing systems were dismantled in favor of expanded roadways and bus systems. The net result is that riders are less able to move about on roads/buses, the cost is greater to riders to take any form of transit, pollution got worse, and roads now consume far more resources than those mass transit systems do.<p>> If you just make the buses free, people may take more roundabout trips to get to where they need to go, just to be able to make use of the free bus, causing inefficiency and waste.<p>If buses were free, then there would be not need to take a longer route since the most direct bus route would be free. Further, fee based mass transit does nothing to stop this right now and for most fee systems the fee does not completely cover the operating expense of the system, so this is something that already happens in lieu of free mass transit. Further, longer trips on some types of mass transit are far more environmentally friendly compared to the same trip made in a car or bus.<p>> Or, it may cause people to take more inefficient taxi trips (because the bus doesn&#x27;t take them to their precise destination like a personal car would) or they may do a million other things that are damaging to the environment and wasteful (like eating out more because they can take free bus trips to restaurants.)<p>The people that most need cheap or free transit are unlikely to be able to afford taxis, as they most certainly are not free and wouldn&#x27;t be scalable as a free transit option. Eating out at a restaurant is not necessarily more wasteful than other options, esp. in locations were food transit and delivery generate pollution due to delivery method, such as trucking (a lot of places do not grow or produce enough food stuffs to avoid importing).<p>> If you read this post and think I&#x27;m crazy and say to yourself &quot;What an idiot, cars are obviously guaranteed to be less efficient than buses&quot; I would argue you don&#x27;t understand how incentives behave in a complex system.<p>We have already seen how incentives the car and roadway system work, and that system most certainly is complex. Suffice it to say that this system has not been effective in providing transit needs for the masses and expansion of those system is not working as scalable solution for transit. As density increases, roadways become less efficient for travel period.<p>> If you think cars are so horrible, you should work to stop subsidies to oil companies so that gas prices reflect the true cost of energy. But in my view there is absolutely no way making public buses free is going to make cities more efficient and/or help the environment.<p>You can do more than just fight against oil energy policy to attack the public of public pollution from transit systems. If buses can displace a certain amount of cars on the road for a population they are more environmentally friendly and making such transit as accessible as possible is the best way to maximize ridership.",1371664169

I do wonder if that $18 million is only for the drone, or for its associated infrastructure on the ground as well, though.<p>My point was more theoretical than based on current costs. To me, it seems prices will almost certainly drop fairly quickly. There are many fewer constraints in building a vehicle that doesn&#x27;t have to hold a human. As the technology is produced in greater numbers, and as the technology is refined, I imagine the cost will plummet. And as the process becomes more automated, it will require less personnel as well. I imagine there will also be &quot;light drones&quot; that cost much less, if there aren&#x27;t already.<p>If there&#x27;s a counterargument for the price dropping, I&#x27;d love to engage with it, but I&#x27;m having trouble coming up with it myself.<p>I&#x27;d love to see some real numbers. My suspicion is that the amount of surveillance per dollar spent already heavily favors the drone and will only get better, but I could be wrong.

A lot of the OS foundation level features coming to the browser aren&#x27;t coming from Chrome/Google, but from Mozilla/Firefox and Samsung/Tizen. Check out all the WebAPIs. How many of them are being pioneered by Google? How many by Mozilla?<p>My personal opinion is that both are doing a lot to innovate and a lot for the web, but that they are complementing each other. Google is pushing forward the front-end and how the browser works with current content. Firefox is working to get browsers to the point where they can do many of the same things that operating systems can do today. A lot of that work is not as straight forward as reimplementing what operating systems do, since they often require entirely new trust paradigms because sensitive things are being exposed to the open Internet. It&#x27;s not a trivial task.<p>Lastly, Rust and Servo matter a lot. You will only be able to get so far with WebKit/WebKit2/Blink/Gecko/Trident, etc. before you start hitting the limit of the architecture of each is capable of. Rust and Servo are being architected from the ground up with the future of computing architecture in mind.

Here&#x27;s another summary: <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/CriticalCare/HeadTrauma/39122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medpagetoday.com/CriticalCare/HeadTrauma/39122</a><p>Not to be any sort of jerk, but until you&#x27;ve spent enough time cycling in traffic to be comfortable, your intuition regarding the safety of that activity is suspect. Several factors are involved. First of all, there is the risk compensation phenomenon (<a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418079"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418079</a>), which is also seen for seatbelt-wearers etc. and causes users of any &quot;safety&quot; device to behave less safely to compensate for that use. This phenomenon also applies to other road users, so that when they see a cyclist they perceive to be &quot;protected&quot; by a helmet they don&#x27;t give her as much space, they drive faster, etc. (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457506001540"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457506...</a>) Other factors are follow-on effects from the fact that requiring helmets reduces cycling rates (<a href=""http://www.nber.org/papers/w15658"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/papers/w15658</a>): fewer cyclists make for more dangerous roads for everyone (<a href=""http://www.ctc.org.uk/campaign/safety-in-numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ctc.org.uk/campaign/safety-in-numbers</a>) and cyclists who cycle less aren&#x27;t as good at cycling. There is a &quot;rhythm&quot; to riding in traffic, and after I&#x27;ve taken some time off, I have to be more careful until I sharpen up. With regular practice, you know:<p><pre><code>    - exactly how close the damn delivery truck is going to pass, just by the engine
      sound
    - which car is going to change lanes without signalling, not from its brakelights
      but from its slight pause in acceleration
    - how fast you have to pedal to intimidate an entering SUV into waiting for you
      to pass instead of turning left completely across all lanes
    - the distinct whine of a BMW (the official car of assholes) that&#x27;s going
      to attempt a right hook from 50 feet behind

Luckily however, we have a way to tell which is more efficient: The free market! The free market is not perfect, but it is likely that a person who pays a fare to ride a bus is getting significant value from that bus ride, and if the fare CAN COVER THE EXPENSES of running the buses, then we can be confident that buses are an efficient mode of transportation.<p>If you just make the buses free, people may take more roundabout trips to get to where they need to go, just to be able to make use of the free bus, causing inefficiency and waste. Or, it may cause people to take more inefficient taxi trips (because the bus doesn&#x27;t take them to their precise destination like a personal car would) or they may do a million other things that are damaging to the environment and wasteful (like eating out more because they can take free bus trips to restaurants.) These scenarios may sound silly, but the fact is that removing price signals from public transportation is a terrible idea because it can have a multitude of unexpected consequences.<p>If you read this post and think I&#x27;m crazy and say to yourself &quot;What an idiot, cars are obviously guaranteed to be less efficient than buses&quot; I would argue you don&#x27;t understand how incentives behave in a complex system.<p>If you think cars are so horrible, you should work to stop subsidies to oil companies so that gas prices reflect the true cost of energy. But in my view there is absolutely no way making public buses free is going to make cities more efficient and/or help the environment.<p>EDIT: Just to be clear, I&#x27;m not saying we should get rid of all public transport subsidies (this is a harder argument to make, I&#x27;m not sure where I stand on it.)

5906855,comment,5905277,5905560,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"The big problem Netflix faces in the long run is its production cost model. It&#x27;s well known within Hollywood that Netflix basically went to market and announced that it would pay 1.5x (or whatever) the going Hollywood rate for original material. Hence, it&#x27;s actually absorbing all the cost inefficiencies of Hollywood and magnifying them. It&#x27;s driving up prices and adding more inefficiency to the system. (FYI, Amazon is currently in town and doing the same).<p>Their ostensible gameplan is to do this in the short run, in order to get a hit or two on their hands -- at which point they can start dictating terms, rather than being dictated to. This is similar to HBO&#x27;s playbook, from back when it first entered the scripted development market. It&#x27;s a very big gamble. It paid off for HBO, and in recent years it&#x27;s been paying off for basic cable channels like AMC. But Netflix has a very different revenue model that is challenged by heavy, loss leading production costs. It&#x27;s also starting to face a lot of competition for essentially the same service rendered to consumers.<p>The question of whether this &quot;can only be good&quot; for consumers is a much thornier one. Economics suggests that more players in the distribution ecosystem will lower costs for consumers. And Netflix has already done a pretty great job lowering marginal costs of consumption. But Netflix isn&#x27;t really disrupting anyone on the content side, at least not yet; that&#x27;s largely because the studio system is really savvy about protecting itself from disruption.",1371662648

I have never before seen a system work so hard to discourage you from doing the right thing.<p>* Need to make an ajax endpoint?  Create a global function, call wp_hook to register it twice, and be sure to die() at the end of it.  Oh, and you can&#x27;t selectively register on HTTP verb, plus too bad if you wanted to use the param &quot;action&quot; for anything.<p>* Want to serve some JS?  Great!  wp_enqueue_script has you covered.  Unless you&#x27;re plugin is included after the header.  Unless unless you pass the optional &quot;place in footer&quot; flag.  Unless unless unless the theme doesn&#x27;t call wp_foot() (which is depressingly common).  Good luck!<p>* Need to serve something that isn&#x27;t JS or CSS, like a static HTML template?  Fine!  Just pass the whole path to the file!  Since we don&#x27;t do any routing other than cleaning up permalinks, every file has its own URL!  Oh, just be sure to use plugin_dir_url() to get the base path.  But despite the name that returns the path to the current file not the plugin so you should probably call it once in your plugin initialization file and cache the result in a global constant or something.<p>* Looking to do some safe SQL queries?  Fantastic! Here&#x27;s $wpdb->prepare.  Which, by the way, doesn&#x27;t have a named argument syntax.  So if you have any optional params or dynamic segments in your SQL then you&#x27;re going to have to prepare a whole query for each permutation.  Oh, and I know you&#x27;re building your queries by hand, but be sure to use &quot;SELECT * FROM {$wpdb->posts}&quot; instead of &quot;SELECT * FROM wp_posts&quot; just in case the table prefix isn&#x27;t set to the default.<p>And that&#x27;s just off the top of my head.  Seriously, even assuming you know the right way to do any of the above (which in an environment that is quite explicitly aimed at being friendly to non-developers is far from a given), actually doing it involves jumping through countless obscure hoops.  The simple fact is that making an ajax.php file and starting it with require_once(&#x27;../../../../wp-config.php&#x27;) or doing string interpolation into raw SQL, though horrible from both security and portability standpoints, are not only easier to write but make for clearer and more understandable code.",1371661681

I did have access to inmates&#x27; &quot;travel cards&quot; which detail their crimes and other information because I routinely transported inmates to other units; usually to medical or psychiatric facilities. I did not have the ability or occasion to compile statistics, but my best guess is that a lot of them were convicted of drug crimes. My best guess though is really no better than any random person&#x27;s because there were so many prison units in TDCJ, and the populations of those units were classified partly based on their crimes. Most of the people I transported were violent offenders.<p>2. A huge and expensive tragedy of justice and of economic policy. Imprisoning people for non-violent drug charges takes what are often productively employed people out of the work force and turns them into a unit of negative productivity, taking with them, probably another additional person by the time you account for all of the officers and support staff needed for running a huge prison infrastructure. People imprisoned even for drug charges rarely re-enter the workforce, at least not at any reasonable level. After release, they are stigmatized and often victimized again through various ex-con hire subsidy programs.",1371661436

There will be massive shortages of available bus space.  With a paid system, people are forced to economize--do I really need to pay to take the bus in winter 5 blocks to buy groceries, or can I walk?  But if it&#x27;s &quot;Free,&quot; then people will not economize.  The people who need the bus the most, to go to work or hospital or whatever, will have to compete for limited space with people who don&#x27;t need to be taking the bus.  In addition, alternative transit options that could relieve excess demand would be driven out of business (because who can compete with free?).  So, the city will be forced to massively increase the cost of the program to meet demand, which would lead to higher taxes anyway, likely offsetting the nominal bus fees that were eliminated.",1371661399

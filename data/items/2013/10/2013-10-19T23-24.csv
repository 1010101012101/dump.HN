Aside from backdoors and the security of these appliances/devices from a system perspective, what about network connectivity and the transport layer? Only recently, within the past few years [1], has SSL/443 become a requirement for some of the bigger organizations out there. Seems to me that security is often an afterthought. Smart Appliances/Devices run the same risks, and it stands to question; are they connecting securely? And if not, how long will it take them to secure their transport? Because even if that brand new IP-enabled Door Lock is secure from a system perspective, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if someone can subvert the transport layer, take control, and open the Lock.<p>One of my Projects attempts to solve this problem for the new generation of IP-enabled Appliances/Devices. I plan to make the process painless and easy. Everyone wins, both customer/consumer and developers/providers. Does anyone want to build it with me?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/14/yahoo-to-make-ssl-encryption-the-default-for-webmail-users-finally/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2013/10/14...</a>",1382226682

I even got relatively good grades for that first year, but I decided I had to change, and ended up doing economics and philosophy (both of which have their own problems worthy of another thread).<p>Now I should state that swapping out of CS does not mean I no longer work with computers/programming.  On the contrary, now I can use it to whip up solutions in every other field that most of those practitioners can&#x27;t, and if there&#x27;s one thing working with economists/mathematicians/statisticians/scientists teaches you, its that they can&#x27;t program something efficiently to save themselves.  In my darker moments I wonder whether all the supercomputer hardware at CERN/Universities/Government/Corporates is just bad algorithms/code that runs 5000 times slower on hardware 500 times faster...anyway...<p>I got out of CS at uni because it was very clear that the university was there for an industry.  I loved the systems/art of programming, so I imagine it was a bit like going along and enrolling in a painting course with hopes of doing the Sistine chapel, only to find that most of &quot;painting&quot; was actually about how to cover the side of a skyscraper or a house.  Same words, even very similar mediums...different realities.  Not why I started working with computers.<p>Two other aspects come to mind.  The first: the hyper-capitalism/money-making/app-writing/insecure ego/self-help-you-can-too!/superficial/start-up culture.  I realise that hacker news is part of y-combinator, which is also part of american culture (yes, i went there), so you&#x27;re going to get a lot of suck up children who really just want to be rich/popular/important, but my god I can&#x27;t think of a more brain-dead boring topic filled with so many repugnant people.  Is there anywhere that&#x27;s like hacker news with the whole start-up/get rich quick element removed?  Cause that would be lovely :P<p>And the second is that anyone who thinks that university or work is going to magically lead to or remove you from some sort of otherwise compelling or fulfilling life is smoking some powerful crack.  Work is work, and its going to pretty much suck, and a lot of the labour-as-meaning-of-life-protestant-work-ethic-consume-be-rich-go-into-debt is basically social indoctrination to provide a nice supplicant workforce.<p>Life&#x27;s big and complicated.  Stress over the fact that you&#x27;ve got a lot of control over what you want from life, which means you can do a lot of things that other people say you shouldn&#x27;t.  But don&#x27;t stress over notions that studying X at university/working at company X is going to lead you to ruin or fill you with regrets.

To the best of my knowledge, once you give someone equity, they have power over your company.  They can fuck you up.<p>Whenever anyone offers to buy some equity, I consider how much time will it take me to manage the transaction, (and then how much time will it take to manage the other owner ongoing.)   -  then, &quot;how many hours, working as a consultant, would it take me to earn that amount of money free and clear.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s amazing how often I&#x27;d spend fewer hours consulting to earn, free and clear, the amount of money that a smallish &#x27;angel&#x27; type wanted to invest.

Everything, from gluing libraries together, to understand the beautiful math behind it all. From the lowest levels of gates and electricity to the most abstract applications, I find it sublimely beautiful! I spend almost all my time thinking about programming, thinking about problems, wondering how I can do different things. Every day I learn about something (or many things) that expand my knowledge and add to the parts of this elegant world I can already understand.<p>Something I realized pretty recently is:<p><pre><code>    I&#x27;m really lucky to have something that I want to spend every day working on.

If you really love programming, you&#x27;ll probably be drawn to it again. If so, then do it for fun and see where it takes you. You&#x27;ll probably find though, that most others careers also suck in many ways, and if you like programming, then being a pro programmer isn&#x27;t that bad of a route.<p>Overall you have good points though for people early in their careers/education. People should consider their motivations honestly before devoting a lot of time/money/effort to it and it&#x27;s easy to be blinded by other factors. In the end, most people who make it through a CS degree and entry level jobs to excel in software careers seem to really enjoy programming itself. Others who get into it for money or family pressure usually end up as mediocre or below-average programmers (which is probably fine btw, not everyone needs to be awesome at what they do nor do they necessarily have to like it).",1382224055

Surely we can agree that challenging your mind is a good thing.<p>Don&#x27;t try to generalize my argument into absurdity. Simply not doing math because it is difficult doesn&#x27;t solve the underlying problem, which is probably to become proficient at math. Now if there were easier ways to become proficient at math than what you were already doing, that would be more in line with my argument.<p>The key thing is <i>solving problems</i>. Simply giving up on learning math, or reading, solves <i>no</i> problem.<p>> Is it impossible to find any enjoyment in challenging your body as well as mind?<p>Challenging your body and maintaining good health are distinct goals, though they may be satisfied through the same processes. If you want good health, and a certain diet makes that easier, then I will say that it is no sense in maintaining whatever old diet you had simply because that would make it harder. If you want to challenge your body, and simply maintaining good health is not challenging enough, there are endless possibilities. Recreational sports, for example. Gymnastics. Parkour. But personally I would not choose to do things that were clearly suboptimal for my body solely because it would be <i>more challenging</i>. I might do it because I gain other things, such as eating tasty but unhealthy food, but I wouldn&#x27;t choose to do it if the goal was only to make things harder for myself.",1382223997

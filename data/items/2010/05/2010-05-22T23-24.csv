1371313,comment,1371064,1371308,0,0,dotBen,,,"good question. I would suggest:<p>a) you might have passengers in the car who have something ilegal on them. in many states if a passenger drops drugs in your car so that it is not on their person, and no one admits to it, then it is considered the driver's property. Yes, even good friends might rat on you in this situation.<p>b) If the cop is looking to find anything to make an arrest to help them go with a hunch about you then they can start inspecting your tires or placement of a GPS on the window (illegal in many states) and could then drum up a charge of driving dangerous vehicle etc.<p>c) rental cars - you can never 100% check a rental car and it has been known for innocent people in Las Vegas to get stopped and the police find traces of cocaine powder etc in the ash try or coin holder, etc that belonged to a previous renter<p>In my case... I drive a sports car and so I keep <i>nothing</i> in the car in order for it to be as light as possible (no junk in the back, no crap on the floor). I have nothing in the car, I've never been in the possession of a controlled substance, I know my car is in top condition, etc... and I still wouldn't let the police search my car.",1274572720

For instance:<p>""Amongst other things, growth is needed in a capitalist economy to offset labour productivity – in other words, to provide new jobs for people made jobless by the economy’s relentless drive towards increasing labour efficiency, which itself is stimulated by the need to grow in order to outcompete others.""<p>Productivity doesn't create joblessness.  When people are able to spend less on one thing, they can spend more on other things, things that people must work to provide.<p>Efficiency doesn't create joblessness.  It creates wealth.

The people who told me this were experts on this sort of thing and the point they made is that innocent people have been convicted by accidentally saying something that implicated them.  They also made the point that this has happened even when the police officers themselves believed the person was innocent because those officers turned the case over to a District Attorney who really just wanted a conviction.<p>So while I know you’re just doing your job by trying to get me to talk to you I need you to understand my outlook on this which is that my life might depend on me keeping my mouth shut right now.  What I will say is that I’m completely innocent of these charges and I think you’re wasting your time talking to me.  Beyond that I’m going to keep my mouth shut from this point on and wait for my lawyer.  Thanks for understanding.<p>...As far as any false claims the police might make they don't have the right to do anything without a warrant so I'd use vaguely the same speech as above but substitute in ""I've been told you need a warrant to search my person or possessions""<p>Edit: I just IMed a friend who is a lawyer and he made a good point on searches.  When the police claim they have the right to search your person or possessions you want to do two things.  First, explicitly say you forbid them to search unless you are legally required to allow them to do it.  Second make them take physical action (e.g. if they want to search you tell them you won’t empty your own pockets but you won’t resist if they search your pockets).  Do these two things and you’ll never be searched unduly.",1274571168

1371253,comment,1370392,1370392,0,0,simonsarris,,,"> Star Wars: The Empire Strikes back is one of the best science fiction films ever made.<p>I do think that Empire Strikes Back is an enormously enjoyable film, but I take at them calling it science fiction.<p>I feel this might be a bit of an unpopular sentiment, but Star Wars was never really science fiction at all. It had all the things Ars said it did: Good story, good character development, good settings, good effects, but at the end of the day it was literally a Fantasty/Romance with a large FX budget (for the time). There was no science that was actually integral to the series itself, or at least none that could not have been replaced with Knights-and-dragons style elements just as easily.<p>Compare to the story elements to (just for instance) Ghost in the Shell, which was a science fiction that asked a lot of questions: In the future, how will people deal with cyborgs? How will they deal with longer lifespans? How will they deal with 21st century governments breaking down? How will society deal with a new and more pervasive ""net?"" The show tries to deal with many of the pains of emerging technologies and an evolving world.<p>Compared to such sci-fi, Star Wars was just a romance novel <i>plus lasers</i>. Empire Strikes Back was good, definitely, but not precisely because of sci-fi elements.",1274569894

Here is an example:<p>Suspect is in the police station being questioned and the police officer says ""we know you did it, your friend who we arrested in the car with you said you did it. he just gave a statement. Why don't you just sign this confession now and we'll sort out a deal"".<p>(The police officer lied, the other person hadn't said anything let alone made a statement)<p>In the US that would be admissible in court because it doesn't matter how the confession was reached, even lies (short of beating the suspect/etc).

As far as I know, nothing I've ever said to any police has been used against me.  Of course, I assume I've hardly ever been a suspect, so maybe that's part of it, but the difficulty with all of this ""don't talk to the police"" is that we don't have any statistics on what percentage of people who talk to the police never even get arrested.<p>It's probably quite true that it will be difficult for the courts to convict you of anything if you don't talk to the police.  However, it seems like there'd be a large risk of attracting a lot more attention than you otherwise would have, should you conspicuously <i>refuse</i> to talk to the police.  Being arrested and having to endure a trial is, itself, a fairly large imposition on someone's liberty and time, and it's hard to know how many people would have been looked at far more closely had they insisted on saying nothing.",1274569782

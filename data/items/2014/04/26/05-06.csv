If you actually want to study under a particular professor spend the time to actually learn about their research. Ask them intelligent questions that show that you have read their papers.

What I&#x27;m suggesting would be to reimplement git itself on top of distributed object storage -- effectively, to split git into two tools:<p>1. one that commits treeish diffs into objects, and then stuffs them into arbitrary content-addressable storage;<p>2. and one that manipulates (local or remote) mutable tables of refs to content-hash-URNs -- or &quot;git repositories&quot; for short.<p>The key component would be a facility (either a library or an OS service) for resolving content-hash-URNs into file-descriptors in some content-addressable storage system. The critical point is that this would <i>not</i> be a git component -- the committing tool wouldn&#x27;t be in charge of where its objects go, and the repository tool wouldn&#x27;t be in charge of resolving their URNs. Instead, both would just be relying on the host to decide how to get objects from/put objects into storage, and it&#x27;s the host that would have a distribution strategy set up for <i>all</i> of its content-addressable objects, not just the ones that happen to be attached to git.",1398490214

But Indirectly I grew my interests in Simulations, Video Games which lead to my discovery of a field called Machine Learning, AI and Robotics.

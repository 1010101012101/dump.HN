218110,comment,218021,218095,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"Yeah, i agree. Bulgaria isn't as bad as it used to be when i was a kid in the nineties and early 2000-s. I mean we have two new playgrounds where kids can play football near my school, almost everybody can afford a mobile phone and  the people living in extreme poverty are allot less than what i remember it the nineties(im born 1990). We need better education. Bulgaria had very good education, but it's declining. The teachers have miserable salaries, the students are not motivated. Basically we need some cool after class activities, because now most of the kids are just getting stoned, because of the boredom. In my home town there used to be a free government funded air modeling club. Kids just learned and had a hobby for after school. Now its private and its too expensive for me. There were allot of stuff like that that either disappeared or got really expensive because of privatization. And the only alternatives are sport and drugs. I see improvements in the sport part. There are allot of programs and stuff, but it's not enough and its not only sport thats important. In school computer education is broken. BROKEN. We all just surf the net or chat or in my case show off my cool little scripts that i made home. So we don't need better anti mafia and anti drugs squads, we need better teachers and more after school activities that are free(or relatively cheap). Of course thats only for the region. In Africa they need doctors and teachers and farm equipment and stuff.",1213548696

218102,comment,217629,217713,0,0,DenisM,,,"Normalization/denormalization is like creating/dropping indexes - it changes physical data layout without changing data model.<p>Either one of the four can and does in some circumstances increase or hinder performance.<p>For exmample: if you drop all indexes, queries that depend on it become slow. If you create an index on every column it will take longer for optimizer to consider all possible strategies, and it will take longer to maintain indexes.<p>If you copletely denormalize your data you may see increased read performance since there will be less need to do joins. Or you may see decreased read performance because now your data tkaes more space on disk and you do more IO.<p>So, yes normalization/denormalizarion is a valid performance optimization technique. It also happens to carry with it the risk of violating data integrity which must be guarded against.",1213547052

218098,comment,217914,218061,0,0,gaius,,,"Let's say you have a 10,000 logged-in users on your website, of which 1000 are concurrently active. That's very difficult to do with a RDBMS, because (most) RDBMSs do a lot of work to start a session, and maintain an awful lot of session state (for example, Oracle pre-allocates a chunk of memory private to each session to do sorting in).<p>So you put something in the middle, that multiplexes those sessions down into say 100 session on the database, checking connections in and out of a pool as necessary, queueing requests asynchronously if there are no free connections in the pool. You avoid the expensive creation/destruction of database sessions, as you start the sessions when the middle tier starts and keep them, and you keep the session state the database has to maintain at an optimal level. Cleverer architectures add effectively another layer between the middle tier and the database to cache query results (because you the developer can <i>know</i> what data you can cache like that, but the database can only make a best guess).<p>In ""sharding"" I suppose the middle tier also has to do some logic to figure out which ""shard"" to direct the query to. Note that <i>this logic must be done</i>, whether you do it yourself in your code, or you let Oracle do it for you in the query optimizer, picking the right partition(s) to actually execute the SQL on.",1213546887

From what I've seen, the children targeted by the program have not been in situations reflective of life-threatening destitution, nor is the correlation between poverty and rapist-fathers particularily strong.<p>The vast bulk of charity goes to exactly the sort of things you mention, with Gates and Buffet being the obvious current examples. This kind of charity has generally failed as just giving people food (etc) is a temporary fix of a long-term problem. And so OLPC is trying to improve kids' future productivity.

218094,comment,217914,218018,0,0,babul,,,"Plus web apps will soon be big business in India as it allows them to compete in international markets with stronger currencies (i.e. USD/GBP is greater then Indian Rupee) without the associated export/manufacturing costs, and the benefit of their own homes/area/country.<p>Hence instead of working for $10k~20k (USD) on average in a multinational/call-centre, they will form tech/consulting startups. This is already been demonstrated in the macro-scale with names like InfoSys/TCS/MindTree/HCL and now will happen in the micro-scale too, especially after media coverage of people like the Scrabulous founders etc (who many media sources claim earn about $20k~$30k a month in just facebook advertising).<p>Only a matter of time till we see a web superhit from India, imho.",1213546387

Black's book is a great intro to exactly the techniques of method_missing, mixins, class_eval, #included, etc, you need to understand the world of rails source and plugins/gems.  1st edition Ruby in Nutshell covers ruby 1.6, is small enough that you can read the whole thing carefully several times. The 2nd edition, by Flanagan and Matz, is also a must-have reference, but not something you read straight through.<p>Also recommended: the ruby/metaprogramming chapters in Ediger's ""Advanced Rails"" (oreilly) and Rappin's ""Professional Rails"" (Wrox).

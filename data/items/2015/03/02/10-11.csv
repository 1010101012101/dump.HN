But even that might be misleading, for example industrial areas having low population densities but nonetheless a lot of people in the area during working hours. And while population density might be relevant for some crimes it might be irrelevant for others. Where not to park your car is probably better normalized by the number of parking spaces or even the number of cars present. So don&#x27;t try to read to much out of maps or charts not specifically crafted to answer the question you are interested in.",1425293865

9131258,comment,9129248,9130652,0,0,mintplant,,,"<i>Have you reported the bugs to the project developers? Have you sent them a patch?<p>When checking open-source projects, we almost always report the results to their authors. If we publish such a report as an article, we try to send the link to it to the developers. If there are too few bugs in a project to write an article about, we still report whatever results we&#x27;ve got to the authors. Or rather, we try to - sometimes developers don&#x27;t (strange as it may sound) have any contacts, or their bug trackers don&#x27;t accept messages, or you need to enter a captcha which no one can solve.<p>That&#x27;s why we never send patches. There are a few reasons for that:<p>1. We are not familiar with the code and therefore cannot be sure if all the bugs we catch are really bugs. To understand that, we would need to study the project very closely.<p>2. Even with obvious bugs, we often can&#x27;t say for sure how to fix them.<p>3. Finally, we pursue but one goal with our articles - to demonstrate the capabilities of the analyzer we develop. That is, we want to prove that our tool can find bugs in a real-life, living code. We don&#x27;t aim at fixing bugs - we aim at proving that our tool can find them.</i>",1425293335

No offense, but I think that sounds so arrogant and misguided I am speechless (not meaning you, I mean the movement).<p>There are plenty of other human activities that also require and train intelligence. I would like to see some actual research on why programming supposedly is more effective in making people smart than other things.<p>And then personally I would say people should learn some basic maths before learning programming. That would help even more, for example to avoid financial breakdown.<p>I really thought the movement started because people saw so many &quot;I became a billionaire by programming&quot; stories in the media, and felt that without programming people would end up poor. But for example with design it is much easier to make money on the internet. Just throw together something nice about a current meme and sell a T-Shirt. I don&#x27;t know how much work designing a T-Shirt is, but I am pretty sure it is less than coding a startup that makes money. Especially, since for a website or app that makes money you&#x27;ll also need good design, so it is a strict subset of &quot;sell a T-Shirt&quot;.",1425293309

It is not, anecdotes notwithstanding, possible to &quot;improve your health by improving your emotions using this technique for which there is a solid track record of success&quot;. There _isn&#x27;t_ a &quot;solid track record of success. That&#x27;s the whole point.

If I, or any other of the many sufferers out there, could heal ourselves through some emotional technique then we would be _over the moon_. But we (and many others) have read the books; tried the techniques; and are right where we started: wanting real funding for real research for a real disease.<p>Physiological treatment will work alone, just like they have for stomach ulcers, and countless other illnesses that were previously attributed to vague, non-scientific explanations.

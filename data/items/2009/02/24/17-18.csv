493347,comment,491936,492688,0,0,smokinn,,,"Thanks, I know it makes sense from an employer perspective, I just wanted to point out that there are exceptions so while I can understand reluctance in the interview I personally wouldn't set the resume aside and not give an interview at all.<p>To answer your question, no I wouldn't quit. I actually took a pay cut to work where I currently am because I thought I would enjoy the job more. (And I do.) I don't ever ""expect"" a bonus. Banking on a bonus I think is a really bad idea. You should get what you consider is a fair wage rather than expect a bonus to make up for whatever you think is lacking. People should be wary of companies that offer a salary that is below market average but promise bonuses or ""quick pay raises"". They often don't materialize.",1235498145

Those bursts account for pretty much everything good that I've put out over the last few years, and I've learned not to try to tackle anything important when I'm not in that mode.<p>Other, normal days, I start out by checking the surf report.  If there's no swell (and I don't feel like climbing that day), I'll just wade through low priority bug reports and other mindless things like text changes and layout tweaks.<p>This approach works surprisingly well, since it means that I get maybe 4 days of ""Weekend"" scattered throughout the week, and am thus usually pretty fresh in the morning.  It doesn't quite fly at an office job though (I usually limit myself to one day off for surfing when working an on-site contract), but frankly I find that to be a competitive advantage.",1235498016

493341,comment,493010,493238,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Thanks Ekpyrotic. Good food for thought.<p>Regarding 1), I would be certainly interested in what X can be shown to be true within Objectivism such that its establishment would undermine the system or cause a contradiction. As it is based on the Law of Identity I think one would be hard pressed to find an X that poses a problem, but hey, I'm all ears! :-)<p>Regarding the bridge between what-is --> what-ought. Certainly a hard problem prima facia. I'm not a trained philosopher, but I would say that, starting with ""(A) != (!A)"", one can say A ""ought"" to do action x if x preserves or enhances A's identity, that is to say, A's existence. So a black hole ""ought"" to accrete matter, because that is what black holes do, and accreting matter preserves and enhances the black hole's identity as a black hole, that is to say, it's existence, since, for Rand, identity is tantamount to existence. So man ""ought"" to be selfish because man IS by identity a selfish being. Acting selfishly preserves an individual's identity as a selfish being, i.e., preserves that individual's very existence. To ""live for others"" is to lose one's identity, and by declension, one's existence. ""What-ought"" it seems to me can have no meaning apart from the preservation of its subject or its actor. I ""ought"" to do that which preserves my genes, just like a black hole ""ought"" to accrue matter. There is no ""ought"" it seems to me divorced from preservation of existence, or preservation of identity. Thus:<p>1) Man is by identity selfish. 2) Man does not exist without his identity. 3) Man does not exist outside being selfish. 4) There is not ""what-ought"" beyond ""what is needed to preserve existence of the actor, for all other meanings are subjective. 5) Man ought to preserve his existence. 6) By 2) existence is identity, so man ""ought"" to be selfish.<p>Admittedly a tough one, but that is my ""stab"" at it for the moment, ha!<p>Again, I would be interested in what X could be proved true within Objectivism such that Objectivism becomes inconsistent. :-)",1235497741

Do you need this backed up with facts?  It's pretty well known.  Albums are a great way to advertise your live music.  It used to cost a ton of money to make a crappy recording.  Now it's practically free to create a good recording.<p>I don't see the point of the recording industry, frankly.  I'm not willing to give up my right to share with people in order to ensure that the record companies exist.  Sorry.  Listen to the crap that is put out by record companies.  They control the radio stations.  You here the same thing all day, from DJs who don't even know what they are playing.  Most of the quality stuff is made without their help, they merely act as a distribution channel.<p>I see music as being much more home grown in the future.  Maybe DJs will once again play what they like instead of what corporations force down our throats.  One thing is for sure, if people love music they will continue to make it.  We will be left with a lot less crap once the record companies are gone.",1235497209

143507,comment,143148,143501,0,0,ojbyrne,,,"The thing is there's a difference between the equity of management founders, and ""non-management founders"" which is basically just that the former get a seat at the table at any negotiations, and the latter doesn't. I actually didn't know there were non-management founders till I got to California (you hear occasionally about them - linkedin has one). And the thing I also learned is that liquidity of equity is more important than the percentage.<p>And I don't think that Kevin added all the value in the beginning. He was significantly less famous at that point, and in fact was about to become unemployed. Many of his coworkers tried to launch sites around the same time, with nearly as much fame, and they all failed.<p>There was a lot of luck.",1206215973

The first is: How does one promote a website in general? The second is: How do I promote this particular website?  The first question is interesting to a broader audience than just me, but if anyone has any suggestions for the second, I'd certainly be appreciative.<p>The website is called Golimojo (http://www.golimojo.com) and the service it provides is Wikipedia ""autolinking"".  Basically you can take a webpage and have Golimojo examine it for noun phrases that can be linked to Wikipedia articles whose titles match those phrases.  Golimojo is smart enough (I'm using ""smart"" loosely) to autolink nouns like say ""Iraq"" or ""Iran"" but not common words like ""page"" or ""men"".  It works better on some pages than others.  I did most of my testing on political blogs (lots of name dropping) and the online versions of newspaper and print magazine articles (poorly linked even today, fifteen years after the World Wide Web was invented).<p>Now out of the billion-odd Internet users out there, probably only a tiny fraction of them would find Wikipedia autolinking really useful.  Still that could be thousands or even tens of thousands of users.  The question for me, is how do I find them?  In particular, how do I find them without putting a lot of effort and money into the process?<p>One obvious target market is Wikipedia editors who might like a tool to help them identify missing links in Wikipedia articles.  But there seem to be dozens of Wikipedia mailing lists, and I'm not sure how a service that looks like it might be commercial would be received (I have no commercial expectations at this point).<p>Any ideas?",1206215210

143501,comment,143148,143287,0,0,andreyf,,,"My implication, and I think you got it, was that you should have definitely gotten more than ""some equity"". I speak from no experience (still a student), but I don't think I'd care who is paraded in front of the media as ""the founders"" - whatever makes the company more likely to succeed is best. If the other guys are more media-friendly than I am, all the better!<p>What would really matter for my ego is what piece of the pie I get in the end, although, in your position, it sounds like that's a hard area to negotiate, too, since said ""semi-famous person"" is adding all the value in the very beginning (before any code is written). This is probably faulty logic to base your equity on, since your piece should be proportional to the value you add at acquisition.",1206214719

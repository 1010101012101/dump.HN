5791298,comment,5789396,5791237,1,0,dorian-graph,,,"Well, perhaps I don't. The reasoning was similar to that of money. People have indicated that if you stop paying for things (DRM-laded goods and services, for example) the companies will notice the lack of sales and change their behaviour accordingly. Now, for not watching, perhaps if they noticed that torrents that previously had tens of thousands of people downloading only had a handfulor better yet, the different warez groups/whatever stopped their releasesthe companies would notice that people are making a stand by not even watching. Popularity of TV show x would go down and what happens when TV shows aren't popular? They're killed. Also, supposedly people pirate things, come to like them, and then buy them so limiting watching also leads to making your preference known.<p>I think that not watching could be even more powerful than not voting with your wallet. It shows greater self-control, dedication, etc. It says ""Screw you guys, we won't even watch it!"" Though, as mentioned in my previous post, I doubt many people would do that as they simply want something for free nor are they so invested in the whole anti-DRM thing.<p>Even if I don't understand voting, I would still love to hear why the hell people are so up in arms about not being able to watch a TV show especially so when their complaint is that it's released a week later. It would be fantastic to see the pirates look at themselves and what they're doing wrong. A last thing I would like too is an answer to a question: If I create something and will only sell it for $1000 and it is not a human right/basic necessity, if I ask or tell you to not acquire it and use it without paying, would you follow what I've said or ignore it? -- you here isn't meaning you, icebraining.",1369896769

Redesigning a process to avoid sorting data.  Eliminating global locks.  Spinning off tasks to parallelized processing (especially if you have multiple cores/systems available.  Pipelining data to avoid writing/reading from disk multiple times.  Handling data in memory rather than on disk.

They ask for tons of stuff. Last 4 of SSN was one part, and they also asked questions about streets I lived on years ago, specifically, which county those streets are in. They must have a contract with someone who has a database of this kind of stuff.<p>But I got through that and was hung up on the last step, ""Online ID"", which requires a Facebook account (don't use it under my real last name), LinkedIn account (don't have one), or recording an introduction video (not possible while I'm sitting in a busy coffeeshop, also seemed like a pretty absurd ask). At this point I wanted to bail out but there was no ""Cancel Reservation"" button anywhere and they had my CC info hostage. So I had to close my whole account.<p>By the way, this was an account I had previously used to book an Airbnb place with no problems, and got a positive review from the guy.

This is opposite but functionally equivalent to have traditional server-side MVC frameworks handle this, which is to declare the view in the controller or the routing (which you can also do in AngularJS, you actually typically declare both the view and controller in the routing).  But the point is, you have to declare the link somewhere.  Declaring it in the view is no less proper than declaring it in the controller.<p>Having said all that, I'm really impressed with React and look forward to checking it out and using it in combination with Backbone.

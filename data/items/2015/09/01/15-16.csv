He doesn’t have to write, and if he doesn’t feel like it, he shouldn’t try. He can look out of the window, or stand on his head, or writhe on the floor. But he is not to do any other positive thing, not read, write letters, glance at magazines, or write checks. Write or nothing.<p>He commented somewhere that it works on the same principle as school - you can&#x27;t force children to learn, but if you prevent them from doing anything else, the bright ones will learn just to stave off boredom.",1441123165

You can find everything you need to learn (or progress) in your professional life. We have a strong product focus in which everything revolves around the users of our Dutch, German, UK, and US sites. Next to that, more and more organisations are using our SaaS tools to stimulate and manage learning for their employees.<p>Working at Springest<p>To strengthen our development team more, we are looking for a senior Ruby developer who can work independently. We don’t have managers at Springest, but processes, and we feel that individuals taking responsibility is very important. At Springest, you will work in a product team and in close collaboration with product owners, marketing, and sales colleagues. You are also a member of our development team where we discuss architecture, infrastructure, and keep a close watch on security and performance.<p>Your New Colleagues<p>At Springest you will work with around twenty colleagues who all are very skilled at what they do and almost all of them have a healthy dose of nerd skills that we really value. As a developer you fulfil an important role here that all your colleagues value and appreciate. Springeteers are a happy bunch and we often get together outside work to enjoy free time as well. Our office is a cosy place where anything goes and that we all take good care of together.<p>We are all active organisers and members of a lot of Meetups and other forms of knowledge exchange (learning is our hobby!) and we participate quite actively in the Amsterdam startup ecosystem. In addition to that we get a lot of attention for Springest being the poster boy of how HOLACRACY and GTD can work for an organisation, which in turn is due to our organisational structure without managers and other unnecessary overhead.<p>Our Data and Stack<p>At Springest you will work on our Ruby on Rails application on a daily basis. The app runs on AWS in Docker containers. You can read more about that on our blog.<p>We serve over 100 different SSL endpoints, among which are our APIs, Admin backend for learning providers, and of course our public websites. How we do that will soon be published on our blog.<p>At this time, we have over 150,000 courses by 5,000 providers in our Postgres database. Our users trust us with over 50,000 reviews already. Our exciting job is to maintain this ever scaling dataset.<p>It should not surprise you that our search engine is a core feature, for which we use Elasticsearch. We provide over 6,000 subjects in more than 150 categories with courses through this engine. We do personal recommendations for our users with it, taking their location, start dates, and many other factors into account that are important when choosing the right form of education.",1441123041

Which then destroys your cashflow, which means the typical &#x27;pay in 30 days&#x27; that is extremely common in business 2 business transactions gets messed up because Paypal froze your money. You can&#x27;t pay your supplier, your order doesn&#x27;t come in, meanwhile you&#x27;ve been shipping your product to your customers despite the fact all the revenue from these orders is getting insta-frozen, and now you&#x27;re starting to actually get legitimate issues of customers not getting their product because you can&#x27;t pay your supplier for new product and can&#x27;t ship to your customers, which makes Paypal clamp down ever harder to &#x27;resolve these issues before we unfreeze the account&#x27;, which of course is an issue they created and an issue that can&#x27;t be solved because they&#x27;re kidnapping your money.<p>So now you need to find external financing (we&#x27;re not talking about Amazon here, but commonly 1 or 2 people selling products from their home, the internet&#x27;s mom & pop stores) to fund the supplier&#x27;s order, then ship, cancel customer&#x27;s orders so you can prove to Paypal you can ship to every placed order (who leave negative feedback, understandably), and see customers cancel orders themselves (more negative feedback), and then unfreeze the money, pay back your financier, place another order with a supplier and hope to regain lost customers.<p>And that&#x27;s the simple story, the true story is extremely frustrating and much more complex with cashflow being frozen for 6 months while you&#x27;re trying to keep your business alive. Not everyone wants to recount it every time they want to criticise Paypal.<p>Now if there were legitimate concerns, cool. But as nailer said, you can find tons of stories of people who ran into these issues for no reason and without a reason given, without due dilligence and without the type of &#x27;reasonably swift&#x27; (i.e. days or at most weeks, not 6 months) recourse & resolution of frozen cashflow you need to run a business without going bankrupt.<p>A tip, if anyone ever does a product launch with Paypal, call them beforehand. Launching a product and selling in a spike the first days/weeks (i.e. extremely typical for virtually every launch ever) is a red flag for Paypal.<p>Which means for anyone doing a pre-order, well you&#x27;re fucked if you get unlucky. Plenty of stories of people doing a legitimate pre-order campaign with customers willing to wait say 2 months on the product. Halfway through your pre-order campaign you think &#x27;alright I&#x27;m at $60k right now, I&#x27;ll probably make it to $100k. I&#x27;ll start to order from my supplier about $80k&#x27;s worth for now to be on the safe side. You pay $25k of your own money upfront&#x27;. Campaign is over, you reached $100k, your supplier is busy, you call him up to adjust to $100k, and tell him you&#x27;ll pay the remaining $75k right away. Turns out all your money is frozen. Supplier won&#x27;t ship, Paypal won&#x27;t unfreeze the money for months. You inform your customers, they&#x27;re sad. 3% of them files a complaint with Paypal for a refund, which now means that 100% of Paypal&#x27;s feedback from customers about you is negative, seeing as you haven&#x27;t been able to ship to anyone yet.<p>You might think well good, Paypal protects its users from fraud (despite a total ignorance as to how normal pre-orders work, thereby screwing over their users), but this stuff happens to people who&#x27;ve done business with Paypal for 5-10 years. It happens to companies with solid internet reputations that takes 5 seconds to review on the internet or with a phonecall whether they&#x27;re legitimate.<p>And that&#x27;s the &#x27;normal&#x27; stuff, i.e. selling a videogame, a bracelet, a usb charger etc... But if we get to the really controversial stuff, like omg sex on video, I know I should use the p-word but I&#x27;ll just say it, porn... did that get censored?

If you really, truly, want to sell at any price(and I can&#x27;t imagine why, that is terrible trading), then you set your limit to zero.<p>Perhaps to avoid a margin call; your imagination is limited, you seem to forget you also have to buy/sell to exit a position when holding on is not an option. Terrible trading is holding on until you get margin called; when your risk management says get out, you get out. A stop loss isn&#x27;t a stop loss if it can fail to fill or only get partially filled, a market order is exactly what one desires in a stop loss.<p>> That&#x27;s all a market order is - a special case of a marketable limit order (immediate or cancel/fill and kill/etc) with the limit set to zero (in the case of a sell) or infinity (in the case of buy).<p>Yes, and thus no need to ban it.<p>> Banning vanilla market orders just forces people to acknowledge that fact, which is a good thing.<p>You can&#x27;t force people to acknowledge details they don&#x27;t care to know about.

The canonical analogy is making a baby:<p>- One woman can make a baby in nine months\n- Nine women can make nine babies in nine months\n- But nine women can&#x27;t make a baby in one month<p>Each step of fetal development depends on the previous step. For a given single baby, you can&#x27;t have one woman working on step #49 while another woman works on step #17.<p>A lot of computational tasks are similar. Think of the Fibonacci sequence: the computation of each number depends on previous results.<p>Reason #2: The overhead of communication and coordination. If you split up a task amongst 32 cores, those cores need to communicate with the parent process and perhaps with each other as well. This eats into your transistor budget.<p>Reason #3: Resource contention. It&#x27;s nice that you can split up your memory bandwidth-intense task across 128 cores, but if most of those cores are just sitting around and idling because of memory bandwidth contention issues, you haven&#x27;t gained anything.<p>Reason #4: It&#x27;s hard.

10153124,comment,10151286,10152490,0,0,Tenhundfeld,,,"What? If you accept the premise that talent is actually the capacity/inclination to work harder and practice more, then no, you won&#x27;t find anyone at the top of their field who overcame a lack of talent. That&#x27;s the point.<p>If you&#x27;re defining talent as some type of natural ability to be good at a learned skill, like playing an instrument, then I think there are many examples of people who weren&#x27;t especially good at first but became great.<p>For example, Michael Jordan was good but not outstanding at basketball in high school. He wasn&#x27;t actually &quot;cut&quot; from his high school team, as the urban legend is told, but as a sophomore, he was put on the JV team when at least one other sophomore was put on varsity. He worked harder and practiced more than others to get better. There are many anecdotes of other players, team trainers, etc., describing him as the &quot;hardest working&quot; and &quot;most competitive&quot; player they&#x27;ve ever met. Did he have some natural ability at basketball? Probably. But people who are close to him attribute his talent to his <i>drive</i> to be better than absolutely everyone else.<p>Another example is Jimi Hendrix. As a young boy, he carried around a broom and would pretend to play it as a guitar. When he finally got a guitar, he did not immediately belt out Purple Haze. He initially struggled with it as all new players do. Supposedly, he&#x27;d practice for several hours every day, often repeating a single note until he could make it sound exactly like a song on the radio. He slept with his guitar. He took it with him everywhere, practicing scales in any spare moments. He&#x27;d often go see blues musicians and pepper them with questions about technique. So, did he have some natural ability for the guitar? Probably. But stories from his early life point to his talent being a <i>love</i> of the guitar and a strong desire to master it, in part to escape poverty.<p>I think the point of all of this is that learned skills take time to master. There are obviously people for whom learning it is easier or harder, and there are physical and intellectual traits that can limit or promote mastery. But for most people, the key differentiator is practice and hard work.<p>Not everyone can become a concert pianist, but every concert pianist has worked extremely hard to achieve mastery.

We are heavily invested in Chef for configuration management, both at Engine Yard where we host our main applications, and also for newer infrastructure such as our custom-built CDN that we are tuning to deliver a better QoS than off-the-shelf vendors can provide.<p>The position is for the second engineer to be sitting next to me (Co-Founder & CTO) and our Head of Product in our San Francisco offices.  Although we were founded in Palo Alto, currently the CEO and bulk of our team is based in London due to the UK being our primary growth market.  We are now looking to move the product and engineering center of gravity to San Francisco in a run up to make the US a primary market in 2016 and beyond.  You would be #10 software engineer overall, and will play a strong role in defining the architecture of our application.  Strong ruby and rails skills are ideal, though this can be substituted by strong web and backend development skills in similar languages and architectures.  VoD and client-side video app development are a bonus but not required.  You will have significant opportunity to define your own position and work on any area of our technology where you can add value.<p>If you are interested please contact me by email, which can be found on my MUBI profile at <a href=""https://mubi.com/users/2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mubi.com/users/2</a>",1441121868

Our division of Connexity works in online display advertising (aka &quot;banner ads&quot;) through RTB, and we run 50 to 100 million impressions each day. Our total transaction volume is between 5 and 10 billion per day, and I&#x27;d bet you a burger we&#x27;ve served ads on nearly every site you&#x27;ve ever visited.<p>About Connexity:<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unlimited vacation; the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools.<p>We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship.<p>Position #1: Rails + exposure to Scala & Hbase<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work.<p>This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of interest (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms).<p>Position #2: Data Savvy, Impeccably Responsible<p>We need someone to help our Data Science team operations.  You&#x27;ll help us maintain and activate various data-driven ad targeting.  For example, a client may provide us a billion records which we need to analyze and transform into an audience segment.  This isn&#x27;t a software engineering position, but you&#x27;ll want to be (or learn to be) pretty capable at the command line, and able to work with Python/Bash or other scripting languages.  More than anything, we want someone who can maintain order among various client-facing tasks.  On paper, we have a neat structured process; in reality, we need someone with sound judgement and above-average clarity of thought and word to help drive us forward.

The assertion in this article seems deliberately calculated to undermine the historicity of Islam. There is a very sad and shortsighted movement in some corners of military scholarship right now that identifies Islam itself as the enemy, often beginning with Huntington&#x27;s &quot;clash of civilizations&quot; narrative and ending with some examples of sheer lunacy, such as the recent article by a West Point associate professor arguing that legal human rights scholars are &quot;an Islamist fifth column.&quot;<p>This is an article from a private news source about work done by academics at a private university, saying that the parchment MAY predate the accepted dates of Islam&#x27;s founding. How do you get from that to military scholarship and an attack on Islam?<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible (leaving aside the deficiencies in the radiocarbon dating) to believe that the accepted dates are incorrect without condemning Islam in any way. People frequently discuss errors in the histories of other religions (e.g. the Old Testament has god giving an incorrect value of Pi) without condemning their followers in any way.<p>tl;dr: &quot;undermine the historicity of Islam&quot; != &quot;condemning an entire religion&quot;",1441121764

Fifteen years ago, I went to work for &quot;BigCo&quot;, and while our group was essentially an internally funded start-up, I hated the politics, especially as we acquired other companies and tried to integrate their software products into ours.<p>The good news is that succeeding at three of the four start-ups left me with enough stock options to fund (my share) of my next start-up with cash.  While it&#x27;s looking like I may not see a return on that investment, the product was certainly something the industry needs/needed.  As a small boot-strapped company, it&#x27;s almost impossible to move an industry.<p>I&#x27;m currently working at a university and we&#x27;ve tailored the culture within our group to be much like you&#x27;d find in a start-up (the political machinations of a university can however be brutal).  In any case, I think I have a couple more ideas that could be turned into start-ups and enough working years left to build a couple more start-ups.  I can&#x27;t think of anything that&#x27;s more fun.<p>In contrast to you, I came from an upper-middle class family with a stay-at-home mom and a go-to-work dad.  Things were comfortable when I was at home but I&#x27;d have never asked any of my relatives for money to create a start-up and my parents were far more risk averse than I (originally they mildly disapproved of the risks I was taking but seem to have realized I always &quot;left myself an out&quot; so that in the worst possible outcome, I could take care of my wife and kids).<p>So it might be true that most kids these days have the money to be entrepreneurs, I say it was definitely in my genes.  (As an aside, in the &#x27;80s I think most of the start-ups I saw were people who were risking almost everything to get started because they had a vision - it&#x27;s much easier to fail if there are no consequences).",1441121627

Obviously all of the following depends upon your use case.<p>The main reason we continue to use Java is probably legacy reasons.  We have lots of library code.  And we&#x27;re a small shop, so every extra language we program in has a real cost associated with it.<p>The stability and backwards compatibility is great.  We have some libraries we haven&#x27;t had to touch in almost a decade, being used in apps we just wrote last week.  Of course some of them we&#x27;ve updated to use newer Java libraries (such as java.time and java.util.stream in Java 8).<p>IMHO Java&#x27;s biggest problem is the community.  It&#x27;s a bit enterprise-y.  As long as you don&#x27;t get caught up in that I think you&#x27;re OK.<p>I think the other problem was it went so long between Java 6 and Java 7.  With Java 8 there isn&#x27;t a lot from the likes of Python and Ruby I miss anymore.<p>For imperative languages, I generally like Go and Python better, because I find them &quot;funner&quot;.

10152975,comment,10151566,10152568,0,0,rebootthesystem,,,"No I don&#x27;t.<p>As many have pointed out in this thread, the world is full of entrepreneurs who come from very little and make it happen.<p>To me saying &quot;I have nothing&quot; is just an excuse.  Particularly in the US.  If you want to make something happen, you can, it will not be handed to you, but you can.<p>What these studies never look at (because it is virtually impossible) are the massive numbers of businesses that start from &quot;wealth&quot; and fail miserably.  I know people who were handed money and had no worries about failing.  And, guess what, most of them fail.  Why?  Frankly, I don&#x27;t know the exact mechanism.  It has to be similar to folks who win the lottery and proceed to implode within a year or two.  Or how about actors who make millions to shoot a movie in a few weeks and the best they can do with their lives in between movies is stuff drugs and alcohol into their bodies?<p>Nah, money may be a factor for some, but if someone doesn&#x27;t truly want to be an entrepreneur you can throw millions at them and they&#x27;ll just blow it.<p>Some of my favorite TV shows are &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; with Gordon Ramsay, &quot;The Profit&quot; with Marcus Lemonis, &quot;Make me a Millionaire Inventor&quot; with George Zaidan and Deanne Bell and, of course, &quot;Shark Tank&quot;.<p>I actually use them as teaching opportunities for my kids.  We record episodes, watch them together and have discussions over dinner.  The kids are good enough now that they can identify problems and patterns right away.  Now we pause episodes and have discussions prior to the conclusions being revealed.  The kids are getting a &quot;virtual MBA&quot; before they finish high school, which is great.<p>A common thread in a number of these shows are people who either inherit their businesses (lots of that in the restaurant show or The Profit) and proceed to run it into the ground.  Almost nothing could be a stronger demonstration that money isn&#x27;t a success factor in entrepreneurship than to see someone quite literally being HANDED a FULL WORKING BUSINESS only to proceed to destroy it.  Why?  Lack of focus, grit, drive, etc.  All the qualities I mentioned in my prior post.  I&#x27;ve seen shows where people end-up hundreds of dollars in debt because they simply had no engagement until someone from the outside slapped the shit out of them in a figurative way and got them to actually work on the business.<p>Money is just another tool, like 3D printer or a laptop.  Millions of people have very expensive laptops.  Most, from an entrepreneurial perspective, utterly waste them on Facebook and playing games.  At the other end of the scale, a true entrepreneur with grit and determination can grab a second hand piece of shit PC, load Linux into it, use a bunch of free tools, learn to code and make something happen.<p>Entrepreneurship isn&#x27;t about money.",1441121126

It&#x27;s land area is around 17,500 sq miles; a U.S. state of that size would be the 42nd largest, between West Virginia and Maryland.\nThat doesn&#x27;t diminish the services for thier citizens; to the extent that they enhance government through tech, that&#x27;s great. But if you are comparing countries, it&#x27;s much different to organize and service 1.3 than 300 million. In fact, if I were running a small nation (something I know nothing about), I might use that relative nimbleness as a competitive advantage.<p>But wouldn&#x27;t applying tech for very big populated countries would be better?\nI mean: the more people are contributing to an &quot;open source&quot; project, the better it is<p>So in the end, I feel like that if big countries would be more &quot;open&quot; by going in the e-government sense, we would have a &quot;Linux&quot; government (I admit that I really don&#x27;t know nothing about this, but I find this very interesting).<p>> 2) As a guess, Singapore?\nCould you give some key points to outline the difference between Singapore and Estonia?<p>> 3) Does e-government include the governmental service of spying on citizens?\nWell, there is room to improvement concerning this issue, right?\nThere is a lot of effort towards privacy matters, and in the end, people will fight for it, so can we suppose that the &quot;spy citizens&quot; thing will be solved at any moment?<p>(By the way, I feel that I&#x27;m more spied in my country -France- than in an e-government country like Estonia, reminder that a spying law was passed and everything is okay in France...)",1441120411

Most jobs are the result of economic specialization.  When everyone does the one thing that they are best at, and trade the fruits of their efforts, the whole economy is more productive.<p>The traditional example is a carpenter and electrician building houses.  Now, the electrician is a genius, and he can actually frame a house faster than the carpenter.  This is how long it takes them for each task, and wiring has to occur after the framing is completely done:<p><pre><code>  Task       |Framing|Wiring|\n  -----------+-------+------+\n  Electrician|   44h |  24h |\n  Carpenter  |   48h |  56h |\n  -----------+-------+------+\n</code></pre>\nIf the Electrician built his own house, he finishes at 68h.  If the Carpenter built his own, he gets done at 104h.<p>If they instead have the Carpenter do all the framing, and the Electrician do all the wiring, the first house is done at 72h, and the second is done at 120h.  (If the Electrician helps to frame whenever not wiring, and the Carpenter helps to wire whenever not framing, completion time for each house is shorter at 47h and 75.5h, but that&#x27;s outside the scope of this example.)  The Electrician only had to do 48h of work instead of 68h, a savings of 20h, and the Carpenter only had to do 96h instead of 104h, a savings of 8h.  Both benefited from the specialization, even though the Carpenter is actually slower at framing than the Electrician.  They have an additional advantage in that they only need one complete set of tools rather than two.  The Electrician takes the wiring tools, and the Carpenter takes the framing tools.<p>They are not refusing to do jobs they don&#x27;t want to do.  They are doing the jobs they are best at doing because it makes them more productive.<p>If you want to start or support a family, travel, pursue interesting hobbies, socialize with friends, experience local culture, or bump any of the metrics you may have for personal success, having money makes all of those things easier and less stressful.  The stress from the acquisition of that money is usually less in magnitude than the advantage it imparts.<p>Most people stop working harder when doing so would detract from their overall enjoyment of life.  Most.<p>As the Dickens quote from David Copperfield goes:<p><pre><code>  Annual income twenty pounds,\n  annual expenditure nineteen six,\n  result happiness.\n  Annual income twenty pounds,\n  annual expenditure twenty pound ought and six,\n  result misery.\n</code></pre>\nWhen survival needs are largely commoditized, the more you earn in excess of your baseline, the more opportunity you have to make choices with whatever is left.  If you like simple pleasures, low earnings are enough to make you happy.  But many people measure success in part by how much they can provide for other people&#x27;s needs in addition to their own.  If you can get all your kids to graduate college without any of them needing loans, I think that&#x27;s a big success.  And you mostly need plain old money to do that.  So you specialize in a job and earn money so that you can help everyone else specialize through trade.<p>If you can specialize in a skill in high demand that few other people are any good at (like engineering), you will almost automatically be successful.",1441119705

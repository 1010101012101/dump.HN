So while you state speed and range metrics the real question is the quality, capability and environmentals you&#x27;re, likely, not taking into consideration.<p>Quality: not all antenna or radios are at all equal. Just because you have an N capable AP means nothing for client connectivity.<p>Capability: Is your AP MIMO? How many TX & RX? These things matter. Many of Apple&#x27;s designs for Airport look pretty but are effectively junk for RF performance. This has always been a clear case of aesthetic over function. Many people often buy all in one devices to handle 30Mbps Internet connections and also lump in 10 wireless and wired devices. These wireless &#x27;enabled&#x27; devices are often horrible since they&#x27;re often underpowered to handle the increased connection speeds as local transfer and Internet speeds increase.<p>Environmentals: Do you live in a shared living space with lots of neighbors contending for use of channels?

Now, I won&#x27;t pretend that I&#x27;d expect the German government to cancel his speech, but I&#x27;d hope at least some hard questions would be asked.<p>I mean, Germans know exactly what happens when surveillance gets out of control - the Wikipedia page about the Stasi [1] is pretty good, including lines such as &quot;counting part-time informers, the Stasi had one informer per 6.5 people&quot; and &quot;As the GDR began to fall, the Stasi did as well. They began to destroy the extensive files that they had kept, both by hand and with the use of shredders. When these activities became known, a protest erupted in front of the Stasi headquarters&quot;. Can anyone imagine US citizens storming the NSA, or the FBI? Even today those files are being reassembled, because people wants to know what happened.<p>And yet, what happened during the conference [2]? Angela Merkel essentially stepping in defense of Obama. She could have said she didn&#x27;t agree. She could have remained quiet. And yet she speaks (mildly, though) in his favor, even while by her own admission &quot;the questions have not yet been satisfactorily addressed&quot;.

This project drastically increases the resolution of this roadmap.<p>However the additional information needed is what traffic is carried by each road.\nThe brain as we understand it today consists not just of the connections between the neurons but also that each neuron, and each different network of the brain, secretes it&#x27;s own neurotransmitter. Because some of these neurotransmitters are depolarising and some are inhibitory, and they connect widely across the brain and are much more closely related to the actual information processing, we need to have this information before we will be able to better approximate a brain.<p>In all likelihood this is information gathering is probably underway right now. From what I understand the &#x27;BigBrain&#x27; project aims to do for the human brain what the Allen Brain atlas did for mouse brains, that is not only provide a map of the connections but also stain for gene expression and (from memory) neurotransmitter presence.<p>With this added information we will be closer to our goal of getting skynet sentient.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bluebrain.epfl.ch/</a>",1371816185

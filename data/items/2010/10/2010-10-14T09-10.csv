Every place can be reimplemented using an updatable cache, starting from the slower parts.<p>Strategy #2: Use Redis directly as the data store, killing the need of a cache.<p>This needs a major redesign, but probably it can be done incrementally starting from #1, because when using Redis as a smart cache you write both the code to read and update the cache, so eventually killing the code that updates the ""real"" database will make Redis the only store, or it is possible to still retain the code updating the old data store just to have another copy of the whole dataset where it is easy to run complex queries for data mining and so forth, that is something an SQL database does well but Redis does not.<p>I think that David King evaluated Redis in contrast to Cassandra, and he did not liked the lack of cluster solution with failover, resharding and so forth (what we are tying to do with redis cluster), but I think he missed part of the point that Redis can be used in many different ways, more as a flexible tool than a pre-cooked solution, and in their case the ""smart cache"" is probably the best approach.<p>If Reddis will reconsider the issue giving Redis a chance I'm here to help.",1287047622

Then I went door to door to each restaurant and showed them the websites, live online.<p>The restaurant owners wouldn't need to do anything. They could assume possession of the website that very day (I would only need to change some pictures and change the website name from ""Your Family Restaurant"" to their name).<p>Guess what... I only moved one, and even that one was a special deal. I couldn't even rent the other websites out for a small monthly fee.<p>I figure it wasn't a price point as much as they just didn't see the value in having a website. If they did, they'd already have a website.<p>Lesson: Let people come to you. Let them have the need first.<p>BTW: Every now and then, late at night, I'll get a takeout order for lettuce wraps and fried rice (sigh).",1287047617

1790313,comment,1789861,1789861,0,0,csallen,,,"As a programmer who has perused hundreds of job postings in the past, I'm inclined to agree with the author that the HN post was a good one. Yes, some of it is bullshit (the napping part), but most of it is great. It's quite specific and does a good job differentiating itself from many other postings. Here's what I think when I read it:<p><i>> ""we’re looking to hire a smart all-around programmer""</i><p>Looks like I'm gonna have to be a jack-of-all trades rather than a master of one. That's good, definitely my style.<p><i>> ""as our first hire.""</i><p>A lot will be expected of me. I'll have to be self-motivated and self-organized. No slacking. Long hours. This is a legitimate <i>startup</i> job.<p><i>> ""It’s a cliche, but we want people who like tackling complicated problems.""</i><p>Yep, cliche. I like that you point it out though, makes me take this requirement more seriously. I happen to enjoy working through complicated problems, no reservations here.<p><i>> ""Depending on the task, we program in Ruby (on Rails), Javascript (a lot of this), PHP, Python, Objective-C (iPhone), and Java (Android). Flexibility is a plus.""</i><p>Great, specifics. Once again, focusing on the jack-of-all trades thing. They're clearly at a point where they can't (and probably shouldn't) hire specialists.<p><i>> ""we like people who don’t put themselves in a box. You should be comfortable thinking about the product as a whole, and how changes are going to impact the hundreds of thousands of people who use it regularly.""</i><p>In other words, this is a startup, we don't want stereotypical big company guys. I can't just blend in. I'll have a lot of responsibility, and I'll be making a lot of real decisions. I'm basically a co-founder who's a little late to the game.<p><i>> ""make the lives of hundreds of thousands of people better every month""</i><p>Hmmm, they seem to care about the social impact of their product. Probably a good thing, but could be a bad/annoying thing if taken to an extreme.<p><i>> ""napping is an encouraged part of our corporate culture.""</i><p>Probably bullshit. I don't have any real desire to nap on the job, but I'll definitely ask for details out of curiosity.<p><i>> We’re profitable ... have a rapidly expanding user base</i><p>That's cool, but I'd like to know more. Ramen profitable or Rolls Royce profitable? 500 new users a day or 5000 users a day? They seem to be trying to sell me on this point, so if I get an interview I'm going to find out more specifics. It's good that they care about profits though, I do too.<p><i>> Basically, you’ll get to be the first employee of a small successful startup, while getting a paycheck and equity</i><p>Cool. Always good to list what I'll be getting. Will ask about benefits, not expecting any though.<p><i>> and feeling good about the impact you’re having on the world.</i><p>Another reference to social impact. I have to ask myself, am I the kind of person who would consider ""being a do-gooder"" more than a negligible part of the recompense for the long, stressful hours of startup life? Not a lot of people will stay up coding til 3AM Saturday night and say, ""Hey, at least I did some good for someone out there.""",1287047202

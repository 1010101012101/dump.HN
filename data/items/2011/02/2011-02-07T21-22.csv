They allow the user to do things <i>fast</i>. For people who want to take the time and effort to master an interface, they're superior to mouse centric UIs. For people who want to be able to sit down and use something right away without having to read a manual, they're horrible. The discovery of such UIs consists of ""RTFM"".<p>Mouse centric UIs should be easier for people who haven't used the program before. The functions should be fairly obviously labeled and easy to click on. For those unfamiliar with the program, at least its basic functionality should be immediately obvious. However, without some form of keyboard shortcut, they tend to be slower and more frustrating for more experienced or technical users who want to simply get stuff done.<p>All of this is just IMHO of course. I tend to prefer UIs that are essentially not there. My Firefox consists of a pentadactyl command line/status bar, and the TreeStyleTab sidebar. The browser UI is completely out of my way, and I know how to do what I want with just the keyboard, mostly. However, when people sit down and try to use my Firefox, they have no idea how the hell to even begin. (Whether this is a bug or a feature is up to you. :)",1297115902

2190887,comment,2190166,2190540,0,0,kleinsch,,,"Definitely. When classroom discipline is solely the teacher's responsibility, the teacher ends up spending all their time enforcing discipline and no time teaching. My girlfriend did Teach for America in the bad parts of Washington, DC and there were veteran teachers there who didn't have as much trouble with discipline because they were basically glorified babysitters. They didn't really teach anything, but they made sure students showed up and didn't kill each other. Works great for keeping things under control, but the kids are completely screwed as far as their education goes.<p>I don't think the commenters saying that discipline is the teacher's responsibility understand the circumstances involved in some of these schools. We're talking about kids pulling knives on each other or throwing desks, not passing notes in the back of the class.<p>The teacher also has no control over how much the parents (or in many cases grandparents) will help. My girlfriend had one kid who had to be suspended for throwing a chair at her. When he came back, he said that while he was suspended his dad took him out on a boat and got him ice cream. Suspension was more fun than going to school, so is it surprising that his behavior never changed?",1297114586

Then, I would try to persuade the IBM execs not to ditch CP/M-86 for PC-DOS.

I think the Boston Globe is a legit publication, but I was not familiar with Jeff Jacoby. Although he writes well, I became wary at his first reference to the American Enterprise Institute, so I did a little research.<p>I must admit that my suspicions were confirmed. The sole purpose of the AEI, and similar type organizations on both sides of the political spectrum, is to espouse and promote an ideology. The introduction (Message from the Chairman and President) to their 2010 annual report state, “AFI is showing that liberty, opportunity, and entrepreneurship are not only good economic principles, but moral imperatives.” I have learned to beware whenever anyone claims to know the Truth and talks about “moral imperatives” Such rhetoric has been used to justify the worst atrocities and most hateful acts of terrorism in human history.<p>I was also unfamiliar with Mark Perry, one of the moral authorities cited by Jacoby.  In addition to being a “visiting scholar” at the AEI, Perry is a member of the Board of Directors of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, an orthodoxy right-wing “think tank” based in Michigan.<p>According to the Michigan Education Association, ""The role of the Mackinac Center is to change public opinion and move public policy toward the political right. The Mackinac Center does not conduct neutral or objective scholarship. Rather, it provides the media and government officials with publications designed to promote and advance its conservative agenda.""  If any doubt remains about Jacoby’s objectivity or the reliability of his sources, a visit to the AEI website reveals their Board of Directors includes none other than The Honorable Richard B. Cheney.<p>Based on what little I was able learn, Jacoby, a rightwing taking head who was recruited by the Globe to add balance (or the appearance of balance) to their otherwise liberal editorial page, would feel at home in the company of the former VP. In fairness to Jacoby, he is neither a journalist nor a social scientist.  His writes editorials that express a point of view.  His job does on included conducting scientific research with the intent of objectively depicting reality.</i><p>In other words, consider the source. There's nothing more that the captains of industry would like to peddle more than American manufacturing is great. The real story is the jobs have been sent over seas and the executive pay has been increased at the top for efficiency.",1297114428

Paternalistic laws/rules very often rub the most responsible members of society the wrong way when they apply them to themselves.  Moreover, applying rules for children to adults will also push your intuitions in a certain way.<p>Believing in a kid's potential to be a productive member of society, I'd argue, is an even more edifying way of acknowledging their status as a human being.  Your version when applied to poor city kids is basically, ""sure, it's cool if you want to go become a vandal/drug dealer/future inmate; whatever.""<p>Also, you're giving kids too much credit.  Kids will almost always maximize short term payoff at the expense of long term success (hyperbolic discounting?). And good parenting is about balancing those inclinations.

Small startups rarely have the staff and time horizon to invest in creating systems that require technical skills beyond the ability to use an API.  So if you work at a small startup that doesn't have the capacity to invest in custom low-level solutions, don't be surprised if your CS skills are not utilized.",1297112931

I think that kids are people, not slaves of the state or of their parents. I am not advocating simply abandoning kids who are not interested in attending school; instead, I'd like to see a variety of educational, vocational, and artistic services available for them, free of charge, which they can take advantage of whenever THEY come to the conclusion that they want to do so. I'd like those services to be easy to access, with no red tape involved, and I'd like them to be well publicized and well known within the community.<p>I simply don't understand how allowing kids the freedom to make their own decisions about what they want to learn and when they want to learn it can be anything but a good thing. Must everyone be subject to coercion and force from the earliest ages? Do we have to crush the genuine love of learning most children are born with under the boot of an oppressive school environment they have no choice but to be a part of?<p>My views on this topic are derived in part from my own experience, but they have also been shaped a great deal by the writings of John Holt. For those who are interested, I'd recommend How Children Fail as a great book to start with; it has really been influential in my thinking about education and the nature of school.",1297112662

(host these videos on the top 5 major video hosting sites including itunes)<p>Also embed these videos into your daily or weekly blog on your own site while incorporating sharable options for users to share your page with others. (transcribe your video blog into text for SEO benefits)<p>2) Add facebook and twitter badges on all of your sites pages for people to become a fan or follow on twitter (this is like a mailing list)<p>3) SEM (PPC) through Google adwords, yahoo search marketing, facebook ad network, linked-in ad network.<p>4) Leverage well known blogs in your industry and ask to place an ad in their email newsletter or ask for a solo ad.<p>5) write guest blogs on related blogs within your industry while writing a review about your site and placing a like back to you. (check sites link reviewme.com etc..)<p>6) Get a writer to write a press release then send it though the top 3 PR sites online. (don't bank on this too much)<p>7) Use tweet adder to find relevant topics to your industry people are talking about as well as people who state your keywords in their profiles. add them and contact them to offer free offers. (help them first... give then get)<p>8) use twitter by hooking in google's voice tweet app through your phone and constantly be tweeting about relevant topics in your industry. As natural as possible. replace your twitter background with one which shows links to your site. (also add link in your profile)<p>9) create a facebook fanpage and start adding the same tweets to the status.<p>10) Find podcast websites which talk or interview in your industry. They are always looking for content or wanting to interview related topics. become an interviewee.<p>11) create 10 unique relevant infographics and post them up on your blog while trying to promote them on stubmleupon and digg.<p>12) Find biz or dev partners where you can leverage their audience and they can leverage your technology or your audience.<p>13) Start a little beef. Find a fellow blogger who is interested in playing an intense back and forth argument about a sensitive topic in your industry.  Both of you will reap rewards.<p>14) Don't forget to provide an incentive for users who refer users through your site. Provide a free whitepaper, space(mb), internal credits etc...<p>15) Allow potential partners to become affiliates for your site. (will need to plug in a app to your site for this) Then contact the top 50 relevant bloggers in your industry and tell them about it via email or even ask to call them.<p>Just a few off the top of my head in addition to ones stated by others.<p>Try them out, hope these helped.",1297112465

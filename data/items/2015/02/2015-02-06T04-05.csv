Breaking news is very often inaccurate. No amount of fact checking can fix it because in most cases no other news is available to counter the initial report. Unless you have reporters on the ground who can provide a more accurate report, you can&#x27;t hope to improve that report. When a later report becomes available it becomes the newest report.<p>Like Infobitt, you appear to be aiming for a metric of quality (&quot;accuracy&quot;) that the market doesn&#x27;t care about that much. Take the recent plane crash in Taiwan as an example. At first it was reported that there were one or two casualties. Later reports said 13 dead. Most people are like &quot;Oh really?&quot; But, even though the first report is less accurate, it has more value to people than the second (unless you have family on the plane).<p>As for the distribution of news, unless you are Facebook you have no control over how news is shared. In fact, most people don&#x27;t care about the casualties, they just want to share the video of the plane crashing across the bridge.",1423198742

It&#x27;s big, complicated, dangerous, and expensive equipment that is comparable in cost to the tractors discussed in this article.  The products employ a number of measures to prevent end-users from tampering with things that shouldn&#x27;t be tampered with (especially the firmware).  Partly this is to discourage piracy.  But mainly this is done because the equipment is quite complicated and there are not many people in the world who understand the technology well enough to make repairs on their own.  It&#x27;s very easy to cause unintentional errors that can cause much more serious damage than the original minor problem.  And when the failure of your equipment can cause serious property damage, injury, or death are you going to make it easy for people to modify your product&#x27;s firmware?",1423198495

9007782,comment,9007082,9007491,0,0,orbifold,,,"The answer to this question has changed over time. My knowledge of the history is incomplete to say the least. During the first super string revolution, when it was understood that perturbative string theory would give a description of perturbative quantum gravity, the goal was to demonstrate that there were only a few choices of compactification manifolds available from consistency arguments (anomaly cancellation and unbroken super symmetry in four dimensions, probably the most well known paper is &quot;Vacuum configurations for superstrings&quot; by Candelas et. al.)<p>Ignoring heaps of details, the result was that the vacuum manifold (that is a solution to the 10d vacuum Einstein Equations) had to be some 4 dimensional symmetric space (usually taken to be Minkowsky Space) times a Calabi-Yau manifold, those are Kaehler manifolds with vanishing Ricci curvature (those have non-vanishing constant spinors, which you need for unbroken supersymmetry).<p>Initially it was believed that with additional physical consistency conditions and by relating the geometry of the Calabi-Yau manifold to known physical parameters, like the number of generations of particles, it would be possible to narrow down the number of &quot;stable&quot; vacua to a limited number.<p>While there were discovered a fair amount of dualities between different string theories, with the discovery of D-Branes and Flux Compactifications (which stabilize the moduli  of a huge number of potential vacua, the general idea is that the space of calabi-yau manifolds can locally be paramterized as a finite dimensional manifold and those paramters would show up as massless fields that aren&#x27;t observed, if there weren&#x27;t any fluxes they couple to), the number of potentially stable vacua is now sometimes quoted as 10^500.<p>In itself this is not too concerning, if you think about the fact that there is a infinite number of solutions to the Einstein Field equations and general relativity is still a very predictive theory. In practice this means that you carefully engineer the vacua you study, for example with F-theory techniques in order to relate them to observed phenomena.<p>You are right that it just reframes the question, the low energy effective field coupling constants turn up as vacuum expectation values of certain fields, but in an interesting way. The idea is then to use relations and identities discovered in string theory (for example AdS-CFT) to study the low energy theories.",1423198456
9007781,comment,9003898,9003898,0,0,swatow,,,"I think the problem with this sort of thing is it doesn&#x27;t capture the beauty and elegance of either Haskell or physics.  Take the first line<p><pre><code>  data Vec = Vec { xComp :: Double
    , yComp :: Double
    , zComp :: Double }
</code></pre>
The author has just defined a 3d vector.  But there is no &quot;3&quot; in the above because Vec is hardcoded to be three dimensional.  The physics student is probably interested in what aspects of physics are special to 3 dimensions, and which generalize to higher dimensions.  I think geometric/Clifford algebra somewhat answers this, but my knowledge is limited.  Anyway, functional programming is still at the stage when the things that it can express about mathematics, are actually pretty obvious already.  I have high hopes for the future (e.g HoTT), but for now functional programming is much more exciting for programmers than physicists or mathematicians (who aren&#x27;t logicians or category theorists).",1423198421

You know the imam Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, who started the wahabism. This imam aligned with the great grandfather of the present royal saud family, in many ways: fighting against ottomans, through marriage.  At one point, Ottoman empire through its proxy Egypt fought wahabi and al-saud, even excecuted one of the great grand fathers of the current royal saudi family.<p>In other words, the elements that are against USA are not tiny: they constitute the half of the foundation of current Saudi state. Royal Saudi family is the product of Al-Wahhab and Al-Saud; and they have married into tribes that scattered around Saudi, when they reclaimed Saudi.<p>Just saying that fringe elements of Saudi royal family are against USA is bullshit.<p>You know, who support USA in the saudi family? Only those billionaire types. The founder of Saudi Arabia had ~ 25 kids, each producing another 25, producing another 25. So, there are about 16000 royal family members. Majority of them are not wealthy. The kids of founder get $3M per annum, his grandsons get $300K per annum, his great grand sons get $30K per annum.<p>There is another reason why these princes breed 20 kids: just to get that monthly stipend, as the welfare starts right at birth.<p>The people who support USA are the king, crown prince, and interior minister, etc. So, basically 5 to 10 princes!! Even if you add 10 more, you have the support of 20 princes off of 16000 of all princes.",1423197769

My argument to him stands IMO, that your understanding of what constitutes a valid side channel attack is fundamentally flawed in any case.<p>First, lets start with: All of the library and showcase pieces are WAN material. If you bothered to look, you would have noticed that all of the necessary blinding is performed for all cryptographic operations as received, thus even for LAN access, thanks to blinding as widely accepted mitigation strategy, no timing information is leaked.<p>Second, if you bothered to actually peruse the implementation, you would have noticed that when it receives a bad HMAC, instead of reporting that differently to the would-be attacker, it randomizes the expected packet length, thereby rendering timing information based solely on the TLS and/or SSH state mechanism useless.<p>Third, padding related issues are treated the same, such that no attacker-perspective notifications are broadcast.<p>Fourth, the TLS Blacklist feature I added was only an additional, and IMO decent server-side mitigation technique insofar as during normal operations, decrypt operations do not fail, and if they do, why give an attacker the opportunity to perform 32M+ tests against my implementation?<p>In any case, as mentioned specifically on my rwasa page, I left the TLS Blacklist feature disabled for my own website due to the ssllabs.com security scans being incorrect if it is enabled.<p>In summary, my speed increases are not due to shortcutting security protocols or best practices, but the fact that my modular exponentiation routines in x86_64 assembler are indeed faster.<p>Please send me my private key to 2ton.com.au and I will take the whole lot down immediately.",1423197713

Sure, in the past, it may have been reasonable for the labels to take on large fees for distribution -- but that&#x27;s when it meant manufacturing tons of plastic and vinyl and then shipping it to thousands of record stores around the globe.

Presumably Mike Masnick also thinks that CD revenues were never used to pay off the expenses of vinyl pressing or promotional swag. He&#x27;s probably also oblivious to the fact that many musical acts lose money and until they become profitable any incoming revenue will be used to pay off money advanced by the label. And the lowish (IMHO) payouts from services like Spotify don&#x27;t go as far as some other revenue sources when it comes down to paying off the up-front expenses.<p>Is Mike Masnick really this stupid, or does he just like pandering to his readers&#x27; ignorance? these statistics are <i>meaningless</i> absent any context of profit and loss for the labels.

The project is called AutoTeach, and is a way to supplement video game time with constructive educational activity. I have developed a simple, open source credit-meter/router using a Raspberry-Pi running Gentoo Linux which solves the micro-management issues that arise when trying to supplement ones&#x27; childrens&#x27; education.<p>The other half of the system are the educational activities. For these there is a website built to accommodate open source, GPL-v3&#x27;d contributions from developers. All software in the project is GPL-v3 licensed. Activities are developed in JavaScript with no dependencies, except jQuery (optional). There is no lock-in. All software activities can lead a completely free and independent life outside the platform.<p>The project also involves a new economic model whereby parent-subscribers pay a modest subscription fee, which they have the option to distribute among develpers of their choice. This scheme maintains engagement between the user and developer communities, which is something that is often lacking. The ongoing engagement and compensation of developers is expected to accelerate and advance the overall state of open source education software.<p>The system is built and functioning with 3 prototype activities. I am looking for more early adopters, developers, and participants in general, so that we may reach the critical mass at which the system can self-sustains in true synergistic symbiosis.<p>Anyone intrigued by this is encouraged to consider becoming involved via our Kickstarter campaign, which goal is to recruit early adopters by providing the AutoTeach credit-meter at cost. In addition to Kickstarter you are invited to join the forums or connect in any other way. Please note that the project webpages, including Kickstarter, are currently undergoing simplification and clean-up.<p>http://www.asymptopia.org/autoteach<p>Charles Cossé",1423196229

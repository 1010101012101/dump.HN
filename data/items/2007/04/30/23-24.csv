18249,comment,18201,18201,0,0,timg,,,"99.9999% of the views of reddit and similar are people wanting to see what the hottest current news is. Are you really going to hide it from them?<p>If not, then are you going to make some votes not count as much as others? Users will hate this.<p>Another problem is not counting votes from people who go directly to the page!?! Sorry but that is completely asinine. Those blog ""digg it""-like widgets are the best form of marketing that these news sites have. If the votes are worthless then the bloggers will ditch you fast.",1177976668
18248,comment,18154,18154,0,0,sabat,,,"""He started at least two after Apple, ACIUS (makers of 4D) and Fog City Software.""<p>I don't know anything about Fog City Software (so this probably makes me partially wrong), but he did not start ACIUS. He took over as CEO from one of the founders (chronicled in The Macintosh Way -- and just to prove I'm not a Guy-hater, I have a signed copy of that book). :-) He did start garage.com, so I suppose you could count that as a startup. But he was already rich by the time he did all that stuff (AAPL stock), so in my book, it doesn't really count. He didn't have that feeling of almost-desperation that a lot of us have. He could have just spent his life yachting if he had wanted to.<p>\n""not so much if you want to be the next Sergey Brin""<p>Yeah, I think that's really what bugs me, too -- the Trumpish thing. A lot of his posts seem to suggest ""the rules"" on how you get a job, how you run a business, how you do a startup, etc. And I don't tend to agree with him -- or I end up finding his point-of-view sort of elitist. ""Here's the right way to do X, except the right way is something you probably cannot do because you a) don't know the right people, or b) don't already have tons of cash."" That type of thing.<p>Or maybe he means really well but just rubs some people the wrong way. ",1177976559

18246,comment,17980,18066,0,0,awj,,,"""The reason why I don't like drugs: if they are so beneficial, why doesn't the body produce them by itself? It seems to me evolution would have figured out a way to do that by now. If it hasn't, maybe there are some side effects that diminish fitness.""<p>You are forgetting the other side to evolutionary fitness: the environment. Human evolution has been progressively stagnated by the invention of adaptive technology. Being hard of hearing or nearly blind is no longer a deadly condition, hence it no longer prevents procreation, hence evolution doesn't factor anymore.<p>The human genetic structure is largely the same as it was hundreds if not thousands of years ago precisely because we can use tools to adapt to situations much faster than any evolutionary fitness can proof out and spread through the population.<p>As for the memory gene of mice, that would only have been important if a better memory made mice more successful at what they do. Evidently in the environments mice adapted to this was not the case.<p>""Of course evolution might have another ""idea"" of what is good for us than we do (evolution doesn't really care about us).""<p>Evolution doesn't have ideas. It does not use reason. It does not think. It exists purely as a pattern of change in species over time. There is no need to give it more credit than that, it is quite powerful enough without the addition of sentience.",1177976459

18240,comment,18231,18232,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"I can agree that there are opportunities both in busts and booms.  However, nobody wants to be working on an over-hyped project.  And it would definitely be helpful to know if you are.<p>Even if your startup is solid, knowing the condition of the market is still important.  For example, if there is a bubble, a profitable company might want to seek financing before it ""bursts.""  You'll get a higher valuation, and therefore give away less equity.<p>Sure, you shouldn't let worries about ""bubble 2.0"" prevent you from starting your company.  But it'd be foolish not to try to learn from the mistakes made in the '90s.",1177975516

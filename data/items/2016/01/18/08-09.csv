I use Clang, GNUstep and my own rewrite of UIKit.<p>Possibly this is just Stockholm syndrome, but the more I use Obj-C, the more I like it. It uses reference counting, so memory overhead is low and consistent, and running time is consistent. It&#x27;s not fast, true, but in my case most of the running time is spent in OpenGL anyway. Plain C is always there at your fingertips for crucial inner loops. Newer features like properties and for-each loops make it fairly pleasant to use. The standard Foundation library is pretty well-designed.<p>The one thing it&#x27;s possibly missing is generics (Apple added that feature recently but I haven&#x27;t tried it yet). Without generics, it feels a bit like a reference-counted Go -- that slight scripting language feel but with native speed.<p>The one big downside... On non-Apple platforms, the tooling is very patchy, and new features can take a while to arrive. If Apple is really serious about open-sourcing Swift, that could help a lot. I imagine there&#x27;ll be more interest in new shiny Swift than crufty old Obj-C, but Obj-C is still a nice little language.<p>[Edit: capitalization of GNUstep :)]",1453107575

There&#x27;s another aspect:  It highlights that the question itself was disingenuous.  No one was seriously asking whether people can read articles like these.<p>It&#x27;s true that all of this is beside the point, and that the only mod action here was to request that they not conduct themselves badly.

It is reasonable for the mortgage lender to make the loan because such contracts are enforceable in court, and it can count on the state to seize the house from a delinquent borrower even if the bank itself owns fewer guns than the occupant.

Consider how factors such as your own personal energy levels affect your decision making throughout the day (decision fatigue)...how are we going to model something like that with AI? Or consider that many different cultures around the world have very different societal goals than Americans do pursuing personal freedom and material well-being. How do we consider those different abstract goals, that most citizens don&#x27;t even realize or understand why they pursue, because it&#x27;s just how they have been raised. How do environmental factors drive decision making in different climates? Those who live in a very cold climate have to take different precautions and deal with different risks than those in warm climates do. What about locally available resources? Many business (and design) decisions are made based as much upon supply chain availability and risk management as they are customer demand. How does AI consider these factors when AI doesn&#x27;t even know these things exist? These are the things I was talking about that we still have difficulty understanding about each other, let alone being able to program a robot to imitate.",1453107419

Eating keto often means eating separate foods altogether from your family/peers, and your choices when eating out become limited and/or disproportionately expensive[0].

10923322,comment,10922162,10922162,0,0,alberte,,,"I think in all these discussions of bean counters, the underlying assumptions non bean counters make is that the bean counters are trying to improve things. That, in my experience, is seldom the case. Mostly the act of bean counting is to create positions for bean counters, and insert themselves into the process. There is no end game in this, they will happily have meetings to discuss processes and improve metrics, because to them, bean counting is all there is. Without bean counting they would be unemployed. Once you let them in, you&#x27;re screwed, cause they&#x27;re impossible to get out.<p>Edit: Why the down vote? Perhaps some argument? (Oh, of course, it was probably a bean counter)<p>I posted this as a very real comment - once you accept that what you are doing is an item measurable by parties that aren&#x27;t professionals in your field (bean counters) then any qualitative aspects of the profession are lost. Only the quantifiable is left, and because the bean counter doesn&#x27;t communicate using the language of the profession - you are forced to learn their language. A language of quantifiables and reduction to line items. The rise of the professional manager who has necessarily no expertise in the field they are managing must of necessity reduce all non quantifiables to a 0 value. Thus you end up in the pickle that educators and physicians find themselves in. In the past administration was performed by members of the profession and so they could communicate using the same language.",1453107063

You&#x27;d usually get Linus&#x27; style rant about how C++ sucks so bad and C is the epitome of simplicity and design. I wholeheartedly agree with you that both languages are lacking, and I&#x27;m also waiting until Rust or another language grows mature enough to replace both of them in most cases.<p>But I think most of the main points you describe as impossible in C++ are actually completely possible. It means moving away from the 90&#x27;s paradigm of using C++ to implement deep class hierarchies with design pattern, but after all C++ is a multi-paradigm language. If you can do data-oriented design in C, you could most certainly do it in C++, and the abstractions C++ provides actually make it easier.<p>In essence, I would separate game objects to a logic instance and state objects (pure structs) and use smart pointers with a generation-counter to point the logic instance, which in turn would have smart a pointer to the state struct. The smart pointer would overload the dereference operator and transparently update the logic instance to get the new vtable if needed.<p>This decoupling of state and logic could do many nice things, such as serializing the entire game state in a very clean way, and pure state structs would not be harder to parse than C structs (they would essentially <i>be</i> C structs), so you can still have your memory editor.<p>The main difference between C and C++ here would be the cost abstractions, both cognitive and performance-wise. I have to admit I&#x27;ve never ran into standard abstractions significantly slowing optimized debug code, except for standard library containers. I&#x27;m not a game programmer though, so YMMV. I get the cognitive cost argument, but for me the cognitive cost of C (namely having boilerplate noise scattered all over hiding the interesting code and having to be super-extra-careful with memory management) is higher than than the cognitive cost of internalizing all the layers of abstraction in C++.<p>If you&#x27;re programming a network game, I still think you&#x27;d do your users a better service if you don&#x27;t dismiss safety offhand. There&#x27;s a whole class of memory-safety bugs which would never surface during normal play, but could still be exploited with specially crafted packets. Of course, C++ wouldn&#x27;t give you perfect protection either.",1453106023

If I looked at some object and tried to remember details about it I would &quot;see&quot; this multidimensional spatial array of all similar objects that I had in my memory with them sorted along each dimension by some attribute of the objects, and then I could &quot;see&quot; a search take place along each dimension to find the memory that best matched the object I was looking at. When the match was found, I could feel the data load from the memory to my awareness.<p>Basically, it seemed on this trip that the part of my mind that is &quot;me&quot; had become kind of detached from the rest of my mind and could watch how the rest worked. Another example: when someone spoke, I first would hear just nonsense sound, then I&#x27;d hear a replay but this time as phonemes, then I&#x27;d hear them replay again but this time as words, then I was aware of some kind of parsing going on and them the &quot;me&quot; part would be aware of the thought the speaker was trying to convey. (And this might also trigger an attempt to remember who the speaker was, which would do that whole spatial array thing I described in the prior paragraph).<p>I have no idea if this experience was just some random thing my brain made up due to the effects of the acid, or if it really does have some connection to how memory works and/or how language is processed.<p>I didn&#x27;t try to do any experiments with memory perception while tripping after that, because I never dropped acid after that trip. I&#x27;d noticed that my last several trips had felt like context switched between the real world and the tripping world. When I&#x27;d trip, I&#x27;d kind of pick up where I left off in the tripping world the previous time. Since my last trip had turned bad, I was worried that tripping again would just pick up where I left off, and so never touched acid (or any other hallucinogen) again.",1453104958

That could change in a matter of months, which I&#x27;m looking forward to, but it still probably won&#x27;t be at C level.*  And without optimizations, rustc produces considerably worse object code than even C++.<p>* I could be pleasantly surprised, though.  In theory, for incremental builds, based on the general design planned [1], rustc should be able to do <i>better</i> even than C in a lot of cases because only changed functions need to be recompiled rather than entire files; but I&#x27;m a pessimist and expect there will be something to make it slow in practice.

Exchanging one HD in a big server might be less work than exchanging 10 HDs in small servers. Of course the HD in the big server might take down more ""applications"", but I think that is taken care of in other ways (hot swappable HDs, redundance?).<p>Overall I wonder if maybe a new OS for the cloud is called for? It seems inefficient to have seperate VMs running full OS for every tiny application. Maybe in the future not only storage will be a service (like S3), but also CPUs and RAM could be plugged together at will? Like there wouldn't be lots of small or big server instances, there would be farms of CPUs, farms of RAM, farms of storage, that could be combined at will. Maybe networking would be too much of a bottleneck, though :-/",1259614737

It's not quite what the author makes it out to be.<p>I've heard about the abuses - there are some and it's horrible - but it's not indicative of the way most people are running their businesses in Dubai.<p>A mentor of mine from England headed up a project management firm there. The workers under him made 20-40 times what they could make back home in South Asia, in places where the malnourishment/literally-starving-to-death rate is sometimes 30%.<p>An acquaintance of mine who worked in Dubai had a Chinese girlfriend who was a stewardess on Emirates Airlines. Emirates is pretty incredible in that they pay the same amounts to their staff regardless of country of origin - almost all airlines and cruiselines pay much less to people from China, the Philippines, etc, than they would to someone from France or Australia. Emirates pays everyone the same. The acquaintence's Chinese girlfriend bought one <i>house</i> every couple months back in her home province in China on her wages. Her family was becoming incredibly wealthy.<p>A company taking someone's passport and changing their contract is really horrible fraud, a horrific crime. But that's an indictment of the whole society - this kind of nonsense happens in the West too. Take South Korea and the United States - a common story is a girl gets promised high paid waitressing/hostessing job, gets sold into slavery. This is a terrible thing, and should be stopped - but does that mean that United States is running on slave labor? No. A few bad people is not an indictment of an entire society.<p>For a lot of very poor people, Dubai helped pull their families out of poverty. The did some amazing things there. Those things won't be mentioned in a piece like this. People who would be living on subsistence farming in China build houses and manage property after working in Dubai. People from Sri Lanka, India, and Eastern Europe can support their whole families and save money after working there for a couple years, in places where there is no opportunity and everyone is literally starving to death.<p>The author doesn't care about the good. The opinion piece was written before doing any research or interviews, the research and interviews were set to tell the story. There's some bad stuff there? Oh yeah, absolutely. There's bad stuff in the USA too. And England. And everywhere. There's also a hell of a lot of good that's happening there, that wasn't mentioned.",1259613937

968621,comment,967937,967937,0,0,gte910h,,,"Howdy fellow GT CS person (although I graduated many moons ago)<p>You have plenty with a capital P jobs available to you as a CS major with no love of code.<p>However, the entry level position with someone in your degree will typically be, pretty much, coding. You don't know enough about anything else to even be marginally useful. (Remember, I have the same degree you're pursuing). Depending on how much you've co-oped or interned, you may be one hair of one bit useful, but chances are you aren't even that, in anything, not even coding, but you're more likely useful in a coding position than in anything else.<p>Other jobs:\nMS Has entry level PM track positions<p>Consulting companies such as Deloite, etc (of which there are lots) have positions which are more about meetings and less about coding (but require ~80% travel).<p>There are LOTSS of technical sales jobs about. You work on commission though, for the most part, and you often have to have pretty good base knowledge of the field, for some you have to code pretty well, others not so much. Honestly, if you're still a 3rd year, and want to learn sales, I'd go start a Clear wireless dealership right now and sell sell sell (They are in Atlanta at the moment, and appear to be cheap to start. Franchises are the most likely to succeed form of small business out there).<p>Now onto jobs past the first couple years:<p>First off: I too am quite ""outgoing"" as you'd say. I run a small consulting and product development company. But I'm also a deep deep code guy. Liking talking to people does not by any means mean you're going to be one of those unwashed guys in the Old CoC smelling like BO and playing wow all the time in their time off who's height of social interaction is a LAN party or anime fest (sorry to pander to stereotypes).<p>In our field today, there is a HUGE premium for <i>translators</i>. I land so many contracts because I can explain deeply technical issues to businesspeople in the terms that they care about (risks, costs, etc) while still getting across the technology. If you can get fascinated by the technology as well as working on your communication skills, you can land similar positions.<p>Secondly: CS is still paying well, and hasn't hit a huge of a downturn as many of the other majors available to you that fit your current skill set. If you're interested in doing something entrepreneurial, then CS is by far one of the cheapest fields to do that sort of thing in. That alone should keep you looking at CS as a means to the end and make you learn how to do something deep.<p>Lastly: CS is not just programming. While I studied systems and embedded programming, there is a LOT of work in software engineering that is pretty much herding people all day long. I will caution you against spending too much time in that department, because you will strangle any entrepreneurial endeavor under too much process if you get that stuff too much in your blood (it's really better suited to mid-large sized companies).<p>Additionally, if they haven't changed it massively since I went there, GT is WAAAAAAY too in love with somewhat older, non-MS languages.<p>Try some python or some C#, or even some AS3. You may be surprised how joyfully productive those languages are for you at this point compared to some sort of matlab/C/java/scheme things you've had tossed at you so far. Hell, buy a mac mini or $999 macbook pro and release a iPhone app or two, Objective C is like the best parts of C and Smalltalk rolled into one.

Call them R1, R2, R3, <i>etc.</i><p>I also have a very large number of delegates for\na conference. Each delegate is assigned a room,\nand there are no rooms left unoccupied. Each\ndelegate keeps his or her room key with them at\nall times. We'll call them D1, D2, D3 in the\nobvious way.<p>There are many, many sub-committees that have to\nconvene.

968589,comment,968086,968086,0,0,RichKatz,,,"Regarding: the ""NO ONE"" peer reviews (as the title of the article claims) and ""creeping normalcy"" as was apparently implied.  I can think of numerous counter-examples in the software industry to what is stated about lack of review. For instance:<p>1. A company in the banking industry subjects every step of  software development process to code review, plus security code review, and Q/A testing every time they release code for production.<p>So.. Shannon Rose wasn't talking about the banking industry or business code review.  The author was talking about scientific systems.  Ok.<p>2. Let's take a bioinformatic knowledge-base company. The code used to search and extract information from the knowledge base, though proprietary, is subject to code review and Q/A testing.  In addition the knowledge base itself vigorously Q/A tested, peer reviewed and signed off before release.<p>But Shannon Rose wasn't talking about bioinformatics?  Really?  Ok....<p>3. Let's take a civil engineering company particularly, one who has been in the nuclear engineering industry (such as it has been).  Structural engineering code used in nuclear power plants is constantly verified, running known engineering cases against the code base and rigorously checking the result, footnoting and explaining every detailed difference down to the nth decimal place.<p>But Shannon Rose wasn't talking about actual critical engineering code ... But wait.  There's more.<p>The entire engineering software code base was open-source as are many scientific software projects.  Further more, it was looked at in detail by physicists, engineers, and software engineers from within the company who weren't even working on the project.   The code base was thus open to examination by engineers and scientists who use it as well as outsiders.<p>But, Shannon Rose wasn't talking about the nuclear engineering industry.  No. This article concerns a particular set of useful but not life-threatening scientific finding that the author disagrees with - and where there are people who oppose learning and understanding what the truth is and what it means. Maybe that idea violate some persons understanding of some biblical text somewhere because somehow humans happen to be responsible mucking up a whole planet.<p>So, when that biblical text was written, who did peer review on that text?  The interpretation?<p>The fact is, I can think of countless examples where people who work on scientific software, who after all believe that they are responsible for what they do, because maybe they're just that way, take extra precaution to verify their results and subject their work to review.  (Because, after all, we don't want another Three Mile Island, or Y2K).<p>How many examples do I have to cite where there are responsible people before we can reject the idea that ""no one"" does peer review of any scientific software?<p>A footnote: the author also wrote that they think the Obama administration is ""bringing martial law to the U.S."" And why is this?  Because the Bush administration was too incompetent to put heinous criminals on trial, we won't get to convict them.<p>And somehow this mistake is Obama's fault.  If McCain had won it would presumably be his fault instead. Because one president couldn't be responsible enough to begin with.  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was actually put under military tribunal and allegedly ""confessed.""  Who did peer review on the trial of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed?<p>Answer: No one.  There was a document written up.    No one signed it.<p>No. This article is not about science, or software.  It claims instead there is this general widespread failure by people who work and review in scientific software.  That claim is irresponsible on its own.   It's follow-up conclusion that this ""completely irresponsible"" software review can be regulated by so-called ""responsible"" politicians (such as those who brought us Abu Ghraib, torture, and the possible untriability of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) can ""clean up"" peer review is beyond hogwash.<p>Peer review certainly is an issue and always requires addressing. But I think this author should take their overactive bile somewhere else.\n</rant>",1259612320

It's not clear that this is the fault of scientists.  It's also <i>very</i> clear that certain political groups intentionally cultivate this misunderstanding, so that they can convince the public that an entire field of science is wrong.<p><i>""It certainly doesn't help in this regard that many scientists involved in Environmental Science are also passionate political activists.""</i><p>I have unpleasant news for you, then:  the ""skeptical"" side is composed almost exclusively of politicians and economists.<p><i>""This seems to be part of the problem. 'We'll use this data series for the 60 years that it agrees with everybody else, then throw it out for the 40 years where it doesn't, then not show anybody the 40 years we threw out'.""</i><p>That's not actually what they did, and the fact that you don't understand the nuances of the subject goes back to what I was saying about spending more time looking for ""smoking guns"" than actually understanding the science.  The tree-ring data wasn't omitted to make models fit better (that paper wasn't even about a model) -- it was omitted because it was unreliable data.<p>If you ask me, the tree-ring data should never have been included in that paper at all.  And if it weren't, as far as I can tell, it wouldn't have affected the results -- except that there would be an obvious (but largely irrelevant) gap in modern temperature data -- and the ""skeptics"" would no doubt be attacking some other absurd corner of the climate change research.",1259611406

I was glad to see this blog post, because I do think it's useful to categorize some of the reasons people want to say ""no"" to ""sql"".<p>I'd add ""level of abstraction"" to this list (ie., people say no because SQL provides the wrong level of abstraction for a problem).  You know you're getting old when when the ""high level"" languages of your youth are now viewed as ""low-level"" building blocks, but this has clearly happened in the SQL world.  I initially resisted hibernate, JPA, active record, and so forth, probably for the same reason some C/C++ programmers resisted Java's memory management - it felt strange to give up this control.  Now that I've gotten used to these tools, I'd never want to go back to hand-written SQL for basic object persistence and relational mapping, and I'm more than happy to use JPA or ActiveRecord to automate my CRUD.  In this sense, I'd say ""NoSql"" for the same reason I'd rather have garbage collection than malloc or the pointer asterisk.<p>But I do see <i>huge and fundamental</i> memory mistakes made by people who use ORM abstractions without understanding SQL (such as selecting all into an arraylist and filtering through code rather than using the where clause, or generating a list and using each element to generate a new list, rather than using a JOIN).<p>It could be that some of these folks never encounter a data set large enough or a relation complex enough to need SQL, or maybe SQL is actually not necessary to manage relations in huge, intertwined data sets, or maybe you can avoid huge, intertwined data sets through careful planning.  But for me, this is where the ""NoSQL"" thing breaks down, and I definitely haven't heard a whole lot of discussion about it.",1259611251

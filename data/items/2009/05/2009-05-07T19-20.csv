598504,comment,597918,598458,0,0,philh,,,"My (admittedly limited) understanding is that corporate personhood conflates individual, corporate and commercial speech. Attempting to treat them as separate things might work philosophically, but seems like a legal dead-end. (If you were attempting to speak from a philosophic rather than legal perspective, ignore this paragraph.)<p>I don't see why a corporation should have any less right to free speech than an individual: governments can step on the toes of a company just as easily as a person. Nor do I see why commercial speech should not be protected: I could argue that nearly everything is tied to making money. (Painting a billboard may not be explicitly commercial, but the more exposure people have to such art, the more likely they are to buy it. It's another form of advertising, even if that's not the artist's intent.)<p>Property rights trump speech rights. If you are on my property, I can tell you to shut up and go away. If I own a wall, you do not have the right to draw on it.<p>Nobody is forcing anyone to look at a public billboard. It may be hard not to - but it's also hard not to listen to people preaching on street corners. These preachers are probably just as emotionally manipulative. I wish they weren't there, but I'm glad they have the choice.<p>Edit: I don't think I was very clear. My main point is that if you draw a line between what speech should and shouldn't be protected, I think you will always end up with some speech which needs protecting but is on the wrong side of that line. It will be the kind of speech which a lot of people don't like, but I think that's the most important kind of speech to protect.",1241724740

The question is if the steep learning curve can be justified.<p>I'd say that for some it makes sense. Updated C++ will be a fairly high-level language with absolute access to bare metal and near 100% compatibility with C, that's very unique. And the world is in a desperate need for a <i>deterministic</i> (i.e. <i>optionally</i> garbage-collected) bare-metal replacement for C for systems programming. D could be it, but Walter just won't let the community to have some control of it.<p>Moreover, I suspect some of these improvements around the type system will allow C++ compilers to generate faster code than C compiler could ever achieve because programmer's intentions will be better expressed.<p>I only wish they expanded the standard library more. As far as I'm concerned, C++ doesn't really have a standard lib: STL is often awkward to use and very limited, for instance std::string is next to useless and iostream is such a pain... Then we have Boost, it comes with insane build times, incomprehensible compile error messages and multi-platform issues, so most C++ programs mostly fall back to C lib for basics like I/O, or to platform-dependent frameworks like MFC.<p>I also hope that external templates will work as promised. In the current form, templatized C++ works well only in a form of one giant file where everything is included in the correct order. Perhaps this is why every single C++ project in my relatively long C++ career has been using the language in ""C with classes"" form despite my best attempts to convince people that templates aren't always evil.",1241722910

The main difference in the groups was including drug abusers in the federal group.<p>So what? A drug either helps you or it doesn't. If it helps you, you don't care what fraction of other people it helps.<p>The value of X mainly determines how many drugs you'll need to try. If they work for 50%, you'll have to try 2 drugs on average before finding one that works. So you want to start with drugs with large values of X, but whether it's 60% or 40% isn't a huge deal.<p>Furthermore, clever doctors can often guess right and prescribe different drugs for different people. Studies that insist on giving the same drug to everyone with depression are stupid, because they're administered much more intelligently in the real world.",1241722887

I've noticed lately that listening to music with headphones helps me focus more than listening to it through speakers.  I'm assuming this is because the headphones make the music the only thing I hear, where as with speakers the music is just another thing I hear.<p><pre><code>  (...) but it has to be techno I've heard before (...)

Definitely, you want the music to set the rhythm for what you're doing but not to take center stage.  I don't listen to techno, but I find instrumental funk is great for this (Beastie Boys' ""The In Sound from Way Out"" and Forbidden Ensemble's ""Porno Soundtracks"" are my favorites, not that anyone asked).",1241722805

I was using an extreme example to demonstrate that nobody actually gives primacy to economic arguments, so their perfectly valid conclusions aren&#x27;t going to be effective when someone for example cares more about their own countrymen than foreigners. I 100% agree that some immigration would improve America economically and reduce global inequality, but I feel that I have an moral obligation to not throw poorer Americans under the bus to accomplish it. Also taking everything into account, maybe that financial benefit wasn&#x27;t worth it for other reasons. Massive illegal Mexican immigration seems to have completely fucked over many Black Americans, for instance. Economics is a useful tool to find these things out, exactly as you say. I believe that most low-skill immigration to the US is a process of enriching the richest by replacing the poorest with even poorer and transitioning the other poor to government assistance.",1427662622

While combining the two makes the number of paths greater the paths themselves are not equal (my equal cost load balancing remark). So, if the router is not taking link cost into account, which it is not, you&#x27;ll actually have worse performance over all of your connections because the router will try to balance them equally on session start.  This means that 50% of the time you start out going to your neighbors connection and fail or go slow.  It&#x27;s actually more advantageous to wait for a spot on the wide, fast link than it would be to take the alternate path.<p>If the router was taking into account link reliability and speed (overall cost) it would only give a small percentage of connections to the worse link and only if the main link was saturated from a bandwidth perspective. None of this is happening by round robin load balancing which means more of your connections are worse.  This is why routing protocols that have these features exist.",1427661858

Around a normal track, where an F1 car will get up to that speed, it will use about 1.7kg of fuel per lap, and this corresponds roughly to about 8kWh per lap, taking thermal efficiency into account.<p>Formula E cars have about 200kg of batteries (a Tesla has >500kg), and these provide about 28kWh - which would run out a little after 3 laps, or perhaps less than that if the incredibly high rate of discharge caused it to catch fire. You couldn&#x27;t feasibly add too much more battery capacity without weighing the car down too much.<p>You can get an appreciable fraction of the speed of an F1 car with a fraction of the power, and the difference is even less noticeable if you&#x27;re on a street circuit; for example around Monaco an F1 car will use only 1.2kg fuel, with a much higher drag aero package.<p>The Formula E driver lineup is a bit embarrassing, in that almost exactly half of the drivers are failed or retired F1 drivers.<p>Also, F1 drivers since the turbos returned are much lower pitched, since they rev only up to I think 12000rpm now - you might be surprised!",1427659661

That&#x27;s simply not true: they are suing for compensation, not trying to force a change in the law (they&#x27;d have to try and get the law struck down as violating some other constitutional law to do that).<p>> I&#x27;m definitely a big champion of capitalism, but these investor-state dispute settlements seems really wrongheaded<p>Why? Can you at least see the underlying motivation for them?<p>As it happens I don&#x27;t like tobacco companies at all. I&#x27;m very sympathetic to what Australia is doing and think other countries should adopt the same idea. Nonetheless, I&#x27;m OK with the idea of Australia paying compensation to Phillip Morris and other cigarette companies in this case, even though these companies are quite loathsome. The reason is the higher principle might still be worth it.<p>The rationale for ISDS is simple: politicians answer to citizens, citizens want jobs and a growing economy. Period. They want that more than anything else. In hard times &quot;the economy&quot; is <i>always</i> at the top of voters concerns. Politicians know this and will do almost anything to juice the economy e.g. quantitative easing. One of the ways to boost the economy is to increase trade, it&#x27;s classical economics and it seems to work. Hence there&#x27;s always some free trade agreements being worked on somewhere.<p>Free trade is a great idea. However in the developed world most of the easy, low hanging fruit has already been picked. Tariffs are mostly gone. The remaining bottlenecks to trade are often things like differing technical standards or different regulations, which are hard to fix.<p>One bottleneck is that business values a stable and predictable business environment nearly as much as citizens value jobs, however &quot;stable and predictable&quot; is obviously in tension with the desire politicians have to change things around at a moments notice in order to try and win votes. In particular, businesses fear sudden and arbitrary banning of their business model or sudden seizure of their assets.<p>This holds back trade: company executives say to themselves things like, &quot;our factory is in the USA and lots of our customers are in the EU so we have high shipping costs. We could set up a factory in the EU but that will take five years and be a very expensive and complex project. If we do it and after seven years the laws change such that it&#x27;s no longer economic for us to do that, we&#x27;re screwed. And we don&#x27;t trust the politicians over there not to screw with us, so maybe we&#x27;ll just stay as we are&quot;. Result: Europeans have fewer jobs so are less happy, they pay more for the imports so are less happy, the company doesn&#x27;t expand so it&#x27;s also less happy.<p>With ISDS maybe the decision looks like this instead: &quot;we <i>should</i> set up a factory in the EU, because even if the laws there change and suddenly our factory can&#x27;t operate or doesn&#x27;t make sense any more, we&#x27;ll be compensated and can use the compensation money to smoothly transition our business somewhere else ..... so let&#x27;s do it&quot;.<p>So by agreeing to compensate companies for changes in the political environment, the hope is that there will be more trade, more investment, more jobs and thus more happy wage-earning citizens.<p>Of course, politically this is a hard sell because people like to think that if their elected politicians start whacking a foreign company doing business in their country it&#x27;s because the dirty foreigners are immoral and nasty and generally deserve it .... and not, say, because their votes are easily bought by a bit of crafty populism. But then again, they really want the jobs too. So we&#x27;ll have to see how this works out.",1427659579

182283,comment,181513,181513,0,0,rickmb,,,"PHP is without a doubt the worst structured language I've ever coded in. Probably the crappiest language after VBscript.<p>But I use it for anything web-based because it gives me guaranteed results, anytime, anywhere, on whatever scale on whatever budget. I just wouldn't use it for sites with complex business logic, but let's face it, most websites, even the big ones, are hardly rocket-science in that respect.<p>What I love most is the dynamic of the PHP community. For instance, when RoR arrived on the scene, the response wasn't to dis RoR or run scared, but more like ""that's so cool, let's see if we can bring PHP to that level"". And there is more sharing of knowledge and experience (and code) going on inside the PHP-community then any other developer community I know.<p>More then any development platform I know, PHP is alive and constantly developing, but still as easy to deploy and easy to learn as ever.",1210060029

182280,story,,,23,17,lux,"Sensationalism, over the top?",,"We're sitting here eating up stories about Yahoo and Twitter, and we're ignoring stories or questions that have actual relevance to startup founders.  Why is that?  Please don't tell me YC and HN are reducing themselves to the intellectual tedium of sensationalist media, or disinterest for our core subject matter, which is the successful steps to starting startups?  We're reporting more about Yahoo than about startups these past few days... (which is abnormal compared to PG's essays or the best interests of YC).<p>We're starting a startup that will be profitable very quickly (a la David Heinemeier Hansson's Startup School speech) due to a dual subscription and content licensing model, but we've submitted a couple stories to YC/HN recently, which were almost immediately buried.  We really would appreciate help/feedback from others, and we can't see why the insight from this community wouldn't be valuable for others as well.  But my submission today didn't make the homepage or even within 160+ submissions of the home page within 2-3 seconds.  We were almost instantly reduced to worthless in the submission list, since we disappeared within seconds of submission...<p>Are we missing a step, or could the HN algorithm stand to be tweaked to improve relevance for startups as opposed to generic reddit-style stories?  If these types of stories are deliberately killed, then that leads to questions about the usefulness of the whole YC experience, since avoiding questions at such a low level really doesn't instill confidence at higher ones.  Although I've read PG's Hacker's and Painters, I'd like to see more out of the HN community if we're going to call it a communal success...",1210059320

182271,comment,181950,182002,0,0,elai,,,"I second this.  I work at a small flat fairly flat company (owner -> experienced programmers -> inexperienced programmers) and it doesn't feel like there's any politics at all.  People separate into their project teams obviously, since you talk to them more, and dealing with large clients has a lot of annoying bureaucracy on their end, but otherwise it works fine.<p>Another thing to get rid of politics is to make it that there's nothing to be political about. ""Politics is the process by which groups of people make decisions on who gets what"" or ""social relations involving authority or power"" [wikipedia]. If you have things to decide about, authority to hand out, your going to get politics! Politics is also a bit about gaming the system.  Don't have a system to game!<p>People will start getting political when they start running into frustrations (or see opportunities) where politics will benefit them or their team in some way.  Also making everyone feel like they're on the same 'team' can also help with getting rid of politics, although you have to have a small company to do that.",1210057781

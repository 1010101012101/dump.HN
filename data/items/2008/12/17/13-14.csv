By using adblock you're decreasing pageviews for certain ads, which may make some websites put <i>more</i> adverts up for those not using adblock.<p>I really don't get the 'tipping' idea. You seem to see adverts as an evil begging tool rather than an extremely useful device that connects an advertiser with an interested consumer.<p>Advertising is supposed to be useful to you. If it's not, then it's just bad advertising. But don't assume all advertising is bad.",1229522138

I mean not that one shouldn't donate, but I think economists recommend donating to causes you actually want to support. In India beggars can get their limps removed to get more donations out of pity - by giving to them, one gives them an incentive to cut off their limps???<p>That was a bit sidetracked, I guess one should also help the occasional beggar. But switching off adblock would give more sites an incentive to put up ads, which is definitely not something I would like to encourage. TipJoy to the rescue?",1229521559

When I shop for products, I usually check with price comparison sites anyway. They usually have shop ratings, too. What good could a random ""10% off"" offer do? If they are really cheaper than the competition, why wouldn't they just register with the price comparison site, so that I could find them that way? And if I go to their site through an ad, I don't have any ratings for them.<p>Ultimately I prefer to shop with Amazon anyway, because their customer service is reliable...<p>The chances that an ad pushes something into my face that I really, absolutely need but simply forgot about are rather slim, I think.

Our users don't feel uncomfortable about it (although we have had the odd user who seemed to expect that everything would be instant even though it was a web-app).

400850,comment,400658,400658,0,0,jmtame,,,"Code has become a commodity.  All you have to do is write the documentation very specifically, and some guy in India with a lower standard of living and lower wage will do it for you.  No, the code might not be optimized or highly readable (unless you specifically pay him and instruct him to build it in such a way), but the fact is that programming has become easier to do.  Yes, iPhone app development is really expensive right now because it's difficult.  Objective C is not a difficult language, but the process of building those applications forces you to think them through.  You basically have to know everything well in advance of starting a project.  It's not really what I would call a ""rapid prototyping-friendly approach.""  So in some regards, iPhone development and Flex development (or any RIA development for that matter) is now expensive.  But it won't always be.  It will continue to become easier.<p>You don't think that other countries won't adopt newer languages and continue to perform them cheaply?  If it takes 100 hours in PHP, then people will start asking for 20 hours in RoR.  And maybe now not everyone knows RoR, but those outsourced developers will pick it up if they have to.  They will pass the cost savings on as well.  And yet again, we're back into this cycle of code and applications as a commodity.<p>The only way to beat outsourcing is to be creative.  The one thing you have against anyone else who wants to do outsourcing is to take zero shortcuts.  The outsourced projects will for the most part fail, although they'll still happen.  You'll see guys from Goldman Sachs dumping some money into these lame projects that will never surface because some YC startup was willing to put in the wrench time to build a more holistic approach: not just code, but design, and usability, and culture.  That is sustainable.  An outsourced project is not (unless your Kevin Rose and promote your idea on TechTV).  By the way, I got to meet Byrne, and he's tremendous.  I would argue he's one exception to the rule that outsourced programmers are not creative.<p>The reason our engineers drop out is because they don't see how the material they're being taught is relevant or at all interesting.  There's too much science, math, and analysis when there should be more of a balance of practice, drawing, design, ethics, and art.  It sounds really Utopian, I know, but you have to ask (1) why are drop out rates for engineers >50% in the country, but <2% at schools that emphasize drawing, creativity and practice along with the engineering courses, (2) do these outsourced projects really deserve all of the hype they receive?  I would say they don't, and there's no language that will ""kill outsourcing.""  There never will be.<p>You can save money on projects, and lure the project managers to hire you instead of someone in India, sure.  But do you really want to work with those people who are just out to find a quick dollar?  And like I said, you don't think someone in India will embrace faster/cheaper languages if the market starts demanding them?<p>I hope I didn't completely miss the point on this.  Perhaps I did, but I at least thought it was worth discussing outsourcing and creativity in engineers.",1229518815

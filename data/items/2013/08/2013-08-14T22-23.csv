6214960,comment,6214358,6214544,1,0,emilisto,,,"You&#x27;re so incredibly wrong here. From my life experience, you can be one of the following: 1. a smart guy who has slept with less than 5 girls and never had a non-sexual friend who&#x27;s a girl, or 2. An ignorant, average intelligent guy who&#x27;s slept with a lot of girls but as in 1, never been friends with a girl. I see upon writing this that the common denominator in these is the lack if a girl _friend_. Because if you had one, who would talk open heartedly with you, and without the boy/girl politeness mask on, you&#x27;d see that they share a lot more than you think. They occasionally fantasize about a stranger who can give them a quick and dirty lay as well. Although not if said stranger had no idea what is happening and is gonna tell his buddies the next day about the slut he fucked over. But rather that he met this awesome person who had an great sense of humor, taste in movies, and knew how to give awesome blow jobs. That&#x27;s the kind of girls that our world, being more and more rid of caveman sexism, is fostering. I excuse myself in advance fornthe possibility that I&#x27;m putting too many words in other peoples mouths, but your attitude just makes me depressed and angry.",1376521094

6214955,comment,6212559,6213472,6,0,shubb,,,"So I smoke normal, legal cigarettes. About 10 a day, 20 when I&#x27;m stressed. I started about 20, borrowing them off friends, and it&#x27;s been maybe 8 years now.<p>The first 2 years, I didn&#x27;t realize I was addicted to them. I just smoked when I wanted, which was between every lecture and with my friends in the evening. Then I tried to stop.<p>Quitting smoking is weird because sometimes you can just stop, and don&#x27;t feel the need to smoke (until a couple months later you get drunk and buy a pack).<p>Other times, it&#x27;s really hard. As in horrible. Your brain is trying to trick you into doing it. Telling you that your girlfriend (who asked you to stop) will leave you if you don&#x27;t have one and calm down. Telling you that you haven&#x27;t seen (smoking friend) in a long time. Just like you can&#x27;t perceive your blindspot, you can&#x27;t spot your own irrationality. This, I think, is the biggest reason smokers don&#x27;t quit. It&#x27;s relatively easy to fend off cravings, but recognizing irrational, addiction driven thought is hard.<p>Anyway, so one day I&#x27;m in a medical stats class. The lecturer is making a joke about a graph. It seems to show smoking is protective against prostate cancer. Smokers are super unlikely to die of prostate cancer. It looks convincing. Smokers don&#x27;t survive to die of prostate cancer. It convinces me not to smoke again. I make my way downstairs, and grab a bagel. I have an exam next period, and I&#x27;m behind in that class. I can&#x27;t focus without a cigarette. I light up, and keep lighting up, and now it&#x27;s 5 years later, and I&#x27;m not going to die of prostate cancer.<p>There is this idea that humans are rational entities capable of making free choices, but we know they are really, really not. Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, a great (nobel prize winning) economics book explains that there are situations where humans predictably make bad choices. Addictions are one of these. If I were not hooked on cigarettes, as a smart, otherwise disciplined person, I&#x27;d be more sympathetic with this libertarians on drugs.",1376521049

6214952,comment,6211492,6213945,2,0,lutusp,,,"> There are a number of people through the ages who have greatly advanced science by providing accurate observations.<p>We need to distinguish between scientific observations and scientific theories. A scientific theory, in particular the sort that ends up defining scientific fields, must be in the form of a tested, falsifiable explanation of observations, preferably one that predicts new observations yet to be made.<p>Psychology&#x27;s problems don&#x27;t result from an absence of scientists -- there are plenty. But until those scientists start crafting falsifiable theories about their observations, psychology will remain a pseudoscience.<p>The peculiar thing is that psychologists don&#x27;t realize this. It has something to do with how they&#x27;re trained. At some point, they&#x27;re told that, with respect to the mind, looking for causes is a fool&#x27;s errand, and they assume they can create science without proposing and testing explanations for what they observe.<p>But they can&#x27;t -- science doesn&#x27;t work that way. As a result, psychology has produced any number of dried-gourd cures over the years.",1376521025

For example, it has been recently discovered that all psychological therapies are equally efficacious. Until now, the assumption was that Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy was superior to others, but that&#x27;s been disproven. But, even though all therapies produce the same outcome, no one in psychology seems willing to consider the idea that it&#x27;s all placebo effect.<p>> In fact, any explanation at this stage would be provisional and highly suspect.<p>Except the one that Occam&#x27;s razor suggests, the default assumption under these circumstances: placebo effect. Or, perhaps better, the non-explanation suggested by the null hypothesis -- nothing meaningful has been measured and no conclusions can be drawn, which I think is your point.<p>> What are we to do, ignore this phenomenon as if it didn&#x27;t exist?<p>No, but as scientists, we would do well to avoid drawing any conclusions not supported by rigorous experiment -- including the responsibility to propose and then test a theory about what&#x27;s been observed.",1376520441

It&#x27;s the densest material you can readily obtain, without the ability to smelt platinum (whose melting point issues <i>were</i> mentioned in the article as a disqualifier for functioning as money). That means that I can&#x27;t make a coin that matches both the size and the weight of a real gold coin out of anything other than gold. If you&#x27;d picked iron as the precious metal, I could fake an iron coin by mixing tin and lead together so the alloy&#x27;s density matches iron&#x27;s. But to make a fake gold coin without using gold, I need to mix something lighter than it with something heavier - and my options looking for something heavier are either in the platinum group, or are heavy radioisotopes like Uranium.

But this assumption is now under serious challenge, as more and more emphasis is being placed on a search for causes, to the degree that the director of the NIMH recently ruled that the DSM (psychology&#x27;s &quot;bible&quot;) will no longer be accepted as a source for science (it will remain as a diagnostic guide).<p>The practical meaning of this change is that researchers who apply for funding through the NIMH will need to avoid using the DSM&#x27;s symptomatic categories as a basis for research -- they instead need to express their proposals in more scientific terms, in terms of causes, not just effects. In other words, explanations, not just descriptions.",1376519877

I would imagine that most Americans were under the impression that being elected to Congress came with it the right to know a lot more about what is going on with respect to national security than they actually do. I never would have guessed that there we effectively have a praetorian class within Congress.<p>A few questions arise from this situation:<p>(1) What percentage of Congress is kept in the dark on these issues?<p>(2) Are there any other areas besides surveillance and national security over which Congress governs which is also operating with a few that know and many that are in the dark?

Typical development procedure is to write an algorithm using non-mutating APIs and get that right; then you figure out where argument copying is slowing things down (using e.g. the built-in profiler) and modify the code to avoid copying, sometimes by simply adding a ! or sometimes by pre-allocating some work array and using a mutating function on it. Compare this with a similar scenario in Matlab where there simply is no straightforward way to avoid copying if the JIT is clever enough to avoid copying you&#x27;re in luck, but often it&#x27;s not that smart and you&#x27;re forced to live with the copying or drop into C.",1376518856

This may soon become my favorite way of doing data exploration in Julia (for other things I still love my terminal-based repl).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Vega.jl"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Vega.jl</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/trifacta/vega"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/trifacta/vega</a>",1376517917

So they aren&#x27;t cutting staff because the business has gotten smaller, or because they have a gaping budget hole that needs to be plugged.<p>Guesses at possible explanations that seem more likely:<p>1. Cisco overstaffed in anticipation of larger future growth that didn&#x27;t materialize, and is now correcting for that.<p>2. Due to productivity increases and/or automation Cisco simply doesn&#x27;t need as many employees as they previously did to do the same jobs.<p>3.

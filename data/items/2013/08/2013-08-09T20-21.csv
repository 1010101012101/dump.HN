It seems like drilling in &#x27;try a few things and then google for it&#x27; (as we all do) would help a lot.<p>Certainly unwillingness to teach can be a problem, but I think often it&#x27;s born from the experience of solving the same problem for the same person many times over, and seeing their unwillingness to learn. </huge_generalization>",1376080792

How would one know what a toaster is for if they had not seen one being used?<p>Computers are layers and layers of abstractions built to deal with an important resource, information. We&#x27;ve done a good job of burying the fact that at the lowest level we are coercing an electrical charge on a microscopic wire through a p-n junction the way we want. Hardly anyone needs to understand how to create their own incredibly tiny p-n junctions, nor understand what the hell a p-n junction is.<p>However, at the larger macro levels, there is still much work to be done.<p>Something as necessary as WiFi still causes a great amount of confusion. Why not alert the user that their wifi is off? Better yet, why not just pop up the wireless selector when someone opens anything that requires a remote resource if they are not connected?<p>If we were really good at designing things from the start we wouldn&#x27;t have these problems. People don&#x27;t need to know about the file system and how it works any more than they need to know about the change in voltage inside their electronics.<p>The curious among us will always dive deeper into the layers of abstraction and ask how and why. This is not unique to just computers.<p>The modern world around us is tantalizingly complex. Things like plumbing and water have been solved and &quot;just work&quot;. The interface is very obvious and simple, and through a little bit of experimentation, one can figure out a water faucet with very little risk of failure or consequence. How we interact with water in our homes is pretty much solved. Assuming, of course, you live in a society with running water and plumbing. (Some still dont, it&#x27;s amazing how often the first world forgets this)<p>How we interact with information is in the process of being &quot;solved&quot;. Once our interface with information is &quot;solved&quot; it will be understood and there will be very little need for the major technical skills we require today to interact with this resource.<p>In the meantime, you are probably gainfully employed because of your ability to understand the current interface with information.

I&#x27;ve assembled computers, shortwave radios, robots [out of legos, soon arduinos], model R/C planes, cars, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t consider any of this _unattainable_ or even _extraordinary._ -- There are many things I hope I never have to do again, and there are many things that took me ages to do: but I&#x27;m still glad I did it, and I would _never_ put an upper bound on the number of things I _still need to obtain._<p>That is the key. I am not done, I will _never_ be done. I will go to the grave wishing I had accomplished more.<p>To say that two or three of these feats is a major achievement is laughable. _These achievements are what life is about._ Not the 8-hours I spend at my desk on a weekday, not the X-hours I spend watching television series, or reading fiction. Not the Y-dollars I spend or invest.<p>Life is about learning, creating, experiencing. Achieving two or three of the listed feats is no major achievement, it&#x27;s the mark of a boring individual who cannot claim to _truly have lived._<p>---<p>I don&#x27;t expect everyone to be an expert on every field of study -- but I cannot understand the lack of desire to know more. You commute every day, why _wouldn&#x27;t you_ want to know more about your preferred mode of transport. (How it works, how to repair it, etc.) Even if that&#x27;s _walking_, there&#x27;s plenty you can learn about exercise, biology, etc.<p>You probably get sick several times a year: why wouldn&#x27;t you want to learn about modern medicine? Hygiene? etc.<p>How can one turn on a radio and not be _amazed_ that the signal is being broadcast from 10s or 100s of miles away? (Even 1000s in the case of shortwave radio.) The same thought applies to using a cellphone, or a wireless internet connection.<p>Many of my peers grew up with dial-up -- how are you not amazed that we have speeds a hundred times faster _with no wires!?_ How can you be content with the poor broadband speeds in North America when these same people have _seen first-hand_ what happens when we increase our speeds by an order of magnitude?<p>tl;dr: I agree with you completely.",1376080259

I&#x27;ve read a couple volumes of his work, and this is a very balanced view of it: <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/mar/25/derrida-excluded-favorite/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2013/mar/25/derrida-exc...</a><p>I do think that Foucault&#x27;s theories are quite applicable and expandable, though it&#x27;s true that he can be pretty obscurantist. As the Chomsky essay notes, the history of French intellectualism that these guys come from is a very particular situation, something that even most of their non-French acolytes fail to appreciate. Most specifically, this whole generation of French theorists came of age around 1968.[1]<p>A whole lot can be deduced when you understand that France&#x27;s intelligentsia at the time were largely structuralists who believed that history moved along rationally, according to an underlying structure. <i>Post</i>-structuralism as such was an attempt to reappropriate the happenings of 1968 as a &quot;rupture&quot;, something that was new, unprecedented, unforeseen -- a real event. As Deleuze writes about it, the concept of an event is unintelligible in a structuralist sense, since a structuralist views an event as a mere surface-level phenomenon of a static underlying structure. I imagine if you went to Woodstock and told the hippies that nothing new was going on, but that their generation was the inevitable result of everything that went before them, they would similarly protest in the name of personal freedom.<p>It is unsurprising, then, that Derrida&#x27;s work is much like the brooding of an intelligent teenager. All across the world, the Teenager came into his own in the late 1960s. Any adult of reasonable humility knows that a teenager can bring to light simple truths that the adult has grown accustomed to ignoring. And that is the value of Derrida. I agree with Chomsky that much of it is banal -- but so are most bits of wisdom.[2]<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1968_events_in_France</a><p>[2] The real shame of French Theory is more about the way it contributes to the already benighted state of humanities education in a professionalized capitalist society, which rewards specialization and competition and opens the way for obscurantist occultism as the easiest way to maintain a level of job security.

If the user wants to do more, the user should learn to do more.<p>I would argue that things were not working as expected for the user but the proxy was working as intended and designed by the network admins. That mismatch is what makes using proxy or feature limited networks hard to use.<p>>  User did not understand the idea of remote content. User should be made aware of difference in remote content, possibly even later going on to use it to make smaller presentations where appropriate, or to guarantee operation in network-limited situations.<p>Having worked with video troubleshooting for a variety of people, some folks understand that the video is remote and some do not. PowerPoint definitely should be designed in a way that helps the user make the distinction better than it currently does.<p>>  User acknowledged that they were aware of virus scanners, used file-sharing programs, and voluntarily did not take prophylactic measures.<p>Relying on user behavior for this is a bad idea and brings down the security of the network. By default, always updated AV is a far better option for most people.<p>>  User has apparently never used a television with a separate cable box, or a car with a radio, or a projector with a laptop. User now knows better, and can teach others!<p>That is probably true. I&#x27;ve done TV sales and installation before and the mental model of displays and input/output is not well understood by the average person. Moreover, connecting different kinds of screens and devices can result in different behavior and may need different troubleshooting steps. That inconsistency makes it difficult for people to use those devices and displays, esp. in the context of how many all-in-one computer and display devices the average person will use.<p>>  User did not understand function of all buttons on machine. User now understands function of wireless toggle on machine, can help others.<p>The button has a use, but perhaps the hardware and/or software should more clearly communicate that the hardware is disabled.<p>>  User deliberately skips impatiently past diagnostic information sufficient to immediately ascertain source of issue and enable rectification.<p>> User will go on to one day become stranded in traffic having ignored &quot;low fuel&quot; light in car.<p>It is well understood now that user do not read dialogs. Relying on dialogs as a communication method is a poor design and shouldn&#x27;t be relied upon. Moreover, cars do suffer issues with users understanding error indicators, so I&#x27;m not really sure what you are trying to say.<p>>  User bought into frictionless ecosystem, and was not notified that the needful was already happening automatically--though pondering the question &quot;what if my phone breaks?&quot; would&#x27;ve prevented this.<p>> (To be fair, this is outright poor software design.)<p>The tethered backup/restore for iOS devices via iTunes is not frictionless. It would be frictionless is the backup/restore was automatic through the web rather than requiring a specific step of steps. You are right that this is poor software design, absolutely.<p>Also, pre-iPhone a lot of people did expect to lose their contacts, esp. for those cell phone owners that didn&#x27;t use devices with sim cards that can be moved from device to device.<p>> User never bothered to learn difference between shortcuts and files. User now knows difference, hopefully.<p>Even users that can click the correct icons may have trouble understanding the difference between files and shortcuts. To be fair, this may be one of those things that just needs to be taught in a direct fashion, because I&#x27;m not sure any software design change could really accommodate this misunderstanding (not even file system hiding OSes like Android/iOS do this right).<p>> User does not notice telltale UI mismatch, and does not know machine well enough to catch that. User hopefully now knows better.<p>The UI mismatch is not telltale to the average person. UI designs and paradigms change very often and the basic mechanics of windowed GUIs aren&#x27;t well understood by the average person outside of the most basic operations. Again, there is a reason why malware ads and spam ads use these techniques, they are seeking to take advantage of the average level of information literacy.<p>It is easy to blame users for a lot of the issues they encounter, but that is completely unproductive. If computer hardware and software cannot work well and easily for the lowest common denominator then they are not improving people&#x27;s lives, they are making them worse or putting those people in a position to have their lives made worse (virus infection, identity theft, loss of important documents/photos, etc.)",1376080039

Retrying a partially sent GET should be ok, while retrying a partially sent POST is a terrible idea. It&#x27;s nice in theory, but in practice only reverse proxies at the application endpoint really have the information necessary to make this decision, since many sites have non-idempotent GETs.<p>- Because it affects whether or not there&#x27;s a request or response body. GETs have no request body but should have a response body. POST/PUT/etc. should have both a request and response body. HEADs have neither a request nor response body. At the moment the <i>only</i> way for an intermediary to know whether a request is finished is because it understands these methods, and this is also true of any extension methods (which is why proxies should generally fail on unknown methods).<p>Mostly it comes down to an issue of routing. And in the end, the ability to have working proxies was an important factor in the popularity of the web imo.<p>But really the first issue is largely moot already and the latter could be fixed in the protocol so that presence or absence of a body could be signalled in the protocol itself (probably is in http2.0 actually).<p>All of that aside, though, http2.0 may never fully replace http1.1.

2. Found a typical &quot;code monkey&quot; job at a company where I was super-interested in the product and felt I had lots of good ideas. Work way up to some kind of tech lead position.
3. Network/established great relationships with the product team at said company. Provided constant input/ideas on the product, knowing most of it would be ignored (that&#x27;s OK).
4. When I learned an opening on the product team appeared, jumped on in with full force. By then, the right people on the product team all knew/trusted me, and it was a pretty straightforward move.

Just like the author, I do a hell of a lot for people for free.<p>I think the issue stems from the newness of IT, most IT literate people grew up in families where they were the computer whizz kid, and enjoyed showing off what they knew to their extended family, friends and neighbours.

The guy will likely get a much bigger settlement from this incident than he would from getting laid off. Regardless of whether he violated company policy, the CEO had no proof of filming, didn&#x27;t make it clear that this was a proprietary event, didn&#x27;t do a whole suite of things any halfway competent lawyer will throw at him.<p>This just makes me dislike AOL even more.",1376078550

First, why the hell would you trust that the &quot;transparency&quot; would be real? Admit what Snowden revealed, and keep the next violation of human rights under wraps. If we can&#x27;t verify transparency, it would have to be based on trust - and I see a distinct lack of both the ability to verify the NSA&#x27;s claims and reasons to trust the NSA.<p>Second, why would you trust President Obama to follow through on a promise? I believe he promised protections for whistleblowers on the campaign trail, after all.<p>And third, what good does knowing that the NSA monitors everything do, when all that really does is give them carte blanche to use the data however they want, knowing it won&#x27;t expose the program?

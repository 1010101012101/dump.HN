For most things you don&#x27;t need all the performance you can get from the machine. If clicking a button spends 100 cycles too many, who cares? Performance is something where you investigate when you have a problem and then optimize the part that is problematic. Sure, if performance out of the box is inacceptable and cannot even be optimized, the language should probably not used at all.<p>But for idiomatic code I&#x27;d find speed of execution a questionable benchmark, simply because you rarely find idiomatic code in performance-critical places. That holds for C as well as for Java.

Yes, it means you can&#x27;t write a generic red black tree in the language that doesn&#x27;t require type-casting.  However, for real software solving real problems, you don&#x27;t often actually need generics.  I work on Juju, which is a couple hundred thousand lines of code, consisting of a client and networked servers deployed across an arbitrary number of machines in the cloud.  The number of times we might have wanted to use generics in the codebase is approximately 2... and only one of those pieces of code is actually used by more than one type.<p>Sure, <i>some</i> software really benefits from generics.

So they announced that they would transfer the shipyard to the city of Eemshaven downstream the Ems river - a sensible decision you might think, however, Eemshaven is unfortunately already in the Netherlands. The state government, not wanting to lose a major employer in a rather poor area of the state, built a storm surge barrier to the tune of around 400 mio Euros, arguing it would be for flood prevention. Conveniently, it also allows blocking the outgoing tide, leaving the river at high tide for more than a couple of hours, allowing for larger ships to travel to the sea. At apparently quite an ecological cost.<p>Well, surprisingly the shipyard stayed in Lower Saxony.

Look at classical music, the visual arts, theatre (outside of big Broadway/West End musicals) - these continue to exist overwhelmingly on the basis of patronage from the state and philanthropists.<p>This is not exactly an apples-for-apples comparison (a symphonic or theatrical performance is not copiable in the same way as digital video; still less are prints of paintings substitutable for the real thing); but the underlying issue is similar: it costs more to put these things on than can be made back in gate receipts.<p>And so, when people choose to pay for films in a situation where it is just as easy to pirate (it often isn&#x27;t actually), they are being philanthropic and paying a non-market price for the film.<p>I don&#x27;t see how a $10 monthly subscription model is going to sustain the entire film industry, although maybe someone can do better maths than me on the back of their napkin.",1411554722

Before making a trip, or if you are already traveling, you can find on the map nearest store where you can connect to the local network carrier (provider) and get the local sim card. The application will be useful for those who do not want to pay for roaming, and for the provider companies. There&#x27;s currently available in Appstore second version of application, which already includes 27 countries and more than 50 providers around the whole Europe! In the future it is planned to increase the list of countries and providers, also the ability to select the best voice/data rates and plans for even greater savings.<p>Going abroad and don&#x27;t want to pay for roaming? Act like the locals - get the Local SIM app, find the nearest store to you, and get connected to local data & network provider.<p>While travelling, we often use wifi in hotel, cafe, or somewhere else, but if you want to stay connected all the time, if you need to check the bus departure time, if you need to build route, use navigator in car or make a call - you have to use 3g/LTE connection. The cheapest way- is to use local providers data plans, so the only one problem is to get know which providers are available and where you can get connected to.\nLocal SIM helps you to get all this the information you need.<p>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/local-sim/id906088582",1411554658

It had been decided that only relying on GPS was a risk, and that independent radar images would be necessary to confirm position, course, and speed.  We were transmitting live radar from Port Control over a 19.2k baud VHS data link to my laptop on the barge.  Using the radar data we re-calibrated and cross-checked the GPS positioning to make sure there was no drift, error, or distortion.  There was some interesting math going on underneath.<p>Modern radars sample at 50 MHz, giving a 3m inter-sample distance.  Getting that 50 MBytes/sec data down a 19.2k bits/sec channel was a challenge.  There were some easy gains (inter-pulse dead-time, blanking) but we still needed a radar image the pilots and captains could rely on, especially coming in from open water.<p>There&#x27;s a picture of it coming in to the river[2] and a video[3] of the vessel, having been fitted, leaving the river.  When it came in it didn&#x27;t have all the super-structure, and the highest point was the heliport, which is where I stood for much of the time.<p>An interesting job.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_production_storage_and_offloading"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_production_storage_and...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vessel_traffic_service"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vessel_traffic_service</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ship-technology.com/projects/bonga-fpso/bonga-fpso1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ship-technology.com/projects/bonga-fpso/bonga-fps...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKLXiHPNu8A"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKLXiHPNu8A</a>",1411553898

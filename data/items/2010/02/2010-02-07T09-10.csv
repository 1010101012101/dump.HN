1107508,comment,1106754,1106754,0,0,wheels,,,"Reading the description it sounds virtually identical to what I know about CouchDB:<p><pre><code>  - Distributed document database
  - Masterless replication
  - HTTP interface
  - Map-reduce-based query system
  - Written in Erlang
</code></pre>
Given that, and its relative obscurity compared to CouchDB, it seems odd that they only place where they bothered to compare the two was on the specifics of their map-reduced based query system.",1265536707
1107507,comment,1106089,1106772,0,0,henrikschroder,,,"That depends on if it's a bitmap font or not. If it is bitmap, then it's already subpixel rendered, and you would need two different bitmaps depending on orientation. If it's truetype or similar, you would need a font renderer that was capable of subpixel rendering, and it would then have to render it differently depending on orientation.<p>However, subpixel rendering works because you effectively triple the <i>horizontal</i> resolution. If you flip your screen, you now have normal horizontal resolution, but triple the vertical resolution, which is less useful for rendering fonts, and it would of course also not look the same as the horizontally subpixel-rendered font.<p>So for devices like that, it's probably best to simply not do it and get a dense enough display that you won't need it.<p>Also, does anyone know if subpixel rendering works on OLED screens?",1265536630

I count 3 fonts (excluding Firebug logo type) in too many sizes.<p>3. The 6 feature/functions (inspect, log, etc.) aren't doing much for me, and the bullets could be condensed.

1107505,comment,1105036,1105273,0,0,brg,,,"Thank you for that link, but it goes to prove the point.<p>The article mentions that in debugging time, the difference is 25:1.  In terms of hours, that is a bug getting identified in one hour versus 3 working days.  The difference is staggering.  Consider the difference in coding time from the article, 5:1.  The higher end of the curve completes in one quarter what it takes an average programmer over a year.  In terms of development lifecycle, a project will be cut due to reorganized priorities before a group of average programmers even begin to think about a beta while a group of the strongest will have been working on version 4.<p>Looking for a 1000:1, 100:1, etc is a meaningless standard.  If you meet a man twice your size, wouldn't that difference seem staggering?  But it is only 2:1.",1265536482

I'm going to suggest that the cut point is at about 50% of the applications out there today, if we can include code that can be run offline by your browser as well.  HTML5 is going to radically move that cutpoint.<p>Many of the new applications that we use in our company, Jira, Remedy, Confluence, Bamboo, are being built as web applications.<p>Microsoft Excel on Windows is still about 10x better than any spreadsheet Application out there for people who really need power, but, for 95% of the population - a lot of the web apps will serve them just fine.<p>Now - where I think we can all agree, is that the _backend_ of all of these webapps, are well and truly going to be thick server apps for the forseeable future.",1265536057

Most will not charge for the first meeting, presumably under the assumption that providing the client with useful information only increase the chance of having the client pay for future services.<p>Similarly if you come work with me for a day, and I am impressed with your abilities, you can be rather sure I will hire you. If I am not impressed by your abilities, I am almost certain that you will have learned something from the experience (either about your own skills or the tech. we work with), so for the client I would say this is win/win.",1265534292

1107479,comment,1107425,1107449,0,0,brehaut,,,"The most egregious fault of the fourth point is that it is not actually currying in anything but the colloquial sense. It is correctly called <i>partial application</i>.<p>In comparison if you were to curry the function<p><pre><code>   function foo(a, b, c) { return [a, b, c]; }
</code></pre>
you would get something approximating<p><pre><code>   function foo(a) { 
       return function (b) { 
           return function (c) { 
               return [a, b, c]; 
           }; 
       }; 
   }
</code></pre>
This new form is trivially partially applicable, eg:<p><pre><code>    foo(1); // returns a function accepting b
</code></pre>
if you wished to call it with all the arguments you would need the rather ugly<p><pre><code>    foo(1)(2)(3); // returns [1, 2, 3]
</code></pre>
The two are regularly confused. I'm not even sure you could automatically curry a function in JS because of the very flexible varargs support.<p>In contrast with this, partial application is often very useful, its easily written, and fairly common if not in the all the popular libraries.",1265534115

While, problems 1, 2, and 3 are apparently the most important poverty related problems from your point of view (perhaps because you don&#x27;t want to pay for them), it&#x27;s not clear that they are the most important problems causing poverty or homelessness in cities. For example, I have had many years of education, but I have sometimes been unemployed. Without the ability to move or retrain I would have been homeless, but not because I was completely uneducated, or unwilling to work, or unable to learn new skills. I&#x27;m sure you recognize that the labor market is dynamic and not perfectly liquid.<p>Either you unnecessarily assume that the homeless must all be un-, or under-employed because they have no education at all, or prefer to &quot;game the system&quot; rather than work, which is not evidenced, or you don&#x27;t care that most of them could be more productive in some occupation other then subsistence farming, which is not efficient.<p>Only if all poverty were cause by ignorance, stupidity, or sloth, would subsistence agriculture be the most productive conceivable use for the labor of all homeless people. This could be true of a few homeless or poor people, but certainly not all. Supposing that we care only for efficiency, and not a bit for human dignity or other peoples&#x27; happiness, wouldn&#x27;t you and I still be better off if we chose to retrain or relocate people so that their skills offered some competitive advantage, rather than remove them entirely from the economy?",1445965118

It diminishes the ability to use a study as either commercial or political propaganda (which is not to say the studies themselves aren&#x27;t commercial or political propaganda in the first place).<p>Media outlets want viewership more than anything else and the way to get and keep viewership is to tell people what they want to hear.

10459326,comment,10458361,10458361,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I don&#x27;t think it is a dire as Okuyama suggests. If you have ridden in a Tesla you can see (and feel) all of the things that Tesla is learning about being a car company (perhaps more so riding in a Roadster).<p>Both Google and Tesla have done something that was considered &quot;impossible&quot; (or at least &quot;very far in the future&quot;) by the senior leadership of the car industries, that said, just like when the first machine guns made their appearance on the battle field[1], the senior leadership did not appreciate how effective that technology would be in achieving their objectives.<p>In the case of electric cars Tesla was able to put into production an electric drivetrain with a car wrapped around it. It almost killed them and it was insanely risky. They also managed to convince the high margin market to go for it and tapped into a number of timely themes (energy independence, global warming, 21st century gadgets, Etc.) But now that they have done that, <i>all</i> the car companies have a fully electric car in their designworks. The reason I&#x27;m long on TSLA the stock is because I think the Gigafactory is the secret weapon. Someone will buy out the &quot;car&quot; business and Tesla will end up supplying <i>everyone</i> with their batteries. Like Intel capturing the margin from the CPU business, Tesla will capture the margin on the battery business. And you have to replace those batteries regularly, so its like a subscription business too. Pretty genius.<p>Google put enough computers and connectivity into a car that they could drive it. They mere embraced and extended the technology that Dr. Thrun had been developing at Stanford starting on the DARPA Grand Challenge. They added the enhancement of massive amounts of ground truth data from their mapping project and took it to the next level. But more importantly they convinced the public that self driving cars were not only possible, but <i>desirable</i>.<p>I don&#x27;t see them getting into the self driving car business themselves but they have a tasty patent portfolio to license there. And unlike companies that &quot;build to license&quot; they have enough resources to build alpha+ prototypes to further their research. So rather than wait for Ford or Toyota to partner with them (and diffuse some of the licensing revenue possibilities) they keep enhancing that portfolio. But Google car dealerships? Unlikely. I think they learned their lesson on phone handsets there.<p>Apple is an interesting dark horse. Arguably the best tech design shop on the planet they could conceivably re-invent the car around electric and self driving technology to create a consumer device that redefines the world. But they don&#x27;t have the &#x27;itunes&#x27; hook as far as I can tell. So I consider them a long shot at best.<p>[1] Yes, its lame to use war analogies in business examples but it works in this case (for me at least)",1445965059

Secondly, the article dances around ideas but never touches on the importance of the content of the homework.

There are big differences from a pedagogical standpoint between homework designed to expand knowledge, evaluate proficiency, and provide mechanical practice (just to name a few).<p>In my opinion the whole issue stems from lack of standardization in education in this country. The huge variance, even at a regional scale, in the tools available to teach coupled with the lack of standardized methods for addressing the needs of a wide variety of students presents a system that is often going to regress to the lowest common denominator (often mechanical drudgery given the ease in creation and evaluation) .",1445964607

Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1445964406

You have a house, for which you have a mortgage.  You have a car loan.  You have credit card debt.  You have a steady income, but your debt consumes 40% of your income.  Your (non-debt) living expenses consume another 55%.  (Your example of the poor person understates your case.  Poor people don&#x27;t have 20% survival margins to start with, so the impact of inflation on the poor is worse than you said.)<p>Now deflation happens.  Your non-debt expenses drop 10%, and so does your salary.  But your debt expenses don&#x27;t drop at all.  Now where are you?  Labeling your previous income as 100%, your debt still takes 40%.  Your non-debt living expenses now takes 55% * 90% = 49.5%.  Your total expenses are now 89.5%, and your income is 90%.  Your margin went from 5% to 0.5%.<p>Now, in fairness, as a middle class person, you have much more room than the poor person does to cut your expenses before you hit the edge of survival.  Never the less, this shows how bad deflation can be if you&#x27;re in debt.  (Note well, though:  The deflation has to be sustained enough to affect your income.

If I live in a city, and work, but my work only pays enough for me to be poor, you are saying I should be shipped out to the country and given a farm?<p>Under Austrian economics, how would your plan pan out? If the city removed all the poor people, who would do the work they were doing? Does Austrian economics believe that suddenly the wealthy, or rather the people who can afford to live in the city will suddenly pay increased wages to people wash dished, clean streets, do people&#x27;s laundry etc.?<p>I could see it might work if as you say, its illegal to stay in the city unless you make a certain amount, therefore making it illegal to pay less than a living wage. Is &#x27;minimum wage&#x27; covered under Austrian economics? Would it be set higher for more expensive cities? Or would the wealthy just keep the status quo by busing in people from the mandatory farms and still paying them shitty wages?<p>Also, do you think that people would be able to learn enough from public libraries to become a &#x27;producer&#x27; as you say? Not everyone is  an autodidact.<p>Lastly, what would you do about someone like me? I was homeless and jobless in Hawaii for 6 months because of bureaucratic reasons (I am a US citizen who lived abroad for all my life, and when I moved to the US I had no Social Security Number, therefore couldn&#x27;t work legally until one had been assigned to me) I have been homeless a few times, but I have never once had to claim welfare of any type.<p>Would your system have me picked up by the cops for breaking the law and shipped to 40 acres with a mule to til the earth until I have learned the error of my ways, and good work ethics?<p>Or would a system that tried to treat the root causes of poverty instead of symptoms be more effective?<p>Instead of small farms and deportation of the poor how about livable minimum wages? Instead of good libraries, how about free university education? Instead of making producers of every human being, what about addressing the people who benefit off the production of tens of thousands of people, yet give little back to the system that allows them to do this?<p>I ask this straight forwardly, as I do not know Austrian economics.

But what I think is more important is a potential pitfall involving the company&#x27;s mission. Saving money is not a core business operation, making money is. Thus the disruption of changing processes and laying people off is often not worth the opportunity cost of creating new products or refining pricing models. Using the $4 million in wages per year conjectured elsewhere, that&#x27;s rounding error compared to a percentage point improvement in returns when many billions of dollars of assets are under management [as is typical for a big insurance agency].<p>There&#x27;s also a role for queueing theory. The &#x27;slack&#x27; staffing in normal times can be redeployed in outlier events such as a natural catastrophe that spikes claims and invokes fine print policy terms. Experienced claims reviewers might be considered an in-house form of re-insurance.

If that&#x27;s the case, then it&#x27;s not a huge problem that the academic results aren&#x27;t great over time for the kids themselves if it means that overall family well-being is improved.<p>As a side note, Head Start is also interesting in that it, when it&#x27;s done using blended classrooms, it also lets kids from diverse background interact with each other before they&#x27;ve learned a lot of prejudicial behaviors.",1445962503

On the other hand starch breaks down, after a couple of steps, into just glucose. Glucose is your basic fuel that is used by the muscles, etc, directly.  Fructose has to be metabolized by the liver first, with some bad side effects if you have too much. The study that the (currently) top post links to is specifically about &quot;fructose restriction&quot;. So we&#x27;re not talking about carbohydrates in general.<p>Bananas and apples do have fructose, but it&#x27;s not &quot;added&quot; sugar.

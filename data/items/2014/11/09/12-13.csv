Grey&#x27;s [2], Crashcourse&#x27;s [3] and Henry Reich&#x27;s [4] channels.<p>I&#x27;m fascinated by this new avenue of educational material as it can provide the best parts of both books and tv if done well: You can pause and play back any parts you have difficulties to understand or want to think through more thoroughly and you have the benefit of both visual and auditive information channels in parallel. For example of the latter, take a look at this video [5] - describing the same concept (expansion of the universe does not have a center) in book would have been much more awkward. Also, the pure speed of the videos makes them more entertaining than any TV show could, because TV has to aim for the lowest common recognition speed at every time. E.g.

8579759,comment,8579495,8579730,0,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Hitler was evil.</i><p>Evil is a religious idea. Hitler was a man, not some devil.<p>Those kind of after-the-fact statements are just cargo-cult that tend to obscure real historical understanding. Even if one means it well (&quot;if we all repugned by such evil, we will avoid it&quot;) it doesn&#x27;t work that way in actual life, for it tends to stick to some people and events and ignore others.<p>One has to understand &quot;evil&quot; (historically) not just loath it, in order to avoid it. And he has to place it in it&#x27;s context and consider whether his side was just as &quot;evil&quot;.<p>Fact 1: Before there was an official war Hitler was quite beloved in the West (including the USA), both as an ally against the communists and as an example of a strong &quot;man of the state&quot; against the &quot;enemy within&quot; (leftists, unions, liberals, etc). And they did know how he got in power and what his beliefs were.<p>Fact 2: Hitler wasn&#x27;t some lone evil guy who brainwashed a nation. Similar ideas about the historical role of Germany, of the German people, etc, including anti-semitism were held by many German people even before Hitler became known, including prominent philosophers like Heidegger and Carl Smitt, artists and so on.<p>Fact 3: Anti-semitism was ripe in the US too, as was tons of other kinds of racism (not just against blacks. KKK was also against Hispanic, balkan, etc immigrants). Hitler himself wrote that he took the idea of the concentration camps from the US confinement of Native Americans ( <a href=""http://www.issuesandalibis.org/campsa.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.issuesandalibis.org/campsa.html</a> -- random reference to the first link I found, there are tons of works on those camps you can look up).<p>Fact 4: Focusing just on some historical events (the Holocaust) misses the bigger picture, of western powers holding BILLION of people as slaves in their colonies, including millions of deaths, lynchings, official executions, maimings and the like. The US didn&#x27;t have colonies at the time, but they had millions of blacks they brought to serve them.<p>Fact 5: People who consider Hitler evil (and why not!), leave the people who dropped two atomic bombs on civilian cities -- on men, women, chidren, babies, elderly etc -- scot free. They even ignore that the Japanese were already destitute and surrendering, and revert to their BS patriotically edited &quot;history&quot; to justify something which was merely a live test for the weapon and a &quot;message&quot; for the post-war times. Just an example -- one can find equally horrible acts by the English, Belgian, French, etc, including the Japanese themselves in China and Korea.",1415536658

8579756,comment,8578514,8578514,0,0,Udo,,,"In the early 2000s with a few friends together I founded and ran a web development startup in Germany. Because I had been consulting for advertising agencies since high school, building a service company for agencies seemed like the natural thing to do. Afterall, it was the kind of customers I understood well, and my cofounders were enthusiastic about the concept, too.<p>Despite doing every single conceivable thing wrong, we lasted a few years before dramatic failure ultimately hit. I learned the insidious thing about initial (modest) success is you become conditioned to underestimate the scope and probability of failure that can topple you in the future.<p>One of my cofounders, who had always hated the startup part of our endeavor, and who wanted us to become a respectable German company as soon as possible, he was the first one to bail. And in hindsight he was absolutely correct about choosing the right moment to quit. It took me a few more months of pouring my own money in and taking on debt until I realized how absolutely screwed we were.<p>Let me tell you: failing, in Germany, with your own money and in debt... it&#x27;s pretty bad. Here, culturally most of your relationships are built on a sense of success and respectability. You lose all that in an instant. Customers and business partners wouldn&#x27;t even take my call when I wanted to do a last farewell chat, even though we didn&#x27;t owe them any money or anything like that. The disappointment coming from my family and friends was just complete and total, though they tried to be nice about it. The failure of my company now meant that I as a person was also a failure.<p>After going down with the ship I went for a full time job, eventually sold a side project/company for a bit of independence, and did this for a few years, then transitioned to freelance software development.<p>I have to say after the startup - even considering the horrible parts towards the end - after the startup there is a bleakness to a &quot;normal&quot; lifestyle I could never quite shake off. Recently I&#x27;ve also gotten some very unpleasant nudges from life which made me realize time spent on things is irrevocably wasted if they&#x27;re not important to me.<p>So I&#x27;m going into the fray again.

For starters, there&#x27;s the CR-LF vs LF problem, which can screw you big time. Then there&#x27;s the problem that Cygwin handles Windows paths differently from MSYS (C:\foo becomes /cygdrive/c/foo on Cygwin, /c/foo on MSYS, but that&#x27;s just the obvious difference, filename handling is actually much more subtle). And then there&#x27;s the stuff which you won&#x27;t notice until it bites you, like for instance &#x27;.cmd&#x27; and &#x27;.bat&#x27; not being treated as executables in Cygwin.",1415535852

8579732,comment,8574184,8575049,0,0,NateDad,,,"Is there a reason you need some built-in map thing and not just user-defined functions?  If a loop is too hard to read inline, you slap it in a nicely named function and now it&#x27;s more clear and more concise.  Either way, you have to write the code to do the conversion.  select(odd) doesn&#x27;t work unless you&#x27;ve already written the code behind whatever &quot;odd&quot; is, for example.<p>I can write go code that makes this line legal:<p><pre><code>    odd_ints := parseInts(myStrings).select(odd)\n</code></pre>\nbut I&#x27;d probably write code so it looked like this:<p><pre><code>    odd_ints := odds(parseInts(myStrings))\n</code></pre>\nIs either of these harder to read? Does it matter that parseInts is a &quot;map&quot; and odds is a &quot;filter&quot;?  Their function is obvious by their names.  If anything, the words &quot;map&quot; and &quot;filter&quot; are extraneous.",1415535385

8579729,comment,8578172,8578886,0,0,simonh,,,"Quite. I seriously considered the Hackintosh route a few years ago and spent some time looking into what&#x27;s involved, but in the end decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it. One of the reasons I switched to the Mac was because I want something that just works - I was fed up with viruses and virus scanners, driver issues and such on windows. Linux wasn&#x27;t an option for similar issues though I always have it handy in a VM.<p>The problem for me is that while I think I&#x27;m perfectly capable of handling the technical issues with setting up a Hackintosh, the extra value of that customisability it&#x27;s isn&#x27;t there for me. I&#x27;d rather pay a few hundred quid more and have a solid, supported system than spend a few days of my time setting a machine up and then a few hours every few months fixing niggling issues.<p>I fully understand why people with specific needs go the Hackintosh route, for them it&#x27;s worth it. Maybe I&#x27;ll be in that camp some day, but not for now.<p>I suspect this is why Apple doesn&#x27;t bother killing Hackintoshes. If people, are wiling to spend their own time and effort doing it, they&#x27;re probably not going to instead spend the money with Apple. They are still paying a cost though, so that&#x27;s the market in action. The alternative would be Apple spending Engineering effort fighting them. Again, that&#x27;s not an efficient or economically useful way to spend that time and money.",1415535353

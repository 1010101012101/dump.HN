There&#x27;s even a timeline of these warnings at <a href=""http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1108/Imminent-Iran-nuclear-threat-A-timeline-of-warnings-since-1979/Earliest-warnings-1979-84"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/1108/Imminen...</a> :<p>> Fear of an Iranian nuclear weapon predates Iran&#x27;s 1979 Islamic revolution<p>> 1984: ... US Senator Alan Cranston claims Iran is seven years away from making a weapon.<p>> 1992: Israeli parliamentarian Benjamin Netanyahu tells his colleagues that Iran is 3 to 5 years from being able to produce a nuclear weapon – and that the threat had to be &quot;uprooted by an international front headed by the US.&quot;<p>> 1992: Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres tells French TV that Iran was set to have nuclear warheads by 1999. &quot;Iran is the greatest threat and greatest problem in the Middle East,&quot; Peres warned, &quot;because it seeks the nuclear option while holding a highly dangerous stance of extreme religious militanCY.&quot;<p>> in early 1992 a task force of the House Republican Research Committee claimed that there was a &quot;98 percent certainty that Iran already had all (or virtually all) of the components required for two or three operational nuclear weapons.&quot;<p>> 1997: The Christian Science Monitor reports that US pressure on Iran&#x27;s nuclear suppliers had &quot;forced Iran to adjust its suspected timetable for a bomb. Experts now say Iran is unlikely to acquire nuclear weapons for eight or 10 years.&quot;<p>> 1998: The same week, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld reports to Congress that Iran could build an intercontinental ballistic missile – one that could hit the US – within five years. The CIA gave a timeframe of 12 years.<p>> 2007: A month later, an unclassified National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iran is released, which controversially judges with &quot;high confidence&quot; that Iran had given up its nuclear weapons effort in fall 2003.<p>> June 2008: Then-US Ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton predicts that Israel will attack Iran before January 2009, taking advantage of a window before the next US president came to office.<p>(Bolton is the author of this op-ed piece. He was wrong then. Why should I believe he&#x27;s right now?)<p>> May 2009: US Senate Foreign Relations Committee reports states: &quot;There is no sign that Iran&#x27;s leaders have ordered up a bomb.&quot;<p>...<p>Despite decades of warnings of nuclear war within the next decade or so, the response so far has not been to bomb Iran. What&#x27;s different now that we need to bomb them, that we didn&#x27;t need to do so a decade ago?<p>I also see plenty of evidence that there are more than the two options of &quot;war with Iran&quot; and &quot;ignore Iran completely.&quot; Few say that we should sit back and do nothing at all.",1427648297

9285530,comment,9284782,9284782,0,0,zackmorris,,,"I wish there was something like Bitcoin for messaging.  Users need a better way to prove their identities (or hide them, depending on the situation) and be able to verify peers.  The current hierarchical security system is probably destined to require money, but the free alternatives make me uncomfortable because they tend to need private keys.<p>What I really want is an open version of Skype where the private key can always be generated by the user&#x27;s mind, overcomes all the limitations like NAT that make users second class netizens, has no central tracker, and (optionally, but possibly required to work around the limitations) allows a certain amount of traffic to be forwarded like Tor.<p>I don&#x27;t see how we can have a conversation about who pays for messaging when the underlying infrastructure for truly secure online communication hasn&#x27;t yet gone mainstream.  I don&#x27;t really trust Freenet or Tor and can&#x27;t quite figure out how come, so maybe we could start there and figure out why that is.<p>And a billion dollars for anything messaging-related completely blows my mind.  Most of the world-changing software was developed for a few thousand dollars by a couple of people working in their spare time.  To me, paying that much completely misses the point and probably hinders progress by locking capital up in niches that exclude developers who are working towards creating a non-scarcity based economy.",1427648215
9285529,comment,9285004,9285004,0,0,agf,,,"Trello + Google Calendar is a big improvement over my previous, ad-hoc system.<p>For years, I used:\n- Google Calendar for timed events\n- Starred Messages in Gmail for things I&#x27;d need to reference\n- Drafts in Gmail for things that needed replies\n- a flat text file for misc things / things that didn&#x27;t involve interation with others so didn&#x27;t have emails.<p>The main problem with that system is that it doesn&#x27;t really help with prioritization. Even things that have a date / time and go into my calendar, I needed some additional note about if they required preparation ahead of time. The text file would also regularly become cluttered with ideas I didn&#x27;t have time to follow up on, that had to periodically be moved to a separate file.<p>Trello supports:\n- Custom categories / prioritization levels\n- Dates & Times\n- Checklists\n- Easy movement between phone + laptop\n- A separate category for &quot;long term&quot;, un-prioritized cards.<p>It is also perfectly functional at the free level if you don&#x27;t want to pay.<p>So while I still star messages in Gmail if they&#x27;re short-term and need to be referenced frequently, and I still use a calendar for timed events (Sunrise.am now instead of the Google Calendar interface), I&#x27;ve moved everything else into Trello. It also helps that I used the same two tools at work now -- I don&#x27;t have to transition between two different sets of tools every day.",1427648214

Delete when finished).<p>- realize that if you are procrastinating it might be because part of your brain disagrees with a decision you have made.  Reflect on the decisions and uncertainties you feel, and let any objection come to the surface of your consciousness. Often the remedy is pretty quick and the procrastination disappears.<p>- escape the echo chamber.  Maybe some people in your life are reinforcing stupid decisions or criticizing good ones.

9285453,comment,9285004,9285004,0,0,barrkel,,,"I use a plain text editor of my own design. The back end is written in C#, compiles with Mono, and I have front ends written in GtkSharp and WinForms. It treats files in a directory as pages in a notebook, and it automatically tracks history of edits and autosaves every few seconds.<p>Its primary distinguishing characteristic is that it auto-saves to two files: a plain .txt file, and a .log file containing deltas. Replaying the log file reproduces the contents of the txt file. I can scroll backwards and forwards through the log in the editor, as well as through pages (files) in the directory in modification order. By default, it opens up the most recently modified page.<p>Whenever I start on a new task or bug, I create a new page (with a single keystroke) and simply start writing out a TODO list or steps of investigation. As I complete items, I delete the detailed text associated with the item (leaving only the header line, moved to a DONE section), or as I discount threads of inquiry, I delete them. If needs be, I can scroll through the deltas, retracing my logic. Works great for refreshing my memory or reloading context when I need to switch to something higher priority.<p>By convention, I use the first line in each file as a title. I have a single keystroke that brings up a search box; the search box incrementally searches through every title of every file. Files are lazily loaded when opened. I don&#x27;t browse the filesystem to open files, I open things up by title. If I need deeper search, I can grep the txt and log files in the file system; I haven&#x27;t had a big enough need to add that feature directly.<p>The directory is stored in Dropbox for synchronization, which also makes my notes accessible on my phone. It&#x27;s backed up separately.<p>Any conflict between .txt file and .log file is resolved by replaying the log, then appending the delta between .txt and result to the log. Thus if I make concurrent updates, or modify text files on my phone, they&#x27;re still available without losing history.<p>I use this editor at several levels. I have some high-level pages that track broader priorities in a category, some that act as idea dumping grounds, and lots and lots of pages that involve work specific to a task.<p>I&#x27;m not far from considering linking it to Google Calendar - creating a text convention that can be cheaply scanned for and calendar entries created, for deadlines or whatever.",1427647034

9285448,comment,9281466,9284829,0,0,graycat,,,"Part II<p>I&#x27;d been at FedEx for over a year.  I had\nbeen commuting every few weeks home to\nMaryland for a few days at a time -- not\ngood.  There had been no more about the\nstock that had been supposed to come in\n&quot;two weeks&quot;.  The company had some\nproblems, e.g., had nearly gone out of\nbusiness due to not inviting me to the\nBoard meeting.  Also the basic planning\nwas way off -- the planning said that we\ncould fly the planes around half full and\nnearly print money, but we were flying the\nplanes packed solid, had doubled the\nrates, and still were losing money --\nbummer.<p>So that I could be a good bread winner in\nmy marriage and for our kids if we could\nhave some, as we hoped, I wanted something\nvaluable no one could take away from me, a\nPh.D. for my career and/or stock.<p>So, I&#x27;d gotten accepted for an appropriate\nPh.D. at Brown (Division of Applied\nMathematics), Cornell, Princeton, and\nJohns Hopkins.<p>The oil crisis hit.  Saving money,\nespecially on jet fuel, became a biggie.\nSo, I was working on that.  I was getting\na lot of flack from others, especially my\nmanager.<p>Finally I called a meeting to explain what\nI was working on, three projects.  My\nmanager said I couldn&#x27;t do that because he\nwas busy and couldn&#x27;t come.  I told him,\nfine, then don&#x27;t come.<p>He came.  So did Fred, Roger Frock, Art\nBass, the top 15 or so people in FedEx.\nMy manager was sitting next to Fred and\nkept objecting to what I was saying until\nFred told him to cool it.<p>One of my problems was to use\ndeterministic optimal control theory to\nsay how to climb, cruise, and descend the\nplanes.<p>A second problem was to use 0-1 integer\nlinear programming set covering to develop\nschedules that would save on OpEx and\nmaybe also CapEx.<p>A third problem was how to buy fuel during\na trip from Memphis and back.  So, broadly\nthe idea was to buy extra fuel where it\nwas cheap and carry it to the next stop or\ntwo where fuel was more expensive.  We\nwere getting fuel for $0.16 a gallon in\nMemphis but paying up to $0.55 cents a\ngallon (in Nashville).  So, that&#x27;s a case\nof what has long been known as <i>fuel\ntankering</i>. But doing that interacts with\nhow to climb, cruise, and descend the\nairplane, not being late in the schedule,\nloads, weather, air traffic control, etc.\nAnd typically a lot of the cheap fuel gets\nburned off just from trying to carry it,\nand how much gets burned off has a lot to\ndo with the flight plan.  And any such\ndecision to buy extra fuel is a <i>bet</i> on\nthe future of the trip back to Memphis,\nthat is, a bet against the <i>random</i>\npackage loads, weather, air traffic, etc.<p>So, how the heck to solve that?  And, for\nvarious reasons, couldn&#x27;t get a solution\nfrom carrying a computer on the plane and,\nreally, not even from using a computer on\nthe ground after landing.  I&#x27;d found a\nway!<p>So, Fred put me under Senior VP of\nPlanning Mike Basch and, thus, made me\n<i>Director of Operations Research</i>.<p>But the fall came, and I had to decide\nactually to leave for graduate school or\nnot.  With no stock, not a lot of thanks,\nwith a lot of scars from being attacked,\nstill away from my wife, the company still\nat risk, I decided to go to graduate\nschool.  I liked FedEx, the challenges,\nthe work, etc., but making the\nstockholders rich, with me not one of the\nstockholders, while wrecking my marriage\nand passing up the chance for a Ph.D. that\nmight help my career and that no one could\ntake away from me looked not good.  If I\ncouldn&#x27;t get stock with the company still\nat risk and worked to make the company\nvaluable, then what hope would I have of\ngetting stock in the company I&#x27;d helped\nmake valuable before getting any stock?<p>I went home to Maryland.  At the last\nmoment, Fred wanted me back in Memphis.\nHe and I met with Mike Basch, and Fred\nsaid, &quot;You know, if you stay, then you are\nin line for $500,000 in Federal Express\nstock?&quot;.  Heck no; I didn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; any\nsuch thing; I had had and accepted such\npromises before, &quot;two weeks&quot;, and after 18\nmonths, saving the company twice, and with\nthree projects to do much more for the\ncompany, all there was were more such\npromises, not on paper that a lawyer could\ndo something with, no thanks -- &quot;Fool me\nonce, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame\non me.&quot;.<p>Sure, that $500,000 would be ballpark $50\nmillion to $500 million today.  And\napparently some people did get some stock.\nBut there that last day, Fred still was\njust not putting it down on paper.<p>Since then I ran all this past a lawyer\nwho concluded, &quot;Legally FedEx owes you\nnothing.  Morally they owe you\neverything.&quot;.<p>So, here on HN, maybe I definitely should\ntell this story as I have so that others\ncan benefit so that more promises of stock\ncan become ownership of stock.<p>Of course, there is a lot more to getting\nwealthy from stock in a startup than what\nI&#x27;ve outlined here.<p>Broad Lesson:  The broad lesson for people\nin startups with promises of stock, become\nvery well informed and be very careful.<p>My reaction:  Do my own startup.  Doing\nit.  Need to get back to it.  It&#x27;d be fun\nto make more money than Fred!  I have a\nshot!  Back to it!",1427646999

Some crucial funding, some\nequity, some loans on the planes, were\nbeing held up waiting for the schedule.\nThe company was at risk.<p>I wrote the software, finished my\nteaching, drove to Memphis, and rented a\nroom.<p>So, with the Board having doubts and the\ncompany at risk, one evening Roger Frock\nand I used my software to develop a\nschedule for the 33 planes and 90 cities.\nWe printed out the schedule, had copies\nmade, and handed them around.<p>Board Member General Dynamics had sent two\nrepresentatives, one an aeronautical\nengineer and one a finance guy, to\nprovide, say, <i>adult supervision</i>; those\ntwo guys went over the schedule fairly\ncarefully and announced &quot;It&#x27;s a little\ntight in a few places but it&#x27;s flyable&quot;\n(pretty good from just a little fast work\nfrom Roger and I); CEO Fred Smith&#x27;s\nreaction at the next senior staff meeting\nwas &quot;Amazing document.  Solves the most\nimportant problem facing the start of\nFederal Express.&quot;. The funding was\nenabled.  FedEx was saved.  Pretty good\nfrom typing in 6000 lines of PL/I in six\nweeks while also teaching two courses!<p>PL/I is a nice language -- good on data\ntypes, data manipulations, data\nconversions, data structures, scope of\nnames, exceptional condition handling,\nstorage management, debugging, etc.  E.g.,\nits <i>Based structures</i>, can serve as a\npoor-man&#x27;s <i>classes</i> in object oriented\nprogramming.<p>Later the Board wanted to see some revenue\nprojections.  I didn&#x27;t want to get\ninvolved, but no one had more than wishes,\nhopes, dreams, intentions, etc.  So, I\nstarted with the common high school\nquestion, what do we know?  Well, we knew\nthe present revenue or, if you will,\nnumber of packages per day.  From our\ninitial long term planning, we knew what\nrevenue we expected with 33 full airplanes\nserving 90 US cities.  So, in some at\nleast a somewhat meaningful sense the\ndesired <i>projections</i> were an\ninterpolation between those two facts we\ndid know.<p>Then the question was, how will the\ninterpolation go?  Well, why will the\nrevenue grow?  Sure:  The revenue will\ngrow as it has been so far, customers to\nbe hearing about FedEx from current happy\nFedEx customers.  E.g., maybe a customer\nto be gets a package via FedEx.  So, we&#x27;re\ntalking <i>word of mouth advertising</i> or\n<i>viral</i> growth.<p>So, the rate of growth in revenue per day\nor packages per day should be directly\nproportional to (A) the number of current\ncustomers and (B) the number of customers\nto be.  That is, the rate of growth should\nbe proportional to both (A) and (B), that\nis, to their product.<p>So, all downhill from there:  At time t,\nlet y(t) be the revenue, say, per day, at\ntime t.  Let t = 0 correspond to the\npresent.  So, we know y(0).  Let b be the\nrevenue per day with a <i>full</i> system, that\nis, 33 full airplanes and 90 US cities.\nThat is, we know both y(t) and b.<p>So, from freshman calculus, the rate of\ngrowth is the first derivative of y(t),\nthat is, d/dt y(t) = y&#x27;(t).  So, from the\nproportionality, we have that there must\nexist some constant k so that<p>y&#x27;(t) = k y(t) ( b - y(t) )<p>So, we have an initial value problem (we\nknow y(0)) for a first order, linear\nordinary differential equation.<p>Okay, how to get a solution?  Easy, just\nneed freshman calculus, not even a course\nin differential equations.  And, yes,\nthere is a closed form solution, right,\nwith some exponentials.<p>Right, the solution is the famous\n<i>logistics curve</i> sometimes seen as doing\nwell tracking, say, the growth of TV set\nownership in the early years of TV.  So,\nmy derivation, as just above, can be seen\nas an <i>axiomatic</i> derivation (maybe\nrediscovery, maybe original) of the\nlogistic curve.  The solution may remain\nan okay, first-cut approach to\nunderstanding <i>viral</i> growth.<p>So, I showed my work to Senior Vice\nPresident Mike Basch, likely the one most\nresponsible for getting the projections\nfor the Board, and he liked my work.  So,\non a Friday afternoon we picked several\ncandidate values for the constant k and\ndrew the corresponding graphs of the\nrevenue projections.  We used my HP\ncalculator, reverse Polish notation, stack\nmachine, etc. -- HP should run an ad! We\npicked a value of k that gave what seemed\nto be reasonable projections and declared\nthe problem solved.<p>The HP?  It&#x27;s still in my center desk\ndrawer.  Checking, right, it&#x27;s an HP-35.\nMy wife and I paid $400 for it.<p>The next day, a Saturday, at about noon, I\nwas in my office likely working on fleet\nscheduling and got a call from Roger Frock\nasking if I knew anything about the\nrevenue projections.  Saying I did, he\nasked if I could come over to the HQ and\nexplain.<p>So, I got into my Camaro hot rod (396 <i>big\nblock</i>, etc.), and drove over.  Yes, I\nbrought my HP-35.<p>As I arrived, at one of the old WWII\nwooden hanger buildings, people were\nstanding around and not happy.  Our two\nguys from General Dynamics were standing\nin the hall with their bags packed and not\nhappy.<p>Roger led me to a table with the graph,\npicked a point in time, and asked me to\ncalculate the value on the graph.  So,\nwith my HP-35, I punched the buttons,\nstopped, slowed down, cleared the HP-35,\nstarted again, slowly and carefully\npunched the buttons again, and got the\nvalue on the graph.  I did that for\nseveral points for the graph, and then\neveryone started to get happy.<p>It turned out that the Board meeting had\nbeen that morning; Mike Basch was\ntraveling; I&#x27;d not been invited to the\nBoard meeting; the graph had been\npresented; the two guys from General\nDynamics (GD) had asked how the graph had\nbeen calculated; and everyone else at the\nmeeting dug in trying to answer.  They\nworked for hours with no results.  Finally\nthe two guys from GD lost patience with\nFedEx, returned to their rented rooms,\npacked their bags, got plane reservations\nback to Texas, and as a last chance\nreturned, with their packed bags, to the\nFedEx HQ to see if anyone could explain\nthe projections.<p>Somehow Roger Frock had guessed that I&#x27;d\ndone the projections, called me, and got\nme to the Board meeting just in time.<p>It was close, but I&#x27;d saved FedEx a second\ntime.<p>Right:  Some people in FedEx would rather\nhave seen FedEx go under than invite me to\nthe Board meeting.  We&#x27;re talking some\nsevere cases of jealousy, bureaucratic\n<i>infighting</i>, attacking the guy down the\nhall instead of the competition outside of\nthe building, <i>goal subordination</i> as in\n<i>organizational behavior</i>, etc., right?\nBummer.<p>Right:  Apparently I was the only person\nat FedEx who still understood freshman\ncalculus.  Gads.  And I never even took\nfreshman calculus, taught it to myself\nfrom a book, and started with sophomore\ncalculus.<p>I never got any thanks for saving the\ncompany the second time.",1427646817

So no one should ever make a doubly-linked list?<p>Or, to take a case from a game I&#x27;m working on:  I&#x27;m writing a set of GUI controls for the game&#x27;s UI.  There will almost always be at least a few controls on screen, so I have a WindowManager object that lives for the entire duration of the application and does, among other things, tasks like telling all of the controls to draw themselves, determining which control has focus, etc.  The controls all have a reference to the WindowManager object (or whatever their direct parent is, once I start supporting more complex controls) so they can implement methods like onClick() { parent->removeGroupOfControls(); }<p>Even though the WindowManager is persistent, the individual controls come and go quite often.  So if I was using a GC (I happen to be doing this in C++) that simply threw up its hands whenever it encountered a cycle, none of the controls would ever get garbage collected, leading to a huge memory leak over time.<p>Is this a case where you think cycles are appropriate?  Or is there a better way to refactor this so it doesn&#x27;t use cycles?  (If someone has ideas for a better design, I would absolutely love to know.)",1427646463

The Free software movement has existed for decades and Telegram brings nothing new to the table that Google hadn&#x27;t already a decade ago (open yet crippled protocol, proprietary servers). There is nothing new here, besides the fact that Telegram basically makes no money.

It is much better than WhatsApp or Skype being a whole-pipe black box. But at the end of the day, XMPP has existed, has improved, and today provides all the features of all these other messaging transports and more, the problem is there is no money to be had in providing an easy signup XMPP service, so nobody advertises them. Which makes Telegram perplexing, because their only valuable resource is their userbase, and they are not directly monetizing it at all. Contrast that with Duckduckgo having an XMPP server @dukgo.com that basically got a blog post and hasn&#x27;t been talked about much since, that I use all the time on all my devices.<p>But fundamentally none of this absolves how stupid all these companies re-implement a wheel poorly (XMPP) because the old wheel is so well known and understood that you can&#x27;t lock people in or profit off the users using it.",1427645742

There is no step 3.<p>This was 15-20 years ago and pretty much universally available free of charge with any residential ISP here in the UK.

Know the most complicated VCS in history.<p>2. Be comfortable with CLI use.<p>3. Have Python installed, just to run a local web server for testing.<p>4.

While your container may remain vulnerable it&#x27;s the application owners responsibility (and capability) to update the application stack.  In CoreOS security issues at the host level not only don&#x27;t require manual admin intervention, but don&#x27;t even require admin knowledge that there is a security issue or how to solve it to begin with.  The CoreOS deployments do all that work for you.  It&#x27;s even reasonable for non root application maintainers to have permission to do reboots. Immediately and simply removing a HUGE workload for admins.  Plus it alleviates any concern as to how good your admins are at managing security updates.<p>In past OpenSSL security issues many servers could not be patched because of complicated application interaction.  With the CoreOS architecture these issues are mitigated on multiple levels.<p>The old way:<p>VM + Package Manager + application executables = single host system with unknown os and application security issues that are interrelated and may break when patched. Security patches must be known and correctly applied by the admin. Security breach at the application level is equal to full system compromise.<p>The CoreOS way:<p>CoreOS host/vm + Docker + container = isolated fire breaks and a pristine host.  It isn&#x27;t possible to contaminate the host, all applications and application environments are in containers.  The os can safely upgrade on reboot as soon as patches are available without regard for application deployments. Security breach at the application level is isolated to the container, and require additional exploits to escape the container. And of corse kernel level security patches are inherited by all containers.<p>You could apply the CoreOS philosophy to an Ubuntu host for example, but since you are not prohibited from running apt-get at some point on an Ubuntu host the odds of contaminating the host is very high unless you do all the homework of locking out such mistakes.<p>Add to this the CoreOS features (integrated etcd, fleet, docker, systemd, small foot print), and you have a server OS that takes full advantage of what docker enables on the host and application sides.<p>(In my opinion of course.  And just to be clear, I am not an employee of CoreOS.  I&#x27;m genuinely very excited about CoreOS, and use it exclusively as our server OS of choice.)",1427645312

What often happens is that strict reliance on grades and test scores gives an oversupply of people who are of Asian descent or Jewish and when the university&#x27;s management and alumni see that, they push for affirmative action to get the white Christian men percentages up to a high enough number that the largely white Christian men of the university&#x27;s management and alumni feel comfortable.",1427645235

The problem I&#x27;m having is exactly the question I opened with: where do you draw the line? <i>How</i> do you draw the line?<p>At what point do you say &quot;You know what, a beginner should know this&quot;? Or whatever the specific level you decide to teach at.<p>Personally I try to teach at levels above beginner. This only makes the line blurrier because there&#x27;s no clear divide between someone who kinda knows his stuff and someone who&#x27;s an expert. It&#x27;s the same problem as putting rocks in the same place. At what point does a bunch of rocks become a pile?<p>Same here, at what point does a total beginner become just a beginner? When do they become not a beginner? What turns them into someone who kinda knows what they&#x27;re doing? At what point do they become &quot;actually kinda good&quot;?<p>For instance: my mum can accomplish all her work tasks with a computer. But she has no conceptual idea of what is a file. She thinks in documents and she only knows how to open documents by going through the app she created them with. The attachments in her email are a completely different world than the ones she creates with Word directly. I once blew her mind by showing her that she can use Word to open something that was sent to her via email.<p>How would you teach her how to make a dynamic HTML5 JavaScript app? Or would you suggest some basic computer use classes first?<p>Or, for another example, my girlfriend always gets frustrated with me because I can&#x27;t just &quot;Explain How Everything in Computers Works. How Does a Source File Turn Into A Working App?&quot; in under five minutes. How do you even begin answering a question like that? Do I claim magic, or start with turing machines and work her way up to formal grammars and compilers?

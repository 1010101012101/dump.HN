6119574,comment,6118433,6118433,5,0,iuguy,,,"One possible reason for the British response in the Religious vs National Identity question is that British identity can be a very fractious thing.<p>The UK is made up of constituent kingdoms, but not all of these are on the island of Great Britain. Thus you can be technically British (i.e. of the UK) without being British (i.e. of the island of Great Britain). This most notably manifests itself amongst the Northern Irish, some of whom see themselves as Irish (ethnicity, or wanting to be of a united Irish state) or British (of the United Kingdom, but of island of Ireland).<p>To confuse things further, there&#x27;s a debate going on over whether or not Scotland should stay part of the United Kingdom or become a separate country. Scottish nationalism is a very strange creature. Thus some people may identify with being Scottish first, or solely as Scottish. This occurs to a lesser extent in Wales and in England (being Welsh and English, not Scottish, that would just be silly).<p>Additionally there are many people who are first or second generation British with foreign parents or grandparents, particularly from former colonial territories. I have friends who identify with being both British and Indian, despite being born and raised on the island of Great Britain.<p>It all makes for a big, typically British mess. Finally, my wife was born in Turkey, moved to England and became a British citizen, but she can never become English because there&#x27;s no English citizenship status.",1375077441

Some of their data suggest a relationship between sales and ads displayed in the days or weeks AFTER those sales were made. That made me wonder - is it likely that banner display networks, especially ones that use retargeting, are serving impressions to users after they&#x27;ve already made a purchasing decision, especially in the case of high-dollar purchases? I don&#x27;t have enough data to effectively answer that question, but based on the relationships I&#x27;m seeing as well as some anecdotal experience, I think there&#x27;s a strong possibility that this is the case.

In-app purchase based software can reasonably be seen to reduce the quality of an app-store for a couple reasons.<p>1) The low barrier to entry puts f2p software at an initial advantage. This hurts the market for complete software.<p>2) Competition for profits then becomes based on extracting the most money from users in hard to quantify ways, leading to insidious tricks.<p>3) Consumers become disenfranchised with the idea of an app, after they become burned a couple times, and trying to look for quality complete software, but finding that it has failed to thrive in the face of free+ alternatives.<p>Remember that old Columbia Records CD-by-mail thing? It made money because it offered a low initial cost that a kid could sign up for. Then CDs were sent monthly, and eventually a big bill would follow. Can you imagine a quality music discovery service competing with the free one that spammed kids and then left their parents to foot the bill? I suggest no. First, the up-front, honest service would require a reasoned commitment, while Columbia&#x27;s appealed directly to people&#x27;s instincts. Second, Columbia poisoned the water. No one could trust the technology of the day (catalogues and mail) to be beneficial after they were hit with a huge surprise bill from the big name in the industry.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that is a perfect analogy, but I think it reasonably fits. The difference here is that Apple is in full control of their destiny- and they can&#x27;t afford to let things go to shit.",1375076898

In the app, users have folders which contain entries that they create. When you visit the site (logged in), you are shown a list of all your folders, and clicking on one loads up a partial with all the submissions contained inside.<p>What I&#x27;d like to do is something different: When the user opens the folder, I&#x27;d like to load a partial with all the <svg> and <circle> HTML for D3, and size them based on the character count of each submission. However, I&#x27;m lost on how to do it and have been trying to get it working all day.<p>I have placed all the D3 code inside my show.html.erb file for the folder, which injects the partial into the body of the site. It doesn&#x27;t work, and my D3 code needs to know which folder has been opened to load the correct JSON data; I&#x27;m using a d3.json call to get the JSON for the folder, which contains a sub-array for submissions.<p>Is my approach wrong?

For example, lets say we find evidence that developing perfect pitch is indeed something you have to be born with, and that you have a son/daughter born with it. Would you not want a bit more musical exposure for them than usual?

So really, it would almost seem like denying this probability is the more conservative viewpoint, no?<p>Either way, this whole area is much too complicated to be simplifying it in such terms, and neuroscience is still much too young to help guide us thoroughly, but dismissing it outright seems like a mistake to me.

Absolutely ridiculous.<p>Edit: I just wanted to add that I think the two proposed solutions target in-app purchases in general, rather than just hidden or dishonest in-app purchases. A good solution would be one that doesn&#x27;t affect positive uses of in-app purchases but does combat negative uses.",1375074518

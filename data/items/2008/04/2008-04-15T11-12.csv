It seems you are also forgetting that most science was started as ""intuition"" but at some point point a rigorous approach was required to actually turn it into science.<p>From the field of mathematics, set theory comes to mind.<p>You forget that you are not teaching it to kids who are supposed to have fun with it - you are teaching it to people who will presumably use that info in a few years, and most won't have another chance to learn it again.<p>I also don't know exactly how it is taught in the US, but here (Israel) there are calculus courses which deal with with the practical side for physics students and such, and there are courses which deal with rigorous theory and proofs for match students and the like.<p>I have to add I'm taking my third calculus course this semester, and so far the second one was my favorite subject (Math major).",1208259945

One thing we do differently is we try and find the links to the real scientific papers mentioned.<p>We'd like to pay people to find a scientific paper from the corresponding press release.

While this is a large increase since 2004, this is still just a quarter of a third of the total of Corn, Wheat, Soy, and Cotton crop.  That's like 9%.<p>The article points out that this 9% is more than their rough estimate of the shortage, but that's like blaming Florida for the outcome of the entire US election or for blaming a loss on the basketball player who misses a free throw in the final seconds of a close game.  So the US magically switches off its ethanol production-- what then?  Demand increases by that same level again and this time there's no ethanol scapegoat.",1208258233

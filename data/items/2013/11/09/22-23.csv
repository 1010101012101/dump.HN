These defenses are variously successful in different jurisdictions.<p>In the UK, for example, it is very hard to defend yourself from an accusation of libel, since you have to prove that what you said was factually correct, which is of course easy if that is the case, <i>and</i> you have proof to hand.  However if a good lawyer reduces your &quot;facts&quot; to mere hearsay, and then you are in trouble.<p>In the US &quot;freedom of speech&quot; usually trumps everything else, and you rarely get into trouble for lying about another person.",1384037978

The car driver was dreaming or sleeping-  I don&#x27;t know.  The bicycle rider, an elderly person, almost went through the windshield.  Me and some others stopped to help.  Luckily he survived.<p>Story 2<p>When I grew up I was on my bicycle all the time.  I was one of the cyclists you may see disobeying traffic rules but I never did it in any dangerous way, to myself or to traffic around me.  I had zero encounters involving cars though I did have a few scary falls involving myself doing stupid stuff.  This is over years of riding every day.<p>The point I am trying to make here is that treating a bicycle like a car is stupid.  It&#x27;s almost as stupid as saying pedestrians should walk on the road, stop at stop signs, change lanes when they want to turn, and stop at traffic lights.  Bicycles sit somewhere between pedestrians and motorized traffic, they&#x27;re not one and they&#x27;re not the other.<p>These days I am very careful about where and how I ride my bicycle.  This is because I don&#x27;t have that sixth sense anymore of what&#x27;s going on around me as I don&#x27;t ride as much and I also don&#x27;t live in the same place.  New riders in a new environment should be very very careful.  I will often prefer to ride on an empty sidewalk to riding on the road as the odds of getting mowed down are much lower (but watch out for cars zooming out of driveways).  As a driver I give plenty of room to cyclists, if I can I move out of their lane, because I know that a bicycle may simply move into my path at any point and I know how hard it is for a cyclist to hold a line perfectly over a length of time.<p>Adding another thought here:  It seems car drivers these days are more isolated from what goes on around them for various reasons.  I see this even in myself as my car is better insulated and there are more distractions (GPS, phone, etc).  This is yet another problem in sharing the road.",1384037421

And because the government not just offers those services, but simply orders people to give money (or go to jail), almost nobody is able to compete with government - if a consumer wanted an alternative, he still would have to buy this service from government and then put extra money for the alternative. Needless to say, people are reluctant to do that. That&#x27;s why private schools are mostly for rich parents who can afford paying taxes and paying for a private school.

Both times I managed to walk with only scrapes and bruises.<p>What is interesting is both of those times, I was in a bike lane with rear and front lights. When the car hit me I flew over its hood and landed several feet away. I had never heard of a car/driver being held responsible for a cycling accident. You could say I am conditioned to believe that drivers are never at fault. Once, I stood up from the fall and realized I was in working condition, I was ready to leave without calling the cops. My girlfriend had been on her bike riding behind me. She called the cops.<p>The driver said it was an accident. Accidents happen... I know the risks involved with riding. The cops wrote a report stating in a heavily biased manner, how I was riding too-fast for a car to notice me. Yep, me a guy on a bike with a bright flashing light, going no more than 12 MPH was in the wrong. I wasn&#x27;t even mad. I felt great just to be alive.<p>Long story short her insurance paid for most of the damages, including a bent bike frame, ripped pants, and broken prescription glasses. But, had my lady not called the cops, I would&#x27;ve been left without a bike and without glasses.",1384036481

Think of it as meaning &quot;positive,&quot; not addition.<p>Also, Hy&#x27;s lexing appears to have an interesting feature where you don&#x27;t always need a space to delimit things, so []+1 is automagically broken up into [] and +1. Here are some other examples where it breaks things up:<p><pre><code>  => []&quot;foo&quot;3&quot;hey&quot;[&quot;wakka&quot;&quot;wakka&quot;]\n  []\n  u&#x27;foo&#x27;\n  3\n  u&#x27;hey&#x27;\n  [u&#x27;wakka&#x27;, u&#x27;wakka&#x27;]\n  \n  => (+[1][2][3])\n  [1, 2, 3]\n</code></pre>\nSo without parens, []+1 is like []; +1; in Python and prints out the same result. With parens, the first token of ([]+1) is treated as a function (as would be typical in Lisp) so it tries to execute the Python [](+1), and you get the error that [] isn&#x27;t callable.<p>So []+1 ran, but not for the obvious reasons. I&#x27;m basically poking at the REPL like you to try and puzzle this out; if you want to dig further, you could look at Hy&#x27;s docs or source or contact the folks that wrote it.<p>Edit: an additional detail, not sure if it&#x27;s informative or just confusing-- &quot;+ 1&quot; is apparently lexed by Hy as two items, not as positive 1:<p><pre><code>  => [] + 1\n  []\n  Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File &quot;<input>&quot;, line 1, in <module>\n  NameError: name &#x27;+&#x27; is not defined</code></pre>",1384036066

There&#x27;s a lot of room for improvement with Bitcoin.<p>In addition to that, Bitcoin can make some less standard payments easier, like splitting a payment between multiple users, using an arbiter for the transaction, micro payments, etc<p>> Cheaper - the credit card process costs the consumer nothing<p>Perhaps the consumer doesn&#x27;t pay for it, but there&#x27;s significant cost for the merchant that can be saved with Bitcoin.<p>edit: which could also effect the total price the merchant is asking for, giving some of the cost reduction to the consumer<p>> Safer - the credit card process has substantial fraud protections for the consumer, but bitcoin by design does not have those fraud protections, so I don&#x27;t see any way bitcoin could ever be safer.<p>Bitcoin doesn&#x27;t have fraud protections because its outside the scope of what Bitcoin is. Its like saying that the US dollar doesn&#x27;t have fraud protection. Companies can be built around Bitcoin to provide that service for a fee.<p>In addition to that, its actually much harder to steal (locally stored [1]) Bitcoin private keys than it is to steal credit cards. When an attacker breaks into a service that accepts credit cards, he can easily copy and re-use the credit card numbers because the one accepting the payment has everything needed to make more payments. With Bitcoin, the one accepting the payments can&#x27;t make more payments. An attacker has to gain access to the consumer computer that stores the private keys.<p>In other words - gaining access to a website that has 100,000 credit cards gives you a lot of power. Gaining access to a website that received 100,000 Bitcoin payments gives you nothing. You&#x27;d have to break into 100,000 individual computers.<p>[1] I&#x27;m assuming here that people either use local Bitcoin clients or m-of-n transaction where one key is stored locally. There are online wallets that stores private keys that creates significant security risks, but at least I have a choice as a Bitcoin user.",1384035965

Now most shipyards are bankrupt, and the harbor seldom sees big ships.<p>Rentals are really cheap, e.g. I&#x27;m paying Euro208 warm (including heating, water, waste, etc - excluding electricity 64Euros and internet SDSL+Cable ~ 50Euro) for two small rooms plus a big kitchen. So I can smoke at my computer, sleep in a room where I dont smoke and host guests at the kitchen. Houses are also cheap, sometimes only Euro40k.<p>Bremen is a medium size (500k inhabitants) green city with parks everywhere, and gardens around the houses. You can ride bicycle everywhere. We have a good public transport. Its long and narrow. So regardless where you live, you are in walking distance to the river, and in walking distance to the rural. It basically feels like a suburb, but with good transport, and bicycle lanes.<p>Internet is cheap and available, e.g. 30mbit cable for Euro30/month or 100mbit cable for Euro40/month. Ryan air is at our airport, so you can fly within Europe for Euro19, if you pick the right time at night for ordering a ticket.<p>Bremen is a free Hanse city and friendly to foreigners. One of our mottos are &quot;Am nettesten sind die Zugereisten&quot; (the nicest people here are from outside). Citizen here are traditional left wing, so neo-nazi&#x27;s have a very hard stand, and are seldom seen in public.<p>Bremen has a friendly police, and a sane drug policy. You can smoke marijuana at the dike, and the police will greet you while riding bicycle, and its usual that junkies are sitting in a small park behind the police station. Especially Bremen-Nord (north part of Bremen) has a very friendly small tax office, with great newbie support, and public servants who care for your business.<p>The drawbacks are high unemployment, low wages, and its nearly impossible to get a developers job outside of the military industrial complex. Also others claim that we are cold. Its hard to learn new people in a pub, but thats easier if you are from outside Germany. But we prefer to gather in clubs (e.g. we have 2 hacker spaces). We have several sport clubs, that are affordable, e.g. most working class sailing clubs costs Euro100/year for adults with own yachts. We often joke that Bremen has always good weather: In winter its warm and rainy, and in summer its raining and warm, thanks to gulf stream.",1384035944

The general rule is food has four hours outside of its proper storage environment before it must be thrown away. Eg, leave the milk on the counter for an hour, put it back in the fridge, leave it out another three hours, and now you should throw it out. I don&#x27;t have a link, but I&#x27;m citing ServSafe, a program that nationally certifies people for food safety (targeted to federal and state requirements for food service).<p>You might also consider the ambient temp of your kitchen. Pro kitchens run several hours a day, staying fairly warm the whole time (might have several ovens, tens of burners, and other hot equipment running throughout the day). Your kitchen, even with the rice cooker going, might stay fairly cool, and so bad bacteria has less time to grow.<p>Food safety is also talked about in terms of risk to different groups.

There used to be clauses in the contracts prohibiting merchants from charging an extra fee for credit card transactions. However, these clauses were recently (this year) removed by the credit card industry as a result of litigation. Also, it has always been possible to give a <i>discount</i> for <i>non</i> credit card transactions. You&#x27;re right, it doesn&#x27;t make sense, but it&#x27;s true.<p>Since merchants usually eat the credit card fees themselves instead of passing them on to the customer, they have a big incentive to encourage consumers to switch to bitcoin. It will lower the fees they pay, which probably means discounts for bitcoin users. Merchants will also like the lack of chargebacks. On the other hand, consumers like chargebacks.

Fly out to SF for some conferences and use Twitter like a maniac. It&#x27;ll pay off if your job goes south and you have to end up looking for something else. You&#x27;ll probably have to move in that case though.",1384034428

Terrorism in US falls under basic &quot;create problem and offer solution&quot; category.<p>The odds of dying in a terrorist attack would be even smaller, had we never gone to Iraq, never started Afghanistan war and did thousands other things throughout the history of US that got most of the world pissed off, starting from hard core terrorist from Afgan mountains all the way down to the WW2 veterans (american citizens) being pissed off because Gov closed national parks.<p>So why don&#x27;t you stop all those shady operations around the world and eventually, as a result, keep that 1/18th of the budget that you so desperately need to spend on &quot;keeping civilians safe&quot; in your/citizens own pockets.",1384034401

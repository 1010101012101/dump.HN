A common failure mode is when you merge from trunk to rebase a dev branch and find a conflict, your edits to resolve it are automatically ignored and not reflected back to trunk, and any overlapping edits you make later will eventually cause new conflicts when you finally go to trunk.<p>Apparently the new svn:mergeinfo property helps, but we haven't migrated at work so I don't know how well.",1262501572

1028297,comment,1027916,1028127,0,0,gaius,,,"Yes but no-one really thinks the ""war on drugs"" is a war on chemical compounds. It's shorthand for ""war against drug cartels"" which are entities as well organized and armed as many nation-states. Since the ""other side"" in the war on drugs is actually people, then all the use of language is coherent. A druglord absolutely could negotiate the terms of a surrender if it were in his (organization's) interest to do so, just as a regular Head of State could. Now let me be clear that I am not taking a ""drugs are bad"" position here. I am pointing out that the ""war on drugs"" is actually fought by men in uniform (even if that's just gang colours) shooting at each other with automatic weapons over who controls what bit of territory. If that's not a war then what is?<p>Similarly ""war on terror"". No-one thinks it's a war against an abstract emotion...",1262500668

And, one side effect of women working more is men working less.<p>For example, in this meta-survey of time allocation across many countries, average 'market hours worked' by women in the USA rose over 4 hours from 1975 to 2003 -- but the same figure for men dropped by over 8 hours.

1028282,comment,1028174,1028174,0,0,chipsy,,,"There's definitely a huge ego thing in distinguishing yourself as a ""real programmer"" or perhaps a ""software engineer,"" vs. ""a <x> who programs"" or ""a weekend hacker."" In other words, a professional vs. an amateur. I don't think it reflects at all on the quality of the work, though, just on the attitude brought to the table.<p>The professional is going to want to overengineer, more often than not, because surely, with all the vast knowledge and experience they've accumulated, tackling the business's requirements with a quick hack is beneath them when they could do a ""real"" long-term solution instead! Right?<p>Coming at it from the ""amateur"" perspective instead is going to shift the perspective towards the opposite - the underengineered ""good enough for now"" solution that may ignore fundamental architectural problems until they've blown up into huge monsters.<p>So for a startup or early-stage product, the amateur attitude is probably the more worthy one, and as the concept establishes itself into more refined forms, professionalism, process, and specialization can take hold.<p>But the skills could easily be just as good from either angle - you just have to learn to ""flip the switch"" and use the right attitude for each situation. I've spent a long time obsessing over programming practice, and it's only been recently that I've managed to make myself back off. This conveniently started to happen only as I started pushing myself 100% to build a real, user-facing product, vs. some development tool or hack.",1262499383

And given that religious donation make up for 35% of all, it is actually kind of scary.<p>Countries like France are much less religious so it makes sense that donation there (to religious institutions and in general) are lower, plus, if you take out the few US billionaires there, I wonder if the French actually give less than the Americans. Also note that French and Italians and most European countries pay much more taxes than the Americans do, and donation are not as tax deductible in Europe as in the US. You can also consider taxes to be some kind of charity, in France, minimum wage is huge and people who are unemployed get almost minimum wage like compensation + health care. So you can consider that in Europe, the state takes care of charity while in the US, it is taken care of by the people (with little success for health care).",1262499369

While it's true that the blood tests aren't very accurate, most of the problem is that doctors just don't get people tested in the first place.

That shows what you value. While you can be highly skilled at both, you will tend to focus on what you value more, and therefore practice it with greater attendance, and therefore get better at it (and you probably were better at it in the first place - which is why you value it). I think Catmull (of Pixar) is a great example of brilliance at both means and ends - but he values ends.<p>This ""real programmer"" is a professional, who will tend to be obsessed with technical skills, whether they are useful or not, because to him these skills are valuable in themselves. The ""dude"" is an entrepreneur, looks at what is needed, and how these needs can be met.<p>Here's an illustrative story: I met a surgeon who worked in Nepal for 10 years, as a missionary, religious calling. Although he tried really hard, and worked really hard, he felt he didn't make any lasting impact, and in fact, he said that ""digging ditches"" for sewage would have helped more people, by preventing diseases through better sanitation. I was excited about this deeper understanding, and asked him why he didn't do that. He said that it was because he was a surgeon, and his skills would be wasted if he didn't use them. He cared more about means (being a surgeon) than ends (actually helping people). He was a <i>professional</i>.<p>I enjoy solving problems. It's exciting, interesting and engaging. But it seems to have a kind of negative basis, like a doctor preferring sickness to health, or a priest who practices always compassion, never appreciation.<p>But in the end, it's far better to care about something - whether it's means or ends - than to care for nothing at all.",1262498600

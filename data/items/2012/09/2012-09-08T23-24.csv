I've found it to be sort of annoying as an answerer, though, and don't really hang out there looking for interesting questions to answer anymore.<p>The biggest problem is that some people treat it like a game of <i>Jeopardy</i>, except with no penalty for incorrect answers. This is especially true when the questions are dealing with weird corner cases in languages or libraries - it often looks like there is an obvious answer, but it isn't always so simple.<p>I used to take the time to get the code running on my machine (if it was simple enough), figure out what was wrong, fix it, and then take the time to try to educate the person asking, rather than simply telling them what code to paste in to fix it.<p>This takes time, and in while I was working on it, you'd have someone come in, and blurt out some guess as to why it wasn't working, then edit their answer a bunch of times and maybe eventually get it right. I don't know why, but it always bothered me to see someone who guessed around (and maybe looked at better answers in the meantime) getting credit for really sloppy work.<p>I guess I don't know how you'd fix that, and it doesn't seem to be a big enough of a problem to keep the site from being useful, but it is still kind of annoying.",1347148655

What they do buy is sway in cases where the electorate isn't paying attention (essentially establishing a default position on an issue).
In other words, the decision process for a politician goes something like:<p>1. Do voters in my district care[1]/will they notice?<p>2. What will best attract continued campaign funding?<p>3. What is best for my district?<p>4. What is best for the country?<p>[1] The key here is whether voters care enough about an issue for it to influence the representative's reelection. If not, they can move on to step two.<p>Voters <i>do</i> come first if they care enough/make enough noise (e.g., the SOPA protests).

It gets the data from Amazon in 98% of cases, adds the album art (which I like having on my player), etc. Then I store the files in:<p>Artist/Album/Track# - Song name [- Artist name]<p>The last is only there for soundtracks and other ""Various Artists"" type collections.<p>This is Good Enough [tm] for me. I can sync this across hard drives (backup), minimize duplicates (although I end up with these through compilations of various sorts), etc.<p>Unfortunately the ID3 tag system is All Wrong [tm] for this in many ways stated (in this post and elsewhere). For example:<p>- Albums don't really have an artist; songs do;<p>- Programs for automating this that get info from Amazon and elsewhere tend to use what year the particular CD was released rather than when it was <i>originally</i> released, which is far more useful and relevant (eg if you want the Beatles White album you don't care the CD was released in 1998, it should come up under 1968;<p>- Albums don't really have years either. Or at least they have publication years. The songs have years. Normal studio albums have a common year. Compilations and soundtracks do not;<p>- Genres are coarse-grained, arbitrary and (IMHO) mostly useless;<p>- What I like is greatly influenced by the circumstances around the song, sometimes more than the song itself. I might like a song because it reminds me of a particular person, place or event. Or even <i>mood</i>. Sometimes its the lyrics. Sometimes its the sound. No recommendation engine is going to capture this sort of angle.<p>This goes beyond music: people just aren't interested in classifying, well, pretty much anything. Playlists seem to be about as far as most people are willing to go. Playlists are a fairly convenient way of coming up with s event-specific music eg for working out, for relaxing, for dancing, for a party, etc.<p>Efforts at far strong and more accurate metadata, classification and organization speak more about one's festidious--even anal-retentiveness--more than any real need or better outcome (IMHO).

This could be a soundtrack, a compilation, or even that thing that happens especially often in rap where the artist is like  ""[Some dude] ft. [Some other dude]"".

Good tag metadata and foobar's search does all the work for me.<p>To me, the purpose of a filesystem is not to implement fine-grained categorization, but to provide basic grouping of related files so that I can easily operate on them all at once. To this end, my music collection mostly consists of one folder per album in a root music directory. Folders are usually named ""Artist/Group Name - Album Title"". That naming scheme doesn't always fit (albums featuring various artists, soundtracks in which I'm more likely to care about the title of the work rather than the artist that composed it, etc), but I don't try to separate soundtracks from regular albums or anything like that, I just throw them in the same root directory.  With this scheme, it's easy to delete/share/transcode an album when it's contained within a single directory, convenient for people I share with, and I don't waste any time obsessing over something that I rarely need to see.<p>Some people have advocated a more database or metadata-oriented approach where you strip all metadata from the filename and folder hierarchy and stuff all your files in one directory. It's an interesting idea, for sure, more closely resembling the way web services like Youtube store their content. It makes one begin to imagine a desktop operating system that featured a metadata database as the primary filesystem organization scheme in place of the traditional hierarchical filesystem.<p>With our currently available tools, however, having some kind of useful metadata in the filename and/or filesystem hierarchy, even if it is redundant, is incredibly useful when performing manual file manipulation, especially the aforementioned sharing of files. You'd need ubiquitous categorization metadata in files (that is, not just ID3 and company for music files) and ubiquitous support for parsing this metadata in everyday applications (that is to say, when beginning a download of a song or a document, your web browser would show you the relevant metadata and hide the filename, if it exists. when opening a file, one would have to be greeted with a search box instead of a traditional hierarchy dialog) before we could ever entirely transition from having meaningful filenames to having meaningless hashes, timestamps, or garbage as the primary identifiers of files.",1347146969

It's basically the same as Technicolor, which was invented only a few years after these photos were taken. Though Technicolor was only shot using two colors rather than three until the early '30s. But all color photography has typically worked by effectively taking three monochromatic images and then combining them into one ""full color"" image.<p>As to the purpose of your post, no I still don't get it. You're either ""describing"" what anyone who knows anything about photography already knows, or it's a criticism of these photographs as being much less an accurate representation of color reality than modern photography is. If your ""description"" is supposed to entail that, then that putative entailment seems false to me. All color photography is just a gross approximation of reality, but with the aim of the approximations not being overly noticeable to the human eye. Kind of like how MP3's are only a gross approximation of the actual sound, but for which the aim is to be psycho-acoustically accurate.<p>As to anyone asserting that the original photographer was using some space-aged technology, where did anyone ever state such a thing? All I've seen is amazement over seeing photographs from the time that preserved information such that it could be later rendered in a way that we're not used to experiencing in photographs from that time period. Don't take the joy out of life.<p>Or maybe you wish to assert that the process used here to make the contemporary rendering of these photos is little different than it would be to take the original negatives for old technicolor films from the '30s and use them to produce more modern and psycho-visually accurate color images. Or to do the same for photography from any time period and use the data contained in it to make more accurate renderings. Well, those might also be interesting projects!",1347146892

What it is, is a display of the potential power of it. It's implied that although you <i>could</i> create graphics in CSS now, you shouldn't.<p>I disagree with your take on UIs moving toward CSS too. Your parent has an excellent point about not needing to recline PSDs. Now, I'm definitely not saying we should all heavily rely on CSS for every UI element we can but I certainly think its great that we begin to use CSS for more UI elements than before like navigation bars and dropdown menus, buttons, and lots more. There's still is and believe there always will be a need for traditional graphics in UI designs for a long time to come. I think only a fool would suggest that CSS, SVG, and other technologies will replace traditional graphics but at the same time less reliance on traditional graphics is a good thing for everyone from designers to developers and even end users.<p>The trick is to be smart about their application. Some parts of css3 are supported widely enough to be viable for use as a replacement for some graphics. Traditional graphics can look quite ugly depending on your system while css3 replacements look better. The opposite is also true of CSS looking terrible and not being able to compete with traditional graphics. A good front end developer knows when to use each. Bending CSS in ways it wasn't meant to be bent or using features that have terrible support or are overly hackish/complicated is obviously something we shouldn't do ever but we are getting to a point where these new tech oldies are viable replacements. I applaud the people who create such unrealistic (in the sense that they shouldn't be used in production) demos because by pushing the limits of what something CSS can do means that some of their work will become more widely adopted and supported in browsers. It's e demos that push limits like this that get us to the point where we can reasonably start using CSS3 in place of some UI elements. The language will also evolve to make certain techniques better and easier. It was because of many of the ways we used JavaScript for interaction and design that CSS now includes features like transitions and it can only get better.<p>Finally, your comment seems to me like it's coming from a place of black or white thinking. It feels to me like you're just shy of saying ""We should not use CSS for UI elements and only graphics"". I agree with some of your sentiment but I think it's better to embrace most of the new features of CSS while still being smart about their application. A lot of designers and developers will go nuts with them and use them when they shouldn't like when the blink tag and other goodies were first introduced into HTML in the 90's. That's just what happens. But there are still many of us who know that with great power comes great responsibility and won't go around replacing every UI element that used to be a graphic just because we can.",1347146747

You shouldobviouslynot attempt to ""link"" AFX to Aphex Twin to GAK to Blue Calx to etc. etc. The artist behind all of the monikers has made a deliberate decision to release work under different names. Organize accordingly.<p>Many of your nightmare scenarios appear to be a result of the same kind of over-thinking, or invention of nonsensical requirements. How are you supposed to deal with Japanese artist names? It literally doesn't matterpick a scheme you can understand, and be consistent. How are you supposed to deal with multiple artists? List them, separated by commas, in the artist field. If they appear on an album released by a different group or person, use the ""album artist"" ID3 field. And since (if?) you use the ID3 fields to store your metadata, and presumably navigate your collection through an interface over that metadata, all of your questions regarding how to store files physically on disk are totally irrelevant, as long as you pick some scheme which doesn't generate conflicts. The default iTunes structure (Artist/Album/01 - Song Title.mp3) seems to work fine, for example.",1347145533

If you're lucky, with tons of optimization you <i>might</i> get performance to a barely-acceptable level, and that's assuming your game's running in MobileSafari instead of a Nitro-less UIWebView.

Thanks.<p>It's true that ultimately a federal court will be enforcing the subpoena, if the recipient decides not to comply. Let's set aside the structural problems that arise from these subpoenas being so easy to issue, and costing so much to defend against, which makes that an unattractive option regardless of subpoena's legitimacy. Instead let's just look at the linked ""U.S. Department of Justice Report to Congress on the Use of Administrative Subpoena Authorities by Executive Branch Agencies and Entities"":<p>> The courts are generally deferential to the agencys determination that the information sought is reasonably relevant, noting that a court must defer to the agencys appraisal of relevancy in connection with an investigative subpoena as long as it is not obviously wrong.<p>> The burden of proof imposed on a challenger to an administrative subpoena is steep, however.  A challenge based on an agencys failure to satisfy one of the four factors establishing good faith under Powell, for instance, will only be successful upon a showing of institutionalized bad faith, not mere bad faith on the part of a particular individual issuing the subpoena.<p>> While a subpoena recipient may be entitled to some opportunity for discovery and an evidentiary hearing prior to judicial enforcement of an administrative subpoena, this entitlement is not absolute and is dependent upon the recipients presentation of a certain threshold showing of facts supporting the need for such hearing. The level of this threshold showing varies among the federal courts.  Should a hearing be provided, the subpoena recipient may present a successful challenge by showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the administrative agency did not act in good faith in issuing the subpoena, was otherwise unreasonable in its subpoena request, or abused the processes of the court in seeking enforcement.<p>> As federal agencies are not currently authorized under statute to enforce administrative subpoena compliance directly, certain agencies have recognized that they are capable of taking action separate and apart from a U.S. district courts enforcement action in an indirect effort to encourage compliance. The Federal Maritime Commission, for instance, states that, in addition to requesting the Attorney Generals assistance in seeking judicial enforcement, the Commission may: (1) suspend a common carriers tariff or use of a tariff for failure to supply information, 46 App. U.S.C.  1712(b)(2), (2) impose a penalty of up to $50,000 per shipment for carriers subsequently operating under a suspended tariff, 46 App. U.S.C. 1712(b)(3), and (3) request that the Secretary of the Treasury refuse clearance to carriers in noncompliance with a subpoena request,<p>If you don't see this as a situation that's ripe for abuse, we just have very different perspectives on human nature and there's not much arguing that's going to bridge the gap.",1347145323

It has a separate tagging component called ""ex falso"" which you can run standalone and then use the player of your choice.<p>But I would strongly recommend Quodlibet for its organizational capabilities as well.

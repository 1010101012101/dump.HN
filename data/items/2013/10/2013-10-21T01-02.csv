While the general goals are certainly technically achievable, there are 44,000 pages of regulations generated from the affordable care act, in addition to the over 1,000 pages in the law itself. Just to dig through that and pull out everything related to insurance policy offering is going to take some serious time.  In addition, each state has unique health care laws and regulations regarding the offer of insurance in that state.<p>However, the biggest problem I have heard of is simply stupid requirements from the government. Rather than have an open market where an individual insurance customer or any curious person could look at all of the products and prices, they make you verify your identity first. Why would they do this? They were afraid that people would get sticker shock from looking at insurance prices that didn&#x27;t include the money they would be getting from taxpayers to defray the cost. This lack of trust in us has caused a lack of trust in their system.<p>It would seem that one thing that independent developers that want to help out could do would be to extract all of the useful data from the site.

Then, once people were able to do that, they could then go through the arduous identity verification process to qualify for a subsidy and get one of the plans.

My point was that for many authors, particularly authors on the high end of the fiction market, appearance <i>does</i> matter to them.  These people love books, not just the words but the physical feel and appearance.  They have opinions about the physical form their book takes.  Are they wrong?<p>I&#x27;ve helped a few authors get set up with their own websites, and the same concerns translated.  They cared very much about how the site appeared, and had intelligent opinions about why that was the case.  They weren&#x27;t web ingenues -- they&#x27;d been reading other author blogs for years.  Why would their concern with the appearance of the written word change when that word was online?<p>I can&#x27;t name names, but these authors were far from self-publishing.  They had substantial contracts from major houses.  Their books were all covered in the NYTRB.  The publisher of course paid for <i>one</i> lay-out of the book, but it was not customary to cover three.  That&#x27;s why the author used his personal funds -- for the extra two lay-outs.",1382319904

They&#x27;ve recently partnered with Media.net for their content (display network ads) and many of the publishers in that network deliver fraudulent clicks (Keywordblocks and the like).<p>The other problem I&#x27;ve noticed is that if you don&#x27;t bid high enough for search keywords, they start sending you traffic from Media.net and make it look like it is search traffic. For example I bid on the search term &quot;get money now&quot; (don&#x27;t want to reveal the actual query). For real search traffic, the clicks convert very well for me. A few months ago I noticed that my conversion rates had fallen significantly. When I investigated I noticed that most of it was from media.net/5_ways_to_get_money.cfm and none of these clicks ever produced a sale. I am in the process of pursuing a refund and have blocked the site. Real search traffic always comes from search.yahoo.com or Bing.com.<p>It is an even bigger problem for AOL (Advertising.com) that includes supposedly premium sites like HuffingtonPost.com. You will frequently notice:<p>1. Inflated clicks. Your analytics show you got 100 clicks, their&#x27;s show you got 170. When you raise this with their support staff the standard answer is they will not investigate based on someone else&#x27;s analytics. I said, I have two different analytics programs on my server that show the same count which is a lot lower than theirs. They  still won&#x27;t budge.

To the degree that rent will be a major expense in the early years, when your valuation is at its lowest, your landlord could end up owning a non-trivial portion of your company. He/she/it is going to have a vote on every significant ownership even in your company&#x27;s life cycle -- Series A, B, C financing, sale of the company, etc. Also think about what will happen if the landlord comes to you in a few years and wants to sell these shares. You&#x27;re then going to be stuck re-purchasing them out of operating funds, or risking a sale of equity to an unknown third party.<p>The whole point of venture capital is that VC&#x27;s are willing and able to translate equity in your start-up into cash, which you can then use to pay for things like rent and legal bills.

Then he could put them in a database, get his &#x27;SQL for Dummies&#x27; book out and select just the phone records that are common to all incidents.<p>He can then go back to the phone companies and get the billing details for Banksy and his entourage. He could also ask them to let him know exactly where they are, follow them and catch them red handed doing their next piece.<p>Personally I see Banksy as a cartoonist rather than as a graffiti artist. He does not have a formal arrangement with the papers to syndicate his work, he does not even have to churn something out every day. Instead he gets his work prominently shown in all of the British papers, reaching an audience that no other cartoonist can. He has Robin Hood grade street cred. due to this audience reach.<p>Whereas other cartoonists use pen and paper, Banksy uses the side of some house or another wall as the medium. It is an intermediate form much like the conventional cartoonist&#x27;s paper is. Although of value to the crazies that go mad for such things it is of no value to Banksy if his aim is to get his work into the paper, to reach a mass audience.<p>As for the people who have inherited the work, they could just let the boring &#x27;tag&#x27; graffiti artists vandalise the Banksy masterpiece as quickly as possible, whilst there is still the media interest. It will then be known that it has been destroyed and the troublesome visitors will cease to turn up. They can then paint it over, to restore their property back to normal and get on with life.<p>Getting back to the mayor, if the trick works for catching Banksy then it will probably work for all of the inane tagging losers out there. So long as citizens report new tag-vandalisms in a timely fashion then the police should be able to get a reasonable sized list of phone numbers to work with.<p>I have known and known of &#x27;tag&#x27; graffiti artists in my time. I still don&#x27;t see why they are so determined to do what they do and for so late into adult life. I feel sorry for them not having any meaning to their &#x27;art&#x27;. The strangest thing to me are the &#x27;tags&#x27; put up in some foreign town. Imagine going to another country, a place you do not live, just to paint your tag up on some walls that you are not going to see again.<p>With a Banksy it cannot be said to truly exist until the papers report the new birth. With small time tedious tagging types they get Facebook instead of the media to show off their efforts. Invariably those that tag post their tags online somewhere. The phones can lead the authorities to where this is and get the evidence needed for prosecution.",1382319129

A browser only needs a few megabytes of buffer to display 1080p content properly.
Everyday example: user starts watching a youtube video, gets interrupted and pauses it, then closes the browser because they got carried away. The entire video will be downloaded and put in the cache where only a few megabytes were needed/watched. That&#x27;s quite a waste of bandwidth at 1080p.<p>Multiplexing allows you to have the same level of concurrency as you currently have with domain sharding without requiring multiple TCP connections (and TLS contexts).
Starting and getting a TCP connection up to speed takes a while, especially on congested links (packet loss, spurious retransmits, slow starts, etc.), and TLS just makes the problem worse by requiring multiple back and forth to setup encryption.
It also takes quite a bit of memory on servers to maintain hundreds of thousands of TCP socket and TLS states, and a lot of CPU to set up TLS contexts (Diffie Hellman can be quite expensive CPU wise).
Then, there are flow-based routers, load balancers, stateful firewalls and other stateful network equipments. We&#x27;ll get greater performance out of them by using less concurrent connections.<p>I think moving to a binary protocol and reducing the number of TCP/TLS connections is a very good thing, long overdue IMHO.<p>EDIT: typos :)",1382318992

My guess would be that the typeface on your site is so small (you&#x27;re running that one now still?) that the lighter font might have made it harder to read. It would be interesting to see if these single-variable changes actually keep you in a local maximum. For example, imagine that:<p>- pure black fonts are actually bad for conversion, and conversion gets worse the more pure black that is exposed (ie. the size of the type).<p>- small font sizes are also bad for conversion.<p>- long line lengths are also bad for conversion.<p>- tall paragraphs (in number of lines) are also bad for conversion.<p>Now I&#x27;d imagine (purely on design instincts) that the best possible reading experience (which I&#x27;m assuming also means more reading time) would be to have off-black-colored type, at a size around 16px, with a line length of 70-80 characters, and an average paragraph height of around 4-5.<p>Couldn&#x27;t it be that changing all four variables at once will make for a big boost in conversion, but changing one at a time runs into the limitations of the others?

Everything in between just works.&quot;<p>This was not true up through 3.2, because Unicode in Python <= 3.2 was an abstraction that leaked some very unfortunate implementation details. There was the chance that you were on a &quot;narrow build&quot; of Python, where Unicode characters in memory were fixed to be two bytes long, so you couldn&#x27;t perform most operations on characters outside the Basic Multilingual Plane.

Dark values appear much darker next to a very light value (true everywhere). For example, you can make a dark gray look black by surrounding it with bright white.

(They are very purposefully brighter than your surroundings so that you can still read them even if the room you are in is bright.) That means that when you put a bright white next to a dark black on the screen you&#x27;re going to get a much higher contrast ratio than the same values in print. Yes, technically you could achieve the same values in print if you wanted to, but the fact is people interact with those higher ratios much less frequently.<p>So, yes, if you really want, you can make this your conclusion:<p>> Use black if you want to - it won&#x27;t be pure black, it will simply be the darkest you can get.<p>But that&#x27;s a pretty useless conclusion for anyone who wants to learn about what&#x27;s going on.

We may presume, from the fact that this behavior persists throughout human history, that these agencies see some concrete benefit in so doing; while of course one may find individuals and institutions acting against their own interests, such behavior cannot lend itself to survival across centuries.<p>Were all humans angels, would those who constitute these doleful organizations see such benefit? I find it doubtful; while &quot;angel&quot; is not properly formulated here or anywhere else, we can assume from context that the cardinal quality of such a creature would be a perfect altruism, one to which gain of self at expense of another would be not merely distasteful but insuperably repellent, if indeed conceivable at all.<p>The necessary conclusion, then, is that, while there may be <i>some</i> humans who are actually angels, <i>all</i> humans cannot possibly be angels, because no true angel would act in behalf of a scheme centered upon convincing other angels they were in fact not angels, to the real and significant benefit of the schemers.<p>We therefore find ourselves with the following dilemma: either not all humans are angels, and to have stable and effective government, we must find some way to rule which accounts for this fact; or, not all things which have the human semblance are human, and to have stable and effective government, we must identify and exterminate the unhuman creatures which beset us, down to the last not-man, not-woman, and not-child, in order that we true humans may govern ourselves, free of their blight, in whatever fashion our shared perfect altruism sees fit.<p>Perhaps you feel I have unfairly caricatured one of these points of view.

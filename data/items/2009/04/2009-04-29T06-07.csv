I was quite surprised that none appeared to look offended, disgusted, etc., and that none got up and left in the middle.<p>I kept thinking, sheesh I would guess that anyone who knows Matt probably finds this funny and harmless... but at the same time it struck me as a few steps over the line... especially since his point could have been made with far more subtlety.<p>I think _why's comment says it all:  Be sure to make it look like when you zoom out it's just two bagels.<p>The whole apology thing is great, but I think the ideal response would have been ""Ok, I see that putting hard core porn in the middle of a slide show is likely to offend some people""...  To me that is quite obvious.<p>edit:  I should note that I'm not the least bit offended by most porn, but think it's best experienced either alone or in the company of people who have opted in.",1240986776

That's what Wikipedia does, it writes and improves encyclopedia articles by crowdsourcing. Saying it's an abuse because the article is bad is ridiculous. That's the whole point -- to fix the article.

So create a user object in the database for them and keep track of the last access date. You can either mark the account as temporary, or just store an empty password and rely on that to identify accounts that are not fully registered. You can purge inactive accounts after a certain number of days. If it's only keyed by session ID then there's no point to keep this data around past the session expiration date.<p>Then in a few places in your app you can check if you have the necessary information on file for the current user acocunt, and prompt the user to enter it if not (things like email address, a picture, real name, whatever it is you need).

Not sure if this is just a time thing (seems to take 24-48 hours to filter out from the US to other stores)<p>From the screenshots on your website, the title text is clipped on the top and left of the 'N', on the right of the last 'a', and along most of the bottom.<p>For iPhone apps, look counts for a huge amount. If you can take the bronzy sort of look you've given the title and apply that as a theme across the whole game I think it would make a huge difference towards how people perceive it. At the moment it screams ""I'm new to this and this is my first app"". If you could whip up some custom tile backgrounds etc it would change the look (and hence people's impressions) in a big way.<p>I'm not sure there's much benefit on you doing a Lite version for this. How will you differentiate between the Lite and Full versions? Still, it's probably worth a shot and see if it makes any difference to sales (get figures for the full version for a few weeks, then release the Lite version and see how much it affects things)<p>Good luck :)",1240985503

I never heard of traders being categorized as ""derivatives traders"" and ""non-derivatives traders"". There are tons of derivatives contracts out there, and no one knows how to trade all of them proficiently. What I have heard is traders being categorized as ""equity derivatives traders"", ""fixed-income traders"", ""commodities traders"", etc. I once worked at a hedge fund for an equity futures trader. He loved to bash bankers more than anything else... but he also bashed other traders, especially FX and metals traders, who he considered sub-human morons...<p>Last but not least, I have never heard of an English major trading derivatives.

584668,comment,583968,583968,0,0,landist,,,"Couple of thoughts:<p>1. Maybe a bit fluffy, but since most mainstream readers don't know about Y Combinator, the first cycle of articles are going to trend positive.<p>2. I think the Y Combinator ecosystem (the program, demo days, Hacker News) itself is going to prove as disruptive (if not more) as the companies they fund. A disruptive ""Ivy League of Startup Schools"" is starting to form that I believe will have huge ripple effects on our economy.<p>3. I agree, mainstream media doesn't understand how much hackers are our era's Robber Barons (or Industrial Statesmen, take your pick). Expect a handful of IPO's and at least one billionaire graduate within the next ten years. I expect Y Combinator graduates and their related companies will have billions of dollars of impact on our economy over this period of time.<p>4. The traditional University model of education is probably as much at risk by ignoring YC as is big Fortune 500 companies. ""The average debt for graduating college seniors who borrow to finance their undergraduate degree is just under $20,000."" vs. the avg. YC funded company probably gets funded to the order of $15k - $20k.<p>""In 2003, workers with bachelor's degrees earned a median of $49,900. Those who'd completed several years of college with no degree had median earnings of $35,700, while those with a high school diploma averaged $30,800.""<p>Don't get me wrong, I understand that not every high school graduate can attend YC or some similar program. But I think our educational system needs to create some alternative tracks for education that are shorter in time frame, more entrepreneurial in nature, and more technically inclined. If we simply diverted 1% of college freshman into such programs, this would translated into over 20,000 individuals. Can you imagine the impact on society of 20k freshman attending some Y Combinator-esque hacker / entrepreneurial program every year?<p><a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/17/pf/college/college_costs/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/17/pf/college/college_costs/ind...</a>",1240985271

Eg if you are discussing groups, you need to memorize maybe 10 examples of groups -- trivial, nice groups, some finite symmetric groups, some infinite groups, an asymmetric group or two, and one or two weird examples.  Then whenever you listen or read a theorem, think about what that means for your examples, starting with nice cases like R^n and proceeding to ugly cases.<p>Thanks Prof Ram.  I didn't really appreciate memorizing all that stuff at the time, but it's handy now.  If anybody needs a dozen examples of any type of group you can think of, grab his old web pages:

But if you make that point, you have to deal with people coming back at you talking about talking to their customers on Twitter, promoting niche products on Twitter, arranging ad-hoc meetups when traveling on Twitter, getting direct feedback from their fans on Twitter, and it's much easier to pretend like 140 character broadcast messages are somehow tricky.<p>I also think it's disingenuous to suggest that Twitter's N x 1MM users are the product of 3 years of constant hype, when 1.5-2 years of that hype was confined to the Web 2.0 trade echo chamber.

6892392,comment,6889752,6890502,3,0,monsterix,,,"> vastu shastra, which is astrological woo.<p>I&#x27;d give you that in its current marketed form it is astrological bullshit, but originally <i>Vastu Shastra</i> was a formal form of science [1] grounded on engineering principles and urban design. All persevering to obtain a &#x27;calm&#x27; for the dweller.<p>One can still infer from the high precision N-S-E-W positioning of fairly huge ancient Hindu temples, historical remains of homes and dwellings, monasteries and other artefacts. Even the 1000+ step staircases in some of the forts and fortresses [2][3], transoceanic bridges [4] suggest the quality of math that was in play.<p>The choice and placement of stone, wood and metal w.r.t Sun, tropical climate and other ergonomic needs is simply mind blowing. Math has to be at the root of it.<p>Obviously not many records exist to substantiate the level of skill and academia prevalent at the time. I wish someone undertook a journey to research and substantiate just about &quot;everything&quot; that we have from Egypt to Indonesia (Hindu kingdoms spanned that far, yes!). At the risk of being shooed away by existing pride.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastu_shastra"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vastu_shastra</a><p>Even the wikipedia here, for example, says ... &quot;while Vastu had long been essentially restricted to temple architecture...&quot; which is completely wrong, and they defeat it in the third paragraph where they define &quot;the Sanskrit word vastu means a dwelling or house with a corresponding plot of land&quot; which is what Vaastu Shastra was all about, not temples alone.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChandBaori.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChandBaori.jpg</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chand_Baori"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chand_Baori</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Bridge"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Bridge</a>",1386813520

6892348,comment,6890839,6891930,4,0,drone,,,"> Lots of awful laws were &quot;the law of the land&quot; for much longer.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as awful as you make it out to be.  I think the situation before it was passed into law was far, far worse for the prosperity of individuals than it has ever been after.  But, that&#x27;s just, you know, my opinion.<p>> You implied irrationality among non-accredited investors, with your question, &quot;how can you make a rational decision...?&quot; Well, non-millionaires can be just as rational as millionaires, within these domains.<p>No, I didn&#x27;t, as I assume you&#x27;re familiar with securities law, I would presume that you could see that I was contrasting registered securities with required disclosures, and unregistered securities with little or no disclosure.  Perhaps I should&#x27;ve phrased the question instead as &quot;How can you make a good decision when the other party is intentionally hiding relevant information from you?&quot;<p>> If compromise is required, I&#x27;d replace the means test with a means-oblivious competence-evaluation:<p>That sounds awfully complex to codify.  Who gets to write the questions?  What happens when the subject is not previously coded up into a test?  Endless questions.<p>What this all really boils down, what I&#x27;m getting from this, is that you feel that you&#x27;re smarter than the average bear, and you feel that the rules are holding you back from really succeeding, so let&#x27;s make some rules that you&#x27;ll pass.  That&#x27;s not intended as a personal insult, that&#x27;s just how it comes across.<p>> If even more compromise to paternalism is required, private-security investments could be subject to a proportion-of-net-worth test. For example, perhaps only 1/2 to 1/3 of net-worth could be placed in such securities. Or, only an amount that&#x27;s less that that already saved in tax-advantaged retirement accounts (IRAs/501ks/etc).<p>Actually, that makes a lot more sense than anything else you&#x27;ve come up with, and more akin to my reading of the reasoning behind the means test. It has nothing to do with any one individual, but instead to avoid massive culling of the fortunes of the middle class at once and causing social unrest.  If its more difficult for the masses to invest primarily in high risk investments that more often fail than succeed, then they will likely invest in lower-risk, or at least more well codified risk, which is more likely to achieve a more stable economy and reduce the risk of public upheaval. We have a lot of history in the unregulated investment markets to draw from in painting a picture of the potential future.  Your assumption that people have more information now, readily available to them about the quality of investments with little or no disclosure is one I&#x27;d call into question.  People in the &#x27;teens certainly felt they had a lot more information about the quality of investments with little or no disclosure than they did in the early 1800&#x27;s.<p>But, we have a stark difference of opinion.  I never felt that the accredited investor test was holding me back from succeeding and making good investments. In fact, I&#x27;ve never found a rule that was really holding me back from succeeding, but that&#x27;s just me, I guess.",1386812980

They are following the PC model, which means that they are not targeting mainstream consumers. Consumers who want to buy Steam Machines will have to be knowledgeable on what to buy, they will have to look at specs and understand that that box is more powerful that the other one, and get what that means for their games. It&#x27;s very different from providing a single box and telling consumers &quot; as long as you buy a PS4, you can play all PS4 Sony games&quot;. So, please tell me how they will solve that problem for the mainstream, because their strategy does not address it at all.<p>To me, they are still targeting PC gamers (and Gabe clearly said so, too) and they want to expand that segment from the top, not from the bottom. Maybe they will attract some PC gamers who did the switch to consoles a couple of years back, by providing something better than consoles while still &quot;living-room&quot; centric.<p>I think their strategy is however the following:\n- a Steam gamer currently is usually a guy in front of the PC in his room. \n- By putting a Steam machine in the living room, it offers the opportunity to open up Steam to family members.\n- Oh, by the way the family games management feature was introduced about the same time as the SteamOS release this year... what a coincidence huh ?\n- So they plan to expand through immediate social environment first, not necessarily targeting hardcore console users. That way they will create awareness progressively. That&#x27;s why I am saying they are in for the long run.<p>Just like Steam was not made to replace from Day1 the box retail business, SteamOS&#x27;s strategy will not replace consoles from Day1 either. Maybe it will be a big player in 10 years from now, but I don&#x27;t expect any significant market share any time soon.",1386812715

It&#x27;s happened to my roommate during his virology research--they do monitor these things[1].<p>BUT, more importantly--you don&#x27;t even need fancy biotech to <i>engineer</i> a terrible virus. No sequencing, recombinant DNA, fancy BSL-4 labs, well-educated virologists, none of that. All you need is a captive population, something any self-respecting evil warlord should be able to get. (Certainly the North Koreans, the Taliban, etc. have access to plenty of prisoners.)<p>The same simple mechanism used by Fouchier (the guy who created the controversial bird/ferret superflu) can be applied to humans: serial passage. Put any moderately bad flu virus in a certain number of prisoners, then expose them via air circulation to other prisoners. Take the sickest people from the second group and expose them to another uninfected group via air circulation. After five or six passages the virus in the last group will show extraordinary virulence and transmissive capabilities because you&#x27;ve applied artificial selection.<p>To seed the virus and start an attack, you take a few of these prisoners, expose them to the worst virus, and put them on planes to your target country while they are still in the incubation/transmissive period.<p>Obviously, this is a nightmare scenario that I hope never happens, but the idea that terrorists or evil dictators need fancy science to engineer superbugs is false.  The same methods farmers have used for centuries to grow taller corn and leafier lettuce can be applied to viruses by anybody with enough prisoners and moral depravity.<p>[1]: It should be noted that in-house synthesizing costs are coming down, though, and we won&#x27;t be able to rely on the safeguard of companies automatically BLASTing ordered sequences against a CDC blacklist for much longer.",1386812551

Expensive, time-consuming, and probably failing 90% of the time, but accessible nonetheless.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say engineering a superflu is at all expensive or time-consuming and the failure rate can be a <i>lot</i> lower than 90%.<p>Here&#x27;s how you make a super virulent flu strain (targeting humans) using ZERO fancy genetics technology.  No sequencing, recombinant DNA, fancy biological labs, knowledgeable virologists, none of that.  All you need is a captive population, something any self-respecting evil warlord should be able to find.  Certainly the North Koreans and the Taliban have access to prisoners.<p>You use the same simple mechanism used by Fouchier (the guy who created the controversial bird/ferret superflu): serial passage, except on humans.  Put any moderately bad flu virus in a certain number of prisoners, then expose them via air circulation to other prisoners.  Take the sickest people and expose them to another uninfected group via air circulation.  After five or six passages the virus in the last group will show extraordinary virulence and transmissive capabilities because you&#x27;ve applied simple artificial selection.<p>The last step is seeding, wherein you take a few of these prisoners, expose them to the worst virus, and put them on planes to your target country while they are still in the incubation/transmissive period.<p>Obviously, this is a nightmare scenario that I hope never happens, but the idea that we need fancy science to make worse viruses is false.",1386812148

It&#x27;s broadly understood to be a sigil for victim-blaming precisely because it&#x27;s totally disconnected from the actual nature of rape and won&#x27;t actually reduce your risk of rape. Therefore, it&#x27;s presumed to be pretext.

Telling someone to exercise caution, because being right doesn&#x27;t undo the trauma of victimization, is also orthogonal to victim-blaming.<p>Let&#x27;s recap:<p>&quot;You deserve to be victimized because you took that photo/used a weak password/gave out your SSN over e-mail&quot; is victim-blaming.<p>&quot;Be careful who you give nude photos to/use a strong password/don&#x27;t give out your SSN over e-mail&quot; is cautionary advice that is orthogonal to victim-blaming.<p>More to the point, saying that the world should be a certain way does not make it that way. You should be able to drive on New Years Eve without being victimized by a drunk driver. But the world is not that way and it&#x27;s prudent to exercise extra caution on holidays because there are more drunk drivers on the road. You should be able to walk down the streets of Wilmington, DE without being mugged. But the world is not that way and I still drive my wife home from work each night. You should be able to trust people with private information. But the world is not that way and it&#x27;s prudent to keep anything that could be used against you close to your vest.<p>Being morally in the right does not erase the trauma of victimization, and giving advice that might reduce the chance of victimization is not automatically pretext for victim-blaming.",1386811193

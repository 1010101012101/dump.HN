It is interesting that you defined a philosophy where a person should take moral credit for never outgrowing their infantile narcissism. But Steve Jobs is a strange moral model, since some people believe he was simply amoral. Personally, I think it is often the primitive, constant focus on self that prevents us from making the most of our lives.",1370462358

It is <i>not</i> a matter of ""personal preference."" (It is absurd to say, ""It is merely my personal preference to live well by honest means. Others may choose differently, and live well by dishonest means."") If I lied to my wife, or cheated a customer out of money, <i>I</i> would suffer, and that's an inescapable fact.

Or even someone that just does one of the three, occasionally.<p><i>There's a categorical difference between logical claims (which are abstract and which are true or false independent of factual context), fact claims (which are, in principal at least, subject to objective validation as true or false), and value (including moral) claims (which are statements of personal preference).</i><p>Sigh. In relation to an individual person's life, for every <i>is</i>, this is an <i>ought.</i> For example, suppose that I am driving my car down the highway.

That's what brick and mortar places usually try to do before closing (if they didn't go bankrupt). I could imagine an enterpreneur wanting to take over a working product with an existing brand and a customer base instead of building it from scratch.<p>Seems like this business could be run by a 1- or 2-person team, which would be ideal for an independent developer with the right skills. A running product that doesn't take off and limps along might just be what these people are looking for. Manage 3-5 part-time projects like this, and a couple could live comfortably in whatever location they choose.<p>I suppose in this case, there were factors such as a shared backend with other in-house products, so it couldn't be extracted and switched to someone else's server.

5828106,comment,5827271,5827452,4,0,pash,,,"Over the past two or three decades in the United States there has in fact been a big shift away from targeted anti-poverty programs in favor of just giving cash to the poor. At the federal level, this has meant big increases in the earned-income and child tax credits and relatively less funding for housing and food subsidies and other hand-outs in kind.<p>The idea that people can allocate resources for themselves better than somebody else can do for them has an interesting tie-in to today's debate about what policies we should pursue to stimulate economic growth. The basic Keynesian proscription for reviving a moribund economy is to put idle resources to work through more government investment, and for many years economists have tried to figure out which investments offer the best bang for the buck by measuring fiscal multipliers, etc. But this approach assumes that a dollar of output is a dollar of output, when in reality—if we're doing economics, and not mere accounting—people often value a dollar's worth of one good very differently from a dollar's worth of another. (And a disparity between accounting value and economic value is likelier to exist when investment decisions are made by politicians, at a remove from the mainstream of economic activity.)<p>This suggests we should try to allocate stimulus spending in a way that mirrors as closely as possible the distribution of resources we'd get if our economy were chugging along at a good clip, with all our people and capital doing the things the market would arrange if were working properly. Greg Mankiw, the chairman of the Harvard economics department, wrote a paper with his colleague Matthew Weinzierl [0] a couple of years ago that tries to get at what that would look like. Their simple model suggests, unsurprisingly, that traditional make-work government investment programs should be a last resort: getting the same amount of money into the hands of investors and consumers who can allocate it more effectively might be, well, more effective.<p>0. <a href=""http://scholar.harvard.edu/mankiw/files/exploration_of_optimal.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.harvard.edu/mankiw/files/exploration_of_optim...</a> [PDF]",1370461654

And that really does make a difference - I've been the victim of credit card fraud once, I just notified by card provider and got the money right back, and therefore it effected me far less than if they broke into my home and stole my computer.<p>And secondly: <i>""when a child is molested, it doesn't matter if he or she is not harmed physically""</i><p>Really? In the burglar analogy is that not the same as saying ""if someone breaks into your home it doesn't matter what they steal""?<p><Got a bit confused here, not sure if I posted the above alone and then kept writing more below, or... so think this was an edit point here.><p>Let's say you and I were walking along and discovered an adult having sex with a young child somewhere. The adult runs off. I then walk up to the child and punch them in the face - do you think ""well that punch doesn't matter""? Assuming not, why is it different if that pain is caused by the sexual abuser as opposed to a different person? And/or why is it different if that pain is caused by a punch after the abuse or by the abuse itself? You do then go on to suggest that actually it is better if the child isn't physically hurt.. which seems like disagreeing with yourself.<p>> <i>And as I said before, it doesn't place any more responsibility on the child, nor any less culpability on the abuser.</i><p>First off, I hope in none of my comments have I at any time suggested any responsibility be assigned to children in these situations. I can't see where I might have, but if I have.. it was by accident.<p>As to culpability, well I think it's a bad word since in my understanding of it that is much more binary in this sort of situation, and yes I would say both adults are 100% ""culpable"".<p>Think of it another way: if you were forced to chose between a child having sex with an adult and the child not minding it (at the time of the abuse, who knows how they will feel in the future) or a child being physically forced to have sex with an adult and crying as it happens, would you still think ""doesn't matter which""?<p>In my opinion, your opinion is being clouded based on the fact that both situations are still extremely serious, and extremely wrong. In either situation you and I would both despise their actions strongly enough that it would be irrelevant to analyse the exact act and try to define exactly how bad it is. But that doesn't mean there still is a scale.",1370461638

Shipping fast lets you iterate quickly based on lots of small pieces of feedback. This is a really effective way to build something that fits your users' needs.<p>In other domains, however, it may make a lot less sense to ship things rapidly. For example, in science and medical domains, it becomes important to validate carefully everything that you are shipping before you ship, because your audience has no tolerance for rough edges. Those audiences tend to be less willing to adopt half-baked/non-turnkey products as well, so first impressions count more.<p>I think you should think hard about who your audience is and how they will perceive your product before trying to ship things aggressively or patiently.",1370461589

Trust us: you'll like working with lawyers -- when they're paying you for a change. And they do pay us: we're comfortably cash-flow positive just two years after founding, and growing quickly.<p>We have many challenging problems, including machine learning, visualization, search, distributed systems, and nifty user interfaces. We're looking for generalists; we'll teach you (or you'll teach yourself) what you need to know.<p>We're a fun company, with an awesome location in downtown Berkeley, foosball, board games, and more (recent events: Warriors playoff game, ski weekend in Tahoe). We'll offer you a great salary, equity, health care, retirement with company matching, and a generous vacation schedule.<p>We are looking to fill 3 positions:<p>Software Engineer: We all wear many hats, contributing to a backend Java codebase that uses minimal XML. We use a lot of modern open source technologies: Lucene, Cassandra, AWS, etc. We have a separate Python codebase for performing offline work.

Good understanding of HTML/CSS/Javascript is a must, and a good eye for design is a nice bonus.

Currently, the amount of these 'channels' that is available is limited by 1) the amount of detectors that a lab is willing to build, and 2) how many tasks the user can simultaneously execute  which is typically very low.

There are at least two main issues I see:<p>1) Selection - It’s easy to sell the popular stuff.  It’s hard to sell the tail of demand.  Aggregating together big box retailers can never compete on selection. People want to order things together, from the same place.  Selection is crucial.<p>2) Supply Chain - It’s hard enough to have an effective supply chain when all the inventory is under your control. It will be nearly impossible to deal with N retailers supply chain systems - inventory availability, location, cross-company orders, etc and be efficient enough to make a buck.<p>Unless Google is willing to physically get in the game and manage some warehouses I don’t see this being much of a threat although it might provide some nice competition for next and same day orders.",1370459141

You calculate how much it costs a person to pay their basic living expenses: food, a decent place to live, maybe a transit pass. Then you pay everyone in the population that amount of money each month, unconditionally (no means testing).<p>I once calculated that such a system, if applied in Canada, would require something like a 36% flat income tax if it were entirely funded that way, and it would have a break-even point at about $65k annual income (below that, you receive more than you put in). I expect the situation in the US to be similar.<p>Part of that cost could be offset by reducing or eliminating existing welfare and social security programs, including food stamps, employment insurance, and subsidized housing. It would also let you eliminate minimum wage, since you no longer have to be concerned about wages covering basic living expenses.<p>There are a lot of questions about how this would affect an economy. Would it cause massive inflation? Unemployment? Substance abuse? Or would it be the most effective social program ever? I have no idea. But I think it's worth a try. My hunch is that you will see all of those negative effects increase somewhat (inflation, unemployment, substance abuse) or in some people, but that the positive effects will greatly outweigh the negatives.<p>You needn't implement it all at once. You could apply it first to a random sample, say 1% of the population. Those people receive basic income and pay the tax required to fund it. They would also become ineligible for the social programs that would be removed if you rolled it out nationally (the details of that part may be tricky). Only roll it out to the whole population if the results are positive after a few years.",1370459129

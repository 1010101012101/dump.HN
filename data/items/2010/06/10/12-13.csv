I posted 19 links within the span of a couple hours (around the time you posted this).<p>My submissions -- which spanned aerospace, commercial spaceflight, natural language processing, embedded computing, error-correction codes, etc. (three of which frontpaged) -- are far more on-topic for this community than the usual frontpage garbage. 15+ iPhone articles a day, ""Stephen Colbert makes Bing donate money"", or Steve Jobs <i>this and that</i> do not belong on the frontpage day in and day out. At least not on a site called Hacker News.<p>If you look in the New queue right now you'll see several Apple articles, mostly about whatever is already on the frontpage (getting upvotes no less). This isn't a personal crusade against clashing ideologies (I use Apple as an example several times because this site overflows with Apple news), just an attempt to bring a little more hacker back to this site and a little less Engadget.<p>I apologize to anyone whose non-Reddit quality submissions were bumped to page 2 over the course of those two hours.

Did someone with an axe to grind promote the blog post for you on another site, on facebook, or some IRC channel...on Colbert?<p>Respondents have to be randomly selected, and this is widely known.  But since polls generate traffic and engage the readership everybody looks the other way.   Even on esteemed sites like HN where everybody should know better - although I have faith that it's not done here for the purpose of generating traffic.<p>I'm an old fart, and ""journalism"" is an accolade that I would never bestow upon a techno-lust blog.  Still, this event is dubious.<p>But it's not like the poll was actual quantitative measurement, so the world didn't lose anything of value beyond whatever dubious value it had to fanbois and rabid detractors alike.",1276174563

The only reason the forum posters feel that way is because it was all they cared about; they wanted EVO to win this meaningless poll.  If we take Engadget at their word, they probably didn't even look at the poll when deciding to remove the article; they were more concerned about the quality of the article itself.<p>My point is, I agree with you; I hate manipulative media as well.  That's why I think that on HN, we should not be using sensationalist titles with unconfirmed inferences like the one in the title of this post, and we should be discussing this from a more neutral point of view.   Otherwise we're just as guilty as anyone else.",1276174549

And the final digit is calculated by the Luhn algorithm.<p>So, of the 19 digits, 9 are fixed.  So you've got 10 possible digits.

The interpreter is easily embeddable, and you can call C functions from it. All of this makes for pretty rapid development without sacrificing speed for the things that it is suitable for.",1255903759

You could have talked to your community/potential buyers easily.  Ask HN: How much would you pay for a wolfram alpha iphone app? and Ask HN: How much would you pay for API access? would have resulted in more than enough initial market research.",1255903759

Why? Bandwidth but the a result is cleaner SERPs elsewhere. I guess I'm just pure evil?<p>I do things like name URLs for the content they contain, not /item?id=887743 but /why-not-to-hire-an-SEO - letting people know the content of a link before they click it; evil I guess?<p>Then there's optimising for speed to improve user retention, gzip enabling, trimming needless scripts and CSS, ... (WW looks like it could be leaner). I consider this part of ""SEO"".<p>It's not all bad you know.<p>And I reckon you could do better ... ;0)>",1255903542

9734443,comment,9731193,9731232,0,0,dasainz2,,,"The point of the interviews is seeing the value of a SW developer as a thinker and try to see their thinking process. Up to that point, I agree. However, not-so-complicated questions can be enough, and if interviewers try to make interviews more sophisticated, the interview degrades, in my opinion. Interviewers can ask an engineer for a way to find loops in a list, hoping that they find Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Tortoise and Hare&quot; algorithm. Well, you either know the algorithm or you don&#x27;t, but for sure you don&#x27;t come up with it in 20 minutes (I believe Floyd himself didn&#x27;t either). So are we measuring how the engineer thinks or how much they have prepared for the interview?",1434567591

An enormous amount of things and at the same time the most important things that make you a great software developer are completely language agnostic. And I would argue they are harder to learn through the lens of a single language and software stack. You then still have to become a productive software developer knowing your libraries and tools and their quirks but this seems secondary to me and easily compensated by your favorite search engine. Or by example - knowing when to use a set as opposed to a list is more important than knowing in which namespace you can find the implementations for language X.",1434567474

But it was when I tried to dig deeper into it that I felt lost, and yes, stupid. I&#x27;ve never been a math whiz; I am great at visualizing concepts but truly grasping the theory behind them is where I get lost. Based on my junior high school testing, I was placed in Advanced Algebra in my first year of high school. I nearly failed the class because it took me all year to grok the distributive property. I look back on that and I feel ashamed, because once I understood it, it seemed so damn simple!

I find your color argument unconvincing, but even if it were valid, I&#x27;m sure Uber and their drivers would be open to putting identification on their cars if it granted them access to desirable customers. Additionally, it&#x27;s not as if increased competition among firms who can respond to a hailing customer will inherently increase congestion due to street hailing. This would only be true if existing companies were (a) underserving the market so significantly that the ability to hail additional cabs from the curb allowed previously unmet demand to be satisfied, or (b) demand for street hailing itself were to increase. I think (a) is possible, though unlikely, because hailing from an app is generally more convenient than standing on a curb and flagging down cabs. I think the same would apply for (b).

Playing chess - practice - is very important for improvement. When you play chess (over the board, at tournaments), you put into practice what you have learned, you use your brain to think chess, you are in the testing environment, you test your accumulated knowledge and skill against another person.
However, too much play and too little study holds you back. You can repeat the same mistakes over and over. You will tend to follow your own old patterns and not have time to develop a different, correct thinking process, and to learn proper strategy and new ideas. 
In this case, you should take a long break from playing and concentrate only on study for several months. You will make a significant improvement.</i><p>In my experience, the first chess book I read (Logical Chess, Move by Move) probably bumped my rating by 400 points. Then, more specialized openings and tactics books another couple hundred. After that, simply playing got me mostly nowhere.",1434566328

</code></pre>
But the following Rust code is not legal:<p><pre><code>  let foo: u32 = &quot;3&quot;.parse();  // error: mismatched types
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s impossible to use the return value of parse as though it&#x27;s a u32, because it&#x27;s not a u32. You can&#x27;t accidentally add it to some other number or use it to index an array, because it&#x27;s the wrong type entirely. You invariably must acknowledge the possibility of failure, and if you&#x27;re okay with terminating your thread in the event of an error you can do this via an unwrap:<p><pre><code>  let foo: u32 = &quot;3&quot;.parse().unwrap();  // just fine
</code></pre>
Rust&#x27;s parse is even more explicit than C#&#x27;s TryParse, because even with TryParse it&#x27;s possible to forget to check the return value:<p><pre><code>  uint foo;
  uint.TryParse(&quot;Hello&quot;, out foo);  // this compiles and runs!
</code></pre>
And it&#x27;s not just about string parsing. The overarching point here is that not only does the compiler protect you from errors that you know about, it also brings your attention to errors that you didn&#x27;t know about. The OP has a great example in that it&#x27;s very easy to forget that the `min` method on vectors can fail if that vector is empty.<p>Finally, this assurance extends in the other direction as well: knowing that libraries are architected to make errors explicit via return types means that if I don&#x27;t get yelled at for not handling a return type, then I have peace of mind knowing I&#x27;m not overlooking anything. This is somewhat analogous to the considerable assurance given in knowing that types aren&#x27;t implicitly nullable.<p>Now, if you&#x27;re looking for something that can still go wrong, there&#x27;s a better example then OOM: dividing by zero in Rust will implicitly panic. So while it&#x27;s unlikely that a library author will use unwrap in their code (there&#x27;s a strong culture against Rust libraries causing panics), it&#x27;s possible that a library author could accidentally cause a panic by dividing by zero.",1434566187

If Uber drivers feel that they don&#x27;t have access to typical benefits like good healthcare, life insurance, disability insurance/workers comp, etc. then it would seem that one solution is to make these things easily available to people who are not full-time employees. And that would help millions of non-Uber citizens as well.<p>Another solution is what the court is ruling here, to force Uber to take on the complexity and cost. I can&#x27;t see how this could actually be better for anyone involved in the long run. Uber will just raise their cut of the fares to cover the costs of benefits so drivers won&#x27;t actually take home more money. I suppose it&#x27;ll get a lot harder to fire drivers so maybe some will benefit from that?<p>In any case, I honestly feel like it would be more reasonable if this driver could sue the state of California for not making benefits easily available to 1099 workers.

I tend to take a very suspicious view point on government intervention to control prices.  I look at high level tech jobs, and to me, it looks like they generally require majoring in the hardest undergraduate subjects, and often (sometimes preferred, sometimes required) require gaining admission to top programs with high standardized test scores and GPAs, and finishing grad programs with much higher attrition rates than elite med, law, or business schools (UCSF&#x27;s medical school attrition rate is below 0.5%, whereas top PhD programs often have attrition rates of 50%.  MS programs are harder to find data on - all I could get was aggregate (rather than elite) and it was behind a pay wall, but I believe it was 25-30%).<p>Although an MS is shorter than a med degree, and a PhD is about the same amount of time (considering residency), keep in mind, we&#x27;re also talking about a &quot;shortage&quot;, so I think it&#x27;s reasonable to take a generous view of what compensation should be.  I&#x27;d say people with grad degrees in math heavy STEM fields - even MS degrees, should probably be on a par in terms of salary and career stability with medical specialties before we should be talking too seriously about a &quot;shortage&quot; that wouldn&#x27;t simply be explained by uncompetitive wages and working conditions.  So overall, if it&#x27;s relatively straightforward to earn over $300k a year with a grad degree from a top 20 engineering school, then I&#x27;d be more open to the notion of a &quot;shortage&quot;.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d say that people are just making economically rational decisions to stay out of STEM jobs, considering the skill and academic ability required to get grad degrees in this field.<p>I know that would cause sticker shock, but I&#x27;d say that if the average mid-career industry salary is much below 300k for these degree holders (to say nothing of job stability), I have trouble believing it isn&#x27;t a crutch to avoid competing for workers who can participate freely in labor markets.",1434565792

This is especially complicated because, in the United States, too much of the social safety net is explicitly tied to employer-employee relationships (workers comp, unemployment, healthcare, etc).<p>What I want is confidence that somebody providing a service to me is provided these benefits - if you work 40 hours/week in &quot;on demand&quot; jobs, you should receive commensurate coverage from the safety net, and you should receive at least the mandated minimum wage. If you work 10 hours in a week, you should receive the pro-rated equivalents of those services. This is, of course, complicated - how do you account for people working two services at the same time, or the &quot;uber on the couch&quot; issue, or who pays for vehicles and other capital goods. But pretending that existing labor laws will cover the changing workforce is silly.<p>We hear all the time about how the nature of work, especially service work is changing. It seems like a logical consequence that the nature of how society classifies, supports, and regulates work should also change. Uber, et al, and their VC comrades have a huge opportunity to shape the future of how people work, and how the social safety net works - to effect real disruption.<p>Based on their actions, however, it is hard to conclude that Uber, et al are actually interested in this discussion, beyond the marketing rhetoric it enables.

9733988,comment,9731330,9733616,0,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Failed&quot; is too strong. Many of them are good ideas for certain use cases, but also have certain well-known problems, which is frankly true of everything.<p>Event-based programming was not discovered by Node. It was the dominant paradigm for decades, plural, on the desktop, and still is how all GUIs work, on all platforms, current and past. I&#x27;ve got a big blog post on deck about this one, actually, so I&#x27;ll save the well-known pitfalls for that.<p>All of the async stuff that they&#x27;ve come up with has been tried before, and none of it is a miracle cure, though some of them are certainly better than callback hell. Still, many of them still have well-known problems with composability and program flow comprehension. This has been a rich source of people overestimating how green the grass is on the other side; for instance, Python has everything ES6 is going to have anytime soon, and it&#x27;s still fairly klunky in many of these cases, IMHO. Not to mention the fact I&#x27;ve been outright <i>stunned</i> to see people in 2015 rehashing claims that cooperative multitasking is superior to preemptive multitasking because it gives you &quot;more control&quot; over the performance, which is roughly up there with seeing someone actively advocate for spaghetti programming because it gives you &quot;more control&quot;.<p>Reactive programming dates back to Visicalc (note the fourth paragraph of the wiki page cites spreadsheets as an example); it has well-known problems with cyclic dependencies, which are <i>shockingly</i> easy to accidentally introduce. It strikes me as likely that the nature of web pages will tend to contain this problem, unless you&#x27;re literally building a spreadsheet; this strikes me as one of the better tech fits. (The more you partition your problems structurally with &quot;pages&quot; and discrete &quot;submissions&quot; to the server, the less likely you are to spaghetti tangle your data flows accidentally, the way a single-spreadsheet application can so easily. The structure induced by the web is in this case harnessed to your advantage.) I wouldn&#x27;t try to build a game with reactive programming, though.<p>The idea of using &quot;binding&quot; in your UI, as in Angular, was actually tried by multiple GUI technologies, and generally was hard to work with at scale (made easy things easy and medium things very hard). I&#x27;m pretty sure Microsoft had it at least twice on the desktop and once in ASP.Net; none of them stuck. The same effect may save you here, though... GUIs are generally in &quot;pages&quot; as well. Less sure about that. Adding binding to a pre-existing language can also cause inner platform effect, where you have to embed a full language for expressions inside the original programming language: [1] But this is one of those cases where advances may make something more practical than it used to be... dynamic scripting languages require a lot less work to make that work than the olden days, where the fact you were <i>literally</i> writing a new inner language <i>really</i> sucked (i.e., lots of new bugs the outer language didn&#x27;t have).<p>Going to a bit of a wider range, NoSQL databases preceded SQL databases, which are called <i>SQL</i> databases precisely because there were databases, <i>then</i> there were SQL databases. Non-SQL databases had problems with being non-standard and causing your application to be too intimately tied to one of the very pieces of the tech stack most likely to fail one of your requirements and need replacing. That said, I will also point out that SQL databases really were in some sense too successful, and they should never have been the &quot;only&quot; choice. (But too many underinformed people still read too much hype and flee SQL databases when they really shouldn&#x27;t.)<p>And I&#x27;ll end my message with a clear restatement of my point, so it&#x27;s both the beginning and the end: The point is very much NOT that any of these things are &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;failed&quot;... the point is that they are <i>not new</i>, and it would be advantageous to look back at our historical experiences with the tech where possible to learn what the pitfalls are. This is something that both the people writing the techs ought to be doing, and even if they do, the people using the techs really ought to as well, especially when it comes time to decide <i>which</i> tech to use.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/expression</a>",1434564444

What are you going to do any differently with that than you would FileIsLockedException or NetworkIsDownException or HarddriveIsCorruptException? You wouldn&#x27;t do anything differently. Show the user the ErrorMessage in the dialog and allow them to restart whatever operation was in affect. Let them choose a shorter path, close Excel, plug their Ethernet cable back in, or whatever. Trying to play wack-a-mole is a fools errand.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this viewpoint. If a file is locked, the user may be able to fix it, so go ahead and display an error. But if there is corruption, then what is the user going to do? You can&#x27;t tell them, &quot;Restore your system from backup, and then click OK.&quot;  Your program has to crash before it causes more problems.<p>What if the situation is stack corruption or heap corruption?  Or what if the error left the application in an inconsistent state?  Continuing to run might corrupt the user&#x27;s data.  What if an attacker caused the corruption in order to gain unauthorized access?  Logging or displaying the error might be exactly what they want.<p>I often see variations of this advice: If you don&#x27;t know how to handle it, don&#x27;t catch it.  By definition, you don&#x27;t know how to handle an unknown exception.<p>> Put MSDN away, you don&#x27;t need it.<p>I think it is a good idea to understand the behavior and failure modes of every API function that you call; this requires that you consult the documentation.",1434564015

When people ask me how I put up with the rain in Seattle, I just reply back ""how do you put up with the snow?""<p>Seattle has a great diverse ecosystem for outdoors enthusiasts - drive for an hour or so, and you can go skiing, hiking, swimming, camping and more.<p>Seattle has a great craft beer culture as well. Some of my favorite bars are: Brouwers, Uber, Naked City, Beveridge Place Pub and Collins Pub.<p>If you want authentic mexican, check out Oaxaca in Ballard. As for taco truck food, check out El Camion in the parking lot of Home Depot on 135th and I-99 Aurora as well as Taqueria Tequila on 85th.<p>For Chicago style stuffed pizza, check out Delfino's in University Village and stay far away from Kylie's in Fremont (ugh)...for normal pizza, try Serious Pie, Flying Squirrel and Via Tribunali.<p>For breakfast, try Beth's Cafe and CJ's (my favorite eggs benedict)<p>For italian, try Cafe Lago. Great pasta.<p>For sandwiches - my 2 favorite places are Salumi's where you should try the Mole & Mozz. Salumi's is a few blocks away from where the Seahawks play. Second place is Tat's where they have the town's best philly cheese steak sandwich.<p>For ice cream, Molly Moon's wins hands down. They are in Wallingford as well as Capitol Hill.<p>Enjoy!",1319173020

""With Chinese wages rising at about 17 percent per year and the value of the yuan continuing to increase, the gap between U.S. and Chinese wages is narrowing rapidly Products that require less labor and are churned out in modest volumes, such as household appliances and construction equipment, are most likely to shift to U.S. production...Support from state and local governments can tip the balance.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.bcg.com/media/pressreleasedetails.aspx?id=tcm:12-75973"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bcg.com/media/pressreleasedetails.aspx?id=tcm:12-...</a>",1319172587

He now does medical research, at 25.<p>Dave's parents placed a lot of emphasis on educational achievement, and it paid off.  His brothers are similarly successful, and this attitude pervades Jewish culture in away that can't be said of society as a whole.

Even if you can somehow prove he's objectively wrong on the merits, his perception would still be a useful data point.<p>On the other hand I wouldn't expect any particular insight into our school problems from him, beyond what any reasonably skilled businessman could present.",1319169978

Most of the money paid in SS taxes always went right back out to recipients.  For awhile the government was collecting more than it was paying out (for demographic reasons) and the surplus was borrowed by the government.  But I believe at this point the program has a negative cash flow, so the government will have to issue new bonds to pay off the bonds in the ""trust fund"".<p>It's really a lot like your right pocket borrowing from your left pocket.",1319169815

What does ""Linkify"" do? It scans free-form text for recognizable items (e.g. URLs, email addresses, phone numbers, etc. Apple originally did something similar with the Mac help system and patented it in 1996 and is now suing HTC, etc. over the functionality.<p>To me, this is an open-and-shut example of Apple attempting to claim ownership of an unrealized idea. What do you think?<p>Oh, by the way, I almost forgot the best bit. Even if you do think this is patentable, there is an open-and-shut example of prior art. Netscape Navigator 2.0b1, released in 1995, included ""Live URL"" support within its mail and newsgroup client, which does exactly what you think it does.<p>Apple claims it has a patent that can prevent Android from doing the same thing today. To me, this is an obvious abuse of the patent system (and I feel similarly about slide-to-unlock, photo gallery scrolling, ...).<p>I'm not saying Apple has no quality technical patents (the design stuff is a whole different discussion), but I'm <i>very</i> skeptical of the ones they're asserting against Android manufacturers. By and large, they seem to revolve around functionality that, once you've seen it being used, you need no other technical information to reconstruct it. To me, that sounds like the look-and-feel lawsuit all over again, dressed up in patent clothing. In my opinion, if the change of outfit means the suit ends up going the other way, we will all be poorer for it.<p>And while I don't think a ""no patent"" system is the best answer, it does sound a lot better than the the current system of flimsy, overbroad patents leading to rampant patent abuse from all players. I'll add that I, personally, don't distinguish much between practicing and non-practicing entities, I care far more about the quality of what you're asserting than about who you are. I'd even argue that there are cases where a practicing entity abusing overbroad, flimsy patents to stifle competition in an area can be worse (for society) than a non-practicing entity merely trying to ""tax"" the same area.",1319169738

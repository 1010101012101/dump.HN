The media has a shitty way of framing things, but does that matter?  If ConnectU was at least somewhat close to facebook in traffic it would just be more press.<p>Money-  This part sucks.  I'm sure you spent a lot of money to defend your claims.<p>Health-  Mental health wise I probably could not go through what you went through.<p>Legal rights-  You can't patent or sue in court for traction.  Original FB was probably a mess of code.  Would you have wanted that anyway?  As for the patents on social networks Pincus and Reid Hoffman owned those anyway.  I think the whole notion of legally owning ""social networking"" is ridiculous.<p>Social relationships-  This part sucks.  I've never had to deal with this personally, so it's hard to empathize, but having friends in the middle of the situation sucks.  Acquaintances who don't even know the situation must be far worse.<p>Rebound potential-  You're an insanely bright guy, and I'm sure it's taken your toll on you, but you'll continue to succeed regardless.<p>Points in my article:<p>-Long term vision:  If Mark's goal was to just be thefacebook.com and focus on colleges, it wouldn't be what it is today.  Long term vision can come later, but you can't steal it with an idea.  Most people steal a snapshot with an idea, not the whole picture.<p>-Analytical insights:  The data points FB had early on (which colleges wanted to be let in the most) were without a doubt valuable.  It told them where to open up next.<p>Domain expertise: Depending on how in depth the problem is there may only be a few experts in the area.  If it's a broad thing such as Facebook, you could probably get equal talent.  I don't know you well, but I've read a lot of what you put out there.  I'd back you technically/logically against the original founders.<p>Talent: Founding talent is the real DNA of the company.  You can replicate it afterwards in hires due to money or being a hot startup.<p>Passion for great service:  It may not make you lose customers, but you will certainly keep them around a whole lot longer.  Zappos may have done well even if it were a slimy operation, but I doubt it would have done as well.<p>Luck:  Can't refute that argument.<p>It's great insight and we disagree on a lot of points, but I didn't go through the same experience you did.

I write for people to bring up thought, especially someone I respect like yourself who has deep understanding of the topic at hand.<p>-jlb",1279646577

Someone with more resources than me can copy my stuff very fast and beat me before I can get real traction. My most important competitive advantage is in the applied algorithms which I was refactoring so much; it is inside the source code. If they steal that, they not only steal my idea, they steal my execution. Of course they can also do it otherwise, but in that case it last more time. The key is in my opinion being ahead 1-2 years, especially in the beginning.  So it might be a good idea to obfuscate the code. On the other hand it is better to be open, so it would be cool if I could ship the complete source code so that customers or consultants could customize my product, (or write plugins) which is quite important in the case of this product.<p>It is a really hard decision whether to:<p>- ship only the obfuscated class files<p>- ship the non-obfuscated class files<p>- or ship the whole source code with the product.<p>Being too open too early can be dangerous.

The reason we are offering it, is because it fits very naturally with our architecture, and people who handle video through us will probably also like us to handle their images.<p>We do a few tricky things so. HTML5 multi uploading is one of them. We actually start resizing images as they come in, that means by the time you are done uploading 100 images, we are done resizing them. Another thing is upload progress without flash, that will usually require a custom-compiled web server of some sort. And there is meta data extraction and uploading to S3.

What other ideas do you have for sweetening the deal for a customer willing to signup for what is essentially vaporware?<p>Well, as I understand the term vaporwear, it means stuff that's never built that's never going to get built. It's a result of either a company grandstanding (Microsoft) or a company with perfectionism issues (Duke Nukem Forever). Taking preorders demonstrates that you're not grandstanding and forces you not to be a perfectionist. So I wouldn't call it vaporwear.<p>Beyond that, running a successful company people trust and delivering value to them helps immensely. Give them things for free - write a newsletter, write a free tool (even a simple one! simple tools are awesome), give some useful case studies, a blog, whatever. If Patrick McKenzie (patio11) announced that he was releasing an ebook in 30 days and charging $80, but it was $20 if you pre-ordered now, I'd jump on that in a heartbeat. Because I respect him, trust him, and would be happy to give him my money, and I know he'll deliver.<p>Beyond that - solid concept that's demonstrably possible in the real world. If you announce something that seems difficult to impossible and you haven't figured out how to get there from here, people will be skeptical. But if you're doing a version 2.0, or you're selling media (a book, an album, whatever) where people have seen dozens/hundreds examples of it created in the past, or if you're just known as a guy that always delivers - then you should be able to get some preorders.<p>Really though, I didn't take preorders for the cash, I didn't need the cash. I did it to make a promise to other people. Most people take promises to other people much more seriously than promises to themselves.",1279645586

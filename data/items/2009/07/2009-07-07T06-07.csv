Since when does money not matter in everything?  The entire point of all of this is to use commodity PCs to achieve linear scalability cost-effectively, and to escape relational structure for data ill-suited to relational schemas.<p>I don't think anyone is suggesting an online bank should not use existing commercial databases and SQL.",1246949910

Biggest one right now is 12 nodes.<p>And if it scales, but costs too much (a relative concept at best), then it somehow doesn't scale any more?<p>Of course cost matters, and it comes down to what your application requirements are, and what your revenue model is, and your risk management requirements are, etc., etc.<p>If you want to talk technology only, it's a no-brainer.<p>If you want to talk cost and context-appropriate implementation of technology, then provide a detailed context, not generalizations.<p>Again, you're not going to see an online bank use CouchDB as their back-end, and likewise, you're not going to see a relatively free service use stupidly expensive technology.",1246949781

691056,comment,690656,691037,0,0,nettdata,,,"For what it's worth, you can most definitely do that with Oracle.  I can't speak to Postgres scalability, but it is my DB of preference.  (I guess it might have something to do with the fact it's as close to Oracle as you're going to get in Open Source).<p>We design apps to treat the datasource as a network service, and have no problems load balancing DB connections across our database cluster, and adding new DB nodes as required.<p>The biggest problem I've seen is the relative lack of support for Oracle in something like Rails, or non-Oracle app servers in general.  I've had to custom write some connection pool failure detection for a few apps to deal with cluster failure (something that comes out of the box with the Oracle app server, but we wanted to use JBoss and GlassFish), so while it's not perfect, it's most definitely doable.<p>Just because his particular architecture or offering doesn't fit well with typical database deployment architectures, doesn't mean that ""SQL doesn't scale"".",1246949583

691044,comment,690656,691031,0,0,nettdata,,,"Firstly, I've never said that you couldn't build big stuff with MySQL or other Open Source tech.  But if you for a second think that MySQL has the same kind of performance and feature set as Oracle, you're sadly mistaken.<p>The example you have given has nothing to do with the technologies, and everything to do with the application requirements.<p>An Internet Banking site has the need for real-time, centralized, transactional updates.  There is no real option to cache a lot of stuff, or to delay the distribution of updates, or to shard/replicate data for reads, etc.  It also has the need for real-time transactional replication, sophisticated auditing, global fault-tolerance, etc., etc.  It's also a much more transactional site than something like Facebook.<p>Facebook's application requirements allow for a totally different set of tools to be used in a totally different manner.  The dynamics of the site also has a lot to do with how it can be built.  For example, Facebook is, for the most part, a read-only, fairly static site.  That makes things a HELL of a lot easier to build out with their choice of tech.  Same goes for SlashDot.<p>There are a ton of ways to build out something to the scale of Facebook, Slashdot, or LinkedIn using nothing but open source tools/technologies.<p>You cannot, however, build a realistic, large scale internet banking site using those same technologies.  The only option is something like Oracle.<p>That's why a truly scalable system is so much more than just bolting on a DB to make it scale.  It's about mapping the proper technology and tools to the business requirements, and figuring out how to deal with scaling issues before you even start to write a line of code.<p>Or, even better, abstract the database layer (Hibernate, etc), so that you can drop in more sophisticated DB technologies as you need to.<p>Just because something is free (MySQL), doesn't mean it sucks.  Likewise, just because something costs money (Oracle), doesn't mean it sucks.<p>But there are many reasons (some of them even technical) why lots of companies have no problem paying stupid money for Oracle.",1246948722

Sure, there's fluffy stuff printed every day, but there's also the kind of journalism and writing that you can't buy at .9c/word.<p>In this case, just look at the links to other Opinionator blogs on the right hand side of the linked article, for examples of stuff you won't find in any content farm.<p><pre><code>  * a five parts series on early computer scientists

2702507,comment,2701908,2702250,4,0,oinksoft,,,"Well, I don't see any good reason to write this in C. The operations performed are very basic, and it only obscures what you're doing. Further, your program relies on Ruby and Grit (that gem itself an onerous dependency) to do things that require neither tool. This seems to be the sort of thing that should either be in pure C if you really want that, or as a standalone script that requires nothing, given its simplicity. And if it were a standalone Python script, for instance, you could easily use the ""inspect"" module to write some inline source to file. All that Ruby source in a C header is a very odd decision to me.<p>If I were writing this with the understanding that it were not to work on Windows (which you seem to have decided, upon reading the source), I think I'd just use a simple shell script.<p>I will add that there is no good reason at all to require an ""init"" command, as that could be a simple get-or-set method when another command is used.<p>Viewing the commit history, you need to be far more careful with how you use git and how you define your .gitignore.",1309200851

The most robust fix to the problem is to ""optimistically replicate"" your application data to the end user's device, so that the network latency does not become part of the user experience.<p>This is a strong fit for applications like CRM or geographically constrained apps, as the data sets are small enough to fit completely on your devices. For larger data sets the issue becomes: which subset of the data should be copied to the device ahead of time.<p>The user should never needs to wait on the network. All data operations are played against the local Couch, which handles asynchronously transmitting changes to and from the remote server, in the background.

When you have a business function that goes from making you money to costing you, just fire everyone in that business function and sell it off. You quickly get rid of what's dragging you down and continue your profitable business functions. However, this also creates duplication of some jobs, waste, and an insidious bureaucracy where teams are fighting each other. (I could have read that section wrong, but that's what it reminded me of)

  - Engineering Swaps: Really? You just uproot people so they have to re-learn how something else works and take time away from getting stuff done? Couldn't you just do a couple hour-long knowledge sharing sessions between developers?
</code></pre>
Random thoughts<p>- Don't design too far ahead - doesn't fighting fires and coming up on sudden, unexpected deadline changes due to lack of foresight kind of drag on your employees? You can't keep overworked code monkeys forever. It's one thing to code ""quick and dirty"" to get a job done. It's another thing not to plan for the future.<p>- Put end to end responsibility on a single engineer - so when that guy's on vacation nobody knows how to fix the thing he owns that broke?<p>- Process - Doesn't say if you require change control, but some sort of change alert/control system is really useful to tell people when you're changing something which may affect others, so they can immediately see what could have affected the broken thing and call the person who could have broken it.",1309200494

    placebo controlled, rigorous nutrition studies.

  o The few that _have_ done these studies, have usually

So yes - most cereal (the exception potentially being anything your Paleo ancestors would have recognized as cereal) is probably bad for you.  I'll go farther than the OP and say you're probably kidding yourself if you think that ""Corn Flakes"" or ""Crispy Crunch"" is significantly better than ""Fruit Loops"" - it might be marginally better, but none of the refined stuff is doing great things for the western metabolism.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081533480X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/081533480X</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716743396"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716743396</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Nutrition-Metabolism-Sareen-Gropper/dp/0495116572"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Advanced-Nutrition-Metabolism-Sareen-G...</a>",1309197857

However everywhere mentioned on the 2-step authentication site ""Android 1.5"" is blared at me.<p>As a 1.5 user there is nothing that hacks me off more than getting my hopes up at an app my phone can actually use (a rare occasion these days) and then having it snatched away. I don't blame Google for supporting 2.x and up, but lies are unacceptable.",1309197855

And adding new customers doesn't significantly increase your cost. In this case you can afford to charge $1/month and take advantage of the volume.<p>You can provide limited support for basic accounts and charge much more for full support like $5-$9/month. The idea is to give your customers the only-pay-for-what-you-need model which is very realistic on the web.<p>If your cost increases significantly with each new customer you acquire then find what will increase your costs and charge extra for it, maybe bandwidth, computation, disk space etc.",1309197806

Not that I'm a saint who never cheats, lies or steals, but I am true, I don't pretend I'm someone I'm not, and I don't much care about looks, money, fame and other irrelevant things in life. Most people around me do the opposite, and care only about their perceived status in the group, would sell a friend for pennies, and pretend they care, but never really listen. I filter most of these people out of my life, and don't have many true friends that I would spend a lot of time with.<p>This only makes me more motivated to instill really strong moral values in my future children.",1309197793

4485911,comment,4484627,4485295,4,0,23david,,,"I agree. Static typing is great. I don't know why all these scripting languages choose to throw out static typing. If a variable is always going to be an integer I don't know why its important to be able to stick characters, strings or objects into it without seeing any errors. It's good for a beginning programmer perhaps, but even with that I tend to disagree since it encourages bad practices.<p>At some point I just got tired of seeing the same types of errors and wanted my tools to work a lot better. Python / PHP / Ruby aren't improved by lacking static types. How hard would it be to add static types into PHP, Ruby, or Python?<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1365333/will-php-become-a-full-fledged-statically-typed-oop-language-in-the-near-future"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1365333/will-php-become-a...</a>",1346961546

4485882,comment,4484627,4485746,1,0,chimeracoder,,,"Inferior (or 'unworkable', before you edited the comment)? Where are you getting that from? I never said that - I use Scala myself (and used to use it at work). <i>Java</i> is certainly inferior, because Java is OO done badly.<p>> ""When you apply parentheses surrounding one or more values to a variable, Scala will transform the code into an invocation of a method named apply on that variable.""<p>Now I've lost track of what you're quoting from, but that's by definition <i>very</i> OO. It's a modified form of the messaging pattern employed by Smalltalk.<p>Scala isn't a functional/object-oriented hybrid; it's purely object-oriented (even more so than Java) because it has one single kind[1]: the object (Java pretends to have one, but it really has five, if you <i>really</i> wanted to get pedantic).<p>So we shouldn't be celebrating Scala for being a functional hybrid - we should celebrate as being 'OO done right' (well, mostly right), which was the stated and failed intent of Java.<p>The distinction is subtle, but the important thing to remember is that I'm operating on the premise that proper OO is essentially a subset/extension of FP, not an alternative. So what I'm saying is that this doesn't show that Scala is 'more functional' (vs. 'less functional') - rather, it shows that Scala is <i>good</i> OO (vs. bad OO, ie Java). I agree that it's a bit like the 'white horse is not a horse' argument, but it becomes important when we start talking about non-white horses; ie, functional languages that <i>aren't</i> OO).<p>[1] I'm kind-of (no pun intended) abusing the term 'kind', but I can't think of a non-overloaded synonym as the moment, other than 'type' which would be worse.",1346961319

The methods were goal setting and cultivating an appreciation for the activity itself.<p>The goal setters improved faster and more of them had stuck with it after a short period of time. After a longer period of time the appreciators were just as proficient as the goal setters and more of them had stuck with it. A lot of goal setters quit in the medium term.<p>I remember the explanation being that goal setting drove better performance faster but the habit was more fragile and missing goals or reaching a plateau resulted in more quitting, while the appreciators just kept plodding along because they enjoyed it and were more successful long term.<p>I had no google luck finding that study again, and I have to get back to doing some real work but if anyone recognizes it please post the link.<p>I can't be only HN user who appreciates these types of articles when they tie in interesting <i>facts</i> a lot more than those that just have a well written argument based on personal experience and anecdote.

For Paypal, I fear it's too little too late.  You've done too much damage to yourselves.  I get the reasons why you do things, but the communication over the last years has been atrocious.<p>We're in the UK and are just waiting for Stripe to come over.  I think a lot of other businesses are thinking along the same lines as well.<p>Your fee structure is pretty expensive as well.  There's also a lot of hidden costs:<p>- We're on an upper tier so should have a reduced commission rate.  However, after scratching my head for ages as to why a majority of our sales are not at the lowered rate I finally find the link about cross border fees or whatever reason you use to charge us more. As an example, some of our $119 USD sales have $4.35 fees which is ~3.7%.  Our current rate it says on our account should be 1.9%.  Your fees structure is not as clear as it should be.<p>- Have you tried issuing a refund in a different currency?  You have to draw money from your bank (even if there are available funds), which is converted to the correct currency which because your spreads as so expensive means sometimes refunds cost us money.  I phoned up about this and they told me to open different currency balances which I did and which fixed the issue, but again, bad communication and a broken process<p>- Related to the previous point, your spreads on foreign conversions are high.  I think they've improved a bit over the last couple of years but I still consider them an expensive hidden cost.  I contacted Stripe asking what spreads they offer, and they told me they would consider it a hidden cost and they offer customers the same spreads the banks give them.<p>Also, your website is mind bogglingly slow.  See this support ticket I opened:\n<a href=""https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Access-and-security/Why-is-the-Paypal-website-so-slow/td-p/415889?profile.language=en-gb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.paypal-community.com/t5/Access-and-security/Why-...</a><p>The support person didn't do anything about it.  I didn't expect them to though, as Paypal is an impenetrable behemoth that doesn't seem to care about these sorts of things.<p>Your website being as slow as it is, mind numbingly slow, is honestly enough reason alone for me to move service.  Trying to find transactions just is a huge waste of my time waiting for each page to load.  Try using your sandbox with pages that load that slow.<p>> there's a massive culture change happening at PayPal right now. If we suck at something, we now face it, and we do something about it.<p>So can you make your website faster for a start?",1346958541

4485644,comment,4483569,4484113,4,0,JoshTriplett,,,"Not quite.  Wayland itself doesn't require any graphics-driver-specific code; it uses the standard kernel interfaces and graphics stack (Mesa, DRI, libdrm, KMS, etc).  That also works fine with radeon and nouveau, and it would work fine with the proprietary drivers as long as they support the standard graphics stack.  It just won't work with proprietary drivers that implement their own entirely un-integrated graphics stack, which seems unsurprising to me.<p>Your window manager of choice can just link into Wayland/Weston and ignore all the underlying graphics driver bits; they'll Just Work.",1346958096

Those who have grown in maturity or changed religious/political views don't really want some stupid thing they said 5 years ago to be a mere one screen-length from the top of the page.<p>I personally am irritated with the ""curated"" experience.  It ties in with sorting wall posts to ""top stories"" instead of by date.  I know there was a discussion last month I want to get back to, but FB has decided it doesn't show up on my timeline or my friend's timeline, because it only gives a selection of posts from that month.",1346958081

In fact, it's a gargantuan undertaking. Add a bunch of new end user features and you get that the amount of technical work that is going into WP8 is phenomenal. However, the windows phone engineering team is superb. I have no doubt's that both consumers and developers will be thoroughly impressed come holiday season.",1346958057

Humans just put 1 ton hover over another planet yet we still kill each other over which parts of which iron age books we think are more than just stories.<p>What we do know is that within a populous of a given scientific advancement its possible for there to be a massive variation of individual and group morality as well as individual education level (particularly in regards to science).  We know this because it's our current world.<p>Based on the reality we know about it isn't terribly apparent to me that just because some population has achieved a given level of scientific advancement that some of them won't gleefully steal my lunch.",1346958008

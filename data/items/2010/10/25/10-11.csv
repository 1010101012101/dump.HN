""Normal"" user applications just need to simplify their interfaces so that users actually end up keeping their files in there. File managers should have a simple interface so that users can work with files in there (and the interface should be simple enough that they actually do). File managers still need the current (""advanced"") interface for power users who need to mess with the system.<p>The Preferences argument made by the author is the same in my opinion. ~/Library/Preferences should be hidden by default.

Although 4 weeks trip with no access to computers - only new cities, mountains and heavy metal gigs - fixed me.<p>I've two big problems. First is I work from home. So sometimes I work 12-16 hours a day. By ""work"" I mean I sit in front of my laptop, but it doesn't mean I'm productive. Second problem is that being INTJ, I don't have much friends, so I usually end up staying at home for days (and coding most of the time) until I run out of groceries.<p>After I got back from my ""sanity trip"", I started doing several things to avoid burnout.<p>- Cycling. Used to do 30+ kilos almnost every day. Now it's getting cold here, so I do few short rides a week.<p>- Walking. If I'm not cycling, I try to get out of the house every day. Just to wander in downtown or get rolls from a bakery 15 minutes away.<p>- Eating out. I occasionally go for lunch with friends working nearby.<p>- Limiting my hours at keyboard. I moved most of my reading to Kindle, either in bed or outside. Previously, even after work-hours I was slipping from reading back to work easily. Kindle helps to avoid this.<p>- Meeting with friends at least once a week. Even if you think you don't have friends, try calling people you know and ask them out. There's a big chance that they have nothing to do as well :)<p>- Heavy metal. This helps me stay sane A LOT. Listening to records is good. Live shows are even better. After a nice (well, nice in metal way) gig I've energy for whole week. If you don't like heavy metal, listen to rock, classic, jazz or whatever you like. Listen not while working, but truly listen to music. And go to live shows. That's where music becomes Music.<p>So far, so good. I'm putting in less hours, but delivering more.",1288002886

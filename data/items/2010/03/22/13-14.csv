1210285,comment,1210014,1210014,0,0,JamieEi,,,"I'd start by trying to validate your business model.<p>1) You need to find out who the paying customers are in this space and what features they really want. It seems very possible that average consumers would have no interest in your service but that power users, marketers or some other segment might. Once you know where the interest is you can make better feature decisions. For example, you might find that reporting, not AI, is what drives marketing sales.<p>2) Fundemental improvements in AI are really hard. Look at the results of the first Netflix prize. Lots of world class teams worked on that problem and the winning solution only produced something like a 10% improvement in the results. If that's the only edge your business has over the competition I doubt consumers would even notice. On the other hand, AI has matured to the point where it's pretty easy to produce good results. I'd rather bet my business on predicatble, good results and treat it as a pleasant surprise if we make a fundemental breakthrough.<p>Good luck!",1269266049

If Google can merge the ChromeOS ""browser-centric"" interface with Android, then they could create a more seamless mobile <-> desktop experience.<p>However Apple is in the best position to do this.  If they can merge the desktop with the iPhone/iPad Cocoa Touch experience, then they can create a seamless experience from the ""digital hub"" to all the various mobile devices.  Just as a Unix-like command line lurks behind the OS X Desktop experience, a conventional Desktop could lurk behind an iPad-like experience.  Perhaps interfaces like the iPad could come to dominate the everyday user's experience more and more, while today's typical workstation becomes the sole province for deep experts.<p>(Remember the classic PC/Automobile analogy.  This would be like the disappearance of oil changes and spark plug cleaning and other home-garage tinkering from the routine experience of car owners, but if you are a true petrol-head, you can save some extra money and buy a MX-5 fitted out with a roll bar as a cheap, fun track car, which you'll have to spend lots of time with to maintain and fix to stand up to the wear and tear of serious driving.)",1269265780

It can be shortened to one sentence: Japanese are conformists, and therefor unlikely to be entrepreneurs. While certainly part of the problem, Japan used to be far more conformist, and companies like Sony and Nintendo still got started. Many of the companies, such as Hitachi, Toshiba and Panasonic were actually founded in the early 1900s, and later turned into hi-tech electronics companies when the opportunity appeared.<p>One issue is that most successful startups in the past two decades have been related to computer software, while Japan's strength has rather been electronic appliances.<p>Perhaps Japan needs to find a path of entrepreneurship that actually appeals to Japanese in their 20s and 30s, rather than desperately try to copy the valley?

1210230,comment,1210119,1210119,0,0,jswinghammer,,,"I think this is what happens when you lack a coherent explanation of the business cycle. If you think that speculation is the issue then things like this might be interesting. The real question is ""Was the speculation funded by inflation or savings?"" If it was funded by savings then failures aren't a problem. The capital is liquidated and the investors rebuild their savings and try again doing something. When debt is involved things get a lot worse in a fractional reserve system. The equity bubble of the 90s was largely fueled by inflation and the real estate bubble was as well. Both bubbles required bailouts. See the failure of Long Term Capital Management for more information on how the equity bubble of the 90s lead to instability.<p>""America's Great Depression"" by Murray Rothbard provides a good introduction to the Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle with a good historical analysis. Rothbard also covers alternative explanations of the business cycle. Even if you don't buy into the theory of the business cycle the book is worth reading just to learn just how involved in the economy Hoover really was.",1269264620

Yet someone had had the bright idea of (a) indicating an error with a dialog box instead of a return value, which brought the entire synchronous call to a screeching halt, and (b) reporting an absolutely useless error value.<p>It would have been more useful had the COM code in question /crashed/ -- at least I could have debugged it.<p>It's not just Microsoft, I've seen this ""error -1"" behavior in many APIs, on many systems. I've seen code that reported /any/ error as being ""out of memory"" (trying to blame it on someone else? I've never understood that one, if it's not just being lazy).<p>Detailed error reporting is as much of an art as designing the working face of an API.

1210226,story,,,11,16,bkovitz,"What's the easiest way to make a living?",,"What's the easiest way to make a living today?<p>By ""easiest"", I mean in terms of time and attention.  The idea is to have lots of time to work on projects that you enjoy.  That time has to be good ""maker time"", not time when you're mentally exhausted from working at a job that consumes you.  Think Einstein working at the patent office.<p>By ""make a living"", I mean enough money to pay the rent on a modest apartment, eat cheap food, and occasionally buy nice toys.  US$24,000/year is probably the minimum.<p>Inheritance, sugar daddy, and living off your parents are amusing cheap-shot answers, but that's not what I'm asking about.  I'm thinking that since technology has made us all so productive, it ought to be possible to work very few hours to make a passable living, and thus enjoy much more leisure time.  Most people don't do that, though.  People in the U.S. seem to be working harder than ever, but not getting much enjoyable leisure time.  What might we find if we looked seriously at how to earn a living in a way that leaves the most time available for person projects that probably don't make money?  Such projects could be anything from taking care of your kids to painting pictures to proving theorems.<p>Example: An entrepreneur friend of mine works four days a week as a cab driver, and spends his remaining time working on two small businesses.  The money from cab driving is terrible ($60/day, with a lot of variance), but it gives him time and freedom, and he enjoys cab-driving.  But let's not limit this to ""Ways to finance your start-up.""  Just, ways to pay your rent, long-term, while you work on whatever you like, regardless of financial return.",1269264488

(I haven't discussed this with the landlord yet.  I think I should be able to finesse this, but I'm a very, very quirky guy by definition because I come from the perspective that this is something that I can negotiate with the landlord rather than a condition he'll impose that I'll just have to accept.<p>Social acceptance doesn't stop at landlords and bank officers, either.  For example, take prospective in-laws.  You want to marry your daughter off to a nice young salaryman or a post office worker: he'll give her and your grandchildren <i>stability</i>.  You don't want to marry your daughter off to an entrepreneur: one bad quarter and your grandkids won't be able to afford cram school!<p>Without casting any aspersions on the motivations of parents of young ladies I may have dated, suffice it to say that for at least some people ""salaryman"" is such a good quality it trumps obvious negatives like ""he's, ahem, well... he spent a lot of time overseas.""<p>3)  Have you noticed how I use the world's most efficient distribution channel, the Internet?  Japan lags the US -- by quite a bit -- in the ""ads -> web page -> purchase consummated online"" space.

""I take credit cards.""  ""PEOPLE TELL YOU THEIR CREDIT CARD NUMBER!?""<p>Oh, the entire Japanese payments infrastructure is optimized around Big Freaking Enterprises rather than small businesses.  You know how painful it is to get a merchant account with no corporate history?  Think that ""about that painful, cubed"" for taking non-cash payments in Japan.<p>4)  I am sharply limited in what I can say of the Japanese government's entrepreneurial promotion activities having once been employed by a sub-branch of them (prefectural technology incubator).  Here's a general statement, make of it what you will: the government giveth and the government taketh away.<p>5)  Hypothetically assuming I were Japanese, my resume would read DAMAGED GOODS right now, because I had the brass ring (salaryman employment at a good company) and I let it go.  (Foreigners interact a little... quirkily... with a lot of Japanese social norms.  This is one of them.)<p>Let me try putting it in American terms: how attractive would YC be if it were widely known that Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and almost every other company worth working for considered anyone who either a) did not secure employment at graduation or b) has ever left a company as the moral equivalent of a felon?",1269263725

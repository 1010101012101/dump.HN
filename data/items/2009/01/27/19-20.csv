452614,comment,452005,452314,0,0,a-priori,,,"It's easy to make that mistake at first, but it is a very important distinction. Most of the time, for most processes, most of that space is unallocated. However, since it's basically impossible to change the size of the kernel area without relinking the process binaries, and since that area is shared between all processes, the size of that area has to remain fixed.<p>It is interesting that Linux and NT differ. Perhaps this is due to the fact that NT needs more kernel memory to house, e.g. the windowing system, whereas Linux systems put X in userspace? I'm speculating here.<p>Something I never considered: that design difference probably makes Wine's job easier, because between the 2GB and 3GB marks is a region of memory the Windows process assumes is inaccessible, yet in Linux is in userspace. They could (and probably do) load the Wine libraries here without interfering with the Windows process. It also means that it would be very difficult to implement Wine's complement, a way of running Linux binaries on Windows.",1233086199

I realize that Balsamiq is a sweet-heart for many HN readers, but come on, that shouldn't stop us from welcoming a competitor. I liked the Iplotz app. They have a very polished look and I really like their full-screen mode which lets me work without distractions. Their sharing feature is definitely a good one when working with multiple people, (definitely beats emailing files back and forth). I especially liked the controls on the left rather than the top. The properties box for the UI control was very intrusive, I don't want a solid box blocking my wireframe. I like the task manager that is built into the app, which is useful when sharing tasks with your team members, especially when collaborating with someone remotely.",1233085974

At my school, the email system was getting overwhelmed with mass emails from students selling stuff, looking for rides, trying to find items. There was already a site created by a student to sell things, look for rides, and post lost items, but nobody used it. Now they have just cut off access to mass email for nearly everyone, and the adoption of the site has gone up somewhat. So I would suggest that you first start with managers, trying to get them to only accept some things from the wiki, and consider cutting off some mass email access if it is being used for things that you want to move to the wiki. You will upset some people, but you will get them using the wiki.",1233085723

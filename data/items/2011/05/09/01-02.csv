This lets you set a long cache header, or at least to serve it from cached memory. Even if you don't outsource your comments, I bet caching the page for 2-3 minutes in memory would solve most of your problems.<p>Also, cache headers on your other assets wouldn't hurt.

They have no pro-activity, no problem solving ability.<p>But is that an accurate picture of Indian culture?  Could they have modernised their agriculture, fought 3+ major wars, launched satellites into space and developed a nuclear program if they were all like the off-shore programmers?  They'd have starved to death and/or been wiped out by their own incompetence if that was the case.<p>Clearly, the Indian Engineers of 2011 are a 'different breed' than their counter-parts in the 60s and 70s.<p><i>Something must have happened</i>.<p>If you accept that premise, that things have gone downhill in a big way, then it begs the question ""why?"".

America got big and strong by two things: (a) enormous mineral wealth, (b) opening its borders to immigrants.  Having avoided most of the draining effect of the European wars in the 1800s and 1900s helped, and also served to promote the view of America as a safe haven.<p>If you forget that immigration isn't just about ""dumb people who are browner than me"" and also includes ""the intellectual elite of countries like Austria fleeing wars and persecution"" then you start thinking that immigration is all about ""they took aor jaorbs!"", and close down your borders, impose quotas... and the stagnation begins.",1304906018

When you write documents to Lucene they are written to a segments file, usually one for each batch of documents you write.  When searching, each of the segments files are searched for terms, so the more segments files you have, the slower the search tends to be.  When segments files reach a certain size they are automatically compacted into other segments files.

Closer to the programming realm, any theoretical computer scientist will lament the huge delay between theory and practice - does this mean they don't have a valid complaint, simply because they aren't fixing <i>everything</i>?<p>Specific to the piece:<p>><i>Chomsky derided researchers in machine learning who use purely statistical methods to produce behavior that mimics something in the world, but who don't try to understand the meaning of that behavior. Chomsky compared such researchers to scientists who might study the dance made by a bee returning to the hive, and who could produce a statistically based simulation of such a dance without attempting to understand why the bee behaved that way.</i><p>A valid complaint from a researcher, I think, and Chomsky has hardly ""not produced anything of value"".  The first round of AI work in the 60s and 70s was a lot of theoretical work getting, as you mentioned, the low-hanging fruit in a new field.  And then it turned out to be harder than the initial extreme success implied, and took more computational power.  In more recent years, there have been business reasons to use relatively simple AI models to do fairly basic tasks - predicting your tastes in movies, for example.

The length of the program represents the complexity (which measures the choices that form the program). There's different formulations of a turing machine (different languages for programming one), but since any turing machine can be simulated by any other turing machine with a program, the length of that program becomes the error (that represents the difference in complexity introduced by your selection of some specific Turing machine). If you are comparing models using the same turing machine, then this constant difference doesn't matter. a-b = (a+x) - (b+x)<p>One practical solution is that more data swamps minor differences between the specification language used to describe models.

As it turns out, Facebook and Twitter have, quite literally, killed RSS within the scope of their own systems by removing it from key locations.<p>In my view, RSS was never the right tool for this application anyway. Social networks are naturally conversational in nature, but you're only a part of the conversation while you're there.<p>In the economy of my attention, both Facebook and Twitter occupy a different position than the RSS feeds I follow. Facebook and Twitter are there for when I want them, but my RSS feed is the kind of thing where I try to at least review every headline. I don't want to miss anything in my RSS reader, but I'm perfectly content to miss out on large portions of what occurs on Facebook and Twitter.<p>Twitter is probably closer in function to RSS -- for me, anyway -- than Facebook, in that I rely on it for ""pushed"" information that I rarely respond to (think service outages and status updates). This could, theoretically, have been fulfilled by RSS, but for some reason, I never made use of RSS that way.<p>I think one of the reasons for this (Twitter as a popular info-push medium) is that you <i>can</i> respond easily through Twitter, even if I only do it on rare occasions. Status blogs provided an avenue for response, but you often had to have an account on every blog... Ugh. Twitter is also great because you don't have to dig through the service website; you simply search Twitter for their company name and follow.<p>Facebook, on the other hand, is purely entertainment for me. I use it to keep up with friends and converse in a time-shifted manner. I cannot imagine collecting RSS feeds from Facebook streams.<p>Based my usage patterns, I don't see this as ""killing"" RSS for me in a general sense. Maybe I'm a dying breed though.",1304903965

318720,comment,317855,317888,0,0,hugh,,,"<i>I'm still not convinced that you can't just say that x/0 equals infinity.</i><p>Certainly, there's nothing to stop you from <i>saying</i> that. We could quite easily define a number called Infinity (or, say, Frank) such that x/0 = Frank, the same way we defined a number i such that sqrt(-1) = i. People have thought about this for centuries, I'm sure, but the reason that it hasn't taken off the way i has is that positing the existence of ""i"" gets you a whole lot of new and useful mathematics (e.g. a new field of complex numbers which is closed under arbitrary roots) whereas positing the existence of Frank doesn't buy you much except trouble.<p>For instance, consider our new number system consisting of the reals plus Frank. We'll have to define operations on Frank now. Clearly, Frank + Frank = Frank and Frank * Frank = Frank. But what about Frank - Frank and Frank/Frank? You can't define them as 0 and 1 respectively, or else you find yourself with proofs like this:<p>Frank = Frank + Frank<p>Frank/Frank = Frank/Frank + Frank/Frank<p>1 = 2<p>which is undesirable. So you've <i>still</i> got undefined numbers in your number system, and your number system no longer has lots of the nice properties that you get when you have a field.<p>Also, Frank doesn't share all that many of the properties that are usually associated with what we now know about infinities -- e.g. the idea that there are ""different sizes"" of infinite sets which can't be mapped onto one another.",1222717448

However, the Mth number is different to R in its Mth digit.<p>About the limit in the infinite... it doesn't matter at all... You can't take a M value that's infinite, as we have only numbers that have a finite size (there are infinite numbers with finite size, that's the trick on this; there aren't integers with an infinite size for example). And if you take an M that's finite, then you have to say that such Mth element is different to my R.<p>And so on for any sequence you can build (even for sequences you can't build, like random sequences).<p>Edit: possibly the big thing that's confusing you is that you can't have an infinite number, even if there are infinite numbers. So, taking the limit of a function is something that has a very restrict meaning that is actually not directly related to the concept of infinity. If you check the definition of limit it doesn't talk about infinities but about deltas, and if you use such definition your proposed problem stops being a problem. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_</a>(mathematics)#Formal_definition",1222716575

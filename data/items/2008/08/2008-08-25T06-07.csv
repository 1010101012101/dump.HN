285742,comment,285600,285714,0,0,DaniFong,,,"No, don't apologize, this viewpoint is absolutely intriguing, and I greatly appreciate the discussion. The goal is to make the best tab navigation system, not to trumpet any particular design :-)<p>I especially like your point about identifying tabs with state, and identifying tabs that are basically applications. Perhaps we can actually accomplish much of this automatically? We can at least detect the presence of things entered into text-fields. We can at least save a state of the DOM and Javascript namespace instead of wiping everything else out.<p>If a tab is an application, it perhaps doesn't make sense to bind it to the same horizontal time axis; perhaps instead to do as OS X does, by loading applications into a doc. On the other hand, though, on OS X I just navigate around with Quicksilver, which has a quasimodal 'task-leaping' behavior that's totally supported by this version of FoxGlide.<p>It's certainly true that it's unclear which time variables are the most important to display. At the moment, I suggest a hybrid approach -- organize the tabs horizontally by order of opening, as is the default in Firefox. At the same time, indicate on the activity ticker, for each time, which tab you have opened, and what you were doing. This keep the horizontal ordering of tabs static, aiding spatial memory, while allowing you to recall what you were doing at any given moment, using the activity ticker.<p>Regarding the distinction between open and closed tabs, I think that most of the population likes the feeling of 'finality' achieved once they close a tab. They like knowing that they could recover it, if need be, but mostly, they appreciate tabs being ""out of sight, out of mind"". It's always going to be important to be able to close tabs (for stopping persistent behavior: eg. Meebo, Pandora, Youtube).<p>I guess you would advocate the graying out of closed tabs, while perhaps lowering their priority more rapidly. Is this correct?<p>Is it possible that the gutter can be adapted for your needs as well? Say, it only shows up if you actually close something. We need to strike some compromise between people who want closed tabs <i>out of their face</i> and people who want tabs <i>around</i>, like you.",1219647443

285735,comment,285399,285399,0,0,siculars,,,"/rant<p>There can be no doubt that Russia has many, many brilliant mathematicians and engineers (poets, writers and musicians too). Everyone knows this. And, individually, I know their people can be quite lovely. The problem is that these people are in Russia. Russia crushes all. How many times do people have to get burned by Russia to realize Russia is a trade - not an investment? How long before the wannabe czar declares ""all your routers/servers/data/money/life are belong to us""? ""Russians"", by and large, are not affluent. A relative handful of Moscowvites are.<p>Mark Franchetti is obviously on the payroll but why he would write this blatant puff piece about ""yet another indexer"" is beyond me. These people have nothing Google, Yahoo and even Microsoft can and have put together. The only thing they do have is an advantage in the understanding of native Russian language and society. Ok, so? There is no market for Russian services outside of Russia. The rest of the world speaks English, French, Spanish, Arabic or some version of Chinese with a smattering of Portuguese thrown in for good measure.<p>Since the Empire struck back in Georgia, international monetary outflows from Russia have been at their highest levels since the Great Ruble Implosion of the late 1990's. Lets face it gang, when the big ugly bear flexes its muscles people run for cover. Nobody wants to be in bed with his highness, the dread nightmare Putin. Who here thinks Putin has his peoples best interest at heart? Who here thinks a goal of Russia is to increase the prosperity of its people? Putin is out for numero uno, Putin. And the main concern for Putin is Gazprom. Who here thinks that Yandex will continue to fly under the radar of the FSB indefinitely? Who here thinks an independent, privately owned and operated company can exist in Russia without connections to their political/military/underworld/secret police?<p>(off topic)
People in the West love to bitch and moan about the US all day long. 'Hegemony', 'Imperialism', 'Totalitarianism' and, lest we forget, torture. Has everyone fallen asleep at the wheel? If you are from the West and do not have an ancestral connection to mother Russia, you have no idea what any of those words mean. It will be many generations (hopefully that short) before Russia is friendly enough as a national entity to do anything even related to business with.<p>In closing, if this Yandex knows whats good for them they will pull up stakes, run dont walk and leave Russia with extreme haste and plop themselves down anywhere else. London, Paris, Silicon Valley, New York, Madrid. Pick one, any of a dozen or more cities would be better than the dump that we know today as Russia.<p>Oh, in the fairness of full disclosure, if it sounds like I am anti-Russia in the extreme, I am. Honestly, which Olympic medalist of any color has defected from the West to Russia? We here in America have Russia to thank for our brand new Olympic individual gymnastic all-around Champion, Nastia Luikin :)<p>/end rant",1219646720

285714,comment,285600,285681,0,0,ivank,,,"I like some parts of it (like how it detects typing activity), but I think it adds more visual complexity than needed. The temporal information <i>might</i> cause confusion: what if almost all the pages in tab were accessed 14 hours ago, but then you clicked a link in it and went back? what time would you show? There's just so many time variables that I don't know which would be useful. In either case, I would prefer a more subtle approach to showing age, like fading tab color.<p>I think tabs have been broken from the beginning, though. My goal is to traverse information as rapidly as possible, tagging things I like (today I do this by manually with Save Page As). I simply visit too many pages to know if a tab/page is a true ""task"" or not; this is why I don't see the purpose of distinguishing between currently open tabs and history. And this is why the gutter bothers me: why distinguish between what's open and what's closed (but is still useful)?<p>I realize many people use just four or five browser tabs, but that kind of workflow is more suitable to the OS taskbar itself. Often times, half these tabs are a stateful application like gmail and the purpose of the tab is to separate workflows. Automatically identifying tabs with stateful activity is the key to this. Right now, users are doing it manually and keeping those tabs open all the time. It should be the browser's job to know what is ""important"" and what is ""just a page"". This is one of the true advantages of the iPhone (I haven't used other smartphones) - all of the built-in applications preserve state perfectly and I never have to fiddle with a separate ""app launcher"" and ""window switcher"". In Firefox, the tabs are the unnecessary ""window switcher"". Of course I'm ignoring the behavior of MobileSafari because it's a memory/space-limited device.<p>This is somewhat separate from your design, I'm just finally writing my complete rant on tabs. I realize I might be browsing the web very strangely. Sorry to thread-jack :-)",1219644277

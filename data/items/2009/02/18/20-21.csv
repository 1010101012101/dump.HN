I used their C# profiling tool a few years back, so my ears perked up a bit when I saw the author's affiliation.<p>The takeaway seems to be that if you've written your product on a platform (in their case VB6) that you can't take forward for whatever reason, then it might make sense to rewrite it.<p>Davidson freely admits that they rewrote their code for the wrong reasons -- they just couldn't think of anything else to do at the time -- but that it turned out well in the end for them.<p>Ironically, they were right about competitors nipping at their heels.

A quick perusal on my part showed this is indeed the case.<p>> Driving around the neighborhood in an old-school van sans windows with ""candy and science"" painted on the side probably isn't a good idea; but the local library, on the other hand, is. Karrine used the latter method. A couple of fliers with catchy wording on the local library's community board helped her find interested students. For the projects that they worked on, she says that six students seems to be the ideal amount, since this allows for three pair groups, each working on building the week's cool project.<p>Easily actionable bits.",1234988957

Not to mention the fore-mentioned universities, and all of the hospitals (UPMC is the region's single largest employer).

People generally don't care because the problems that are happening aren't problems for end-users; they're problems for advertisers.<p>If Google becomes the only game in town for search, their ad rates will rise simply because advertisers won't have another outlet for search advertising.  Likewise, ad rates at Yahoo are suffering today since the mindset is always to advertise on Google and the greater competition in Google's ad auctions make their pricing a lot higher.  Personally, I find it a good reason not to run ads on Google (since it's cheaper for the same thing), but if Google's dominance keeps going up, it's going to cause problems.<p>So, even if Google does nothing, by getting to a certain size (compared to the overall size of the market), it causes problems.  Of course, I'd much rather Google in that position than Microsoft <<shudder>>.<p>I don't begrudge Google either - they've acted as good corporate citizens offering a wonderful service.

486191,comment,485701,485841,0,0,speby,,,"Selling itself is a misnomer. Nothing ""sells itself."" Selling just means a combination of things you need to do communicate well to other people about what your service/product does, why it does it better than anything else, and how you're helping people solve a problem or gain some kind of entertainment or value. So selling could be in the form of a very well defined sales funnel (a la 37signals), writing/publishing content as a loss leader (a la 37signals), releasing open source content (a la 37signals), and ultimately building up a base of users/customers because you were able to get good at communicating with them. Or, even as Jason Fried has said (and I do agree) selling is almost like teaching others something. If you can teach well, you've got a shot at selling (and communicating well).<p>But yes, being able to ""press the flesh"" and meet face-to-face, do deals with large customers, sell custom contracts or whatever is also selling.

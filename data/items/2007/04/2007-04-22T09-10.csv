Maybe you should just make it a little bit clearer on the web page why you copied YCombinator, and what background experiences you have, to evoke more trust.<p>Your metalab looks interesting (wish there was something like it where I live), and I think Vienna is a great city (much better than the Valley, I suspect). I wish you success with the venture!",1177235742

But I'm guessing this is why Wikio got 12M(!) in funding?<p>To clarify, I'm definitely not calling you unskilled and am not qualified to do so. I'm attacking your copying of a question that implies you have solid experience in the field as a seed funding organization, operating like YC. I don't even know their inner workings.<p>But public funding + politics + international applicants seems to entail a lot more than seed funding + support. In another message (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15641)"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=15641)</a>
you said work permits are available if the idea is good enough. Do the politicians have a say in the selection process?<p>I think your effort is great. Lots of people will be watching; I hope things can go smoothly for you.",1177235030

15666,comment,15628,15665,0,0,Tichy,,,"Certainly the value of YCombinator is bringing interesting people together. I don't think the Valley is the only place in the world with interesting people, though.<p>YEurope doesn't look too promising, though - the cloning approach leaves a negative impression. If they are so cutting edge, surely they would have been able to come up with their own scheme.<p>Also, they don't say how they will come up with interesting speakers.",1177233480
15665,comment,15628,15628,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"What's wrong with this sentence:<p>""YCombinator Clone in Vienna, Austria launches!""<p>Hint: It's not in the first, second, third or sixth word.<p>You're missing at least 50% of the value of Y Combinator by being outside of a startup center, probably more.  Can a successful startup happen outside of the Valley?  Sure...but you're definitely hurting the chances of success by a significant degree.",1177232898

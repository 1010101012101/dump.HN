11714,comment,11687,11705,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"We're trying to decide whether or not to set up a box at our place for our initial launch or to use a remote host.  Looking at softlayer prices, it looks like things can add up pretty quickly.  What is your experience with the costs - does it make sense given the low expense of boxes and bandwidth?  Do they have a good scaling up path?",1176266784

And yeah living in the Philippines I have the advantage of lower expenses all across the board. :-)",1176266724

11710,comment,11662,11690,0,0,aston,,,"I was sorta kidding above, but to actually be real on the topic, MIT is home of the hackers, and Harvard's got the business-minded folks. I would've picked the other way around. But then the numbers mismatch (1 VC, 2 hacker schools).<p>Also, just to clarify, the running joke (never really tested) at MIT is that Harvard kids would for the most part die here.",1176266404

11707,comment,11674,11674,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"For us, the main reason for going with Angel funding is to benefit from the advice and expertise of the Angel's network - the money is not very significant.   Y combinator seems unbeatable in the level of help they give their teams.  The Angel Project seems to be missing this kind of benefit unless I'm missing something.",1176265505

11700,comment,11662,11688,0,0,zaidf,,,"Become more creative and find a way around 'em. May be you need to build a prototype good enough to get you through to one of these programs? And if none of these programs accept you, may be you need to reconsider your idea? Or may be if you still genuinely believe in the idea, go around finding a cofounder on campus who can bring with him some $$$s(trust me, they exist, their parents are usually lawyers or into real estate:) There are plenty of options...just because some are more difficult than others is no excuse to not pursue them.<p>If you are DEAD SET on building something, you WILL find a way around these problems because they are pretty small in the bigger scheme of things.

They did do lobbying, but he left that job in 1984. At the time he held this position, it was just about television. The members of NCTA did not offer internet service or telecommunications services, for the simple reason that there was no public internet yet. The cable companies were all relatively small--the consolidation that led to the small number of giant companies we have now had not happened yet.<p>The other telecom group he was involved with that does lobbying is CTIA, which is the major trade group for cellular and wireless. He was their President from 1992 to 2004. As I said, they do some lobbying. They also do a lot of testing and evaluation of devices, develop standards and certifications, administer the short code system, put on a couple major trade shows, do safety campaigns and educational programs to teach responsible wireless use (e.g., don&#x27;t text while driving), and assorted other things along those lines.<p>The regulations for wireless phone service he negotiated with the FCC in the mid &#x27;90s are similar to the Title II proposal that seems to be on the way--which is an approach that the current CTIA objects to for internet. (And note that this approach worked well for phone. All the carriers massively expanded their infrastructure, cellular voice is quite competitive, ubiquitous, and cheap).<p>Between those positions, and after the latter, he&#x27;s been involved with a bunch of companies as founder, President (or CEO or similar), or board member. These have been in a variety of areas, including aerospace component repair, investment banking, wireless providers, cloud services, and content providers. (He&#x27;s also was on the PBS board, and was a trustee of the Kennedy Center, and wrote a couple history books on the civil war--he seems to have very wide interests).<p>Taken as a whole, he&#x27;s been involved heavily in organizations or companies that have reason to be on pretty much every side of any telecom issue, so if he does have some prejudice toward any past employer there is no reason to believe it would be toward ISPs. His actions certainly don&#x27;t show signs of pro-ISP prejudice, considering that most of his proposals have pissed them off.",1421484569

8903897,comment,8902071,8903016,0,0,zo1,,,"I see you and the OP liked that feature of math problems in the textbooks. I, however, disliked them completely. Here&#x27;s why:<p>The format is usually on of: you have a chapter with explanation, samples, and rules. Fine and dandy, and then you get to the end of the chapter with a bunch of questions. The questions, usually, start off with simple, menial ones that test your knowledge of the chapter. These are <i>not</i> challenging in any way, they&#x27;re just gatekeepers to make sure you memorized and can apply what was taught in the chapter.<p>And then, they completely flip it around and make the questions completely <i>different</i> and non-standard. They throw you into the deep end for no reason, without any progression. I wouldn&#x27;t mind them twisting and slowly warping the questions with more complicated constructs that add new/unique elements, but they hardly ever did that. They instead just threw them all, haphazardly, into the &quot;difficult&quot; questions.<p>Again, I wouldn&#x27;t mind that if I had <i>some</i> place to look for the answers in that book. Perhaps in an earlier chapter, which would mean that the &quot;hard&quot; problems in subsequent chapters would try combine the concept in the recent chapter with things learnt in <i>older</i> chapters.<p>Sometimes, I really think they don&#x27;t always spend as much time on those practice/bonus questions as much as they should. We&#x27;d very easily get out of the whole &quot;memorize + apply&quot; rut of education, and into &quot;learn, apply and extrapolate&quot;, which is where real intelligence/knowledge is.",1421484277

School, school, school...<p>First I had to learn to program, but that wouldn't be enough. Companies want university degrees -- no one hires a relatively smart kid and trains them anymore -- and I lacked the money for university, so I would have to get into IT or a specialized field.<p>The web was getting big but the early 2000s bubble had burst by the time I had a solid understanding of the LAMP stack, so with no experience I was competing with people who had been doing professional web dev for years. That meant no work, so back to school.<p>Jobs were opening up in IT, so I studied network administration. Potential offers went sour because I didn't know Office, so I kept at school for that. Around that time HP laid off 2,000 engineers, many of whom were experienced IT people. After that, it was difficult to find any ads for IT work in the area.<p>I secured a 3-year unpaid internship where I worked with GIS, but every GIS job requires a university Geography degree or more prior experience than I have.<p>There were usually a few jobs open for Autocad users, so I took Autocad courses.

2586593,comment,2585750,2585750,8,0,gruseom,,,"Forth is metaprogrammable machine language in the way that Lisp is metaprogrammable expressions. Each is a local optimum of programming languages, meaning that any other language that tries to do the same thing ends up being either isomorphic to it or not as powerful. In other words, a version of PG's thesis about Lisp holds equally for Forth in its neighborhood.<p>But Forth has one major advantage over all other such languages: it's a generalization of the hardware.<p>Every metaprogrammable language other than Forth is a generalization of some abstract primitive (s-exprs for Lisp, objects for Smalltalk), which leaves a gap at the bottom that must be bridged before anything can be executed. These languages all struggle to get to the machine. Consider the decades it took to make Lisp fast. In Forth, the primitive <i>is</i> the machine. This is so extraordinary a position to occupy -- full metaprogramming all the way up from binary -- that I wonder why we don't see more amazing things done with Forth. Of course, majority practice is not correlated with computing greatness.<p>I think this extraordinary quality of Forth is connected to how Forth grew out of a working programmer's projects. Lisp came from math, Smalltalk from language research. It's worth remembering that Moore learned Lisp from McCarthy before he invented Forth. Forth is a Lisp hacker's attempt to make something he could use in commercial projects on mid-60s hardware.",1306384001

2586582,comment,2586226,2586226,2,0,ggchappell,,,"This is a clean, well written demonstration of how convenient it is to create new types with overloaded math operators in Python. Devotees of C++, in particular, really need to see how nice it can be when operators and inheritance Just Work.<p>But I got a twinge of irritation near the beginning of the article. Call it a pet peeve if you want, but it's ridiculous to say that Python is ""untyped"". On the contrary, Python's typing can be quite unforgiving, never letting you weasel out of a type error with arbitrary conversions (a la C or C++).<p>It <i>is</i> true that implicit, dynamic, duck-by-default typing (like Python) looks at first glance quite similar to no typing at all (like ANSI Forth). This is particularly true if one is used to languages like C or (as he mentions) Pascal.<p>But this is only true at first glance. What is really going on here is that, since Pascal came out, the language-design community has figured out how to put together type systems that mostly stay out of the programmer's way, while still being strong enough to provide useful safety guarantees. (See also Haskell, etc.)<p>And this, I think, is a terribly nifty thing that should not be glossed over.",1306383304

2586579,comment,2585962,2586171,4,0,kstenerud,,,"Pope Urban VIII's beef with Cassini wasn't over his assertion that Copernicus was right, but rather because Cassini was asserting that which he could not prove. He was basically saying that he was right and everyone else was wrong and they should just believe him because he was right.<p>The pope said (rightly so) that unless Cassini could offer proof as to the cause of planets allegedly circling the sun, he should present both the Copernicus and Ptolemy model and leave it up to the reader to make up his mind. (He couldn't prove it because the theory of gravitation was not known at the time)<p>Instead, Galileo tricked a priest into printing his book without a papal seal of approval, after he had promised the pope that he would present the Copernicus model as a hypothesis and not as proven fact.<p>So, in this case, the church was on the side of the scientific method.

First of all, the ONLY language I am aware of that provides guarantees on immutability is Haskell, as it is the only language I am know of that has any kind of serious effects system. I'm sure there are others (Clean might be one of them), but they certainly aren't in common use. That means that you must also not like Scheme/Racket, Clojure, CL, or the ML's, and you must not consider them to have killer FP value either.<p>Second of all, Scala isn't kinda OO kinda-sorta functional. Scala is actually more OO than Java, C#, C++, and any other statically typed language that I can think of off the top of my head.  At the same time, Scala integrates functional concepts and techniques like higher order functions, immutability, and pattern matching into this object system in a very clean and effective way. In short, Scala has accomplished the most beautiful fusion of OO and functional that I have ever seen.<p>As someone who has used several functional and OO languages, I can witness that Scala is doing something very special and is not worthy of the criticisms you give it, whether or not you like Mirah more, and I am certainly a fan of Charles Nutter's work.",1306382837

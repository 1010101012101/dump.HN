When I was working at a major telecommunications firm, our C++ coding manual dated back to 1985--any features that weren't stable in C++ as of '85 simply could not be used in modern code in '99.<p>Large scale engineering shops are very, very slow to change.  Right there's one major reason why C++ hasn't caught on in the OS level.<p>The other major reason has to do with the way C++ implements inheritance.  The fragile base class problem is a killer for OS level design.  If you want to dodge that, then your best bet is to write your kernel in the C subset of C++ and eschew C++'s object model.<p>Finally, there's the issue of portability.  C++ didn't even standardize until 1998.  Compilers lagged substantially behind the Standard until about 2003.  Using sophisticated C++ features like the STL tended to lock you into one particular compiler vendor.  That's not something an OS designer especially wants.<p>I know of several engineering shops that write their code in C, precisely to get around vendor quality-of-implementation issues in their C++ compilers.  However, despite the fact they write their code in C, they make compiling it with a C++ compiler part of their software engineering practice, in order to take advantage of the C++'s compiler's much stronger type checking.<p>I have yet to see the tool chain be an issue in C++ development.  That's not to say it can't be an issue or that you haven't seen it--only to say I've never seen it become a substantial issue.",1207381941

Buses are an obvious next step, but making a driverless car is the relatively easy <i>first</i> step.<p>If we don&#x27;t get started on the first step, we&#x27;ll never solve the second, or the third or the thirtieth.<p>He complains that Manhattan would be better if it was pedestrianised... really?  Does he think that they&#x27;re going to knock down buildings and remove the roads just so we can all have a chat in the street?  And has he ever been on mass transit like trains or subways?  I dunno about the rest of the world, but I can guarantee there&#x27;s almost no &quot;valuable, often spontaneous social interaction&quot; going on in London.  You sit/stand quietly, generally in some discomfort due to overcrowding or tiny seats, maybe talk to a friend (if there) but probably not.  They&#x27;re anything <i>but</i> sociable.<p>There&#x27;s always some complaint that you can raise about any future technology project, but sometimes you just have to get it done using what you have.  Those dense pedestrian friendly cities in Europe didn&#x27;t get that way by design, they just couldn&#x27;t be knocked down to expand the roads for cars, so they made do with narrow roads.  Likewise, US car friendly cities aren&#x27;t going anywhere, deal with what you&#x27;ve got.<p>On another note, he seems to be ignoring the growing trend in renewable power sources around the world.  There is a big push in Europe to switch to cleaner energy sources, thus making electric cars a great idea.  eg. Combine the solar panels of the Tesla charging stations with automated cars that can drive in and charge while you&#x27;re at work and you&#x27;ve got a revolution in how we get around.<p>Not to mention that there are countries like France that have 75% nuclear power, thus making the electric car almost emission-free from the very start.",1401656219

What you&#x27;re describing isn&#x27;t so much an alternative as it is a wistful dream of a completely re-engineered human condition. And I say this as someone who loves to bike, has high hopes for future public transportation changes, and believes that we&#x27;ll come to see many of the changes you&#x27;re alluding to trickle into the world. Even then, the sort of revolution you&#x27;re describing wouldn&#x27;t be one that simply swaps out the car, but one that would necessitate changing everything from cities to suburbs to everything in between. Cities don&#x27;t change overnight; they change over decades.<p>The implications of self-driving cars go well beyond simply cars &quot;twirling the steering wheel themselves.&quot; From huge boosts in efficiency, to decreases in city congestion as people abandon the always exciting practice of circling the block for a parking space, to better traffic flow and decreases in traffic accidents to almost nil, self-driving cars are going to be revolutionary in ways that many can&#x27;t even imagine.<p>What&#x27;s more is that they won&#x27;t be limited to just private vehicles. Autonomous taxis will combine door-to-door service with the Zipcar sharing model together and turn the current system on its head. The same goes for buses and even subways and trains, where the ability to run unimpeded 24/7 will make mass transit options that much more flexible and easier to expand. All of this while minimizing congestion on the roads.",1401656145

That cult tells students that it&#x27;s not worth doing math unless you&#x27;re the best at math—because those special few are the only ones whose contributions really count. We don&#x27;t treat any other subject that way. I&#x27;ve never heard a student say, &quot;I like &#x27;Hamlet,&#x27; but I don&#x27;t really belong in AP English—that child who sits in the front row knows half the plays by heart, and he started reading Shakespeare when he was 7!&quot; Basketball players don&#x27;t quit just because one of their teammates outshines them. But I see promising young mathematicians quit every year because someone in their range of vision is &quot;ahead&quot; of them.<p>Being identified as a child genius puts you into the unfortunate default circumstance of always competing with everybody, instead of just competing with yourself like you are supposed to do when learning and growing. You are <i>supposed</i> to be uniquely smart, and when other kids do something better than you you start to question yourself.<p>Importantly, well meaning educators try to foster the areas you test as exceptionally gifted in, when what they should be doing is teaching you how to work through and overcome areas you are weaker in -- to achieve a better cognitive balance. This can help the child break the &quot;curse of being gifted&quot;, where effortless achievement in one area becomes a kind of short-loop positive feedback drug they focus all of their attention on and harder/less obvious areas are ignored much to later detriment.<p>But it&#x27;s almost never done, because it&#x27;s assumed that since you&#x27;re gifted in one area you&#x27;re gifted in them all and they&#x27;ll just focus on the ones you test the highest in. You&#x27;ve been given a magical spark, and they want to capture that spark. The cruel irony is that quite often, the harder they work to grab it, the faster it goes away.<p>I think one of the problems is that many of the educators responsible for guiding exceptionally gifted children through all this were not themselves exceptionally gifted and have a poor understanding and empathy for what it&#x27;s like to walk around with all this, often <i>very uneven</i>, nascent intelligence.<p>I see from many of the comments here that other really bright kids were put in competitive environments where scores and placements became a big focus of their lives: SAT scores, Putnam, IQ scores...I&#x27;m sure most of us also did state or regional competitions of some sort or another. The most important thing I learned from all that when I was going through it was that &quot;there&#x27;s <i>always</i> somebody better than you so don&#x27;t get all emotional when you have the bad fortune to cross paths with them in the same competition.&quot;<p>Actually, the better lesson I learned was to not bother competing at all and just focus one challenging myself. I&#x27;m already in the top 1-2% in whatever narrow subject area according to some test, without any effort, why don&#x27;t I achieve competency in something I outright suck at? If I&#x27;m so smart, I should be able to figure out how to attack and surmount any weakness I have.<p>I think that little philosophy has gotten me much farther than any of the areas I was identified as being gifted in as a child.",1401656026

It&#x27;s that they perpetuate the isolationism that&#x27;s deeply embedded in American culture.<p>My parents grew up in Bangladesh, my mom in a fairly large city and my dad in a village. When they moved to the suburbs of D.C., the biggest culture shock they encountered was the intense isolation of American suburban life. Even in rural Bangladesh, you&#x27;ll encounter dozens of people in a typical day. But in the U.S., you have to go out of your way (i.e. drive) to see other people. You can go days without seeing anyone outside your immediate family unit.<p>Self-driving cars address certain problems with a car-based society, like congestion and safety, but they perpetuate the model of driving around in little steel bubbles where we don&#x27;t interact with or even see other people.

We use a write filter to avoid writes to OS partition (writes redirect changes to memory) so it is mostly readonly but it still can fail and and when it does the system is unrecoverable.  Other partitions may still be seemingly okay but we just replace once a failure is spotted.  Disk based drives usually don&#x27;t fail as catastrophically in my experience but do have more errors.<p>Having said that we have been using them for past 5 years and only have had a dozen failures in that time over probably 500 deployments.

If you have worked on a production web site with meaningful traffic and customers, know at least 3 programming languages and are comfortable writing unit tests then we want to talk to you.<p>Are you opinionated and diplomatic? Most people are one or the other. All major decisions are made democratically, and we do code reviews on every pull request to keep quality high. You need to be able to express your opinions in as objective a manner as possible, and be able to accept and learn from constructive criticism. There&#x27;s always a better way to do something.<p>Are you working on personal projects / your own startup? You&#x27;ll need to be a self-starter to get on at Rainforest, because we&#x27;ll give you a lot of freedom and almost no hand-holding.<p>DESIGNERS WHO CODE<p>Design is at the heart of everything we do. We fundamentally believe that great design - meaning usability, simplicity and elegance - is core to our competitive advantage, and one of the most important ways we can work toward our mission of making developers happier and more productive.<p>We are proponents of noPSD design (so much so that we wrote a blog post about our process). To that end you should at the very least be comfortable with mocking up your designs in HTML and CSS, and ideally be able to own the entire front-end process of shipping a new feature, from conception through user research, to design and build, and iterating based on usage metrics and qualitative feedback.<p>We know we&#x27;re looking for a unicorn, so if you feel like you&#x27;re an excellent front-end hacker whose design chops are a bit rusty you should still get in touch. Design is all about iteration, and we already have a great designer on our team who can help you grow as a designer.<p>DEV OPS<p>We&#x27;re looking for an exceptional DevOps engineer to join as the next member of Rainforest. We&#x27;re still a very small team, but people usually think we&#x27;re much bigger given the scale at which we operate.<p>One of the more technically complex parts of our infrastructure is managing a large stack of virtual machines. Every single test run through Rainforest is done through a newly minted VM. This means that we boot thousands of machines every single day. Given our current growth, we expect this to grow exponentially.<p>Here&#x27;s what we hope to get out of you: You&#x27;re not afraid of writing code, our stack is Ruby, so you&#x27;ll have to either know it or be ready to learn it. You need to have prior experience with a provisioning tool (Puppet, Chef, etc). You understand systems and networks thoroughly. You know things we don&#x27;t about distributed systems.<p>We&#x27;re working on super hard problems that make developers&#x27; lives easier. We are a group of friends that love what we&#x27;re working on, and believe that we&#x27;re going to change the world for people building software.<p>DATA NERD<p>We run a lot of tests here at Rainforest. We record everything that testers do to execute each test. Clicks, text entry, submission times, answers, screenshots… everything. Alongside that, we have fine-grained metrics on our testers, where they are from, what time they log into the system, how often they test with Rainforest. That&#x27;s a lot of data and we could do so much more with it.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone to help us do that. Your role will be to use this data to improve the quality of the results we return to our customers, detect fraud, resolve disputes, generate tests automatically and many many other things.<p>We&#x27;re looking for someone with a strong background in data science, statistics and supervised learning. You&#x27;ll also need to be able to write code to productize your work. Most importantly, you should be able to own your projects and see them through to improving the lives of our customers. This role would probably be perfect for academics who want to get into a small team that moves fast and ships software every day.<p>Apply via our website! <a href=""https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rainforestqa.com/jobs/</a>",1401654685

My first programming experiences were on the Apple IIe, and it was much more similar to Windows than to vi or Emacs, and I don&#x27;t believe my ability to edit files was particularly harmed by not using these editors.<p>Moreover, although I use vi on occasion (because it&#x27;s ubiquitously installed and readily accessible in a terminal) I don&#x27;t like it at all. It fails almost totally on the level of <i>discoverability</i>. That is, those wonderfully composable commands are impossible to discover in vi itself. It also fails at the level of giving good feedback about what you&#x27;re doing right now. Finally, it fails because it&#x27;s confusing because modal editing is confusing. It makes much more sense to me to use &quot;out of band&quot; input (like meta keys and mouse input) which is psychologically orthogonal to actually entering text. Not to mention the fact that in situations where you want to move and edit a lot, you actually add a LOT of keystrokes.<p>I agree that composability is a very cool feature of vi, but the negatives dominate this. (This is the reverse argument that people seem to ignore about javascript: the ubiquity and power of js absolutely dominates, by several orders of magnitude, it&#x27;s weaknesses as a language and runtime.)<p>In any event, arguing about text editors truly is like religious argument: if you enjoy using emacs, vi, or notepad, I&#x27;m happy for you! In the end, if it works for you then it&#x27;s good, and it seems rather counter-productive to try to convince people one way or another.",1401653526

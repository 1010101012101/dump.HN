There is no cosmetic or usability difference between a secure application and a nightmare that leads to thousands of leaked passwords.

On the other hand, I don't really see the damage done to the photographer so many years after taking the picture.<p>However, my first thought was ""that's the Kind of Blue cover"" not ""that's the famous photo of Miles Davis"".

It seems like people think that such ""engineering"" mistakes are acceptable in the software/web industry. But let me ask you: What if a construction engineer made a little mistake (humans err right?) when building that bridge? Maybe nothing happens but believe me he will get sued and no one here would object.<p>Sure, in the latter example people could get killed, but a big security error with Dropbox could also lead to serious personal damage (personal health documents published, business confidentiality breached, etc, etc).<p>It seems like people don't understand that building a ""structure"" in the software world should be the same as building a ""structure"" in the real world. Would you not sue the safe company that produced a safe that just opened by itself the day you were robbed (leading to theft of personal important documents, money, jewelry). Would you not sue the produced of an over-heating oven that leads to your house burning down?<p>Why do people assume that it is acceptable to make mistakes in the software world, but not in the ""physical"" world? Maybe this points towards some kind of basic problem with the software/web business model. Maybe all these free/premium product are really too cheap (and can be so cheap because they are inadequately produced). Maybe we need to accept that these ship-quickly products are not really acceptable, that there really needs to be considerable investment into such products (and thus increasing prices)...<p>Note: I do understand that nobody would accept a 50/50 % chance-of-breaking bridge, but may very well accept a 50/50 % chance-of-being-breached ""Dropbox"".

PCBSD is relatively new, rough around the edges, and is perhaps the most important thing for the healthy future of FreeBSD.  It gets people exposed to the OS.  If I have used Linux before and I am going to set up a server I am much more likely to pick Linux for that server than I am FreeBSD.<p>Second strong corporate support,  IBM and several other big corporations are behind Linux development and help get it in to the field.  FreeBSD doesn't have a large IT services company installing Linux on servers as a part of their consulting business.",1309268370

And did that constitute negligence?<p>From what little I know I'd say the answer is <i>yes</i> on all counts. But I'll concede that reasonable people might disagree, especially after a detailed investigation. Fortunately we have a mechanism for adjudicating significant disputes among reasonable people by conducting detailed investigations: It's called a court.<p>Now, what I don't know is: Do these events rise to the level where a legal remedy is called for? How big should the remedy be? And are Dropbox's terms of service, which every customer presumably clicked through at some point, going to protect them from being held liable for negligence? Heck if I know. I'm not a lawyer. Fortunately, lawyers <i>are</i> lawyers.<p>I can't understand why you've picked this particular case to freak out about. Why are you so alarmed to see a company <i>which was, by all appearances, negligent and in breach of contract</i> getting sued for negligence and breach of contract? What kind of surprise is this? It's like water flowing downhill. If a company ""accidentally"" appears to break a contract, the company has to explain itself. If it ""accidentally"" breaks the law, it gets taken to court to plead its case. And if it is found to have ""accidentally"" committed negligence, it gets held liable.<p>Yes, I know that it seems like an understandable mistake that could happen to any engineer. I feel for those folks. But this is the big leagues, and excuses are not what engineering is about. Engineering is about anticipating mistakes and designing safeguards, and when real engineers (as opposed to fake ""software engineers"" like myself) screw up a project badly enough a negligence suit is often the least of their problems. They lose licenses and sometimes even go to prison.<p>Fortunately, nobody appears to have been seriously injured and perhaps nobody will even lose their job. A corporation has been sued, and maybe it will pay. In the meantime, it will re-prioritize its backlog to include better automated testing. ;) This happens. Don't take it so personally.

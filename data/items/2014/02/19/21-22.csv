Science does actually work.<p>As to a different approach that rejects authority ... What would that look like? Would we not value expertise anymore? Would there be no expertise anymore? I like being allowed to get good at something by putting in effort ... and once I do I&#x27;m going to be right about the subject more often than those who haven&#x27;t put in effort. And people will notice that and listen to me, they will value my opinion more than others.<p>I&#x27;m pretty lost as to how this dynamic could be broken in a non-nightmarish way.",1392847178

7266552,comment,7265540,7266364,13,0,pyoung,,,"There are some complications to the implementation of this system.  If you choose to incentivize the Realtor to stay below a specific budget, the Realtor might start steering you to cheaper units (re: smaller,  shabbier, poor neighborhoods) in order to get a bigger commission.  If you base the commission on the discount negotiated off the list price of a home, you may push the Realtor into low balling offers and not closing deals (not to mention, in many markets, homes sell for over list price).<p>Probably the best method would be too use a flat fee, or a percentage of list, and then add bonus commissions for performance in negotiations, using the average &#x27;over/under asking price&#x27; in the local market as an index.  But this is probably too complicated for most people, and at the end of the day, the Realtor is more concerned about the volume of deals they can close rather than the individual deals, so performance based commissions will still probably have minimal impact on behavior.",1392847165

It is typical for a European city like Stockholm or London for 40-60% of the people in a metro area to live in the denser, core city. In the U.S., that number is more typically 10-20%. Moreover, because of historical reasons, the dense inner cities in the U.S. that are most geographically amenable to building out fiber have huge proportions of poor people who couldn&#x27;t afford it. Middle class people who might buy fiber are disproportionately more likely to live out in suburban areas less suitable for building such infrastructure.<p>Very concrete example: Delaware is one of the fastest states in the U.S., with average connection speeds in Akamai&#x27;s study comparable to the top 5 countries in the global list.

The main character of that book is mechanically inclined.  But are you?  Could you, for instance, explain how a simple mechanical device like a differential works?  Probably not.  Therefore in some sense you fail to be the kind of person that Prisig was describing.  Not because you lack interest, but because your interest is in a different area.<p>(BTW if you&#x27;re curious, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYAw79386WI</a> has an excellent explanation of how a differential works.)<p>When you start doing this, you may find something interesting.  You&#x27;ll notice that people like tptacek, whose actual skills should properly impress you, have great respect for people like patio11.  Why?  Because tptacek recognizes what patio11 is better at than he is, and can respect patio11 for that, at the same time as patio11 is very clear on what he is and isn&#x27;t good at.<p>So what is patio11 good at?  It is very simple.  He&#x27;s good at figuring out how tech people can market themselves.  This may not be a skill you care about.  Not one you wish to learn.  But one that tptacek sees value in.<p>And that is how life goes.  We each specialize.  Some things we choose to learn.  Other things we need to know who is good so we can know who to go to to do it.  And the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts.<p>Just make the transition from looking down on people who choose to be good at things you don&#x27;t, to accepting and respecting them for what they are.  You may be surprised at how much of your life smooths out.<p>Or you can choose to sit in your little corner, on top of your mountain of specialized knowledge, sneering at the world to make up for the fact that others don&#x27;t respect you in the way you think you deserve to be respected.

The airport from downtown, for instance, runs $11. With EcoPass it&#x27;s $2.50. We&#x27;ve found that many people would rather take the bus than drive, even if driving and parking in Denver isn&#x27;t nearly as much of an inconvenience as it is in SF. It also solves the &quot;car trouble&quot; issue for most people.<p>2: $7,500 each year for vacation - In a startup, you&#x27;re going to work harder, probably for a bit less money, than anywhere else. Burnout will happen. This is our way to combat it. We remove the obstacle of &quot;can&#x27;t afford a vacation&quot; by actually paying you to take one.<p>3: Powder Day Policy - There&#x27;s 8 inches at Vail and you can&#x27;t stand to be inside? Go. Take the day. Just don&#x27;t screw over your team and make it up in the next two weeks. The same holds true when it&#x27;s 72 and sunny for the first time in a month and you need to just get away.<p>What we found - First, the obvious. Recruiting engineering talent isn&#x27;t easy. The same can be said for just about every position that a company needs to fill, but engineering is especially difficult. By way of comparison, we have 9 positions open right now and almost 3,000 applicants. Of those, only 2 percent have applied for the engineering positions.<p>79 percent have applied as &quot;I just want to work at FullContact&quot;.<p>While that&#x27;s a drastic difference, it&#x27;s also better than what we were seeing prior to adding the &quot;non-traditional&quot; benefits as part of the recruiting/retention plan.<p>The real questions that will hit ZenPayroll (as they have us) are these - You&#x27;re going to start getting a LOT more applicants. How much time do you have to put in to filter them? Are you going to start getting a lot more GOOD applicants? How many of them just want to game the system for a year to get a taste of the good life? Are your processes good enough to weed them out?<p>As an outsider with common ground, it&#x27;s good to see even more companies taking this approach.

Also, AC voltage will probably not sustain an arc at such a low voltage, again, because it is constantly switching polarity.<p>On the other hand DC voltage, once a connection has been made, will continue to flow through that path to complete the circuit.  You can think of it as the electrons on the hot wire want very badly to get back to the place where they were generated (the source transformer under that covered up manhole).  If they find a path through your body, it will continue to flow through your blood vessels until either you or the wire burns up, or the upstream transform faults.  You basically become a fuse.  If you are part of the circuit, you&#x27;d better hope there is somebody nearby to hit you you with a pole, because otherwise you are pretty much stuck that way.  Also, DC voltage is much better at sustaining an arc, even below 100 volts, so it can set off an explosion that can ignite whatever dust is lying around the equipment.

Not the desired routine. This is why we have bad habits.<p>Good habits are hard, because they are not what we naturally tend towards doing (or we wouldn&#x27;t try to build them, we&#x27;d already have them).  Habits are self-reinforcing, and are really based off ideas of success and failure.  If we fail to (and regret our failure to) carry out our habit, that is discouraging and actually makes it harder to keep up with the habit.<p>The best way I have found to develop wanted habits is to never recognize failure in the habit.  Always recognize success.  You want to do something habitually, keep track of when you do it.  Don&#x27;t keep track in a way that lets you notice when you fail to do it.  If you want to do something daily, don&#x27;t mark on the calendar when you&#x27;ve done it, don&#x27;t write the date that you did it the last time.  Instead write down a simple tick each time you&#x27;ve done it.  Increment a counter.  Watch it go up.<p>Say you want to start to wash your brontosaurus (named Rex) on a regular basis, say you never wash him currently.  Start by washing Rex and mark a tick down.  Then the next time you think about it, wash Rex, and mark a tick down.  If you want to do it daily, the next time you think about it, consider whether you already washed him today.  If you haven&#x27;t, wash him, and put down a tick.<p>Don&#x27;t tally the ticks up.  Don&#x27;t look back to see how frequently you actually washed him every day. Don&#x27;t get frustrated because for the past three weeks you washed him daily but last week you missed him three times in a row.  When you worry about how well you are washing him, just think &quot;Did I wash him today?&quot; and then wash him if you didn&#x27;t.<p>You&#x27;ll start washing him every day.  Or you&#x27;ll start to wash him every other day and be happy with it. Or you&#x27;ll wash him from time to time.  Think about the results instead.  Do you have a brontosaurus that is sufficiently clean?  If you do that&#x27;s great, keep it up, whether you do it daily or monthly.  Do you not? Then consider what else you could do besides cleaning him yourself to make him cleaner.<p>Whatever you do, don&#x27;t just get mad at yourself for not doing it and demand from yourself that you do it more often, and then promise yourself that you will.  That won&#x27;t work.  You&#x27;ll maybe do it for a bit and then burn out from frustration and failure.<p>You can always do something like set a reminder if you don&#x27;t think about it.  But if you remember and avoid it, and then get angry with yourself for avoiding it (or rationalize your avoidance), you&#x27;re doing the opposite of what is needed to make a habit.<p>If you find you are avoiding it (Ah man, I&#x27;m too tired right now.) don&#x27;t tell yourself you will make it up tomorrow.  Don&#x27;t get angry with yourself.  Don&#x27;t even acknowledge it. It&#x27;s a habit, not a chore. It&#x27;s something you want to do more frequently, not something you have to do. Acknowledge when you do complete it, not when you don&#x27;t. As soon as you start to argue with yourself (&quot;I should do this, but I don&#x27;t want to&quot;) you&#x27;re already losing the battle. Don&#x27;t consider at that point what you should do.

From a wikipedia article:<p>&quot;Due to the sectorized arrangement of antennas on a tower, it is possible to vary the strength and angle of each sector depending on the coverage of other towers in view of the sector.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site#Channel_reuse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_site#Channel_reuse</a><p>That certainly sounds to me like a cell base station not only already has multiple antennas (which you can see with your own eyes) but that it makes use of said multiple antennas in some kind of semi-intelligent way.  Obviously not as smart as the pCell, but sorta.<p>> For a beam width of 30 degrees, you would need 12 antennas where one exists now, and you would need a way to switch between antennas on each transmitted packet to multiple served devices. That would be a nightmare.<p>As we&#x27;ve established there are already multiple antennas.  Maybe not 12, but several.  And this is a trivial problem to solve actually.  The same technology that tracks you from mast to mast can be used to track you from antenna to antenna.  This is the job of the base station controller.  Here&#x27;s a clip:<p>&quot;By using directional antennas on a base station, each pointing in different directions, it is possible to sectorise the base station so that several different cells are served from the same location. Typically these directional antennas have a beamwidth of 65 to 85 degrees. This increases the traffic capacity of the base station (each frequency can carry eight voice channels) whilst not greatly increasing the interference caused to neighboring cells (in any given direction, only a small number of frequencies are being broadcast). Typically two antennas are used per sector, at spacing of ten or more wavelengths apart. This allows the operator to overcome the effects of fading due to physical phenomena such as multipath reception. Some amplification of the received signal as it leaves the antenna is often used to preserve the balance between uplink and downlink signal.&quot;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_controller#Sectorization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_station_controller#Sectori...</a><p>I appreciate your enthusiasm for debate but please do some more research into cellular radio before you weigh in further.

After all, Logic Programming is purely based on automated reasoning using Horn Clauses. It just so happens to be one of the most optimized forms of automated logic, fast enough to be a general programming language (Prolog is one of the easiest languages to solve the 8-Queens problem)<p>Automated Reasoning covers new tricks, like tree pruning, different logic systems or methodologies (Tableau Logic)... but no matter how complicated it gets, it all comes back to the same methodology.

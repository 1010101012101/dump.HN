757647,comment,755131,757002,0,0,jorgeortiz85,,,"No, my argument is that your purist notion of private property doesn't match reality and isn't a good idea anyway.<p>You're right that no one would buy prime commercial real estate and do nothing with it. That's because prime commercial real estate is expensive. But the prime real estate of the web wasn't expensive. In fact, all of it sold for just a few bucks back in the 1990s.<p>Imagine that there was a time when the prime commercial real estate of today was cheap and squattable in perpetuity. Imagine that a handful of people back in the 1600s ""claimed"" the majority of land in the US simply by having seen it (or, even more aptly in this comparison, by having thought of it). Imagine that all this land is their ""property"", regardless of whether they live on it, work on it, improve it, or even care about it. Under such a system, the descendants of these handful of people would today be collecting rent from everyone in the country, whether on prime commercial real estate or otherwise. Rather than a nation of rugged individuals (think Homestead Act), it'd be a nation of landed gentry (think British aristocracy).<p>When it comes absentee landlords, the notion of ""property"" is rather flimsy. What right does an absentee landlord have to an abandoned property? The only thing that maintains an absentee landlord as the ""owner"" of a property is the government's willingness to use force against anyone who claims otherwise.",1250069493

(If I understood your point correctly...)<p>I remember when I was a student, going to parties with my homies, some of them genetically blessed indeed. Even though these guys were very attractive, it was still hard to get girls to feel comfortable around them. I conjecture that went on inside these girls' minds was:<p>""yeah, these guys are quite handsome, but if the market is efficient, then they should have girlfriends or flings accompanying them, and since they are in a group of guys, there must be something wrong with them.""<p>I adopted a different strategy. I started going to these parties accompanied by my best friend only, and a bunch of stunning eastern european exchange students I knew at the time. Oh boy, all of a sudden, it was so easy to get engaging conversations going with members of the opposite sex :-))) [insert evil smile here] I guess what the girls were thinking was:<p>- couple of guys and 5 gorgeous foreign girls<p>- the girls seem to be accompanying them on a voluntary basis, so there must be something interesting about those two guys<p>- if girls of that caliber hang out with them, then they're probably not assholes.<p>Enough of theories. It worked wonders. ""Using"" attractive out-of-my-league female friends as ""social validation"" to flirt girls who were more in my league at parties was one of the coolest things I ever did in my life.

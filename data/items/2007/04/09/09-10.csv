Aside from the cash reserves, they hired one important man, Ray Ozzie, to take over Gate's role and departure.  Ozzie's knowledge, experience and visionary ability, especially in networking/Internet, means that they are not completely sunk.  ""If"" the Microsoft board gives him the time, money and latitude, to express his creative genius.  They have the ability to make a comeback.  It's time for a shakeup at Microsoft.  It should probably start with Ballmer's departure as well.\n",1176112111

This will put a clear limit to what google might claim as ownership. Dito for its contributions while he is hired by google. <p>2° inform (in a provable way) google immediately of the situation and ask them to clarify the issue with you ASAP.<p>3° check the laws in play by yourself. Don't rely solely on what google may tell you or on lawyer advises. It cost some effort, but as a future employer you better know the laws yourself on this topic. <p>As I'm in France the law is published on the web. It is thus easier to do. Don't know what the situation is in the US and your state. I developped an IT system during my weekends and I had to sort the IP issue with my employer. I not only managed to sort it out without paying anything more than one registerred letter, but I also managed to preserve a very good relation with my employer, which I value most. If both play fair and honnest, this comes out naturally. Beware that there are many traps you might be caught in. But don't be paranoid, there are traps for your employer too. It is really worth the effort to learn the IP laws. ",1176111732

How can startups that aren't from cutting edge PhD proposals or started by that rare star hacker (Bram Cohen, Wozniak, etc...) have real and sustainable technical advantage? ",1176109246

It&#x27;s like a plague that simple 3D examples and tutorials almost always features that Three.js library instead of &quot;vanilla&quot; Javascript with WebGL. People should learn WebGL and JS first and later decide if such a library is even suitable for their usecase (known to be slow).<p>It reminds me of 2-3 years ago, where almost every Javascript tutorial was littered with JQuery library function calls. Most Stackoverflow questions were answered with JQuery answers. In the meantime things have obviously changed for the better.<p>With Three.js it&#x27;s still extreme, there are even several books with &quot;WebGL&quot; in the title that cover only or 90% of the content Three.js. In the meantime organisations like Mozilla could start and ditch Three.js in favour WebGL. It would be in common interest of everone.",1446389979

At the very least, bigger companies can afford to play chicken game with safer margin of error. Having more options translates to having more power in keeping the market position.<p>Just one example out of many. Microsoft preinstalls Windows on PCs. I can&#x27;t get e.g. a Linux one because every time someone tries to sell them, Microsoft will signal to the seller that they will have to change the terms of contract with them. Since no seller can really afford to lose MS, they will always cave in and forget about the Linux deal. This is how &quot;the market&quot; actually works in the real world.<p>> Competition still exists even without actual competitors, since the potential for competitors to enter the market is ever present, should the monopolist abuse the consumer.<p>I am sorry, I don&#x27;t buy this, this is wishful thinking.

It&#x27;s like a small head start and works out of the box and there is a comprehensive guide on how to use it and configuring a mail server including a screencast [2], that could be worth exploring.<p>But the thing with a mail server is there are number of steps beyond installation. You need to configure SSL and spam filtering, then your DNS and SPF records. Then you need to test and ensure your mail is making it through. And a mail server requires constant attention. It&#x27;s not a configure once and forget. You need to take care of spam filtering, anti virus, and ensuring your mail server is up pretty much 24/7 without break, as email is important and cannot be down. This can become a huge time sink, hence folks leaning towards hosted solutions like Gmail etc which take care of all of that for a small cost.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/apps/mailbox/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/apps/mailbox/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.flockport.com/using-the-flockport-mailserver/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flockport.com/using-the-flockport-mailserver/</a>",1446389640

And remember that much of the reason for the Hurd&#x27;s u-kernel architecture was in line with FSF goals of user freedom. To get rid of the whole sysadmin/user ring and have the user be master of their own domain, even having private swapped versions of OS services if needed, on top of the flexibility of the translator concept which lets OS services speak any object protocol, including files.<p><i>Past that, doing a microkernel at that time would be foolish and 4.4BSD integrated with GNU components was obvious choice.</i><p>I wouldn&#x27;t have expected such a defeatist attitude from you. Really - trying to push the boundaries of the mainstream was <i>foolish</i> and instead we should have just gotten a GNU-BSD? By the way, they did try adopting an MIT research kernel called TRIX, which had in-kernel RPC and was <i>partially</i> user mode, but that flunked due to the costliness of porting it from the 68000 at the time.<p><i>After certain amount of time passed, there were a number of usable microkernels that could be split off and turned into working systems.</i><p>Ah yes, sure. After you&#x27;re done with a monolithic Unix that the entire industry will settle on, go do a Perl 6 with &quot;we microkernel now&quot; and expect everyone to follow.

That&#x27;s not only dealing with things like file paths and service versions and configuration; it&#x27;s also very stateful.<p>With DevLab, you not only get an environment that very closely matches (or can be made to closely match) production, you also get a clean, blank-slate installation any time you run tests or any other task against your app. If you&#x27;re developing locally, you&#x27;re prone to database cruft, evolving configurations, pre-existing tempfiles, and other complications that can be easily avoided with the use of good development tooling.<p>Now extend that idea to multiple applications: chances are, your team isn&#x27;t developing just one thing. You probably have multiple development concerns, and if you have an architecture like an SOA, you may have a multitude of microservices. When you update the language they&#x27;re based on, be it node, go, python, or anything else, you need the ability to test and update your applications individually. You need your entire team to be using the same versions for the same applications. And more than anything, you need your potentially large team to get all these updates without collective hours of manual work to orchestrate those configurations on their own local machines.<p>My colleague addressed the question of DevLab vs. Compose elsewhere in this topic, but even if you don&#x27;t use DevLab, I do heavily encourage virtualizing your environment to avoid these pitfalls in the way that makes the most sense for your team.",1446388897

However, five things:<p><pre><code>  1. A _lot_ of that is C++98.\n  2. These rules are just proposed. There&#x27;s tons of time.\n  3. They don&#x27;t give you as much safety as Rust.\n  4. Many people have already rejected C++.\n  5. Langauges don&#x27;t die.\n\n</code></pre>\nSo, one and two are kind of related. We&#x27;re still in the &quot;propose&quot; stage for all of this, which means there are still years before this would make its way into the standard. How long have things like modules taken? Who knows when the rules will be final, and when they&#x27;ll actually land. You get all of this (and more) in Rust right now.<p>As for three, while these rules help, and are laudable, they still don&#x27;t give you data race freedom. In general, they&#x27;re not intended to be an ironclad safety system, just something to help catch more cases where something went wrong. See Herb&#x27;s insistence that pointers should be able to dangle in some circumstances, as an example. I saw a comment on Reddit that straddles three and four, here it is: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3m6j2c/cppcon_2015_bjarne_stroustrup_writing_good_c14/cvd3hpf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/3m6j2c/cppcon_...</a><p><pre><code>   > Just follow this set of hundreds of rules (seriously, go read the core\n   > guidelines), ignore 20 years of material written about C++ before the\n   > year 2011, use this non-standard third-party library of stuff we\n   > really like, and you too can have a fraction of Rust&#x27;s compile safety.\n</code></pre>\nThis is phrased a little to sarcastically imho, but there&#x27;s a nugget of truth there. One of C++&#x27;s problems is that it&#x27;s just got too many features, bolted on over decades. Is bolting on yet another feature the way forward? How much of that existing C++ code will even be able to take advantage of these new safety features?<p>A lot of people have already rejected C++, for various reasons. The details of those reasons are varied, and may be good reasons or bad reasons, but the point is, they&#x27;ve already said nope. A lot of people coming to Rust fit in this category. &quot;I tried C++ one time, but it&#x27;s too complex.&quot; &quot;I can write some basic C++, but I&#x27;m not confident my code is correct.&quot; &quot;I write Ruby code, C++ looks terrifying, and I hear it&#x27;s hard never tried it.&quot; And so on. Our industry is huge, there are a lot of developers, and not all of them will use a single language even if it&#x27;s &#x27;better.&#x27; That cuts both ways.<p>And ties into five. I don&#x27;t think the question &quot;Will Rust kill C++&quot; is well formed. A language that&#x27;s used as much as C++ is will never die. We&#x27;ll have C++ code in production for at least my lifetime, I&#x27;d bet. Rust doesn&#x27;t need for C++ to go away. Languages aren&#x27;t the Highlander, there can (and often are) more than one. I mean, look at Python and Ruby. They&#x27;re really similar languages from a PLT perspective, but they&#x27;re both active, healthy, used-by-millions languages, and many of their programmers wouldn&#x27;t switch to the other.

We tried so hard to make it make sense for a TDD workflow, but it was always cumbersome.<p>Compose wants you to build your application into a container, and build and run that container every time you have a task to run. This takes time and a fair amount of cleanup, especially when you want a clean environment to run your tests that doesn&#x27;t persist to the next run. DevLab just wants you to specify the environment to plug your application into, and doesn&#x27;t build a container at all.<p>The result is:<p>- No manual cleanup<p>- No pile of images or processes that stack up<p>- Your project doesn&#x27;t have to be a Docker project. It doesn&#x27;t need a Dockerfile. You can use this for something you plan to clone on an EC2 node and run from an upstart script.<p>- No Vagrant/Ansible/Chef/Puppet, server config, anything. You pick out an image that matches your environment&#x27;s needs (node:4.2, wordpress, go, etc., hub.docker.com is a great place to start) and DevLab plugs your app into it.<p>- More development-oriented features outside of the pure Docker ecosystem that Compose stays confined to. For example, soon, Mac users running docker-machine will get to enjoy ports bound to localhost much like Linux docker users do [1].<p>To get this functionality outside of Compose, we had a monolithic makefile to maintain all of this for us. It wasn&#x27;t DRY and it wasn&#x27;t smooth.

Certainly, the guaranteed immutability, better pre-emptive scheduling, supervision, easy distribution of processes across multiple nodes, and better process isolation meant I felt my code was more reliable than with Go.<p>EDIT: Since you didn&#x27;t mention Erlang, just to give you a point of reference, Erlang message passing is directly between lightweight processes, rather than an intermediate channel like in Go. I&#x27;ve heard people reference it as files vs file descriptors, but for myself, I think of it architecturally. Go creates an abstraction for the message type, that is, create a channel for ~this~ kind of message, and pub/sub to it as needed, and you shouldn&#x27;t have to care about who is subscribed to determine what channel to publish on (it&#x27;s enough to say &#x27;it&#x27;s this kind of message, so it goes on this channel&#x27;). Erlang, on the other hand (and Elixir) send messages directly to different processes, no additional abstraction. As such, you end up thinking about who needs to communicate with who, and how best to do that. So by default, it&#x27;s like having a channel with exactly one known listener. Of course, you can easily build a channel like behavior, by creating a process whose sole job is to collect messages, and determine how to federate them out to other subscribed processes. I prefer the Erlang way because oftentimes the level of abstraction Go gives is unnecessary (and sometimes even a source of bugs, where I did a poor job of defining my messages, and not thinking about who was listening to the channel meant that a process got a message that it should not have, because of another, similarly typed message that it should have; I needed two channels, but created only one), but when it&#x27;s useful I can always easily build it in.",1446387341

The vast majority of people use them in the same way and for the same reasons we use a credit card, to handle unexpected expenses, and pay them off within a few weeks. The number of people carrying balances is only a few percent. Obviously, they would be better off if you could just give them credit cards, maybe, but that&#x27;s not an option.<p>You&#x27;re allowing your beliefs about what it&#x27;s like to be poor override the glaringly-obvious fact that 99% of <i>all the people in the entire world</i> are poor. If it were really the mind-crushingly awful thing you&#x27;re portraying it as, then we never would have built civilization at all because none of us would have any long-term thinking at all.<p>I&#x27;m not going to go look the payday loan studies you point to because it&#x27;s a side-show to the main disagreement we&#x27;re having about what it&#x27;s like to be poor.",1446387080

A coercive monopoly is when government protects the monopolist by giving it favored legal status.

Competition still exists even without actual competitors, since the potential for competitors to enter the market is ever present, should the monopolist abuse the consumer.",1446387043

In our case, it permits us to use the serialize method if available and fall back to the more generic method str otherwise.<p>I would actually prefer if, during serialization, the compiler would yell at me that object C doesn&#x27;t have a serialize method. For one thing, it&#x27;s very likely that, while it does have a toString() method, it doesn&#x27;t have the corresponding fromString() method, making the serialized output useless. For the other, in a sane architecture, if an object does not have a serialize() method, then it&#x27;s either: a) because it shouldn&#x27;t be serialized in the first place, whatever the reason, or b) because <i>it should</i> have a serialize() method, but it has not yet been implemented (and it should!)<p>I understand that this is &quot;didactic&quot; example.

So a billion was (10 ^ 6) ^ 2 and by extension trillion was (10 ^6) ^ 3. A billion today was called a thousand million then. However the US pushed for the value of 10 ^ 9 as a billion (with trillion as 10 ^ 12) and back in 1975 that became the &#x27;world&#x27; standard.",1446386820

As &#x27;richmarr points out, the regulations that many areas have governing what buildings you can and can&#x27;t build are often a matter of safety and reliability as much as anything cosmetic. For essential utilities, there is often a public interest in regulating the behaviour of providers to prevent a monopoly or oligopoly exploiting a dominant market position unfairly.<p>Regulatory capture is a real problem, and from my outsider&#x27;s perspective it does appear that some places, particularly the US, suffer from this kind of regulatory abuse on a damaging scale. However, this is a baby and bathwater issue.

9823769,comment,9822580,9823756,0,0,jsmthrowaway,,,"> 1. Certain people want Reddit to be a haven for free speech, including speech that coordinates abusive actions. The Reddit admins (current and past) don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what Reddit should be.<p>That&#x27;s one way to spin &quot;pick a view on free speech and stick to it,&quot; I suppose. The problem with Reddit&#x27;s relationship with free speech is that it&#x27;s so haphazard, reactionary, and unpredictable. There&#x27;s an entire section of the site devoted to lynching black people, but another section regarding the same exact treatment of overweight people is the one that got the attention. They said that&#x27;s due to &quot;harassment,&quot; when in fact the real reason is because FPH had gotten big enough to put hatred on /r/all, due to its size. Personally, I think both sections of the site are vile, but I <i>vastly</i> prefer a uniform standard being applied to both, rather than which wheel is squeakiest at the moment. If you look at the common theme in the announcements, it&#x27;s &quot;what about ____?,&quot; not &quot;I&#x27;m really sad FatPeopleHate is gone.&quot; That&#x27;s telling.<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone wants Reddit to be a haven for abuse. There are plenty, and I mean plenty, of other sites for that. The latest reaction to FPH&#x27;s removal is due to the Magic 8-ball approach to free speech, which goes all the way back to violentacrez (ban Gawker for outing him, ban /r/jailbait to make Anderson Cooper go away, turn a blind eye to the 50 subreddits that launched in /r/jailbait&#x27;s vacuum and now collectively outsubscribe its legacy).<p>Reddit until very, very recently championed free speech in public. Ellen Pao has consistently walked that back in interviews, which is chafing the longer-term users; her direct statements in contradiction to earlier Reddit causes make me think she&#x27;s a bit more culpable than you imply. I have to say, after six years of my account, I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a change on Reddit in, say, the last six months. Yishan Wong definitely started it, and you may be right about some of the inherited problems; I remember Yishan showing up in a thread and saying if a subreddit generates a lot of gold revenue, Reddit thinks twice about banning it. That it&#x27;s even part of the thought process was a <i>huge</i> surprise to a lot of people.<p>Tonight isn&#x27;t about free speech, though, in the slightest. Victoria&#x27;s sudden firing -- the easy answer is the Jesse Jackson AMA, but I&#x27;m hearing whispers of disagreements with management over monetizing AMAs (a couple of those whispers are showing up in public) -- woke up a bunch of unpaid moderators to the fact that they cultivate a shitload of ad impressions and revenue for an administration team that cares absolutely zero about them. If it weren&#x27;t for moderators, Reddit would be far more awful than it already is, and Reddit, Inc. has done a very bad job of taking care of the moderators who keep the site usable in return for nothing. Your point on this is completely salient and it has been festering as organizational debt; that&#x27;s a really good way to put that, and I&#x27;m stealing it.",1435902871

9823765,comment,9817733,9819732,0,0,tzs,,,"> for instance, you can&#x27;t CBC-encrypt multiple messages with the same key/IV<p>Is this an &quot;always bad&quot; thing, or does it depend on the structure of the messages and what you require to keep secret?<p>For example, I&#x27;ve seen a system that provides for storing secret strings in a database that works as follows:<p>Given plaintext string P, it forms an intermediate string of the form H:P, where H is a cryptographic hash of P. It then encrypts H:P using AES in CBC mode with a fixed IV and key. The resulting ciphertext is stored in a row in the database. The row ID is then used as a token to represent P.<p>The block size of the hash is the same size as the AES block size.<p>It seems to me that this is functionally equivalent to this scheme, which does not use a fixed IV:<p>For plaintext string P, generate an IV by taking a hash of P, xoring that with a fixed constant, and run that through AES in ECB mode using our key. The result will be the IV. Then encrypt the string :P using AES in CBC mode with that IV and our key. Store the result in the database, and also store the IV.<p>I realize that two identical plaintext messages will result in identical ciphertext, but in this application that is OK. If the system is asked to store a string it has previously stored, we want to recognize that the string is already stored and use the same token to represent it as before.",1435902767

I see none of that in the /r/askscience post.<p>It seems to me that there are two major, unrelated tensions in Reddit at the moment:<p>1. Certain people want Reddit to be a haven for free speech, including speech that coordinates abusive actions. The Reddit admins (current and past) don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what Reddit should be.<p>2. The Reddit admins have a poorly structured relationship with the volunteer mods of their largest subreddits. IAmA&#x27;s full-time paid staff member was the biggest evidence of this poor structure, but it has never worked well. [Even if AskScience&#x27;s mods are professional <i>scientists</i>, they&#x27;re still volunteer <i>AskScience mods</i>.]<p>The first tension is between the Reddit admins and a few non-default, somewhat small subreddits (some of which have been banned in the last few years); the second is between the Reddit admins and the large, mostly default subreddits. In both cases, people are fed up with the admins, and in both cases, this may have been going on for years, but they are fundamentally unrelated complaints. You can believe that the admins are doing fine on one while believing they&#x27;re doing an awful job on the other.<p>By and large, the people who complain about Ellen Pao&#x27;s leadership are complaining about tension 1. Tension 2 is organizational debt that Ellen Pao clearly inherited, and while the buck now stops with her to fix it, nobody thinks it&#x27;s a problem of her making. People unhappy about tension 1 (including, potentially, mods of smaller non-default questionable subreddits) may use today&#x27;s tension-2 event to vent anger at the admins, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s only a single complaint about the admins.<p>I&#x27;d also argue that if tension 1 were really a <i>problem</i> (i.e., Reddit staff were wrong), Reddit would be obviously going downhill, while tension 2 can fester as organizational debt for years before exploding, if everyone is well-intentioned.<p>(My personal view, if it didn&#x27;t come through, is that the admins are in the right on tension 1 and if anything aren&#x27;t aggressive enough, but have been doing a bad job of resolving tension 2 for years.)",1435902546

The idea of concentrating on managing a product, a platform, a system, etc. and giving short shrift to the community and interfacing with your user base. This is aggravated by the preponderance of free services, such as reddit, which make it all the easier to write off such interactions as non-productive. Instead there&#x27;s an attempt to interact with the &quot;community&quot; and the &quot;user base&quot; as a conglomerate whole, but ultimately that&#x27;s a weak method of interacting, at some point the rubber has to meet the road and that means person to person interactions and relationships. This is why sales people are so damned valuable, because that sort of interaction is hugely important.<p>P.S. To clear up any confusion, I support reddit&#x27;s recent closure of hateful sub-reddits, there should be limits to the kind of behavior reddit tolerates.

But in many European countries command average salary (with variations due to seniority, obviously). In Eastern European countries, India and China it is for sure a well paid job but not nearly as lucrative as it is in the US.<p>Clarified this point, the drivers of such high salaries are resource scarcity and high demand.<p>On the demand side, there are few relevant uncertainties: basically whether the economy will sustain the growth of the software industry (or, there is no tech bubble) and, on a longer timeline, whether evolution in programming technique will outpace the growing demand for software or not.<p>On the supply side, the main question is whether there will be an immigration reform or not and how it will impact the tech sector. Furthermore, more people are training now in coding than before, both in universities and after university using bootcamps or similar institutions. So the critical uncertainty is whether the new trained people are enough and good enough.<p>My humble opinion, given all these uncertainties and their probable resolution in the long term, is that sooner or later, &quot;software salaries&quot; will have to adjust downward.

The group I work with would kill to find someone good with 30-40 years of experience.  They are just really hard to find -- either they are already happy where they are, are a consultant, are a manager/executive, or they aren&#x27;t very good.<p>The problem is this: If you have more than 20 years of experience and want to continue being a employee programmer you only have a few choices.  You can advertise yourself as a senior programmer and try to command a senior salary.  Or you can advertise yourself as a more junior programmer and ask for a low salary.  If you have the ability to do the senior position, then there is not problem.  If you do not... who the heck is going to hire someone with 20 years of experience who is still performing like a junior?  Even if they are cheap, there is value to the employer of imagining that the employee will develop over time.  Someone who flatlined 15 years ago is not someone you want on your team.<p>The moral of the story is: if you want to be a programmer for your whole career you <i>need</i> to stay on the front edge of the industry.  You have to work your butt off day in and day out to not only stay current but always improve yourself.  There will never be a day where you &quot;make it&quot;.  You will have to justify that senior position that you are going to occupy and show that you are better than the up and coming young wolves behind you.  If you are not prepared to do that, then you are better off not being a programmer.",1435899707

They also run a relatively large business while I am working for a small company. If their legal team decided that protecting their IP is best done by not opening up the company to a lawsuit (have you seen what happened to VMware btw?) than I think it is a pretty safe policy to follow for us the smaller corporation with smaller legal team.<p>I measure freedom in the license context by how much I have to do using a certain licensed software.<p>MIT, BSDL, Apache, EPL -> nothing<p>AGPL -> I need to open up every single thing that touches the service that uses AGPL<p>Which one is more free?

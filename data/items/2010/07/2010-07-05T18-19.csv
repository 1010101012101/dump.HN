Revolving debt is so very rarely used for that though.<p>I can't count the number of smart, successful people I've personally seen hit a minor bump in the road and then get behind on their revolving debt.  Just a few months of penalties and interest quickly eclipses anything you'll gain through incentives, and makes it progressively harder to get back to even.<p>A checking account autopay would only have added an NSF fee to their problems!<p>For me, it isn't worth the gamble.  You have to take enough risks to get ahead in life as it is.  Why reduce your odds with unnecessary risks of convenience?",1278356338

If it weren't for Andres pushing me + attending startupweekend, i'd be doing something here instead of Cloudomatic.  Some verticals I identified:<p>-  Casual geeks.  People who want to know what we know, but just don't have the time + know geeky tricks.<p>-  Urban demographic.  It's valuable and something overlooked in the tech space.  Why do you think all of those things trend on twitter with weird hashtags?  It's because of the urban demographic.<p>-  Family living.  People want tips for better family living.  It's also a valuable demographic.<p>-  College focused.  Do .edu email addresses only and segment by city.  This is how facebook got started and college humor spread.  It's highly viral and highly valuable.  Think financial companies paying for a dedicated email to 100k college kids with good editorial content.<p>-  Male fitness.  Sort of mens health meets GQ.  Fashion, sex, fitness,money,etc.  Women often get all the love here when it comes to content online, but this is a gaping hole.  If you've ever picked up a fitness magazine, you would know advertisers spend a ton here.<p>I think there's more.  I'd start with either the first one or last one.  If you end up doing one of those, I'd love to help in some way possible.",1278356316

1488809,comment,1488348,1488523,0,0,hugh3,,,"The problem is that dummy bids by the vendor in an attempt to artificially drive up the price are against the rules of eBay's auction model. Buyers and sellers both agree to abide by certain rules, and one of those rules is that the seller only gets to make one ""bid"", the reserve, which is secret until it's reached and known when it's surpassed.<p>Now, you could equally well have a different auction model, whereby the seller gets to make as many bids as he likes. But this model would be much less attractive to buyers, since I know even if I'm the only buyer the seller is just going to keep increasing the price until he thinks he's got to the maximum I'm possibly going to spend. So as a buyer I'm much more inclined to buy on the single-reserve system than on the multiple-seller-bid system.<p>Dummy bids are a problem as old as auctions themselves, but it's good to see people being prosecuted when they're caught.",1278355549

Moreover, a defensible patent is so narrow in scope that it provides very little protection by itself. Someone makes a small change to your idea and bypasses the patent entirely.<p>If your idea is good and you execute well, you have little to fear from large competitors. The larger the company, the harder it is for them to innovate.

But there are so many instances where these don't apply that I don't see any consistent rationale other than that's just how the culture evolved based on the current technology and expectations of scarcity, plus the dictates of government meant to achieve some particular social or economic ends (as opposed to protecting some natural right).",1278353380

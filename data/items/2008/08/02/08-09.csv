So it's OK to stereotype gays as being better at artsy stuff, but not OK to think of straights as being better at, well, some other things?",1217667425

264883,comment,264787,264787,0,0,underscore,,,"I'm a gay programmer, and I'm not quite sure how my sexual orientation would affect how I code. If it is any help, most of the people around me seem to think I'm competent enough, at least to the point that they don't complain about what I write to my face. Perhaps they'll find this thread and respond.<p>The more interesting question, at least to me, would be about the experiences of gay programmers (I guess I'm biased). I can't speak for all gay programmers, but I know that my sexual orientation would certainly affect the people I choose to work for (e.g.: I'd like to work for someone who provided benefits for a same-sex partner, or who donated money to gay rights causes, while I'd probably not ever work for a company with a history of opposing (with policies or money) gay rights). It probably also affects the atmosphere of the place that I do work: perhaps co-workers deal with a gay colleague differently (not necessarily on a good/bad continuum: only differently) than they would a straight colleague. I could go on, but you probably get the idea.<p>Most of the replies present when I started this comment were skeptical of the possibility of a correlation between sexual orientation and code quality. I happen to agree. What about the correlation between sexual orientation and employment in certain industries (affecting what code we write)? What about sexual orientation and choosing to be a programmer at all?<p>I'm kind of hoping that this doesn't get downvoted to oblivion: it might make for an interesting discussion (or flame war).",1217666034

An earnest but poor programmer can be fixed and is respectable, the sort of fuck that floods our profession with these ideas that we make insane money or something is obnoxious.<p>EDIT: Never gave a shit or a thought at any point to the fact that he was gay.",1217664863

264874,comment,264274,264763,0,0,pavelludiq,,,"The problem with coffee shops in my area is not that they are bad, but the people that go there are annoying. Usually people between 12 and 20 who spend more time in front of mirrors than its healthy, and talk mainly about that. You cant help it if your town's retarder. I sometimes enjoy going to coffee shops with friends, but can't imagine working there, im not a regular anywhere, so maybe i just haven't found the wright place, so if i find a good comfortable place, i might consider working there.",1217664244

It's not new to create files that are valid in multiple scenarios.<p>OK, So how does it steal your account?<p>I can see that yes, if you can upload an image to a website, and then get it to run as a java applet, your java applet would have the same privileges as any other java applet on that site...<p>So if you've already given facebook permission to access local files via java applets, then the malicious applet could do bad things to your machine.<p>But how does it steal your account?\n""and most other accounts"" - This seems like complete sensationalism to me.<p>There is a whole java applet security model, and this article just seems to be about spreading FUD.",1217664067

<a href=""http://www.psy.herts.ac.uk/wiseman/research/luckmain.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psy.herts.ac.uk/wiseman/research/luckmain.html</a><p>2) The Andy Grove/ Einstein thing, of trying, striving, working really hard and trying to strategically place yourself in the 'right place' will eventually pay off, one way or another. This is essentially what the article adresses. This is a different kind of luck though.<p>3) Apart from personal 'luckiness' and hard work paying off, there are also occasional black and white swans - large random external events which affect peoples lives in good or bad ways. These are unpredictable and outside your control. Nassim Nicholas Taleb has a (quite hideous) website about this kind of thing: <a href=""http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/</a> He may also have written a popular book.",1256209167

896492,comment,896445,896483,0,0,simonw,,,"Many of the operations are documented as being atomic - you can get a surprisingly long way using atomically incrementing counters and atomic set operations. If you search through the Redis mailing list there are some interesting discussions around lock-free algorithms, CAS and potentially adding a LOCK command. There's also a recently commited SETNX command for atomically applying a number of changes to a set of keys at once.",1256208687

The companies would constantly release updates to break the hacks and the hackers would, within hours, have found ways around them. Eventually the companies hired a specialist who released a whole series of seemingly unrelated updates that didn't appear to do anything until the final update was sent - at which point the entire system rewrote itself, locking out the hacker entirely.<p>I can't remember enough details to track down the specific story, but I do remember it was a thoroughly interesting read and I'm guessing someone here might be able to recall seeing it themselves.",1256207585

CS4 is the worst.<p>Photoshop has an incredible number of bugs. So many that it is almost unusable. It occasionally crashes while trying to save a file, which is the worst user experience infraction possible.<p>I hope they fix this crap. It's getting more bloated every revision, and their UI is becoming more and more bizarre with each revision (why did they hack OS X to put window resizers on all four sides? It just makes it impossible to click behind Photoshop).",1234972619

Isn't using specific classes for the divs of the grid in the HTML just as difficult for maintenance purposes as using a table? You're defining specific rows and columns and because you're doing so with class names, that layout information is in the HTML and not the CSS.<p>The point of using CSS for layout is to have the markup be relevant to the content of the document, not for it to be relevant to the styling.

It's always more fun to discuss these things in an open, social setting where the emphasis can be on improving ideas and generating new ones, and can draw people away from the traps of being possessive and defensive about their ideas.<p>Your main challenge is likely to be getting enough volume on there to keep it interesting.  You might try making a dramatically more lightweight way to participate -- a simple ""What would you like to build?"" prompt where people can type an idea anonymously and other users can vote on the idea, comment on it, or turn it into a proposal.<p>In general, you need to find a much more concise way to explain how I get involved and what the benefit is than a 150 word ""basic concepts"" page.

Remember, simply selecting for best fit individuals is not evolution, that's natural selection. Furthermore, reproduction introducing new variants is also not, on its own, evolution, that's descent with modification.<p>Evolution only occurs when you've got descent with modification <i>and</i> natural selection working together to push species toward one niche or another. Certainly evolution can stop. Take, for example, dinosaurs!<p>Of course, extinction is an extreme case. So can an existing species <i>stop</i> evolving? For better or worse, the answer depends on a concept which is still not fully resolved: neutral evolution. The general idea of neutral evolution is that, even when you're not selecting for one variant or another, introducing new variants will make you better fit for the next selection event (presuming you subscribe to the punctuated equilibria views). Essentially, you might not be evolving now (i.e. no selection pressure exists), but you might be stacking the deck to evolve better in the future.<p>...confusing, right?

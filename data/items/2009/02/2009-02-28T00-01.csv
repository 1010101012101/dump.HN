497841,comment,497698,497698,0,0,paulgb,,,"Arguments for the importance of privacy seem to invoke either corruption (eg. 1984, or the Cardinal Richelieu quote) or the risk of error (eg. misidentifying a suspect because they share attributes). These remind me of the arguments used against artificial intelligence research. I see them as problems that can be worked around, not as a basis for more privacy measures.<p>Instinctively I feel that privacy is important, but I can't find any solid justification for the instinct. It bothers me slightly to know that I can be tracked by cell phone signals or a public-transit swipe-card, but I couldn't win an argument for the importance of privacy.",1235782301

497836,comment,497776,497776,0,0,albertsun,,,"A few bits of advice from a journalist who has covered technology before.<p>First, read as many blogs and publications that cover the field your app is in as possible and start paying attention to the bylines and names of the writers you have written about related products. Few things irritate a journalist more than getting pitches directed to the wrong place. An email saying something like, ""I enjoyed your piece about X, here's what I thought of it. By the way, I'm working on a cool project that does (related Y), would you be interested in finding out more?"" will generally be well received.<p>Press releases style emails can also work, but keep in mind, we're used to getting those shoveled at us through a mailing list, so it'll be much less likely to draw attention than a personalized note.<p>Either way, keep it short and simple. Explain what your product does CLEARLY in the first sentence. Don't use superlatives or make outlandish claims. I can't stress this point enough. If a press release goes on about how a product will ""revolutionize this"" or ""reinvent that"" without specifics, it's headed for the spam pile. Don't include canned quotes or statements. If we're interested in finding out more, we'll get in touch. So do include as much contact information as you can.",1235781563
497835,comment,497222,497565,0,0,vlisivka,,,"Imagine following example: you signed contact to guarantee 99,999 uptime - 8-9 hours of downtime per year. First your downtime is 12 hours. Now you need to work more than 1 year without any errors. Any ""500"" error code can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.<p>How you will do error handling and exception handling in that case? If there 1 chance per million that something will work incorrectly due to solar radiation or power fluctuation, how much such temporary failures you will see when your system handling more than 100 millions of requests per day? If you restarted database and all connections to database are broken, should all your current users see 500 error code?<p>PS.
That is real story. ;-)<p>PPS.
I used RecoveryManager to handle errors in the my system. It is very simple: when it receiving an error, it uses it configuration to determine action to take (e.g. call helper method) and responding to caller with code to indicate what caller should do: throw exception to higher level or just try again for few times.",1235781444

497826,comment,497039,497280,0,0,emileifrem,,,"I'm part of the Neo4j team and I'm puzzled about the import problem. I don't know about the size requirements you have but you mention 2.5M nodes and 60M edges and we run systems in production with a LOT more data (billions range). So it definitely shouldn't blow up. Maybe you ran into some bug in an older release or something else was wrong.<p>It's also important to note that Neo4j through the normal API is optimized for the most common use cases: reading data and transactional updates. Those operations are executed all the time during normal operation, whereas an import is typically done once at system bootstrap and then never again.<p>To ease migration, as part of our 1.0 release (June time frame) we will expose a new ""batch injection"" API that is faster for one-time imports of data sets. This is currently being developed. If you have feedback on how an API like that should behave, feel free to join the discussions on the list:<p><pre><code>   http://neo4j.org

But with $100 worth of hobbyist gear, Israeli researchers managed to skim encrypted data off e-passports from several feet away. A student at Cambridge University in Britain went further, intercepting e-passport transmissions some 50 metres (160 feet) away.<p>> That was enough for State Department officials in Washington, DC, to insist that American e-passports be fitted with metal sleeves to shield them, when closed, from prying electronic eyes. The measures seem to be reasonably effective, though e-passports that get wedged open slightly by keys or loose change can still be read electronically from a distance.<p>> Slightly open passports could leave holders vulnerable to physical attack. Each country encrypts data in a characteristic way that terrorists could use to identify the nationality of the person carrying the chipped passport. To demonstrate the point, a firm called Flexilis used a partially opened American e-passport tucked in the pocket of a dummy to trigger an explosion as it passed a dustbin containing a small charge.",1248004274

I'm sure that Ariel is a competent and intelligent person, and probably capable of a lot more than puff PR blogging for moribund corporations. I'm sure she put in an honest and significant amount of work setting up the site and the interview and so on. In fact, her competence is essential. The whole point of the exercise is to cast a character who can convey authenticity.<p>It's like reality show casting. It's not scripted. The people are real. But they're in a role, to create a particular kind of scene. And the scene they probably wanted to create was ""attractive+nerdy girl runs a fansite about our our awesomely cool developers and our cool corporate culture"".<p>Yeah, probably most smart people <i>know</i> that it's really an MS site. But branding exists for a reason -- it works unconsciously.  If anything my comment isn't misogynist, it's anti-straight-male. I'm tired of how predictable men in our industry are.<p>As for Google PR -- it deserves to be satirized too. Their thing is to have developers directly address the public, in relatively plainspoken videos. This entails yet more subtle distortions (mostly by omission), but it's not as flawed as the Microspotting approach.",1248002587

This particular one I've bought after my desktop workstation (IBM IntelliStation, double Xeon, Wildcat graphics, 15K drives..) died after just little more than one year in service. So much for desktop vs. laptop durability. I also prefer the keyboard (and rubber mouse buttons) to the ThinkPad's design.<p>Buying form corporate line has an additional benefit that one can use a docking station for all the external monitors, hard drives, mouse, keybord, speakers and the ethernet cable. Of course I know ThinkPads do have a docking connector too, but Macs do not and I hardly understand how people can trade convenience and commodity price for a shiny paint that wears off from sweat in under a year and a shiny GUI that annoys me (maybe it's just me) almost as Windows does.",1248002520

It's like Pablo Picasso, in the middle of his Blue Period, trying to convince younger painters that red isn't a useful color for serious artists.<p>If you want to study graph theory or combinatorics [1], then calculus will be pretty much useless to you, and you'll naturally go years without using it.<p>Calculus is also useless in some situations in abstract algebra (which are said to have <i>combinatorial</i> character).  There are other parts of abstract algebra, e.g. Differential Galois Theory [2], in which calculus is pretty important.<p>Topology is similar.  Elementary topology is part of the foundation supporting calculus, while algebraic topology is one of the tools that's useful when we try to do calculus (or solve differential equations) in non-Euclidean spaces.<p>Fields making heavy <i>use</i> of calculus include differential geometry, differential equations (ordinary or partial), dynamical systems or control theory.  That subsumes most of physics.  Fields underpinning (and largely inspired by) calculus include real and complex analysis, measure and integration theory (aka axiomatic probability theory).  Also functional analysis, which is a generalization of linear algebra, which is the bookkeeping methodology of calculus in higher dimensions.<p>[1] The first sentence here says it all:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Galois_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_Galois_theory</a>",1248002280

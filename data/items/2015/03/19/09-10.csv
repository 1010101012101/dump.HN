9230981,comment,9228323,9230703,0,0,josteink,,,"> The messiness came with solution files (since VS uses solution files and project files).<p>Indeed. Solution files are not only a terrible to work with in general, they are also unmergeable. They are the number one source of broken builds where I work whenever we do branching and merging. Everyone hates them.<p>Right now we have a two-layer hierarchy: Solutions, which contains projects (which are perfectly mergeable), and projects which contains code. Projects can depend on other projects, and must therefore also be present in the solution.<p>You thus need to redundantly express dependencies across solutions (which cannot safely be merged), and besides the academical (violating the DRY principle) this causes real world problems.<p>What would be neat was if we did away with solutions completely and instead you could have projects depend on other projects directly. And that was it.<p>Then you could create &quot;solution-projects&quot; by adding the actual project you wanted built, which which again might have their own dependencies and everything would resolve itself just nicely.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Eclipse already does this, so what&#x27;s holding Microsoft back?",1426759072

Design in HN to slow down flame wars, I suppose.<p>I think you make good points. People say things like &quot;don&#x27;t ever talk to a police without lawyer&quot;, because they want to make a political point.<p>I am not American, and not resident in the US, but I do not believe that a total &quot;I don&#x27;t talk to police without lawyer, ever&quot; is really wise. Either in US or elsewhere - you have to understand your surroundings.<p>My latest interaction with an American police officer was on a business trip on September 12, 2001. Independent of the bad TV shows the previous day, I was driving to the local office where I was visiting. Boss from Europe called me on my cell phone. I didn&#x27;t think it was a good idea to speak on the phone while driving, so I took the exit from highway and stopped on the curb of a smaller road. After talking for a moment, I noticed a police car stopped next to me. I rolled down the window, and the police asked me why I stopped there. I told him, to speak on the phone. He told me to move over because I would be blocking other traffic. I hadn&#x27;t noticed it but he was right. I said &quot;sorry, I didn&#x27;t notice, I&#x27;ll get moving&quot;, put the phone away and got moving. End of story.<p>Instead of telling him &quot;Speaking on the phone&quot;, should I have responded with &quot;No comment, I want my lawyer&quot;? That would have been absurd, and probably a very good reason for this officer to get suspicious of me, possibly starting to check my papers - which I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s the right to do - and possibly ticket me for simply breaking the traffic law and then being a prick about it.",1426758968

I still find that I need them often, for cases where one case needs to be handled differently from others, which is a very common business requirement.

Most of the good startups have someone with a general vision, which is impossible this way.\n  * Harder to recruit people since there&#x27;s no core idea to get behind\n  * Since the only way these are funded is by a rich person (after all, no VC would ever invest in one), it&#x27;s susceptible to the whims of said rich person.\n  * What happens if something becomes successful? How does equity/spinning out/etc work? And, if it spins out... all the revenue for the &quot;factor&quot; dries up.\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s a lot more, I&#x27;m sure.",1426755979

51138,comment,51109,51109,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I've had a few posts deleted which were ""general chatter"", but were directed more towards one person. Thats understandable however as it can distract from the topic of the post. But it makes it difficult to continue interesting topics of conversation which are starting to diverge from the post. This is where I think a simple messaging system for the site would be useful, especially given the networking incentives of beginning startup entrepreneurs..<p>I think there may also be a general reluctance to post things which are challenging or negative for fear of either being downvoted like crazy, or looking bad in the eyes of YC if you have plans to apply. I wouldn't go as far as calling it sucking up, but it could refrain some people from saying whats really on their mind.<p>The rate of submissions seems to be increasing too, which can make sifting through the new postings more difficult. It also dilutes commenting I've noticed. This could be why major posts like a new PG essay seem to gravitate more discussion. I would personally be game for the idea of limiting the number of new submissions a user can post over a given time. Maybe scale this value based on karma. This would at least make people think more carefully about what they are about to post. I understand this starts to limit the ""anyone can post"" nature of the site, but it could reap an overall benefit for all users by reducing information overload and concentrating discussion on fewer, good submissions.<p>But you bring up a good point.. I'll make a conscious effort to post more challenging, thought provoking comments. I've got karma to burn :)",1189096028

51135,comment,51109,51109,0,0,dood,,,"People expect much discussion of a new pg essay, partly because its his site, partly because of trends in this site so far, and partly a stop-over from the old reddit days. A guaranteed-attention feedback loop, dragging in anyone with an inclination to chat or have a little limelight, lurkers and regulars alike.<p>I too would enjoy more general chatter (of the thoughtful, interesting kind).",1189095796

51133,comment,51109,51127,0,0,aston,,,"I think we should encourage commenting at all costs. The karma system can handle not showing you the uninteresting/bad ones.<p>Actually, now that I think about it, the karma system could be the reason people don't post as many comments. If you submit, you're looking at all upside. But you can hurt yourself by saying something dumb, so people opt to say nothing at all.",1189095620

They get the money in the end, and a lot more of it than they can recover from foreclosures.<p>If somebody owed me a lot of money and had no prospect of paying it, I'd love to see a third party step in and pay with no strings attached.",1189095614

51124,comment,51109,51109,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"No, you are not alone.  But what do you propose?  Like danielha said, some stories are more interesting to talk about than others.  On the features page, I suggested separating ask news.yc posts into another area, so they don't move off the front so fast and perhaps get more discussion going as a result.  However, no one has really up voted that suggestion.  Another alternative is to have a different site that is more of a message board like webmasterworld, but for hackers.  After all, this is Hacker News, not Hacker Discussion.  This is evident in the fact that it is geared more towards new links than open discussion topics.",1189095268

It would even justify the program to the eyes of the public.<p>But, thing is, similar programs have been going on for centuries in all governments. They care only about two things: spying on third countries (enemies, competitors, etc, things that effect commerce and military) and spying on their own citizens (population control, etc). Those programs have roots aeons before 9/11, and aeons before &quot;terrorism&quot; was any real concern of the government.",1370595465
5837941,comment,5837027,5837830,3,0,jlgreco,,,"No, his calculation shows P(baddy|flag)=1/10,000.  In other words, given that the system flags somebody, there is only a 1/10,000 chance that this person was correctly flagged.<p>This is given the absurdly high P(flag|baddy) of .99 (a terrorist raises a flag 99% of the time... good luck with that.) and a P(flag|innocent person) of .01 (meaning that in the US an absolutely staggering 3.19 <i>million</i> people would be wrongfully flagged by this system).  Then there is P(baddy)=1/1,000,000, which implies that we believe there are 300+ terrorists currently in the US that desperately need to be caught.  What the hell have those 300+ terrorists been doing in the past few years?  Wishing they could only find guns the the great US of A?  1/10,000,000 is a far more reasonable number, though even 1/100,000,000 is probably being generous.<p>1/10,000 is <i>absolutely abysmal</i>.  When you start punching in more realistic numbers though the result becomes <i>much worse</i> and you rapidly approach a situation where you would have more luck flagging random US citizens as uncaught criminals than you will with using this system to identify terrorists.  If you permit those sort of absurd odds, then even hiring &quot;forensic psychics&quot; to investigate murders in small towns starts to make sense...<p>This sort of screening flat out does not work for something as rare as terrorists.  It only works when you start bumping your P(baddy) way up <i>(dropping P(flag|innocent person) is not practical, and raising P(flag|baddy) to even more absurdly high levels only gets you marginal improvements)</i>.  Replace <i>&#x27;terrorist&#x27;</i> with <i>&#x27;person of interest to the DEA&#x27;</i> or <i>&#x27;tax cheat&#x27;</i> and suddenly this sort of screening starts to look a hell of a lot more practical....  hmm....",1370595456

Like many (most?) organizations, government is necessarily self-serving, (or self-perpetuating at the very least) and the power imbalance that is amplified by technological change is directed first and foremost at the preservation and survival of the very institutions that hold the reigns. Normally, we might direct our attention to our systems of checks and balances to redress any imbalance of power, but these systems were designed in an age where modern technological capabilities were simply inconceivable, much less effectively planned for. We are only starting to tentatively explore the potentially monumental implications of this shift in the balance of power. Whilst it pains me to admit this, my advice is to admit defeat, to recognize that our privacy (and with it, our freedom) has been irrevocably compromised, and to do what we can to ensure our own individual survival over the coming decades: to wit, offer our full-throated support for whatever objective the agencies claim to be currently pursuing, and to learn to be more guarded and more circumspect about what we say and think.

That he may be pressured not to do so or not is irrelevant.</i><p>It&#x27;s not irrelevant at all. It&#x27;s a real pragmatic issue. The president (all of them, I mean) has advisors, pressuring him to do this or that. He has lobbies going for some things. He can be blackmailed or exposed for some peripheral BS (think of Clinton). He has pressure from his party. He might be complicit and make a quick buck (thing of Halliburton and such). In the end, if he&#x27;s too difficult to work with, he might even be shot (some presidents have. Was it all the work of &quot;madmen&quot;?).<p>The fact is: the president is the president only after he is elected. And to get to that point, he is vetoed himself so much by the party, lobbyists etc, he has to pass so many &quot;loyalty&quot; tests, he is screened so well in order to get campaign funds and support, that nothing really unpredictable can come out of him against the whole system.<p>Despite the BS &quot;profile&quot; articles, it&#x27;s not like any random guy gets elected president.

  Existing and proposed laws, especially as relate
  to the US Patriot Act, etc., provide for secret 
  warrants, searches and seizures of data, such as
  library records.

  Some such laws provide for criminal penalties for
  revealing the warrant, search or seizure, disallowing
  the disclosure of events that would materially affect
  the users of a service such as rsync.net.

  rsync.net and its principals and employees will in
  fact comply with such warrants and their provisions
  for secrecy.  rsync.net will also make available, weekly,
  a &quot;warrant canary&quot; in the form of a cryptographically
  signed message containing the following:

  - a declaration that, up to that point, no warrants have   
    been served, nor have any searches or seizures taken
    place

  - a cut and paste headline from a major news source,
    establishing date

  Special note should be taken if these messages ever cease
  being updated, or are removed from this page.

I found the caveat at the end of the second link interesting:<p><pre><code>  This scheme is not infallible.  Although signing the
  declaration makes it impossible for a third party to
  produce arbitrary declarations, it does not prevent them

People in the world today live in fear of physical harm from their own government. They aren&#x27;t worried about phone call meta data or blanket call logging. They&#x27;re worried about being taken by force with no trial, no ACLU or EFF to help them. Just gone.<p>Ai Weiwei served months in jail for art projects that were critical of the government. Can anyone <i>imagine</i> that happening here, in the country where flag burning is constitutionally protected? There are dozens of countries in the world today that have a near 100% conviction rate for political dissidents. Here in America confessed terrorists have the right to an attorney and god help the prosecution if there was any missed technicality during the arrest.<p>Don&#x27;t dare be a girl trying to go to school in many middle eastern countries. Might get run over by a tank if you openly oppose the chinese government. Offend the king of saud with your actions and you&#x27;ll be literally stoned to death in the street. And we&#x27;re worried about phone call meta data?<p>I think a lot of this is ignorance about how modern counter terrorism works. The most effective tool we have is social network analysis. Find a terrorist and see who calls them, then see who calls those people and out and out. Look at the vertices and edges and dependency networks and we can learn a lot about complex organizations without risking any lives. It&#x27;s understood that this is offensive to many people&#x27;s privacy beliefs, but it&#x27;s the best tool we have.<p>If you want to know why government agency&#x27;s are engaging in this wildly unpopular behavior, here&#x27;s the answer: On 9/11 a lot of people swore to god that it would <i>never happen again</i>. That might sound like a joke to people who never held up their hand and vowed protect and defend. People give their fucking <i>lives</i> to stop threats that you&#x27;ll never know about. Question their methods all you want, they aren&#x27;t going to listen.<p>Also: Save the slippery slope nonsense. There is a 0% chance of the US government becoming an oppressive regime, surveillance or not. Those things just don&#x27;t happen in times of peace and prosperity.

That said, these numbers are a bit deceiving for two reasons:<p>1) WP7 + Windows Mobile is probably still growing in absolute numbers, but just being outpaced by Android and iOS growth<p>2) These numbers only represent consumer devices, not business; from the comScore report: ""Data on mobile phone usage refers to a respondents primary mobile phone and does not include data related to a respondents secondary device."".

The W3C rejected the WHATWG's work initially in 2004; the WHATWG then created the HTML5 specification (largely by building on Web Apps 1.0 + Web Forms 2.0) as a browser-backed guerilla group outside the W3C. The W3C then adopted their work in 2006 (<a href=""http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/166</a>), and a fragile partnership with the WHATWG has been in place since. The W3C therefore deserves little credit for the HTML5 spec - they declared HTML dead in 1998 after all, tried to turn the web into XML (via XHTML), and then eventually came back to earth in 2006.<p>--<p>Surely it's also not simply being pedantic to insist that things like CSS3 (!) and SVG don't get lumped into the ""HTML5"" catch-all.

Yet for some reason, today offering free (deeply discounted, more precisely) stuff to kill competition is considered perfectly OK. I find this quite interesting.</i><p>Not really.  With IE vs. Netscape, Microsoft tied IE into an existing monopoly (its Windows 95 OS).  There is no smartphone monopoly or mobile advertising monopoly.  Even if you consider Google's search and/or ad positions a monopoly, Google isn't giving Android away for free in association with its monopoly, it's giving Android away for free independent of its monopoly (as evidenced by Android phones that don't use Google services by default, instead using Baidu, Yahoo, etc.).  IE was tied into the Windows 95 OS, so customers had little choice in using it.  This doesn't even consider the various agreements Microsoft made with OEMs.<p>Also, behavior that is illegal or unethical for a company with a significant monopoly (e.g. Microsoft in the 1990s) may be legal or ethical for a non-monopoly company (e.g. Google's smartphone business in the 2010s).<p>Edit: I will add that Netscape's business model was probably unsustainable regardless of IE being free.  Web browsers are better off being free.",1312676676

If jobs don't come back now it will be because of economic reasons. It's possible that our education and economic systems are weakened and can't keep up with the moderate tech advance we're experiencing.<p>But there should be a point in the foreseeable future at which technology will progress too quickly for mortals to keep up, despite the best education and economy. It wouldn't be the first paradigm shift of this magnitude. At one point in our past human population increased dramatically from farming, so even if people wanted to go back to hunting they could not. Then towns sprung up because farmers learned to produce a surplus. Then there wasn't enough land for everyone who wanted to farm.<p>Similarly today, we can have some people ""farm"" or do the essential work and produce such a large surplus of food, raw materials, technology, etc., that others will be freed from jobs, just as ancient towns were freed from farming.<p>Frankly we could make such changes with today's technology, but the economy and culture may not be ready.

Very important: keep filing tax returns. Even if you have zero income. Two reasons. (1) It is required. Corporations file even with zero income, unlike humans. (2) Your corporation is spending money (see items 1 - 3 above) so you might as well make a little tax loss that you can use to shelter future profits.<p>5.  Talk to your CPA about other peculiarities specific to you. E.g., sales tax returns if you've been filing them. E.g., payroll tax returns. E.g., local business license.

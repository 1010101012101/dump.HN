When I started looking at N800 tablets the connectivity meant that it was useful in areas with WiFi hot spots. Pretty useless for COMMs. The N810 makes a good computer alternative, but it's no phone substitute. ",1192744599

The basic system for the clock, though, is just my early attempt at learning AS3 and how traditional Flash timeline-based stuff works with the OO world.

There will be a more static one for fantasy writers.  I'll let people enter progress into the widget, and the data will be stored on S3 or an alternative I'm looking at.

Currently ppcoin is a hybrid of proof-of-work and proof-of-stake but potentially could be a low energy version of bitcoin.<p>I have often thought that if bitcoin is really successful it will be worthless, because it will have forced the central authorities to be more fiscally responsible, removing the reason for bitcoins existence.<p>But I can't also help thinking that maybe we just need several competing global centrallly printed currencies, and you can pay or be paid in whichever you choose.

I plugged in my firewire time machine drive and was off to the races.<p>Since then, I upgraded that macbook with an intel 160 gb SSD, and restored from a time capsule back up. No problem. I updated to a retina MacBook, migrated from a now time capsule back up of essentially the same system, and it died. Hardware failure. Proved, with Apple, o. Apple sold me a new one, but had to order what I wanted online. The sold me a temp. Out of paranoia, I built the system back from scratch and just restored my home folder. Then, when the new retina came in (third retina if you're counting), I again rebuilt, and restored just the home folder from time machine.<p>I have also kept using the old 2008 MacBook. Ultimately, I think I should have not tried switching the backup from the '08 to the retina.

4621459,comment,4620423,4621267,9,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"The book actually discusses the problems with running C code on stack machines. To sum up, yes- you absolutely <i>can</i> run C code on a stack machine, but you lose most of the advantages of the architecture. Stack machines make procedure calls very inexpensive and encourage the use of very short procedures with a small number of variables in scope at a given time. The stack operators that are available provide quick access to a few elements at the top of the stacks at the expense of random access to elements that are deeper. Stack-oriented languages like Forth make the programmer aware of this and encourage breaking tasks down in this manner. Idiomatic C has procedures which are at least an order of magnitude longer and have many more values in scope at a given time. This provides a compiler with a fairly uncomfortable and difficult optimization task.<p>Speaking as someone who works with compilers and really likes stack machines, I don't think they will provide much practical value unless programmers are willing to adapt their languages and their approach to programming to the strengths and weaknesses of the paradigm.",1349552356

One more thing to add: if I was in your position I would be thinking more broadly about how to best use my math background within the software development world.  You're worth a lot as a programmer.  You're worth even more as a programmer with a PhD in math, providing you can find the right opportunity to apply your skills.  You may not notice a big difference in starting salary if you don't have a lot of experience, but if you choose the right path you can likely make much, much more in a 5-10 year time frame.  In my current company, we have some minor issues finding good programmers.  We have major problems finding programmers that are really good at developing the fundamentals of an approach for solving really hard business problems (hard from an algorithmic perspective).<p>It may be that your thesis topic is far removed from practical applications, but you likely have a strong enough foundation in math that you would be great at working on a lot domain specific applications.  Some others mentioned machine learning, and this is likely a good option, but only one of many. Spin this around and think of it from the business side.  Where are there opportunities to put more robust analytical solutions in place in the business world?

No matter what level of talent and competence you have, there are very few opportunities in this field to make a nice living. You're pretty much relegated to becoming a tenured professor (good luck) or working your way up in an established biotech firm doing work many would consider mind-numbing. At best, you're looking at the low-end of six figures for someone with decades of experience and an amazing track record, and there are very few of those positions. You can go the entrepreneurial biotech route, this is HN after all, but considering the small number of successful firms we can safely leave that option out for the purposes of salary estimation.<p>I think this is a factor of latency in added value. It seems to me that higher salaries are often given to those who can provide immediate usable value in the short term (lawyers, stock traders, some programmers). Long-term value-add professions, such as biology and many other R&D fields, tend to get the short end of the stick salary wise.

The best data I can find for mid-2008 on the Internet says about 50 in mid-2008.<p>Looking for newer data, according to the last several updates on <a href=""http://peter.sh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peter.sh/</a> at this point there are about 100 daily WebKit commits (not all by Google, obviously) and about 120 daily Chromium commits.  That's not counting the parts of Chrome that aren't WebKit or Chromium.  What fraction of the WebKit commits are from Google is an interesting question; as of early 2010 according to <a href=""http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/02/webkit-commits.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neugierig.org/software/chromium/notes/2010/02/webkit-...</a> it was around 40-45% and growing rapidly.<p>Now going from ""number of commits"" to ""number of engineers"" is hard.  For comparison, as of today according to <a href=""http://oduinn.com/blog/2012/09/04/infrastructure-load-for-august-2012/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oduinn.com/blog/2012/09/04/infrastructure-load-for-au...</a> Mozilla has about 200 commits per day, but about half of those are to the automated testing repository, not to the main code.  So that's about 100 commits per day.  Mozilla right now has around 700 employees, I believe.  So if you assume similar commit patterns (which is an assumption, granted), Google certainly has 1000+ people on Chrome now.<p>But I'm also not sure you need 1000+ people to hit $250 million/year in spending.  In addition to Silicon Valley compensation packages, there's also a lot of test infrastructure and whatnot as part of every browser project which costs nontrivial amounts of money to create and maintain.<p>Again for comparison, since there's data available there, Mozilla spent about $63 million on ""software development"" in 2010 ($85 million if you include stuff like office space, HR, marketing, etc) according to <a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/documents/mf-2010-audited-financial-statement.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/documents/mf-2010-audited-...</a> and had about 200 engineers at the time, I believe... and Mozilla does not give out huge stock bonuses, like Google has done with Chrome.",1349550418

That means 10 times a day for 30 days if you are really crazy about it (you are either a teenage girl or you are trying to piss off your neighbors).  Or 3 times a day for 100 days.

People come over and you get out the records.  They look through your CD or record shelf while they are at your place. This ritual is how people connect, find out about the other person and it opens up conversations.  That era is gone.<p>Digital weakened that and selling digital is just a fake simulation of the era of buying physical recordings.  We know its dead, it was transitory and the era of replication is over.  Its not just the economics, its abundance.<p>Still, buying music (even if its a dead art form) is not to obtain a utility value.  Its purchasing a signifier of self identity.<p>I've had Spotify beta since 2008 and I've loved going through the massive back catalogs and listening to stuff.

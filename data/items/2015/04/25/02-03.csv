Cyclic dependencies are a real beast to reason about, and I like that F#&#x27;s lexical scoping means I need to opt-in to mutually recursive functions with `let rec`.<p>You&#x27;re probably right that it feels unfamiliar to Java/C#/Scala programmers, but I enjoy the sense of security that F# and other restricting languages provide.",1429930765

MMO&#x27;s are social games, and even if they don&#x27;t explicitly give you a token for having fun with your friends, saying that they &quot;don&#x27;t encourage fun&quot; is pretty false.<p>I mean really, why do you think people get gear? It&#x27;s so they can play more parts of the game and have more fun.<p>Personally, I can&#x27;t really defend dungeon running that much because I always liked PvP more -- having human opponents to fight was always more fun for me, and the game certainly encouraged that. Some of my friends will still talk about how they were the top of their server or server group, and have folders of screenshots of them beating other prominent PvPers.<p>I never got very into WoW because by the time it got popular with my friend group in earnest I had switched to Linux and wine only ran WoW at about 20fps. But I had plenty of fun playing it and I barely got into it at all. Saying that the game doesn&#x27;t encourage it is total bullshit. Finding night elf in Warsong, chasing them down, and watching their health drain from my warlock&#x27;s curses was some of the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had in a video game. And I got a shiny token for that, too, so there.",1429930643

9436990,comment,9434760,9436535,0,0,throwaway_gm,,,"In vanilla, I spent one full night just swimming around the Eastern Kingdoms on my druid. I&#x27;d recently heard rumors about the Ashbringer possibly existing in the game, just waiting for some wandering soul to come across its incredibly well hidden home, possibly requiring high level fishing skill to attain. Despite the fact that the scenery was mostly repetitive and to most anyone else should have been incredibly boring, I really enjoyed the evening.<p>I later became a Game Master and had the ability to fly invisibly through the terrain on live servers and occasionally would make a point to travel to random nooks, either not normally accessible or else very hard and time consuming to reach by legal means, and that was fun too. This was before flying mounts: characters would appear to swim through the air and could be made to travel very fast indeed.<p>The best hidden secrets in the game were things like The Chair, at the base of The Room, an underground dungeon that could only be reached by flying through the terrain of a castle that stood on Game Master Island, which itself could only be accessed using Game Master powers. Rumors were that early rule breakers in the game, perhaps in beta, were transported into The Room where all they could do is sit in The Chair or not. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s true.<p>Probably people discovered all this on private servers as well, but there was definitely something magical about doing it on live realms - at least for me.",1429930320
9436989,comment,9436828,9436828,0,0,heimatau,,,"Here are a few pieces of advice:<p>1. Take it easy. Relax. Rest. Take a break. 100% break for maybe 2 weeks. If you can&#x27;t afford it, change your job, work enough to pay your bills and relax with all the extra time (provided you don&#x27;t live in an expensive city). Find a way to GET AWAY from the computer/tech. The break will help you think clearer.<p>2. Change your definition of &#x27;success&#x27;. Something more like &#x27;doing what you like and getting paid to do it&#x27;.<p>3. Improve your skills. Nothing to show for it? I hope not. Either way, find ways to improve your skills. Code reviews, open source, etc.<p>4. Work for someone else. Many people started their own business FIRST by working for someone else. After 9 months to a year they felt confident enough to do their own thing. I&#x27;d suggest you follow in their footsteps. Support someone else&#x27;s business that will pay you.<p>Good luck in your endeavors.",1429930287

Getting machines in that building was never hard or expensive.<p>But there was a whole cottage industry built up of consultants which promised to tell you which specific <i>room</i> or <i>cabinet</i> in a room had shorter cable runs to the exchange.

(No double-spends, no dust transactions, etc).<p>While there are data structures in a git commit that must be present and/or follow a particular set of semantics, git does not enforce anything about the _contents_ of those commits.<p>Another key distinction: blockchains seek consensus, whereas divergent forks in git repos are by design.<p>EDIT: I should probably not distinguish too much between consensus and rule enforcement, as those two are obviously intertwined. :)",1429929119

For most of the last decade I bought used Thinkpad T42&#x27;s for $100-$200 (see the empirical depreciation curve here [1]), beat them up for a year or two, then swapped the hard drive into a fresh machine when I finally and inevitably killed the old one. No downtime, no waiting for repairs, no tears shed over the death of a fancy laptop.<p>If you&#x27;re on a budget, or in situations where repair downtime is unacceptable (eg travelling and working internationally) it looks from this guide like a master + spare from the T4xx-T5xx series is your ticket.<p>[1] <a href=""http://alangrow.com/projects/laptop-prices/#T42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alangrow.com/projects/laptop-prices/#T42</a>",1429927409

I put that in quotes because as someone pointed out there is no recognized cure, and I have not stopped, so I don&#x27;t know if the condition would return. But it beats the heck out of inhaled steroids. Going on 1 year with no meds and no problems - PFT says lungs function above average. Of course YMMV, but why not try it?",1429927251

Clever folks will realize that finding which AWS region(s) host(s) the ELB is trivial with curl --trace-time and ping, since you can deduce the RTT from Cloudflare&#x27;s proxy through to the ELB. You also know geographical Route 53 and other tricks aren&#x27;t in use, because you automatically lose that information through Cloudflare.<p>I&#x27;m fairly confident it&#x27;s in us-east-1 based on a quick glance.",1429927235

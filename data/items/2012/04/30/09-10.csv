Also HTTPS is only secure if you trust the cert companies, which I don't after the multiple fake certs issued last year (with at least one *.google.com presumably issued to Iran).

3908615,comment,3907562,3907562,2,0,jacobolus,,,"I really like this metaphor. I think one of the biggest problems with the way we spend our modern lives is that weve made the payoffs at the ends of arcy activities (media consumption, tweeting and snapshotting our daily lives, buying food from restaurants instead of hunting or even cooking, buying clothes instead of making them, buying houses instead of building them, hiring mechanics and plumbers instead of fixing our own things, hiring landscapers instead of growing our own gardens) so incredibly stimulating that we lose patience for loopy activities. Up to a certain point, we get more pleasure out of just enjoying the fruits of mass production and other peoples labor. But we run a real danger of forcing the loopy parts out of our lives too much; the loopy parts are where Cziksentmihalyis flow, creativity, mastery, and the most fulfilling kind of happiness lie. At the extreme, people organize their whole lives around bucket lists of arcy items that can be checked off, each with a discrete endpoint.<p>And we dont properly recognize that the room for learning is much greater when were in loops; schools, instead of teaching us to put connections together and ruminate, encourage us to memorize and regurgitate. Very arcy, a singular path through a system that someone else previously explored.",1335779703

It means that people are upvoting it because they agree with the sentiment, while not realizing that neither their nor slavak's opinion of Atwood's writing should be interesting to anyone. They shouldn't be interesting, because the opinion is on the one hand <i>unsupported</i> and is on the other hand based on the fundamental attribution error [1].<p>I say unsupported, because if anyone actually read the supposed supporting links, there would at least be a discussion concerning the first link in these comments. At least, I don't see how the contents of that post disqualifies Atwood. I don't think upvoters are actually reviewing the evidence to see if they agree with <i>this</i> reason for disliking Atwood.<p>Concerning the second link: if you write off Atwood based on occasional mistakes, you are committing the fundamental attribution error [1]: thinking that <i>someone</i>, and therefore <i>all</i> his writing, must be worthless, simply because he <i>sometimes</i> writes nonsense. Never forget that smart and interesting people also make mistakes.<p>Atwood takes the time to air and explain his ideas about programming. He's not a great writer or a deep thinker [2], but that doesn't matter: he <i>is</i> one of us thinking about what it means to be one of us. I find all of his thoughts interesting, if only to see how someone can come to a different conclusion based on the same premises. They are interesting even if I disagree and even if he is wrong, because it shines a light on how colleagues may think about things. For instance, the second link clearly warns me that I can never take for granted that someone understands what NP-completeness means and have to verify it.

3908588,comment,3901252,3901561,1,0,ars,,,"> Well, not all - Buddhism, for example doesn't posit a specific creation story, with or without a creator sentience.<p>Yes, that is true. After reading a lot about it I would have to consider Buddhism the epitome of a non-logical religions (which, if you recall was the reason I brought up creation). All its teachings appear to have nothing backing them except someone thought of it.<p>It claims to require evidence for things, yet there is no evidence at all for any of its core teachings. Basically it says that due to meditation someone figured out these things - but that someone provides no evidence of this except his say so.<p>It has lots of interesting elements that are praised as being compatible with science, but those are basically philosophy/psychology and have no religious elements to them. Lots of interesting thought about the nature of people - which I guess made it attractive to people. But the religious parts (other worlds/planes of existence, enlightenment, karma, etc) have nothing backing them except one man said so.<p>If you are going to start a religion you're going to have to do some pretty heavy duty miracles (and in front of thousands, not just your close friends) in order to convince me that you didn't just make it up. (By me I mean a person who was alive at the start of the religion.)<p>Obviously a huge different between science and religion is that science can be proved <i>now</i>, and religion can only be proved when it started.<p>Once you do those miracles you have proven yourself and I can believe the rest of what you say without evidence (another large different from science).<p>To be a logical religion it must have made sense to the people who were alive when it started. Those people must have been able to verify every claim. Obviously we can not verify that what the religion says is what actually happened, but if you assume it to be true it must at least it must be self consistent and verifiable to those people who were there. And Buddhism is not, but religion can be, and that is my argument.",1335778703

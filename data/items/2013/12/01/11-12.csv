6826961,comment,6826856,6826856,17,0,dagss,,,"As a Norwegian this keep coming up in lunch conversations. I just bought an old used car from somebody buying a Tesla.<p>What we come back to is the very high sale taxes on new cars in Norway (our &quot;rule of thumb&quot; is that cars are close to twice as expensive in Norway as in some other countries), but that most(/all?) of those taxes are waived for electric. So the alternative to getting, e.g., a Tesla is paying almost twice as much for a &quot;similar&quot; BMW. Same story for lower-end cars.<p>Also, on the commuter high-ways leading in to Oslo, there&#x27;s one lane that&#x27;s reserved for bus+taxi+electric (similar to the 2+ or 3+ person-per-car lanes in California). There&#x27;s a joke that there&#x27;s a standing queue of Teslas in that lane now (though I don&#x27;t drive there so I haven&#x27;t seen how much of an exaggeration that is).<p>Also, electric don&#x27;t pay on the toll roads, which saves you 3-4$ each time if you&#x27;re living outside towns and commuting in.",1385899061

6826951,comment,6826819,6826819,13,0,jballanc,,,"It seems that with any cause, advocates typically break down into two camps: militant and inclusive.<p>The militant camp feels the only way to right the wrong they perceive is through positive action and active repression of the repressors. The inclusive camp feels that incremental change that improves the injustice they see will, given enough time, right the wrong without the need for punitive actions.<p>This has been the case with civil rights (MLK vs Black Panthers), environmentalism (WWF vs GreenPeace), animal rights (ASPCA vs PETA), and on, and on...<p>If I had to guess, I&#x27;d suppose that activists tend to break down along these lines because those they oppose break down in a similar fashion. There will be those who embrace the injustice and actively defend its existence. Then there will be those who don&#x27;t perceive the injustice, or don&#x27;t recognize its severity, but are open minded and willing to change.<p>I point this out, because I think it&#x27;s useful to recognize these camps and to which you belong. I&#x27;m not willing to say one is right and the other is wrong. I suspect both are necessary to some degree. But if you look at the whole discourse in question here, some of the most disheartening exchanges are between individuals on the same side of the issue, but in different camps.",1385898731

Photographs have different perspective and lighting than what you see with your own eyes and paintings that have been made by tracing or even merely copying photographs almost always look, well, like someone smeared paint all over a photograph.<p>If you look at a Vermeer painting, you&#x27;ll find it does not look photographic at all. The objects in the picture are almost tangible and seem to jump off the canvas. This is an effect that is only achievable by having very strong 3D skills: you basically have to be able to paint even more realistically than mere realism. So it might very well be that Vermeer used some tools to get a feel for what it was he was going to paint and maybe even to study the fleeting effects of lighting, but the final paintings themselves are without a doubt made by someone with exceptional skill.<p>TL;DR;Vermeer did not use these techniques because his paintings are way better than what can be achieved using only these techniques.",1385898389

I studied AI and robotics in late 90s / early 00s and Rodney Brooks&#x27; Behavior-based robotics and NASA&#x27;s approach were in vogue and were given as examples how to do things (and I believed them too). There is some parallels to MVP thinking in tech community.<p>What I find interesting is that compared to Brooks it was actually Sebastian Thrun that managed to lead teams to build something remarkable (self-driving cars). IMO, his approach was never based on any single philosophical idea or AI technique, but instead his teams build robotic systems that combined many approaches, and the target was always to build something that worked in a real-world situations, like his museum robot.",1385898149

I am a practicing scientist, I work in alternative energy and develop semiconductors. I am not a climatologist, and it is not likely you are either. Expert-level knowledge matters, unless you&#x27;ve yet to master anything.<p>The climate is a very complex system. Small perturbations can have unexpected results, see the butterfly effect. We do not know the whole picture, but neither do you. Caution and conservation would suggest we want things to remain the same, such as CO2 levels in the atmosphere.<p>Producing carbon dioxide by thermal combustion is old technology. Ultimately fossil fuels are solar energy, the overall solar-to-electricity efficiency for fossil fuels is very low, <<1%. We can make PV with >40% using evidence-based principles developed using the scientific method. Scientific methods and principles are used in climate research. Cherry picking is not what I do when it comes to the scientific majority. If they are wrong and they later determine this, great, it is science. If they are right, great, it is science. If you ignore the scientific conclusion, you are not practicing science unless you are a researcher working to show why other experts are mistaken.<p>Experts have concluded that anthropogenic CO2 is a real and potentially serious problem. I have to trust them because my time is better spent developing potential solutions rather than rehashing their work. We advance by building off the shoulders of our predecessors.<p>The costs of being wrong about anthropogenic climate change and doing something are negligible especially if we make progress while doing so, but the costs of being right and doing nothing are potentially dangerous if we destabilize systems which require predictability such as agriculture.",1385898120

Check duck duck go or start page or evil google.<p>## 2) buy special domain name\nUse domain name in following format:\nssl-subj-key-id-$SSL_SUBJ_KEY_ID.com,\nwhere $SSL_SUBJ_KEY_ID should be one of the ssl certificates parameters called Subject key ID or SKI, which according to RFC3280 [1] is essentially sha1 hash of public-key of your cert.\nIt is necessary to divide hash using &#x27;-&#x27; into two strings to shorten the domain name.\n### Example\nssl-subj-key-id-a3b8cd018b99d899323-32659ac89d98bb8988d.com<p>## 3) Inform your users\nUnfortunately not only the domain name is crazy long you also have to educate every non geek user how to check that the certificate is ok.\nThey have to be instructed to go to the details of obtained certificate and find the SKI in the cert and then painfully check the hash with the domain name they got from you.\nHowever if the source of the domain name is not vunerable to man in the middle then this method on the other hand increase little bit the security since this forces everyone to check the authenticity first time they visit the site.<p>## Or later just buy signature of CA\nand increase security even more.<p>## References\n[1]  http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3280.txt<p># BTW https://gnunet.org is gonna be BIG!\n# Happy hacking !",1385896959

6826885,comment,6825557,6825692,1,0,chestnut-tree,,,"I agree - it&#x27;s still perfectly possible to design clear, attractive (and perfectly functional) websites with just HTML and CSS (and maybe a little bit of Javascript). The page weight of even simple-looking sites (like a blog post on medium.com) is surprising large (admittedly, probably not due to Javascript but due to web fonts).<p>I personally really like the use of web fonts. Using a service like Fontsquirrel, and limiting the number of font weights you use (regular, medium, italic etc), you can optimise the font file size to be smaller than what Google serves up through their font service.<p>I&#x27;d say to the original poster: if you really want to experience whether Javascript is slowing down the internet, try browsing popular sites with Javascript disabled (use an add-on like noscript on Firefox). You can judge for yourself how much faster browsing the web feels. See how many sites break, and then, when you enable Javascript, ask yourself if those same sites could work perfectly fine without Javascript or with minimal Javascript.<p>If you try running a browser session with Javascript disabled, not only do many sites break (as expected), but plenty of sites serving plain text articles simply won&#x27;t display their content either[1]. HTML is designed for plain text content, why do we want to wrap it up in Javascript? The rise of Javascript frameworks like meteor is exacerbating this trend. Some developers are using these frameworks for outputting everything to the web whether it&#x27;s a list of links or a plain text blog page. Do we really want to go down this path?<p>Some sites load fast whether Javascript is enabled or not, but for me, the question of whether Javascript is slowing down sites is closely bound up with the question of whether Javascript is needed for everything on the site in the first place.<p>[1] As an aside, try viewing the Official Android blog from Google with Javascript disabled and you get a blank page. When enabled you get a blog site that could easily be rendered in plain HTML and CSS. <a href=""http://officialandroid.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://officialandroid.blogspot.co.uk/</a>",1385896760

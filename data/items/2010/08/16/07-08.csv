I foolishly forgot to remove my noprocast setting so I was essentially locked out of hacker news while this has been up.<p>I would like to point out that I worded my question poorly. I do not agree Nigeria/Africa cannot create world class startups. I meant to say like RobFitz pointed out below: Why does PG and others like him capable of change write off a whole continent without trying.<p>Nevertheless, you guys as usual have got an amazing discussion going. Thank you!<p>I fully understand the points a lot of you have raised and it boils down to two things.<p>1: Lack of Trust\n2: Lack of infrastructure (Legal, Human resources, Power, e.t.c)<p>In my book, I thought an identifiable problem breeds opportunity. We have a market western countries are unwilling to serve because the perceived risk outweighs the perceived opportunity. America had the highest fraud but is not blacklisted because the opportunity outweighs the risk and I believe it is the same for Nigeria/Africa. I believe there is an opportunity for our local companies to act as local representatives of existing global companies and combine local knowledge with international skill to create businesses back in Nigeria/Africa.<p>I do not think location matters in creating a product that has potential as anyone can launch a Rapportive from anywhere in the world. Of course it matters when scaling it.<p>From what I have seen, our greatest challenge stems from the fact that our people are trying to succeed against the odds. We do not have access to mentors or education that will help us tackle these problems so we are left at a very bad advantage. We struggle to have belief on ourselves because people we look up to have written us off. We have a long rough road ahead and we will trudge on. one day we will succeed. All I ask is for people like PG (who still hasn't responded) and HN'ers to have a little faith in us. Believe me, it helps.",1281943678

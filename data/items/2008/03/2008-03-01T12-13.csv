I personally think, only MS can have use of this program, I doubt xobni will ever have any serious clients in the enterprise, they product is ... not that usefull in my opinion! And it target totally the wrong paradigm, more power in an non web client, this is useless, the correct place for this functionality is an enterprise portal! not outlook",1204374935

In other words: no business wants to buy software.  They don't care about it at all.  What they want is something that will help their business, and someone who knows both the software and the business is better able to connect the two.<p>BTW, ditch the PHP and Mysql and look at some other stuff like Ruby on Rails, Django, Postgresql, and, yes, Javascript.  Some PHP won't hurt, but I don't think it's the ""state of the art"", although you can certainly still get things done with it.",1204373093

i'd really appreciate anyones feedback/advice to help me out of a career choice dilemma. last year after a brief(ish) spell of unemployment i started a masters in e-business to boost my career prospects. i am now 33 and about to graduate soon.  thing is, i really started to get into the programming side of things - learning php, mysql, javascript etc, and starting to teach myself python and unix programming. Now, i can't see myself going back to a business oriented career having tasted  such delights. should i leave the web dev/programing to the bright young things or  can i find a niche for myself somewhere? getting experience is more important than the salary. all comments/opinions/exhortations to wake up and smell the coffee will be very gratefully received. thanks in advance.",1204372815

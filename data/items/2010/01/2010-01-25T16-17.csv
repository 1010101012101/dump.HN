Well yes you could say that there are definately features worth charging for. The fact you can manage unlimited projects, assign tasks to collaborators, upload files to projects and submit invoices for those projects are all features that could be charged for. I don't think its right to take some features out for 'standard' users and only allow 'pro' users to use them because the features are dependent on each other in my opinion. So the best thing to do is limit the use, to say 10 projects and invoices.<p>Thanks for the comment.",1264438363

Publishing houses put books together by hiring one meta-author to write an outline for a book, then bid out the actual writing to junior authors. The publishing houses would own the rights to the characters, series, and future books. When a particular series takes off, their only expense is hiring junior authors to ""fill in the blanks"" on future novels. Sounds immensely more profitable for publishing houses for the current model. Why would a publishing house develop individual authors if the new meta model is so much more profitable?<p>As interesting as I found the business model, if the end product is anything like Patterson's novels, I fear for the book industry. Would Harry Potter have been written by a down-on-her-luck JK Rowling if she could have gotten work as a ghost author for a publishing house?

In my subjective(+) opinion, Hg Queues are designed to work around the suboptimal design of branches in Hg.<p><i>Mucking about with a lot of small commits</i> is a Good Habit and very useful when working from two different computers, but makes the Hg repository log terribly noisy.  Eg. it invariably results in several ""Oops, I forgot to add imgs.idx in the last changeset."" or ""This does not compile, but I committed it for backup purposes because I'm updating from Vista to Win7.  Please check out the next changeset if you want to compile."".  Git naturally supports squashing of commits to solve this, while Hg sans Queues does not.  Git also allows you to kill off experimental branches that lead nowhere, while in Hg they live forever unless you make the ""branch"" in a queue ecosystem.<p>I will also pre-emptively counter a counter-argument which tend to always come up when I talk about this: ""Swallow your pride; allow people to see your mistakes."":  It's not about that; it's about keeping the repository history somewhat <i>readable</i>.

You can try to make do by translating the meaning of those quux into your favorite language, but the fact is that ""gravitas"" doesn't really mean ""formality in bearing"", so there's some difficulty in working that way.<p>Consider recursion: Generally accepted you can simulate it with stacks and lists, the recursion quux is very powerful because binary tree traversal is simply walk(t){walk(t.left);walk(t.right);}<p>Recursion is available in many languages, but not all languages. In <i>those</i> languages an expert programmer won't have the quux for recursion and you'll see lots of arrays and array resizing as the programmer simulates recursion when it is needed- and terrible contortions when the function can be implemented without recursion.<p>Without knowing more about your background, it is difficult to give a better example than that. If you know Java and perl, this is why Java programs written by a perl programmer look strange to a Java programmer: The perl programmer is using ""perl quux"" to work out the program in their head, and is translating them to Java syntax and grammar. I suspect that you've seen other examples you can use here.<p>The important bit: Lisp has a powerful quux in it; it is powerful because it reduces huge problems to much simpler problems.

The fraction of taxes paid by upper income folks is higher now than it was during the 91% days.  Federal income tax is only paid by folks with greater than median income.  (Yes, lower income folks do pay SS, but they get it back and more in retirement.  SS is much less favorable, in rate of return, for upper income folks.)",1264435519

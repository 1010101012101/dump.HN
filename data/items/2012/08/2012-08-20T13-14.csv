The rest of the world is only just starting to realise again that perhaps we have cultural issues that lead to low quality results.

4407559,comment,4407188,4407506,3,0,cantankerous,,,"I think the big problem with all the copy paste code is that you wind up with many redundant dependencies and equivalent pieces of software in varying qualities.  Granted that it's open source, you can't rely on any kind of competitive (ie market-driven) mechanism to improve all of these redundant pieces of software over time.  This is an inefficient part of how things are done....but that's not to say there's an obvious, more-efficient alternative to what we're doing now.",1345471145

I would love to see autoconf massively simplified or outright avoided for most projects and the best way to do that would be to start providing good examples of how unnecessary it is even for major projects.<p>The way to address oversights in the bazaar model isn't to cram everyone back into the cathedral but to build support for change by showing where something is clearly better.<p>One area where PHK might see this is the way Linux has flown past FreeBSD - not due to endlessly-debated questions of kernel superiority but rather because Linux distributions like Debian provided a clearly superior experience for the overhall system by rejecting the decades of accumulated hacks (i.e. the ports system, monolithic config files, etc.) which had been the status quo for years and building better tools to reduce management overhead.",1345471139

And After Amazon takes the cut for doing the fulfillment, you are left with pennies per sale in profit if you are lucky enough to get the volume sales.<p>Another unexpected negative aspect of using FBA is that occasionally Amazon fulfillment centers claim that there is ""something wrong"" with your goods or they are ""damaged in shipment"" and they refuse to store them or ship them.  You have to eat the cost in these cases.<p>I think FBA can be useful if you are a merchant with a specific product line that won't experience direct competition, or if you are a small merchant trying to build some traction.<p>On a side note, I think FBA is a brilliant win-win strategy for Amazon: they get paid for storing stuff whether it sells or not, and they get merchants to test out product lines at ZERO cost to themselves.",1345471058

4407542,comment,4407188,4407188,18,0,calinet6,,,"Architects don't build cathedrals anymore, either. Neither do most software architects. Yet, look what they have built: an incredibly diverse collection of structures of all shapes and sizes, all working together to form an imperfect yet efficient system. Surely its success is due in part to its flexibility and <i>imperfection,</i> and the fact that they are no longer over-engineered and inflexible behemoths made from stone.<p>If you try too hard to design a rigid structure around anything, it can come back and bite you in the ass. Part of the reason why this seemingly disorganized and haphazard collection of buildings makes a working and thriving metropolis is because of its diversity and resilience to change and progress. If you attempt to over-engineer something of such complexity, you might just end up with Pyongyang instead of New York. Instead, we have a competing ecosystem of libraries and options with the good ones theoretically rising to the top. Better communities and communication of these values make this process work even better, just as in the greater economy. For all its complexity, this process works surprisingly well.<p>For all the explaining Kamp did in this article, the one thing he failed to account for was the resounding success of the current model. He did use a surprisingly apt metaphor, however. Cathedrals are no more; their old place as the center of society had to be explained by a series of myths and lies that placed ideals above reality. The thriving Bazaar easily replaced them at the center of any thriving modern city, based on the simple truth that the dynamic edge of reality was ever-changing, and that quality based on that reality would indeed be more successful.<p>Could it be better? Of course. But it is reality and truth that will move us forwardnot mythology. Good riddance to cathedrals.",1345470920

It's all out in the open - if anyone ever comes up with an actual problem with the code copy / paste, how hard can it be to fix it?<p>Matter of the fact is that the world doesn't have a critical mass of people with agreeing tastes and fundamentals to get them to come together and build something moderately complex.<p>What we do have however is a world full of reasonable people who just want to build something and make it work so they can solve some problem of theirs. There are also people who will happily reuse what the folks before them built - improving it in the process.<p>If we were to impose a high barrier to entry for people to code and design systems in absolute best possible way - we are effectively saying only a few will build software for the whole world. That'd be a net loss IMHO.<p>The point about bad design is worth arguing when software doesn't do what you want it to do, i.e. fails practice.

Node's npm I'd call out as a shining beacon of sanity, enabled by the best most popular code distribution format ever conceived: source distribution, coupled with a well defined not-completely-totally-batshit algorithm for looking for said sources when a program runs & at runtimes goes off to find it's dependencies:

4407495,comment,4407199,4407199,7,0,squonk,,,"I've become interested in evolutionary psychology. Not at all expert, but when one considers the survivability of children in ancient (pre-historic) environments, seems logical that children increased the likelihood of survival by mimicking the adults they see; figuring out how to do the basics like feeding themselves, finding a safe place to sleep, taking cover during inclement weather, and generally assimilating adult behavior. The sooner they learned these skills, the better their chance of survival if they became separated from adults. Evolution selected for such behaviors. 
That conclusion is a thought experiment, and I haven't dug up scientific evidence, so an anecdote: I once came home from work to find my 6 year old daughter in my closet. She had put on one of my shirts, a tie and my shoes. She was holding an old briefcase. When she saw me, she said, ""daddy, let's go do some business!"". I believe that kids have a genetically driven need to emulate their parents and that need is rooted in evolution and is much more profound than we realize. Regrettably, the modern parenting and schooling systems squelch that need.

I reported one or two clear issues upstream and they have been fixed, but until the relevant fixes arrive at the projects (especially PHP came with an old version of autotools), some time will pass.<p>As a counter-example, take i3-wm: it ships with a GNU Makefile (OK, multiple Makefiles in subdirectories, one for each tool) and compiles on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD. Now lets have a look at each of these:<p> NetBSD: No patches required to the makefiles:

It can track five fingers independently, each with up to a kilogram of effective force in precise 15-gram increments.  We got our fingers on one and were impressed by its potential.  We also checked out Synaptics' upcoming ThinTouch keyboard, which melds innovative switch tech with a side order of capacitive touch, and captured the low-latency ClearPad Series 4 touchscreen on our high-speed camera.",1345467799

However, to get me to switch from Things (or Remember the Milk, etc), it'll first need to match those offerings on all levels, and then offer a killer feature on top of that. (e.g. I'm in love with the Things iPhone app, so you'll have to match that level of design). Collaboration and analytics sound potentially very interesting though, so I'm curious to see where those go.<p>I sometimes question how much room there is for competition in the todo list space, but I guess competition is always a good thing.

4407319,story,,,12,7,inprogress,"Show HN:  Redline.cc, the easiest way to report visual bugs",,"As a developer, one of the biggest obstacles I've encountered has been how to communicate with designers - especially, when it comes to constructing their designs. Over the years, I have come to realize that Designers and Developers just see the world differently -   Developers see the world as defects in code text and Designers see the world as defects in pixels. This ""language barrier"" is what Redline (http://www.redline.cc) addresses -it allows Designers (or anyone really) to enter bugs visually and directly on the web page. Then, those mark-ups automatically creates a bug ticket in your bug tracking system (currently, we support Pivotal Tracker and JIRA).<p>My co-creator and I would love to get some feedback!

Of course I don't know how complex these pythonchallenges are going to become, but most of +Malattia's levels require a couple of hours or to be solved over days. You can solve the first few without programming skills, although they <i>do</i> help :) I forget how far I came with these, maybe level 6 or 7. Seems he lost accounts made before 2006, so I can't check for sure.<p>The site itself is pretty old (10 years, at least), so any hints that refer to external web resources/material might be long dead, and you either have to use archive.org or accept the additional challenge of finding other mirrors (I'm fairly confident most stuff must have been mirrored in some dusty corner of the web, since the ""scene"" that's behind these challenges were not so much ""reversers"" as they are ""+seekers"") (try googling for filenames, and such).<p>Good luck!

He doesn't consider websites that provide information to be non-free because the only processing done by the server is the transmission of information. He does however consider more complex websites such as SaaS portals and web apps to be non-free.<p>This is also not a very clean situation. For example, who owns the software, the webmaster or the user? Note that in case of desktop software the user always owns at least a license of the software even if only to run a compiled binary for a limited amount of time with restrictions. And further more unlike desktop software you are not running the software on your machine.<p>Does one have the right to demand the source and modification rights of a piece of software just because it is serving them information despite no processing their information and not running on their machine?<p>1. <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-s...</a>",1345467687

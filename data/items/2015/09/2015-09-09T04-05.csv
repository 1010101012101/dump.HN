I have a very wide IPD (Interpupillary Distance), which meant that I couldn&#x27;t focus cleanly on the image of the DK2. I experience some mild to moderate motion sickness when I use the DK2 in most titles.<p>However, there are some experiences -- particularly those with a cockpit or a third person camera -- that significantly reduce or eliminate the sickness. At PAX this year, I tested both the HTC Vive (Call of the Starseed -- a Myst-like title) and the Oculus CV1 (Eve Valkyrie -- a space superiority dogfighter) with absolutely no motion sickness at all, despite some rather hectic motion in Eve. Both demos were approximately 15 minutes of VR time. The higher frame rates and resolution, along with better accommodation of my wideset eyes absolutely improved the &#x27;presence&#x27; in the demo. It was absolutely a material change from the DK2, which I&#x27;ve shelved until the consumer ready hardware is available.<p>Additionally, DK1 and DK2 content is still generally content under development. We&#x27;re still learning which experiences are good or bad in VR, and how to move the player without disturbing their equilibrium. Games like Eve Valkyrie and Call of the Starseed were both designed from the ground up with VR in mind, which also helps.",1441774006

At one point, the paper says this:<p>> While the notion of a barter system implies a virtual currency could be created, this would require a global ledger to track ownership and transfer of the currency. This can be implemented as a BitSwap Strategy, and will be explored in a future paper.<p>So it kind of sounds like they need something like bitcoin, but don&#x27;t want it to be tightly coupled to bitcoin - which is probably smart. But without a single clear solution for a reliable BitSwap strategy (and I&#x27;m not sure how it could be reliable without a distributed global ledger of some kind), it&#x27;s hard to see how/why the necessary resources will be contributed to the IPFS network.",1441773492

It&#x27;s the same one as San Francisco: new denser construction is near impossible to get a permit for. If NYC permitted lots more housing to be built, the cost of housing would become affordable.<p>Tokyo does not have a housing availability problem. The vast majority of families in Tokyo live in single family homes they own close to parks and rail transit. The ratio of housing cost to family income in Tokyo is more like affordable Dallas or Atlanta than nightmarishly expensive NYC or SF.<p>How did Tokyo do it? It permitted lots and lots of by-right building on small lots, issued permits automatically for new homes, didn&#x27;t require any parking at all for every unit, platted out narrow streets, and built lots of rail transit at reasonable prices. There are few skyscrapers -- Tokyo&#x27;s density is 150 (people/hectare), only double SF&#x27;s average density and similar to North Beach, Pacific Heights, or Russian Hill.<p>It&#x27;s too late for SF to build narrow streets, but permitting multi-story rowhouse construction throughout the city could easily add a few hundred thousand units and substantially reduce housing prices.

I am very much in favor of restarting clinical trials as long as it's not abused. I think there might be great potential there and as long as we continue to stigmatize it, we will miss out on any knowledge we could gain from studying it. And even if it turns out to have no medicinal value at all, at least we'd know, rather than treating psychoactive drugs like poison. I mean, we have drugs now for treating fatigue in people who work long and irregular hours, why can't we at least give these compounds a real shot at proving whether or not they have value?",1308999515

Only in retrospect and only after they provoke major changes in the society does the society recognize them as some kind of heroes. But until that happens, they will be persecuted and some of them caught and treated like criminals. And I'm not saying they are completely innocent or anything. But all revolutionaries eventually provoke <i>some</i> damage. But that damage is insignificantly small compared to the changes they eventually cause.<p>Things are definitely getting really interesting, and I think this is just the beginning.

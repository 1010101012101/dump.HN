Most people are smart enough to know a patent that is just held isn't all that valuable. Killing a startup won't help a company that isn't really in the field.<p>Third, an extremely cynical patent lawyer tells me the whole system is extremely fungible. This might mean that you can get out of infringement easily.<p>Forth, have any others tried to go against the patent and failed?",1185915440

His post appears to demonize advertising in general.<p>Also, how can you say ""Buy stuff when the focus is on creating something valuable, not convincing you that something is valuable.""<p>The context is totally dependant on who the individual is.  Who is to stay something is valuable to other people?  It is the advertisements job to show to the potential customer why the product is valuable.  <p>Lastly, how does 'ignore manipulate ads' equate to 'buy stuff when the focus is on creating something valuable, not convincing you that something is valuable?  That is quite the jump.  <p>

38129,comment,38028,38028,0,0,brianmckenzie,,,"Starting a startup has led to big improvements for me in this area. Back when I worked for other people I was constantly buying stuff. Oh, the rationalizations I came up with for purchases of very dubious value. I felt that I had to have every piece of the puzzle, only I didn't realize that the puzzle can never be completed.<p>Now that I've gone out on my own I don't have the time or money to spend like this anymore. It's such a change for the better.<p>Here are some stuff-reduction techniques I use:<p>Books: I have one large Ikea bookshelf. Several of the shelves are reserved as a 'rotating collection' - when the shelf gets full, I make myself sell some books on Amazon before I get new ones. The collection can never exceed the capacity of the one decent-sized bookshelf.<p>Every August, I take an inventory of everything I own and how often I'm using it. This includes books, clothes, office supplies, everything. Everything gets divided into three categories based on usage: heavily used, not used at all, and marginal. I keep everything in the 'heavily used' category. I sell, give away, or throw away everything in the 'never used' category. Then, I make a list of everything in the 'marginal' category and keep it until the next year. If any given item is still 'marginal' the next year, I sell it.<p>You'd be surprised how effective this is. What's especially amazing is the crazy stuff you can sell over the net - someone paid 50 bucks for a t-shirt I hadn't worn in 15 years. Last year I made enough cash doing this to buy a new Mac. The reduction in clutter is even better.",1185914893
38128,comment,38028,38028,0,0,geebee,,,"I think we're in a transitional moment in history, where stuff has become close to free but we're still locked into a mentality that values it.  I don't think it'll be much longer before we come around to realizing it.<p>Funny that Paul should mention kids.  When my son was born, I was given a lot of plastic toys that make noise.  I've seen them on the shelves at ToysRUs, and they are remarkably cheap.  <p>Thing is, my parents and their friends (who are crossing 60 these days) came of age at a time when a toy was a rare and expensive treat.  They were generally made in the US, and required a lot of capital and first world labor.  A large room full of toys was a sign of the very well to do.  When they were kids, a new toy was a truly wonderful gift, and so they continue to give them.<p>And yet their houses were relatively cheap relative to their incomes. For 20 and 30-ish people, the great financial challenge is housing, not plastic toys.  So stuff is very cheap, but a place to put that stuff is prohibitively expensive.  <p>I have a feeling my 2 year old would really enjoy a toy workbench.  The item itself is awfully cheap, and I could probably get one for $25 on craigslist, but the real estate it's sitting on is worth about $2k.(I live in one of the few remaining unfashionable blocks of San Francisco for the low low price of about $650/sq ft- on nob or russian hill this workbench would probably cover closer to $10k worth of floorspace).   <p>So here's another way to test a purchase.  Think about how much floor space the item would cover, and ask yourself if it's worth the are*$/sqft.  ",1185914707

It is a very short distance, but for some it is a long way so they just go with the next best thing. In this vas that is down voting.

38119,comment,38028,38028,0,0,kcl,,,"Just a week or so ago I went through the process of getting rid of all my stuff. My main reason for doing so wasn't to free up space in my room, it was to free up space in my head. I'm down to approximately one suitcase full of things---I even tossed out the empty suitcase. You start out with a huge mental block against throwing things away, but every time you throw something out you actually feel better, and the more things you throw out the easier it becomes. Eventually I got down to the bare essentials: a toothbrush, a few changes of clothes, and a lockbox full of important personal effects like my passport and birth certificate. The things I didn't want to carry around but couldn't bear to throw away I shipped to my parents' house. In fact, I shipped one of the last boxes there this morning (old photographs, letters from friends, postcards).<p>If you have to ship a lot of books---are you really going to need your Sipser book anytime soon?---you can do it media mail for next to nothing.<p>This is something I've wanted to do for years and I can't tell you how relieving it is to finally do it. I'd like to get down the level of the monk with just a rice bowl, or a hobo with a sack tied to a stick, but really I can't give up things like nail clippers and deodorant and razorblades, and little things like that still manage to take up space. (How much? About another laptop-case sized container.) Of course, it helps to have saved up some money first so you know you could reacquire things if you turn out to need them later. Luckily the process of saving for my startup has given me enough to do that. When I was a student I could've never tossed out my hairdryer...that's another thirty bucks. What if I grow my hair out again? With a little money in your pocket you can let the drugstore keep all of these things for you. Durable goods become disposable. America is totally geared for this. Every time I moved I would go to Wal-Mart and buy a whole new collection of silverware.<p>One of the rules I used to use was to inspect my stuff before moving it out of an old place. If I hadn't used something in the previous year, chances are I wasn't going to use it in the next, and I'd throw it out. I found this to be a good way to reduce clutter. Of course, now I've gotten rid of a lot of things I did use in the previous year, I just found I didn't really need to use them anymore.<p>On the extreme side I've gotten rid of my bed, though that's perhaps the one thing I miss. Sleeping on the floor is hard. It's kind of invigorating in a way, though it's downright uncomfortable at times. I'm enjoying it now, but when I finally buy my own place I'll definitely be repurchasing a bed.<p>When you throw out your stuff you just feel better about your day, and when you get rid of things you really don't need, you find it simplifies your routine. When I wake up in the morning I spend less time primping and preening. I grab my laptop case and I head out to my workspace, and then I work without worrying whether I made my bed or if my dresser needs dusting. The experience is a lot like refactoring code. It's extremely liberating.<p>",1185913979

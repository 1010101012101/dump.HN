1056825,comment,1056456,1056456,0,0,Maro,,,"Real world usage: an event-based architecture like the one employed in Keyspace [1]. We have an abstract class Callable, which has a member virtual void Execute() and a global convenience function Call(Callable) which just calls ->Execute(). So a Callable is something that can be called, ie. a function pointer. We then have two concrete implementations, one for global (C) function pointers and one for class member (C++) function pointers. The whole thing is in Callable.h and is <100 lines of code, hence very lightweight.<p>Then, in the framework layer, we register callbacks using Callables in the IOProcessor. So if you create a TCP server with a TCP listening socket, you have a TCPRead object and you set its onComplete member, which is a Callable, to &TCPServer::OnConnect and analogously for onClose. Then, once a connection is establised you post TCPRead or TCPWrite objects for the new socket to IOProcessor to receive read notifications or perform writes, again with members onComplete and onClose.<p>Then, in the application layer you have actual database code which uses the network abstractions in the framework layer (which abstract away I/O), but they also use Callables to have themselves get called back when, for example an entire message has been read (eg. command is then parsed and executed) from the TCP stream or a client connection is terminated (eg. commands are canceled).<p>The whole program is then one big infinite loop, each iteration IOProcessor::Poll() being waken up by the O/S because something has happened, and Callables being called in turn. (On BSD, we kqueue, on Linux epoll and on Win32 Completion Ports to receive readyness notifications.) We also have support timers, which are just a linked list of Callables, and when IOProcessor::Poll() blocks we pass in the amount of time until the next timer must be executed as the timeout.<p>Or you can use libev/libevent, but they're not lightweight and will force you to do things their way.<p>[1] AGPL source is at <a href=""http://scalien.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scalien.com</a>",1263643143

1056809,comment,1056683,1056683,0,0,Raphael_Amiard,,,"i don't know. Taking a clojure example :<p><pre><code>    (defn say [word]
      (println ""You said""
               word))

This wouldn't be possible without fixed width. Now a lot of languages don't use that kind of indenting a lot, but in lisps it's mandatory.<p>Also fixed width ensures that you can write code and it will lay in the same way on other computers, regardless of what other fixed width font they're using. That's a big big point i think, since code is most of the time a collaborative effort",1263641896

1056807,comment,1056683,1056794,0,0,yungchin,,,"Agreed - I don't think the speed-limiting factor when reading code is how fast it transfers from screen to brain. That's totally different with prose, where you often skip over almost 90% of the characters because the choice of words that fit the context comes naturally - not quite the same for function call arguments...<p>A possible benefit of fixed-width: say you take a for-loop (which you can probably recognise even skipping over 95% of the characters) - now your brain wants to extract the indices at which it starts and ends: it seems to me a fixed-width font makes it easier to predict where you'll find the indices in the given line.

1056794,comment,1056683,1056683,0,0,soren,,,"""more text in an eye fixation"" is not necessarily a good thing for reading code, because code is semantically more dense than regular text. I think one will not be able to absorb all information and therefore not get a faster reading experience due to re-reading. I find the fixed-width font example easier to read, because it appears not as cramped as the proportional-width example, and I can easier get an overview of what the code does.",1263640504
1056791,comment,1055194,1056051,0,0,ephermata,,,"Dictating letters is still niche and will likely remain so, except for people who have severe RSI or other reasons to go through the training required. If I'm spending enough time at one sitting to do a letter, and if I have the investment in learning how to touch type, then I'm a lot faster at typing than dictating. Even if the dictation is perfect.<p>On the other hand, voice recognition for specialized vocabularies is happening. I've noticed a progressive replacement of ""push 1 for X, push 2 for Y"" with voice interfaces in support calls. My car has voice recognition for the sound system that actually works, e.g. ""Play Track Shelter"" plays a song of that name. While there are still freaky behaviors, these work well in that they don't waste my time when I'd rather be doing something else -- like having my problem fixed or listening to Icon of Coil. Because they are for specific narrow domains, these applications of voice recognition coexist with my typing, touch, et al.<p>Put another way, new UIs and input devices seem to work best when they have a path for incremental adoption. It's rare to see a complete overnight change. Even the iPhone, as amazing and revolutionary as it is, built on pre-existing experience with touch screen phones. (Maybe ""reacted against"" is a better term than ""built on."") Plus the iPhone still has a keyboard, even if it's a neat touchscreen one instead of a hardware one.",1263640227

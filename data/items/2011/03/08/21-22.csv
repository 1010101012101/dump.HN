2302749,comment,2300802,2301765,0,0,wnoise,,,"Don't pull.  Pull is two operations -- fetching the upstream work, and merging it in to your current branch.  It's true that CVS and SVN both let you do this with dirty trees, but it's generally not what you should really be doing.  Merges are hard and every update from ""upstream"" merged into your local changes has a chance of breaking your local changes.<p>""git fetch"" and ""git remote update"" both let you do the fetch  without the merge.  Once you have the updates, you can then decide what to do with them, which may have lots more options than just a simple implicit merge that most tools provide: rebase, overwrite, ignore for now and handle later when your work is in a cleaner state, etc.<p>Git has tools to manage this in the case of long running lines of development.  Providing them for uncommitted changes is a much harder task (precisely because you can't name your work and roll back to it), and mostly <i>unnecessary</i> because commits are so lightweight.  This is your fundamental issue with git -- commits still feel heavyweight to you.<p>Git's model really is fundamentally not ""get everybody's local changes working with the exact same upstream code"" (indeed for the <i>upstream</i> author, they may trust their code far more than the code they are pulling).  Instead it is closer to ""let everybody pick what changes and history to use in order to create their own coherent source"".  DVCS means each developer chooses what history to treat as authoritative.  As such, temporary commits, temporary branches, and rewriting unshared history are encouraged.",1299621520

In theory, nothing stops you from creating a thread to do some background task (or EM.defer), but then you're on your own to make sure you have all the right synchronization logic.<p>As far as middleware goes, because you are reusing the same ""app chain"" between multiple requests, you just have to make sure that your middleware does not rely on any instance variables since those will get clobbered by other requests. Check the wiki page on middleware, we have a few examples around this.<p>Last but not least.. the EM reactor runs on a single core, so you're basically in the same deployment scenario as Thin or node.js. Having said that (always a caveat! ;)), Goliath <i>can</i> run on JRuby and Rubinius.. so in theory we have non-GILed environments there, which means we can start multiple reactors and run across multiple cores from within the same proc.

While they are entrepreneurial, they are not oriented around angel investing / venture capital to the same extent than places like San Francisco.  This is because they have government funding and government contracts in lieu of private funding.<p>Now, obviously there is still a significant amount of VC funding in Reston, but government money plays the role that initial incubator money might in other regions.  I, for instance, worked briefly at a startup that was developing technology spun off from a DARPA initiative.  My uncle, a VC, was a Vice President there.<p>Like most things in and around Washington DC, the presence of the federal government changes the political/economic/social/cultural environment in ways that you won't see in other parts of the country.<p>Baltimore makes more sense, because there's a greater need for startup cash and startup cash will have a greater effect here, since it's not going to be crowded out by government money.",1299621215

People keep telling us we got really lucky, but the impact on sleep and personal time has not been that huge.<p>During my wife's pregnancy, I had a big development project eating up 90%-95% of my free time: I wanted to get it done before he arrived, anticipating the huge time suck everyone warned me about. (I ended hitting the finish line, and deployed over the two-week paternity leave, and let him push the launch button when he was 8 days old.)<p>In my experience -- and again, YMMV, etc. -- if you can regiment your time carefully, it's absolutely not that big a deal. Yes, our days are substantially different now, but we work together really well to relieve each other; I get plenty of development time, she gets plenty of roller derby time, and after completing the post-deploy piece of my last project, I've already picked up another major project and am getting things done.<p>I've always been a pretty light sleeper, and it's not uncommon for me to be woken up at 4 and just not go back to sleep, so perhaps I already could deal with mild sleep deprivation well, but I really have no complaints about the amount of sleep we're getting. Generally I'll take the last feeding of the night, since I probably won't go back to sleep after, and there were a couple days in there where I dragged a bit, but really, the impact has been negligible.<p>(The impact of him coming home sick from daycare is an entirely different story. It's like he's a breeder reactor for bugs. I haven't been that sick in years.)<p>The best way I found to take care of my wife is to get her what she wants, when she wants it -- i.e., literally stand up before she's finished her request and go take care of it, stat. She's in a ton of discomfort (both before and after pregnancy, especially if you're doing a natural birth) and will appreciate the hell out of you going the extra mile. Post-birth, being instantly ready to locate/retrieve/position whatever baby paraphernalia or etc. has been a big help to her. Before we gravitated to a nice he-eats-then-we-eat schedule, I used to feed her and myself both as she fed the baby. Felt silly the first time but it worked out great logistically.<p>Some random bits in no particular order...<p>Interesting baby hack: one time the boy was crying, and just holding him wasn't doing the trick, so I figured his diaper needed changing. As a rule, his crying increases dramatically when first laid down for the diaper change, then he perks up and stops crying after he's cleaned up. So I laid him down, took off his diaper, and found that it was actually clean. When I re-diapered him and picked him up, he stopped crying... even though he didn't need the diaper change in the first place. I think if we could find out what was going on in their little brains, we'd be pretty surprised.<p>Totally invest in the mechanical swing kerben mentions.<p>When nothing else works, a warm bath has proven to be an awesome baby-fixer for us.<p>You will learn many new ways to care about poop.",1299619772

AFAIK (which isn't much), usually the distinction between regular, context-free, context-sensitive and recursively-enumerable languages turns on the power of the recognizer rather than the power of the language to express functions. In other words, the languages are limited in their syntactic expressivity but not their semantic expressivity. I've always understood the latter to be the key to determining the computational power.

2302600,comment,2301087,2301419,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"(IANAL)<p>Great summary of <i>Eldred v. Ashcroft</i>. I was very interested in that case and when I first listened I thought Lessig was going to bring the constitutional principle back to the individual's relationship with the law, and was disappointed that he didn't. By that I mean the idea that since 95 years exceeds a typical human lifespan, so few people would ever experience the limits of copyright terms (in relation to a work created during their own lives, with which they would have a different relationship than some historical work) that the phrase 'for limited times' would be robbed of meaning and undermine the public's respect for constitutional government. It was like listening to a concert pianist give a stirring performance of a great work, only to omit the final chord that would have resolved the piece...and usually I'm inclined towards the dry technical argument rather than the emotionally satisfying one.<p>Meantime, I'm very torn on this EFF brief. I completely agree with the general points they are making about Congressional overreach and the numerous avoidable problems that will result, and the brief also deftly highlights broader problems - like photographs of unknown copyright, depicting buildings which no longer exist. That libraries are unwilling to take the risk of exposing themselves to legal liability for materials like this leaves us all poorer, and highlights the severe weaknesses in the current copyright regime.<p>I have two problems, though. One is just a quibble; when underscoring copyright's ultimate purpose of '[promoting] the Progress of science and useful arts,' (brief p17), the decisions cited to support the activity of libraries concern the scope of copyright but are here reapplied to the idea of limited time. This ends up seeming tautological - if limited times are supported by findings of limited scope, but the findings of limited scope are derived by the idea of limited time, how is this not a general problem with the copyright act rather than with section 514 in particular? It seems as if the EFF should be arguing to expand the scope of fair use to protect all library activity, and doubly so when the brief, at pains not to contradict the court's ruling in <i>Eldred</i>, virtually endorses CTEA on the following page. It's a smart argument, but I can't help feeling it's a bait-and-switch.<p>The other problem is a more general, moral one - it's not wrong, but I don't like it. Russian works produced prior to 1973 had no copyright protection in the US, because the USSR was not a signatory to any copyright treaties. Thus, all pre-1973 material was in the public domain as far as US copyright was concerned. Section 514 of the UAA reverses that, takes things out of the public domain, and I agree that this is a big problem for the many people who had come to rely on the copyright-free nature of these and similar works. The EFF is quite right to point out the harm and the legal contradictions: as far as I can tell they're 100% correct about this and should win for that reason.<p>What I don't like is that it feel pretty unfair to Russian artists: 'Wrote a book, or recorded a song, or painted a picture prior to 1973? well then it's in the public domain, you don't get any royalties because you were thoughtless enough to be born in a communist country with whom we had no treaty. Too bad, so sad.' You'll notice the brief doesn't talk about 'the US public domain' or 'the American public domain' - there is just 'the public domain,' as if US copyright protection (or lack thereof) is the global standard for whether authors and publishers may claim ownership in creative works. And given the reality of mass media and internet publishing, this is actually a reasonable practical yardstick. If you live in France, and some work is in the public domain in the US but not in Europe, theoretically you do not have completely free access to it. But as a practical matter, if something has already fallen into the public domain in the US it's very difficult to defend the copyright in other places.<p>Congress added section 514, granting retroactive protection to works in this situation, because otherwise foreign governments doesn't have much incentive to uphold American copyrights. They could just say 'well, your stuff was in the public domain according to our laws so now it belongs to everyone - too bad, so sad.' American copyright holders wouldn't want that, since they'd lose a lot of foreign revenue - and so Congress suddenly yanked material back out of the public domain and declared it subject to copyright again. This is, of course, unfair to ordinary people who had previously enjoyed the use of those works for free, and are now asked to pay. One wonders if it might not have been better and fairer for Congress to just buy up the rights as a thank-you to all the foreign artists and publishers who never saw any reward for their creativity.<p>I think ultimately this case will come down to balancing the idea of 'limited times' against the value of 'securing..rights' and trying to decide which imperative is more important in the context of the United States' treaty obligations (don't forget that treaties stand on equal footing with the Constitution, per article 6). My hunch is that the Supreme Court will maintain the status quo and allow the retroactive grant of copyright to stand.<p>Overturning the copyright system will have to wait for better legislation (not much hope there) or a better case against the length of copyright terms. this case feels too limited to provide real reform; even if the EFF wins it will be a hollow victory because virtually all the existing problems with an outdated system copyright will continue unchanged. A constitutional challenge will have to show the injustice of the copyright system in relation to all creative work, not just a smallish subset that happened to be published in the wrong place at the wrong time and were thus excluded by chance.",1299618572

Here's the comment from antirez:<p><pre><code>    What changed since this article was written:\n    1) The Server structure in the unstable branch is finally divided into sections using comments.\n    2) The command table is now loaded into an hash table, so the lookup is now O(1) and it is possible to alter the hash table at runtime. This is how we implement ed the command renaming and shadowing in redis.conf.\n    3) The shared integers are not used when diskstore is enabled, since we need tha t every object is independent with a different LRU timestamp and so forth. But o therwise using the default mode of operations (in memory) shared integers are us ed.\n    4) Databases are now watched for the implementation of ""WATCH"" using a better AP I, that is signalModifiedKey().\n    5) Now we listen to the TCP socket and to Unix socket if configured. The Redis C luster branch (not public) will also listen to an additional TCP port using for cluster message passing.\n    7) Loading data from disk to memory is now non blocking, we do this re-entering the event loop while loading data.\n    8) Response reading is now faster and cleaner code, thanks to Pieter's work.\n    This is a very nice overview. Of course only the surface is covered, there are a lot more things going on in the specific commands, in VM / diskstore command (by far the most complex part of Redis), in specially encoded data types, and in rdb/AOF loading/saving, incrementally expanding hash tables, ...\n    In just 30k lines of code there is already a lot to take in mind!\n    Basically I and Pieter already reached the point where we are experts in different areas. We both understand the whole Redis codebase, but for instance he is more expert in the sorted sets and special encoding code, I'm more expert in the diskstore things, and so forth.</code></pre>",1299618441

I agree these won't be built with the full range of default kernel drivers. Perhaps when I said a ""broad range"" I should have said something like ""quite a few"". Never the less, most of these devices will be built with a variety of usb storage drivers since that's the purpose of the usb port. I know for a fact that the Sony Blu-ray contains an impressive number of wireless lan drivers in addition to the storage drivers. The Chumby contains a variety including serial and wired lan. The ASUS router supports many mass storage options as well as parallel and serial printer support. The boxee box is reported to even include mouse and keyboard support as well as mass storage support, and I'd wager they left a lot more than that on.<p>Which isn't to say that any of these devices have this driver built in, I simply don't know.  My point was more to raise the issue of what happens when a bug is discovered that affects one or more of these devices - many of which have a pretty large local attack surface. The answer is generally it stays vulnerable until you replace it, with the less similar it is to a PC the more likely that is to be true.<p>I wouldn't bet on many of these devices having stack smashing protection turned on. Look at how few linux distros have it turned on by default.",1299618010

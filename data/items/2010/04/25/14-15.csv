1292799,comment,1292612,1292726,0,0,DrJokepu,,," <i>Delegates ... are essentially just syntactic sugar for a one-method class</i><p>No that's not entirely true. There are a lot of similarities but there are essential differences as well. Delegates in .NET are truly functions as first class objects while single-method anonymous classes is Java are first class object wrappers around functions. This means that while in Java an anonymous class is a tuple with a reference to the instance of the anonymous class and a reference to the instance of the container class, in .NET it is a tuple with a reference (pointer actually) to a method and a reference to the instance of the owner class (if not static).<p>This is a subtle but important difference and is entrenched all the way down in the .NET type system, not just on syntax level.",1272207422

I suppose it should be no surprise--television was hailed at its invention as a medium for education and culture even though within years it degenerated into an endless stream of fixed quiz shows and formulaic sitcoms. And now personal computers are for most people more of a distraction and an impediment to creativity than they are any help.<p>Maybe it's right to be cynical--new technology can't reach a mass market without turning into just another form of television, because the mass of people won't create no matter what. I just wish that making computers accessible to more people meant giving more people the creative potential that this guy had in 1982, rather than just giving them another television with 500 channels of cute kitty pictures with amusing subtitles.",1272207378

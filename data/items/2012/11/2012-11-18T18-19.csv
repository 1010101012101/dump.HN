The basic premise is that a string the length of a domain name routinely, albeit rarely, gets corrupted by one bit, causing errant DNS lookups. Then it's reasonable to assume that a longer string is even more likely to contain corruption. But if that's so, why do I almost never see any evidence of bit corruption in my web server logs? Surely the same corruption would affect other parts of the URL, and the probability should be greater due to the length. But I can't find a single example in my logs that can't be explained by human error (typos by users or developers). If bit corruption is so overwhelmingly prevalent in hostnames, but not URLs or other identifiers, I suspect it's due to a software bug somewhere.",1353264999

And year after year, people have to point out that running a conference while paying no attention to diversity will (a) ensure that your conference fails to represent whatever diversity <i>already</i> exists in your community, and (b) do nothing to encourage further diversity in your community.

4801192,comment,4799695,4800112,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Interesting comment, I don't think of myself of as 'defending' the practice so much as picking apart the original author's argument.<p>The original author is claiming injury [1] based on the available space of the disk in a 128G Lenovo Voyager not being 128GB. On its face that is a silly claim because you have to have some space for other things like the OS and tools. Further no laptop that ships with a 128GB  with any OS today gives you, the user 128GB of space to play with. So really the argument would have to rest on the delta between the space available on a completely 'cleaned' machine (all crapware deleted) and a 'fresh' machine.<p>So if the author really needed 128GB of space, they should get the 256GB Voyager 13, since the additional 128GB all is available to the user. Then regardless of the weird partitioning he isn't injured.<p>Now the author could have talked about value, the cost of the device versus the available space and compared that to other models, the author could have talked about system performance, or any number of things but instead they make this claim that 40 - 50Gb of available space is a 'ruined user experience'. Which doesn't seem well supported by his argument. It could be supported by market acceptance but that remains to be seen.<p>As for my feelings on the practice of stuffing all this stuff into the machine, I expect that to sort itself out by people not buying the small disk machine. But of the choice of having a less expensive machine that I spend some time deleting crapware from and having a more expensive machine? I'll take the cheaper one. I may certainly be in a minority there.<p>[1] The injury claim is for ""ruining the user experience""",1353264768

4801160,comment,4800972,4800972,18,0,peteforde,,,"I was the curator and co-organizer of RubyFringe and FutureRuby in Toronto. I'm really sorry to hear that folks organizing BRC felt so beat down by negativity that cancelation was the best option. Most people simply do not appreciate the hundreds of unpaid hours of work that are required to pull off a good event.<p>Several aspects of this controversy don't sit well with me, however. First off, since when does the curation of a conference have to follow someone else's value system? It's very simple: the people that organize an event should work hard to put together the most interesting line-up they can. It's then up to the potential attendees to decide if the event is worth their time to attend. That's it; there are no more rules!<p>If you want to solicit proposals for talks, go ahead. If you like some of them, give them a shot at speaking. If you decide that none of them match your curatorial agenda, then thank them warmly for their submission and move on. You aren't obligated to take proposals at all, and you're certainly not obligated to make your decision process transparent or part of some laborious community democracy. In fact, I would guess that one strongly opinionated curator will put together a far more coherent line-up than any popularity contest ever could. If you're looking for inspiration, consider asking attendees from previous years if they'd like to consider ""leveling-up"" to speaker.<p>When I put together our speaker lists, it wasn't arbitrary and much like test driven development we didn't just start emailing random smart people. We started with strong themes for the entire event, ideals that could pull together folks and be both entertaining and challenging. Those themes directed our branding, our choice of talks and the after-hours entertainment, which in our world is just as vital to the conference experience as anything else.<p>Not all meritocracy is bad. Conference curation is one such domain where winning has far more to do with subject diversity, pacing and the element of surprise than arbitrary quotas for gender, race, age or class ever could.<p>I'd say that the best metaphor for future curators to use is building a deck of Magic the Gathering cards. You need the right balance of mana, summon and sorcery cards. There are five colors but to be effective you choose 1 or perhaps 2 at most. And most importantly, you design your deck around a theme which is based on a hypothesis for winning which you think brings something new to the table. Most of the strategy for winning at MtG happens before game play starts, and if everyone had a say in how you built your deck, it wouldn't be very fun to play with such an unnecessarily shitty deck. You could call it the ""Stop Hitting Yourself!"" deck.<p>There's a difference between fighting for a developer community free of sexist bullshit, and pretending that a conference built on arbitrary values for diversity is automatically better than one where you nail a theme and everyone leaves happy. Those who disagree are likely to simply skip my conferences, and that's perfectly fine.<p>Finally, we did both of those events with no sponsorships. We cost less than an O'Reilly-backed RailsConf event and we provided logo-free swag, great wifi, amazing food, three nights of entertainment with an open bar and we helped speakers with travel and lodging while still managing to break even. It's simply not true that you can't do a successful conference without sponsors. You just have to charge money to attend, and be prepared to help those who are having financial issues find ways to volunteer.<p><a href=""http://www.rubyinside.com/rubyfringe-success-and-roundup-956.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rubyinside.com/rubyfringe-success-and-roundup-956...</a><p><a href=""http://unspace.ca/blog/rubyfringe-what-now"" rel=""nofollow"">http://unspace.ca/blog/rubyfringe-what-now</a><p><a href=""http://railspikes.com/2008/7/27/rubyfringe-recap-and-slides"" rel=""nofollow"">http://railspikes.com/2008/7/27/rubyfringe-recap-and-slides</a><p>RubyFringe and FutureRuby are two of the things in my life that I am most proud of.

4801085,comment,4800972,4800972,12,0,mgkimsal,,,"Having just finished a conference yesterday - <a href=""http://indieconf.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indieconf.com</a> - I feel like throwing in a few words on speaker selection.  OK, maybe a whole bunch, as I blogged about this a couple weeks ago:<p><a href=""http://indieconf.com/2012/how-does-a-conference-select-speakers/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://indieconf.com/2012/how-does-a-conference-select-speak...</a><p>For my perspective, the idea of <i>only</i> opening up a call for speakers and just 'picking the right ones' doesn't work very well.  Or at least, I don't think it works very well for conferences just starting off which don't have a lot of reputation to fall back on.  Borrowing some of this reputation by getting some 'superstar' speakers might help a bit, but if you do that before a CFS, you've already done some preselection.<p>From year one, I had a call for speakers process open, but I also had some particular speakers I wanted to talk on specific topics.  I had probably half the speakers/topics nominally on board (not officially at that point) during the first year CFS, and fleshed out the rest of the slots with submissions - some of which were really good angles I hadn't thought of.<p>However, imo, the role of a conference organizer is largely curation of an experience, and you have to have an idea of what you want that experience to look like early on.  And for me, gender is a factor - it's not a major one, but I made sure to encourage some females in my network to submit.  At the same time, there were some submissions and applications from females that I didn't bring on board the conference this year, because they didn't quite fit the vibe I was shooting for.<p>Anyhow, sorry to see they've cancelled this.  I know all too well how hard it is to organize something, and to be discouraged enough to pull the plug like this was certainly not fun or easy for the organizers.  I wish them luck in future projects like this.<p>EDIT: Couple more thoughts - how you run the event the first year has an impact on how people view your event in subsequent years.  I get props every year on the food, but mostly because I take the extra 10 minutes to organize vegan and gluten-free options, and I get people coming back partially based on the fact that I've done that (had people buy tickets and tell me that).

4801065,comment,4800856,4800961,12,0,microarchitect,,,"When a case is brought in front of the police, they have a fair amount of discretion in terms of the actions they want to take next. For example, they could decide to arrest the suspect and put him/her in ""judicial custody"" if they determine that s/he would be a threat to the public based on what they have seen in complaint. Now if you're arrested on Friday evening it won't be until Monday that a judge will hear your bail application. So you're guaranteed to spend a few days in jail. And then there are legal loopholes you can exploit that can ensure that the bail application isn't heard on Monday. When such things are effectively done people could spend a week or two or even more in jail. All this is because the police and the judiciary have a fair number of discretionary powers each of which all have perfectly reasonable justifications.<p>I would guess that the person in this case involved got on the wrong side of a important political or bureaucratic entity and they pulled strings to make sure the discretionary powers were used in specific ways after filing a ""bogus"" complaint. If the police were behaving honestly, they should have told the complainant to bugger off, but because there were important people showing ""interest"" they didn't.<p>My guess is that this sort of thing is really nothing unique to India. It's just that the people who exploited in such ways in the US (to pick a familiar example) would likely be poor immigrants, young black males etc. who lack the connections required to get their stories heard. Perhaps one important difference is that politicians seem to have a lot of leverage over police authorities in India.",1353261609

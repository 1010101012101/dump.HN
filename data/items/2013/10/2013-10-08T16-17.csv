The ToS do mention that they are &#x27;...all for use in conjunction with Nest hardware products&#x27; so I&#x27;m not trying to be deliberately misleading in claiming that they relate to the operation of the smoke alarm.<p>I&#x27;m sure that Nest don&#x27;t mean anything bad but the ToS and its legal reach is far from clear.

Superficially need some minimal level of education/civilization.  Which merely excludes those bored by formal education, most of whom are idiots and a small fraction of them are geniuses.  For lack of a better idea you could use some weighted GPA/IQ/GRE/SAT/ACT score system.  Assuming the smartest people are those who come up with the best ideas.  It does seem that to spread an idea you need a smart dude but a think tank should hire marketing people for that?  Perhaps a lotto would work just as well for selection.  A lotto instead of elections would likely give us a superior government, perhaps it would give us superior ideas on average.<p>Another interesting example is the Institute for Advanced Studies nearby Princeton, I think.

Unfortunately the approach taken in this instance is the reverse &#x27;guilty until proven innocent&#x27; or worse &#x27;guilty and that&#x27;s it&#x27;.<p>Yes, property seizures, arrests, etc. can happen as part of due process however there are complicated legalities associated with those things. For example, you actually need a court order to make an arrest (an arrest warrant) or a warrant to seize property. Getting a court involved means you have to prove something as well, or have enough evidence. Furthermore, other things such as danger to safety, security, flight risk, etc. are all considered by the judge.<p>I guess that&#x27;s where due process is being totally skipped here. There is no court order, no warrant, just a threatening letter without any formal basis.",1381251404

Had you asked me what it was though, I couldn&#x27;t have said; I&#x27;d had to have been sitting in front of a keyboard to type it.<p>Three nights ago I logged in as usual, then nodded off. I woke up ~30 mins later and tried to type it again...but couldn&#x27;t!  I was surprised, but figured it would come back to me in the morning. Several days now and nothing. This is incredibly frustrating for me as a geek who has lived most of his life electronically -- these 15 years represent a huge volume of my life product: passwords to online accounts, thoughts and computer programs I&#x27;ve written, illustrations, mathematical models, recorded conversations... So much of my world is locked away in there.<p>I know brute forcing holds no hope, nor is my recovery key stored with Apple. I have backups that are encrypted with the same password, because I was protecting from fire/theft/drive failure, not this.<p>So I&#x27;m not looking for computer advice, but rather help on recovering information from my brain that I <i>know</i> must still be in there, somewhere.

They borrow about 0.5 extra per year (which is why the budget ceiling needs to go up).<p>If the US wanted to instantly achieve a balanced budget, they would have to spend 3/5ths the current amount. When a government cuts the amount it spends, it shrinks the economy, and reduces tax take.<p>In the UK, a limited form of this strategy seems to be working, but in Southern Europe, a strong &#x27;austerity&#x27; strategy is creating a spiral of reducing tax take (requiring ever greater cuts).<p>So the sharp reduction in the deficit you mention is not possible. It would need to be gradual.<p>The elephant in the room is that, in the US, China, and Europe, the aging population is coming. As the proportion of contributors to consumers of public spending shifts, more debt is inevitable.

Multiple hypothesis testing is built into the design of the studies, and has been from the very start. When it comes to proper interpretation of stats in science, geneticists are at the top of the hierarchy.<p>Your second point is far closer to what I think is going on, but I still think that single-gene studies are the wrong way to go, as you might guess from my username.  They&#x27;re testing for the wrong thing, single locus or single gene causes, of a very complex phenotype with the involvement of many many different loci and genes.  So if there are 500-600 genes that are important, maybe one passes the test in your particular subsample, but in a different subsample the rest of the 500-600 genes mediate the effect. I.e. there&#x27;s not enough complexity in the model to account for the signal. What&#x27;s worked very well for simple diseases and traits may not work well for complex traits with the influence of many many different genes.",1381250796

Example<p><i>For the modeling
underlying twin studies to make sense, one has
to assume that the environments experienced by
identical twins raised in the same family are no
more similar than those experienced by frater-
nal twins, that genes and environments are
independent and additive (again, in the usual
ANOVA sense) in the determination of the trait,
and that parents mate randomly with respect to
the trait. </i><p>That&#x27;s totally true.  If you compared an organism with a randomly generated genome to a human and exposed both to what would be a normal range of environments for a human, you would find that all traits are entirely genetic.  And if you selected people from the normal range of human genetics but only gave half of them access to important things like a uterus then you would find that all traits are almost entirely environmentally determined.  So you can&#x27;t say that &quot;Trait Foo is 50% heritable&quot; unless you also specify the populations and range of environments you&#x27;re talking about.<p>EDIT:  Or you could say that heritability is ordinal but not cardinal, given some reasonable assumptions.",1381250763

The best and brightest in a given contracting firm are dedicated to pursuing new work.  I work for a contractor, and my fun IT projects are all proof of concept items.  Stellar execution simply isn&#x27;t rewarded.  The gov&#x27;t puts idiots in charge of things: not idiots in the sense that they aren&#x27;t smart, but idiots in the sense that they have no expertise in anything.  They are hired for paper qualifications (ever heard of a Project Management Professional cert?  It&#x27;s what they hire, and its useless), and the bright/motivated ones move on to interesting work, perhaps in other parts of the gov&#x27;t, or the private sector. I built a great tool, using all open source technology for the gov&#x27;t once.  I built it in 3 weeks (it is now officially gov&#x27;t owned software), and it replaced an $80K piece of software (commercial off the shelf) that was inadequate for the task.  My reward was complaints that the security people weren&#x27;t familiar with Postgres, and an immediate request to migrate to Oracle.  There was no functional reason for this, but I complied after the gov&#x27;t shelled out huge sums of money for Oracle license.  Why?  Because paper pushing idiots in the gov&#x27;t are in charge of IT security, and their credentials for the job are based entirely on passing certification tests.  Their entire incentivization at their job is to minimize their own workload, rather than maximize the happiness of their gov&#x27;t customers.<p>Do you think anybody who could even guage whether proper testing was being performed or not was in charge of this project from the gov&#x27;t level?

Venture capital won&#x27;t make you suddenly sing in key.
Venture capital won&#x27;t inspire you to write compelling lyrics.
Venture capital doesn&#x27;t have anything at all to do with musical talent and I think most people would agree that the overwhelming majority of &quot;VC&quot; supported artists are chosen by record companies based on ROI, not based on their musical merit. Today more than ever, the cost of producing and distributing quality music is easily within the range of most serious musicians; the software available to musicians today is staggering and quality recording equipment becomes cheaper all the time.<p><i>The schedules of musicians do not align with the modern working world. Employers do not look highly on people who take 8 weeks off to tour. In order to make money touring, you have to be pretty well established..</i><p>Give me a break. If you&#x27;re not big enough to make money touring then sorry, you have to get a job like the rest of us; this is not something unique to musicians, how do you think employers feel about a 6 month sabbatical dedicated to working on your ultimate app idea? It&#x27;s not gonna happen. The majority of startups don&#x27;t have access to VC money, and the capital going to many successful early stage startups are (relatively) paltry sums that a determined individual could absolutely accumulate.<p><i>Also, unlike software development, there is no &#x27;day job&#x27; that musicians can work while saving to bootstrap their own venture</i><p>There is no law that says musicians have to work low-paying temp jobs. There is no reason why musicians are any more economically disadvantaged than any other individual who has to work full time while building towards their personal goals on the side. The implication seems to be that musicians generally have no other useful skills besides waiting tables, but that is obviously false.<p><i>Practice does not make you a good stage performer.</i><p>What? <i>Every</i> good performer practices within an inch of their life, even Beethoven had to put in the hours, the debatable exceptions are too rare to be worth consideration.<p><i>It is ultimately a dying art form and those that don&#x27;t see that and in fact argue the opposite, don&#x27;t have any inkling of what is actually going on.</i><p>That&#x27;s a pretty presumptuous and condescending assertion.

The US (department of homeland security, no less!) started seizing domains about 2 years ago. They went and basically took down any domain that was related to large scale piracy (demonoid) or counterfeit goods (sites that sold fake gucci bags, that kind of stuff..). The other kind of site that they targeted were mostly sports streaming sites (ones that streamed ESPN, etc.).<p>It was obvious that the UK would follow soon enough seeing that such a thing was entirely possible. Of course when the US seized a spanish website (rojadirecta) domain, they were challenged in court and lost. [0] There were also several other incorrect seizures where the US government ended up seizing sites that had nothing to do with any illegal activity and then returning them a year later [1]. This is what happens when you ignore due process.<p>Most small service providers and ISPs feel threatened when a big government like the US comes after them. Unless they have properly defined protocols for dealing with this kind of stuff, the support rep will probably buckle under pressure and hand over the data.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve seen instances where domain registrars are often requested for private registration data without court orders or any sort of legal basis. Some registrars hand out the data. Some registrars email their customers asking them to transfer away (so stop being our customers) to continue protecting their privacy. Some registrars actually have the guts to say no. It really varies.<p>We&#x27;re certainly at a point now where governments can easily coerce internet businesses to bend to their will.

Tons of it. Cache as much as you can. Memcache and Varnish are your friends, use them as much as you can. Unfortunately, if Healthcare.gov was in a very write-heavy situation, they are somewhat limited in how much caching will help.<p>One thing they could have done that would have saved A TON of load is not require users to sign up before giving them a list of available plans. That whole part didn&#x27;t need to be database driven at all. The data could have been stored in redis and they could have used javascript to filter it based on a form. That would have been ridiculously fast. They also could have prerendered all the plan list possibilities and stored those in varnish. That also would have been ridiculously fast. My guess is millions of people just wanted to check prices and eliminating the database load for those users would have probably kept things running fast and smooth.<p>Slow DB queries are the enemy and you don&#x27;t realize how bad they are until you are at scale. Sure, it only takes a few seconds on your local machine, but multiply that times thousands of concurrent users and your DB gets swamped. If you are using an ORM, it is MUCH harder to track down where in your code that 3 way join that scans every record is happening. Ideally you&#x27;d be using straight SQL and maybe use comments to tag a query. Also tools like newrelic might help if only because many databases don&#x27;t offer great visibility of performance data.<p>Sharding your database is something that is probably possible, and in the case of healthcare.gov, they probably could have had totally separate infrastructure on a per-state basis that would have made scaling a lot easier than putting everything on the same database. Also, put reporting and things that aren&#x27;t mission critical on a slave database. The last thing you want is a reporting job bringing down the live site in the background.<p>Getting good hardware with fast IO is going to save a lot of developer time required to scale things. Using fast SSD&#x27;s is probably the easiest win to speed up your database. Developer time costs a lot more than hardware and giving yourself cheap headroom up front gives you breathing room on launch.<p>Performance testing is also something worth doing, but the tricky part is until you roll out, it is hard to know exactly where the hotspots are going to be. In this case, new user signup would be the obvious place to test, so they probably should have tested up to the limits of their servers and tried to extrapolate an expected number of users and maybe increased that by 1.5x or something to have some leeway.<p>On a rollout where you don&#x27;t know what you are getting into user wise, being on a cloud where you can scale out fast as demand requires is something worth doing. They could have saved a lot of bad press and headache by being on the cloud initially and migrating to less hardware after the initial peak died down.<p>There are a ton of little things like that you have to think about if you are dealing with massive scale. I don&#x27;t know if the engineers building healthcare.gov had ever dealt with something like this before, but I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re learning these lessons now.",1381249802

Multiverse theories make two assumptions: 1. There is as much Matter as anti-matter, and thus you could nullify the entire universe. 2. Every coefficient of Gravity/Time/Magnetism/Universal force is represented in a multiverse and those verses don&#x27;t interact.<p>The universe&#x27;s size is &quot;larger than observable but not infinite&quot;.  The Universe expands at the rate of the maximum traversable speed. So even if you started towards the edge at the moment of the bang you can&#x27;t ever reach the edge. That is different than infinite.  But as humans we tend to say infinite for anything that is bigger than fits in our head.  Just like in Algebra when you say a function approaches infinity. X divided by 0 is never actually infinite.<p>Your Religion Studies sucks.
As pointed out &quot;God&quot; sent an emissary and didn&#x27;t show up in both Christian and Muslim religions. Disproving the &quot;Proof&quot; that is the written history of God&#x27;s visits on Earth is as simple as pointing out contradictions.

This can, as you note, be done through CSS, but it can also be done through HTML (using the &quot;type&quot; attribute of the &quot;ol&quot; element.)<p>In the context of conversion of legal documents, where the marker type is intended for reference, it would be semantically correct to do this in HTML, so it would probably be desirable for markdown to support all the marker types supported by HTML for ordered list as markers for ordered lists, and set the type attribute correctly.<p>So, using a number should result in the current behavior, using a lowercase letter (other than one which might be a lowercase roman numeral, like &quot;i&quot;!) should result in lowercase-alpha markers, etc.",1381248247

Recommendations are that you test smoke detectors <i>each week</i>.  9v batteries are, for this purpose, dirt cheap.  Change all of them at the same time.  Or buy a more expensive detector with a 10 year battery.  (Or buy the Nest device.)<p><a href=""http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/smoke-alarms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/smoke-alarms</a><p>* Once a week test each alarm by pressing the test button till the alarm sounds.<p>* Once a year change the battery (unless its a ten-year alarm).<p>* Twice a year open the case and gently vacuum the inside using the soft-brush attachment to remove dust from the sensors. If it doesnt open, vacuum through the holes.<p>* After 10 years its best to get a whole new alarm.<p>If you&#x27;re living in an apartment building you can get fire alarms which tell you the zone an alarm is triggering in, which tells you what detector is having a problem with its battery.<p>Some people are comparing the Nest device with regular smoke detectors.  That&#x27;s gently misleading because the Nest alarms can link.   That&#x27;s nothing new, plenty of alarms link, but they are all more expensive than just a regular alarm.",1381248037

And for not having better procedures in place, I think that an apology wouldn&#x27;t be unreasonable.<p>In general, it seems to me that demonstrating empathy for your customers is a pretty reasonable strategy.  Even if they didn&#x27;t do anything wrong, and before they have finished this investigation, they can show that they care about the people using their system.<p>I don&#x27;t think that Twitter could go wrong by saying, &quot;We now see that we need to make it harder for scammers to switch the ownership of a Twitter account, and are looking into how to do so without hurting our legitimate users.&quot;",1390996797

7143311,comment,7094556,7139013,1,0,blobfish,,,"I was thinking somewhere on the similar lines when deciding how to approach this. I split the process into 3 initial steps as well.<p>1. Learn the C language. Read K&R book, then get my hands dirty with some relatively simple problems. Here I&#x27;m actually deciding between practicing with algorithmic problems and doing a simple project or I can probably do both. Anyway I&#x27;m leaning towards algorithms because they normally are short enough to be possible to work on with the minimal amount of knowledge on the standard library and are complicated enough to be a good practice, particularly when it comes to performance and memory usage. This approach would also make me learn how different data structures are handled in C and how to deal with memory management.<p>2. Learn systems programming. At this step after some initial reading I would like to join a relatively small open source project and try to fix some bugs or contribute some small changes to it. I didn&#x27;t decide yet what particular project it could be so any suggestions are welcome :) At this step I should become comfortable with writing C and gain some basic knowledge on systems programming.<p>3. Get deeper into systems programming. This is were I&#x27;m deciding between taking on Linux/BSD or MINIX. I suppose MINIX should work very well as a learning tool for OS design and implementation. So it could make transition to Linux/BSD easier. At this stage I could probably join some open source OS project.<p>What comes after that I&#x27;m not quite sure. There may be more steps involved or I may be ready to look for a job at this point.<p>I may also need to decide what exactly I want to work on which leads me to the difficult question I raised to myself when thinking about this. Should I specialize from the very beginning or can I be a generalist with a strong general systems programming knowledge and then get to the details when the need arises based on particular job?",1390996718

It was (IIRC) a Dylan interpreter (the acronym was &#x27;MINDY Is Not Dylan Yet&#x27;) and was very interesting both to experiment with Dylan and also to see how MINDY itself was implemented. \nAs I remember, a cool thing about the Dylan concept was that it had a sliding scale of dynamic-ness - in other words you could start off being quite relaxed about types but, where needed, you could narrow down the types, seal generic methods etc. and the compiler would then be able to optimise better, for example by avoiding dynamic dispatch if it could prove it knew the specific method at compile time.",1390996665

Unless the software implementation is terrible, the memory hierarchy does not pose a significant bottleneck for these tasks, and even older ARM designs like Cortex-A9 can achieve > 75% FPU utilization, comparable to x86 cores.<p>There are more specialized HPC workloads (sparse matrix computation, for example) where gather and scatter operations are critical, and the efficiency of the memory hierarchy comes much more into play (but in these cases even current x86 designs are stalled waiting for data).  There are also streaming workloads (which you seem to reference) where you have O(1) FPU op data element, which stress raw memory throughput and prefetch.

Since then they did everything in their power to restrict the use of internet. First they passed regulations that forced private ISPs to buy their bandwidth through a government organization and deployed a censorship software (rumored to be Chinese) on all of it, so blocking is national not per ISP. The they passed a law restricting home users to 128 kbps (yes, kilobits per second not even kilobytes). Then they criminalized providing anti-censorship solutions (but not using them, although it is debated).

7143218,comment,7141152,7142491,4,0,nmjenkins,,,"(Author of the spec here)<p>A fixed-size Merkle tree is a great idea if we wanted to sync the entire set of messages between distributed MX destinations. In fact, we should probably consider that approach for our server <-> server replication. However, JMAP is aimed at client <-> server sync. There are a number of different issues to consider here. The client may have limited or no cache (a webmail app for instance must normally start anew each time, and needs to efficiently fetch just what it needs; if we had to wait for a 60GB mailbox to sync every time we loaded our webmail, well, obviously that&#x27;s not going to work. A mobile mail client often only wants to download the first few items in the mailbox given the current sort order so it can display them to the client. The JMAP spec allows a client to download, say, just the list of the first 50 messages, newest first, in the Inbox (single round trip). Then, at a later point, it can ask for and receive a space-efficient delta update of what has changed within those first 50 messages in the Inbox, regardless of how big the Inbox really is, or what other messages may have been delivered elsewhere (including lower down the Inbox, but outside the top 50). Again in a single round trip. This is really powerful: you can see that by comparing the refresh time of a folder in the FastMail mobile web app with the iOS or Android native mail app (over IMAP); the mobile web app is much quicker.<p>The other thing to remember is that the metadata about the message is mutable, and needs to be kept in sync as well. Again, the modseq system described in JMAP allows this to happen efficiently. If you have a distributed server system with multiple masters, you will again use a different system to keep those in sync (as they each assign new modseqs, whereas the client does not). However, this too can be dealt with relatively easily: if the modseq for a message differs between two masters, it must be set on both to max(the higher of the two modseqs, the next highest global modseq on the server with the currently lower modseq). This will ensure that both will end up in the same state, and that the client will get refresh its state for that message if it has to, no matter which master it last synced with.<p>So essentially, there&#x27;s a difference in what you want in a protocol for server <-> server synchronisation for distributed mail backends compared to client <-> server sync for mail apps. JMAP is focussed on the latter, but tries to make sure it doesn&#x27;t include assumptions that severely limit the former. The spec does not require a particular format of message ids: they do not have to be based around IMAP&#x27;s ascending UIDs (although the sync algorithm for partial mailbox listings may be slightly less efficient if not).",1390994761

And the second 25%ish is just scrolling to the right location and printing out the letters, hence lots of <>s and .s. During the fill up stage each ASCII value is made using two of it&#x27;s factors, in an attempt to reduce the number of characters. So each ASCII letter looks like this N+[-<M+>] where N and M are the two factors chosen. For example 32, an ASCII space, is ++++++++[-<++++>], N=8, M=4.<p>I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t the most character efficient for short sentences, but it might not be too bad for paragraphs.<p>PS, in analysing that I have noticed there is a pointless extra > at the start.",1390993866

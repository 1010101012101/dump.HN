Chicago is very much a place where you take your chances.<p>You can live in Streeterville for example, as rayiner alluded to in another post... but what happens when you go out with friends??? What if they want to go someplace in say... Wrigleyville... some night??? You&#x27;re walking back to your car, or trying to get a taxi back to the loop, and you cross too close in front of a police officer, or his vehicle. (Basically, the same thing that bbarn was talking about in his post.) Even though it&#x27;s completely inadvertent, and done with no ill intent, I&#x27;ve seen this very thing go decidedly bad for people in the past. It seems that it didn&#x27;t go too well for bbarn either.<p>So if you&#x27;re asking for guarantees... I think that reasonable people will concede that there are none.<p>The best advice is to be aware of your surroundings, and be aware that police are extremely dangerous and best avoided. Just do the common sense kind of things... allow police the path if you see them walking on the sidewalk. Don&#x27;t look directly at an officer. When approached by a police officer, be extremely deferential. And for goodness sake, if you see police abusing power don&#x27;t try to intercede. Don&#x27;t let them see you recording or videoing the incident. When you have an opportunity later... just write an anonymous letter to a newspaper with the video or something. Etc etc etc.<p>Also... not trying to be even more of a dark cloud here, but I think a word of warning is appropriate on this particular point... if you are black and male, and assuming you are professional as you are a hacker news reader...

The trolls don&#x27;t want to go to trial blow a million dollars on legal fees then win 500k in damages.<p>But trolls are willing to trial for a 20% shot at a 200 million dollar verdict against Apple or intel. And Apple and Intel aren&#x27;t willing to risk a trial with a 20% chance of 200 million loses if they get a settlement offer for 10 mil.<p>But companies like Apple and Intel do fight a huge number of troll cases. So little trolls with shit patents don&#x27;t go after the big dogs. They know they&#x27;ll lose. Newegg just adopts a Stalingrad approach to appear like a big dog.",1453996235

I called and they were there in 15 minutes and said they could do what they can to help this guy. The cops seemed geniunly concerned about his and my safety. I was floored by how well this call went.<p>I live in one of the decent, but not wealthy neighborhoods. Chicago is about 1/3rd horrible ghetto and 1/3rd marginal and 1/3rd decent. Life in those other 2/3rd&#x27;s is very, very different.  If you&#x27;re outside of the typical &quot;northside&quot; neighborhoods the cops are much tougher and much more paranoid about being hurt or killed. I lived in one of those neighborhoods and there&#x27;s a completely different vibe there.  Cops pull up with 3+ squads at every call, take up defensive positions, hands close to weapons, etc.  A dog attacked mine when I lived in Humboldt Park and the cops came out and were cool about it, but clearly on edge as I lived in gang territory. In other neighborhoods, I don&#x27;t see this edge, or the defensive tactices. So yeah, there&#x27;s something here about cop safety in marginal neighborhoods. I imagine provoking these guys in these neighborhoods leads to bad outcomes.<p>Also, not to attack the GP, but there is a Chicago cyclist personality I see frequently. They do dick moves with their bikes, cause accidents, never obey any traffic law, scream at pedestrians, have unbelievable senses of entitlements, kick/punch cars, and constantly pretend to be innocent and are often incredibly confrontational when criticized.  I can&#x27;t imagine cops being nice to these people and the GP sounds like one of these people, which may explain many of his experiences. Chicago cyclists have a bad rep for a reason.<p>That said, I have next to zero fear of the police and lots of fear in regards to the high criminality and massive gang population here. I&#x27;ve been intimidated and threatened on the train multiple times, car/house robbed, had to walk lady friends to their homes/cars many times not out of courtesy but because there was a known rapist loose or the gang kids were clearly looking to start trouble that night, have been uncomfortably close to a gang shooting at least once, hit 3x by DUI drivers, etc. I suspect Chicago cops are tough because Chicago has so much serious crime. This isn&#x27;t the suburbs.<p>Wikipedia: Chicago has more gang members than any other city in the United States: 150,000. The city had 532 murders in 2012.<p>Chicago tribune: Chicago police officers shot 22 people in 2015, eight of them fatally.<p>532 vs 8, guys. Oh, 150,000 gang members is 5% of the population. That&#x27;s right, this is a major city where 1 in 20 are gang members.<p>That said, the powerful Chicago police union is pretty horrible. It exists to protect the worst of the worst, out of some misplaced sense of pride. I would love to see public sector unions eliminated in the city, if not nationwide. They just make things worse for everyone. Society needs an alternative to the union system in the public sector. I find it bothersome that all the recent ant-police sentiment still has not percolated to the police unions. I suspect this is a political thing where liberals can&#x27;t attack their own institutions. So expect zero real reform.<p>FWIW, I am darker skinned and do not pass as &quot;white.&quot; I&#x27;m typically clocked as a Latino. I&#x27;ve always owned older cars , dress very casually outside of work, and live way below my means. I doubt I was treated in any special way because of status/race. I don&#x27;t fall into the preferred categories.",1453995545

10988717,comment,10986167,10988569,0,0,bane,,,"disclaimer: I&#x27;m not of the mind that patents are a raw evil that needs to be swept from the earth. I understand how they can be beneficial for society ideally.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of ideas out there that it&#x27;s just old fashioned corruption and lobbying preventing it, but I can see one semi-valid justification:<p>Imagine a non-practicing company who ends up with a collection of patents (not a non-practicing patent troll). Today, and what normally happens, they would just license those out to various entities who wished to use them, and those companies signal a fairly pure intent to actually build something and sell it. The license cost is simply passed on to the consumer, but if the product is unique enough it&#x27;s not like there&#x27;s a cheaper alternative for anybody to compare against anyway. In the end the economy is richer for having the widget because now people can buy a new capability.<p>Now imagine a case where companies <i>must</i> exercise their patents. They&#x27;ll<p>a) be less likely to work on R&D since they&#x27;ll no longer be able to exercise a guaranteed monopoly, first to invent (or first to file) no longer has a motivational push to generate new ideas. Even inventing for the <i>sole</i> purpose of licensing your idea is a legitimate one. R&D is very expensive.<p>b) Only organizations with the financial power to both invent <i>and</i> manufacture will now file for patents. This locks away many small-time inventors (garage R&D) who today make a reasonable living off of their work via licensing to large corporations and locks away the power of innovation only at large and powerful organizations. In a sense the current patent regime is intended to allow anybody, large or small, access to a level playing field. e.g. I have a small LLC, if tomorrow I come up with a cool idea through my LLC and get it patented, I&#x27;d <i>have</i> to go about building it and putting it on the market, all expenses that I know my LLC doesn&#x27;t have the funding to support.<p>c) As a result, lots of half-assed shit will end up on the market since inventors will be forced to pump <i>something</i> out. Except now it will be optimized to cost them the least amount possible to get to market with rather than be optimized to try to be successful (that takes loads more money to try).<p>d) And/Or a weird economy will show up of small &quot;pass through&quot; businesses that exist only to provide a store front for the crap that inventors now have to produce in order to lock down their patent (since the end-game in most patents is licensing). They don&#x27;t really have any intention of selling anything, but inventors maybe produce 10 of their widget, pay a small stocking fee and the store will put it up for display. These stores will likely be in small, off-main-street light industrial zones with no traffic. It&#x27;s easy money for the store owners since inventors will literally pay them to stock the minimally produced junk. Think of the &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; stores at some local malls, now imagine those multiplied by a million.<p>IMHO a better solution is to make patents non-sellable. They can only exist under ownership of the inventor and can&#x27;t be accumulated under non-inventing entities.",1453995116

To avoid adverse selection, companies could even do it on a per-stock basis (or the regulator could run per-stock experiments, and analyse the effects).<p>I don&#x27;t know the details of HFTs in general, but to my understanding, what they do is <i>arbitrage</i> (orthogonal to liquidity) - basically, making sure that any simple patterns in the price are exploited (and thus reduced). Note, however, that HFTs themselves don&#x27;t make money - the markets could be just as efficient if only HFTs would participate, and with any new piece of information (earnings release, news, movements of other prices) a new equilibrium would establish (best bid and best ask) without any trades happening. Trading either comes from (1) disagreement about the price - and the person who&#x27;s right earns money, rightfully IMO (and if you don&#x27;t want to lose money, just don&#x27;t play), or (2) external circumstances (e.g. you want to buy a house => you need money => you sell your stocks), in which case HFTs are actually helping you (reducing the spread, and still earning money - e.g. a &quot;stupid market maker&quot; offers you 100 and then sells it for 101, earning 1, whereas the &quot;smart HFT&quot; offers you 100.01, and then sells it for 101, earning 0.99 - and you&#x27;re better off as well).<p>This isn&#x27;t the whole story, of course - there&#x27;s probably a lot of illegal things going on (dark pools, front-running, order flow selling), and a lot of waste could be reduced (e.g. by regulators forcing HFTs to share/rent infrastructure and only compete on algorithms, or mandating everyone has the same delay to the exchange), but those are problems only if you let HFTs exist.",1453994710

This is what causes hyperactivity, but also causes things like angry outburts, and other improper social behaviour that follows into adulthood\n\n  - The concensus among the research community is that ADHD is all negative. Measurably negative among all axes, especially when comparing people when on treatment and when not on it (drugs).\n\n I know some people like to do the whole &quot;silver lining&quot; thing (like with autism), but ADHD is a disease, an impairment. You should think of it like you would think of having the flu your entire life. Sure, you get good at vomiting your guts out cleanly, but not much great about it.\n\n  - And a super important part is that this basically never goes away. There&#x27;s this great analogy with a paraplegic. If you had a prosthetic leg, no matter how long you walked with it, you could never &quot;train yourself&quot; out of needing a prosthetic leg. Same thing with ADHD. The impulsive feelings don&#x27;t leave, it&#x27;s just that adults tend to be better at dealing with it than kids. But treatment is still very useful even later.\n\n\n (That last part is important: emotional outbursts at work can be a bit hard to manage...)</code></pre>",1453994057

If you do not check you have the perfect tool for a MITM.<p>Then is https more expensive than http?<p>Of course you idiot. Have you never seen your CPU burn under https? With TLS the load is on the first connection. Meaning it is around x% (x said to be 1 by google) for long sessions IF and only IF you have a costly engineer optimizing your stack. And I know by experience that google cipher suite are sometimes close to be ridicusly weak in order to achieve this. (I saw an RC4 while playing with gmail). And that is servers side. Add the client side.<p>So what about no &quot;engineer&quot;. What about an SSL2.0 cipher suite having RC4 MD5 ... and all the default weak settings recommended you can see on the internet?<p>Well, the illusion of security is no security. the S of https is for security. Having a tag saying I am secure if any government or criminal organisation can break your ciphering in a matter of seconds is no actual security. And it defeats the purpose of TRUST granted by security.<p>Then way pay the extra x% of https in this case?<p>Oh! I just read your last paragraph.<p>Can someone explain to this person why HTTPS cannot be cached? \nOh! It can it : has been sold to Tunisia by MS in 2007, France to lybia circa 2005, China is doing it ... for intercepting and deciphering citizens conversation.<p>Caching HTTPS is basically doing a Man In The Middle attack. It requires a &quot;joker&quot; certificate nicely given by a root authority. Doing so (as microsoft did) normaly induce &quot;the death penalty&quot; of security firms. MS is alive, hence anyway we cannot trust https ... since snowden revelations.<p>The proxy would still have to do the handshake anyway to have the https => cpu load.<p>The premise of security are trust. https nowadays is a costly joke.<p>For the record operators especially when IP routing goes through shared tunnel of collects (3G) have been traditionnaly using a protocol called WCCP to cache transparently your http content.

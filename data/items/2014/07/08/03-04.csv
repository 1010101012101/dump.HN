It&#x27;s not worth debating you on this if you don&#x27;t work in Python for your day job. There&#x27;s just so many misconceptions in what you&#x27;ve said.<p>From the way it sounds, you don&#x27;t, and Python3 is hardly a dialect. The challenges of Python3 aren&#x27;t for me or you, it&#x27;s for library maintainers. And anyone with years of software built on 2.x (which is nearly all of us). I assure you moving from 2 to 3 as an end user is not a challenge. I have used Python3, since 3.0. It&#x27;s no different &#x27;dialect&#x27;- but when I last did (3.4), I found major performance regressions in basic functionality (JSON processing) and I think most of us have given up on Python3 (there are plenty of reasons). I&#x27;ll revisit the idea of moving to it in another 5 years.<p>These issues are going unchecked in Python3 because there are no users. This is a major problem and plowing forward with Py3&#x27;s development is a huge mistake. It remains to be seen what the consequences of this are.<p>It&#x27;s simply propaganda to insist everyone is taught on Python3 as if it&#x27;s the future of the language. You know it is a logical fallacy to appeal to authority. Python.org is taking a political stance, not one based on the real world. Python 2.x is the present. If you don&#x27;t think so and refer to Python.org you&#x27;re not programming in Python for a living. There&#x27;s a major disconnect between the majority of the users of Python, and the core dev team that run that website. No one knows what the future of Python is yet, TBH Python.org should not be presenting 3 that way. In reality it&#x27;s the experimental branch.<p>If you are using Python, then use 3 if you wish. Trust me, no one cares. You won&#x27;t have support from most major distros and no online hosts. Google App Engine, Azure, etc are all on 2.x. You can&#x27;t be doing too much though to not be running into missing libraries and roadblocks.<p>The silent majority will move to 3 if and when it ever makes sense. More likely we&#x27;ll either go with the a fork, or simply move onto another language for the type of work that we do. Porting/testing is very expensive, why bother with that for no gains? We&#x27;ll simply move to something else and the majority of the userbase will be gone.<p>There&#x27;s only gains by using 2 but think what you will. Everyone is free to use what you want, including schools. I&#x27;m just explaining why it&#x27;s not as simple and straight forward as you put it.<p>If it were that easy, there wouldn&#x27;t be any controversy.",1404789845

8002845,comment,8000650,8002701,2,0,peatmoss,,,"My pleasure. I think a lot of people end up doing transportation-related things as the result of this kind of curiosity. In my case, I got serious about bicycle and pedestrian advocacy as an undergrad after a beloved professor was killed crossing a street by hit-and-run driver. It took me nearly a decade after that to decide to do a masters in planning. Then the research bug bit!<p>Planning is belligerently multi-disciplinary. Provided you can spin a good yarn in your entrance statements, and your CS GPA wasn&#x27;t in the toilet, having a CS degree is a fine asset.<p>One thing to think about (beyond &quot;do I want to enter a field in which I will earn less than what I&#x27;d make with a CS degree alone?&quot;) is how you want to come at transportation. For example, sometimes people ask what the difference between a planner and a civil engineer is. I usually reply something along the lines of &quot;if you want you build a bridge, call a civil engineer; if you want to know where to build a bridge, call a planner.&quot;<p>Planning, civil engineering, and public affairs all have their fingers in the transportation pie. If you&#x27;re a planner, a masters program will try to prepare you for a pretty broad range of tasks that include knowing something about your problem domain, how to communicate with political types, and how to communicate to angry citizens with pitchforks.<p>Civil engineering tends to focus more on nuts and bolts kinds of problems in transportation. Oddly, I feel like civil engineering is more solidly represented in statistical modeling functions within planning agencies. I.e. civil engineers tend to be more quantitative. That said, I always had the option of taking courses cross-listed with statistics--the same coursework that is now making my brain bleed in the PhD program.<p>Planning tends to be more systems-oriented at the technical side, and more human-oriented at the drum circle side. The differences between public affairs and urban planning can get pretty minor at times--my masters program offered concurrent MUP with public affairs (and maybe civil?) options. I knew a number of students who did public affairs and planning.<p>My feeling (perhaps erroneous) is that planning masters students get a little more latitude to play than do civil engineering masters students. There are planners that do lots of different kinds of stuff--even just within transportation planning, never mind land use (more important than transportation), electric, sewer, water, etc. As a result of needing to do lots of stuff, you get more freedom to scratch your own itch. That said, getting a job with your masters in civil and PE is likely a bit easier than as a planner. But, you&#x27;ve already got a job-friendly degree ;-) For the record, I had an easy time getting work as a planner after my MUP, but I did have classmates who took a little longer to find relevant work.<p>My recommendation before going and upending your life for another degree would be to go read some good mass-market books that explore basic concepts and contemporary issues in transportation planning. In order, I&#x27;d suggest Traffic by Vanderbilt, The High Cost of Free Parking by Donald Shoup, and Human Transit by Jarrett Walker (disclaimer, I had a minor role in reviewing the latter). All three are written with a minimum of jargon, and all three will give you a flavor for the kinds of things planners think about. You might then find out if your city has some sort of group that meets to hack for civic purposes. These are cheap ways of scratching the itch...",1404789659

It&#x27;s my opinion that music should not be free, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album&#x27;s price point is. I hope they don&#x27;t underestimate themselves or undervalue their art.<p>Music in the form of a physical or digital copy of a recorded track is not rare. Album pricing is based on supply and demand. The latter has decreased significantly in the past decade. Short of pulling a Wu-Tang[1], it would be futile for artists to try to fight market forces.<p>If Swift really wants to discuss the value of music in the context of music as an important, rare art form, focusing on what consumers pay for physical and digital copies of recorded music makes about as much sense as valuing Monet&#x27;s Water Lilies series based on how much Water Lilies posters sell for.<p>There are several rights associated with music and people have been buying and selling these rights for decades.

Our abuse team is constantly working to keep the No-IP system domains free of spam and malicious activity...We provide a valuable service for free, but because of this, it is common for users to abuse our service.  Our abuse team is amazing and they are usually pretty quick to shut them down, but sometimes a few can slip through the cracks&quot;.<p>No-ip was aware of the potential and had an abuse team to deal with such cases. They were also aware of other experts finding their abuse team wanting. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough evidence to suggest they were partly culpable in any particular case. Perhaps there were examples of particularly galling incompetence in their abuse team, or the abuse team tipping off fraudsters but otherwise informing them seems to be the most reasonable and responsible action.",1404789206

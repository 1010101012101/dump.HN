1122885,comment,1122651,1122865,0,0,lsc,,,"as an employer (sortof...  everyone is an 'independent contractor'  a mostly defensible position right now, as everyone works from home, and pretty much takes stuff off the list of things that needs to be done when they feel like doing them.)  I think that if you can talk employees into this arrangement, and retain them, having 2 20hr/week guys is better than having 1 40hr/week guy.<p>the first, most obvious benefit is redundancy.  If one employee gets sick or gets another job, I've still got the other guy, and can often talk him or her into working more temporarily to cover until I get someone else.<p>The other benefits are that I think nerds often under bill.  A person working for me 20 hours a week ideally (well, ideally for me, the employer)  gives me as much 'inspiration' as someone working 40 hours.<p>I also think employees are vastly more productive when they feel like working.  In my situation, if I pick the right people, I get to pay them when they feel like working, when they are most productive, and then not pay them when they are unmotivated, and thus less productive.<p>Now, if I hired everyone as employees, then we'd have interesting issues with health insurance;  each employee would have a per-month cost not dependent on hours I got out of them (I'm assuming that I'd have a better retention rate if I offered health insurance)  But it's possible that cost would be low enough to justify the scheme;  maybe I would just pay them a lower wage than I otherwise would?<p>(man, health insurance is fucked up... as far as I can tell, if I want to get people tax deductible insurance, I have to get everyone insurance;  If someone wants to opt-out, as far as I can tell, I can't give them the cash I'd otherwise be spending on them.)",1266057705

1122871,comment,1122718,1122860,0,0,tsally,,,"Even if you interpret it that way, she isn't qualified to reject the body of scientific biological research because she thinks the authors have ulterior motives.  Such a claim would require strong evidence.  Are there scientists with agendas?  Yes.  But on the whole, I think you can be pretty confident of objectivity.<p>Gould is a relevant example, but he didn't reject the influence of biology.  He simply rejected the idea of determinism based on our biology [1].  I don't think our biology determines us either, but we'd be fools not to take it into account.<p>EDIT: A choice quote from Gould's piece:<p><i>We are not denying that there are genetic components to human behavior. But we suspect that human biological universals are to be discovered more in the generalities of eating, excreting and sleeping than in such specific and highly variable habits as warfare, sexual exploitation of women and the use of money as a medium of exchange. What Wilson's book illustrates to us is the enormous difficulty in separating out not only the effects of environment (e.g., cultural transmission) but also the personal and social class prejudice of the researcher. Wilson joins the long parade of biological determinists whose work has served to buttress the institutions of their society by exonerating them from responsibility for social problems.</i><p>Similarly, I don't support using biology as an excuse for sexist behavior.  But denying that biology affects behavior is not scientifically accurate.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nybooks.com/articles/9017?sess=305fe41afae729849e1e7eb4b004bb81"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nybooks.com/articles/9017?sess=305fe41afae729849e...</a>",1266057229

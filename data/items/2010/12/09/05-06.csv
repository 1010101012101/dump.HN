Unsurprisingly, the results are different. In one of the four examples, I think the conclusion that there was an improper search is redacted.<p>The rules must by byzantine. I notice that the specific department of the government is redacted. That might be to protect the innocent. But other bits redacted are just bizarre. e.g. They redacted a version number in front of a policy name. They left the policy, but covered which version it was. ???<p>I have not met any, but I expect redactors are either grunts trained in global guidelines but without specific knowledge of what they are reading, or they are the people familiar with the material and are irritated to be taken away from their actual work. Either way there will be variable work. Secrets will be missed. Non-secrets will be redacted. I predict they err to the latter.<p>The FOIA requests are allowing out evidence that documents improper searches and information gathering. So, to that extent they are working.<p>Did the EFF make their entire corpus available so people can see how well? I didn't see a link in the article.<p>[1] Also note, the EFF isn't scouring documents to uncover unlawful information gathering, these are summaries of internal government self investigations.",1291874135

1986238,story,,,2,2,Skywing,"Ask HN: How do you stay focused?",,"Hi all,<p>I guess this is just a pretty open ended question: How do you stay focused on your project?<p>I feel like I always have problems staying focused. It's not that I get distracted and go play video games, or anything. The thing that usually ruins my focus is my project itself. This is something I find myself having to deal with on every project that I start. I think it may be because when I'm starting a fresh web project, there isn't much to it and it's very easy to get side tracked and work on other aspects of the site.<p>For example, the one thing that usually always steers me off track is Javascript. In my current project that I'm working on, I want to have a Google map and allow users to pinpoint their location on the map. Simply click the map, and update something else with the latitude and longitude of the click. I got this working, but just like every other project, instead of stopping with the rough, but working, code that I had, I continued messing with the Google map API and started to add markers and stuff to the map. Before I know it, I've got a big bad mess of Javascript that I just ended up scrapping in the end anyways.<p>That's just an example. I also get easily side tracked by CSS (I'm never satisfied with the way my pages look).<p>So, how do you all stay focused on implementing only your core features initially? Or even after the core is mostly done, how do you stay focused on whatever single thing you're attempting to implement at that time? Have you found that using things like Git help, for some reason? Do certain editors, or work flows help this?<p>I will admit, I don't usually map out my psuedo code or flow diagrams or anything before starting these. I will jot some things down in my composition book and organize my thoughts, but I don't ever do wire frames, or anything. Has anyone found that these help you stay on track?<p>Just curious!

So these won't help.<p>The key to what happened here is that the defendant was able to elicit the help of EFF and the Fenwick firm, undoubtedly pro bono, and this gave them first-class legal talent with which to pick apart the Righthaven claims. Unlike patent trolling suits, where the claimant is typically able to assert credible claims for millions of dollars, the Righthaven model relies primarily on bulk processing of settlements resulting from threats to file suit. Righthaven will scout out the web and find one-fer instances of ""copyright violation,"" as when a contributor to a site posts an excerpt from a news article in a comments section. The damages associated with this, even in a worst case, run no more than into the tens of thousands of dollars and likely would be far less. However, Righthaven takes an assignment from the newspaper that owns the copyrighted content and threatens to file its bullying suit, i.e., it threatens to subject the defendant to an expensive federal copyright suit that will cost far more to defend than is worth it for a typical defendant. In that context, Righthaven's business model depends on the vast majority of defendants caving and being willing to settle for a comparatively small dollar amount in order to avoid the suit. Righthaven does this in volume and that is how it makes its revenue - by coercing a lot of smallish settlements and relying on bulk processing to justify the economics of its efforts.<p>This model rapidly falls apart in any case where a serious defense is mounted and particularly where the defendant (a) is represented by first-class lawyers (as it was here) and (b) forces Righthaven to spend far more on processing the case than it can ever hope to recover. Here, Righthaven got hit with all this, plus aggressive counterclaims, leaving it unable even to dismiss the case without getting permission from the court. Seeing it had a major loser on its hands, Righthaven brought just such a motion to get permission to dismiss and met with a response from the defendant saying that the court must condition any such permission to dismiss on Righthaven's paying all of the defendant's attorneys' fees. All in all, a pretty disastrous result for Righthaven.<p>I am not sure how much this may be replicable in other cases but it certainly underscores that the Righthaven model is vulnerable to attack and may spur others to mount similar efforts. It is in any case a good first step.",1291872338

Because the lengths contract when we switch to a reference frame where things are in motion, we see higher charge densities (same charge per less length).<p>A simple demonstration: Say we have a charge neutral, current carrying wire. We model it as a bunch of positive charges staying still, and some negative ones moving. The positive and neutral balance, but there is still a current because only the negatives are moving. Now imagine we switch to a different reference frame, one where the negative charges aren't moving, but the positive one's are, we are flying along parallel to the current.

You could reply to my previous message now, as you can probably see.<p>Of course I was replying to tlrobinson, who said :<i>I'd rather do something I enjoy for slightly less money than get an office job or flip burgers.</i> That was in reply to swombat's question about whether the design thing is sustainable economically.<p>In Brazil it may be, in the US it probably would not. I have no opinion about Aurelio or his $15 site (although I am pretty sure someone else will do the same thing for $12 soon). I am well aware that Brazil has a different kind of economy from the US; what he is doing may well be sustainable in Brazil - although the cost of having a western-style standard of living with a computer, reliable electricity, and internet access is much closer to the cost of living in the US than it is to people earning $54/month in a favela or rural area.<p>I also completely understand the idea of doing something you enjoy, even though it might pay less than a conventional job. That is why I was working for an email/groupware startup before NCSA released Mosaic, to give you one example. There are certainly times that you should be willing to take a big economic risk, and refine your skills even if it is hard to sell your product/service in the market right now. I am just pointing out that doing this can also become a limiting factor, because you are associating your service with very low cost. You would not go into a Burger King restaurant and pay $100 for your dinner. Even if they hired a great chef and actually made a gourmet meal, almost nobody would risk paying $100 to try it. Similarly, if you try to get a job in a top restaurant you will need something more persuasive than previous experience cooking at Burger King. You could be an excellent self-trained chef, but they will judge you by the price and quality of food at Burger King. You could say 'I made a lot of delicious meals for my friends and family, they said my food was great.' The restaurant owner will probably suggest you get your friends and family to help you open your own restaurant.<p>why? Because life is short and people are busy. They don't have time to judge every job applicant or supplier individually. Instead they will look at price information as a proxy for quality. This is why companies sometimes ask job applicants for a salary history, they want a simple filter. If you get a bank loan to expand your business, the bank will want to see the last few years' accounts for the same reason. They don't understand your business, but they do understand cash flow.",1291871879

Using a Swayable doesn't make the decision making process so unbelievably simpler to make a user take the effort to change the way in which they make decisions.

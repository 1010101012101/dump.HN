6381297,comment,6380280,6380280,2,0,redtexture,,,"No.<p>Assuming you&#x27;re in the U.S., incorporation is neither here nor there in terms of transactions and taking in income.<p>Company payments to sole proprietorships and to partnerships need to be tracked by companies, and they are required to issue IRS form 1099 payment statements to non-corporate payees annually, when payments are above $600, and some companies elect to issue them to all non-corporate entities even if less than $600.<p>Another commenter mentions form W-9. This is merely a request to the IRS for a Tax ID number for some business. You can see that on the form, all of the types of entity you could be are mere check-off boxes. You can have several Tax ID numbers, as an individual running several  separate non-corporation (that is sole-proprietorship) businesses. There is nothing special about a corporate form for obtaining one or more Tax ID Numbers, also called EIN, Employer Identification Number. The businesses that pay you  want your EIN in order to issue a year-end 1099.<p>Corporate-ness typically involves several values (and administrative costs) to a business. The leading one, is a limitation of liability, when things go wrong, rather than your own assets (however small or large your own personal assets may be): it is the corporation that is acting, not you, and the corporations&#x27;s assets are looked to remedy errors and injuries. Similarly, for partnerships, all partners are liable for actions of their partner: this is what makes a corporate form useful for a multi-investor, multi-partner business. Sometimes insurance is available, and not so expensive that it can be an adequate means to meet the some potential liabilities, sometimes not.<p>Then there are tax and income issues that are different than the sole-proprietorship.<p>The questions you should ask your own accountant, and lawyer, and business advisor, which you now are on notice that you should have:<p>1. What particular advantages and costs come with the several typical operating entities you could use: Corporation, Limited Liability Company (LLC), and sole proprietorship (and partnership if you have a partner).<p>2. Separate from that, what are the tax consequences of each entity, and several Federal tax-filing-statuses: sole proprietorship, partnershp, LLC elections, Subchapter-S, Subchapter-C taxation (LLC and corporations)?<p>3. Is there any investor and partner involved, and can a non-partnership entity aid in structuring operations, and limiting your liability from your partner&#x27;s incorrect actions?",1379087941

I&#x27;d argue that it&#x27;s because the whole system wanted that to be true:  politicians wanted people to be buying bigger and nicer houses.  People wanted access to a nicer house than they can technically afford.  Companies wanted to push mortgages out, then slice them up to try to minimize risk.  The entire system from top to bottom wanted this.<p>> Everybody who saw that the housing bubble was stupid, and made money from it anyway by selling it as sustainable.

The Wikipedia article on insider trading is surprisingly informative on the counterarguments:<p>&quot;Milton Friedman, laureate of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics, said: &quot;You want more insider trading, not less. You want to give the people most likely to have knowledge about deficiencies of the company an incentive to make the public aware of that.&quot; Friedman did not believe that the trader should be required to make his trade known to the public, because the buying or selling pressure itself is information for the market&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;Legalization advocates also question why &quot;trading&quot; where one party has more information than the other is legal in other markets, such as real estate, but not in the stock market. For example, if a geologist knows there is a high likelihood of the discovery of petroleum under Farmer Smith&#x27;s land, he may be entitled to make Smith an offer for the land, and buy it, without first telling Farmer Smith of the geological data.[2] Nevertheless, circumstances can occur when the geologist would be committing fraud if, because he owes a duty to the farmer, he did not disclose the information; for example, if he had been hired by Farmer Smith to assess the geology of the farm.&quot;<p>...<p>&quot;There are very limited laws against &quot;insider trading&quot; in the commodities markets if, for no other reason than that the concept of an &quot;insider&quot; is not immediately analogous to commodities themselves (corn, wheat, steel, etc.). However, analogous activities such as front running are illegal under US commodity and futures trading laws. For example, a commodity broker can be charged with fraud by receiving a large purchase order from a client (one likely to affect the price of that commodity) and then purchasing that commodity before executing the client&#x27;s order to benefit from the anticipated price increase.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t feel that contradictory for me to believe insider trading should be a illegal in equities but legal in commodities, if only because of the externalities involving trust in corporate governance, the conflicting incentives (if the CEO can short his own stock, that creates some perverse incentives).  But there definitely a pro-market-signalling argument to be made WRT to the OP&#x27;s article.",1379087324

Nothing wrong with this but it&#x27;s a lot different than using its legal team to fight government abuses.

I have an issue that&#x27;s bothering me and I&#x27;d like some advice. (Do note: I want advice from <i>experienced freelance developers</i>, or people who have been in these situations before and can speak from experience, <i>not</i> people who are just guessing...)<p>I&#x27;ve worked for a few years for Client A, and developed web app for them. Now I have a new client, Client B, and I&#x27;m developing a web app for them.<p>Over the years, I&#x27;ve developed many general-purpose tools that I&#x27;ve used for Client A. Thankfully, most of them are in a separate open-source repo, and I&#x27;ve developed them on my own time. But, some tools are on Client A&#x27;s repo and legally are the IP of Client A. They&#x27;re not specific to that client&#x27;s app, but are generic (like tools for handling times and date, url manipulating tools, etc.)<p>Now, as I&#x27;ve started work on Client B&#x27;s code, I copied all the tools and I&#x27;ve been using them for Client B&#x27;s project. I know it&#x27;s illegal since they belong to Client A, but I&#x27;m wondering whether it&#x27;s a big deal. I&#x27;m asking not for the sake of these 2 clients, who are small non-technology companies who are unlikely to care or even know, but for similar situation in the future of my consulting career.<p>I considered asking Client A to open-source the tools, but I rather not. I&#x27;m the company&#x27;s only developer, and a request like that might seem suspicious to the CEO. From the CEO&#x27;s point-of-view, he has (1) little understanding of the situation and (2) something to lose and (3) nothing to gain and (4) a lot of important things to work on that are critical to the company.<p>I&#x27;d like your advice, especially hearing what you did in such situations and whether it turned into a problem in practice.",1379086258

Small business fads exist -- everybody seems to try to run the same business at the same time. Somebody gets the idea of importing cars -- and suddenly you have hundreds of copycat businesses -- all importing the exact same make and model of car. A relatively small steer towards e-commerce (If the pioneers are seen to be making money) could trigger a large avalanche of interest. The problem then will be persuading enough people to find distinct and profitable niches so that a sufficient number &quot;stick&quot; and are successful.<p>2. Technology start-ups require quite a lot more time and energy to be invested before you see returns. Certainly more so than a typical import/export business. Many will be discouraged by this, so the gentle encouragement may be required to help people stick the course. There are a lot of social groups and cooperative savings societies that already exist -- these could probably be used to help reach potential entrepreneurs.<p>3. A surprising amount of entrepreneurship is driven by middle aged women. These individuals are tremendously busy, and may already be running up to 2 or 3 small businesses (in addition to day jobs) so they may not be able to take on anything as time-intensive as a technology start-up ... but they are definitely movers and shakers in the Kenyan small business sector.<p>Finally, a caveat: I am also an outsider; my view of the Kenyan economy is filtered through a fairly narrow lens -- (My wife and her family).",1379085877

As a new student, you are given a list of all possible things you could learn. With a teacher, you map out everything you will need to learn, to become a well-rounded person and to prepare you for what you want to do after high school. When you complete this map of learning targets, you are finished with high school. Finish in two years, fine. Finish in six years, fine.<p>There are many practical issues to sort out in this model, but it is being done.

If you control what code is run in them and who has access to the containers and their hosts, then production use should be fine as far as security goes.<p>However, if you&#x27;re trying to run something which lets untrusted people login to the containers or run arbitrary untrusted code in the containers, then I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that with containers in a production environment.<p>One project you might like to keep an eye on is CoreOS [1].  As I understand it, their goal is to create an OS which will come configured to safely run containers.

I&#x27;ll just observe that there are different kinds of &quot;freedom&quot;.  In that earlier thread, I made the point that, as a founder, I have FAR more to do now, which seemingly means I have more responsibilities and less freedom. Well, yeah, no.  I mean, I have less <i>free time</i> now, in a sense.  But I have more <i>freedom</i> in that <i>I</i> am the one making decisions about marketing, sales, product roadmap, strategy, etc.  In other words, by founding a company, I&#x27;m at least a little more free to call my own shots.  I decide (well, along with my co-founder, so it&#x27;s not <i>only</i> me) what markets to pursue, what customers to chase after, what parnterships to engage in, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll argue that being a founder means both more responsibility and more freedom, even though that may sound paradoxical, given an intuitive notion of what &quot;freedom&quot; entails.<p>Also, for what it&#x27;s worth, in my comment on the other thread, I took the parent comment I replied to as using &quot;freedom&quot; more in the &quot;free time&quot; sense, which is why I agreed and made the comment I made.",1379084467

It provided a good additional buzz and it was somewhat social.  I&#x27;d even buy my own pack so I could have one if my other smoking buddies weren&#x27;t around (also when I was out drinking).  I averaged 2-4 cigarettes per week and I&#x27;d even go weeks without smoking as well.  It was sporadic and I didn&#x27;t enjoy cigarettes any other time.  When I saw people smoking during the daytime I would actually be kind of disgusted at the thought of smoking.  So I guess my point is... was I addicted?  I don&#x27;t think I was.  Was there ever a line that I would say that I &quot;quit smoking&quot;?  Eventually I did stop my &quot;casual&quot; routine.  Even now, I think I would still smoke a cigarette if I was put back into similar situations.<p>I think it&#x27;s completely reasonable to have tried a drug many times and not be considered addicted.  On the contrary, many of those same college friends I smoked with I would consider to be addicted.  It wasn&#x27;t a limited activity.  It was an anytime and anywhere activity.",1379084461

Life is a brutal war for survival you are going to get severely beaten down a few dozen times before you ever make it to the top.  1% of 1% have an easy route to the top.  The rest take it on the chin a few times, spit out their teeth, and keep throwing punches.<p>You seriously can't let that much negativity into your own life.  Your business failed?  Cool.

One of the folks I know who got into trouble post 2009 was selling ""PC tuneups and consulting"" for $50 initially, and $75 later, he would spend an hour with someone and help 'tune up' their PC (get rid of old software, update to a current AV, etc) and if they were interested he would consult with the client on what they needed/wanted in a PC and would give them some places where they could acquire it. After a couple of weeks, and even after raising his price by 50% he had more business than he could handle. I believe he also got an affiliated marketing deal with one of the AV companies and they would spiff him something like $10 if the customer bought their AV product.<p>Basically technology is really confusing to a lot of people, many of whom will gladly pay for someone to explain to them in small words what they need to do.",1353473802

Some people portray him as a Machiavellian psychopath (Jeff Wise), others think he just went paranoid nuts from drug use, yet if I were only to hear John McAfee tell his own story I'm fairly certain I would absolutely believe him.<p>He's clearly still in full command of his capacities at least as it comes to elucidating his thoughts in words, and everything he says is reasonable enough that I would believe it quite straightforwardly (as I did back when the raid news first came out) if it weren't for the notion planted in my head now from Wise's article that he's a scheming psychopath that's very charming and knows just what to say to make people believe him.<p>Either way, this guy has a <i>crazy shit life</i>. If everything is true in Jeff's article about his past and current life, I'd have to believe that he probably is just a scheming possibly paranoid psychopath, though still a little skeptical that he shot his neighbor to death. Fully plausible either way as I see it however, wouldn't be surprised at either outcome.<p>Also, I definitely hear the words ""kill him"" and ""that's what he fucking needs"" in that recording with all the background noise he sent out.

If the guy has been groomed from the earliest school days based on his/her performance that he/she can easily go into Harvard by the community, teachers, parents, friends etc and because of some ill health, he flunks a exam which makes him not achieve it, it may even destroy his whole life, because he may feel he has disappointed his teachers, parents etc.<p>The startup world creates enormous expectations using desire as the fuel. Imagine the number of people thinking just getting selected by YC leads to success of their idea or the number of people who get funding assume they have already succeeded. These are starting points and mid points in their pursuit to success. These creates unreasonable expectations which increases the pain. Where as if you pursued these are part of your desire the pain will be less.<p>Expectation is assuming you have got it and latter found you have not really not got it, where as desire is aspiring for higher things perfectly knowing you may not get it.<p>Creating Unreasonable Expectations causes more pain than creating Unreasonable desires.

4812851,comment,4809986,4810911,1,0,cloverich,,,"> Why does everyone really want to reform/abolish our patent system? I mean, really.<p>The current state of software patents is such that a company can stock up, lawyer up, then sue out of existence any attempt at competition. They were invented to promote innovation, not stifle it.  I honestly have a hard-time imagining any competent programmer standing behind half the garbage that passes for 'innovative' patents. It would be one thing if it were just patents that were not being used, but its taken to court, succesful cases that prove the point. One-click purchasing? One-box multiple search? Companies are patenting anything they can think of - the most obvious and minor of innovations - and succesfully pushing others out. That's anti-competitive in its aboslute purest.<p>> We can't just rewrite all patent law or get rid of patents. That's like saying the US needs a new constitution.<p>Most people aren't anti-patent et al - just anti <i>software</i> patents. A more apt analogy would be wanting to re-write a specific interpretation of a specific clause of the constitution.<p>>  it seems like there are a few trendy startups and companies out there who got burned by the patent system.<p>Read more. Companies large and small <i>regularly</i> get burned by ridiculous patents. Like Android removing unified search (<a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/samsung-galaxy-s3-loses-unified-search-after-apple-battle-7000000683/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/samsung-galaxy-s3-loses-unified-search-...</a>). That's absurd.<p>If companies were providing actual evidence of <i>specific</i>, <i>long-term</i>, <i>expensive</i> investments that resulted in software innovation, with a <i>compelling</i> case that it would not have been invented otherwise (aka a high school coder couldn't possibly mimic it), then yeah, <i>maybe</i> I coudl see a justification.

It is natural to share first with current collaborators, then with friendly recent collaborators, then with colleagues in related areas, then in informal seminar discussions, and so on.<p>One of the reasons for this is trustworthiness, as you say, but there is much more to it.  Trustworthiness isn't the main parameter at all.  A larger part of it is how much you trust the <i>results</i>.  At each level of disclosure, by social convention there is a rough level of implied confidence that can also be spelled out more carefully.  It is embarrassing to be wrong, and the higher your implied confidence was the more embarrassing it is!  The rationale behind this social convention might once have been trust, but it is now free-standing.<p>Some incentives for layered disclosure are obvious; for example, for PR it might be useful to build a buzz within your research community.  Other incentives are less obvious.  For example, you might disclose early results to a colleague to hopefully get them interested and involved in the research.  But if you disclose the results too broadly, too soon, then they will probably be less enthusiastic.  They want the inside track on a cool problem, so that there is some time and freedom to explore it, and it isn't a race.  (Races for results are stressful and also unfulfilling and wasteful; there's usually no point having multiple teams competing to do the same stuff, just trying to beat the others out for priority.)",1353471858

4812731,comment,4812724,4812724,1,0,jswanson,,,"Interesting answer by the Anonymous User:<p><i>I regularly worked with Elon while a part of his electric car company - Tesla.  At first, I hesitated to write a response, but as I thought about what I'd say, it was overwhelmingly positive.  So here we go:<p>Amazing visionary:  During one of my first meetings with Elon, he made a request that I thought, frankly, was crazy.  I asked my coworkers after the meeting if we really were going to do that.  I was told ""if Elon says to do it, we do it.  Give it time, you'll understand.""  Sure enough, each seemingly crazy request was grounded in a logic only Elon understood at the time.  But we trusted him and I ultimately found myself in agreement - sometimes it took six months or longer to get there.<p>Crazy smart:  No matter how tired he was or how many times he'd travelled back and forth across the country in the last few days, or how many fire-drills were running simultaneously, he understood what you were saying.  He'd sit there with his famous ""uh huh"" and a head nod, acknowledging that he understood.  And his followup questions were target and relevant.<p>No tolerance for bullshit:  When we met with Elon, we were prepared.  Because if you weren't, he'd let you know it.  If he asked a reasonable follow up question and you weren't prepared with an answer, well, good luck...  Our discussions were efficient, to the point, and based in fact.  He expected to see progress.<p>Execution:  You always need to be making progress.  And if you weren't, you needed to escalate or find a solution to the deadlock.  It was unacceptable to keep problems to yourself.<p>Willingness to help us get ""unstuck"":  Sometimes we'd get stuck dealing with a vendor or making a decision across departments.  He often tell us ""Get me on the phone with the CEO of <insert company here>.  I don't care what the problem is.  We need it resolved now.""  Or if it was a company decision, he'd just assert the answer and we'd move on.<p>No fear of making the hard decisions:  When you're in the trenches working on a hard problem, it's natural to convince yourself it can't be done.  You start to compromise.  Elon had no tolerance for this and rightly so.  We'd exceed our goals, because we had to.  It was how the company would survive and he reminded us of this if we drifted too far.  If market conditions prompted us to change course, we would.  If we needed his sign off on a large project or spend, as long as we did our homework, it was logical, and we laid out a plan, he'd be ok discussing.  But he'd often send us back to rethink the proposal if it didn't jive.  He wasn't afraid to spend money when needed.<p>Drive to do the ""right thing"":  It doesn't matter what the status quo is.  Never tell Elon ""well, that's how we did it at Ford.""  He pushed us to always do the right thing for the customer.  Making money is important to keep the company running, but it's not the most important thing.  He pushed us to make a great product that is uncompromised in solving the needs of our customers, even if it goes against the automotive norm and the critics on Wall Street.<p>Hands on:  We'd frequently see him looking at a CAD drawing at an engineer's desk.  He has all vehicle engineering changes first installed on his Model S or Roadster so he could personally approve it before it goes to customers.  His expectations were high.  If we couldn't meet them, then he'd rather scrap the work than build a mediocre product.  He wasn't afraid to get down in the details.<p>Personality:  Sometimes he'd be in a really good mood.  Sometimes not.  But for the most part, I found him to be easy to get along with and supportive when progress was being made.  But if too many bad meetings took place in a row, then beware...  And be careful disagreeing with him.  He frequently knew more than we expected, so it was risky to tell him he was wrong because he might not be.<p>All in all, Elon has a dedicated and loyal following.  It's because we believe he knows what he's doing. He doesn't inspire us through big speeches and eloquently written emails.  He focuses on getting work done, executing to plan, and driving positive change.  And nobody at Tesla had more skin in the game than Elon.  I'd choose to follow him over any big talker with empty promises.  His push to improve the auto industry is refreshing.  His dedication to improving the quality of the world we live in is inspiring.  It's a rarity in the business world.  I hope we each do our part in making his vision a reality, as it's ultimately in our best interest.<p>Edit - Response to comments:<p>Negatives of working with Elon:  Very demanding, he's not afraid to fire poor performers, you do what he says (if you disagree, be thoughtful about whether it's worth the risk, most of the time it's not...), not everyone works well with such a strong authoritative figure, most people are scared of him, his ambition can be exhausting - there's always another huge problem we have to solve, long hours.<p>Why post anonymously:  So I could write the above paragraph.</i>",1353471311

It was almost like I was forging the path through the sea of unknown information around me. I don't have enough experience in the world to determine whether or not my thinking had influence on what happened, but it provides an interesting framework for some thought. What if you could control the world, and you were the center of the 'relative universe'? Quantum mechanics predicts that prior to the first consciousness observed a wave function collapse, the world could have not existed, it was merely a fuzzy combination of wave functions that never had definition. What if this was happening every time I did something, interacted with something, noticed something. What if, when I thought about something, it collapsed the wave functions necessary to bring me that information? What if I controlled the world, and whenever I reached in to grab information, the necessary wave functions collapsed (regardless of where they had to). What if we could have multiple layers of collapsing wave functions, so you can live your life, I can live my life, and until we communicate, we lose the necessity of having the same time or space clocks? What if the world reconciles the differences when necessary, rather than all the time?<p>It's easy to get sidetracked when I'm thinking.<p>At what point do I call a thought my own? I'm not sure, I'm not even sure if ideas are my own thoughts. My thoughts are the ones where I can follow the train of logic that got me to where I am now. An idea is a lightning bolt. To backtrack where an idea came from, generally all I get is a couple inputs, a big jump in logic, and a conclusion. you can say what inputs were necessary, but that doesn't always get you to the output. I call these 'prime ideas', these are the good ones that cannot be assembled from combining (in some way, shape, or form) previous ideas. Prime ideas are ones that don't feel like they come from me, I wasn't thinking about anything, I was cleaning the kitchen when a lightning bolt in idea space struck my brain.

With enough people doing it, some people get very good at it and are able to consolidate and raise barriers to entry.  So now that previously very attractive thing is slightly less attractive because there's more ramp up required.<p>Fortunately, you do have valuable skills.  Unfortunately, as you point out, even putting those to optimal use requires significant ramp up--you've got to build a name for yourself or you've got to start some kind of consulting company and build a client list.  Then suddenly you're in the consulting business.  If you just jump into it and take whatever you can get, you'll make significantly less.<p>It's not even a matter of doing something you'd rather not do--there are tons of people out there that will do things most people don't want to do for very little money--and they do it for a living.<p>So of those, you could try hitting odesk or elance or any number of freelancing websites to pick up a quick gig--but even that requires a sales pipeline that takes some time to get going.  Personally, I'd put it on a credit card if I were in a similar situation, and lacking that, would probably start selling stuff.",1353471030

Having access to the code is part of the reason people choose to build their sites on WordPress. More installs than not have some kind of customization done. Plus, you'll have less satisfied customers (inevitably a significant portion will have issues getting the loader/licensing setup to work on their shared host, or will have other issues you can't help them with because they can't debug the code) so less blog writeups / recommendations driving referral sales.<p>I was in the WP business for a while, with about a quarter million in sales before I sold it off, and did nothing to prevent piracy.

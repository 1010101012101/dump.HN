You seem to be misrepresenting what they intended to show with those numbers. The point of that number was not to show a decline, but rather to show stagnation.<p>""The study found that, for the first time in decades, the growth rate of immigrant-founded companies has stagnated, if not declined. In comparison with previous decades of increasing immigrant-led entrepreneurism, the last seven years has witnessed a flattening out
of this trend. The proportion of immigrant-founded companies nationwide has dropped from 25.3 percent to 24.3 percent since 2005. While the margins of error of these numbers overlap, they nonetheless indicate that immigrant-founded companies dynamic period of expansion has come to an end.<p>We also performed a special analysis of Silicon Valley, which is widely known as the international hub for technological development and innovation. The findings indicate that 43.9 percent of Silicon Valley startups founded in the last seven years had at least one key founder who was an immigrant. This represents a notable drop in immigrant-founded companies since 2005, when 52.4 percent of Silicon Valley startups were immigrant-founded.""<p>Also, some people are starting to notice that innovation is slowly stopping:

4652213,comment,4651694,4651694,2,0,mdasen,,,"This really came about because of monopoly power and it takes time for things to change.<p>Here's some pseudo-history to illustrate a point.  Imagine living in a city like New York a hundred years ago.  There are a limited number of theaters and you can't have infinite theaters and potentially can't even have enough theaters to keep up with demand for people wanting to see theater shows.  Why?  It's hard to get contiguous land, current theater owners oppose planning permission for new theaters, etc.  These theaters rake it in on high margins since the supply is restricted compared to the demand.  They also have power over the actors since there are more people who want to be actors than there are acting positions and so they exploit them for low wages and/or poor conditions.  Even if you're an electrician and you're getting paid market wage, you're annoyed because the theater owner is raking it in due to their monopolistic/oligopolistic power in the market place and you want in on some of that fat margin.  So, you form unions to get in on that fat margin.  The theater owner can afford it because you're now both exploiting the theater going public.  Under better economic conditions, theaters wouldn't be able to charge so much and there wouldn't be the margins to support above market wages.<p>The same is true in film and TV.  There are again limited theaters to show movies and the theater wants to make the most off a show so they want to run big ones.  This provides fat margins to movie makers.  Of course, your need for actors has been drastically reduced making your margins way better than stage theater owners could ever dream of.  Of course, seeing those fat margins, the actors want a piece of it.  Realistically, they aren't doing something more than stage actors were, but c'mon the money is there and a normal person would want a piece of it.  Same goes for television: there were/are a limited number of channels due to licensing.<p>Programming is different.  In many ways, we fight against that economically bad situation.  We disrupt markets.  Our culture is one where we think you should be rewarded for doing something good for people, not entrenching yourself and keeping others with good ideas and products out.  Our medium also tends to be infinite.  There aren't a limited number of channels (websites) or a limited number of games that could be created.  We can create as much as there is demand for.<p>In fact, as we look at the entertainment industry and its stance on copyright, we can see how we're slowly killing their old way of thinking.  We don't want to watch reruns - make more content for lower budgets rather than restricting the amount of content.  We don't want to pay the high margins - we see that the entertainment companies are exploiting us (along with the actors, techs, and others taking their cut of the exploitative margins).  We see how it's rotten.<p>And it's important to note, as others have, that the way entertainment is set up is somewhat like a lottery.  There's a lot of actors who spend a decade waiting tables only to give up.  That doesn't really happen in our profession.  Heck, having graduated from university half a decade ago, the only people I know who have been employed non-stop are CS people.  We create good value across a broad spectrum of skills and we get good compensation for it - however, we don't have a lottery.  Now, if we artificially restricted the number of websites allowed to exist (or games allowed to be made), those few websites would hire the best (aka, the star actors) for higher wages than they currently get, but many people might be waiting tables, trying to make connections, running white-board algorithms auditions all the time, etc.  I mean, I know some people that dream of getting that Google job, but the difference between the somewhat low-end in CS which offers a higher than median income salary with good benefits and Google isn't the difference between waiting tables and being Liam Neeson.<p>And, frankly, getting a union like SAG wouldn't help us in the way SAG helped actors.  It helped the actors because the movie companies were exploiting the public.  As such, a union would help the actors get in on the price gouging and if they asked for a lot, the movie companies could raise prices a bit.  The companies we're working for usually don't have margins like that because it's easy enough for another company to come in and offer the same service at a lower price.  Like, a search engine couldn't charge you $1 per search because Google, Yahoo, etc. are free.  If Google started charging, you'd just use Bing.<p>I know how nice it would be to live in a situation where you got higher margins for your work, but in the end someone has to pay that: the general public.  That only works if you restrict people from competing and make the supply scarse.  Culturally, that isn't us (we prefer disrupting these types of situations) and economically, we wouldn't be able to pull it off since we don't have the history of barriers.  I know, I sometimes pine for the lack of competition that lawyers, doctors, actors, etc. enjoy.  But ultimately, that even comes at a high cost to them: once you're in, it's great, but on the outside actors have a hard time breaking in, doctors have to go through a decade of schooling, and law school basically tortures its students.  Because we operate at the margins we operate at, people can't force us to bow down to them: we can wear what we want, often get flex time, and usually get and keep jobs on our ability to do the job (at least more than many professions).",1350240806

4652162,comment,4651445,4651671,4,0,klint,,,"I'm a tech journalist -- I write for both TechCrunch and Wired Enterprise. 
I didn't write either of those pieces mentioned, but like many other tech journalists you'll find plenty of re-writes in my portfolio.<p>I'm speaking for myself and not from either company. But I can tell you though everyone in the industry is aware of the problem and trying to get away from re-writing to produce more original content.<p>The problem, as I see it, is that volume drives most online publishing. Making money depends on having updates throughout the day. That means every writer needs to post something every day -- usually more than one thing a day.<p>Even though most of these quick hit stories don't get many pageviews individually, they add up, and occassionally even a quicky will become a ""blockbuster"" that gets a huge number of pageviews. Original stories get a more consistently high number of hits, but they take much longer to produce.<p>I'm not sure people appreciate how much time it actually takes to write this stuff. Even doing quick hit journalism takes time. For example, I spent a couple hours this week on a post about Solr 4.0. It's short, and it's based entirely on the announcement/feature list but it still took a couple hours to write.<p>I have a bunch of original stuff I'm working on, but quick hit posts cut into the time I spend on those stories. At least part of that is a time management issue on my part -- and I'm a slower writer than many of my colleagues -- but I expect that juggling the needs to publish daily with longer form work is an issue for many tech bloggers.<p>(You should also not underestimate the amount of time we spend filtering information and looking for new -- e-mail, briefings, competitors sites, Twitter, etc.)<p>Anyway, I think things are slowly changing for the better thanks to reader demand for better content. But there's also a need to balance completeness of coverage with original work.<p>It's funny that Wired was singled out because I think they/we actually have a really good original content to re-write ratio (though yeah, Wired's always been known for sensationalist headlines). TechCrunch and Business Insider both have lots of original content as well. Because BI does so much volume I think people overlook the original stuff.<p>Another note about rosy retrospection: I don't want to defend the rewrite churn, but I do want to point out that even most daily newspapers have a significant amount of non-original content. Instead of re-writes though they tend to rely on newswires and syndicated columns and comics.<p>Re-writes aren't just done to get a quick post, they're also done to point readers to stuff they might not otherwise read -- as jbrodkin points out, not all TC readers read TorrentFreak. There are otherwise of getting this sort of stuff out --  like maybe just doing a linkblog that points directly to a story run elsewhere. In some cases it's possible to just call the original source and get the story so you don't have to link to/re-write a competitor's work -- I do this when I can but it slows things down (example: my story on Elbrus Technologies for Wired ran two days later than all our competitors because I waited for people from the company to get back to me instead of just basing my story on the EETimes report).<p>So yeah, it's getting better, everyone's worried about it but it's not simple to fix.",1350240134

Not just tourist flights, but tons of science missions as well.  Taking a step towards someone being able bail from those kind of flights is definitely useful. Very unlikely that this would be used for orbital launch anytime soon, it's way safer to abort an orbital launch <i>in the capsule</i> than to try and eject.<p>The military has also looked at using suborbital rockets to transport special forces hundreds of miles in a few minutes, then deploy them high over a hotspot quickly. So it could conceivably be useful for those purposes as well. (To be clear, these are just forward-looking conceptual studies. I'm not saying the military has these vehicles ready to go or anything like that).<p>Lastly, these guys are innovating on spacesuits design, which has been badly needed. Only a handful of spacesuit designs have ever been built and actually used in practice, and they were built by government entities. We're talking the slowest, most ponderous development cycles imaginable. NASA is still essentially using the same spacesuits on the space station that they first used with the shuttle in the early 1980's.  Think about how many gains we've made in materials since then.

In the porn case, you  have material produced with the consent of the participants (ideally). Those arguing against it are using a speculative argument that some viewers might be led to predatory behavior from it.<p>In the creepshots case, the material is produced without the consent of the subjects, and is arguably obtained by people who are engaging in predatory behavior and rewarding them for that behavior. The link between creepshots and predators is thus not speculative, and it is combined with a gross violation of the privacy of the subjects of the photos.<p>Furthermore, the acceptance of creepshots harms all of us in the United States. A key aspect of our Constitutional protections against unreasonable intrusion in our private affairs by the government is the notion of a reasonable expectation of privacy.<p>When we, as a society, decide that some particular loss of privacy is acceptable that moves the bar a little on what the government is allowed to do.<p>See this fantastic article by Alex Kozinski, Chief Judge of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on how we are giving up our privacy voluntarily and how that is giving more power to the government: <a href=""http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/dead-past"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/online/privacy-paradox/dead...</a>",1350240051

The cultures of the communities are largely technical, which is a culture that tends to care more about accuracy and truth, rather than just how closely a comment hews to personal opinions. It's okay to disagree if you present reasonably worthwhile support in the post.<p>2. The structure of the communities only allows highly valued members to down vote. On Slashdot all moderation (up or down) is controlled by the karma system, and metamoderation ""watches the watchers"". Here on HN, you must have quite a bit of karma (I think ~500 these days) before you can down vote.<p>Compare to Reddit, which in most subreddits probably the worst quality moderation I've ever seen in a community. Unpopular truths are downvoted to oblivion, and lies rise to the top if they validate popularly held beliefs.

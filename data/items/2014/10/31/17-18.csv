Most of the rocket fuel and oxidizer are used to increase velocity; comparatively little is used to gain (the first 30k&#x27;) altitude or lost to atmospheric drag.  The main benefit to air-launch is reduced range safety costs, and ease of scheduling, as the launch vehicle can be taken out over an unoccupied stretch of ocean, and range rental/lease costs are basically eliminated.",1414778363

I wonder if we had any space vehicles at all right now, in that case.<p>EDIT: Nevermind, FTA:<p>> <i>If the radius of our planet were larger, there could be a point at which an Earth escaping rocket could not be built. Let us assume that building a rocket at 96% propellant (4% rocket), currently the limit for just the Shuttle External Tank, is the practical limit for launch vehicle engineering. Let us also choose hydrogen-oxygen, the most energetic chemical propellant known and currently capable of use in a human rated rocket engine. By plugging these numbers into the rocket equation, we can transform the calculated escape velocity into its equivalent planetary radius. That radius would be about 9680 kilometers (Earth is 6670 km). If our planet was 50% larger in diameter, we would not be able to venture into space, at least using rockets for transport.</i><p>Anthropic principle my a$$.

I believe a model where candidates pay 3rd parties for precise jobhunting help is economically rational, and can work - it&#x27;s effectively what we&#x27;re doing at <a href=""http://offerletter.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://offerletter.io</a>.<p>Here&#x27;s where you and I diverge:<p>1) Yes, engineers and other in-demand workers have ready access to jobs. I remember when I was looking for a good engineering job out of Amazon, I was basically spammed nonstop by virtually every party on the planet.<p>2) But the <i>opportunity cost</i> for poor job selection is enormously high. The difference between choosing between a good startup on good terms, and a less-good startup on less-good terms, can literally mean the difference between retiring 20 years early having your work used by millions of people, and just puddling around for a few years with, say, the occasional PyCon lightning talk for visibility.<p>At <a href=""http://offerletter.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://offerletter.io</a> , we are doing precisely this - we are getting paid by engineers, designers and PMs for value added - in this case, during the negotiation process. Our team of Advisors guides candidates on the &quot;last-mile&quot; of offer selection and negotiation in exchange for a cut of the increase.<p>It makes too much sense - there&#x27;s massive information asymmetry during the process, companies are full of shit, and many people outside of &quot;the club&quot; - however you choose to define it - just don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re worth, or how to get it. While we can&#x27;t justify charging the $10k-$30k that recruiters make, the incentives are still incredibly strong for us to do what we do.<p>And of course there&#x27;s the ethical and human component, which is very strong - I tried more traditional recruiting for a while and just raw selling of companies is so tiring.

You wouldn&#x27;t want to live off celery and iceberg lettuce, even though they are low fat, low carb, and high in fiber. Likewise, things can be too interactive. No one seriously looks at a car and says &quot;if only I could turn my front wheels a complete 360 degrees.&quot; It&#x27;s only safe to turn them a few degrees in each direction most of them time. Sure that might mean you need to put the car in reverse and try again, but at least you don&#x27;t need to worry about getting yourself into unexpected situations like starting off with your wheels pointed straight (but straight behind you). However, I have seen some specialty vehicles (like some trucks, semi trucks, and forklifts) where these rules don&#x27;t apply or only weakly apply.<p>I&#x27;m happy you have the options you want. I also have the options I want. I don&#x27;t want a mouse to navigate my media player, and I can&#x27;t agree that the mouse is the best option for that use. A mouse is great for navigating a web page where the links are scattered everywhere or through a document where you might need to click at any point to begin editing, but for structured lists, even on a computer, I navigate with the arrow keys (and occasionally pgup/pgdn/home/endm giving me an 8-way d-pad).

The goal of Fuzix is to provide a reasonably complete Systen 5 Unix experience without all the bloat. At this point in time the kernel needs about 40K, plus memory for user space.<p>The Initially supported processor architecture is the Zilog Z80. The code uses no &quot;naughty&quot; instructions so should run correctly on clones and variants, as well as on things like the T80 FPGA core. The core code has been built for 6809 and 6502 as a sanity test but more work would be needed to bring up an actual platform. In theory if it&#x27;s got 8bits and banked RAM you can probably run Fuzix OS on it.<p>At this point there is no 8086 port. It&#x27;s certainly doable for a PC/XT or PC/AT style box but needs a usable open source ANSI C for 8086.. I&#x27;ve done some initial work on pcc (<a href=""http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/</a>) but could do with help on bringing that up further as I&#x27;ve not had time to make much progress on it.<p>So why Fuzix ?<p>- There are various other &quot;modern&quot; OS for Z80 systems but they are not CPU portable, and except for CP/M mostly non-free or depending upon non-free tools. In time they will become a liability not an aid to playing with old systems<p>- UZI is neat but constrained by limits in the tools and unbanked memory configuration<p>- UZI180 is neater but still lacks some basic features<p>- All the existing UZI variants are forks, and generally incompatible. That&#x27;s not a long term sustainable way to maintain retro systems.<p>But in truth the main reason is simpler<p>- Because it&#x27;s fun.... and it&#x27;s halloween which as an ex Red Hatter is kind of the right day for a release<p><a href=""https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX﻿"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/EtchedPixels/FUZIX﻿</a>   &quot;",1414775722

8539864,comment,8537756,8539581,0,0,Jweb_Guru,,,"When code aborts, you don&#x27;t <i>have</i> to reason about it in calling code.  When you decide to abort, you are not just suggesting that there might be a problem.  You are asserting &quot;nope, there is no reasonable way I can continue here.&quot;  Which is exactly what task failure is supposed to be used for, incidentally (which is why it was renamed to panic!)--normal, expected error conditions that you can actually do something useful about should be handled through the type system, not propagated through code that might not even be aware of its existence.<p>In the meantime, abort completely cleans up any in-process state--closing network pipes, deleting temporary files, deallocating mmaped memory, and so on.  And what it can&#x27;t clean up can&#x27;t be relied on anyway, because programs can <i>always</i> be aborted unexpectedly in other ways.  Whether it&#x27;s the OOM killer, various Rust behavior that triggers abort (panicking during unwinding, for example), stack overflow, power loss, or just SIGKILL, a robust program can never rely on its destructors running anyway (and destructors failing to run is explicitly not part of Rust&#x27;s definition of unsafe).<p>So ultimately, the reason abort is easier to reason about is that except in a few special cases (like embedded, where you may have complete control of the hardware--but you likely don&#x27;t want to be using task failure there), your program <i>already</i> has to be designed to expect an abort at literally any time.  Aborting may not always be <i>desired</i> behavior, but it never introduces additional cognitive load, or creates unsafety where it didn&#x27;t already exist, in the way that exceptions do.",1414775686

Apple builds its apps on private APIs, while third parties must build their apps on inferior public APIs. Apple gets to create and use new UX, while third parties must wait until Apple uses it first. On Android, Google&#x27;s apps use the same APIs my own apps use.<p>&quot;Android just went for the &quot;whatever&quot; option, and let users deal with that.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s funny.

None of the manual testing that Apple does before allowing an app on the App Store stops malware any better than the automated testing that gates publishing on the Play Store.<p>Looking at allowing installation of apps from unknown sources from the other side, this lets me develop apps <i>for my own phone</i> for free, without paying a $99 / year tax. Even more than the private APIs issue, this is what made me jump on the Android bandwagon early on and makes it hard for me to understand why a person who enjoys software development would choose the iOS ecosystem.",1414774966

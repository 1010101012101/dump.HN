2743210,comment,2742630,2742630,3,0,falcolas,,,"Anybody who thinks that mobiles will replace consoles for gaming doesn't actually seriously game (or perhaps it's more accurate to say that they aren't interested in games more complicated than farmville or Angry Birds).<p>Consoles (and PC's for that matter) offer up several things that phones can not offer.<p>1) Decent controls. Controls for phone based games are terribly imprecise; to the point where even games specifically designed for phone controls don't always do what you want them to do. Even phones with hardware controls are uncomfortable for someone like me to use for a long period of time (Such as the PSP Go and it's new mobile successor)<p>2) Gaming on large displays. I don't mind my mobile gaming - I've owned most handhelds since the gameboy - but I don't want to play Rage or Skyrym on a screen less than 11"" diagonal.<p>3) Stable hardware specs. I don't have to worry that my 3 year old 360 won't play Skyrym when it's released. I do have to wonder if my original droid will play the latest hotness in games.<p>4) Stable internet connections. I've tried an MMO on a phone; the lag was unacceptable.<p>5) I can play on a console all day long and not worry about battery life.<p>6) Textures. No handheld can match the texture resolution of the consoles, simply due to the storage requirements for the graphics & limitations on realistic bandwidth use to download a game on a phone.<p>Sure, the current consoles are starting to show their age. But their _launch_ titles still look better than any phone game I've ever seen, and we're nearing the point where new consoles will start making their appearance (see Nintendo's recent announcement about their new console).",1310144345

2743189,comment,2741425,2742743,2,0,scythe,,,">You're making this into a business decision.<p>Well... that's the point. I really don't want to talk about it as an ethical decision, and I guess I can avoid that by pointing out that it is more obviously a good business decision. I'm sure Google put a lot of thought into this, but I'm also sure they put a lot of thought into the launch of Google Buzz. Unfortunately, the sheer amount of thinking that goes on doesn't guarantee success.<p>Of course, now you've cornered me, so I <i>have</i> to talk about it as an ethical decision. So, some things which pop into my head:<p>1 - the ability to not show your gender does not change the relative status of the genders in public perception (hereafter ""gender inequality"")<p>2 - the ability to not show your gender does diminish the importance of gender inequality <i>w.r.t. setting up a Google+ account</i>, i.e., inequality affects you less if you don't have to show your gender<p>3 - gender inequality is generally considered a bad thing<p>Per point (1), the negative consequences of allowing people to not show their gender are probably small, and per points (2) and (3), the positive consequences are probably significant. This means that people are probably better off being allowed to not show their gender.<p>But b'gosh, I've let yet <i>another</i> cat out of the bag by introducing the concept of ""perceived risk"" and claiming its existence.<p><i>Why do I think there is perceived risk?</i><p>Personal experience. If you haven't run into a sexism debate yet, you haven't browsed any serious technology forum with any sort of regularity. If, in a sexism debate, you don't see comments about men doing untoward things to women, you probably haven't read the debate very thoroughly. If there is a gorilla in a room, and nobody sees it, nobody talks about it; if there is no gorilla in a room, but everyone thinks they see a gorilla, people talk about it: people talk about what they see. I hear enough talk either from women complaining about creepy guys or from people talking about such complaints that I figure it is commonplace. In lieu of evidence I go with intuition, because at some point I have to make a decision.<p>I call it perceived risk because, in short form, people think that things they don't want to happen (anything from creepy private messages to violence) will happen if they show their gender. I'm trying not to accuse anyone of malice, negligince, cowardice or irrationality. Perhaps in some ironic twist this itself is cowardly.<p>So, from an ethical standpoint, I hope this is enough to justify allowing people to hide their gender.<p>There are many more questions: what risks are perceived, how do they come to be perceived, what risks are real, how do they come to exist, what are the effects of perceiving risk, how can real risk be prevented, and how can negative effects of perceiving risk be prevented, with an eye towards both valid and invalid perceived risk.<p>In an effort to broadly treat the last two topics:<p>It is progressively easier to take advantage of people who rank lower on Kohlberg's stages of moral development:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_de...</a><p>An conception of the ideal of justice based on categorical imperatives (not necessarily in the Kantian sense) is not a guarantee of making the right decisions. However, it makes many decisions easier. It allows one to have sincere belief in their judgments about a situation, and to recognize irrational and unfair behavior before it has a chance of affecting oneself or others.<p>Compassion is excellent, but in too many cases trying to make a compassionate decision leads to feelings of uncertainty and powerlessness. Self-interest is necessary for survival, but in too many cases trying to make a selfish decision leads to feelings of isolation and unfairness. Laws are a necessary component of a free society, but they are written by flawed human beings, and often prescribe no choice at all or an obviously bad one.<p>Conversely:<p>Making decisions based on rationally chosen principles leads to a better situation for humanity as a whole. Contrast the success of the American revolution with the failure of the French revolution: George Washington adhered to the principles of justice and fairness and Napoleon did not.",1310144020

I've seen so much proclamation (<i>especially</i> on Hacker News) about how mobile and casual games are totally going to overtake console and PC gaming, and the current players are totally oblivious to this massive revolution.<p>No, no they aren't. Traditional gaming and the current mobile gaming are completely different experiences. It's like the difference between someone who plays games and a ""gamer"" (forgive my Scotsman here, it's for an analogy).<p>While both someone who plays games and a ""gamer"" might put in a decent amount of hours a week on Angry Birds, Tiny Wings, or whatever the mobile fad of the moment is, the ""gamer"" is not going to be as satisfied with that. They're going to be drooling over the latest videos for Skyrim, the next Battlefield game, or Deus Ex. A simple mobile game does not scratch that itch. They're completely different experiences, and I've gotten so tired of people equating the two.<p>It's like saying YouTube is going to overtake movies, because people totally love watching videos of cats. Sure, they spend hours doing that, but no matter how many cute animal videos, vlogs, or LPs they watch, it's never going to serve the same need as a nice big screen movie.<p></rant>",1310143959

Having done so, you make your own call. If you think the balance tips in favour of trying to recover the laptop, that is your opinion and I do not argue with your conclusion. But there is no ""culture of fear"" involved, there is simply a decision that differs from your own.<p>Now if you want to condone the idea of psycho-analyzing strangers based on their HN posts, I would encourage you to ask whether people who set out to recover the laptop are thinking strictly about the utility of the laptop, or whether they have an emotional desire to one-up the thieves or perhaps show the police up as inept.<p>Or maybe... And I encourage you to spend some quality time with a mirror while thinking about this... Maybe there is an emotional desire by some people to prove that they not afraid.

Ignoring that the hardware isn't going to be fast enough until Kal-El shows up (and even longer until Kal-El-type hardware is $150) the consoles also permit writing much closer to the metal than most mobile devices.<p>Consistent hardware is the reason consoles have been so attractive to develop for -- you don't have to worry about leaving 30% of your market behind because you want to use OpenGL ES 2.0, you don't worry about having performance differences between different phones, you don't worry about one configuration having multiple cores and another not. Microsoft went so far to ensure consistency in their hardware performance profile that when the Xbox 360 was moved from discrete CPU/GPU to a SoC for their new slim version they built a front-side bus on die.<p>Different hardware profiles is why AAA games just seemed to evaporate on the PC for a while. Even now with Direct3D 10 and 11 having given developers a much more stable target to aim for it's still a pain to develop for them. With the mobile market's mix of instruction sets (NEON, VFP, soft FP), graphics libraries (GLES 1.1, 2.0) and their different implementations (necessitating things like this: <a href=""http://aras-p.info/blog/2010/09/29/glsl-optimizer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aras-p.info/blog/2010/09/29/glsl-optimizer/</a>), plus core counts, clock speeds, screen sizes, and operating systems, it's getting worse in mobile than it was for PC.<p>For the most part console/PC games and mobile games are different in player usage too -- saying ""why play a console game when you can boot your phone or browser for 5-10 minutes at a time"" is like saying ""why watch a movie when you can watch cat videos on Youtube"". Different audience, different itches scratched.<p>As for the ""WebGL Rage"" demo, it's neat but it's very misleading.

2743112,comment,2739021,2742841,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"Yes.  On the 'porting', I can believe that!  However, I couldn't do the porting because I don't know C# syntax!<p>For ""classic VB"", I don't know that either!  I never used it.  For Windows programming, I just started with what you call 'VB.NET'.  I didn't mention 'classic VB' (or VB 6.0 or whatever it was) but tried to indicate that I am using the newer, most recent version of VB and am also heavily using .NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET.<p>On the 'porting', sure:  It appears that in effect Microsoft went 'language syntax agnostic', concentrated on the lower levels down toward the processors and Microsoft's 'common language runtime' (CLR), their 'intermediate language' or whatever they call it, etc. and in effect said that anyone was welcome to develop any 'syntactic sugar' on top they wanted.  Sounds like a good move to me.<p>I understand that C# offers a little that VB.NET does not, e.g., for 'reflection' or whatever, useful for writing polymorphic or more efficient late binding code.  Okay.  I'm trying to avoid using late binding.  For polymorphic code, mostly for object oriented programming, I'm just using .NET where I mostly don't have to think about polymorphism.<p>I have written a few classes and, then, a few polymorphic functions, but there I used interfaces which I regard as much the same I've done for decades with 'entry variables'.  The problem has always been, and still is, inside the polymorphic code, for each time touch the relevant data, have to call a function that is passed to the polymorphic code, and even just a little such usage can double or triple execution time of the polymorphic code.  Of course another way out is to use 'generics', but those go way back, also:  Basically just have the compiler write different versions of the code depending on the data types to be used.<p>Since VB.NET can be translated to C#, if I have to look at some C#, then I will imagine that I'm just looking at VB.NET with some 1-1 syntactic translations.<p>But the thread was concerned about training employees, and it seems to me that the syntax, semantics, etc. of VB.NET are so nice that, just for the language, the training should be fairly easy.<p>Moreover, in my work, nearly all the effort is just understanding the documentation for .NET, ASP.NET, and ADO.NET.  Then that understanding should be quite similar no matter what language is used to get to .NET, etc.<p>For understanding the basic VB.NET syntax and semantics themselves, that's from easy down to nearly trivial.  So, for my company, I'm trying to stay with VB.NET instead of C#:  Get what my company needs, have the code easier to read, and have training easier.<p>Yes, one of the nicer parts of VB.NET, and likely all the languages based on the CLR, and maybe not so easy for a beginner trying to understand and use, is the CLR 'garbage collection' (GC).  I was afraid that maybe each few seconds GC would wake up, put all the application logic on hold, do its GC, and then restart the application logic, but so far I've been pleased:  From some timings I've done, etc., I've seen no significant such intervals of 'application logic on hold'.  What will happen with VB.NET and GC on processors with many cores will be interesting to watch.<p>I don't know that the CLR, VB.NET, C#, the other Microsoft languages based on the CLR, and .NET are in all ways the best possible, but so far I'm pleased and thrilled.  E.g., they look solid enough for me to concentrate on my work for my company.<p>I've seen a lot in computing, including IBM's old efforts at some 'commonality' in the programming languages, etc., saw a lot of messes, and see what Microsoft has done as much better.  That they got GC working well is IMPRESSIVE -- they could have messed that up.  Microsoft could have made a huge mess out of the CLR, etc., but it appears so far that, instead, they did some good work.<p>What's comparable or good/bad in the Unix/Linux world I don't know.",1310142927

(See Exhibit 1.1 on pages 34 and 35 of the linked document for a beautiful example of a statistical chart comparing score levels in different countries.)<p>The international comparisons show that learners rise to higher expectations.

The reasoning, I think, is pretty simple.<p>Let me try to better explain what I'm trying to say, as a series of steps:<p>1. Teachers start treating everyone as smart<p>2. To treat everyone as gifted, more challenging material has to be introduced.<p>3. As a result of increased motivation/whatever, the size of the <i>gifted student</i> pool doubles. 80% of the class is still not at a gifted level.<p>4. <i>No Child Left Behind</i>, morality, failing students, angry parents come into play, and educators are forced to answer questions about the other 80%.<p>5. Two problems are now in play: First, there is the failing 80%. Second, of the 20% of gifted students, 10% is smarter than the other 10%.<p>6. Because there can be no tier separation of students (gifted/not gifted), material must be taught the same way, and the same material must be taught (otherwise, discrimination?)<p>7. Educators have a decision to make: Teach dull material that suits the last 10% and 80%, or teach engaging material that suits the top 10%, but is difficult for the second 10%, and near impossible for the 80%.<p>8. Choice A results in the top 10% of students losing out on an education, and Choice B results in 80% of the class failing.<p>9. I hate to bring this up for a very liberal and optimistic audience but: the 20-80 rule is very prevalent in society. It's inevitable that the top 10% will probably account for a good 50% or so of the nation's GDP and innovation when they're older (no, I have no evidence, but it makes sense).<p>Are you beginning to see my point? I went on a first-date last night, and compared my high school experience (didn't learn a thing, wasn't told about SATs, people were stabbed, no AP/IB) with my date's high school (UTS in Toronto... 2 entrance exams to get in, contests and opportunities made available, etc). I'll tell you now, that I feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunity. By changing education to this model, you'll find more people who feel that way (maybe not as extreme).<p>PS. My education was <i>so</i> bad, in fact, that by the time I took my SAT II subject tests, I know I needed 800s and I hadn't learned 70% of the material in Math II, Physics, or Chemistry. I bought books, and for the first time in high school, I actually studied.",1310141240

We've attained ""Skynet"" when computers can play ""the game of life"" against people and win.<p>The route of simulating a single human intelligence has been overdone by sci-fi writers and others who speculate about the singularity.  We'll be able to simulate a statistical model of a person,  derived from the output of millions of people,  much sooner than that.  The ""human memome"" required to do this already exists in everything we've written about ourselves -- it's a matter of learning how to mine it.<p>The simulation of human faculties,  on the other hand, is a business that's steadily progressing because it's useful.  No business really wants to hire thousands of call center workers or expensive legal research aids.  If we can simulate human faculties we can replace workers by machines,  so it's an entirely practical affair.<p>I don't care about consciousness,  souls or any of that.  If a system can perform,  if a system can pass,  that's good enough.  It's good enough for engineering and it's good enough for business.<p>As for critics of A.I. their main tactic is the conceit of moving the goalposts over time.  Years ago,  Charles Dreyfus would have said that the ability of humans to beat computers at chess proves that computers are stupid.

It's clear that this is useful.  Another is to have a larger capacity,  both in terms of short and long term memory.  It's not so clear what the limits are here because a human-like system might not scale well to a larger capacity.<p>Another way to improve on human is to be better at statistical reasoning.  People have certain systematic biases that cause them to make bad decisions.  This is particularly obvious because Poker is a good analogy for the ""game of life"" -- ultimately you've got to make guesses about what you can't see,  what will happen in the future, what people think about it,  and how they'll react.<p>So don't laugh because in a few decades,  better Bayesians will be taking your job,  eating your lunch and hopefully being better stewards of the world than we've been.",1310140977

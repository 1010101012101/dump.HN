I used to be all hardcore libertarian like that, but as I get older I lighten up and see that it's a bit too idealistic and leads to anarchy which doesn't really work well in practice.<p>Pure libertarianism focuses too much on individual rights without acknowledging the reality that we aren't born into such a world, we're social animals and we're born into large societies that we're <i>forced</i> to conform to which in may ways benefits us all, but hurts us as well.<p>No one gets rich or wealthy alone, they get it from society and that can't be a one way street.  Those people who have money to <i>spend on roads</i> only have it because of society, like it or not, the owe society something back for that.<p>Libertarians believe government doesn't work so the less there is the better, and this is <i>mostly</i> correct; big government doesn't work and can't because there is no one set of <i>rules</i> that all people will ever agree too, but local government, say city level, must work because the only alternative is lawlessness.  That being the case, ridding ourselves of federal influence would allow us to segregate into like minded communities where rules can be established that all agree to.  Some cities might want prayer in school, others might not, some want everyone to carry a gone while others want to outlaw guns, and that's as it should be, live and let live by recognizing that 300 million people won't ever agree so don't force them to.<p>The flaw in our society is not government, it's how big and non local we've let it become.",1217556571

People congratulating each other and joking with each other tend to be observable in several places. This is a place for smart discussion, yes, but not necessarily formal discussion.<p>Given that, then yes. I would absolutely say a line like that, expecting people listening in to understand that it's a piece of hyperbole rather than an actual belief.

And, if I was in a setting with reasonably bright people having a conversation, I would use the phrase ""stupid, ignorant fuck.""

We, the random folks in the audience, can't tell who has what case unless we know what the contract says. It could say anything. And it could say different things to a lawyer than it does to you.<p>If you signed a fixed-price contract, I can't see how you're going to be able to collect more than the total price of the contract, nor can I see how ""lost wages/loss of time"" comes into it. You're paid based on deliverables. If the site is literally finished except that the client refuses to accept delivery, it's probably fair to bill the client for 100% of the agreed amount, and to sue if they won't pay; otherwise, it's quite likely that the contract says that you're entitled only to the deposit. This is the scenario that deposits are designed for.<p>Again, though, IANAL and I haven't read your contract.<p>The moral here is: Work only so long as your client has a pulse. Ping the client regularly, and if you ping the client and nothing comes back... stop working and start sending out reminders/dire warnings instead (""if you do not send X I cannot do any more work"") until the client responds.<p>Contracting is risky work.

Thanks again to all of you who provided great feedback after the launch (I added a handful of features and fixed things mentioned). Streetread is an innovative, free webapp for Wall Street investors. It aggregators the headlines for all of the stocks you follow plus over 20 of the leading financial websites, in a nice, ajax-powered interface. Checking quotes and news is extremely easy - much quicker than the regular Google & Yahoo finance, etc.<p>Anyway, in the never-ending quest for good publicity and user growth, I'm having some problems. I've gotten about 7-10 great write ups that really helped the exposure (Lifehacker, Webware). The problem is, I've pitched to hundreds of sites, writers, bloggers, etc, and it seems I can't get much of a response anywhere. It also seems that even sites interested in doing write ups aren't going to be interested in a month old website. I'm running out of publicity ideas and people to pitch to. It's definitely not the type of site you run advertisements for. I truly feel that 9 out of 10 'hobby investors' seeing the site would be very interested. I see sites getting 5 figure registrations within days of launching and just wonder how.<p>Any suggestions?<p>Thanks.",1217556009

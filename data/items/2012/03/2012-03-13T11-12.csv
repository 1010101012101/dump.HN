3697955,comment,3697519,3697519,59,0,JunkDNA,,,"I worked in the drug R&D business for over 8 years. I still follow the industry closely. Some things always get lost in these discussions. First, <i>manufacturing</i> an existing drug is absurdly cheap. Modern industrial chemistry ensures this for all small molecule drugs (note that this is not the same case for the ""biologics"" which are often fiendishly difficult to make). Almost all the cost in a drug is the manufacturer recouping R&D costs. These costs have been spiraling out of control for 10 years. They are astronomical. A recent Forbes analysis pegs the cost of a new drug with failures of drugs in development folded in  anywhere from $3 billion to $12 billion depending on the manufacturer (excellent context and discussion here: <a href=""http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/02/10/the_terrifying_cost_of_a_new_drug.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pipeline.corante.com/archives/2012/02/10/the_terrifyi...</a>).<p>You don't need to be an industry expert to grok that those numbers are wildly unsustainable. It is not possible to keep spending the amount companies spend to make new drugs. In the past, companies would inflate the price in the USA to make up for reduced prices elsewhere. But with all the recent healthcare reform in the USA, that strategy is ending.<p>To add insult to injury, the vast majority of the most commonly used drugs will lose patent protection in the next couple of years. In the industry they call this the patent cliff. There will not be enough new drugs to offset all the ones that go generic.<p>This move by India is a symptom of the wider drug industry problems. There will be more of these kinds of moves in the future. The industry has been searching for ways to more effectively make drugs and have it not be so expensive. But so far they have been striking out for 10 years running. The current strategy is to lay off most of their r&d workforce and offshore and outsource this part of the business.<p>Somewhere out there, a business model is waiting to be found. Whoever cracks that nut and becomes the Southwest of the drug industry is going to make a fortune.",1331638998

  System and method for instant messaging using an e-mail

  Abstract
  Systems and methods allowing an instant messaging user to exchange messages with an e-mail user. 
  To the instant messaging user, the experience is a seamless exchange of instant messages; to the 
  e-mail user, the experience is a seamless exchange of e-mail messages. Conversion of an instant 
  message to an e-mail message includes insertion of a token into the e-mail message, and conversion
  of an e-mail message to an instant message includes validating a token extracted from the e-mail 
  message.

3697947,comment,3697519,3697842,3,0,ttt_,,,">> <i>however because of such decisions companies will find it risky to invest in life saving drug research.</i><p>I disagree. That mentality is precisely the reason that they are overpricing now (and always have done so) as much as they can. People will always need life saving drugs, and ordinary drugs as well. Terminal and cronical patients will always try both traditional and new drugs (or the state will provide it to them in case there is health care). There is absolutely no need to overprice because any price will eventually give a fair ROI for them.<p>What they do instead is maximize profit at the cost of human life.<p>On a different light, a lot of research is funded by government entities worldwide, and even if pharmaceutical companies do their own research, they certainly reference other research that is also publicly funded. Thankfully some states do care a lot about their people and will challenge them. India is doing so now, Brazil has also broken HIV drug patents (they cover the full cost of treatment through Health Care) and I hope to hear more of it from different places.",1331638780

Utopian socialists had similar visions of a future society but usually lacked the framework to clearly articulate their criticisms of existing societies).<p>The term Communism, although used since the XIX century, became mainstream in the XX as a reaction against the perceived reformism or capitulation against capitalism of the then-called ""socialist democrats"" of the Second International. Technically, though, Communism only means the end-goal of the socialist struggle, again a classless society where everyone works according to their capacity and receives according to their needs (see 'The Critique of the Gotha Program' by Marx, or Lenin's 'State and Revolution' where the distinction between the revolutionary transitional stage and the classless, stateless end-goal of Communism is clearly made. Yes, Lenin thought a society without any State at all was desirable). The fact that States ruled by Communist Parties implemented imperfect versions of socialism, or had any number of problems small or big, in no way should make you pretend that the definition of Communism is ""the government owns everything"". Or, much worse, that it is in some sense just the same thing than Fascism.

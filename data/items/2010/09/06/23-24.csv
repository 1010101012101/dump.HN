For those who don't know about a daily scrum, the idea is that you take 5-15 minutes (the shorter the time the better) first thing in the morning and everybody goes through briefly 1) What they did yesterday 2) What they're working on today 3) Anyone they need to sit down with to help them become unblocked / discuss a feature with.  Doing so every morning is a great way to keep everyone on the same page and provides a good balance between autonomous time and keeping everyone on the same page.<p>Doing this meeting while standing helps to keep the meeting short and to the point, and if you find yourself engaging in discussion about a particular feature / item / issue...""take it offline"". Don't use everyone's time to discuss something that should be discussed at a later time when everyone else could be in flow.",1283817207

If phones weren't subsidized, the list prices would be quite different.</i><p>No doubt it does not cost an extra $400, but don't make the mistake of assuming that in the absence of long-term contracts suddenly all prices will be based solely on production cost. See software for example. Does Photoshop really cost Adobe $X00 more than Photoshop Lite? No, they're both free. Companies will charge what they can, sometimes with highly varied pricing for products of similar cost, especially when the marginal cost of production is low but the cost of R&D is high.

The goal for telcos in the US and Canada is to lock you into a long-term contract, and high prices that no one is intended to pay help ensure that.<p>For example, Rogers (my wireless provider in Canada) offers a 3G USB modem for $250 without contract. I bought a near-identical prepaid modem from Vodafone in Germany this summer for 40 EUR. Or alternatively, take the iPod Touch. Apple sells the new 32GB model for $300, whereas an equivalent iPhone 4 is $700 off-contract. Does the 3G radio <i>really</i> add an extra $400?

He placed lots of bets on lots of systems, knowing that one would work out.  The IBM PC is what made their fortune.  But the bets they placed on other systems were already doing very well for them.  Including on Apple.<p>The Microsoft-Apple relationship began in 1977 with Microsoft introducing Applesoft BASIC and later licensing it to Apple.  Microsoft SoftCard followed in 1980, enabling Apple machines to run to programs designed for the CP/M.  Sure, there was the infamous MS-DOS deal with IBM.  But in the same time period Steve Jobs visited Microsoft to demo early prototypes of the Macintosh, and Microsoft was the first major company to develop programs for the Mac.  In the end Microsoft BASIC and Microsoft Multiplan were shipped simultaneously with the introduction of the Macintosh, and Microsoft announced at the launch that Word, Chart, and File would ship soon.<p>When I look back at the history, I see no sign that Bill Gates was betting against Steve Jobs.

In a low-profit enterprise, is it realistic to go for a 'boutique' experience and not focus on the highest ticket price?<p>I say this because I once was thinking of going into the airline biz as well. My angle was a first-class only airline. Refactor the entire check-in and boarding process. No more standing in lines to check your bags and then stand in line to get through security.<p>Drive up to the airport and your bags are unloaded and a valet takes your car, you're brought into the check-in lounge, and sit comfortably while you wait for a check-in agent to come by and check you in. Manage our own security process so again, no line-ups, we'll let you know when we're ready for you, just relax, enjoy a beverage, etc. etc.<p>Then, a plane which is full first-class has much fewer checked bags (carrying less people), so more room for cargo to improve margins. Plus with each ticket being a high-dollar, you've got good revenue rolling in (in theory anyway).<p>When I was thinking about this, I found an all first-class airline which was basing itself out of Las Vegas, but I can't remember what they where called, and they may not have made it off the ground.",1283814537

Scan the article if seems interesting and is not too long read it, if it is long scan it and read the comment page. If there is an interesting discussion read the article, else close the article and comments page.<p>After reading the full article, if good upvote. Read the comments, if there is an interesting conversation upvote (if still unvoted) article and comments. If I have something interesting to add. Comment.<p>After that, if an interesting conversation was taking place set a mental interruption on the future to recheck it.",1205697163

138350,story,,,1,1,michjeanty,"Startups high pre-money valuation is a killer",,"Startups like to raise fund at a high pre-money valuation. It's understandable; founders want to give up little % of their company for a lot of money. But that could be very dangerous, even fatal for startups/founders. When the company is new and unproven, it's better to raise capital at a low pre-money valuation. Founders know when the company is a few thousand line of code, or barely bringing revenue, it shouldn't be valued as high, but they raise the valuation bar anyway. Let's say the founder's wish come true, and the company gets acquired, which is the new business model for most startups now these days. Investors will get the money they invested and more, before founders get anything. Sometimes founders get nothing. It's never about founders get 45%, investors get 65% of the company's stocks. Investors always want to get their investment back, and possibly more... If taking 65% is higher than taking 10X their investment, they'll take 65%; if taking 10X their investment is higher than taking 65%, they'll take 10X their investment. Investors get paid before founders. In an acquisition, the higher the pre-money valuation is, the more likely investors will take all, if founders don't sell as high as their company pre-money valuation. Now days, before a startup gets out of beta phase, it's already valued at millions. Facebook barely bringing $200 million in revenue is valued at $15 billion. Even Mark Zuckerberg doesn't think his company worth that much. Digg.com barely has a business model, is valued at $200-$300 million. What happen to the good old fashion of buying low to sell high? Startups need to buy investor's money at a low pre-money valuation to exit the company high to make a profit.",1205696934

Your wee voice wants you to make something.</i><p><i>If you try to make something just to fit your uninformed view of some hypothetical market, you will fail. If you make something special and powerful and honest and true, you will succeed.</i><p><i>Frankly, I think you ºre better off doing something on the assumption that you will NOT be rewarded for it, that it will NOT receive the recognition it deserves, that it will NOT be worth the time and effort invested in it.</i><p><i>Nobody cares.

138342,comment,137226,137891,0,0,ngrandy,,,"hey bootload, thanks for your detailed response.  you raise a lot of good points.  we've definitely spent a lot of time thinking about these issues.<p>first, you're right that just extracting info from twitter doesn't require username and password.  our initial twitter interface is an update though, which does require authentication.<p>- we do use SSL for all usernames / passwords that are submitted, though we should make that clear, b/c right now we don't give an indication.<p>- because twitter does not offer token-based authentication, and because we do not currently want to store passwords, we are actually submitting to twitter via the web interface; that means we submit the u+p just once, and then we hold onto a cookie, but not the u+p.  when we login to twitter on your behalf, it is via https.<p>- one goal in the near / mid term is to give users a choice about the combination of privacy / convenience that they want.  right now we have opted on the side of privacy, since we're not storing usernames and passwords.  but some users have told us they would like wundrbar to basically act as a password manager, so we'll be building in that option.<p>- i hope twitter (and other sites) implement open auth soon, because i know there are alot of users who will be more comfortable using wundrbar through that authentication mechanism.",1205695687

138338,comment,137536,137536,0,0,duMont,,,"Not all H1-b visa holders are programmers. A good chunk of them are actually IT workers with specializations like implementing SAP, PeopleSoft etc ERP packages. Same for Database administrators. Even bigger than this list is the number of people engaged in maintaining some godforsaken legacy MIS or such software at a huge corporation.<p>While these jobs might not appeal to a hacker or a good computer science graduate, there are just too many such jobs. Most H1-b aspirants are quite happy to take them.<p>About the H1-b visas for foreign students at US universities, I think it is a good idea, though not at the numbers listed in the article. I think 30-40000 H1-b visas\nfor students graduating from US universties should be good enough to cater for the niche companies like Microsoft, Google etc. Imagine a Stanford or MIT graduate go away from US because he cannot work here? While not all students at MIT or Stanford is a foreigner, those who are there still have to apply from the same pool of H1-b visas which is open to just about any one.",1205695454

Were there no 2.0 betas?<p>I think a lot of this might be driven by marketers/advertisers trying to sell their clients on ""a new way"" of selling their content.  Remember when some company (Was it Slate.com?) came out with the full-page interstitial ad?  That was a new way of advertising content--wouldn't you say that would have earned atleast a Web 1.1 rating?<p>""Web 2.0"" _seems_ to be driven by sites being ""interactive"", I guess above and beyond just clicking around using 1.0(?) navigation.  Furthermore, elements like mob behavior (Digg), social networking, RIA expereinces seem to let someone slap 2.0 on their site--not that it's wrong, but that seems to be the criteria.  What else might I be missing in that list?<p>What would you call Hacker News?  Just because it's born in the Web 2.0 ""era"", does it make it so?",1205695400

""I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time,"" he says. He predicts, apparently seriously, that every young person one day will be entitled automatically to change his or her name on reaching adulthood in order to disown youthful hijinks stored on their friends' social media sites.<p>Which makes sense to me. Hell, I wish I could delete some videos and/or photos of me on various sites.<p>Lately Schmidt has been making statements like this though; they are reasonable when complete, but some reporters snip out five words (or, just paraphrase or interpret) and create a news storm.

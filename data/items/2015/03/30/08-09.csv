The first 4 miles are in town, with lots of crossings, lights, etc. The middle 92 miles are on highways with a few turn offs. The final 4 miles are back in town with lights and crossings again. let&#x27;s assume UK speed limits for everything (30mph in town, 70mph on highways). We&#x27;ll ignore acceleration.<p>In an autonomous car you can do the speed limit for the entire journey. That&#x27;s 8 miles at 30mph and 92 miles at 70mph. The journey takes you 95 minutes.<p>In the human-driven car you&#x27;re slowed to an average of 20mph in town, but on the highway you travel at 85mph because that&#x27;s what everyone else does. The journey takes you 89 minutes.<p>Obviously the 95 minutes in the autonomous car can be a <i>productive</i> 95 minutes whereas driving yourself you can&#x27;t do much else for those 89 minutes, which is a huge difference, but until <i>all the cars</i> are autonomous (or there are superfast autonomous lanes at least) then it&#x27;s probably going to be quicker to drive yourself because to a human a speed limit is a guideline rather than a rule.",1427705835

9288377,comment,9286442,9287114,0,0,DanBC,,,"> Low-to-moderate alcohol use has been shown to have significant health benefits over the long-term.<p>There is a well publicised study that claims that, but it&#x27;s been pretty heavily criticised. It turns out that only women over 65 get benefits from moderate drinking.  Everyone else needs to restrict themselves to light drinking to get the benefits.<p>That&#x27;s an important distinction because few people know how much they actually drink.  People tend to under-estimate the number of glasses they have, and under-estimate the size of the glasses, and under estimate the amount of alcohol in each glass.<p>You&#x27;ve said that 3 beers produces a de-stress result. It&#x27;s not clear what you mean by &quot;strong&quot; - 5%? 8%? 10%? Three pints of beer at 5% ABV are 2.8 units each, about 8.5 units for all three. This is no where near risky drinking (unless you do it more than twice a week) but it is wrong to suggest that it is a healthy activity.<p>Alcohol is not just a problem for those who start yumg or who&#x27;ve had abusive childhoods.  Alcohol is a causal factor in many deaths and accidental injuries; alcohol is involved in many suicide attempts; alcohol is involved in a lot of violence.  It is wrong to suggest that all those people started drinking young or had abusive backgrounds.<p><a href=""http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h384"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h384</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9043577"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9043577</a><p><a href=""http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/put-down-the-booze-drinking-may-not-be-good-for-you"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psmag.com/health-and-behavior/put-down-the-booze-...</a>",1427705759

9288374,comment,9286906,9288069,0,0,usds_hiring,,,"This isn&#x27;t a one-time thing, let me tell you about my experience. (Throwaway, for obvious reasons.)<p>But first a little about me: CS degree, straight to engineering at blue-chip tech companies, did full stack development, then moved to product management, with a bit of project management experience jumbled in. I&#x27;m probably not the guy you want banging out 20K LoC/day on the Linux kernel, but I am the guy who can sketch out both the UI and the architecture of a new product, hold the big picture in his head on the one hand and still speak intelligently to specialists about minute details on the other hand. Fixing all the broken systems in government sounded like a dream job at the time. I thought I was a good fit from everything I heard.<p>I initially reached out to you, Brandon, around the second big round of press that USDS got -- summer/fall 2014ish. You helpfully put me in touch with J.<p>J rescheduled our calls twice. It&#x27;s fine, shit happens. When we did get on the phone though, after explaining the above (with more evidence), she asked me if I wanted to do web-dev with 18F. No, I did not want to do web-dev with 18F, and there&#x27;s very little in my background to suggest I&#x27;d be a good fit for web development. She flat out told me she didn&#x27;t think I could hack it at USDS, but when I asked where she thought I wasn&#x27;t a good fit, she backed down and said she&#x27;d get an engineer to interview me.<p>Next thing I know, I get an email from H @ 18F, who I understand is a manager there, and says that J said I wanted to speak to her. Okay, fine, I figure what&#x27;s the harm in a conversation? I respond that I&#x27;d be happy to chat.<p>A month goes by, no response to 2-3 emails to J (or H).<p>Finally J responds, so sorry, got busy, etc. Alright, fine, shit happens I guess. The call with the engineer is set up. The engineer and I speak, technical stuff, no phone-coding though (yay!). Seems to have gone well. I give it a week, no sign of life, so I email: nothing. I let two more weeks go by, email again: nothing. Two months later (by now I was just doing this for the curiosity): nothing.<p>So. Maybe there&#x27;s political will. Maybe they&#x27;re bipartisan support. But I doubt you&#x27;re hiring the best and brightest. Because hiring the best people is job #1 of any leadership team, and the best and brightest know that if this is the hiring process, run by deputy directors of these organizations, with the deputy CTO of the US cc&#x27;d on all these emails, and it&#x27;s _this_ bad...well, it can only be even worse on the inside. And all the desire to give back and serve your country falls apart when you know that organization is going to hamstring you when it comes to the &quot;giving back&quot; and &quot;serving your country&quot; parts of the job description.<p>Oh, but what about H/18F, you&#x27;re wondering? Over the course of 8 months (half of that time radio silence), I&#x27;ve scheduled 5 phone calls with her, and she&#x27;s missed every single one, most of them without a courtesy email saying she&#x27;d have to cancel before the call. It got to the point where I was scheduling them during times I knew I&#x27;d be driving  or waiting around at places because I didn&#x27;t want to waste anymore hours sitting by a phone that was unlikely to ring.<p>So yeah, there was no &quot;bait and switch&quot; here, just the &quot;bait and&quot;. Not that I&#x27;m irritated by this or anything...",1427705712

If you want to target JS today, you should use it.<p>By contrast, TARDISgo not only targets JS, it also targets C++, C# and Java (plus some other minor languages). In addition it gives access to the rich Haxe cross-platform development ecosystem.<p>I am actively developing the project, but that work is not yet visible on GitHub because of breaking changes in the Haxe compiler. The project will get a major upgrade once it is stable with the new version of Haxe (3.2.0). This upgrade will raise the number of standard packages which pass their tests (for at least one target language) to 80.<p>Major announcements about TARDISgo will appear on twitter @TARDISgo.

I agree that in some cases they do add value; trying to prove the correctness of a distributed protocol in any other way is dumb.

So I’ll throw a little more gas on and add some history.<p>In 1997 I’d wake up each morning after maybe 5 or 6 hours of sleep, shower and get dressed, wake up my 4 year old daughter, feed her and dress her, and then take her to daycare.  Then I’d go to work and one of the first things I’d do is read through the late night checkins.  I was Bharat’s manager.  Ray’s story is legit.<p>Bharat had checked in a feature late one night, without a code review, and hoodwinked a junior PM into okaying the “spec”, which I found out later was not much more than a scribble on his whiteboard.  First I dropped by the the PM’s manager’s office (who now heads up code.org, and who apparently chewed out the PM after I left him) and then I went to chew out Bharat.  That’s just the way it worked - I knew I’d be getting a call (we had phones back then, on our desks) from my manager.  Of course Bharat wasn’t there - it was like 930 in the morning.<p>Eventually I did chase down Bharat later that day.  I was unhappy because a) I hated the implementation - it should have been a link-rel or something similar that didn’t invoke an extra http request, b) I knew based on the way he’d leveraged the IE cache to store the .ico file that if the user ever manually flushed the cache the file would get deleted but the cache index would not get nuked -ie. he checked it in with a difficult to fix bug c) the code hadn’t been reviewed (which was stupid, rare, a potential firing offense, but most importantly could get you assaulted by the thugs who lurked in building 26).  It was never a problem that he hoodwinked the junior PM - just funny.<p>In the end, we agreed he’d get the code reviewed ASAP and he’d fix the bug.  The code review happened within the hour (Bharat’s code was fine, but years later it was found that the lower level code it called resulted in ms99-018).  The second didn’t - the bug entered and then later got pushed to the next release by one of the PMs.  Then Bharat left, and I left, and others… and the bug lingered for years.  I’d send whiny emails every couple months about it to the folks still working on IE and… fixing the bug got pushed the next couple releases.  I can’t remember when it was finally fixed, but someone forwarded me the checkin mail when it did… I wish I’d kept it.<p>At any time that week that Bharat checked in the feature I could have sent an email and the checkin would have been backed out. I did hate the implementation… but I liked the feature.  It had nothing to do with somehow “screwing Netscape”.  It was just a nice, simple, cool feature - easy for web-devs to take advantage of, nice for users.<p>So the bureaucracy broke down that day, and the result was a popular, inefficient, buggy feature.  The right call?  Ray says it was.  For me it was one of thousands of calls that we all have to make in a career, most right, some wrong, and some will be debated forever.  I guess this is the latter.  Move on.<p>Maybe UnoriginalGuy can get his ideas in some standard and implemented in Chrome or Safari.  Or he could just check some code in late one night when nobody&#x27;s around to stop him - I&#x27;m sure Ray will okay the spec ;-)",1427703920

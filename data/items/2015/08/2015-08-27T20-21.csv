Here&#x27;s some actual advice I gleaned from the article:<p>- Say, &quot;We’re going to make this decision before we leave the room.&quot; (And do it.)<p>- Begin every decision-making process by considering how much time and effort that decision is worth, who needs to have input, and <i></i>when you’ll have an answer<i></i>.<p>- Internalize how irreversible, fatal, or non-fatal a decision may be. (And get comfortable with it.)<p>- Give important decisions 24 hours, even if you think you know the answer.<p>- Know when to end debate and make a decision. Use your  &quot;CEO prerogative&quot; sparingly but decisively.<p>- Gauge comfort to get to the right speed: low-level discomfort (stretching) is good.<p>Then execute on those decisions.

In fact, the scales contained in the Tune.js archive come from the Max Magic Microtuner .mtx archive, which was compiled from the Scala .scl archive. It seems the .scl archive has surpassed the .mtx one, which I think was last updated by Victor Cerullo in 2010. I&#x27;ll have to try to integrate the new additions to Scala into the tune.js library. I&#x27;d also like to add functionality where you can define your own scale. Maybe for version 2.0!<p>As to your point about pitch variation in microtonal music, that is often the case in a lot of traditional musics that make use of microtones, for sure. It is part of the character of a lot of that music, and some of the Irish music that you mention, to have a lot of subtle variation and microtonal embellishments. I read somewhere that non-fixed pitch instruments, such as violins or the voice, tend toward pure intervals naturally.<p>But there is a lot of music on fixed pitch microtonal instruments, such as the music and instruments of Harry Partch, La Monte Young&#x27;s Well Tuned Piano, and refretted guitars.<p>Lastly, you could definitely program the kind of variation and fluidity into the web audio instruments that you use with tune.js. The demo just uses a piano sample for demonstration, and to have long sustain to hear the microtonal harmonies. I would love to hear this used with more portamento or with a pitch bend function, to get more natural variation.<p>Thanks for sharing the Irish music links, I&#x27;ll definitely take a look!",1440708289

As hard as that is, it did make some sense since the company was contracted to design and develop some of the hardware and low-level software for a major gaming console (will remain nameless). The project failed for several reasons, but one of them was that only a couple people on the team understood games and the gaming industry. Even though from an engineering perspective we could easily build a console, we also had to make a great user/gaming experience which we had no experience with as a company. The result was that great engineers were making horrible product decisions because they didnt understand video games.<p>The solution to that specific problem would have been to hire good people who understand games and teach everyone else about games and the gaming industry. That way the great engineers would be able to make great product decisions within the context of gaming.<p>Or more generally, one of the jobs of a founder is to build a business whose culture is more likely to produce good product decisions given the context of who the users are, the product, and the industry. One of the ideas I like a lot to accomplish this is to make engineers do customer service. When an engineer gets the same bug report three times, they are more likely to fix it sooner rather than later.",1440707486

The key is how you break up the heavy task into pieces that can be distributed more evenly on the event loop instead of blocking it. For example processing a huge data stream is typically done by breaking it into chunks where each chunk can be processed in a few ms, rather than doing one giant blocking operation on the entire stream.<p>Done properly this also leads to a low memory process that will grab data from an incoming socket stream, transform it, then push that data back out through an outgoing socket stream, only ever keeping a few MB of the stream in working memory at a time. Slap a cluster of these streaming processes together running on a single box to utilize all CPU cores and you can easily push many Mbps of IO through your server quickly and efficiently.<p>Additionally even if you do have a heavy blocking system IO operation that you can&#x27;t break up very well you can increase `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` when needed to reduce the impact of the blocking.",1440707420

Employees very rarely make a lot of money after an acquisition.<p>Yes, I believe that is what you claimed previously. You also seemed to suggest that it was deservedly so (that employees not share in the &quot;big chunk of money&quot;)?<p>> People may not care about your big dream of saving the world<p>You&#x27;re changing the parameters. I&#x27;m assuming you only care that your product is going to &quot;catch on and make a shitload of money&quot;.<p>The employees are manifesting the product and are the ones who have invested their life in the company. I believe you claimed that employees do not &quot;put their ass on the line&quot; and therefore don&#x27;t get to share in the &quot;big reward&quot;? What qualifies as putting your ass on the line?<p>>I never said that.<p>I didn&#x27;t say that you said that. I&#x27;m saying that what you are describing fits into the more general framework of alienated labor. Feelings of alienation occur when there is little to no connection between the one doing the work and the work itself, which sounds pretty much exactly like what you described. If the game is reduced to &quot;shut up and do what you&#x27;re told because I write the check&quot; and the employee requires that check to survive, the employee is at high risk of losing autonomy over their work as they may become ever more dependent on their founders and investors (founders and investors may openly exploit this fact). At the same time, the founders and investors may be extracting ever more value from from the company (by which I mean, the employees).<p>I don&#x27;t think alienation of labor is a single binary condition. Some work is more alienating than others for various reasons, including founders, investors, managers, colleagues, product, workplace conditions, tasks assigned, etc.<p>Many people find it alienating to hear founders and investors talk about how they are going to make a shit-ton of money all while claiming that the people doing the actual work haven&#x27;t put their ass on the line and won&#x27;t share in the big reward that they are all working to realize.",1440707111

Despite the fact that fuel rods melted in both cases (thus both were &quot;meltdowns&quot;), there is an extraordinary difference between fuel rods overheating in a cooling pond and explosive breach of a critical reactor in a runaway condition.  It&#x27;s like classifying a campfire and the Hindenburg together because both are combustion - both can certainly burn you, but they&#x27;re fundamentally dislike in intensity, scale, and kind.<p>Most of the really nasty stuff (high-level actinide waste) is highly radioactive <i>because</i> it decays so quickly.  After the reactor is shut down and the fuel rods are removed, all that stuff is gone, whereas breach of a <i>critical</i> reactor results in the release of that stuff.  The byproducts of a fuel fire is stuff like radioiodine and radiocaesium - it&#x27;s not healthy by any means, if ingested it will elevate the risk of cancer over the long term, but it&#x27;s not instadeath like actinide waste.<p>&quot;What is expected to happen in Fukushima&quot; is nothing like what happened to Chernobyl.

If you accept #1 and #2, you can&#x27;t start with a language with the full &#x27;magic&#x27; of garbage collection, as it would have to be the only language, and you cannot teach #2 with it.<p>If, in addition, you accept #3, ARC makes sense to me.

&quot;I’ve long believed that speed is the ultimate weapon in business. All else being equal, the fastest company in any market will win. Speed is a defining characteristic — if not the defining characteristic — of the leader in virtually every industry you look at.<p>In tech, speed is seen primarily as an asset in product development. Hence the “move fast and break things” mentality, the commitment to minimum viable products and agile development. Many people would agree that speed and agility are how you win when it comes to product.<p>What they fail to grasp is that speed matters to the rest of the business too — not just product. Google is fast. General Motors is slow. Startups are fast. Big companies are slow. It’s pretty clear that fast equals good, but there’s relatively little written about how to develop the institutional and employee muscle necessary to make speed a serious competitive advantage.&quot;
====<p>A few sentences from this excerpt stood out to me, particularly the &quot;fast equals good&quot; statement. Is this a generally agreed upon belief in the community here?

That aside, and if you don&#x27;t believe me fine, but most military guys will lose quickly to even an average BJJ blue belt. I&#x27;ve seen it many times, and anyone at an MMA or grappling school near a military base should be able to confirm as well.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatives#Modern_Army_Combatives"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combatives#Modern_Army_Combati...</a><p>><i>They also concentrate on fighting on the ground which is pretty fucking useless IRL. It&#x27;s also useless against say multiple opponents. Or are you expecting them to wait for you to choke them out one by one?</i><p>Except it&#x27;s completely not. Sure, ground fighting works best (imo) in a one-on-one fight against unarmed opponents, but if you&#x27;re attacked by a team of people with serious weapons you&#x27;re probably screwed anyway. BJJ (if that&#x27;s the one we&#x27;re focusing on) also involves a lot of wrestling, judo, position control, etc. No one forces you to go to the ground, and a lot of the actual Gracie self-defense stuff involves standing escape type techniques - &quot;break the grip and get away.&quot; And again, it doesn&#x27;t take long to choke someone out, a few seconds if the grip is right, and even less to just rip a shoulder or break a wrist. You can finish a kimura standing, for example, it&#x27;s just easier to get out of if the person knows how to defend it.<p>><i>A boxer learns to fight in accordance with some rules... he&#x27;s at a disadvantage because he&#x27;s not expecting someone to say kick his knee out.</i><p>Opening up leg strikes certainly changes the game, but experienced boxers will have extensive practice in controlling their position, distance, making angles and avoiding strikes. If this comparison is still between people doing full-contact styles with live training, versus people not, he still has a huge advantage over an opponent with no practice in an actual combat situation.<p>You seem to be alluding to styles where people somehow practice &quot;lethal&quot; techniques in an effective manner without neutering the effectiveness of their training, but provide no suggestions of what styles and schools those are. If you could provide some examples it would be more convincing.<p>><i>What am I supposed to do with this statement. Maybe you are just a shit grappler.</i><p>Maybe drop the attitude?

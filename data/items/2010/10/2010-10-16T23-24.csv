Now for a great deal of humanity, leisure fairly quickly becomes boredom, and booze or philandering are required to maintain sanity. But for the occasional born artist, historian, etc, the Henry James, the Edith Wharton, that can be tremendously productive.<p>Would I trade that for 21st century medicine or dentistry?

However, one doesn't arrive at a solution away from the computer. Napkins don't compile.)<p>Writing code in an interview will tell you one of two things:<p>1. This person has encountered the problem before and is simply regurgitating the solution they came to when they had four months to work on it and the assistance of a TA and other students.<p>2. This person has not encountered the problem before.<p>While the latter case is considered ideal, it only works if you know how to ask the proper questions. I suggest avoiding it because there are more direct ways to get what you want to know.<p>My suggestion? Code reviews. Have some pre-made examples or ask the candidate to bring their own code.

That is that the perceived cost of production has a big influence on the emotional reaction to the price of the good even though it has no tangible effect on the utility of that good.<p>This has a basis in the fact that high-cost goods do require high prices in order to have margins and that competition does push margins closer to costs.  But, most people learn about these effects in the checkout line rather than econ classes. From those experiences, the explanation a lot of people have come up with is ""If its cheaper to make, charging as much or more for it is mean.""",1287273204

1799189,comment,1799126,1799126,0,0,_delirium,,,"The article seems slightly different from its title. What the body seems to conclude is: 1) the available evidence of ancient cancers is too sparse to conclude anything, given that even ""common"" cancers would be fairly uncommon in a population of only a few hundred mummies and few thousand skeletons, most of whom died before age 50; and 2) if there is an increase in cancers, it's probably due to preventable lifestyle things like smoking, rather than pollution or other background causes more generally.<p>In particular, the second part seems to cut against their original point: they first say cancer isn't a disease of the modern world, and then they say well, maybe it is more common, but if so it's mostly because of lifestyle factors.<p>Both those points do seem likely to be correct, though.",1287273177

The interview process has a built in selection bias, so people doing interviews go crazy because most people they see are ass hats.<p>And about white boards -- there are lots of subjects where I have good experience, but not recent enough to do a white board test.

1799160,comment,1798241,1798241,0,0,mjfern,,,"This article by Fred Wilson (AVC) highlights the rise of Android and ARM as the dominant players (and standard) in the next wave of computing (along with Apple and others as strong niche players).<p>For the last several decades, the Wintel standard has dominated personal computing (PC). If we look at current market share data, Microsoft’s and Intel’s position in the PC market appears unassailable. As of September 2010, the Windows OS controlled 91% of the PC market (Net Applications, 2010), while Intel microprocessors controlled just over 80% (IDC, 2010).<p>But what if personal computing is shifting away from desktops and packaged applications, the stronghold of Windows and Intel, to a combination of “thin devices,” cloud computing, and online media? Thin devices are smartphones, tablets, connected televisions, and a myriad of other devices that connect to the cloud to access various online media, from video to social networking.<p>In view of this transition, the future actually looks quite bleak for Microsoft and Intel, despite their strong position in the PC market. Microsoft has struggled mightily in the smartphone and online media markets, and is reluctant to aggressively enter the cloud in fear that it will cannibalize sales of Windows and Office. Meanwhile Intel has struggled to produce microprocessors that appeal to thin device OEMs, where energy efficiency is prioritized over sheer computing power.<p>If Microsoft and Intel, and the Wintel standard are fading, then which companies and which standards are rising? Apple has been pushing the frontier in computing with its collection of thin devices (iPod Touch, iPhone, iPad, the Apple TV) and its media platforms (iTunes and the App Store). Google has also invested substantially in these new computing markets with Android on thin devices (smartphones, tablets, smartbooks, set-top boxes, and connected televisions) and Google’s growing suite of cloud services (e.g., Gmail, Maps, YouTube, Android Market).<p>Looking at current trends, it appears that the diffusion of Android and ARM may be accelerating past competitors. Recent NPD and Nielsen data indicate that Android sales have now overtaken Apple’s iOS and Blackberry’s RIM in the smartphone market. And analyst Paul Morland of KBC Peel Hunt estimates ARM’s market share in microprocessors will increase from 29% to 40% from 2010-2014.  Meanwhile Android and ARM are on the cusp of rising in emerging device markets, such as tablets and connected televisions.<p>If the last several decades of personal computing was dominated by the Wintel standard, with AMD and Apple as the scrappy competitors. It appears the future of computing may be dominated by Armdroid (or a slight variant based on the Google Chrome OS), with Apple and several others as strong niche players.  Of course there will be other companies that will rise and sustain their position as dominant players in other segments of computing, from enterprise cloud services (e.g., Salesforce.com) to online video (e.g., Netflix), and online retail (e.g., Amazon).<p>I just posted this to my blog and submitted the post to HN. If you enjoyed the read, I'd appreciate an upvote (the article title is ""Armdroid""). Thanks!",1287272436

Giving people the ability to easily structure and sort what they like seems like exactly the right thing to do.<p>I would think that it would be an excellent idea to continue on focusing on exactly that instead of adding shiny features. Recipe apps have to fight proven and battle tested procedures already in place in any kitchen worth its name for collecting and organizing recipes. (I know: 1. Print it out. 2. Put it in transparencies. 3. Put them into a folder. Easy and robust.)<p>I can think of several things that could help you streamline that process and fight the good fight against paper. Apps have benefits but they are slight so it’s not easy.<p>You could try to further automate the recognition of recipes on sites you don’t yet know. Try to prefill if you can, the standard selection process of the iPad is not all that much fun to use. If everything else fails don’t force your users to go through that tedious selection process, allow them to save the webpage wholesale. Lower, lower, lower the boundaries of saving a recipe.

I don't think that can suffer from integer overflow.  But it might suffer from floating-point rounding problems.<p>Of course you could always go with the <i>boring</i> solution:<p><pre><code>  if a > b:    swap( a, b )

1799121,comment,1798717,1799062,0,0,dgallagher,,,"Great question.<p>Generally, I tend to have certain ingredients always-on-hand. There are others which I buy occasionally but don't always have. And of course things do run out as the week progresses. In a nutshell, having to re-enter everything every time would be tedious.  But imagine this...<p>The app keeps a history of food you've entered into it already. When you load it up it displays foods as icons. There's a picture of your kitchen (fridge/shelf) with food icons sitting in it. This is what you have now, and you can drag/drop food into your kitchen. There's also a side-bar shelf, your ""food history"". This is stuff that you ran out of. Drag/drop food to/from here into your kitchen, and suddenly you have a visual inventory management system that isn't just some giant cumbersome UITableView.<p>Ideally you could add/remove stuff from your food history. It would end up being a general list of all the food you ""usually"" buy. Initially populating that list would be time-consuming, but afterwords it would be fairly easy to keep things updated. You could also mark an ingredient as ""rare"", and tell the app not to save if for later in your history.<p>This wouldn't work so well for someone who has a high-turnover of ingredients, and buys a fairly large variety of different stuff. But my hunch is that most people likely buy the same stuff over the course of a month or two. I'm not sure if that's true of everyone, but if it is, an easy-to-use inventory management system like/similar to what I described might work out good. I'd definitely use it; the benefit from shuffling around a virtual inventory for a few minutes would pay for the experience to eat something different/new, rather than settling for the same-old.",1287271189

I have an older phone where you have to read each text message as a separate message, and it causes a bit of an expectations mismatch when I'm texting with someone who's using a client that makes it look like a chat window.<p>I usually send something concise but information-packed, sort of like a tweet, and minimize separate texts. So I might send something like:<p><pre><code>  just got downtown, at cafe whatever. heard from jim?
</code></pre>
But if I had a chat-like interface on my phone, I might write three separate messages,<p><pre><code>  just got downtown
  at cafe whatever
  heard from jim?
</code></pre>
For me, the latter style is <i>really</i> annoying to receive, because it gets queued as a series of incoming messages I have to read and dismiss separately, but I think that's becoming less common on newer phones. If I switched to that style, I could easily see sending 3x+ more messages without actually changing how much information I send.",1287270928

If you have a loop and annotate the loop control variable as int, but it flows into expressions that evaluate arithmetic, then per the unchanged-from-JS rules, you get IEEE754 double evaluation. This means widening not wraparound on overflow. It is non-trivial to optimize to remain in the ALU. But the int storage type means stores have to be narrowed correctly from double to int.<p>Not annotating the loop control variable lets two things happen: 1) everything on the FPU, which if SSE has a lot of bandwidth in parallel to the integer units, which can still handle addressing and known-int chores; 2) tracing JITs can speculate, and type inferencing JITs can infer, that the loop control fits in an int, and all evaluation and storage can use int domain.",1287270362

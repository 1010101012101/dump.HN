3723688,comment,3721181,3722556,1,0,runeks,,,"I believe you are not looking for an alternative bank; you are looking for an alternative currency. The Federal Reserve gives explicit rights to private banks to <i>not</i> have to worry about whether the US Dollars in their possession are 100% backed up by actual reserves of US Dollars. In fact, they encourage banks to <i>not</i> be able to pay you back, through fractional reserve banking, if everyone were to withdraw their deposits. The Federal Reserve has a complete monopoly over how the US Dollar is managed in electronic form. I'm not even sure that a bank that refuses to participate in fractional reserve banking will be allowed to operate, or at least that you will be covered by the official deposit guarantee in case they go bankrupt.
I realize there really are no alternatives, which makes my advice somewhat useless, but by using US Dollars (or any other state paper currency) you are supporting the current monetary system (which includes the private banks).",1332161963

They have ahuge number of programmers, the development is much more distributed into different locations and time zones, and the release cycles are much smaller than they used to be with large codebases in the past. Theres for example this very interesting discussion about the way these companies use their versioning systems:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3548824"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3548824</a><p>Some of the practices (like keeping their whole codebase in one big repository) look quite questionable, if not downright stupid from a smaller viewpoint, but make sense in their case. Go could be a similar thing  most serious languages are designed with good modularization, encapsulation and other features that support large scale code bases as most of us know them, but that does not mean these languages are a great match for software at the Google scale.",1332161957

(Voicemail and word processors made secretaries obsolete in many organizations, for instance). But in practice, work has simply grown more complex and more voluminous to accommodate the productivity gains.<p>Consider the humble spreadsheet, arguably the most powerful business innovation of the last 50 years. Now that people can calculate complex models in hours, not weeks, have the fields of corporate finance and forecasting gone away? Hardly. If anything, more work gets packed into each day to fill the vacuum left by not having to crunch numbers on paper for days on end. And the level of sophistication going into deal analysis has increased, allowing people to spend more time planning and less time bean-counting.<p>Sure, some jobs have been in outright decline since the rise of technology. Secretaries, human computers (sorry, Frank Herbert!), many factory workers, and so forth. But the net amount of work to be done hasn't decreased. If anything, it's increased dramatically. It's just shifted to the knowledge-worker side. And knowledge workers' workloads have skyrocketed. All of this technology has actually made us busier and more productive, because it has allowed us to do more each day.<p>The theory that technology replaces the need for X or Y work is based on the flawed assumption that the total need for X or Y work remains static over time. In the knowledge worker's domain, it does not. It turns out that meeting the need for X and Y actually increases the need for, or at least the expectation of, more X and Y. In this sense, I tend to agree with PG's argument (and the arguments of those like him).",1332161341

The Shuttle program was a bill of goods that never lived up to any of the claims it was sold on. Not only was it one of the most dangerous orbital launch systems in history it was far and away the most expensive heavily used launch vehicle in history. It came very close to dooming all spaceflight, manned and unmanned, in the US on at least three separate occasions. But the one thing it did better than ever was funnel billions of dollars a year to high paying aerospace jobs in key congressional districts.<p>And now we have the so-called Space Launch System. Another boondoggle jobs program that is so ridiculous that fundamentals of its design have been specified by the Senate itself. The Planetary Society, Space Access Society, and the Space Frontier Foundation have all called for the SLS to be cancelled. It's a poorly designed rocket, a huge waste of money, and overall a project that is not likely to succeed.<p>I love space exploration. I love rocket engineers. But I cannot abide either being abused to serve as pawns in congressional pork-barrel spending games.<p>This is not a question about what NASA manned spaceflight ""needs"", it's a question about where the Senate wants to funnel money.<p>NASA manned spaceflight has spent a quarter of a trillion dollars over the last 4 decades.<p>A quarter of a trillion dollars.<p>That is the cost of the Shuttle legacy and the ISS. Does anyone think that we, the American taxpayers, actually got a pretty good return on that money? Before you answer keep in mind that we could have easily paid for 150+ Saturn V rockets as well as the appropriate payloads and spacecraft for them for less money.<p>Meanwhile, companies like SpaceX have managed to build entire orbital launchers from scratch for less than the cost of a single Shuttle flight.<p><i>None</i> of the alternative uses for that money are as important? How about using that $10 billion a year to buy commercial flights on Boeing, LockMart, or SpaceX rockets? Right now only a fraction of NASA's funding is actually serving the purpose of advancing the state of the art or improving access to space.<p>There is an argument about whether the amount of money governments spend on various activities could be better spent on spaceflight.<p>This is not that argument and has no bearing here. This is an argument about whether NASA is a good conduit for spending money on manned spaceflight activities. And there is overwhelming evidence that despite a handful of successes it has not been. Over time it has gotten less efficient, less safety conscious, and less capable. There is every indication that with Apollo era budgets in place the NASA of today would not be able to get back to the Moon in 10 years or even 20 years.<p>The unmanned spaceflight portion of NASA still does some pretty good work, but the manned spaceflight portion has become a bureaucratic infused pork-barrel shell of its former glory. There are lots of reasons for that, a lot of them due to consistent political meddling from without, but it's still the truth.",1332160532

But that just goes back to why private money is smarter - it's not allowed near senators who each want their slice of cake. The current SLS (waggishly called the senate launch system in some circles) has had most of its major technical decisions made on the basis of politics - eg having to use shuttle derived solid rocket boosters to keep that factory open. I think Apollo only got away with it because money was no object.<p>Again I think this is where the strength of SpaceX lies (modulo the obvious like hiring smart and/or very experienced people) - they are quite free of all this nonsense, their PMs and designers and fabricators are all under once roof and can close the loop on design and manufacturing feedback and iteration. It's very much like skunkworks back in the day.<p>Having said all that, they're not immune to interference. Dealing with NASA and the ISS means you have to renormalise what constitutes 'exciting' and 'newsworthy' so where in the early days we had things about engines tests and re-entry tests, now we get releases beginning with sentences like 'Today, Space Exploration Technologies (SpaceX) announced it has successfully completed the preliminary design review...'[1]. I've worked on projects with which NASA or ESA have suddenly got involved and I've seen first hand how the innocence get lost, you go from running to wading through treacle, and you have a bizarre out of body experience where you sit in on one of the meetings and wonder how it has taken three hours for them to agree that a decision should be made about something (but not actually make a decision).<p>If you've not read skunkworks, I'd highly recommend it. A lot of it details how one of Kelly Johnson's key strengths was being rather brutal to his 'customers' (DoD usually) to prevent their incompetence, expense and geological timescales leaking into his outfit.

3723529,comment,3723355,3723355,24,0,jgrahamc,,,"Goes deeper than just IBM.  Prior to DOS there was CP/M and CP/M had many programs with an older heritage.  For example, it was possible to copy from a source (such as a file) to a destination (such as another file, or an I/O port) using a program called PIP (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_Interchange_Program</a>).  On CP/M, for example, you could print a file with the command (PRN: is the name of the printer device; at the time that was likely a parallel connected printer):<p><pre><code>    PIP PRN:=FOO.TXT
</code></pre>
PIP itself predates CP/M having been present on machines such as the PDP-11.  Wikipedia tells me that it was first implemented on the PDP-6.  For example, on the PDP-10 you could do:<p><pre><code>    PIP DTA1:/X=DSK:*.*
</code></pre>
which copied all the files from the disk onto tape.  The /X there modifies the destination and indicates that file attributes (modification time etc.) should be preserved.<p>PS Now my memory is fully restored from 1980s backing store I believe that CP/M actually replaced the / in PIP with single character switches inside [] and that the route to / being switches in MS-DOS most likely comes through DEC heritage from the PDP series.  For example, the W switches would ignore r/o set on a file and overwrite it.  This would copy all .COM files (i.e. executables) from B: to A: and overwrite without warning:<p><pre><code>    PIP A:=B:*.COM[W]</code></pre>",1332159278

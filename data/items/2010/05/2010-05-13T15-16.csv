This institute started to encode it in machine readable form from 1993 and completed the first draft in 2000. In the process they discovered 23,385 new letterforms not registered anywhere.

They've sold a lot of handsets as a result.  If it weren't for these decisions, then the sales wouldn't have happened and Adobe wouldn't be trying to strongarm their way onto the platform.<p>In short, decisions such as not supporting Flash are in fact part of the OS's appeal and this entire debate is bizarre.<p>Furthermore, Adobe's entire argument that developers and consumers should shun Apple's lock-in for Adobe's lock-in is absolutely absurd!<p>edit: In thinking about it, the danger of an Adobe (or any other vendor) monopoly on the write once, run anywhere application market is huge.  It's several orders of magnitude greater in significance than that of Apple controlling the development environment for its own devices.<p>Apple will have a large market share in internet-connected devices for quite some time, but it probably won't ever command a majority of marketshare in any given segment (it will command an abnormally huge amount of revenue share though, the way it does with PCs and now phones).  If you don't like what Apple offers you as a developer, there are plenty of other targets.    If Adobe gets its way and controls the runtime everywhere, and even assuming it works and is fast everywhere (it won't be), then all developers are probably screwed.<p>Lastly, it's disappointing that Google in recent times has reneged on its relative commitment to HTML5 given its Android and Chrome development decisions to bundle flash into both platforms.  This is a much more significant development, with much greater consequences, than changes to the iPhone dev agreement because Android and Chrome, in various forms, are likely to be run on the plurality of devices going forward.  We need HTML5 to succeed flash, but this won't happen until the infrastucture is built: implementations need to get faster, dev tools need to be built, et cetera and Google's decisions have likely impeded this process by removing some of the incentive for these things to happen.",1273766135

Depending on what you knew at the time, it may have been by far the rational thing to help jews. Because then when it's over, you could claim you were one of the few who helped, and wouldn't be as guilty as all the rest.<p>> People who have faith have one absolute advantage over those who do not - their path is always clear. They know what they are doing, they know why they are doing it, and even when they doubt, they can always fall back in blind trust in some invisible thing.<p>I fail to see how this is an advantage. Suppose you had a well-defined, crystal-clear path walking off a cliff. That's good just because it's clear? Also I'm not convinced that faithful actually have clear paths; they're just as confused as the rest of us, but they don't like to think about that.<p>> And they are happier, because as each step along their route unfolds and turns out to be right, their faith increases and their belief that the problems will always be overcome with more faith grows.<p>And this is where I suspect this author is simply a troll. Is it really the case that the faithful are happier than other people? This contradicts my experience. I think the faithful are probably no more or less happy than anyone else. Indeed, frequently faith is a source of unhappiness, like any time they are faced with something that contradicts their faith.<p>This statements also claims ""as each step along their route unfolds and turns out to be right"", but actually they are right less often than rational people! And the author has ignored all the times when they turn out to be wrong. Being wrong more often than rational people isn't a bad thing?<p>> Don't dismiss blind belief in something. It's an extra-ordinary tool. It's fundamentally human, and when you rationalize it away, you are are taking away one of those quirks that make us human - those strange things like love and laughter and revenge that should not be there, but are, and separate us from machines.<p>Personally, I see faith as a meme, and we are seeing its tricks in action here.

Negotiations along such lines rapidly enter into a surreal mode that leaves entrepreneurs scratching their heads and wondering, ""why can't we just cut through this garbage and get to the heart of the deal?""<p>This sort of fixation normally adds significant costs to any business deal (""we'll need to thoroughly research all these possibilities""; ""we'll need a 3-page indemnity clause instead of the 1-paragraph version""), tends to paralyze deal momentum and cause the parties to shift their focus onto side issues in their deal (""this deal can't possibly move forward until we can absolutely eliminate these risks""), and winds up causing parties to negotiate 50-page contracts where a 10-pager might have done the same thing without necessarily addressing every remote contingency that might occur in hypothetical scenarios where things can go wrong.<p>A good business lawyer should be neither a deal killer nor a CYA type but should be sharp in identifying risks and have good judgment in weighing them against benefits so as to strike a practical balance that moves deals forward while keeping them honest, with the client making the final decisions based on such guidance. Of course, some deals <i>are</i> incredibly complex, or have very large amounts at stake, and this does warrant more fastidiousness about risk issues.

It can help with learning a new platform (I think the main goal) when coming from a platform that you already know, so you are concentrating on studying the platform and the solutions when you already understand the problem.<p>Sort of a Rosetta's stone for web applications.<p>The idea itself is not original, in the middle ages of computing a guy called Lance Leventhal had a series of assembly language books that would re-implement the same programs on different platforms and it helped a lot when switching from one architecture to another to have both implementations in front of you.<p>Because we are all very familiar with the HN website I'd propose that we would spec HN down to the last bolt with respect to how it works as experienced by the user, and then use that to build the various implementations off.<p>Some languages may have more than one implementation (for instance, because there are multiple frameworks or because someone rolled their own or did not use a framework at all), but that only adds to the general body of knowledge of how things are 'done' in a certain environment.<p>Is this a viable idea?<p>Any takers?",1273763919

However, instead of water coming from a tap, users access computing power from a pool of shared resources. Just like the tap in your kitchen, cloud computing services can be turned on or off as needed, and, when the tap isn’t on, not only can the water be used by someone else, but you aren’t paying for resources that you don’t use.

A clean pulled tree is over 1GB at the moment I believe, and contains many binary files (static libraries etc.) that aren't rebuilt that often, but often enough to make the repository as a whole very large. I don't know exactly how large it is, but it's large enough that it would take many weeks to download over VPN. Just getting a fresh tree takes over 24 hours as it is.<p>As for diff packing, it's as simple as this on the bash command line:<p><pre><code>    collect-patch $(now)-hint.patch foo/{bar,baz}
</code></pre>
The collect-patch script will do an svn diff over foo/bar and foo/baz from the root of my working directory, and deposit the results in a file in my current directory (e.g. 2010-05-13_15-50-whatever.patch).<p>Then, I can revert local changes:<p><pre><code>    revert 2010-05-13_15-50-whatever.patch
</code></pre>
(This reverts changes to the files listed as modified in the patch.) Because it's a file, I get completion on that. And to apply (e.g. after an svn update):<p><pre><code>    apply 2010-05-13_15-50-whatever.patch
</code></pre>
If things get more complicated, and there are conflicts in the lines modified by my patch and the updated source (which is less than 1% of the time), then I do:<p><pre><code>    manual-merge 2010-05-13_15-50-whatever.patch
</code></pre>
That uses a tool (BeyondCompare 3) to do three-way merging between the original revision of my patch, my local edit to the original revision, and the new revision that's been gotten locally. BC3 can auto-merge for all non-conflicting edit sections, but be interactive with a nice diff display and editing if there's a conflict (/automerge and /reviewconflicts arguments to bcomp).<p>I'm sure I could migrate this scheme onto an analogous git scheme that could keep track of the merges better, but in practice this scheme is enough - and because I wrote it, I'm intimately familiar with its mechanics, so I can extend it, and I'm not at risk of file loss, etc.",1273762885

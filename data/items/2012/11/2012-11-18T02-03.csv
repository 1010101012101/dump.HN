This path leads to obvious, uninteresting, facile, lazy, short-term, me-too, style-over-substance, meaningless creations that I can barely label as such.<p>Of course- but one must give them time! They're barely starting to figure out how to interact with their peers and themselves, and you want them to create masterpieces on the side? ""On n'est pas srieux quand on a 17 ans!"" (""We are not serious when we are 17"" - Rimbaud had it right)<p>Everything in its moment; the important thing is that their creations should not be dismissed as ""obvious, uninteresting, lazy [...]"", because negativity is the mother of sterility.<p>> But I believe there needs to be a level of inner dialogue and disregard for what's popular around oneself, that is a) at odds with the desire for teens to 'fit', b) rarely encouraged in practice in our society, and c) hard to sustain against the amount of noise (media, fashion, etc) we surround ourselves with.<p>Some of them can figure that out on their own; some don't (and most are in between).

4799680,comment,4799479,4799634,15,0,leif,,,"Hi, I'm one of the authors (I'm an engineer, not an author of the original papers, though I can discuss those too)! What would you like to know?<p>First, the structure you described is called a cache oblivious lookahead array (COLA), and is not what we implement. It betrays a lot of the concepts that make up a fractal tree and is a good educational tool, which is why you'll find lots of Tokutek material that describes it, but there are some key places where it departs from what we actually ship. Conceptually (and asymptotically) they're similar, but when you get down to the details of an industrial-strength implementation (like variable-sized keys, as you mention, concurrency is another frequent question we get), you have to be more specific about what we build.<p>So. What we build is closer to a cache-oblivious streaming b-tree, but I won't make you look that up. Basically, we take a b-tree and stick an unsorted buffer on each internal node. To insert data into a subtree rooted at node X, you just append your data to X's buffer. Then, if the buffer's too full, you flush X's buffer, distributing all its elements among X's children (but that just puts them in the buffers of the children). You can flush recursively, and make leaf nodes just hold data instead of buffers. This gives the same insertion asymptotics as the COLA did.<p>Now you need to pick a node size, a strategy for querying, ideas for concurrency, recovery, etc. but this is a start. I'll start by saying that since we write nodes less frequently, we can pick a much larger node size, which helps eliminate fragmentation and gives us a chance to get much more aggressive compression (since large blocks compress better than small ones).<p>Hopefully this gives some insight into how we handle variable sized elements. The mongo benchmark (as with all our mysql benchmarks) is running on something that supports variable sized elements (though I don't remember if the benchmark itself takes advantage of that).<p>This is still pretty unspecified, and we can keep talking about fractal trees, but does what I've said so far make sense? Do you have any new questions?",1353207359

4799639,comment,4798381,4799534,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"That is a credible argument. I wonder if they get trapped in the 'zero trillion dollar market' paradox. Tom Lyon introduced that one to me, basically it went like this, the market for one telephone is 0, the market for telephone services for everyone is a trillion dollars, but you can't get to the trillion dollars without first having a telephone for everyone. So its the tech equivalent of the chicken and the egg. What paralyzes people in those spaces is that they ""see"" the trillion dollar market, and they don't want anyone else to get their first, so any progress toward it from 'not them' is shut down. Sadly if they are in that mindset they are already dead, they just don't know it.<p>Another anecdote. I was trying to create a viable replacement for the newspaper briefly. E-readers were new, but had gotten past 'fringe.' There were some vendors who had good hardware but not great software, one of the vendors was Plastic Logic which had exclusive control over a process for making flexible e-ink screens that were very durable. At the time, (and to some extent today), that the screen needed a glass substrate meant large format e-readers weren't feasible. My iRex Illiad V2 had the largest screen at the time and folks complained bitterly when a coffee cup or some other modest 'event' cracked the screen. I decided that to blow the lid off this we needed to marry a big flexible screen with a core of open source software and a new UI so I talked with the guy at PL who helped the CEO define the overall company strategy (well that is what he said, hard to know etc etc). The key founders at PL were the scientists who had 'invented' this technology. They <i>knew</i> how huge it could be and dammit all that money was going to flow right into their pockets! E-readers were a zero trillion dollar market and they had showed a reader which had some really nice properties for shipping 'later that year'. The only problem was that nobody knew what a 'real' UI was for these things, nobody knew what the best price points were, they were only B&W and tablets were threatening (iPad hadn't been released yet) and I said ""You can't possibly hope to out invest everyone else in making these things successful, especially Amazon who has a built in way to make money off these things in perpetuity. If you stay on this road you are already dead.""<p>Obviously not what the guy was expecting to hear, after all they could do something nobody else could! Except that geeks and freaks like me were buying e-readers for exorbitant prices because we did that kind of thing but the <i>real</i> market was much lower in price, and a company trying to capitalize the creation of an entirely new fabrication process was going to amortize all those costs over their ability to deliver what was essentially a consumer electronic device? You can bet all your money on one number at the roulette wheel but its not a good business strategy.<p>Needless to say things played out exactly as I said they would, PL was always just about to release or finalize their specs when the next thing dropped and added new checklist items they needed to go back and implement, early results with the UI were poor and the price floor fell out with Amazon pushing things out at cost. Their reader that they thought they would get $1,000 for was going to under perform a $400 reader with a built in pipeline of content.<p>Compare that to making displays and selling them. Sure its the 'parts' business and your margins are a lot lower but you can start amortizing the cost of your manufacturing right away. And as things start falling out in the e-reader market you find niches that are under served and get folks to attack those markets with your parts. You watch you learn you profit on all the investment everyone else is doing. And then you step in with your own awesome solution.<p>It would do Twitter good to embrace the utility model, then while that was keeping the lights on, figure out what this thing was really doing, <i>why</i> did people value it, what did it do that couldn't be done elsewhere, and <i>then</i> move up the value chain. But if they remain afraid that ""someone else"" will get there like they have, they open the door for alternatives which will kill them anyway. Just like Plastic Logic who you never hear about any more and nobody had any big payday. Emerging markets are great, but they are fragile, and missteps are more costly. I hope they figure it out.",1353205732

Well, I agree as much as I can, because I haven't written a book, but I have written a few web apps (and have started a company). Let's say for the sake of discussion they're reasonably similar, even if perhaps they aren't.<p>Yes, creating technology is a lot easier than it used to be. Marketing is probably easier as well. But I don't believe whatsoever that building a web app is the same as building a billion dollar business. There are a few examples of business which got lucky, fine, but having started a startup myself, I can say (in line with many others, pg included) that running a company is so much different -- and so much more difficult -- than just hacking up a web app.<p>Steering a company to massive success requires so many difficult decisions and skills that often have nothing to do with your core competencies (unless you're one of those mythical creatures who can 'do it all'), that you need the support of at least one other person who is either A) better at it than you are, or B) can work together with you to figure out how.

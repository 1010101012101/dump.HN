6428,comment,6402,6402,0,0,vlad,,,"From my experience, I want to add that customer satisfaction increases as the price you charge increases.<p>You may think you've ""launched"" a product by removing the word ""beta"" and finding a lot of publicity.  However, if a customer sees you are charging only $5 a month for something incredibly disruptive which saves your users thousands of dollars per year, they will consider you still in beta, and will not take you seriously.<p>Customers will feel much more at ease when you charge them a lot of money, which shows confidence you know what you're doing and that you want to be around the next day.  I would imagine this will also increase the value of the company during a take over.",1174937817

These tricks aren't ""ruthless"" at all.  Often, it is necessary to use unconventional means to get the ball rolling.

Building software requires more than just syntatic sugar.<p>C# has all these features yet I have never seen killer tools that changed the .net landscape like Rails did with Ruby. While I would not call those language features smoke and mirror, I argue that they are merely nice to have and not ground nor thought provoking.<p>At the end of the day, Java ecosystem still move forward way faster than .net. Spring, cloudera, datastax, alfresco, liferay, ehcache, jboss, tomcat, Embedded server like Jetty,  and other great, free, mature, serious, and open source tools are available at our disposal vs taking to sales rep to buy licenses, which are a common activity in .net world.",1359640784
5144961,comment,5143839,5143839,9,0,michaelochurch,,,"Depression is partly biological-- the tendency that way surely is-- but it's also a natural outgrowth of a society that doesn't forgive mistakes and that tests people not based on peak capability or creativity, but on breaking point.<p>Somehow, we've conflated character and loyalty (which <i>are</i> important) with the willingness to suffer needlessly in the name of subordination and whatever the fuck ""team player"" means.<p>The brogrammer culture and unnecessary long hours of Corporate America are all about testing people based on their decline curves, not peak performance. It's competing to suffer rather than competing to excel. Who is the first to crack? Fire him. Who is the last to break? Promote him. It's ridiculous and of course it's going to lead to an ""epidemic"" of mental illness.<p>In the corporate world, we promote based on participation in shared suffering (i.e. who stays until 1:30am to meet an arbitrary deadline) rather than talent, and we kick people when they're down, which is why it's impossible for someone to get back into the career game after even a short time outside of it (maternity, illness, depression). Of course we're going to have our best people dropping like flies.<p>Depression and anxiety disorders have always existed, but they don't need to be this common. I wouldn't be surprised to learn that at least half of the problem is caused by social and economic forces. These problems are biological at root, but social factors tend to modulate the severity that people experience.<p>Mark Suster deserves major props for speaking out about this.

While market cap has no relation whatsoever to the profitability of a company, it does allow Amazon to keep investing in expanding into all the directions they are expanding in. At current valuations, they only have to add ~5M shares (on a current total of ~450M outstanding) to raise around ~$1B. This is not a free ride though, they _will_ have to be able to jack up their profits somewhere in the future, otherwise the stock will sink and they will have a hard time to keep up their strategy of expansion.<p>I'm quite surprised they have been able to keep up this game for so long myself, but it's not totally crazy. Online shopping is has been growing like crazy for since Amazon started, the market today is probably at least a 100 times larger than ~10 years ago. Some day though, growth will start to level off, and looking at Amazon's earnings releases over the last 2 years or so, it seems like we're almost there.

I also agree that we need more sympathy and help for those who suffer it, and there needs to be less stigma surrounding it.<p>Having said that, we should not forget the victim's loved ones left behind, after his/her suicide to grieve and bury the victim. These people are victims too. Sometimes other lives are destroyed by an act of suicide. A young wife left to raise the kids alone. A mother forced to bury an only child; perhaps committed to a life of depression herself.<p>For the record, I have had my own battles with depression. I have had days I was unable to get out of bed. I have also had suicidal thoughts. But the thought of the pain I would inflict on my family, particularly my mom, would never allow me to truly consider it an option. I don't pretend to have felt the pain that would drive one to suicide, because there are degrees and experiences differ. But it helps to know where I'm coming from.<p>I think there needs to be more of a stigma surrounding suicide and more awareness for the pain of those that are left to grieve.

What is impossible is stringing your fiber on the utility rights of way.<p>In most places in the US the telephone poles and utility conduits are generally owned by the telephone or electric company. You need to lease pole space from them, and those leases aren't cheap. There have been several municipal WiFi initiatives that got alot of press, but later died because they couldn't afford to rent the pole access.<p>In higher-density areas, there are alternatives. For example, in Albany, NY a small telco provider worked with the city to provide municipal wifi and public safety networking using traffic lights, city buildings, and streetlights (which are owned by the city). The problem with that model is that you get good coverage in central business districts and avenues, but nothing on residential blocks.<p>You have duopolies because the Bell System was the one and only phone company, and the Feds have basically allowed SBC/AT&T and Verizon to bring that back. Phone companies didn't ""get"" IP networks in the 90's and early 2000's, and decided to just milk the aging out POTS network as long as possible and ask for government handouts later. Cable companies evolved differently from community co-ops (Ars Technica has a few good stories about this) and tend to operate in a model where they get a franchise agreement that gives them a monopoly in a city or town. So now you have highly regulated, dumb telcos and lesser regulated cable companies who negotiate sweetheart deals with dumb municipal governments.",1359640124

The thought can be qualified as ""negative"" or ""positive"" by the physical bodily sensation it produces. Negative thought essentially produces self-inflicted pain within the body. Consistent negative thinking produces more inner pain and at more intense levels. \nThis inner pain in turns fuels negative thoughts pattern that continues to inflict more ""emotional"" pain.\nThen it becomes vicious cycle of ""beating yourself up"".<p>At deeply depressed stages thought control no longer works and any attempts to ""think yourself"" out of depression are becoming futile. At these stages depression is fueled by constant intense physical/emotional pain that is constantly present seemingly without any thinking processed.\nThe more intense the pain - the more unbearable it is - and this drives person to suicide as the last resort to stop suffering.<p>The actual solution in this case it to guide person to look at the pain directly instead of escaping, avoiding or suppressing it with painkillers. Painkillers may be necessary to maintain sanity though through the practice.\nThis is ancient practice talked about by pretty much every spiritual teacher - yet widely ignored.\nWhen you feel depressed - locate exact area of painful physical sensations within the body and start observing it.\nWatch your sensations, watch your feelings, watch them exactly where they are. Do not try to change them, do not try to kill them, just observe them. At the same time breathe and follow your breathing as well.\nConscious breathing slows down incessant thinking. Direct observation of painful emotions will start dissolving them.<p>This is very efficient practice that I personally benefited from during very intense emotional downturns and depressive states.",1359639646

A dictionary and a grammar are works which describe a language. Such works record, and thereby fix, the elements of the language they describe: the meanings of its words and its syntax. It does not follow that the language is a work. Rather, the language is the material from which works (including dictionaries and grammars) may be created. The evolutionary or organic aspect of language can be left on one side for the moment, since it is clear that it is possible to create a language from scratch. Even when a language is created from scratch, however, what it amounts to is a system of rules for the generation and recognition of meaningful statements. Programming languages such as the SAS Language are no different in this respect.</i><p>Maybe someone could correct me here but my interpretation is that the judge does not <i>really</i> decide whether or not a) a programming language is capable of being a ""work"" and b) SAS Language is a work, since they are not relevant to the remainder of the case. Indeed, he merely gives the above as his ""provisional"" view which leaves the gate somewhat open and no precedent set by this specific case.",1359638713

At the start I was helped by seeing a psychologist (who practiced CBT) and by taking medication.

This had been a fear all my life, and still is. Situations come up quite frequently when I do this fearing total rejection, but I still do it. There's fear but no anxiety. I've come to realise that honesty is much more valuable, and perhaps the most valuable thing of all. Not only to me, but to others too.<p>Recently I got a tremendous boost and confirmation when I heard about some of the reasoning behind the development of something called Non-violent Communication, in which it is also touched upon depression.

Obama was \n  criticised for backing stability as the drama of Tahrir \n  Square unfolded. But on 1 February came his call for \n  Mubarak to step down ""now"". As the New York Times wrote: \n  ""Obama upended three decades of American relations with its \n  most stalwart ally in the Arab world, putting the weight of \n  the United States squarely on the side of the Arab street.""\n</code></pre>\nAs for this:<p><pre><code>  look back through history. Nation building by rebel proxy \n  does not work \n</code></pre>\nNation building doesn't work. Revolution by rebel proxy sure does. Governments don't overthrow themselves. As for history, the American Revolution succeeded because the French were pumping in money. The Vietnamese beat off the Americans because they had the Chinese and Soviets in their corner. The Afghans repelled the USSR with the help of the US and the Stinger missile. You will be hard pressed to find a revolution that won or even began without the intervention of foreign powers; where are the armaments coming from in the first place? The record shows that the Arab Spring was caused by US training, funding, armaments, and media support.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/15aid.html?pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/15aid.html?pagewante...</a><p><pre><code>  We learned how to organize and build coalitions, said \n  Bashem Fathy, a founder of the youth movement that \n  ultimately drove the Egyptian uprisings. Mr. Fathy, who \n  attended training with Freedom House, said, This certainly \n  helped during the revolution.\n\n  At one time the United States financed political reform \n  groups by channeling money through the Egyptian government. \n  But in 2005, under a Bush administration initiative, local \n  groups were given direct grants, much to the chagrin of \n  Egyptian officials.\n\n  The Egyptian government even appealed to groups like \n  Freedom House to stop working with local political \n  activists and human rights groups.\n\n  They were constantly saying: Why are you working with \n  those groups, they are nothing. All they have are slogans, \n   said Sherif Mansour, an Egyptian activist and a senior \n  program officer for the Middle East and North Africa at \n  Freedom House.\n\n  When their appeals to the United States government failed, \n  the Egyptian authorities reacted by restricting the \n  activities of the American nonprofit organizations.\n\n  In the face of government opposition, some groups moved \n  their training sessions to friendlier countries like Jordan \n  or Morocco. They also sent activists to the United States \n  for training.\n</code></pre>\nFurther documentation on this topic is not hard to find. But feel free to minimize the explicit, acknowledged support of the most powerful country in the world for violent democratic revolution in favor of local ""agency"". As for whether this article on the #2 leader in China was printed at random, The New York Times has a track record of coordinating with the US government:<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/world/asia/22pakistan.html?_r=2&pagewanted=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/world/asia/22pakistan.html...</a><p><pre><code>  The New York Times had agreed to temporarily withhold \n  information about Mr. Davis's ties to the agency at the \n  request of the Obama administration, which argued that \n  disclosure of his specific job would put his life at risk. \n  Several foreign news organizations have disclosed some \n  aspects of Mr. Davis's work with the C.I.A. On Monday,  \n  American officials lifted their request to withhold \n  publication, though George Little, a C.I.A. spokesman, \n  declined any further comment.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2011/02/21/nyt_16/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.salon.com/2011/02/21/nyt_16/</a><p><pre><code>  It's one thing for a newspaper to withhold information \n  because they believe its disclosure would endanger lives. \n  But here, the U.S. Government has spent weeks making public \n  statements that were misleading in the extreme -- Obama's \n  calling Davis ""our diplomat in Pakistan"" -- while the NYT \n  deliberately concealed facts undermining those government \n  claims because government officials told them to do so. \n  That's called being an active enabler of government \n  propaganda. ...\n\n  Following the dictates of the U.S. Government for what they \n  can and cannot publish is, of course, anything but new for \n  the New York Times. In his lengthy recent article on \n  WikiLeaks and Julian Assange, NYT Executive Editor Bill \n  Keller tried to show how independent his newspaper is by \n  boasting that they published their story of the Bush NSA \n  program even though he has ""vivid memories of sitting in \n  the Oval Office as President George W. Bush tried to \n  persuade [him] and the paper's publisher to withhold the \n  eavesdropping story""; Keller neglected to mention that the \n  paper learned about the illegal program in mid-2004, but \n  followed Bush's orders to conceal it from the public for \n  over a year -- until after Bush was safely re-elected.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, whether under Bush or Obama, the NYT has an acknowledged track record of coordinating with the US government on stories that could result in international incidents. A hit piece on one of the top people in the Chinese government might not have been done at the State Department's request, but it certainly would not have been published over the State Department's objection. The fact that its effect was to sow discontent with China's leadership is not unnoticed by anyone skeptical of US-exported democratic revolution.",1359637586

138492,comment,138412,138412,0,0,paulkafasis,,,"I think having the level meter in JUST the ""i"" would be far better. As others have noted, readability is very low on this as it is. Adjusting just one letter can work, but not three, especially two in a row.<p>As far as colors go, none of these are very vivid. Perhaps all white with just the ""i"" as a green level meter, with a white dot.",1205707947

138490,comment,138446,138446,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Might work as an iPhone or mobile app. Not as an app for standard browsers -- the data are too time-sensitive, and I don't have the coordination to juggle a laptop while driving a car.<p>What I'd really kill for is a version of this app that could alert me to on-street spaces, or other cheap alternatives. I don't usually have much trouble parking in downtown garages -- they cost so much that they often have spaces, and if they don't have spaces they generally have signs at the entrance to tell you. I once had the bright idea of planting a sort of super-RFID in the pavement under each on-street parking space -- or maybe in the parking meters? -- and monitoring those with an online service. Make that work and I'll be your friend for life.",1205707767

The book's claims are generally backed by empirical evidence, which is something missing in many other entrepreneurship books.<p>David Sickmiller",1205707665

The whole thing is a big logo train wreck.<p>Because the contrast of the stripey letters is so much lower, the whole thing ends up half-legible. At first glance I see ""p ay st"", or ""myp ay st"".

If Steve Jobs had composed the memo people would be <i>grateful</i> to have gotten it.<p>Given that the public version of the app store doesn't even <i>exist</i> yet, why should we be surprised that Apple is not yet willing to take your $99 for the right to sell something there?

138477,comment,138149,138344,0,0,llimllib,,,"Ooh, bad memories, my boss made the same argument at me last week.<p>Anyway! The relational model uses tables to model all data. Though you can squeeze a comment tree into a relational data mode any number of ways, it is most clearly expressed by a hierarchical model as in XML, S-exprs or a tree data type in your favorite language.<p>So I'm not saying it can't be expressed as relational data, what I mean is that that representation is not its most natural or useful form.<p>At work I use a query like:<p><pre><code>    select s1.id, s2.id, s3.id, s4.id ...\n    FROM subject s1\n    LEFT JOIN subject s2 WHERE s2.id=s1.parent\n    LEFT JOIN subject s3 WHERE s3.id=s2.parent\n    LEFT JOIN subject s4 WHERE s4.id=s3.parent\n    ....\n    WHERE s1.id=?\n</code></pre>\nto get all parents of a given node. It's ugly, inefficient, and fragile. You can use the nested set model to simplify this particular query, but inserting rows becomes extremely complex and painful; you really just trade one problem for another.<p>So, while you can model a tree as relational data, it's not a good match.",1205706831

I could charge exactly the same in C$ as I charged in 2002, and Americans will pay 50% more.

I'm not interested in pretending that the ability to solve puzzles is some sort of overall mark of quality, instead of just a specialized skill that is irrelevant as often as it's relevant. I've had more than enough of that attitude. I spent <i>years</i> in high school and college being exalted for my skill at constructing complex solutions to toy problems, as if SAT scores were the true measure of wisdom, or competence, or virtue.

138468,comment,138215,138449,0,0,breily,,,"The problem with using it for that is it doesn't seem to mark which 'entities' are more important than others.  So even though it seems to be able to mark proper nouns and numbers, it doesn't differentiate between an 'entity' being the subject of an article and just being mentioned.  There's probably ways to get around this(frequency counts of an entity in an article? number of google results for an entity?), but right now it doesn't seem to do that.",1205705608

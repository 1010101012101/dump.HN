I'm in a fortunate but also unfortunate position. I've got a freehold house (mortgage free) but I've got a ton of expenses from my family oh and an ill parent to look after. I've paid down the mortgage on this house completely and I pay for every single thing in this house and my own living expenses.<p>I've worked in two very very hot start-ups in v.sexy sectors. You've probably heard of both. Unfortunately, I just left college and the positions aren't exactly lucrative but the opportunities to learn are formidable. So for me 'life's ability' to try isn't available due to financial constraints.<p>I've two options either a) start my own thing or b) join someone else's start-up at the founder or first 2-3 senior hire positions.<p>At present I'd prefer to do my own thing and being in a full time job is needed. Real estate is an awful investment esp if it is your ONLY investment like it is for most people. I'd much prefer to be in a position i was in 4 years ago with a solid portfolio of liquid investments.<p>However, I realise a business is a brilliant investment, probably the best especially if its cash generative.<p>My long term goal actually is venture capital so either way I need solid operating experience to break in.<p>So, thats really whats holding me back but fortunately, I've got time on my side :)",1317243522

However, when starting out, configuring a server is just like configuring your localhost development environment. You just have to start with something that works, then gradually keep learning.<p>Heroku doesn't provide anything to me other than an unreasonable free quota that's basically useless for serving anything other than static content (poorly) ... even GitHub does a better job with their static pages option, since GitHub's servers don't go sleeping when unused.",1317243490

(After all, if they can save a half a cent per device and it still works just fine under Windows, that's just money in their pockets.)<p>We're working on it.  It's gotten better in the past year or two with the major OEMs and we're continuing to improve our relationships with them and the ODMs that build the hardware for them.  It's a process of education, driver improvement, and QA that goes on largely out of sight of anyone not actively involved in the process, but it is happening.  The good news is that this helps everyone, as the OEMs and ODMs are starting to think about this sort of issue throughout the design and production process rather than as just an afterthought.<p>Edit: Whoops, meant this to be a reply to joe_the_user",1317243019

If you see a program halt, after a millisecond or after 10 years, then you've obviously proven whether or not it halts.<p>Also, while the halting problem doesn't necessarily say anything about bugs, there is a more general theorem that essentially says that you can't know in general if a program enjoys any non-trivial property (e.g. it prints a ""1"" at some point, it accesses the network, or it halts). I can't recall the name of the theorem, but the intuitive proof is similar to the halting problem's.

That's mainly for a certain kind of game, though, more or less ""one that other indie developers will find interesting"". Some sort of innovative mechanic or new take on a genre is probably the most common route on that. If you do have that style of game, any other way of meeting other devs (forums, game jams, etc.) can also help spread the word; there are few things devs like more than talking about other cool games they recently heard about, and the more people who know about it, the more likely it is to get reviews / blogged about / etc.<p>That's another angle to go for directly, though; try to find some blogs covering areas where your game seems relevant, and see if they're interested in reviewing it.",1317242502

It'll get in your way less and let you just launch it sooner.<p>For anything larger than that though, Flask has always turned into a giant headache for me. As soon as I ever start to try and organize the project better because it's become too large for a single file, all shit hits the fan. Supposedly this has gotten slightly better with 0.7's Blueprints, but I've yet to see it. Circular imports and Flask's global variables bite me in the ass on a regular basis. I also have come to really miss tons of features that Django offered, like URLconfs. The decorator technique works great when you can count the number of URLs that your app has on two hands. Beyond that, ack/grepping my project to find where anything lives isn't my idea of maintainable. With Django I can very cleanly trace through the whole request/response cycle in my head and by looking at the code paths.",1317242495

Plus, it keeps me away from regular toys/distractions I might have at home or my desk at work.  I probably don't know anyone at the coffee shop, so it means odds are, no one will bother me in person.<p>(2) I'm the type of person that seems to focus better when there's stuff going on around me, but nothing is glaringly stealing my focus.  When I'm at home, I'll sometimes put on an action movie in the background and turn the sound down to a low level so its difficult to pick anything in particular out.

It should be apparent that getting a window to respond to an event is not the same thing as effecting that event.<p>Crucially, OOP languages without access modifiers (or ones you can #define away, like C++) have this same problem.

3049680,comment,3047554,3048848,2,0,seven_stones,,,"I would STRONGLY recommend AGAINST bouldering to start, because of the HIGH likelihood of injury from falling.<p>If you are not used to taking impacts from jumping from high places (e.g., typical sedentary person), you will almost certainly sustain a severe injury.<p>Broken and dislocated ankles and ligament ruptures are alarmingly common.  Dislocations are especially bad, because the ankle's blood supply isn't great to begin with, so a severe dislocation is like yanking a plug out of the wall; if the blood supply doesn't happen to get re-established (which even microsurgery can't do anything about), you are looking at avascular necrosis.  Imagine a dead coral reef crumbling away.<p>It's even worse in climbing shoes because your toes are crammed together -- imagine landing on your fist.<p>Rock-climbing (roped) gives your feet and ankles time to strengthen as you support your weight on tiny toe-holds, which is a slow process because ligaments and tendons have poor blood supplies compared to muscles.<p>Looking at elite climbers bouldering is like looking at elite gymnasts -- you don't see all the ones who got seriously injured along the way.  You see them taking 20-foot highball drops and think, how bad can 10 feet be?  Or 5 feet?<p>Even a drop of a few feet can result in a severe injury if your foot isn't flat; when you are jumping off backward onto a lumpy bouldering pad, if your foot lands inverted slightly, the impact can force it inward 90 degrees.<p>This probably happens twice a week at popular climbing gyms with bouldering areas.",1317240997

It is clunky, but at least you can do it. On the Nook you can only change font sizes, and that reflows the PDF and messes everything up.<p>The solution, as I see it, since they have a touch screen is to implement something similar to ezPDF, which is my favourite PDF reader for Android. Just a double tap on a section, and it'll zoom exactly on the section of text you want to read. You don't have to fiddle with fixed zoom settings and clunky movement to try and fit the viewport to include the portion you want to see.<p>Of course, they probably aren't interested in doing this at all, since they'd be very happy if you only read books bought at their store.<p>PS.

Screw a startup. Just start an open source project. Changes the world, makes people's lives better, creates an organization of lasting value, isn't a startup.<p>Why do all these commenters seem to think you need a for profit company in order to make things? The Internet is nothing but billions of things that have been made for free in people's spare time. I want nothing more than infinite spare time to make whatever I please as I please as I relax in a tropical paradise with the people I care about. Startups are the opposite of that.",1317240147

There were really big speed ups both computing wise - but (especially in those days) also transport.<p>I don't know how Amazon is doing it with Silk, but I'm guessing they're seeing enough of a speed up to make it worthwhile.",1317240135
3049614,comment,3049400,3049400,2,0,AndrewGCook,,,"As a fellow founder, I experience the ups-and-downs of the start-up roller coaster everyday. One of my favorite quotes from Founders at Work comes from Joe Kraus, one of the creators of Excite:<p>The hardest part in a startup is that you wake up one morning and you feel great about the day, and you think, Were kicking ass. And then you wake up the next morning and you think Were dead. And literally nothings changed. You havent made some big deal, you havent sold something new. Maybe you wrote a few lines of code over the course of that last day. Maybe you had some conversations with people, but nothings really moved. Its completely irrational, but its exactly what you go through.<p>It's easy to let yourself get down in the dumps by what other people say. One bad though of defeatism can ruin you entire day. It's also easy to combat it in a few small ways:<p>- Commit code everyday - If you do this, you'll see your small gains adding up, have a record of what you've learned, and everyday feel like you've made at least some progress. Even if it's a small change (changing a color on a button you've been looking at for weeks), nothing makes you feel better than commit and deploying code.<p>- Find a great cofounder - If you're serious about starting a new start-up (or just learning more in general), find someone to go into battle with you. You'll feel off each other's energy in a ying-yang sort of way. When you're bummed, their natural tendency will be to protect you and pump you up. When s/he is bummed, you'll do the same.<p>Find a rock - Not many people talk about rock's as a necessary part of starting a company. To me, a rock is someone who you trust greatly, is a good listener, and is removed from the business. It can be boy/girlfriend, husband/wife, friend, mentor, practically anyone. The key to a good rock is they are objective, a good listener, and won't even judge you.<p>Just start - There's nothing like finding out whether you should go on the journey than to take a few steps and see how you feel.<p>If jumping back on the start-up roller coaster is what you want, then enjoy the ride.",1317240083

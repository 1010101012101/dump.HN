The accent over cache would be only slightly pretentious if you didn't have it pointing the wrong way (cach√© is the slightly archaic spelling you're struggling to remember). But the fact that the word you're looking for is ""cachet"" makes it a double fail.",1238755885

Neither Linux nor OSX were significant factors in the downfall of SGI.",1238755780

Tastes vary! Much as I love my visits to the USA I think US food is far too sweet so I would probably avoid the guidance of west Coast hackers. I also know that food styles vary - I live in France and here food tends to be simply prepared (well in the countryside anyway) and dishes concentrate on a simple combination of flavours - perhaps with more dishes served in succession during a meal than would be normal elsewhere. Thus a recipe suitable for my neighbours might fail if presented to some visitors from the UK.<p>So - back to my original response I think...",1238754616
544732,comment,544355,544406,0,0,wheels,,,"Sun and SGI lost out long before that.  It's not like people just stopped buying Sun workstations a couple years ago; they were already out of style a decade ago.  While I was in college, in the late 90s, I saw all of the workstations that were Sun's when I came in be replaced by PCs running Linux.  This was before OS X 1.0 even was available, and it was a few more years even before Mac users started warming to OS X.<p>Sun might have been doing some interesting things, but they've pretty much had a decade of investing into technologies they don't have a way to monetize, both in software and hardware.  I'm just glad that it's IBM buying them since I think of the potential acquirers, that IBM would be the closest fit to keep some of their character intact.",1238754590

544727,comment,544284,544643,0,0,mnemonicsloth,,,"It's silly to rely on anecdotes like this.  For example, the AK-47 is as old today as the sailing ships you mention at the time of the first aircraft carriers, but some American combat units are willing to ditch their M4s for it.  The odds it will be improved much in the near future are pretty slim.<p>I think the flaw in your argument is the word ""obsolete"" -- it connotes ""replaced"" or ""no longer in use.""  What else, besides the carrier battle group, do you use to project power?",1238754143

So many cool people own multiple Palms and have pledged to buy every new Palm that comes out... plus those rocker ads are really snazzy, brilliant on Palm's part, their name is practically synonymous with ""cool.""<p>Or not.<p>I wish people would pause, think, and learn from the fact that every ""X Killer"" fails to kill X, at least where X is a well-branded, well-positioned product with a history and a devoted customer base.<p>Palm, as a company, is just one big fat mistake after another.",1238753481

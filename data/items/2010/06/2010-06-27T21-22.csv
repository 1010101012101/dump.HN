1466331,comment,1465454,1465833,0,0,peterzakin,,,"the first two angles make sense. Facebook is what facebook is because of the culture around it. Culture changes with the emergence of new technologies/features. So i would think that the most probable scenario for a facebook death involves new companies that make better use of emerging technologies, e.g. geolocation. And i happen to believe that if facebook drops the ball on geolocation, and geolocation services see a major increase in popularity, we may see the birth of a competitive social graph. That is a real possibility.<p>As for your third angle, I think there is room for a niche-facebook that could be crazy profitable--but i don't see a niche social network taking over the social graph. that seems relatively far-fetched.",1277675960

Adding support for all the typographic features in modern fonts (small caps, uncommon ligatures, lower-case numbers, etc.) would be a nice plus, but wouldn't really be essential.<p>Unfortunately, as it is, the book printers of the 16th century were able to make more readable text layouts than can be easily done with HTML/CSS today.

You can never be sure if your wins or losses are real or just mirages caused by noise.  Humans need the emotional encouragement that incremental success brings.  Nothing get's me excited to work more than a good day of sales or a thoughtful comment from a customer.  It takes a special type of personality to keep on persisting in the face of repeated failure.  Certain start-ups also have winner-take-all properties.  Anything that relies on network externalities or advertising revenue is more risky.  The rewards can be big, but I prefer markets where the product's value isn't a function of the customer base and success is more incremental.",1277675707

In fact, for the purposes of predictive power, it will probably be worse.<p>I'm not extremely well educated on the subject, so somebody correct me, but these predictive models have always struck me as just complicated splines. Add a thousand data points, and the ""predictions"" for old datapoints look really good. The problem isn't with the math,  it's with an inappropriate application of the math based either on fundamental misunderstanding of extrapolation or on a fundamental failing of human psychology in not realizing that the model was built on the data, and not the other way around.",1277673773

1466229,comment,1465454,1466153,0,0,codingthewheel,,,"Well actually I agree. Well-stated. Open <i>may</i> form part of the ultimate successor to FB. It's 100% true the average Facebook user doesn't know, and doesn't care, about ""open"". But what being open wins you is support of the community, and in particular, ""developers, developers, developers"".<p>Take the (by no means parallel, but similar) case of iPhone vs. Android. The typical user could care less about whether iPhone is ""open"" or not, provided their apps work and their calls don't drop (heh). Still, Android makes a compelling case to developers and to handset manufacturers. Android gets huge points for being ""open"", and over time, I think that creates a head-leads, body-follows scenario where early adopters, tech evangelists, and people who surf sites like HN move to the new platform (whatever it is) en masse. Some time later, ""normal"" users then gravitate to that platform because the thought leaders have gone there, that's where the hype is, etc.<p>To put it another way: being open doesn't necessarily win you normal, everyday users. But it can win you the power users, the early adopters, and the thought leaders; and where they go, ""normal"" users tend to follow in time.<p>As for the ""how do users host their own node"" issue, I agree. This will never happen if people have to (my God, the horror) sign up for a web hosting account to have a Facebook page. But in an Internet where ""websites"" are torn off from the cloud at will, and where creating a ""website"" or ""web identity"" is as easy as pressing a button -- easier, in fact, than it is to create a Facebook page currently -- I think that's when you'll start to see user-controlled nodes become a real possibility for the mass market.

And you can count on being connected to almost everyone you know through Facebook just by signing in (over 1/4 of everyone on the internet is on Facebook, and I imagine this fraction is much higher in The US and other English-speaking countries).  How would one overcome this barrier?<p>Another problem is that Facebook is responsive to market pressures.  Despite the recent ""Exodus"" of privacy-aware folks being little more than a trickle, they made changes to the way their privacy works.  They adapt, and any significant improvement offered by a competitor will be added to Facebook's arsenal (Tagging in statuses, for example).<p>Finally, knowing all of this, it is much easier to simply include Facebook Connect in a social service than to leave it out.

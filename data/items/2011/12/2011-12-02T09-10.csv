But if these smart rich people can threaten to do something (run themselves, say they will do all donations to maximum permitted by law to other candidate, support some aide of them, etc) that will cost the election for the current candidate that is supporting SOPA, they may think twice about being shells for some industries.<p>What I am advocating is actually fighting fire with fire. You have politicians that get elected mostly by the donations made to them by these companies. So, why not get other companies that matter (Google, Mozilla, MS and Apple (not sure they stance on this) FSF, etc) together and start pushing the agenda as well?<p>Again, I don't know enough about the US system to even think what I'm saying is possible.",1322819956

What you effectively have to do is to social proof yourself, ie make it seem to others that it is okay for you to be aggressive.  What this means is not trying to appease the people that don't like you or even talking to them, until you have them over on your side you basically ignore them or keep your words to them at a minimum.<p>People in social situations tend to doubt their own judgement.

It isn't hard to imagine a society in which your daughter is your property and you can marry her to whomever you want, selling her to the highest bidder. Such societies still exist in 2011. It wouldn't be hard to imagine that if the ration of women to men would get balanced, then some women are going to become independent and get married for free, slowly destroying a perfectly valid business model ... so what should people do in such a case? Push for legislation to fix it?<p>So if your society gives rights that go against human nature, then your society is broken, really ;-)<p>The real question is - how can we reward authors in a world where distributing digital works has zero cost?\nI can think of many options, including introducing an optional monthly tax for anything you may download without a license to do so, which would at least work for another 5-10 years. Otherwise technology has been invalidating business models since forever, so maybe it's time to grow-up, quit the winning and think of other ways to make money - like doing good old fashioned concerts that can't be cloned or pirated - Michael Jackson understood this simple fact and made a lot of money off concerts, however I could see this not working so well in the long run for the likes of Bieber and Britney Spears.",1322819714
3303393,comment,3302393,3303191,4,0,yardie,,,"<i>if people had the choice to get a windows PC for $50 in exchange for some preinstalled apps and no admin access, you'd better believe they would.</i><p>They did try and it didn't work. Why? because PCs are abundant and the companies that wanted to do subsidized PCs couldn't get the economics to work. The smart ones realized that PCs were getting cheaper anyway so just wait a little bit. Others realized they could put it on credit and still come out ahead. Only the ones really bad with money/poor credit went the subsidized route (pay us now, and then pay us $40/mo indefinitely).<p>Phones are slightly different. The service doesn't get much cheaper whether you buy up front or subsidized. And unlike PCs, the price of phones hasn't dropped, the features just got better. And do to wireless restrictions of competition the price of plans hasn't dropped either.<p>For example, I just renewed my plan. I could pay $600 and buy my own phone. The carrier was going to knock $10/mo off my calling plan. Either way I was going to be locked in for the next 2 years. So I could shell out $600 and save $240 or I could only spend $100. I looked at the PAYG plans but due to my volume of calls it would cost more than the calling plan.<p>People aren't as naive as you think. They know they are going into this deal at a severe disadvantage so they might as well make the most of it.",1322819689

In the meanwhile, Haskell has gained (besides Happstack) two excellent web frameworks: Snap and Yesod.<p>One of the points of critique has been addressed now is database access. For instance, Persistent provides type-safe database access:<p><a href=""http://www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yesodweb.com/book/persistent</a><p>The author also mentions the problem that exceptions can only be caught in the IO monad. But this has become less of a problem, since more people started using monad transformers (such as ErrorT) to add error handling to their monads. ErrorT allows you to catch exceptions within that monad. For instance, quoting from one of my own projects:<p><pre><code>    readEntry :: MonadIO m => Corpus -> String -> ErrorT CorpusError m Text\n</code></pre>\n<i>readEntry</i> is a function that takes a <i>Corpus</i> and a <i>String</i>, and returns <i>Text</i> in a monad of the class <i>MonadIO</i> if the function is successful. Otherwise it reports errors in the form of a <i>CorpusError</i>. You could now, for instance, run this function with <i>runErrorT</i>, and it will return an ordinary <i>Either</i> value in the given monad (<i>Left CorpusError</i> in the case of an error, <i>Right Text</i> when the call is successful).",1322819587

Without legal tender laws, the ""good money"" wouldn't be driven out by the ""bad money"" (i.e. US currency).<p>Also, the reason the US government went completely off the gold standard in 71 was to increase deficit spending without having to pay our debts in gold or something of real value.  The Fed has a policy of steady inflation, only through debt liquidation can we ever expect to pay off the huge amounts we owe.  That is, we borrow 10 trillion and inflate 50% over a certain time, now we only owe 5 trillion.<p>End the legal tender laws, allow alternative commodity-based currencies and end the central planning of interest rates.

Creating better options requires different solutions for each country, so it is very expensive. With a harmonized system, you would be able to create a solution for 500 million potential users - it would be worth the effort.<p>Unfriendly legislation: The EU parliament can force national legislations to become friendlier, and especially to make it easier for a startup to operate in the whole EU.<p>Tax legislation: I'm not thinking about revenues taxation, but registration fees and mechanism and controls and the likes.

Everytime I sign one I try to make sure it's reasonable. That means that you should agree not to compete in the same space you're working on. Everything broader than that you should try to negotiate.<p>So for any non-compete that reads ""anything you do on your free time belongs to the company"" you should try your best not to sign it. Negotiate! It makes sense. If you work for facebook and you're building an alternative social network on your spare time, it's reasonable for facebook to claim ownership (because you're likely using inside information). If you're developing a new music distribution software, then you should be ok.<p>The commitment discussion is secondary. Either you perform according to expectations or you don't. If you don't, the company can fire you. Non-competes are not tools to measure your performance. That's my understanding and the argument I'd use to negotiate non-competes. Non-competes regulate IP.

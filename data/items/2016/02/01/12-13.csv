I started doing web development in 1996 (15 yo) and around 2012, I was extremely frustrated.  There were too many frameworks, databases, and tools which just made tradeoffs of solving one problem for creating another.  It seemed like web products weren&#x27;t getting better and the brittleness of development was increasing.  I started mobile development in 2008 when the first iPhone SDK came out and fully switched over as a career in 2012 and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.",1454331583

It&#x27;s refreshing (as the parent says) to see someone who knows tech, but can also explain it to the general population. I think it increases enthusiasm and reduces stereotyping.<p>One thing that I am missing in mass media, though, is more of the critical/political aspects of hacker culture. E.g., it would be great if the worries of the tech community in the privacy/security balance debate could be represented from the tech community&#x27;s side. It seems that Glen Greenwald is one of the very few visible journalists to do so.<p>Of course, such topics are not as &#x27;sexy&#x27; as the new iPhone ;).",1454331545

Only those who are unfit for their positions,\n  stupid, or incompetent don&#x27;t like it.\n\n</code></pre>\nI haven’t seen Barry Lyndon, so I can’t agree with you or explain why it’s enjoyable as well as beautifully constructed. But not enjoying such a film is certainly no cause for contempt. There are lots and lots of things like this. Not everyone enjoys sitting for five hours of Siegfried. Mahler isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, no matter how educated their ear. And Gravity’s Rainbow... Well the HN discussion of the book provoked much the same type of discussion.<p>A lot of the social behaviour you seem to be lamenting are associated with the fact that many such works of art require a certain education and progressive experience to appreciate. Bebop just sounds “frenetic” to the ear that hadn’t been listening to Swing for a decade. Modal Jazz sounds ”pleasant but meandering” to the ear that hadn’t been listening to Bebop for a decade. And so forth.<p>But when you have the foundation in place, you appreciate the way Bebop broke from Swing, and Modal broke from Bebop. But without the foundation, you get nothing. So some people, being tribal and wanting to self identify through contempt for others, will measure your fitness for belonging to their club by whether you have the educated ear to appreciate Free Jazz, or some such.<p>It’s not that much different than looking down our noses at people who don’t appreciate the “obvious” brilliance of higher-kinded types and monads. Sometimes, people don’t appreciate them because they don’t have the education in place (whether formal or not). But sometimes, they have the education but it simply doesn’t “click.” There is taste and personal experience involved, not just an absolute standard of aesthetic appeal.<p>In my own case, I had trouble with appreciating the albums  “In a Silent Way” and “Bitch’s Brew” when I first heard them, even though I was studying Jazz and thought I had the right stuff to get into them. I thought I understood intellectually what was going on, but nevertheless they didn’t speak to my heart.<p>I came back to them perhaps a decade after I first heard them, and as it happened, I began to feel them, not just listen to them. But that doesn’t happen to everyone. If it doesn’t, there is no need to beat someone up over it, but then again, it doesn’t mean that the work of art is a fraud, and that everyone is standing around a blank canvas marvelling at the brush strokes the artist chose not to employ.<p>In the end, a movie like Barry Lyndon fits the old quip:<p><pre><code>  A “classic” is a book everyone wants to have read, but few want to read.\n</code></pre>\nThe people raving about it are the few that wanted to see it, saw it, and liked what <i>they</i> saw, while most of the world wants to have seen it. That’s no insult to anybody, so please don’t take offence.<p>---<p>p.s. This is a a whole ‘nother topic, but the expression “good taste” does not actually refer to taste that is good in some absolute sense. It is a term that refers to having taste in common with the upper classes of society at a particular time and place. Lots and lots of excellent and fine things were not “in good taste,” and many things in good taste are now thought of quite poorly. “Good taste” is a measure of fashion more than anything else.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_%28sociology%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taste_%28sociology%29</a>",1454330363

It&#x27;s just a bunch of &quot;just so&quot; stories that are tested in some of the flimsiest ways (one phenomenon demonstrated to a statistically significant degree -- therefore that must have been &quot;the reason for the evolutionary change&quot;).<p>Listen, tons of features that an animal has are not correlated so highly to survival as to make enough selective pressure to make that feature come to completely dominate a population. I am very skeptical of the widely &quot;held&quot; assumption otherwise.<p>For example, lets say the human anorectal angle was specifically &quot;evolved&quot; for pooping while squatting. Is it a &quot;just so&quot; story or did the exact anorectal angle contribute SO MUCH to survival or reprosuction that it became the standard for bipedal humans?<p>Consider just how much relative advantage with survival and replication any given feature must have in order to come to dominate ALL the other features that are competing in the population. And this is in just one area. During a single reproduction, there are tons of genetic and epigenetic variables that could be selected for, which determine different things. Why would a specific feature in a specific part of the body, that provides merely a minor improvement at any given time, come to completely replace all other genotype expressions? I have never seen a good analysis of this, just hopeful handwaving, especially in popular books like The Selfish Gene.",1454328648

There are plenty of such places, globally.  As more and more people realize that it&#x27;s unnecessary to assemble in specific places I think we&#x27;ll see a sea change.

I&#x27;m less than 3 years into my career, but I think I&#x27;ve worked for some of the best companies with great pay, benefits, environments, etc, including a tech giant and two startups. End of the day though, work is boring. Its always work. Your time and effort is going towards making someone else rich and their\n    priorities are more important than your own.\n    The only things I really look forward to are vacations and events outside of work. Learning things is always exciting and sometimes its extremely rewarding\n    getting a project (or even a feature) off the ground and seeing a company rise and beat projections. But then a few weeks later, its just back to work and\n    nothings really different. Its a temporary victory at best, then expectations just get higher and more grind.\n</code></pre>\nI can second this. I have been working in the industry for 10 years and I figured that while I work for (probably big) companies and code someone else&#x27;s ideas I&#x27;m stuck. Not to mention that the bigger the company the more enterprisy the software.<p>That&#x27;s why I started to do my own development on my own ideas at home. Ever since I started to do so I&#x27;m feeling much better. I regularly contribute to GitHub projects as well. I also feel rejuvenated by being LEAN and using the fewest possible 3rd party libraries. Now I know the code I&#x27;m using since I can see the source of all libraries I use and they are much simpler than the enterprise stuff. I&#x27;m sure that after a number of successful side projects I will be able to work on my stuff full time. This is my primary focus at the moment and the thought of achieving this makes me more happier now reaching a 7/10.",1454328254

When you say something that goes beyond that agenda, <i>even if what you say is true</i>, you risk annoying the other participants, not just because you’re injecting noise into the communications channel, but because you’re asserting a right to change the agenda of the conversation.  If you do this often enough, they are more likely to come away with the impression that you’re arrogant and rude than remember your corrections to their false understandings of the world.",1264604282

Neither mode of thought is worth condemning. Makes enough sense.<p>But consider the following:
140 is the same character limit as Twitter. ""Duh, he already knew that. That's why he chose 150: to NOT be the same as Twitter."" Whoa, you're right, you're right, but hold on there, cowboy. If you were to have the exact same character limit as Twitter, you could let users post items, respond to posts, and communicate with other users <i>via Twitter</i>!<p>How HUGE would <i>that</i> be? You know what the 100-foot-tall hurdle for EVERY Craigslist competitor ever is? The chicken-and-egg problem. Hell, as soon as I clicked your site and searched my area for ""rent"", I knew (well, thought) 'chicken-and-egg' talk was, by itself, going to be the only content of my feedback post.<p>The users won't come if you don't have any postings, but you won't have many postings unless you only have a few users. Growth is usually very difficult to achieve in these scenarios. But if you utilize Twitter to the best of your ability, it's like hijacking a chicken farm truck on its way to the supermarket. The truck, incidentally, will either look like it's carrying a lifetime supply of Easter decorations, <i>sans</i> paint and frustration, or like a German POW-transport vehicle circa 1940 (zing, Frenchies!)(just kidding, I love French people)(I hear they make great toast). Depends on which (eggs vs. chickens) are users and which are item postings in our analogy. The point is you get a ton of users on the cheap.<p>Where to go beyond there:<p>a) Make all forms of typed communication (person-to-person convo, item posts, et al.) possible via Twitter. For example, get some tweetbots to relay posts for that user's desired geographical area(s) and/or desired categories (""I need a used TV really bad! I know, I'll 'follow' the TownFlierElectronics(1) tweetbot!"" Bam. Free targeted ads, increased user return rate, superlow barrier for users to relay info about your site/communicate with their followers about you, i.e. word-of-mouth advertising, the <i>Holy Grail</i>). BUT...<p>b) Leave what else you can on your site (pictures of items, contact info, maps, et al.) and <i>be sure people know those things are available over there</i>, just one click away. Consider automatically inserting <i>[PIC]</i> on the end of item-post-tweets, for example. Massive jump in traffic if you exploit that to the best of your ability. And a massive jump in traffic means a massive jump in revenue, amirite? ;)<p>(1) Obviously, implicit here is yet another recommendation; namely, go register a Twitter account for every TownFlier[city/area name], every TownFlier[category], and every TownFlier[popular/common keyword] you can think of. Throw in some others too, of course: TownFlier[news or blog/special deals or freebies/whatever you want].<p>I'll leave it to you to figure out how you want to accept item post/reply/etc. information (i.e., anything you are or could cap under 140 characters) <i>from</i> the user's Twitter account <i>through</i> your tweetbots <i>to</i> your site. Surely, there are plenty of options-- so many that whatever I might've recommended would likely not have been the optimal solution by sheer statistical probability.<p>c) Hardest to accomplish, and high risk/very high reward: Brand yourself as Twitter's Craigslist. Unless that already exists. I have no idea. A pun (even a visual one, like just the logo) involving tweeting/Twitter/birds in general and Town<i>Flier</i> can't be that hard to come up with. Maybe work in '140' somehow, if you can.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>Hope this helps, and good luck with your startup.<p>.<p>.<p>.<p>(<i>Fuck</i>, I love talking product and market strategy. Too bad I can't hack for shit...yet.)",1264602233

In a previous life, I used to work on a (commercial) product with similar capabilities. I'm also not the sort of database superhero that can just spew optimal SQL effortlessly. In fact, I do tend to think at a level closer to relational algebra.<p>I've just come to find such abstraction layers less useful in the typical web app. They seem to be more applicable in an enterprise app setting where portability is important, control over the schema might be limited or non-existent, the performance and scalability requirements are more predictable. In a web app, the structural complexity of the data is often low or the data is not well-representable in relational form (note the rise in popularity of non-relational stores). Performance requirements are harder to predict. Adding an relational algebra abstraction layer in that context often doesn't add enough value to justify the increase in complexity - you still end up having to understand the entire depth of the stack while getting little benefit from the extra capabilities it offers beyond the warm fuzzy feeling of using something pretty neat.",1264601909

<i>In Japan it can mean 'money'; if you're doing business in Japan and you make this sign for 'OK' a Japanese may think you're asking them for a bribe. In some Mediterranean countries it's an orifice signal, often used to infer that a man is homosexual. Show a Greek man the OK signal and he may thinkyou're inferring you or he is gay, while a Turk might thinkyou're calling him an 'arsehole'. It's rare in Arab countries where it is used as either a threat signal or as an obscenity.<p>In the 1950s, before he became President, Richard Nixon visited Latin America on a goodwill tour to try to patch up strained relations with the locals. As he stepped out of his plane he showed the waiting crowds the American 'OK' signal and was stunned as they began booing and hissing at him Being unaware of local body language customs, Nixon's OK signal had been read as 'You're all a bunch of arseholes.'</i><p>Entertainingly written and bite-sized chapters that will doubtless help you in your daily face-to-face communications.",1264601192

For example, if you interrupt someone mid-sentence to correct something insignificant, then that's rude.
Waiting for the person to finish talking and then immediately correcting something they said earlier gives the other person the impression that you weren't listening to what they were saying.  There are better ways of dealing with this in conversation.  One of them is simply to ignore irrelevant inaccuracies.<p>Calling it ""altruistic behaviour to educate"" is also disingenuous.  I've met many geeks who thrive on expounding minutiae about irrelevant or insignificant topics at the most inappropriate moments, all for the sake of recognition.  It's the same as when jocks try to impress others by being macho.  Obviously not all geeks are like that, but they definitely exist.  My dad is geek who is like this but for him it's also about self-affirmation.<p>Finally, I often see articles on the net trying to explain ""geeky"" social interaction, but I rarely read articles specifically targeted at people with these tendencies describing how to improve their social skills.

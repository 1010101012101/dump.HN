6219872,story,,,1,0,sjaakkkkk,"Ask HN: What is the best way to do visit based A/B Tests?",,"I am currently involved with A/B testing for a big website and am running into some problems. I&#x27;d love to hear whether you guys here on HN have run into this type of problem?<p>While I am familiar with testing typical page-to-page conversion, at this project we are looking at differences in users&#x27; behavior in a total visit. For example we are looking whether a change in &#x27;people also bought&#x27;-algorithm which is shown at multiple places on the site is changing total conversions on a per visit level. So we look op total visits for a segment, then total conversions and then look at differences between A and B in conversions/visit.<p>To get data for the two versions we create segments in Google Analytics. The problem I currently have tough comes partly from sampling issues. 
- Since we have millions of pageviews per day, even on a daily level I still get a sample rate showing only 15% of visits
- Because the conversion is relatively small per visit (~0.1 per visit) the data sampling issue seems to get even worse
- Regardless of the data sampling issues, I think we should have per visit based data in order to be able to calculate the variance of the particular conversion of interest occurring with which we can than compare the means and test whether it&#x27;s significant.<p>To show the problem I did some experimenting with using our methodology and splitting our control group in two and then test as if the one half of the control group was a B version. Using our current, flawed, methodology I get &#x27;significantly&#x27; different results for both groups.<p>So I have a couple of questions:
- How do you guys handle visits based AB tests? (and is this even a thing?)
- Are there any tools that capture per visit data like described above?
- Do you know any good resources on AB testing that go further than simple page-to-page tests but really get into testing at a visit level?<p>Any thoughts are greatly appreciated!",1376593154

6219859,comment,6217252,6219428,1,0,etherael,,,"re mutualism, of all the variants of leftist anarchism I am familiar with, this one does indeed appeal to me the most. The problem I have with it is only the idea that as soon as anyone who has invested labor into real estate vacates the property, it is supposed to be perfectly ethical / justifiable to simply appropriate it. This puts all kinds of peculiar incentives in play for owners of real estate to avoid losing their property by maintaining &quot;occupancy&quot; of it, which is in itself kind of a nebulous and strange definition.<p>If we build a server farm and use it for staging and then push that environment to production and we&#x27;re not actively using staging for the next month, is it OK to appropriate that? If you spend many years of labour constructing your own home and all associated facilities, is it acceptable that when you go on holiday to some remote location, it should instantly be up for grabs?<p>If it&#x27;s just a case of being unable to enforce absentee ownership for any given interval, I think this is both a terrible failure of imagination on the part of mutualists as well as an undeserved tip of the hat to that old &quot;might makes right&quot; chestnut. We <i>can</i> take your property, therefore it is not yours anymore.<p>I&#x27;ll admit there are problems with the concept of ancap homesteading also; the mutualist criticism of &quot;rearranging a few twigs on a parcel of land not entitling the arranger to title in perpetuity&quot; is not without basis, natural resources and real property are quite thorny and difficult to disentangle concepts by nature. This is why the original suggestion of a thousand competing political systems flourishing is even more appealing to me then just every space on earth appropriating the ancap model as laid out in &quot;the machinery of freedom&quot;.<p>Through competition and the market, we can see how things play out in the real world and what people end up preferring. I have no problem with any political philosophy insofar as they keep to themselves and do not attempt to enforce their ideas on those that are unable to choose an alternative, which unfortunately as the status quo stands is almost no place on the planet.",1376593018

6219843,comment,6217968,6217968,4,0,robomartin,,,"At the core, the use of threads for any embedded system required to operate in hard real time is a mistake.  Threads and interrupts are the minefields of real-time embedded systems.<p>Based on study and years of experience I conclude that the ONLY way to build such as system is to use a time-triggered approach as opposed to event-triggered.  No threads.  Only one interrupt --the timer-- in the entire system if at all possible.<p>This is where I fall back to the raw simplicity of C.  You really have to work hard to do stupid shit like threads in C.  By that I mean that you have to go out of your way to bring in the code and a framework that might allow you to do that.  I&#x27;ve successfully written and applied at least a couple of RTOS&#x27;s for use in  mission critical applications (definition:  you fuck up and someone gets hurt or dies).  Again, only one interrupt.  No threads.  Carefully --and I do mean very carefully-- shared data between tasks only if absolutely necessary.<p>A corollary to this is that I could not fathom programming an electron microscope (the subject of the SO question) or anything that might lead to millions of dollars in losses with Java.  Couldn&#x27;t pay me enough.<p>Anyone interested in working with hard real-time embedded systems would be wise to study the following well-known books:<p><pre><code>  - Patterns for Time-Triggered Embedded Systems, Michael J.

  - Embedded Systems Building Blocks, Jean J. Labrosse
  - uC/OS-III, Jean J. Labrosse  (uC/OS-II by the same author includes

An atomic cluster is sort of a jelly ball of atoms, where the orbitals, rather than being organized into nice molecular bonds, have become nonlocal and the whole thing acts as a sort of &quot;superatom&quot;. They can carry a charge, as in the Zintl clusters e.g. Pb_9(4-): nine lead atoms with four extra electrons. In some very rare cases the clusters form metastable compounds.<p>When I asked de Heer&#x27;s opinion on producing condensates of clusters, he said quickly &quot;it&#x27;s a bomb!&quot;.

But yeah, Beautifulsoup bit might actually run a bit slower if it is only doing parsing. (!unless there is a C extension underneath that does release the GIL!)<p>Any discussion of Python and threads is always confusing and it seems to me there aren&#x27;t many people who understand how it works (I know you do, not talking about your comment, just in general).<p>In one camp you have people who like to write how Python is no good and threads are just broken. Never use them.  In the other camp are people who say threads are fine, they work great, I never had any issues with them. A lot of time people in this camp are just reacting to the ones in the first camp but also without understanding the underlying mechanism.<p>I think the first thing that should be mentioned in any introductory article on Python threads is that Python threads work great for IO concurrency but they won&#x27;t help with CPU concurrency. Things like downloading files, sending data over a socket will work nicely. Thing like computing determinants won&#x27;t. You can still structure your code in a threaded fashion so can use multiprocessing module in the future but you won&#x27;t get a speed up. So threads are not completely unusable and broken but they also have a surprising limitation.<p>Overall in Python in my career I probably deal more with IO concurrency and threads helped there quite a bit. Others will have a different experience depending on their area of expertise.<p>Also it is worth mentioning that libraries like Numpy and C extensions in general have the option of releasing the GIL if they want to they can get a speedup. I have done this once by hand and it did help (with a hand written extension). Didn&#x27;t personally test numpy&#x27;s speedup.<p>ADDITION:<p>It is also worth mentioning that even though you not get a speedup for CPU related concurrency, you still  have to deal with synchronization issues.

The issue is that as soon as you start to define an area of experience, your hiring pool shrinks dramatically. Consequently you are more likely to pick a less powerful engineer. Another, bigger downside here is that companies are terrible at figuring out what they really need. Consequently you&#x27;ve hired someone who can do A and B but one month in you realize that the thing you were missing is really C. A less powerful engineer will have a harder time transitioning over to doing C work, and you&#x27;ll be worse off. Moreover they might be upset - they came in with the expectation of doing A & B, and they&#x27;re sitting here doing something unrelated instead. Can&#x27;t count the number of times I&#x27;ve seen this happen, to both the employee&#x27;s and company&#x27;s detriment.<p>The thing that this article misses is how to avoid hiring jerks. Terrible employees can be a net negative to a company. Jerks, particularly those in senior positions, are the thermonuclear version of terrible employees. They can demotivate and destroy the productivity of entire teams and cause your best engineers to rage-quit. The best interviewing tactic I&#x27;ve seen to weed out these people is watching how someone behaves when you &quot;play dumb&quot; in an interview. See if they&#x27;re happy to explain something to you, or if they get impatient with your lack of knowledge. A related trick is challenging them on something that is obviously correct - see if they carefully prove why their answer is correct, or become antagonistic. Really smart people are good, but much more effective are those that can help bring everyone else up to their level.",1376591542

With a loose CORS policy (the &quot;-o &#x27;*&#x27;) this can be used directly in a user&#x27;s browser via AJAX requests.<p>There&#x27;s obviously a lot of security issues to think about here, the primary one is that without authentication anybody that is network accessible to the server can execute anything.

That is pretty straightforward with intents and you can either show every available app or specify exactly what other apps to allow. Also, we added an intent receiver so any app can share into ours. I have tested it across about 20 devices and have had 0 issues with the inter-app intents. The camera took more work but there are lots of libraries out there to solve the problems (mainly: where to store the file generated by the camera cleanly in all cases). Gallery also causes some issues because various vendors have re-implemented the gallery in non-standard ways, and remote URLs for Picassa or Google+ need to be dealt with, but it&#x27;s not too bad.<p>If you are writing good quality code, fragmentation is completely overblown.",1376590344

We looked at tens of thousands of interviews, and everyone who had done the interviews and what they scored the candidate, and how that person ultimately performed in their job. We found zero relationship. Its a complete random mess, except for one guy who was highly predictive because he only interviewed people for a very specialized area, where he happened to be the worlds leading expert.&quot;<p>That being said, there are a lot of very disorganized interviewers out there, especially among seed stage companies. I&#x27;ve been amazed about how many people grumble about the &quot;talent shortage&quot;, yet regularly miss interviews with &quot;hot&quot; candidates because of meetings, forget them altogether, or just lack a sense of urgency & speed when it comes to running an effective hiring process.<p>A large part of having a hiring culture is about decisiveness. Loosing a fantastic Engineer because you spent 4 weeks making up your mind, or you didn&#x27;t want to pay an extra $10K/year is just silly when it means that you won&#x27;t hit your product roadmap goals.",1376590340

    Producer:

The assertion is wrong, when you&#x27;re dealing with relaxed atomics. For example, the producer can be optimized into this either by the compiler or by caching layers:<p><pre><code>        int savedUpA = 0
        while true:
            savedUpA++

In which case the consumer will often see that postA != postB.<p>Thankfully, languages are apparently converging on &quot;every atomic write is a release barrier&quot; and &quot;every atomic read is an acquire barrier&quot;, which makes these sorts of optimizations illegal (releasing B&#x27;s new value requires releasing A&#x27;s new value).",1376589931

I am not quite certain how issues Apple runs into with Xcode are relevant (and talking about hypothetical future IDEs, which certainly would not be FreeBSD-specific and which would treat clang as any other library to depend on, doesn&#x27;t make the motivation any more clear to me).<p>To address your second paragraphs, I am responding to a comment (yours) justifying why clang should spend time on their website making comparisons against gcc 4.2, a stance you defend by stating that that is the version that people are using instead of clang. Now, in your response to my defense against that point, you are bringing up legitimate technical benefits of clang against all versions of gcc...<p>...but I would never, nor have I so far in this thread, complained that those benefits didn&#x27;t exist; I especially haven&#x27;t claimed that those version-independent architecture benefits shouldn&#x27;t be mentioned on their website. My complaint, remember, is that there are specific nebulous benefits (error output) being touted against gcc 4.2 as the &quot;most notable&quot; (according to the SO answer being discussed) technical be benefit of this project.<p>That specific benefit only exists because of a licensing decision, as gcc after-4.2 does not have error output this bad (not do I believe it did in 4.3 trunk at the time that website was published). The honest reason, if &quot;error output&quot; is important, as to why clang is better than gcc for FreeBSD is thereby &quot;licensing&quot;, as if licensing weren&#x27;t the real reason that benefit evaporates: it is no better than just pointing out that gcc 4.2 is unmaintained.<p>However, and again, you are more than welcome to be happy or excited about any other real benefits, either to other parties or the ones in question, but your comments in this context are anticipating complaints I haven&#x27;t made and in fact is aggressively arguing with me over something I don&#x27;t even disagree with: it is as if you see anyone complaining about clang and presume &quot;they must just be a hater&quot; and knee-jerk your way through a muscle-memory argument over &quot;why clang is better&quot; (something I have no strong opinion about).",1376589835

You have to work out whether your roots have so entwined together that it is inconceivable that you should ever part. Because this is what love is. Love is not breathlessness, it is not excitement, it is not the promulgation of promises of eternal passion, it is not the desire to mate every second minute of the day, it is not lying awake at night imagining that he is kissing every cranny of your body. No, don&#x27;t blush, I am telling you some truths. That is just being &quot;in love&quot;, which any fool can do. Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident. Louis de Bernires, Captain Corelli&#x27;s Mandolin",1376589675

Some kind of death-rattle clause.  If your company doesn&#x27;t make it or shuts down this service, all the code necessary to set up the service would be released under a permissive license, something like that.<p>2. The ability, even if it had a high cost ($100k a year or something crazy), to license the source to the engine that powers Firebase and deploy a modified version (obviously just for our own use).<p>I think those two things would mean that if I were making decisions on the technical direction of a company or large project, I wouldn&#x27;t feel like Firebase might suddenly cause a major disruption in the future.  At least if there were a major incident or insurmountable problem with the service, we could bring it in house and proceed without having to go back and re-engineer all the previous work.",1376589605

It's far easier to make sure people integrate properly by providing a rich, well-documented API client library than it is to rely solely on the REST-based one.  REST APIs are hard to document, and require a lot of orthogonal boilerplate to even make the requests properly.<p>Making a client library is also a great way to ""dogfood"" your REST API - you know a developer will write code, not HTTP calls, to interact with your service.  The client API allows you to test out that code and make sure your API is well designed.",1353430766

For example, an alternative to driving to work is to bike or walk.  It's cold out side, so I need a jacket or sweater.  Can you call or email me when you get the results.  In all these cases, the A or B construct is used to tie together items that share something (alternatives to driving, cold-weather add on clothing, and methods of communication, in these three cases).",1353430766
4809892,comment,4808587,4809611,1,0,daniel-cussen,,,"Which brings us full circle to Copyright reform.<p>Copyright (as opposed to patents, pushed by Intellectual Ventures et al) is pushed by Hollywood.  Hollywood, composed of television and radio media, which heavily cross-hires with film and music.  In other words: the same people who own a radio station might use their knowledge of acoustics, their installations, their relationship with relevant engineers, bring in appropriate celebrities, and so forth, so that this form of horizontal expansion is an effective, and therefore common one.  Film and TV, radio and music, and all four, are frequently in the same hands.  So we have the voice and the asset:  entertainment being the asset, news coverage being the opinion-forming political capital.<p>Hollywood's greatest political asset is not, as many believe, its lobbying.  Certainly it engages in lobbying; most industries do.  But the true, cocky power of Hollywood is its influence over its viewers.<p>I forget most of the numbers, but I remember that in Peru, during the Fuji Mori (dictatorship) years, the government paid bribes to members within and without it.  Within it:  judges, and many others.  Without it: television station owners!  Yes sir, the largest bribes, far and away, were paid to television station owners; bribes in the millions, in a country where nobody had millions.  The moral of the story?  Media has a lot of political capital.<p>So what we're left with is, Hollywood would have a strong, even gravitational, influence over Congress even without lobbying, merely because of the millions of people it influences into voting one way or another.<p>In other words, it molds the consent of the governed.",1353430748

The only thing your registrar does is to allow you to renew your domain name and to change your DNS entries; this canonical data is not stored with them.<p>You do not need to do that every day: you don't even need to do that every year. If your registrar went offline, tomorrow, for months on end, the only way you'd ever notice (assuming your DNS provider didn't go offline) is that whois would not return detailed information for your domain.<p>However, if/when your DNS goes offline, you are hosed: anyone without a cached copy of your records (which in the end is a very large number of users, even with long cache times) no longer can access your website; they are truly a point of failure.<p>How do you fix that? Well, you go to your registrar, whom you hope is online that day, and you change your DNS servers to point to someone else. Your registrar is your backup: they are the people you need online only during on that rare day when your DNS is offline.<p>Now, if you take any DNS service out there, even the most reliable, it is going to be offline someday for some reason for at least some of your users: they may have multiple locations, but today the east coast got destroyed by a hurricane, and all of your users in the relatively safe state of KY are still being forwarded to NJ? Well, maybe you want to fix that.<p>Having a registrar that is not your DNS provider means that there is now some chance that you can do that. When the DNS service is working, the registrar doesn't cause you any issues: if it goes offline you aren't even going to notice.<p>Yes, there's some astronomical chance that the registrar does something insane, like has a glitch that deletes your domain name from the root servers... but frankly, that kind of glitch is going to be uncorrelated from outages and might happen no matter where you host it: the registrar is your one truly infrastructure-mandated single thing you have to trust to not do things that are insane (but thankfully don't have to trust are online).<p>This ""trust not to do something insane"" is then then how you need to choose your registrar, and it is not how you probably choose anything else in your stack. This is much more of a legal than a technical issue, as pointed out by one of the only other comments on this thread that seems to understand this (the short one by troels).<p>However, having your DNS (along with whatever else: HTTP, database, anything else you may use; none of this is important: DNS is king) at the same place as your registrar is just a death sentence for reliability. You've even given up your option to just point the domain at a ""sorry, we are offline, please try again tomorrow"" page.<p>I now will point out (again[1]), that this is basic prerequisite knowledge for running a website. Before you spend time deciding things like ""Ruby or Clojure"", ""HBase or PostgreSQL"", and ""Linode or AWS"", you should learn how websites are put together, what DNS is, and what a registrar's purpose in the ecosystem really is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4502451"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4502451</a><p>As much as I like to think some of these other decisions can be critical to your ability to pivot later, if you don't know how a website works in the first place well enough to notice at a glance ""oh, if I host my registrar and DNS in the same place I'm screwed in the case of a single outage"" you have much more serious problems, and you aren't going to be able to make informed decisions anyway.<p>Truly, in the end, you can build a fine website using PHP, MongoDB, and hosted on a single machine in your janitorial closet; if nothing else, when it inevitably fails, you will be able to quickly migrate your DNS entries to a page saying ""we are sorry we are offline: we used bad technology"". ;P",1353430367

Granted there is decent LTE coverage here in Houston, but with no change in my usage habits I hit the 90% mark of the 4GB plan(I needed tethering, so I had to ""upgrade"") 18 days into the billing cycle. My main data consumption was iTunes match over cellular. I was getting constant buffer underruns with my iPhone 4 on 3g, but now Im hitting the data wall halfway through the billing cycle. Its now in AT&Ts best interest to open the pipe for me so I can pay overage fees.<p>I dont know that it would be better on a different carrier, but I certainly harbor no goodwill towards AT&T. I feel like Im one hassle away from buying out my contract.<p>Just getting my iPhone 5 proved to be a multi hour headache due to an AT&T agents royal screwup of my initial upgrade. I ordered a 64GB black phone, was shipped white. He also updated my home/billing address incorrectly(more on that later) I returned it, and they spent 2 hours reversing the upgrade and giving me a new sim for my iPhone 4. That took so long that I couldnt re-order the upgrade. A week later I used the AT&T website to order the new phone, however, it could only be shipped to the billing address that the AT&T agent mistyped when I originally ordered the phone. So I had to cancel the order. But it wasnt that simple. I am a ""premier"" account and premier support isnt open on weekends. I had to go to an AT&T store and cancel the order. Then I had to call premier support on monday and reverse the upgrade. The next weekend, they finally had some black 64GB iPhones in stock. I bought one. Guess what? it had an intermittent power button. I had to set up an appt with an apple store to get that fixed. Fortunately the Apple store experience was much better.

The reason you'd want to have a minimum allocation size is because it makes routing tables smaller (better for an organization to have just one entry in the routing table that's huge that they can grow into, than to start small and add lots of small entries to the routing table as they grow).<p>Second, /48 is what ISPs typically give their subscribers, not what ISPs themselves get.<p>Edit: to clarify, the /32 minimum is a policy of ARIN and RIPE (not sure about the other RIRs).  See for example <a href=""https://www.arin.net/policy/archive/ipv6_policy.html#43"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arin.net/policy/archive/ipv6_policy.html#43</a> and <a href=""http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-552#minimum_allocation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ripe.net/ripe/docs/ripe-552#minimum_allocation</a>.  There is no mandatory policy for how ISPs should assign addresses to their subscribers.  RFC3177 recommended a /48 in most cases, though that has recently been superseded by RFC6177, which recommends more flexibility rather than a one-size-fits all approach.  See <a href=""http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6177"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6177</a>.<p>I find the article somewhat reckless in recommending that you ban entire /64s instead of individual IPv6 addresses.  It's true that you need to be aware that a home user will likely be in control of an entire /64 (and possibly more), but if the offending IP address is at a university or a datacenter then a /64 ban could sweep up a lot of innocent bystanders.

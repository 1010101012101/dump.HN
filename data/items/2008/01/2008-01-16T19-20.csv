99404,comment,99351,99351,0,0,kurtosis,,,"Does anyone have a link to more detailed information about the ""signal"" that was detected?  I'm very ignorant of SETI and radio astronomy - what does it mean to ""decode"" such a signal?

Ignore the crufty Occam (Transputer anyone?) syntax, just concentrate on the concepts.  Although some of the PDFs seem to have many pages, often a page is the same as the previous with a minor change;  they're slides!",1200512291

Quote from Jim Rohn - ""If all you get from your job is a paycheck, you're underpaid"" I think it's hard to do be good at something if you don't like it - I remember near-falling asleep in some boring (to me) subjects - I think some people are awake but asleep at their job.",1200511048

99388,comment,99255,99363,0,0,wallflower,,,"I remember seeing The Titanic many years ago when it came out. During the scene where Kate Winslet poses topless for Leonardo, the artist, I was sitting next to a couple with their 8-or-9-ish year old children. It took a couple delayed seconds for the husband to react and shield his kid's eyes. During that time, the kids didn't flinch; the parents eventually did. Perhaps the kids didn't see anything wrong with seeing boobies - but now they associate them with something forbidden.",1200510669

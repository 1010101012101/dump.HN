I see the mornings as a time of hope and possibility ('imagine all that you can get done today'). No one says to themselves, 'oh, I hope today is crappy'. Not a surprise then that I actually get more 'depressed' as the day goes on (ie, afternoon and onward) and it's not necessarily dependent on how much I've accomplished or not, but rather that the realm of what is possible has dwindled.<p>Coffee is also my friend. I have between 1 and 1.5 cups per day but just getting up and feeling like Success Kid, per a mix of caffeine and hope, gets me going in the right direction.",1345424350

It was also top-secret at the time; that explains its mystique.<p>As far as being a superior choice, I don't think it's quite apples to apples.  Project Orion (nuclear pulse propulsion) was designed to get very large payloads directly into orbit.  Nuclear thermal rockets like NERVA were apparently designed to be used as drop-in replacements for upper stages on conventional chemical rockets, or as space ""tugs"" in orbit.  That might imply that it was difficult to design a nuclear thermal rocket which would deliver the high initial thrust(?) necessary to lift a payload directly out of our gravity well <i>(but IANA rocket scientist, so I may be mistaken on this)</i>.  That said, a small blurb on Wikipedia does mention that ""Robert Bussard proposed the Single-Stage-To-Orbit ""Aspen"" vehicle using a nuclear thermal rocket for propulsion and liquid hydrogen propellant[...]"" -- so maybe it would indeed have been a superior design choice in the end.",1345423953

All the added stress has made me neglect my family and definitely eliminated any personal time.<p>I decided to do something about it in June.<p>Exercise has made a big impact. I started running almost every morning and logging 20M+ weekend mountain bike rides. I've realized that you need to keep your cardio strong and your physique honed or the lifestyle will simply make you pudgy and listless. Great Founders know how to eat right, work out right, and feel right. This is like running a marathon, so you must live your life like a marathon runner. I've also heard that its good to do some sport where you can hit something. Tennis, boxing, hockey, or martial arts, let you hit something hard and get the negative energy out.<p>I used to stay up working until 3 or 4am quite regularly but now walk away from my computer by 1AM so that I can get at least 6 hours of sleep.

Note that Adobe AIR doesn't require this anymore: <a href=""http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/air3-install-and-deployment-options.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/articles/air3-install-and-de...</a><p>If you're providing a useful tool to already-committed users of your website, this might not be an issue.<p>If slightly non-native looks aren't a concern, go with whatever's easiest. I'd choose Qt/C++, but I'm already comfortable with them. py2exe/py2app are probably reasonable if you know Python.<p>Consider outsourcing this if you can. The details will occupy a lot of your time. For instance: you ideally want both a standard Windows installer (put together with something like NSIS), and to sign your installer + installed executable to avoid Windows warning your users that it's probably malware. That's a day's work for someone who has done it before, probably a week for you to do it the first time.<p>EDIT: that said, if you do outsource, beware that most contractors will be blind to their preferred environment's sore spots. Java+Swing devs don't account for Swing apps looking like ass, .NET devs don't care that needing to find, download and install the <i>Microsoft .NET 4.5 Runtime Environment</i> pisses your users off and hurts conversion rates, etc.<p>EDIT 2: test, test, and test some more. Just because your app runs fine on Windows XP doesn't mean it will work fine on Windows 7 64-bit, and vice versa. If you're eligible (most startups are), it's worth signing up to Microsoft BizSpark just to get access to ISOs of every Windows version from XP up from MSDN.",1345423519

Overall it feels pretty weird and unintuitive from my point of view.<p>First thing I tried was uploading some images on it, but can't upload files via USB storage, have to use iTunes for that. I'm a linux user, so had to install windows on VirtualBox and then forward the USB por to virtualized iTunes. After doing that I realize that can't just place files on the filesystem, files are bound to a particular application, so I have to upload the images to an image viewer, and that program ""owns"" the files. Also apps seem to be isolated from each other, when on Android they often communicate via ""intents"".<p>Then I went to the App Store to get some apps to get started, and it asked me to create an Apple Id, I entered the info, then it asked me for credit card number.. I just wanted to get some free apps and skip the credit card part, but it didn't let me continue without it. So cancelled the Apple Id creation, went googling, and after a few tries managed to create the Apple Id account without registering a credit card (you need to download a free app). Seems that it's persuading you to enter a credit card, since the ""none"" payment option wasn't visible by default. After browsing the store for a while, most of the apps are paid and it's pretty hard to get free apps. You can't really get any decent app without paying, on Android 90% of the apps you'll use everyday are free.<p>So, overall it feels limited, there is no contact with the underlying filesystem or OS, most apps have very poor or zero configuration, and trivial tasks (like uploading files from your PC) require extra cumbersome steps. Seems to be designed as a device for consuming, a toy, not something you're gonna work with. My desktop computer is far superior than an iPad.",1345421800

Have a control system that allows multiple batteries to be combined, in a hot swappable manner, within a single installation.<p>Advantages:<p>1) Economies of scale allow lower battery price, since the same pack is used everywhere.<p>2) Common form factor allows batteries to be physically swapped (instant recharge for a car).<p>3) Redundancy, if one battery breaks, the system can keep working, with reduced capacity, until a replacement is bought.<p>4) With the right control system it should be possible to transfer energy between batteries as required, allowing the car to be charged in-situ from the house, or the house to take energy from the car, if needed.  The car can even be used to transfer energy from an external source into the domestic setting, the electrical equivalent of an oil tanker.<p>5) More efficient use of available capacity, by combining all batteries into a single system, they will be used more often, rather than sitting unused while people sleep or drive.",1345421672

""What program did you use to do this last time?  Good, start that program.  What do you mean what do I.... [sigh] Okay, where do you go to start programs?  Great.  Yes, go there.""  They know everything but sometimes they seem incapable of putting it together.  Life's like that for some people.  You make a pot of coffee at 8pm, you skip a workout, you work when you should relax and relax when you should work.  You avoid activities that make you happy and spend your time on things that just make you tired.  You procrastinate paying a parking ticket (non-negotiable, takes five minutes) because reloading the national news seems more urgent.  In some sense you know everything you need to know.  You're like a befuddled computer user who seems completely helpless but who only needs a couple of simple reminders to get back on the right track.<p>There are many ways to characterize or explain why people who can describe a clear path to a better life have trouble following it.  One way is to label it a deficit in executive function.  To me it doesn't feel right to call it a deficit.  I think of it as chronic interference with or co-option of the executive function by other factors.  But either way, whether you think of it as weak executive function or a normal executive function overpowered by interference, the inmates are running the asylum, and your executive function is the asylum director cowering in his office mumbling, ""I am in control.  I told them to set the mattresses on fire; that was my idea.""<p>The purpose of self-help writing is to put the executive function back in charge.  For a lot of people, all they need is a brief reminder and a little injection of optimism, and a five-minute read like this blog post is useful for that.  It's also important to grapple with the psychological factors that hijack your executive function in the first place, but if a few minutes of fluffy reading can do the trick for right now, there's no reason to say no to it.",1345421418

You'll expend energy with rocket thrust, and all else being equal, rocket thrust is most efficiently used for orbital maneuvering when done over a short time.<p>So you have energy collected over a long period of time, then released in a short period of time. That means you need to store that energy. It's not feasible to ship batteries up from the surface with current battery technology, since the energy/mass ratio is awful, so you'll need some other way to store the energy. Chemical storage would be one way. Use local materials and transform them into new materials with more chemical potential energy. Chemical storage tanks can be reasonably light. When the time comes, you can reverse the process and transform your stored chemicals back into electricity.<p>But wait, we don't actually want electricity, we want thrust. A traditional rocket engine is a great way of transforming chemical potential energy into thrust. So let's skip the electrical middleman, and burn our chemical energy storage reagents in a rocket engine.<p>All that's left to do is choose the chemicals.

I also don't like the social aspect. GOG gives me a downloadable game for easy transfer, gives me the ability to log in and re-download, their customer service is superb and it's pretty cheap. Come to think of it, I'd be more than willing to pay over the standard $10 for their games.",1369958264
5796024,comment,5795698,5795698,1,0,VikingCoder,,,"How can you say with a straight face, ""There is low inflation risk since the production of coins is algorithmically limited and has a cap at 21 million.""  Inflation is ""A general increase in prices and fall in the purchasing value of money.""  Meaning, one bitcoin has less purchasing power than it used to.  The purchasing power of Bitcoins plummeted recently, and everyone knows it.<p>""Payments are irreversible (there are no chargebacks), so there is a reduced risk of payment fraud.""  If I'm not mistaken, many people use intermediates like mtgox that don't actually keep your money in bitcoins.  Meaning, they reserve the right to reverse payments, and have done so on several occasions.  You can argue this is not an inherent problem in Bitcoins, but if many (most?) users are susceptible to the problem, I think you're remiss to gloss it over.<p>""Payments can be made without identification.""  But they're only pseudo-anonymous.  It's possible to track a bitcoin from me, to you, to someone else.<p>""Satoshi Nakamoto,"" I think it's crazy to not mention that Nakamoto is not a real person.<p>You mention Scarcity, but not divisibility.  There are 100 million satoshis per Bitcoin.<p>""Bitcoin's primary use so far has been to facilitate illegal activities such as drug dealing and money laundering.""  This is a strong assertion without evidence.",1369958252

5796022,comment,5791981,5792589,4,0,jlgreco,,,"> <i>future proof DESKTOP OS</i><p>This is something I obsess over.<p>Use minimalist software that you are fairly confident that you could fix or recreate in another environment if necessary; for example, don't use gnome-screensaver but instead use slock.  Where possible, use software suites where being future-proof is a first-class priority; for example, wherever possible use TeXLive.  Consider something standards complaint with a rabid user-base over alternatives; for example, use Vim instead of Kwrite. <i>(In fact, take a list of the packages in the current Ubuntu livecd, and the packages in the current Kubuntu livecd.  XOR the lists.  The result is a list of software you should not spent time building skills in if you don't want your skills to become obsolete in 5 years.)</i><p>Where you are not confident that you can pick something that meets any of these suggestions, pick the simplest software that you don't have to customize and that you will miss the least.  For example, don't roll your own X window manager and don't use BerylFusion after setting three dozen options.  Use firefox or chrome, but don't marry yourself to a combination of two dozen highly specialized extensions.<p>In an effort to future-proof my computer experience I follow these self-imposed restrictions.  Additionally, I have a strict whitelist of software that I am willing to configure: zsh, vim, tmux, elinks (only because I could bare to lose it. It is not future-proof), urxvt (<i>very</i> begrudgingly, I only set my font and background color), and Awesome (<i>very very very</i> begrudgingly.  The only configuration of it that I am willing to do is set my terminal to urxvt.)  Any other software I use ""as is"", with the expectation that it could be obsolete and abandoned tomorrow.<p>Brief example of something that drove me to adopt this sort of attitude: I used to use Amarok to play all of music, and got very used to my setup.  Amarok 2 came and wrecked everything, completely erasing all the mental effort I had put into Amarok over the years.  Upset by this, I decided that life would be simpler if I just wrote my own very simple xmms2 client that I would never change out from under myself.  This worked great for about two years until the breaking changes to xmms2 (requiring me to make changes to my client every few months) wore me down.  Now I just use mplayer, a shell, and standard unix utilities.  Even if I have to swap out mplayer I am confident I will never have to change my workflow again on a unix-like computer with keyboard.",1369958224

(Now, there are certainly deductible limits which may limit the amount patients may be <i>required</i> by insurers to pay out of pocket for things which are otherwise within the scope of the coverage of the insurance they have, but that's a very different thing than being prohibited to pay out of pocket.)",1369957931

I am talking about uninsured, the majority of our patients. Perhaps I could have added the word ""uninsured"" to my sentence:<p><i>uninsured</i> patients will no longer be able to pay out of pocket for medical care<p>That said your statement is very optimistic that the uninsured/underinsured patients who we cater to will not only be able to afford insurance in the future but be able to pay out of pocket for healthcare ""if they desire"".  It is more like if they can afford it, which they cannot which is why they are uninsured now.  Keep in mind many primary care copays are $50-$100 under existing insurance plans, which is going to be very difficult for these patients to pay under any circumstance, but especially in light of their new found insurance expense (maybe even an additional government penalty expense).  At least now an uninsured can come to us and get antibiotics for $30 ($20 1st month payment and $10 to see the ARNP or PA).",1369957507

Then under meager assumptions (e.g., i.i.d. and,
for likely the strongest conditions known,
the Lindeberg-Feller conditions), as n goes to infinity, the distribution of the result will converge to

5795901,comment,5794936,5794936,22,0,drostie,,,"I liked this but as other commenters have pointed out it's purely <i>binomial</i> at this stage. The great thing about the central limit theorem is that it is <i>more general</i> than just the limiting Binomial case.<p>So, there's this thing called the cumulant-generating function. It's pretty much defined for any random variable X. If you want to get technical it is the logarithm of the Fourier transform of a probability density function f(x). You're on HN so you probably know the first two jargon words, ""logarithm"" and ""Fourier transform"". A ""probability density"" just means that f(x) dx is the probability for X to be in the interval (x, x + dx). The Fourier transform puts us into a ""frequency space"" indexed by some variable k, so we can write the CGF as some function c(k), or in other words:<p><pre><code>    c(k) = ln[  dx f(x) exp(i k x) ]
</code></pre>
So for the ""step left/right"" variable which is -1 with probability 1/2 and +1 with probability 1/2, c(k) = ln[cos(k)]. (It can get a little messy when you ask what happens when cos(k) crosses 0 etc, but this function is infinitely-often differentiable on a disc centered at 0 which is all that we need.)<p>It also turns out that since the sum of all the probability  dx f(x) = 1, you can just evaluate this for k=0 as c(0) = ln[ 1 ] = 0. The cumulants are derivatives evaluated at k=0:<p><pre><code>    c'(0) = i E[X] = i                (where  is the ""expectation"")
    c''(0) = - (E[X] - E[X]) = -   (where  is the ""variance"")
    c'''(0) = -i E[(x - )] = -i   (where  is the ""skewness"")
</code></pre>
It is not very hard to prove that if I have a sum of two random variables X + Y = Z, then their CGFs add like cz(k) = cx(k) + cy(k). This is the Fundamental Awesomeness of Cumulants: cumulants are pseudo-linear; they're linear in <i>independent</i> random variables.<p>It is also not hard to prove that if I have a scalar multiplication U = X / n, then cu(k) = cx(k / n). Combining these together, the mean M = (X1 + X2 + ... + Xn) / n of n identical and independent random variables looks like:<p><pre><code>    cm(k) = n c(k / n)
</code></pre>
Now if you know calculus, you know the rest. Taylor-expand around k = 0 to find:<p><pre><code>    cm(k) = i  k  k/2 * (/n)  i k/6 (  / n) + ...
</code></pre>
We see a <i>geometric attenuation</i> in this series, we keep dividing new terms by n. If we drop terms from c'' on we get a constant, M = . That's boring, so we keep one more term, to find:<p><pre><code>   cm(k) ~= i E[X]  (Var[X] / n) k / 2
</code></pre>
This is extra-good if f(x) is symmetric about the mean (so that the skewness vanishes), but it is also pretty good even if the distribution is skewed.<p>We can now invert all of the steps to return back to a probability density: you exponentiate, so you get exp(i  k) exp(- k / 2 n), then you inverse-Fourier-transform, which transforms the exp(i  x) into a frequency offset x  x   and which transforms the Gaussian into another Gaussian, so you get a Gaussian centered at x = .<p>In other words you get approximately a normal distribution with mean E[X] and variance Var[X] / n, with the error given by convolutions of higher-order terms, and the first correction disappearing when the distribution is symmetric about  (or otherwise non-skew).",1369956179

That's too much for some use cases, but certainly acceptable for others (especially with proper caching).<p>Tell that to someone on a mobile device with poor connectivity.<p>> In particular, remember that the Lua VM is often significantly faster than other dynamic languages like Python and Ruby. These languages are useful in many cases even if they are not super-fast.<p>Something people often overlook is that performance is <i>highly</i> dependent on where the code runs. Ruby is fine for server-side programs because you can always go fast by throwing more hardware at it.<p>Languages that run on end-user machines don't have that luxury. This is why the playing field for client-side programming languages is much more constrained and why C++ is still hugely popular there. It's also why so much work has gone into optimizing JavaScript.<p>Being half as fast as JS could be tolerable for some apps, but that means your app will likely be slow and stuttery in some cases. When it is, there's little you can do about it. Is Lua that much of an improvement over JS to justify that?<p>> There are however some tricky issues, for example we can't do cross-VM cycle collection - if a Lua object and a JavaScript object are both not referred to by anything, but do refer to each other, then to be able to free them we would need to be able to traverse the entire heap on both sides, and basically do our own garbage collection in place of the browser's - for normal JavaScript objects, not just a new type of objects like Lua ones.<p>This is a huge deal. It basically means if you use this, your app is very likely to leak memory unless you are <i>very</i> careful. The difficulty of being appropriately careful is exactly why we moved to GC languages in the first place.<p>WebKit (now Blink on the Google side) actually has a similar problem already: WebKit manages memory for the DOM separately from V8's garbage collector. This adds a bunch of complexity to the browser to deal with those cycles and has, I think, a significant performance cost.<p>It's enough of an issue that the Chrome team is starting a new project (""oilpan"") to provide a unified GC shared by both V8 and the DOM.<p>Don't get me wrong, I think this is a very cool hack.

When I first started freelancing, I charged a pretty low rate (~30/hr around SF), and it did get my started (getting great amounts of referrals etc). Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice my code quality b/c the amount of gigs I would work on at once in order to live here, and I noticed that the people who normally book low rate devs are the ones you REALLY don't want to deal with. So I would say never, ever ever charge a rate lower than you think you are worth. It may get you some gigs, but low rate attracts crappy projects/people. The people you generally want to work understands that high rate means better code/happier life in the long term.",1369955101

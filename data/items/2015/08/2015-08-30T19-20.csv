10144310,comment,10143563,10143563,0,0,resu_nimda,,,"This reminds me of a passage from Aldous Huxley&#x27;s essay on mescaline, <i>The Doors of Perception</i>:<p><i>We live together, we act on, and react to, one another; but always and in all circumstances we are
by ourselves. The martyrs go hand in hand into the arena; they are crucified alone. Embraced, the lovers
desperately try to fuse their insulated ecstasies into a single self-transcendence; in vain. By its very
nature every embodied spirit is doomed to suffer and enjoy in solitude. Sensations, feelings, insights,
fancies - all these are private and, except through symbols and at second hand, incommunicable. We
can pool information about experiences, but never the experiences themselves. From family to nation,
every human group is a society of island universes. Most island universes are sufficiently like one another
to Permit of inferential understanding or even of mutual empathy or &quot;feeling into.&quot; Thus, remembering our
own bereavements and humiliations, we can condole with others in analogous circumstances, can put
ourselves (always, of course, in a slightly Pickwickian sense) in their places. But in certain cases
communication between universes is incomplete or even nonexistent. The mind is its own place, and the
Places inhabited by the insane and the exceptionally gifted are so different from the places where
ordinary men and women live, that there is little or no common ground of memory to serve as a basis for
understanding or fellow feeling. Words are uttered, but fail to enlighten. The things and events to which
the symbols refer belong to mutually exclusive realms of experience.</i><p>As thoughts like these have swirled in my head over the years, I have become somewhat obsessed with the question of how my words and actions are interpreted by others, to the point where I often feel like I have no idea what they are thinking. Sometimes I think I have lost some cognitive ability, but others I feel it is just the acknowledgement of the author&#x27;s sentiment &quot;I assume that my mind is a pretty good simulation of yours, and it&#x27;s just not.&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfPerception.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.maps.org/images/pdf/books/HuxleyA1954TheDoorsOfP...</a>",1440964511

For example, a radiation oncologist will tend to discount surgery and will tend to advocate the machines they have access to and experience with.  This is ok, but you need to keep this in mind when deciding treatment.<p>3: Select a care giver who will quarterback.  It is imperative that the patient trust and respect this person.  It is imperative that this doctor understands the patient&#x27;s goals for treatment.<p>4: Have an honest conversation with the relative about how far they are willing to go and what their main goals for treatment are.  What&#x27;s more important: quality of life or a cure?<p>5: Get all legal affairs in order right away, such as a will, medical power of attorney, etc.  Decide on end of life care before you get there.  Assign a trusted person to act when patient is unable to.  Get all paperwork signed, and file a copy with all care givers and institutions.  Make sure the family understands what the game plan is and who will be calling the shots.<p>6: Get a folder and put <i>paper</i> copies of all relevant documents in it, to include legal docs, test results, etc. Always get paper copies of all test results, etc.   Always have this folder with you.  Allow doctors to make copies as needed, but do not give away your only copy of any document.

They appear to me to be personal beliefs which are at odds with my understanding of the development of cartography. So far all you&#x27;ve done is repeat yourself.<p>My hypothesis is that different northern hemisphere civilizations used different conventions to orient the map. For example, the primary convention for Middle Ages Europe was that east is at the top of the map. This is well attested. See not only the links I gave but the following links:<p><a href=""http://www.turkeyinmaps.com/Medieval.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turkeyinmaps.com/Medieval.html</a> shows 8 medieval maps. 1) The
T-O map of Isidore, &quot;east is towards the top of the map, 2) Beatus World Map, &quot;The east is to the top of the map&quot;, 3) World Map of A-Idrisi, &quot;the south is oriented to the top of the map&quot;, 4) Ebstorf Mappamundi
 where the map is &quot;superimposed on a background of the figure of Christ crucified; with His head at the top (East), His feet at the bottom (West) and His hands pointing North and South, <i>an orientation that dominated medieval European cartography</i>&quot; (click on the map for that description; emphasis mine), 5) Hereford Mappamundi, &quot;As previously mentioned, East is at the top of the map&quot;, 6) Vesconte Mappamundi, &quot;circular in format and oriented with East to the top&quot;, 7) Higden World Map, &quot;oriented with East at the top&quot;, and 8) The Catalan Atlas (likely north; the link says it was a portolan chart, &#x27;intended to lie on the chart-table of a ship and always was oriented to the necessities of navigation, thus there is no &#x27;orientation of priority&#x27; of such maps. ... however, as the legends that are legible prevail in north-orientation, in the modern literature of the maps the north-orientation is now adopted.)<p>So that one page shows 6 east-as-top maps, 1 south-as-top, and 1 north-as-top.<p>Another link is <a href=""http://www.medievalists.net/2013/07/28/ten-beautiful-medieval-maps/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medievalists.net/2013/07/28/ten-beautiful-medieva...</a> :  1) Madaba Mosaic Map, which Wikipedia says is &#x27;not oriented northwards, like modern maps, but faces east towards the altar in such a fashion that the position of places on the map coincides with the actual compass directions.&#x27; 2) The T-O Map of Isidore of Seville (east, as already mentioned), 3) Saint Beatus of Liébana (east, as already mentioned), 4) Tabula Rogeriana (which I previously commented was an Arab map with south at the top), 5) Matthew Paris’ map of Great Britain (a regional map, with north at the top), 6) Hereford Mappa Mundi (already mentioned, with east at the top), 7) The Vinland Map (perhaps a forgery; north at the top), 8) The Maps of Piri Reis (another portolan chart with no preferred direction), 9) Carta Marina (north), and 10) The Gallery of Maps in the Vatican, where the image given shows Sicily oriente with south at the top.<p>That&#x27;s 3 north-at-top maps out of 10.<p>So, am I really cherry picking or are you simply incorrect about your understanding of cartographic history?<p>I invite you to show me a list of other medieval European maps where a majority have north at the top.<p>P.S. Your statement that I &#x27;simply grabbed a list called &quot;Early world maps&quot; off of wikipedia&#x27; is provably incorrect. I also listed two maps (the early Western Han Dynasty map and the Psalter map) which are not on the &quot;Early World Maps&quot; page.<p>Feel free to count for yourself the number of pre-Mercator maps on the &#x27;Early world maps&#x27; which use a direction other than north for the top of the map. Your hypothesis is that few if any should have anything other than north at the top, but that&#x27;s easily seen to be incorrect. Observational evidence so far is more in line with my hypothesis.<p>P.P.S. You said &quot; The Nile Begins its flow South of the Equator and flows towards it before emptying in the nearest large body of water, the Mediterranean.&quot; However, 1) water doesn&#x27;t flow to the nearest large body of water but rather it flows downhill, and 2) while the headwaters of the Nile is at 2 degree south latitude, the largest nearby body of water after crossing the equator is the Indian Ocean, approximately 1000km away instead of 5000km.<p>And did the Greeks know where the Nile began? Wikipedia at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile#Search_for_the_source_of_the_Nile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile#Search_for_the_source_of_...</a> says that &quot;no European of antiquity is known to have reached Lake Tana&quot;, which is in Kenya, in the northern hemisphere. Why do you think the Greeks thought that Nile started from below the equator?",1440962852
10144242,comment,10142186,10143995,0,0,mpweiher,,,"While both the coal dust and Chernobyl future deaths are somewhat statistical in nature, there is a huge difference that you would acknowledge if you were <i>sincere</i>.  The coal deaths are already occurring.  They are, as far as I can tell, sufficiently statistically significant that they are not seriously in question.<p>The future Chernobyl deaths are just that:  predictions about what <i>may</i> happen in the future.  They think it could happen, but they don&#x27;t know.  And due to the extremely low level of the signal, it will be very hard to tell if they do occur, because as the WHO report states, other effects such as poverty are much more significant.<p>So, no, the comparison to coal dust is not unfair at all.<p>But, for the sake of argument, let&#x27;s completely ignore the coal dust and other respiratory or global warming effects, and concentrate on just the proven accidents.  Heck, let&#x27;s be super unfair and leave <i>in</i> the estimated possible statistical future deaths from Chernobyl, but only consider the documented deaths from coal accidents.  That gives us 4000 deaths for Chernobyl and 4000-6000 <i>per year</i> for coal.  So even when being totally unfair towards nuclear, it is somewhere between 20-40x safer than coal.<p>When you level the playing field, you have the 50 deaths from Chernobyl and around 131 others, though that includes lots of accidents not related to power generation.  Around 180.  Let&#x27;s double it and call it an even 400.  So 10x fewer deaths than coal.  Except that&#x27;s per year vs. since ever.  So we&#x27;re talking around 500-1000x safer.<p>No matter how you slice and dice the numbers, nuclear power is <i>vastly</i> safer than existing means of power generation, even given the sorry state of the industry today.<p>Of course, we should still be doing as much solar as we can (just be careful when installing!), and we should improve reactor designs so they are even more safe.  For example using the liquid fuel thorium reactors, or concepts such as PIUS, which uses passive mechanisms relying mostly on physical laws to shut down and cool the reactor, rather than active mechanisms that can fail as they did at Fukushima-Daiichi.  And hope that one or more of the multitude of nuclear fusion projects makes a breakthrough.",1440962827

When you crunch the numbers, that gives you a production of ~80 TWh per year from the new coal plants.<p>Now, as the article you linked points out, this has replaced old coal plants being phased out.

What would be really cool is to have chunks of content belong to multiple documents, or being able to copy-n-paste by linking and so forth. Again, nothing that hypertext itself isnt already, just a concrete implementation in an editor context.<p>one more for &quot;when I get to it&quot; :)",1440961610

When possessed by the sense of a long range mission, the slow and steady burn of quiet conviction sustains us through the inevitable lulls and frustration.<p>Experiment with reducing stimulation. Learn mindfulness meditation, which is proven to lessen anxiety. Take some walks in the mountains or nature. Climb trees. I remember when I recently re-discovered pleasure in the simplest things, like the sound of wind moving through trees, or the feel of the green moss beside the forest brook. These things only appear to have lost meaning because we have come to think of them as abstractions, as mere information or symbols, rather than in four dimensions that flow within and through us. The second chapter in Ray Bradbury's ""Dandelion Wine"" captures this well.<p>Take your pen and notebook. Experiment with and appreciate incremental change to habits.  Forgive yourself and others.<p>Until you discover a greater purpose, then your greater purpose IS that process of searching and assimilating...your life already means more immediately the moment you take the decision to get serious about it in this way. And by the way, software engineering is a powerful craft. You can address almost any purpose through it.<p>Listen for these long range signals, and in the end, you'll feel truly satisfied in proportion to your creative generosity to the world.<p>All the best.",1362596156

The results also show how consumer preferences differ country to country.<p>Apple is asking the results of these surveys only be shown to the jury when proceedings begin next week.

I truly believe that the jury is already in and that anyone who is serious about becoming a software professional should write tests for every line of code. I really really believe it and want to use it.<p>That being said, it is so fucking hard to get started with TDD. Oh god, it's so difficult. I've done the katas, done an apprenticeship, read the RSpec book, watched every screencast I could find, everything you can reasonably ask a learning developer to do, and I still find it incredibly impractical to practice TDD when working on most projects, not because I don't want to, but because it's so difficult and time consuming and the resources just aren't there to help make my process quicker.<p>Here's an idea for the TDD crowd. Every time you're about to write a blog post about why people should use TDD, instead write a blog post about a situation where you applied TDD, the tests you wrote and the code it lead to. We need more examples of TDD in progress, more code snippets, more screencasts. I'm telling you the problem is that the resources just aren't there to encourage these habits. Instead of continuing to have this debate at a semantic level, if there were more testing resources available I think people would naturally flock to it and TDD would win out. Until then, I think it's twitter fights and bad habits for the foreseeable future.<p>*This comment applies verbatim to security best practices as well.",1362595291

I think McGinn's point is that human cognition involves creative elements (imagination for example) that don't seem well modelled on pattern recognition, but that doesn't come across that well.<p>McGinn's tirade is not again antropomorphic language per se, it is against homunculism. The idea that a human mind is composed by agents (homunculi) that exhibit mental properties leaves the mental properties of those agents unexplained. That's the reason he proceeds to argue agains the use of ""information processing"", because he seems to find that also explanatorily lacking.<p>> It's similar to his criticism of Kurzweil's ""law"" of accelerating change. Sure, it should be called a theory not a law, big deal.<p>It should be called a generalization, or maybe an hypothesis, it isn't even a theory. McGin's question is: is this generalization valid?

In the meantime, fixing the law so that circumvention-without-infringement is never illegal would still be a great improvement even if we can't be rid of the whole thing immediately.<p>2) There are two relevant parts to DMCA 1201. The first is that circumvention is prohibited. This is the thing the Librarian of Congress currently is allowed to create exemptions for. The second is that circumvention <i>tools</i> are prohibited. The exemptions the Librarian makes apparently don't apply to this -- if we're doing some reform, it really ought to exempt tools with a ""substantial non-infringing use.""

The dashboard is all driven by AngularJS (using $resource/$http api calls). The checkout page is more like Twitter, in that we preload data in the DOM when it's rendered, but there are API calls via AngularJS to create the order, check quantity, etc. These pages are actually served directly from our CDN.<p>As far as how it's worked for us. We've actually rewritten our dashboard and checkout page twice, and it look some getting used to on how to structure our controllers. Getting used to writing directives instead of using jQuery and doing DOM manipulation in our controllers also takes some discipline, because it's just way simpler to drop some selectors and event bindings/triggers in your controller.<p>The way AngularJS encourages you to keep any dom manipulation out of the controller and to think about reusable directives has really helped for readability and maintainability of the code base. We're consistently surprised how quickly we can implement features because of AngularJS. We've actually said, ""Wow, that was easier than I was expecting"" quite a few times.<p>However, there are some hurdles. $http doesn't support file uploads, the stable release doesn't support custom http headers with $resource, only one ngView, etc. That said, I still would not hesitate to recommend AngularJS.",1362594084

Each feed would require a router for termination, and this router is typically using BGP. Since you keep multiple providers having redundant routers on each feed isn't always necessary. But there are cases where I've seen a single feed being served by redundant routers using something like VRRP.

But since the vast majority of startups fail and have no more time (or rather, will) to collect development metrics than they do to implement TDD, I doubt we'll ever have any kind of real validation of this perception.<p>I suspect it comes from a combination of a) young coders more likely to find themselves at a startup, who are also more likely not to have developed TDD habits and 2) VCs, angels and the like who, while well-intentioned, likely push this notion that TDD is for ""mature"" companies and/or, ""we'll pay that off later, just get the code out the door."" Young CEOs, CTOs, founders and the like who need to validate all of their startups' initiatives and practices probably are swimming upstream if they want to go TDD from the ground up.<p>For some instances of prototyping and lightweight apps (like Obie mentioned), this is probably fine. In my experience though, the short term effects of playing ""shipping"" against ""craft/testing"" settle in within a matter of days and weeks, not months and years, and the mid-term effects of technical debt when a startup moves into ""mature"" phase (again, a much shorter time span than anyone realizes) are such that the idea of ""debt"" and ""what are we going to do about it"" becomes a/the dominant conversation on the team. I've experienced both sides.<p>My perspective: the cost of TDD is mainly to young coders who need to learn it and find the curve daunting. Teams built around these type of otherwise talented devs really <i>would</i> incur significant up-front cost to booting up a CI/Test server and getting past the curve to the point where the team is moving at a comfortable pace, comparable to where they were before implementing TDD. In this case, TDD is a very hard sell. I don't know how to solve that problem, other than changing the SV/startup culture to the point where those holding the purse strings see the benefits of craft/testing as being as attainable in the mid-to-short term as they are in the long term (and in my experience, they absolutely are).<p>If you have buy-in to TDD/craft (I can't really separate the two in my mind) from the top-down, and you have experienced coders that can facilitate implementing, in my opinion it's absolutely worth pursuing. The second-order effects of a culture built on these principles kick in with a vengeance <i>right</i> when a startup needs it: at <i>crucial pivot points</i>.<p>When you have to change your business assumptions quickly -- and this usually happens weeks or months into the starup lifecycle -- would you rather do it on a codebase where, say, your authentication/authorization and user model was tightly coupled to other concerns or not? Would you rather know with a relative degree of confidence that the changes you're making are not breaking core concerns? Wouldn't you rather do this <i>quickly</i>, rather than thrash around in unclear code that you'd rather just rewrite (you know, like it felt when we started!)?<p>And if you're pivoting, are you not more likely to be less cash-rich, under more pressure and in need of some really good success right now, since pivoting probably implies that former assumptions did not pan out the way you'd hoped? Isn't that <i>exactly</i> the point where you'd like to both reuse the code you need and know that things are still working around your baseline assumptions that seemed so clear a few short weeks/months ago?<p>I would think at this point the benefits to a startup in this mode, of a clean, fast-moving and validated codebase, of the kind that <i>good</i> TDD tends to produce, should be <i>patently freaking obvious.</i> Just my opinion.",1362593628

It's almost like no developers at Apple use their laptops plugged into a monitor full time. Granted, there's several 3rd party options available, but I hate paying the $10 - $40 for OS-level features that should just work in 2013.  When I have my Macbook hooked up to an external monitor and make an app full-screen, the whole desktop slides off of the second monitor, making a dual monitor setup frustrating.<p>Another thing that mystifies me is the Finder search window, always being global by default.  I've gone into Finder -> Preferences -> Advanced and selected ""Search the Current Folder"", but it still doesn't work properly. Heck, a lot of things about Finder mystify me when I think further about it: like sorting files, folders, copy and moving folders/files around, etc...<p>My local coffee shop changes the wireless password every day.  Ever have to do this on OS X?  Very painful. Open Network Preferences -> Assist Me -> etc..

I've had a lot of issues with it, getting Postgres running natively (though there's now an App to make it easy to install on OS X).  Also, at times I've installed versions of XCode broke everything and found the dev environment very unstable....so I now do almost all this stuff in an Linux-based VM that mimics production servers.  This solves a lot of issues.<p>These things aren't really the end of the world, however I often think that if I'm doing a lot of development in a Linux VM, why not just move back to Windows?  (One reason is that I like Keynote a lot for wire-framing apps.)<p>Note: I noticed someone below knocking on iPhotos.

I mean, does he know for sure that this was a VC motivated initiative?<p>Coincidentally enough, I'm working on a site (howl.com, check the ask HN section) that pretty much exactly the same as what Digg decided to evolve into: more personalized sharing. I don't know Alex, but maybe he just got a bit big headed in assuming what Digg was doing was simply a hack of popular features.<p>In my eyes, I already know the new features together make sense, its something I wanted, thats why I'm building it. It may feel like a bunch of hot functions thrown together, but that doesn't mean it wont be good or give value to users.",1275119772

Despite much experimentation, we are unable to come up with the rules that govern when this will or will not occur.)<p>So apparently these 'user interface experts' have been unable to figure out what I and everybody else I know managed to understand implicitly without any particular effort:  that a long press is a different action to a short press. No wonder they think it is a poor UI - they must be utterly confused all over the place. But honestly, this is a fairly common UI concept in space / button limited devices.   I somehow doubt they are really as 'expert' as they suggest if they haven't come across this before.",1275118924
1388495,comment,1387800,1387800,0,0,mistermann,,,"Wow, awesome so far!<p>Just a few ideas:<p>Add a column for ""Description"" or ""Why this code is important/interesting)<p>Functional Area(s): <math>, <statistics>, <sorting>, etc (rather than just language), ie: method to do: <xxx> Category:<Statistics> , etc. (could get complictaed, but there may be a way to sort it out)
Related to that, an interesting idea (I've seen this elsewhere) is have well-known algorithm <x>, and then have people submit implementations in different languages (and I supose people could upvote the best implementation per language).  For example, there are many different common algorithms known to the world of CS that have been around for years, it would be nice to have a hub where one could go to find these, and be able to see implementations of said algorithm in your language of choice.<p>You might want to implement a bookmark system and advanced search so people could tag things they want to read later, and advanced search would allow to search title, within description, only tagged, etc etc<p>A lot of what you should be doing for a site like this is the same thing stackoverflow has done, yet, it is distinctly different, and useful.<p>This could turn out to be a really great website!  Stackoverflow has kind of explicitly avoided getting really deep down into the source code level, but I think there would be a really huge demand for such a thing if it was done properly, and nice work for 1 day!!<p>I hope you run with it, I think it's a really great idea that will work, if you put enough work into it!!",1275118888

Maybe I write my code a bit slower as I am always thinking about edge cases as I go, but everyone keeps telling me I have to write all these tests, but for what?<p>Is it mostly for the following developers?  I suppose that makes sense.  But then, I've inherited projects where I had to throw 50% of the code away, and all of the tests, because it was hotshot young developers who were hip to all the new things, but couldn't code their way out of a paper bag.<p>I see you point, but I think some sort of a reasonable balance has to be reached here.",1275117219
1388483,comment,1388423,1388423,0,0,_delirium,,,"Advertising rates vary a ton, so it's hard to answer in general. But in many areas you can get much more than the $0.10 per thousand impressions you cite as a breakeven point on bandwidth. It's not unheard-of to get $10-30 per thousand impressions, at which point your bandwidth costs are <= 1% of advertising revenues. I get $20 myself on one site, though it's admittedly low-volume, so it's quite possible it'd go down a lot if the visitors increased beyond the current niche of very relevant users.",1275117043
1388482,comment,1387800,1387800,0,0,abecedarius,,,"What a great project -- I want to shake your hand for making that in a day.<p>There was a similar site once, slickorslack.com, around long enough to show up some biases in the ratings. Most obviously, short cryptic snippets got lots of undeserved love: you could see this because code with great ratings didn't even work. Like, a broken but even shorter version of the Haskell pseudo-quicksort we've all seen handily beat out  the good version. I tested this bias by fixing some other broken or poor submissions, with usually similar results. You can kind of see the same pattern on the new site where the 1/sqrt(x) approximation currently rules -- how many upvoters understand how it works?<p>I'm not sure what to do about this, if anything. Make it easy to run the code? Would help, but does nothing about judging things cool because you don't understand them at all. Deliberately post broken code to keep people on their toes? Eh.<p>This love for the obscure didn't extend all the way to IOCCC obfuscation -- the sweet spot seemed to be dense code apparently written for someone much smarter than you.<p>So I'm tempted to strip out helpful doc comments, even 1- or 2-liners, for the ratings.<p>There was a heavy Ruby bias -- dunno if we'll see any equivalent here.<p>Since slickorslack was an anonymous hotornot-style shootout, there's an opportunity for new biases now, like positive feedback on the visible ratings, or submitter reputation. I'd like to be able to blind that info until I've judged for myself. Maybe view in either reading mode, without vote arrows, or judgment mode, without metadata until you've judged?<p>I think I'd like to be able to fork submissions and offer supposed improvements.",1275116940

Since you have a network of people, they could form such a group, that everyone's individual talents are cancelled out.<p>This is why, I don't believe in complete democracy at work. There has to be a clear leader, who is not afraid to make decisions, to see them through, also is accepted by others to make decisions (in most cases at least), and is someone, who finishes stuff.<p>Last week I read a great way to assemble such a group (at least it sounds like a good way to me). In the book '33 Strategies of War', there was a chapter on how George Marshall, an American military leader trained young proteges, and picked the ones, who were the most like him. After putting these young people to test, he gave them key roles and placed them in key positions. He, then encouraged them to also train their own subordinates.<p>Basically he 'cloned' himself, and then showed his 'clones', how to 'clone' themselves too. Thus he was able to create a new, more efficient group of leaders, without confronting leader with large egos.",1275116766

No matter how much testing you do in the lab, the ultimate test is in the hands of end users. Lots of dumb WIMP UI ideas, like modal dialogs, MDI windows, and nested menu hierarchies, survived the labs at Xerox, Apple, and Microsoft, but fell out of favor over years of real user experience. On the other side of the coin, lots of now-popular desktop and web UI elements were conceived by run-of-the-mill developers far from any research campus. As the new-car smell wears off touch devices, plenty of touch UI conventions will get drop-tested in the wild, the stupid ones will get discarded, and the good ones will get copied by everyone and become taken for granted. This will happen far faster in the cutthroat app marketplace, under the eyes of millions of customers, than in any HCI lab.",1275116501

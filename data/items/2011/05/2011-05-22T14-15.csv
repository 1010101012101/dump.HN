I like the simpler re-structured sentence you've suggested.<p>I'm not offended about the non-native comment - I presume you are trying to say that some of the copy sounds like it's been written by someone who speaks english as a second language? This is interesting because it has been worked on by 3 native english speakers (one of them is also an english lit. graduate!).  Maybe the problem is actually the fact that three people are working on this copy and another problem being that we are all very close to the product.<p>We would like to say more about the type of content - it's not music, so the fact that you think it is, is not good.  It's all spoken word programmes (audio documentaries, interviews, discussions, stories etc.). Does 'spoken word programmes' sound like a good way to explain this type of content?<p>I also agree about the periodical comment.  The fact that we will be pushing you content on a periodical basis is more of a detail for later explanation.  Maybe the word 'regular' sounds better than 'periodical'.",1306076054

I have a US bank account with a boring, not-cutting-edge-in-any-way bank, and I specifically asked for this (and got it) for both my personal & business accounts.  So I suspect it's an option that's available at most banks if you have a decent credit history.<p>I have a 2500 or 3K credit line attached to each account; if I overdraw my balance -- with a bill payment, ATM withdrawal, whatever -- the extra comes from the overdraft line of credit, and there aren't any fees.  I even used to be able to transfer money from the overdraft credit line into my checking account using their online interface, but they've turned that off now.<p>I've never overdrawn for more than a few days (due to poor planning, generally), so it's a perfect safety net... I always hated those fees!<p>It's not quite the same as a normal credit card line, I suppose -- where if I pay off the balance at the next statement, I pay no interest -- but the interest has never been more than pocket change, so I haven't even bothered looking it up.<p>[edit: sorry; I intended to post this in response to a post replying to you, not your post]",1306075406

2573282,comment,2572757,2573009,2,0,hga,,,"To reify this, my favorite example from <i>The Innovator's Dilemma</i>:<p>After WWII hydraulic excavators were introduced to the market.  They could only move a quarter of a cubic yard at a time, the sort of work that had previously been done by men with shovels.  This nicely fit with the explosion of suburbs where these excavators could efficiently dig small trenches for water and sewer access.<p>The steam shovel companies ignored this, catering to their markets for bigger trenches for main water and sewer pipes and larger scale excavation (e.g. digging out foundations).<p>The companies making hydraulic excavators steadily improved, to the points where they could handle the above applications.  At those points they <i>quickly</i> wiped out their entrenched steam shovel competitors, for they didn't have chains that could snap and lash back at the operator.<p>For the general reasons mentioned by the parent posting, these competitors woke up to the threat way too late, didn't have the expertise necessary to quickly compete and I'm pretty sure most/all that tried ran out of money before they could make the transition.  One of the deadly things about disruptive innovation is that they can crater your revenues faster than your corporate culture can respond.<p>ADDED:<p>All that said, after reading the article, while the author does not clearly make the case, I get the feeling that ""Teen Knowledge Work"" <i>as enabled by the Internet</i> is indeed something like a disruptive innovation.<p>The Internet has <i>massively</i> leveraged would be and current ""knowledge workers"".  Let's look at our ability to self-educate: previously, it was hard to be an autodidact if for no other reason than it was hard to find out the books you ought to read.  Now that meta-information is easily available, in on-line course book lists, Amazon.com reviews, Wikipedia articles and of course many less formal venues.<p>With these resources, not a whole lot of cash (and things like  forums where one can questions) the self-directed self-disciplined learner can get a pretty good education.  It won't equal the one you can get from rubbing shoulder with a few thousand of the best and brightest at MIT or an IIT, but I suspect it's enough to start a serious knowledge worker career.<p>So to get back to the disruptive innovation concept, teens who previously (with rare exceptions) just couldn't come up to speed before they exited their teen/early 20s years, who were able to do lower quality ""knowledge work"", are now able to do much higher quality knowledge work.<p>(One detail that you need to take into consideration of all this is how the college degree has replace the now worthless high school degree and now illegal recruiting testing.  And now things like a portfolio of accomplishments presented on the Internet can replace the college degree as a signal.)",1306073799

It turns out it is almost always huge numbers of domestic consumers vs. a very small number of domestic suppliers, and NOT natives vs. foreigners as the suppliers would like us to believe.

Let's cut that in half (~250 sensors) and reduce the frequency to 30 Hz, then we've gone from 825 kbps to 274.5 kbps.  Multiply by 8000 planes, that's 1.8 Gbps aggregate.  With stream compression, a lot less.<p>Challenging? Sure.  But I think even my restatement is too much data. Maybe send data less often if everything is within ""normal operating parameters.""

We know very little about the deep parts of the ocean.<p>The world has had the technology to go there since 1960 when a two man crew in the <i>Trieste</i> went to the Challenger Deep. I think the reason new subs don't have a crew is because it's cost prohibitive. Since the median ocean depth is 1/3rd of the depth... most of these subs aren't engineered for extremes. My guess is the next time a crew goes there it'll be funded by some rich explorer looking for a challenge (Richard Branson, etc).

Takes some capital, but not that much.  EC2 is not competing on price.   I believe few weeks of hacking on a good provisioning system is all that is stopping me from claiming to be a 'cloud computing' provider, in the sense that ec2 is a 'cloud'<p>The ec2 cloud is a lot like traditional dedicated servers, only with a nice provisioning interface.<p>The advantage of that is it's linux;  and there are many providers willing to rent you linux boxes.  you just need to modify your provisioning setup.<p>Now, if you mean 'the cloud' like google's app engine or something else that is a platform that is only offered by one provider, then yeah, I agree.  you never want to be in a position where you are dependent on one supplier.",1244059472

I'm pleased, though, that the article matches my experience.<p>I think zimbabwe has a point that ""the classroom rarely adds more than what students could get in a focused extracurricular group,"" but finding that group would be nearly impossible.  Writing is a very solitary activity, and sharing unfinished work is (for the vast majority) a horrifying experience.  You're not going to easily get those people together to recreate a regular (and good) workshop.<p>The workshop itself was pretty widely reviled by professors and students, and contact we had with writing departments elsewhere showed we weren't alone in that feeling.  But I agree with the final thesis of the article that ""workshops work"".  I'm pretty sure my stories and novel got better throughout, from criticism I received and from the sheer amount of practice I got.  I ended up not writing after getting the degree (programming was more fun), but a few people I graduated with have started making names for themselves, and I feel pretty good about that.  It suggests that maybe I could have if I stuck with it.<p>I sometimes think that a writing workshop could be nicely transferred to programming.  It's been my experience that programmers are much more willing to share and accept advice on unfinished projects, and the little writing games that seem so lame to writers might translate better too.",1244059303

In many cases it's just adds missing methods in old browsers and that's it. And we always keep the original functionality intact.<p>We're trying to balance between the Prototype extensions hell and jQuery agnosticism. Things like String#endsWith, Array#compact is kinda standard features, they are extremely handy in everyday work and most of soberminded programmers won't hack those methods if they create some plugin that other people might use.<p>As the matter of fact most of jQuery plugins don't extend prototype too.<p>So it is a problem, but I believe it's negotiable and there might be a non-polar solution.",1260737861

It doesn't keep the money sitting around to pay me back.  If things go wrong, the biz won't have money to pay me back.<p>Let's compare that with the Wikipedia description of fractional reserve banking. ""The fact that banks are required to keep on hand only a fraction of the funds deposited with them is a function of the banking business. Banks borrow funds from their depositors (those with savings) and in turn lend those funds to the banks’ borrowers (those in need of funds).""<p>Yes, there's the quibble about ""demand deposits"" vs other kinds of loans, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the expansion in the actual money supply.<p>Yes, I know that the article defines ""money supply"" as ""cash plus demand deposits"".  However, as a loan matures, it becomes closer to a ""demand deposit"" and eventually becomes one.  The original money, meanwhile, has already left the biz.  Maybe some came back, maybe it didn't.  Either way, the only thing that's there for sure is the obligation to pay.<p>Note that a bank has loans as assets.  A biz has whatever it got in return for the borrowed money that it spent.

Both are from Peano.  One system is first order and the other is second order.  The second order system is not recursively enumerable.  The first order system is.<p>At the beginning of the 20th century mathematicians were looking for a first order system that would encapsulate all true statements of the second order Peano system.  The reason for this is because a recursively enumerable system is computable.  The second order system is not.<p>Now there is a only one model of the second order Peano axioms (up to isomorphism).  This model is the natural numbers we all know and love.  What Godel showed was that there is no first order system capable of encapsulating all true statements in the integers (the model we all know and love).<p>If you have a statement that can't be disproven then it is true.  A statement is true if and only if there is no counterexample to it in any model of the axiomatic system you are dealing with.  That's what the Completeness result is.  So, if you have a statement for which there is no counterexample in any model then it's true.  This is what the Completeness result is all about.<p>The statement you made:<p>"" It says that in any sufficiently complex axiom system there will be statements that it can neither prove nor refute, ""undecidable"" statements.""<p>is incorrect.  Just take a model and collect all the true statements.  Voila, you have an axiomatic system that is complete.  Do this for any model and you have a complete axiomatic system.

Xenon is a noble gas and therefore volatile, so the reactor will need strenuous containment measures.  Loss of the gas seal would result in significant radioactivity release.<p>Helium-cooled reactors may be constrained by shortages of helium, which is rather rare and difficult to extract on Earth.

993038,comment,992945,992945,0,0,tsiki,,,"Can't be done, and here's why: the 0.25% rate he's referring to is the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks borrow/loan money from/to each other. You don't just ""borrow from the Fed"". Most loans between banks are very short-lived, for example a bank might want to loan money to a major company but doesn't want to wait days or weeks until it has enough in reserves, so it loans the money from another bank. Because the loans are very short-lived and are usually between established banks, they're also very cheap compared to the loans offered to the public. The interest rates of the loans are also negotiated between banks. Now, when you take the fact that, in this case, the borrower would be a complete unknown, and especially the fact that this loan would be for a much longer period than what is usual, 0.25% is impossible. Hell, you could be the Goldman Sachs and be lucky to get under 5% for a 30-year loan.<p>(TL;DR: can't loan that much money with a rate that low for 30 years)",1260734594

It would just get it directly from itself.<p>So I think this is about fractional reserve banking because this is what enables the borrowing/creation of money at below market rates. If a bank had to buy its money on the open market like everybody else, it would have to pay more than what the government pays for money because it's a greater risk. Without a fractional reserve/fiat money/central bank system, a bank would not be able to borrow money at essentially 0% in a credit shortage.",1260734489

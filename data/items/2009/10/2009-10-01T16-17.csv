I've worked for Fortune 250 and 500 companies with cubicle farms and bureaucracy and I've worked for a 2-founder startup with an office overlooking the beach and all glass furniture.  Each had its ups and downs.  Working for the ""Man"" meant I was just a cog in an amorphous machine that always made money no matter what I did.  Working at a frathouse masquerading as a business, I learned a lot and got free beer every Friday.<p>Now I'm working for a company in the middle.  It was a hip startup in 1998 but has now grown up to be profitable.  The older guys are still here, but there is fresh energy too.  The company expanded way beyond its original purpose (remember when Amazon only sold books?  We're like that), and each vertical feels like a small startup sharing space with other startups.  I think it's a good fit for me, but I can't help but think that if I create a startup now, in 10 years I could be the one running a place like this.",1254415978

I'm pretty sure they teach these things in high school or even grade school these days. I'm not suggesting knowing low level details, but understanding the basics of computation - here is this big universe of data out there in secondary storage but I need to grab a part of it into short term memory, do something with it and then stuff it back. It turns out that computation is a fundamental part of our universe (wolfram's a new kind of science and other works talk about this) and there's a lot to be gained by understanding what data is, the different ways it can live and how it is manipulated in modern computers. The CPU/RAM/storage cycle is fundamental and understanding this informs a lot of things. It's also pretty key to learning introductory programming, which I believe impacts basic thought processes in the same way that knowing basic math does.",1254415952

Indeed, skilled people have better long-term memories for domain information, encode domain-related information more efficiently. Similarly, skilled people are able to better deal with distracting tasks while still maintaining their train of thought in the domain-related area.<p>That being said, through the offhand way they impart information, it is clear that they have a significant degree of skill in their domain. (Short lookup times, unaffected by distraction). Moreover, their body language was not urgent or desperate. I have a sneaking suspicion that getting VC is like dating; the needy don't get fed.<p>So my advice to you: spend more time cultivating expertise in your field.

Not dissimilar to the OP case here, they were having ""network issues"" (this was not the reason for my business there, it became a side project), and their LAN was the result of someone who knew some fundamentals but was not a network guy by any means.  I could tell more from 30 seconds of looking at this stuff than what they could ever describe to me (even if they had sent pictures).<p>A network that spans an 18 acre campus could vary from simple to mildly complex.  The terrain and budget could suggest that alternative technologies might be more appropriate (PtP Wifi, Mesh, etc.) for some of the links being served by the fiber.  Perhaps there are aspects of the fiber install that would indicate future potential failures and/or inabilities to recover from those failures.<p>A savvy network guy could assess and communicate this, but if they HAD a savvy network guy, this whole thread would have never existed.<p>So, IMO, an in-person trip is probably the most resourceful way to handle this.  My guess would be a 3-4 day initial session, from which some recommendations could be made.  After that it could be determined if they have the time/skills to implement the recommendations, or if the implementation should also be outsourced as well.",1254414200

No one before has made it up into the canopies of these massive trees. The discovery of reiterations (the growth of new trees and different plant species in the old growth Redwood canopy) has increased interest in old growth timber stands. Furthermore, the proof that the rate of added timber volume increases as Redwoods age will make land owners think twice before harvesting their stands solely for revenue-generating purposes.<p>I believe that with the help of Ken Fisher and the Save the Redwoods League, Sillett and his crew will be able to analyze the last frontier of Redwoods -- the tree's root structure.<p>I'm a third generation California timber land owner, so stuff like this gets me excited.

The way it was explained was that one box serving a ""Free Public WiFi"" prompts other boxes to connect as an ad-hoc network, the original box goes down, leaving any that connected as servers. But in broadcasting the status and info of the network, it would be possible to corrupt the information, essentially mutating what some original server set up as a ""Free Public WiFi"" network to a ""Free Pubic WiFi"" or something.

The main reason for going with ruby was to be able to hire other programmers and get out of the way of coding everything myself.  I assumed 3 years ago when I made the decision that I would eventually be able to hire others.  This has not worked out as planned.  I am still coding everything.  It turns out erlang has taken off enough that it may be reasonable to do a new project in erlang.  I'm still not a fan of using erlang for writing view templates, but choices for this have improved greatly as well.  When viewing the erlang vs. ruby programmer talent pool, there is a gut feel that the erlang pool may have a higher quality ratio although its a much smaller pool.<p>I can tell you that although merb is a nice framework, I still end up digging through code at times to find bugs that would be much easier to spot if it were in erlang.",1254413488

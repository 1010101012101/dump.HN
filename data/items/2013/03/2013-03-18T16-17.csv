Google started adding point to point video and audio calls which is a hack that doesn't work well when you want to incorporate video/audio conference, route calls to the PSTN (E.164) dialing, provide calling features (transfer, call forwarding, call waiting, find me / follow me).  That is why there is SIP.  Google has acquired SIP providers and I understand that their Hangouts backend supports SIP, so I do think they were going to introduce this capability to their environment, but I hope that they are going to stick to an industry standard here as it allows people to choose the endpoint that best meets their need.

You can be charged of things you cannot be simultaneously convicted of.
You can be <i>convicted</i> of anything that is not a lesser included offense of something else.<p>IE you could be charged with manslaughter and murder of the same person, but not convicted of both, because manslaughter is a lesser included offense of murder.<p>As for the federal sentencing guidelines, they were created to standardize what was previously a complete crapshoot. Rightly or wrongly, they were at least based on real data.<p>They give guideline ranges based on an offense level and criminal history.<p>The offense level is determined based on the crime plus any enhancements.
So yes, you may start out at offense level 23 for murder, and then add 4 more levels because you used an illegally acquire weapon to do it.<p>However, this is still the sentence for <i>murder</i>, not for the illegally acquired weapon (and note that if the illegally acquired weapon is used as a sentence enhancement, the facts must be proven to the jury)",1363625862

Statements like ""get some rest and drink some fluids"" must be backed up by evidence to be considered EBM, and there have been cases where that very statement was proven false.<p>In medicine there are also assertions and predictions based on theory instead of direct evidence, lest we be hamstrung by cases not specifically studied. Conventional medicine has an advantage here, because the many theories it collectively adopts on the human ecosystem (physiology, biochemistry, germs, and others) are generally backed by scientifically rigorous studies. This leads to a model that is very well described, often down to the molecular level, and correlates well with other branches of science. This makes its assertions a lot more plausible, if only indirectly evidence-based. Compare that with the theories of the schools of CAM, many of which are based on nothing but tradition, with many others already having been debunked. This lack of plausibility plays a part in limiting the resources available for CAM research, and is the cause of the general sense of incredulity at the CAM community's claims by the scientifically literate.<p>This relates to the OP, where a theory poorly backed-up by evidence is used to create a large body of assertions, leading to doubt and incredulity over its claims.",1363623898

It turns out, we know that you are low on disk space, and will reduce our usage accordingly. Its pretty likely that Firefox keeps better track of this than humans do.<p>No.  Here's a case where Firefox will definitely <i>not</i> do a better job: an NFS-based computer lab environment where users have individual quotas - the statfs() syscall (i.e. what the `df` command uses) returns you the amount of disk space available to <i>everyone</i>, which is enormous.  Firefox then attempts to use that space, and quickly exhausts the user's quota.  This is a real-life scenario and the current solution among users is to set the cache size to 0 - the Internet connection is damn fast anyways and they'd rather use their space to store actual files.<p>For the love of god, what is wrong with having an Advanced options panel?

IMHO it can be accomplished with the correct structure. The problem you identify is that subreddits are shared spaces, and the primary signal that they rely on is the sum of all users. As subreddits grow, the signal becomes worse. Weighting the votes of users could help, but then you are implementing a moderator bias, and not being honest with people about their input would almost certainly lead to blowback.<p>One of our goals with <a href=""http://hubski.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hubski.com</a> was to avoid this problem. Our approach was to avoid shared pages, and instead allow users to build a feed by following other users or tags. That way we don't have the problem of 'keeping bad content out' to begin with. Instead of voting a story up a page, users share the post with those users that follow them. Posts propagate from user to user. Therefore content cannot be 'buried' by competing with other posts in a shared space. Of course, we are not anywhere near the size of Reddit, but it has been working well so far for us.

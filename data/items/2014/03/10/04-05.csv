7371335,comment,7367027,7370217,2,0,enraged_camel,,,">> What Anglo countries had, and have, are very sophisticated legal systems and legalistic societies that leverage the legal system for more purposes. It&#x27;s one thing for a farmer to be able to sue someone who takes his land. It&#x27;s another for farmers to be able to hedge against bad harvests by entering into contracts and having the contracts traded as property rights on derivatives exchanges.<p>I think of a country&#x27;s legal system as a computer program. Anglo countries have been developing their program for a long time. Therefore, it can do a ton of different things, including allowing farmers to hedge against bad harvests in the manner you describe.<p>One problem is that, as programs get more sophisticated, they also become slower, and you end up needing to throw more resources at them to make them run at acceptable performance. This becomes an issue when not every user can afford those resources: what you end up with is some people running the program at state-of-the-art hardware (i.e. rich people who can afford expensive legal representation), and others running it on decades-old hardware (i.e. public defenders). When these groups are pitted against each other (e.g. in a lawsuit), one group dominates, either by using the threat of litigation to force the other side to do something or by winning the trial.<p>Complexity in programs also cause other problems. For example, as a program gets more complex, it becomes harder to maintain and debug. If you write new code, you have to make sure it won&#x27;t conflict with any of the old functionality. It becomes harder to test, harder to bring new people up to speed, and harder to train users because there&#x27;s just so much the program can do. The problem is that, while you can refactor a program&#x27;s code, you can&#x27;t necessarily refactor the legal system: it just gets more and more complex, with no end in sight.<p>>>And complaining that legal contracts are written in &quot;bizarre, arcane language&quot; seems to me to be like a high level manager complaining about programs being written in C++ or Javascript, instead of plain spoken English. After all, why do you need so many lines of this &quot;code&quot; when he just explained precisely everything the program should do in 15 minutes?<p>Programs are written in programming languages because that&#x27;s what computers understand. If you wrote the program in plain spoken English, it would not run. However, <i>user documentation</i> of the program <i>is</i> written in plain spoken English because that&#x27;s what the user speaks. The phrase, &quot;To create a new account, click the &#x27;Register&#x27; button,&quot; does not require the user to hire a specialized, highly-paid professional who will interpret it for him.<p>The law is like, or should be like, user documentation, because it is ultimately consumed by humans. Therefore it makes sense to write it in a language that most humans will understand. Right now though, it is written in the equivalent of a programming language, which is why we need lawyers to make it understandable. It really is ridiculous, if you think about it.",1394426956

But there are plenty of other games out there and games for every consumer, free to play, premium, etc. In most free to play games most people pay less than premium games, it allows games to reach the people.<p>The thing about the current free to play market is some do it well like Valve, Halfbrick etc that add to the fun of the game usually through customization and vanity additions, but others it is part of the game design and much like social games where it is metrics over gameplay. It just serves another consumer, even if that doesn&#x27;t interest old school lots of content and pay up front gamers.<p>Done well, in a way it is a return to the Arcade but much more cool in that you can customize the game and get more from it with additions, which do cost time/money to produce. Games also want you to play for a long time now, or many times in small increments, where before arcade games were made harder to skimp on content and get more quarters.<p><a href=""http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5386788/when-was-the-most-expensive-time-to-be-a-gamer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/6/5386788/when-was-the-most-ex...</a>",1394426750

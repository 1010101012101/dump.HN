So if this happens every time your functions are called, it's unnecessary work, even if it's fast.<p>I personally tend to do all imports in one place, with the exception of test routines: I figure that a user of a module shouldn't really ""depend"" on modules that are only needed in test mode, so e.g. I would do a local ""import"" inside a _test() function.",1245013056

True, much of the money in the area comes from businesses that are somehow attached to computer hardware or software, but within that sector, there's an incredible amount of variety in terms of tools, technologies, and client base.<p>Detroit is failing not just because its economy was driven by the automotive industry -- it was also dependent on a small number of employers (basically the Big Three automakers) who failed to compete with more agile, innovative foreign competitors.<p>There are certainly bigger players in the SV/Bay area whose disappearance would be felt painfully (Google, Apple, Oracle, etc.), but the business culture in the area also seems fairly able to turn collapses (SGI, AltaVista, Netscape, Sun) into opportunities, or at least mitigate the damage done.",1245012432

The latter work especially well when you target a specific domain (such as HTML) and will often be implemented in regexps. Writing one's own regexps are for when you actually need a small custom state machine. Many problems are too small or too large to justify the effort.",1245012333
657528,story,,,16,18,skullsplitter,"Ask YC: Best practice for Python module imports?",,"Im torn between two general module import styles. The import-everything-at-the-top approach where the beginning of each python file/module imports every module potentially needed later in the file OR the import-as-needed approach.<p>I know what I dont like; a file starting w/ 20+ import lines, that just seems ugly and java-y (no-flame, just sayin) to me. OTOH, the as-needed-approach seems perhaps a little too, uhm, disorganized?

I was in a group of advanced students in my junior high school (we took classes like algebra and Spanish two years before our peers), and I took a few AP classes in high school, so I suppose I wasn't the average high school student.<p>The explanation of why there was so much homework:  In K-5 I had only one teacher each year who taught all the subjects (math, English, history, etc.), and I received just 1 or 2 hours of homework a night.  When I entered sixth grade, I suddenly had a different teacher for each subject, each of whom sent me home with an hour or so of homework for each subject.<p>Keep in mind that I'm trying to average the number of hours I spent per school night.  I might have had one night a week where I had very little homework, but once I was in high school, I would spend two or three nights a week up till 1 or 2 in the morning finishing an English essay or work for some other subject.<p>I think I can honestly say that I wasn't aiming for any university education in sixth grade ;-)  I never had any ambition to go to a prestigious university; I only applied to one state school my senior year which I wound up attending.<p>I guess I just had a lot of tough teachers.",1245010260

Boston and NYC both are incredibly prosperous and have well-diversified economies.<p>I think it's more that diversified, healthy economies take <i>time</i> to grow, and you'll never get the sort of fast growth rates that Detroit or San Jose have had in a diversified economy.  Boston and NYC have both been around for close to 400 years; they've had industries rise and fall, which gives them a broad base to fall back upon when the latest industry du jour dies.  Boston had a problem much like Detroit in the 1930s-50s when the textile & tanning industries moved south, but it also had grown strengths in education and finance (dating back to the 1600s) that served as the backbone for the tech & biotech revolutions of the 1970s an 1990s.<p>An interesting comparison might be with Salem, MA, which at the time of the revolution was the 6th largest city in America.  Salem's growth was much more concentrated in shipping that neighboring Boston.  So when technological development replaced sailing ships with steamships, which needed a deeper harbor than Salem could provide, the city declined until it was a mere suburb of Boston.",1245010198

If you need mathematics for your career, why not take a school specialized in making engineers out of you?<p>Two words: <i>premature optimization.</i> Why should everybody have to decide, in their early teens, what career they're going to be doing for the rest of their lives?<p>> The smartest scientist in the world probably don't need English Literature 101. English literature is probably the scientist know, but is it revelant to his career? No.<p>Same deal. I'm no fan of English Literature classes -- I'd prefer a comfortable chair and a good book of my own choosing -- but language skills are important, and forcing people to specialize too early has its own downsides.<p>Incidentally, most math education <i>also</i> counts as premature optimization, where they spend ungodly amounts of time memorizing the procedures for each type of problem in the curriculum. Sure, you'll be able to find X quickly -- but can you actually apply this knowledge? For most people the answer is no.

2889957,comment,2888370,2889650,3,0,grellas,,,"The members in an LLC can take W-2 compensation just as owners of any other entity can be employed by that entity and take salary, etc. There are no special restrictions on this, at least that I am aware of.<p>If early-stage LLCs want to adopt equity incentives, they can mimic what a corporation does with a little custom drafting to the operating agreement. Instead of defining ownership in terms of percentage ownership as set forth in a schedule (the typical LLC pattern), LLC owners who want to issue equity to employees can define the ownership in terms of ""units"" of ownership. They define a number of authorized units in an operating agreement (e.g., 10M units) and then reserve a grouping of them for an equity incentive pool. These can then be used to support unit option grants (like stock options, albeit always NQO and never ISO) or restricted unit grants (akin to restricted stock grants in a corporation). If this is all done in the early stage, the units can be priced at nominal pricing so as to avoid adverse tax consequences to the employees. There is still the problem of option holders being taxed on the spread on the date of exercise (as with NQO options in a corporation) but, otherwise, such grants may be made very much as they would be in a corporation (made subject to vesting, etc.).<p>The key to an effective plan is to do this early in the LLC's existence and, if done in that way, this is pretty comparable to what happens with a corporation (except for the absence of ISO-like options). As long as this is all done right, there are no special restrictions on issuing equity incentives to employees in an LLC.<p>LLCs are state-specific and it might be that there are special restrictions in Illinois or other states that don't exist in California where I practice. But the above sums up the essence of how it is done here.",1313470483

And for the record, I think that their plan for this 5% is much less deceptive than options in an S-Corp can be.<p>The disparity for me is that Jason makes this claim, ""And since we have no intention of selling 37signals or going public  the two scenarios where options/equity really make sense  the complexity became too hard to justify.""<p>My claim is that <i>that statement</i> is disingenuous because it posits the following argument; The company will never be sold, thus options or equity would never be liquidated, so providing equity or options doesn't make sense. The implicit claim on which this argument rests is that they will <i>never</i> sell the company, and that claim is neither supported by a structural contingency on the company, nor supported by a statistical comparison with the ways in which LLCs are dissolved (granted medical practices and law practices seem to dominate in this area, and can skew the results). In my opinion, it deceptively leaves that impression rather than being 'up front' about what are the real constraints.<p>I would completely believe him if he said instead ""The Articles of Organization for the LLC specify exactly how any proceeds from the sale or dissolution of this company are to be distributed, and we are loathe to change them. Thus we don't really have an option here."" (no pun intended)<p>And again, I think its <i>really impressive</i> that they came up with a way to share 5% of the proceeds when the company is sold. I merely suggested some ways they could make it 'look more' like what other people get in terms of equity and options by both allowing people to keep accumulated time after leaving the company and by having those 'units' represent a similarly sized chunk of the company.",1313470153

Also, the CEO and Founder of the startup I work for, Smarterer, is female. We're right here in Boston and were recently funded by Google Ventures. There are more examples for sure, but you get the idea.<p>I understand that there are tradeoffs to be made between getting the hottest and most famous speakers, and getting a variety of perspectives. Kresge has 1,200 seats, and you want - need, even - to fill all of them. That said, the echo chamber that is Silicon Valley does have a habit of amplifying the male voice over the female voice.

You could raise the rates and have people move their money in such a way as to not pay any more at all. From Buffett's position, simply talking about rates, this would be an acceptable outcome.<p>He said that a rich individuals' total tax burden, by percentage of all income, should be brought more in line with what the middle class pays.  I am reasonably sure you're being purposefully obtuse here.  The only way for a person to ""move their money in such a way as to not pay any more at all"", and still meet Buffett's criteria is to make less money, on purpose.",1313467587

If Google can use Motorola's patents to balance the power in patent suits and avoid $20/device in licensing fees... well, they're activating 550k devices per day, so that's $11M/day in savings. Roughly 3 years to break-even on that basis alone.<p>Google can use Motorola to force the issues that have plagued Android for a while. Motorola devices will probably become ""pure Android"" devices like the Nexus series, pushing carriers to abandon the crapware and carrier-specific UIs they're infatuated with.<p>Most people I know with Motorola Android devices say the build quality is for crap. I hope Google can improve this, but if not, I hope they can at least get the carriers to quit layering garbage on HTC's nice hardware.",1313467476

I won't say I'm fluent in c++, but thats mainly due to not having to use it daily. That and I prefer straight c normally, I tend to dig into kernel source and drivers often so c++ isn't a big deal most times.<p>But don't let language preferences of anyone guide you, evaluate what works best and use it for your problems. I like ruby in general but sometimes python is a better choice, other times perl, other times c, or even shell. Don't optimize code you haven't written yet. Explore the domain with ruby if you want and write a faster version in c once you understand the problem. Or java or whatever.",1313467339

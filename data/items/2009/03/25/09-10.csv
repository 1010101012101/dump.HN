I am an engineer, not an historian, but if I remember right, the ones who came to America were the starved, and the persecuted. If you were an aristocrat in England or the Netherlands in the 16th, 17th or 18th century, why would you bother to risk your pleasant life of luxury and debauchery to cross the Atlantic in a fragile vessel?",1237974279

531641,comment,530835,530835,0,0,pavlov,,,"The license situation with this game is interesting. Carmack based this new port on an updated ""Redux"" version of his original codebase which is under GPL, so the resulting iPhone game is under GPL as well. But the iPhone user cannot benefit from the free license: although the source is available, it's not possible to install a freshly compiled version of the game on the device.<p>I suppose that someone could submit a free version of the app to the App Store, but Apple would probably reject it as a duplicate. (I'm not sure if Wolf3D includes artwork or other external assets that are not GPL'd. If so, then a free version would have to provide replacements for those assets, which would essentially make it a different game.)<p>Here's a question which I would love to have answered: does the ""anti-tivoization clause"" in version 3 of the GPL prevent the distribution of a GPLv3 application on an iPhone-style closed platform? Or is ""tivoization"" strictly limited to code that's shipped with hardware?",1237972292

I met people who'd gone to fairly decent high schools who were taking what was basically remedial math, and plenty more people who didn't really seem that interested in their classes or majors. I had a reaction similar to the OP when I saw that kid had a 1300. I knew plenty of smart, motivated people with better test scores who they could have still drawn a very diverse class from.",1237971896

531631,comment,530844,530844,0,0,zasz,,,"It sucks that he had to live in his Jeep, but--Stanford has a lot of work-study positions reserved especially for students like him. He can earn $12-$14 an hour shelving books and spend half the time studying. He could do research in sociology and get room, board, and a little money left over during the summer when he's not getting sizable fellowships from the Haas Center. In fact, if he did research, he wouldn't have to lose any housing at all! If he's still not able to find housing for two weeks, something's wrong with his money management ability or ability to seize the plentiful opportunities Stanford gives him on top of his free tuition, room, and board.<p>It sucks that he feels like a fish out of water, but come <i>on</i>--imagine how much worse it is for an international student. I knew a kid in my freshman dorm who had never seen a pumpkin before, didn't know what the hell it was. It's equally bad for someone who was an introvert, chronically shy, dumped into a dorm full of loud parties where someone was always going to the ER every weekend because they'd drunk too much. He has it pretty good, and I believe that Stanford has done the most it can at this point.<p>I'm slightly shocked that he also says he's moving to a poorer part of the country to get away from all us rich kids. Nobody I've ever met at Stanford has shown any disrespect or distaste for poor students. One of the most popular staff members in my co-op's getting the whole free ride from Stanford, plus tons of work-study opportunities. It's very sad that he's leaving because of some insecurity that's only in his own head.",1237971689

We already have very crude 3-D printers.  Eventually we'll have 3-D ""photocopiers"".  Imagine what will happen to, say, the luxury goods market then, when you can say to your friend, ""can I copy your Rolex""?",1215500167

239631,comment,239429,239429,0,0,bouncingsoul,,,"Some of these are stupid (“Never use italics,” “Use text-transform to capitalize headers and section titles”)†, wrong (“Use list-style-type:decimal in the style sheet instead of changing UL to OL in the HTML to number list items”), and pretty wrong (“Use percentages instead of px for cross browser consistency”), but there's good stuff here.<p>Though I’d appreciate a note about what browser bug a particular workaround is for.<p>† The italics rule I'd guess is to avoid the IE6 float bug, but there better workarounds than axing italics. The suggestion for capitalization is wrong because text-transform:capitalize is very basic and simply capitalizes every word, which is incorrect for titling.",1215497775

239626,comment,239460,239460,0,0,DenisM,,,"<p><pre><code>  Remember that the very first thing you do, when looking
  at any bug, before you even start thinking about it, and
  long before you look at your code, is replicate it. You
  can't debug what you can't replicate, and user reports
  are usually lacking in some details that your trained eye
  will catch.

So if you don't have a repro, you don't investigate the bug? Not a good way to treat your customers.",1215497453

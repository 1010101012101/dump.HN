We had some trash we took out to the dumpster, and we saw a desktop tower. It had a bit of dried mud on it, so it was probably there no more than a few hours.<p>I take it in, and I put it in the &#x27;dedicated desktop testing area&#x27; (read: wherever there was a keyboard/mouse/monitor). I was expecting some massive dead machine. Nope. there was a 80GB hard drive, cd/dvd, RAM, CPU.. Everything was there, and it boot right into WinXP.<p>Then the ohshit factor came into play. On the desktop there were icons for &quot;Anthem Insurance Quoter&quot;, &quot;Blue Cross Quotes&quot;.... and Client List.xls.pdf . That list alone had 500 names, SSN, DOB, address, and phone numbers. And there even more files with more identities as well. So, what do I do? Oh, and I also found the agent&#x27;s name along with his license number. Nifty. He googles to about 2.5 miles away.<p>So.. is this a discarded machine, or was this a drop site after a theft? I don&#x27;t know, and powering it up didn&#x27;t tell me. There wasn&#x27;t any security on the machine at all, so anybody could have plugged in a USB storage and copied without fear of logs.<p>I took it to the police. That&#x27;s not because of the hardware, but because they can alert the users on this machine of possible identity theft and take appropriate steps.<p>(Yes, I do know where on Tor to sell identities like this.

6543174,comment,6542211,6542211,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Pop creativity is midlife crisis creativity of established people. It requires no sacrifice, no travel into uncomfortable places. Instead, it&#x27;s rooted in the worldview that an upper-middle-class &quot;BoBo&quot; can achieve true creativity just by being more of what he or she is. Just be the same thing, with more energy, more self-esteem, and that creativity you had in college and lost (a little each day) paying dues and climbing the corporate ladder can come back-- and, what&#x27;s more, without any concessions on income, social status, or the ability to get ones&#x27; children into elite schools. That never happens. Use it or lose it. If you keep growing that creativity, day by day, you&#x27;ll be at your peak in your 40s and 50s. (You might be obscure and poor, but you&#x27;ll be creative.) If you let it go in early adulthood, though, you never get it back. That&#x27;s just how it works.<p>The dark side of pop creativity is that it allows these deflated, managerial sorts to believe otherwise-- that creativity can come without sacrifice and opposition, that they can &quot;have it all&quot;. It allows them to ignore the truth of their lives, which is that they made a trade they can&#x27;t reverse. If you want to accomplish anything creatively, you have to have an extreme tolerance of social disapproval that less than 1% of people have, and you have that when you&#x27;re young and before you&#x27;re established. For people to continue to grow creatively, their 40s to 60s are their prime; but for the ones who lose that spark, 45+ (after two decades of long work hours and social climbing) is too late to get it back.",1381683069

Of course there are other galaxies too, but I think those 3 dominate currently.<p>For C libraries you can use Pharo. Pharo has inherited 2 FFIs from Squeak and has implemented 1 additional FFI called Nativeboost which also allows you to inline assembly code for best performance. There is also the extra option of making VM plugin with smalltalk or C code which in turn interface with C libraries.<p>For Java there is redline smalltalk, but it does not come with the IDE. It can use Java libraries out of the box.<p>And for Javascript there is amber, it comes with the smalltalk IDE but its still a WIP, so its not as extensive as pharo. It can use javascript libraries out of the box.<p>Smalltalk is a chameleon , its a language and an IDE made to fit in any case scenario. I think you will have a real hard time proving that its tool best used for specific scenarios, even in cases where OO approach is ideal, smalltalk approach could be ideal because it still has one of the most powerful OO systems plus refactoring tools, plus IDE, plus many nice toys.<p>Smalltalk is that extremely rare case of software that it makes coding just flow, with no interruptions and no small annoyances. We call this style of coding &quot;Live Coding&quot; and its definetly the biggest reason to try smalltalk and even more try Pharo.<p>Give a try and register in our mailing list, you will find many people passionate about smalltalk and yet a very welcome atmosphere for beginners.<p>I am also a recent convert to Pharo from Python. I love Python but I dont miss it. So far Pharo has been very productive , fun and eye opening experience.<p>You can find more info here -> <a href=""http://www.pharo-project.org/home"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pharo-project.org/home</a><p>also a forum for the mailing list can be found here -> <a href=""http://forum.world.st/Pharo-Smalltalk-Developers-f1294837.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.world.st/Pharo-Smalltalk-Developers-f1294837.ht...</a>",1381682692

On the other hand if library implementation #7 of a base64 decoder doesn&#x27;t work or you hate it, try ten other implementations or write your own, its just one small-ish function not a giant overbearing framework.<p>Finally don&#x27;t throw out the baby with the bathwater.  If the syntactic sugar of MVC design works for your app, run with it.  You don&#x27;t need a framework to tell you how to design to split your views and controllers and models.

It generates spuriously precise results that garner false confidence, and probably crowds out other, more valid instruments.<p>Your left- / right-handed analogy is not appropriate.  The population is strongly clustered in terms of hand-dominance: most people clearly favour one hand over another.  For the kinds of personality traits the MTBI measures, the distribution is roughly bell-shaped: most people cluster towards the middle.<p>This bell-shape means that a simple binary classification is just about the worst way to do things.  Take the I/E axis.  Most psychologists will tell you that there is an intro- / extraversion continuum, and only a few people are found at the extremes.  A statistician will add that, because of the wide error bands (which we can measure by checking the correlation of the results from, say, the even-numbered with the odd-numbered questions) the MTBI can only reliably identify the extreme types.  For the majority of people who are close to the I/E borderline, the results of the test are basically random.<p>So if my MTBI tells me that I&#x27;m an &quot;I&quot;, all I really know is that I&#x27;m not an extreme &quot;E&quot;.  That isn&#x27;t very helpful.<p>You mentioned having the larger dataset at our disposal.  With the larger dataset, we don&#x27;t need the MTBI.  Without it, the MTBI tells us very little.

Firefox and Chrom{e,ium} will be left out in the cold, and the advancement of the open web will se a significant setback.<p>First thing, Chrome is a proprietary browser platform. Only Chromium should be in the last sentence. I believe Chrome already ships with EME; I am not sure if that includes Google&#x27;s DRM plugin for it as well, but if not then that is soon to come as well. Chrome already ships with various other proprietary code (Flash, SwiftShader, a PDF reader, etc.) so this would not be a new thing.<p>Google and Microsoft have been developing proprietary DRM plugins, with Netflix and Hollywood, for their browsers. EME is just a generic API to those plugins. So your comparison of what will happen with vs. without EME appears flawed: in both cases, only proprietary browsers that include DRM plugins, which are the result of private collaboration with Netflix and Hollywood, will be able to access content. And yes, that would leave out open source browsers like Firefox and Chromium - with or without EME.<p>I also disagree with the premise underlying<p>> The basic position of EME opponents appears to be that if we refuse to allow DRM modules in browsers, then the companies pushing DRM will give up and let us watch unrestricted video. This position, in my opinion, is fantastically optimistic.<p>I agree to the conclusion - that it is highly optimistic to see Hollywood quickly move to unrestricted video. But you are assuming there is no other option. There are in fact several:<p>1. Watermarking as an alternative to DRM, that achieves similar results.<p>2. Non-proprietary DRM solutions, either standardized (which EME does nothing for, intentionally) or done in web content (HTML5). Those would not be as secure as proprietary binary blobs (what EME assumes), but could still prevent 99% of casual piracy - and professional piracy isn&#x27;t stopped even by the blobs.<p>3.

By standardizing it into the browser, you only need to crack a single thing - the browser DRM module - and then you will have free and unrestricted access to all of the DRM content with no additional work.<p>It&#x27;s the same way PS2 piracy was so rampant. You only needed to install a simple mod chip into your PS2, and since all of the DRM relied on that, you could now run every game with no additional work. It created something of a golden age for gaming piracy and the PS2 actually remains popular today in certain regions because of it.<p>So standardizing DRM into the browser is a huge boon for pirates, and a problem waiting to happen for everyone else. The stupidity is sometimes mind-blowing.",1381680622

I agree. The difficulty with this is in the long term. Things change: new opportunities, new technologies, new developers, new functionality.

2140840,comment,2140354,2140813,0,0,shawnps,,,"I'd like to, but I feel like I've exhausted my options.  I've interviewed all over the place, and I'm generally a nice guy and I think I'm pretty smart, but people seem to never want to hire me, I dunno why.<p>I forgot to add this: the most recent interview that was discouraging was with a large travel-related company.  A recruiter reached out to me (so, I didn't even apply), gave me a few questions to complete that I spent hours on.  I worked super hard, typeset it in LaTeX, and figured it was way beyond what they normally receive from candidates.  The recruiter even told me they were very impressed.  I went in to interview, chatted with some engineers (and I even taught the second guy a few things, like the rename command), and never heard back.  I emailed the recruiter and asked why.  The recruiter said that the team simply needed to hire a senior candidate.  I felt stupid for wasting my time.<p>Something similar happened with Jane Street; they wanted solutions to questions in OCaml.  I spent a long time on the problems, submitted them in Scheme, Python, and OCaml, all using recursion, higher order functions, etc.  After submitting the code, they turned me down.<p>Yelp also turned me down after I spent a long time on the problem they gave me.  I did what the problem asked, including writing unit tests.  It was fun to write since it was in Python, and I like Python.  But again, turned down after submitting the code.<p>Also, I figured it wasn't a problem with the code, as I had friends who were hired by Amazon and Google review it and they said it looked fine.<p>These are the types of things that are making me want to stop interviewing.<p>What I'd like to do is become more active in the HN community, and eventually start working on projects related to studying Japanese or learning about Japan.  I'm working on a small project now that will show a new Chinese character per day, because kanji-a-day.com is currently the top result in Google for ""kanji of the day"", and it's not nice looking.",1295989187

When the set of four contacts are flipped over on top of themselves their order will be reversed and that leads to a potential for a short.

Since the surface they are mounted on slides, it could potentially also wiggle up and down.  Careful engineering would be required to ensure these don't come into contact, which would make a nice little short to blow out one of your USB ports.<p>I would consider putting a sliding plate between the two contact plates to keep the two sides separated.

Getting USB HS to work right at the maximum allowed cable length is no BS as-is.  The diagrams aren't clear enough to show exactly where the two contact layers are or how they're connected, but two divided sets of contacts can kill your SI in a hurry.<p>As an aside: why, oh why, didn't they make the USB A connector obviously keyed?  I'd estimate many lifetimes have collectively been spent trying to shove in perfectly rectangular connectors the wrong way.  It should be shaped like a house (a thinner version of the B connector amenable to thin devices) or an arrowhead or something.",1295988297

I went looking for tools and found Omnigraph Sketcher...which looks absolutely perfect, but which only runs on Mac. I think it's well worth $30, but not worth buying a new computer for! Astonishingly, there doesn't seem to be anything like it on the web or for Windows. Any suggestions?<p>What it does: http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnigraphsketcher/ This might look like something that could be achieved in many other ways, which is partly true, but I'll briefly explain why they're less than ideal (hopefully this saves someone else the trouble).<p>Spreadsheet: you could put in numbers and graph them. But often you just want to explore the conceptual possibilities with a diagram, rather than tie it to any particular numbers. Alternatively, you might want to draw a diagram and specify one point on an axis as being equal to a particular number in order to <i>discover</i> what the other numbers would be.<p>Drawing programs: Something like Visio or Google docs can make lots of spiffy diagrams, but they're not much good at measuring angles/lengths/geometrical quantities. Pro illustration programs are better, but it's quite difficult to turn the metrics into content on the diagram or export them.<p>Graphing calculator/math software: a great deal of economic analysis resembles plotting functions against each other and integrating over the results. But it only resembles it, and overconfident application of math wizardry can turn out to be misleading (see: financial crisis of 2008 for an example...). More to the point, you don't know what your functions are ahead of time, and often there's way more software overhead than you would ever want or need.",1295987994

2140612,comment,2139028,2139028,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Sometimes a full rewrite is useful and necessary, often it isn't.<p>The typical failure scenario for rewrites is that development teams don't appreciate that they are more difficult than writing something from scratch. When you create something new you have time for it to grow to scale, you have time for bugs and design defects to be worked out of the system, you have the ability to concentrate on all of these problems without distraction, and the consequences of a late project (which should be expected) are less.<p>A naive rewrite will ignore the fact that the rewrite will take more time to reach the QA level of the old system (especially at scale), that it'll take more time to develop because resources are split between supporting the old system and the new, that it'll be more difficult to support backwards compatibility or data migration, and that it'll be risky to deploy (you either do so incrementally or you take a huge risk and do a big-bang deployment). Combined with the regular schedule pressure of software development what you usually end up with is your typical big-bang integration/deployment CF.<p>Stepping into a time machine, going back to the origin of your software system and rewriting it to be better is far, far easier than writing a new system to replace an existing, running system that's supporting a large volume of business.<p>An important question to ask is: when are you fully committed to the new system? The right answer should be ""when it's proven itself better"", but typically the answer is ""when we've started coding it"", the latter is hugely risky. It's best to think of rewrites as creating an internal competitor that has to prove itself at every point.<p>tl;dr Rewrites are a different kind of software project than normal development, failing to appreciate that typically leads to failure of the rewrite.",1295986151

Not just from other attractive companies, but competition from startups and from people deciding to go indy.  The opportunity available for someone doing their own thing is better right now than it ever has been before.<p>For example, in 2000-2005 I had all kinds of ideas for things I wanted to do, but ultimately got discouraged by the fact that, even though I had excellent software development skills and great ideas, I lacked the capital and knowledge to, for example, set up a rack of servers or a bank of fax machines in a closet somewhere.  Today, in stark contrast to even 2005, those kinds of hurdles are totally gone.  It's very easy to get servers set up in the cloud to do whatever you need.<p>Also it's far easier to succeed independently than it was a few years ago.  In the computer games space, where I make my money, self-publishing is a seriously viable alternative now (I'm living proof!), where a few years ago you mostly needed to work for a game studio to actually make a living.<p>Google is still a god-like entity that many of us would love to work for, but there's a comparatively new form of competition that's probably hitting Google harder than ever before: the fact that it's 10x more viable to do your own thing today than it was in 2005 or 2007.",1295985711

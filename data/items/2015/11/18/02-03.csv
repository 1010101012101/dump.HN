10585613,comment,10554021,10584831,0,0,djoshea,,,"It&#x27;s a great question, and I think this is a pretty good  insight into the general state of the field of neuroscience at the cellular level. We know a lot of details about things going on inside neurons, and a lot of details about synapses. And these details are often specific to one of the hundreds of different types of neurons that are found in different parts of the brain. (e.g. <a href=""http://www.neuroelectro.org/neuron/index/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neuroelectro.org/neuron/index/</a>). And we do have methods to measure and manipulate various things in neurons in a dish. But the dynamics of a neuron&#x27;s voltage are complicated, non-linear, and time-varying, and there are many parameters (e.g. the concentrations of numerous ionic species and other small molecules, many of which we probably don&#x27;t even know about yet).<p>Even then, going from these messy biological details (e.g. these 20 proteins assemble into a particular form and release this neurotransmitter from this synapse when X happens) to an explanation for how the neuron works at a more algorithmic level is hard, and the field isn&#x27;t there yet. Assembling and abstracting the details is hard and it&#x27;s one of the goals of theoretical neuroscience. The complexity is probably a symptom of our lack of understanding, rather than the cause of it, i.e. there probably are a lot of details that we can abstract away in a simpler functional model.<p>I haven&#x27;t read the paper, and I&#x27;m only vaguely familiar with Hawkins et al.&#x27;s HTM work. But I disagree with the claim at the end of the TR piece that these predictions are imminently testable. Thinking up a specific experiment to try and disprove theoretical ideas is often the hardest part of experimental neuroscience.",1447815074

10585524,comment,10576155,10584589,0,0,mikekchar,,,"When I temporarily went into teaching (5 years... lol) after a career of programming, I still wanted to write software every day.  The only problem was that I only had small pieces of time -- usually 20-30 minutes here or there. It was a kind of enforced pomodoro.  Of course, I suffered exactly the same problem that you do, but even worse because it would be hours before I could pick up the code again.<p>My solution was to try to swap out that context to disk :-)  I&#x27;m back in software again and I&#x27;ve refined my techniques a bit.  It&#x27;s helpful for me because as I get older, I can hold less context in my brain than I used to be able to do anyway.  There are 2 main places I store context: tests and TODOs.<p>I&#x27;ll start with TODOs.  I actually use Emacs org mode for TODOs.  The best part about Org mode is that it is in a text editor.  That means that I interact with it the same way that I interact with any other tool.  It is also hierarchical, which means that I can embed TODOs within TODOs.  Finally, it is folding, which means that I can ignore large sections of the TODO list, or move sections around with just a few keystrokes.<p>Basically, as I&#x27;m programming, whenever I have the thought, &quot;Oh, I have to do this&quot;, it goes in the TODO (even if I&#x27;m just about to do it).  You have to be terse because you don&#x27;t want it to take more than 1 or 2 seconds to jot down.  But terse is OK.  I actually have 2 editors open -- one that I&#x27;m programming in and one with Org mode.  I switch between windows in tmux.  This is the fastest way for me, but if you use Emacs normally, then Org Capture might be faster.<p>Every time I finish something, I go back to org mode, mark it DONE and then reorder my TODO list.  It only takes about 10 seconds to reorder the TODO list and it&#x27;s useful time for me to think about what I&#x27;m doing.<p>The easier bit for keeping context is tests.  As I&#x27;m getting near the end of the pomodoro, I make sure that I have a failing test.  If everything is passing at the moment, I quickly write a failing test.<p>When I return from the pomodoro, the first thing I do is run the tests.  This shows the failing test.  At that point, I only concern myself with fixing that test.  If you are used to doing TDD, then it usually only takes 30 seconds or a minute to fix the failing test.  This is like a bit of a boot loader to get you back into the problem.  After the test is finished, I go to the TODO and reorder them.  Often it doesn&#x27;t have to be reordered, but the act of thinking about priorities restores the context for me.<p>Currently, I&#x27;m doing some experiments where I am recording myself doing a large kata where I do one pomodoro per day (the ultimate in context killing).  I don&#x27;t have any conclusions yet, but the techniques I describe above seem to be working well.<p>I&#x27;m using Asciinema to record myself and it elides portions where you are idle for a certain number of seconds (I have it set to 2 seconds).  In other words it removed bits where you are doing nothing for more than 2 seconds.  By comparing the actual time spend to the length of the recording, I can see how long I was idle.  At the moment, it seems to be averaging about 5 minutes for every 25 minute pomodoro.  That doesn&#x27;t seem to be excessive to me (since I am reading documentation and thinking occasionally).",1447813576

10585500,comment,10580208,10581172,0,0,arca_vorago,,,"I really wanted to respond to your claim that, &quot;the first gulf war and the liberation of Kuwait was universally acknowledged as a &quot;just&quot; war.&quot;, but I happened to come upon a comment in another forum on Ray McGovern&#x27;s website that I think does a better job than I could.<p>Abe: &quot;The U.S. and the U.N. gave several public justifications for involvement in the First Gulf War, the most prominent being the Iraqi violation of Kuwaiti territorial integrity.<p>However, shortly before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, April Glaspie, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, had personally communicated to Saddam Hussein that America “took no position on these Arab affairs”.<p>In addition, the U.S. justified its military actions as support for Saudi Arabia, a key supplier of oil.<p>Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Defense Secretary Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested U.S. military assistance. During a speech in a special joint session of the U.S. Congress given on 11 September 1990, U.S. President George H. W. Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: “Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.”<p>The Pentagon stated that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were this information’s source, but this was later alleged to be false. A reporter for the St. Petersburg Times acquired two commercial Soviet satellite images made at the time in question, which showed nothing but empty desert.<p>Other justifications for foreign involvement included Iraq’s history of human rights abuses under Saddam. Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons, which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq War and against his own country’s Kurdish population in the Al-Anfal Campaign. Iraq was also known to have a nuclear weapons program, but the report about it from January 1991 was partially declassified by the CIA on 26 May 2001.<p>Although there were human rights abuses committed in Kuwait by the invading Iraqi military, the alleged incidents which received most publicity in the U.S. were inventions of the public relations firm hired by the government of Kuwait to influence U.S. opinion in favor of military intervention. Shortly after Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait, the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the U.S. It hired the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton for about $11 million, paid by Kuwait’s government.<p>Among many other means of influencing U.S. opinion (distributing books on Iraqi atrocities to U.S. soldiers deployed in the region, ‘Free Kuwait’ T-shirts and speakers to college campuses, and dozens of video news releases to television stations), the firm arranged for an appearance before a group of members of the U.S. Congress in which a woman identifying herself as a nurse working in the Kuwait City hospital described Iraqi soldiers pulling babies out of incubators and letting them die on the floor.<p>The story was an influence in tipping both the public and Congress towards a war with Iraq: six Congressmen said the testimony was enough for them to support military action against Iraq and seven Senators referenced the testimony in debate. The Senate supported the military actions in a 52–47 vote. A year after the war, however, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication. The woman who had testified was found to be a member of Kuwait’s Royal Family, in fact the daughter of Kuwait’s ambassador to the U.S.[95] She hadn’t lived in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion.<p>The details of the Hill & Knowlton public relations campaign, including the incubator testimony, were published in John R. MacArthur’s Second Front: Censorship and Propaganda in the Gulf War (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1992), and came to wide public attention when an Op-ed by MacArthur was published in The New York Times. This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony. After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction. President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.&quot;",1447813183

A lot of that challenge stems from how hard it is to properly convey what you are looking for in their work.  Often times they either have what it takes or they don&#x27;t, and to some extent, it is talent that can&#x27;t be taught no matter how much time you invest.<p>Starting with contract work is probably the best bet if you are still zeroing in on what you need.  But finding companies that do what you like and poaching their designers is another approach.<p>Without knowing the kind of feedback you&#x27;ve provided to your current designer, I think the other thing to look at is whether they are getting the feedback they need from you despite the time you&#x27;ve spent giving it.  If you are unclear in your feedback, or are communicating it in a way that isn&#x27;t super actionable to a designer, it can end up with both parties being extremely frustrated with no way forward.<p>Others here have given great advice on how to let them go, so best of luck with resolving this in a clean way.",1447812332

For example, if a mutual fund bought a stock twice in a year, and then sold that stock twice in a year, that&#x27;s 0.4% being gifted to the government right there? From just that mutual fund. And another 0.4% from whoever is on the other side? Wow!<p>Am I reading that right?<p>Also it says &quot;financial institutions&quot; but looks like it will also apply to individuals. The Wiki page says <i>&quot;If acting on behalf of a client, e.g., when acting as a broker, it would be able to pass on the tax to the client.&quot;</i><p>I think that could dry up trading volumes by about 95% in the affected countries. For example, when I sell stock now, a market maker takes the other side. But he won&#x27;t want to if he has to pay 0.1% for the privilege. So now I can&#x27;t sell a stock to an intermediary? I need to wait for another investor or a mutual fund to take the other side of my trade?<p>What am I missing? That can&#x27;t be right?<p>Edit: one immediate thing that sticks out is that &quot;derivatives&quot; will be created to replace stocks, since the tax savings is about 90% by doing that. For example, let&#x27;s say a stock costs $10.00. Why not create an &quot;American style&quot; call option on that stock, strike price $0.01, expiration date 2099. The value of that option is $9.99. But the tax rate is 0.01% on the derivative, vs 0.1% on the stock itself. Someone hasn&#x27;t thought things through here.",1447812153

Is it the user or the website? Or to put it another way, does the act of maximizing a window represent an intent or does it represent a default error state that needs to be worked around by laying out the content in a different way.<p>I think that the user should get to decide how wide they want the content to be.

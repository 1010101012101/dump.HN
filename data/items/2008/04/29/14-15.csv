176580,comment,175477,176570,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"I was referring to the exaggeration as the 'kool-aid'. I think network effects are self-evident, it's just that the term 'network effect' has transcended into buzzword territory. No economic principle operates perfectly in the real world, because not all people actually act rationally in the real world.",1209480855
176579,comment,176494,176494,0,0,joshwa,,,"Well, he's right, though not exactly for the reasons he states.<p>Display ads <i>are</i> in fact worth much less than search ads, for most web sites. Display ads aren't about clicking, they're about exposure/influence (kind of like outdoor or TV ads without an explicit call to action). There the CPMs are much lower, since they by definition less effective at producing sales. (though they are not completely valueless, since eyeballs without immediate conversions may still eventually convert)<p>He's also right that most people's idea of ""making money on the internet with ad-supported"" has in mind the glory days of $4 CPMs on banner ads. We haven't been there since '01 or so. So everyone's economic model is screwed up.<p>There are only two (and a half) ways to make money with ad-supported content on the internet:<p>-- 1) Conventional CPM display ads-- but you have to have <i>millions</i> of pageviews a month, and extremely low marginal costs, to make this profitable.<p>-- 1.5) Conventional CPM display ads, but on a extremely valuable niche site (e.g. a forum for doctors or lawyers). Here, though, there are probably more profitable ways of monetizing than ads.<p>-- 2) Extremely SERP-friendly content with adsense/affiliate ads: If your content is targeted enough that it appears in a Search Engine Result Page (or if you can arbitrage the traffic through paid search), then you can get visitors who are in search mode (marketers call this ""intent""), who will click through to your site, and then click an ad <i>on your site</i> related to their search. Think ""mesothelioma"" splogs.<p>If none of these work for you, you should consider alternate monetization methods (freemium, subscription, traditional bizdev/affiliate programs, etc).",1209480689
176578,comment,175930,176134,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"Right. I don't see how this does not apply to, e.g., an engineer or graphic designer who could create a product but not sell it, or sell it but not create it. These people can't survive except as part of a big company -- and they get that way by either getting hired, or starting a built-to-flip startup and selling out. It seems like a false dichotomy, since these are two ways for the same people to do the same thing.",1209480630

A pretty good compromise, if you ask me.  Oh, and it runs pretty fast.<p>(I haven't done a Clojure project, but I imagine it might be unpleasant dealing with the usual Java-isms in the libraries you'll have to use.

176571,comment,176494,176494,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This article makes a huge mistake that many entrepreneurs also fall victim to:<p>You and your friends are not the Internet.<p>There've been studies done on who clicks on ads (one was even linked here).  It's midwestern housewives, the same people who watch daytime TV and enter magazine sweepstakes.  I don't know a single person who watches Jerry Springer, enters sweepstakes, or uses MySpace over FaceBook, yet those people obviously exist.  They're worth billions of dollars.<p>For that matter, my friends usually don't pay attention to TV or print ads either.  They Tivo past the commercials or get their TV episodes off BitTorrent.  They skim past the advertisements in magazines.  They only look at the newspaper classifieds if they're actively looking to buy something.<p>A bigger problem for entrepreneurs is that roughly 99% of startups seem to target the same 10% of the market - the part that <i>doesn't</i> click on ads.  If your users come from TechCrunch or Digg or news.YC, it's a pretty good bet that they've learned how to filter out ads.  Most of the big consumer-web success stories - MySpace, PlentyOfFish, and lots that we don't hear about because they're not plugged into the Silicon Valley scene - succeed <i>because</i> they target a demographic that most of us can't identify with.",1209480225

The fastest sprinter in the world can probably run...what...2, 3, 4 times as fast as I can?  But the wealthiest guy in the world is worth many orders of magnitude more than I am, which is exponential, not a bell curve distribution.<p>Working at a normal company, doing a more or less normal job is more along the bell curve - you can make pretty good money as a top software guy somewhere, but (options aside), you're never going to get that lucky break and make zillions.  On the other hand, you might well make more than the startup guy, if he spends a year working on his own thing, 'for free', and then fails.<p>(See: The Black Swan)",1209480135

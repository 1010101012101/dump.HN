I don't know why you think moms aren't interested in GM cars. Around here GM trucks and cars are selling pretty well.<p>In any case a lot of people here, as another poster said, are confusing direct advertising with branding. I'm not in the market for a new car, but if I'm on Facebook, it's more than likely because I'm bored. If a car ad that looks good is on the page I'm on, I'm likely to click on it and look at the car. A year or two from now when I might be in the market, that make of car I keep seeing on FB is likely to be on my mind as a possible candidate.<p>And now that I think of it, I keep seeing brand new GM Yukons on the road and I like the way they look and they look like they are good tow vehicles. If I saw a Yukon ad on facebook, odds are I will click through.",1337119186

I have seen the negative attitudes of many self-ascribed ""programmers""  in the CS department at my University. I feel like a lot of this  comes from the point that Zed was making - the old dogs are upset because new people are circumventing how they learned to code. It's strange that some people hold so dearly to their old methods of learning, but I do feel like one must let go of that way of thinking if they wish to be happy.<p>The new methods of learning are great and they usually don't cement anyone into thinking they're a ""programmer."" One of my best friends goes to RISD and he learned to code from LPTHW and he is one of the best coders I know (although I think his style is weird sometimes... but that's beside the point). What matters is he is making cool things and he is humble about it. People shouldn't be too attached to any one thing on this earth, it takes away from our complexity as humans. We have such boundless potential and I hate to see that get knocked down by people who are afraid of losing their identity as a ""programmer."" Those people are so much more than that too! Even if they read all of Knuth's literature and have built compilers, humans aren't robots, why should we act like them? We must let go of the identities that cause to inflict harm on people.<p>Zed has come across as rather harsh in some of his writing, but this post is very beautiful. I'm not saying that Jeff is a bad guy, I'm just glad that Zed wrote this post.<p>Hopefully in time we can all let go of the identity of being a programmer. Most of us use libraries built by other people that are so abstracted anybody could do it! And what's cool about the people who are building the gnarly libraries is they put it out for opensource - they want people to use it 8^)<p>Don't be concerned with the bullies, go out there and have fun!",1337119163

3979108,comment,3977918,3978622,2,0,B-Con,,,"Huh, I majored in math, and I can't say that I understand what you mean.<p>In the lower division (first two years), there is often a separation of core classes between math majors and non-math majors. Calculus, for example, and linear algebra. They served as weeder courses for the math majors so that those who couldn't do good math wouldn't advance onto the upper division courses were they would continue to not do well. In addition, there was a somewhat misc. logic class for math majors that was very strict and served as a choke-point weeder class taken just before you would go onto upper division work.<p>For non-math majors, the Calculus classes were kind of weeder classes, but that wasn't their purpose. If you were an engineering, the engineers had their own real classes that were their own weeder classes. Etc.<p>But the two tracks disappeared after lower division. Once you were in 3rd year, there was largely only one set of classes. A couple of them had less rigorous counterparts for those only pursuing a teaching certification, but that was about it.<p>You are right that CS stands out. It's an unorganized field that is still trying to define itself. (Consider how young it is, relatively speaking.) Some schools want it to be mostly theory, others mostly software engineering, most are somewhere in between. There's disagreement over which languages to teach, how to teach them, etc. It's all somewhat awkward, and it needs to be reformed. I'm hoping that eventually we can split it into two separate fields, like CS theory and software engineering, and do a better job teaching both. (FWIW, I also majored in CS, so I saw both sides of the coin.)",1337118890

What he is saying is that it isn't necessary for everyone to learn how to code, that a lot of people seem to have a passing interest in it but aren't really serious about it.  His example is the fact that Mike Bloomberg is using it as a cheap political stunt, that his time as Mayor would be better spent accomplishing other things.

However, ""malware"" does often has the connotation of something that exploited a security vulnerability to end up on the system, hence terms like ""adware"" to cover software that introduces advertisements and often gets installed along with some other software package the user actually wanted.  And given the extensive tracking associated with most advertising, pretty much any adware will also qualify as spyware, though not to the same degree as software like keyloggers and similar.<p>Some people have also introduced broader terms like ""badware"" to encompass many different categories (<a href=""https://stopbadware.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stopbadware.org/</a>), but that term hasn't caught on nearly as much as ""malware"", ""spyware"", and ""adware"".<p>If a user truly did intentionally install a piece of software that explicitly said it would add advertising to arbitrary websites, and the software installed with the full knowledge and consent of the user, then by all means let the user annoy themselves.  But for every user somehow simultaneously knowledgeable enough to figure that out and yet not knowledgeable enough to avoid it, there exist several million users with unwanted adware, spyware, and malware on their systems.<p>(And in many cases, such a ""choice"" affects more than just that one user; most spam comes from infected systems, for instance, since that has a lot more ""value"" than just spamming the user of the infected system.)",1337117529

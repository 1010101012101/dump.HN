You'd need to compare it to the kind of salary someone capable of engineering would be able to earn in another field.  Salaries for a field can be higher than the median and still be lower than they would be in the absence of an H1B program.<p><Then why aren't people scrambling to become engineers like they did to become realtors or at least encouraging their children to become engineers?><p>I didn't notice anyone scrambling to get their kids into the real estate business.  But maybe the reason they don't encourage their kids into engineering is that they've seen that a similar or lesser effort in other fields would have a bigger payout?<p><Also it's not clear to me why you bring in PhD and master's. Most engineers in tech don't have those degrees.><p>I brought this up because it was used in the original article that promoted this thread.  It is often used to justify the need for an H1B program.",1242093558
604717,comment,603826,603826,0,0,davidmathers,,,"Two thoughts:<p>1. It helps to define your terms. My definitions, and what I think most people unconsciously mean, are that ""smart"" is all about making the best decisions and ""intelligence"" is all about pattern recognition. When you break it down like that it's obvious why ""more intelligent"" doesn't imply ""smarter"". The benefit of intelligence is that you can recognize patterns that other people don't, which can make you smarter. The downside is: the pattern might not be real, the pattern might not matter, analysis paralysis, etc. All of which can make you dumber. There's always a trade off. The post sums it up pretty well with:<p>""Less sophisticated developers would not have gone down this blind alley because they wouldn't have a clue that such a thing was even possible, let allow be able to figure out how to do it.""<p>2. Intelligence has very little to do with the ability to think rationally. Rational thought is a skill that has to be studied and practiced. It's also crazy hard. Really really insanely hard. It's hardness is massively unappreciated. Intelligent people who think they have it down because they're better at it then most people are just fooling themselves. Most people haven't even tried to become good at it, so being better then them isn't that hard.",1242093558

LEO to Geosynchronous orbit is still a lot more than 1% of energy to orbit.<p>Anyway, orbit is only 17,000 MPH which is way to slow to go travel to the next star. Traveling at at 17,000 mph would take about 40,000 years to travel one light year.  The good news is you slowly accelerate in space over a long time, so smaller high efficiency engines would work just fine.  The bad news is the closet star is over 4 light years from earth.<p>So getting something the size of the space shuttle to the next star in 1,000 years would take 2x (168^2) as much energy as it takes to get to LEO.  ~56,500 * 2.2 * 10^12J = ~10^17 jules for comparison that's ~28 thousand megawatt hours.",1242093031

We can't travel faster than light and at the moment not even close to it. We have vague ideas that warp drives might be possible, but generating, containing and manipulating enough energy to work in some of the suggestions is also currently unthinkable. We're at the stage of needing multiple unpredictable breakthroughs to get anywhere close, and that leaves travel to the nearest extra-solar <i>anything</i> taking many years.<p>Also, the Star Trek technology is very inconsistent, I don't think we are going that way. I haven't seen the new film (yet) but from the TV series, there are numerous questions. How come nobody else ever has Geordie-style visors as an option?

Why isn't there an anti-Borg good cyborg species? They destroy entire star ships so frequently and inconsequentially that they must have tremendous manufacturing capability, but wouldn't that have more ramifications somehow? How come Picard has a replacement heart and Geordi a brain-connected replacement vision, and everyone can be rebuilt by the teleporter, but they all have wrinkles and age and die? Why don't they throw half the Enterprise away and replace it with a much smaller holodeck with simulated rooms? Why does nobody ever ask the computer anything interesting? Why can't Data improve himself or replicate himself? Or merge with the ship's computer? Why has nobody built a machine to pick up what Deanna Troi's empathic sense does and done away with the whole ""Computer, where is x?""

I think that human progress, even in the short term, depends entirely upon ""breaking"" the first law of thermodynamics. Clearly, no one will successfully create energy out of nothing, but I hope that physics will one day invent a way to cheaply and cleanly tap into energy sources which produce a huge yield. We have nuclear reactors today, but they are enormously large, expensive, and difficult to maintain. The day that you can buy a car --- or a wristwatch --- powered by atomic energy, you can say that the future arrived.<p>This energy source does not have to be atomic, except we don't know of a fuel more densely packed with energy than atoms. E = mc^2 and all that. In most science fiction, this problem has been solved using mumbo-jumbo technology, such as matter-antimatter reactors. Whatever; maybe someone will one day think of a way to make that work. Solving the energy problem means that the vast amount of effort currently directed at, e.g., oil production, stable trade with parts of the world which produce and sell hydrocarbon fuels, and climate maintenance can free up to really push things forward.<p>Just think of the rockets we could build if they didn't need to use awful rocket propellants (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant</a>) or nuclear explosions for fuel.

Maybe if the data were more transparent I could understand better what Delores Labs' graph represents.<p>One problem I see in the methodology is that the sample size for each language would vary dramatically.

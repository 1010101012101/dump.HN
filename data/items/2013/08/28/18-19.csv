There were build servers and all the build scripts were automated and vcs-managed. You could package config changes or applications.

(I&#x27;m iOS-centric, so that&#x27;s my research area.)<p>Does anybody have any leads on how/where to get some mindshare for games that squarely target older folks?  I&#x27;m building games for them by making the games with these attributes:<p>* free - I&#x27;ve found that older folks really really really prefer free apps in the majority of cases<p>* clean, aka no gratuitous explosions/animations - From what I can tell, when presented with similar apps, older folks don&#x27;t want buttons that jiggle all over the place or lots of particle effects.  Instead, they want easy-to-read fonts and intuitive UIs<p>The unfortunate side effect of building games like this are that they are the opposite of what app/game review sites want to publish, because my games are purpose-built to be non-flashy, whereas the review sites want to see &quot;a new twist&quot; on a game or &quot;amazing graphics/theme&quot; wrapped on a game, in order to drive readership.  As stated above, older folks don&#x27;t read that anyways, so I guess it&#x27;s moot, but it brings me back to my question - how do I get more older folks to try my games?  :-)<p>PS - anybody here write for AARP?  ;-)",1377715957

It should be inconceivable, at a technical company, to hand over that much hiring power to a non-technical person.&quot;</i><p>And yet they often do. Consider that for a moment and wonder why it is so common, especially in technical companies.<p>What I have found over the years is that technical people hire people they think are great without regard to the HR &quot;signals&quot; and then one day they get screwed. Maybe they hire someone with anger management issues, maybe they hire someone whose antics expose the entire company to a crushing lawsuit. Or many they hire someone who, in short order, irritates all of the other employees such that there is a huge morale crash and exodus. Basically their hiring on technical merits and/or interview results in a very bad outcome. And then someone they know and respect says &quot;Gee, an HR person would have spotted that right away, why didn&#x27;t you listen to them?&quot; or worse &quot;Gee if my HR person had let that person through I would fire them on the spot.&quot;<p>You see in both cases something a bright technical person might be <i>actually unable to see</i>, could be the difference between a &quot;good hire&quot; and a &quot;bad hire.&quot; And <i>that</i> is how HR people get into positions of power over hires and fires.<p>1) The hiring manager has someone else to fire (and blame) when a hire goes badly.<p>2) The hiring manager has some &#x27;cover&#x27; over the things they don&#x27;t readily see (like emotional issues).<p>Of course since the whole emotional/psychology thing <i>is</i> so opaque to some folks it is really hard to judge if the person they have providing that visibility is good or not. Sort of like someone who knows nothing about technology hiring a consultant, or someone who knows nothing about cars hiring an auto mechanic. One has to take things on faith a bit that the other person knows what they are doing and try to come up with ways to re-assure yourself that this is true.",1377715050

Docker also implements incremental uploads and downloads, similar to git pull, so new versions of a container can be transferred by only sending diffs.<p>I get it now.

In other words, is mining a process open to probabilities or is it a process where you churn through a finite and predictable number of calculations before you dig up a coin?<p>I&#x27;d have to think one of the things that would lead someone to buy a shovel is that they could get lucky and dig up some gold. If luck isn&#x27;t a factor in BitCoin mining, then you&#x27;re not even giving yourself a chance to overcome a negative expected value situation.

He points out that territorialism in the animal kingdom is similar to property rights (obviously without the existence of a state). Animals mark their territory (e.g. with urine), and other animals tend to respect those boundaries, because there is mutual understanding that the territory holder will fight a trespasser to the death if necessary, and the damage to the trespasser (even a stronger trespasser) will most likely not be worth it. Perhaps the territory holder would be better off just retreating, but what makes it &quot;property&quot; is the near certainty that he <i>won&#x27;t</i> retreat.<p><a href=""http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Order_without_the_state/Order_Without_the_State.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Order_without_the_sta...</a>",1377714281

The facts (a) that the Econ are highly status-motivated, (b) that status is only to be achieved by making modls, and (c) that most of these modls seem to be of little or no practical use, probably accounts for the backwardness and abject cultural poverty of the tribe.

However, from my early experiments, it seems there&#x27;s an important difference between LXC (which is what Docker manages for you) and a full VM, namely that the model revolves around running one process at a time: you can install mySQL on your docker image, but once it&#x27;s up, it&#x27;s running mySQL -- you can&#x27;t then ssh into it as you would a VM to poke around, modify config files, etc..<p>There are trivial ways to solve this, obviously. You can stop the image, restart it running bash, use <i>that</i> to modify config files, and then restart it again. But it requires a change of mindset: these things are much more than background processes, but they are less than a full VM. As the piece mentions, configuration management for newly-started images seems to be a missing piece of the puzzle right now, and debugging running Docker images can be... strange. [2] Not necessarily difficult, but different from what you&#x27;re used to, and learning curves are barriers to adoption.<p>As this tech matures I think these things will be quickly solved, and I&#x27;m looking forward to the results.<p>[1] Plus Virtualbox, started by Vagrant.

It&#x27;s not as if the &quot;promotions&quot; or &quot;social&quot; inboxes have been blacklisted, I just tend to not care about the messages that end up in them (but I wouldn&#x27;t care about them if they ended up in my primary inbox, either)<p>When I actually come across an email that catches my attention from a service I find valuable, what do I do? I open it (yes, even when its in the lowly &quot;promotions&quot; inbox). That doesn&#x27;t happen too often though, because as is astutely pointed out, most of them are bullshit emails from services that I don&#x27;t care about.

If you just looked at the command line options without understanding what&#x27;s going on at all it might look similar.<p>> a tool like Puppet or Chef is needed when you have long-running VMs that could become inconsistent over time.<p>Uh, no, Puppet and Chef are designed for configuration management. To manage your configs. They are not designed to replace customization and they don&#x27;t address package management or service maintenance. (They have options to munge these things, but you still need a human to make them useful and coordinate changes with your environment) Neither does Docker. Docker also doesn&#x27;t do configuration management. All different things.<p>> You&#x27;ll be 100% sure what runs locally will run on production.<p>Incorrect; you&#x27;re using unions to fill in the missing dependency gaps, so there&#x27;s no guarantee what was on your testing container&#x27;s host is on your production container&#x27;s host. Your devs also might be running with container A and B, but in production you&#x27;re using containers A and C. Not to mention the kernels may be different, providing different functionality. All this assuming A, B and C don&#x27;t need instances of different configuration. There are no guarantees.<p>You know what else is crazy fast and easy to manage? Packages. There&#x27;s this new idea where you can have an operating system, run the command &#x27;apt-get install foobar&#x27;, and BAM all of a sudden foobar is installed. If you need a dependency, it just installs it. And it only downloads what it needs. Also does rollback, transactions, auditing, is multi-platform, extensible, does pre-and-post configuration, etc. Sound a lot like docker? That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a simpler and more effective version of docker [without running everything as a virtualized service].<p>Deploy using your package manager. Except for slotted services which (AFAIK) no open-source package manager supports, it will do everything you need. And what it doesn&#x27;t do, you can hack in.",1377712964

The key thing that was missing was copyrightability. You&#x27;re right that the appeals court might affirm the district judge&#x27;s ruling, but we&#x27;ll know in early 2014 what comes out of this.

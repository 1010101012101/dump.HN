3818891,comment,3817319,3817779,9,0,masklinn,,,"> A common solution to this problem, is to make a 2 stage process, where step 1 is a request of ""should I download?"", where there are 2 possible replies: ""no, check again in N time"" and ""yes, here is a token"". Step 2 is then presenting the token to the api point for download, and getting the file.<p>You don't even need two steps, just have one step with previously known data. That's how HTTP conditional requests (Last-Modified/If-Modified-Since and ETag/If-None-Match) work: the client states ""I want this file, I already have one from such moment with such metadata"", and the server replies either ""you're good"" (304) or ""here's your file (200).<p>Issue is, that only works when the file changes rarely enough, or you need additional server logic to reply that the file is still good when it's not.<p>> Now that I think of it: it seems that this would be a nice nginx plugin, with a simple client side library to handle it for reference. Anyone want to collaborate on this over the weekend?<p>I'd be <i>very</i> surprised if nginx didn't support conditional requests already.<p>edit: according to [0] and [1]  which may be outdated  Nginx provides built-in support for last-modified on static files, it does not provide ETag support (the developer believes this is not useful for static files  which is usually correct[2]) but [1] has apparently written a module to do so [3].

Corporation has other advantages because it's a separate entity that comes in handy to shield yourself from some personal liabilities.  Again, it depends on what you're doing.<p>Incorporation depends on your needs - many choose delaware - they make it easy and cheap but there are hidden issues.

My initial thought when hearing about this deal was that FB could be more worried about Twitter. In my personal experience, many people will share instagram photos on twitter rather than Facebook as it comes across as less ""spammy"" to share photos frequently. Certainly, IMO, the subscribe feature that FB introduced last year was a reaction to the celebrity cult on Twitter. Granted, Mark claims that the acquisition of instagram will not affect the ability to share to other social networks, but I'm sure they will try to make FB the preferred platform to post photos as a daily update. It will be interesting to see if Twitter suffers a drop in photo sharing as a result.",1334001172

Yes, FP works well for concurrency.  But if you're complaining about data races, letting a thread own a piece of data and only be able to share it via channels solves the concurrency problem too.  Thus imperative languages can live on if they adopt memory models in which data is owned by a single thread and cannot be shared.  I notice Rust has a mechanism for sharing this kind of data by transferring ownership.  That looks pretty cool to me.<p>Also, there are still plenty of applications where high level scripting languages like Python and Ruby work great for application logic, and where single threaded event-based systems work for handling user events.  It's the data processing part that needs to be put in a safe concurrency sandbox.",1334000849

People who primarily do parallel programming think everything needs to be parallel, so they assume everyone must be going through the pain they are going through.  This is false.  Most people write sequential software.<p>Another issue is that purely functional programming is fundamentally flawed, because it attempts to eschew state.  Many functional programmers will call this a virtue, but the world is stateful, and being able to reason about necessary state is how you do anything useful.  Purely functional programming is great when you want a convenient test-bed for  ideas, but Haskell as a practical programming language is a horrible idea.  Ultimately, what we want is to eliminate unnecessary state, while reasoning about necessary state.  Modern programming language researchers are doing this under the guise of ""effects systems"", however most of the research I've seen far has left me underwhelmed.<p>Eventually functional programming researchers are going to end up somewhere that is quite far from where they started, but just a few small steps from logic programming.",1334000766

A bunch of cells give up the chain of command and start co-opting resources to feed their opulent lifestyles. What this means is that no simple cure is going to work, cancer effectively exists to solve the problem of maximizing its growth or survival rate. Treatments are just another constraint that increase the dimensionality of the cancers' search space.<p>- Tumorous cell lines are invaders even if they originate from the body and evolve at a breakneck pace. This is why many treatments fail to work - not that the ideas behind them are wrong but the system has outsmarted it. Cancer is dynamic not static.<p>I found this inspiring and positive. While some may despair from a lack of a cure what I see is progress. We've gone from the boundless optimism that comes from ignorance to the sober determination that comes from an awareness of the extent of our ignorance. So now maybe the real work can begin.<p>He says tackling the evolutionary aspect of cancer will be key. I wonder if game theory will  inform future treatments. Or if there will be things people will take to reduce mutations or lend  better error correction - outside immune and optionally germ cells.

3818786,comment,3817648,3817648,43,0,alexholehouse,,,"One angle I feel is often missed in the whole cancer discussion is that it's a multidimensional problem.<p>1) Developing drugs which can damage cancer cells selectively.<p>Like selecting a few needles in a haystack, cancer cells typically ""look"" the same as healthy cells, which makes selectively destroying them very difficult. Some cancers (such as CML) have a specific driver mutant proteins which allows for a pinpoint attack (Gleevec), but if this target protein mutates and Gleevec can no longer bind then that drug instantly becomes totally ineffective.<p>2) Identifying malignant tissue<p>Surgery is still one of the most important tools against many forms of cancer, yet being able to identify malignant tissue vs. healthy stuff has always been a problem. In the first half of the 20th century the radical mastectomy was all the rage, but in reality provided little benefit. I was lucky enough to see Roger Tsein speak a few years ago (Nobel prize for GFP) who is pioneering a way to fluorescent tag malignant tissue which can be viewed in real time to give surgeons an augmented reality overview of a tumour to maximize the chance of getting all the malignant cells.[<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Y._Tsien#Fluorescence-assisted_cancer_surgery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Y._Tsien#Fluorescence-ass...</a>].<p>3) Stopping metastasis<p>Even if a patient presents with a tumour and that tumour is removed, it's impossible to tell if any of the maligant cells have managed to escape to other parts of the body, where they slowly start to regroup before launching a subsequent attack. This is the primary reason why cancer survivors have 5Y and 10Y survival rates as opposed to, ""You're cured"". The mechanism and time in a cancer at which this happens depends on so many factors its currently almost impossible the predict.<p>4) Drug delivery<p>The tumour micro environment is so foreign compared to the normal stromal environment, and moreover so heterogeneous between tumour types (which in turn depends both on a cancer's underlying genotype and its associated tissue, vascularization and a wide range of additional factors) that creating drugs which can just <i>survive</i> long enough to act on their target can be difficult. This, combined with the fact that tumours are, compared to normal tissue, often poorly vascularized, means just getting drugs in can be a major challenge. I remember reading how often the vascularization of a tumour can be proportional to rate of growth and inversely proportional to chemotherapeutic efficacy (although don't quote me because I can't find the reference) meaning smaller, slower growing tumours often represent those most difficult to treat while larger, more aggressive ones may respond better, if caught in time.<p>5) Cancer is effectively microscale evolution<p>Perhaps the biggest problem is that once cancer cells begin to acquire some initial mutations (and lie in a pre-cancerous form) they're often more susceptible to further mutations. In a way, this allows them to employ a sort of bet-hedging strategy, such as that seen by yeast or other single celled organisms. No longer can we treat the cancer cells as part of our multicellular body, but as a separate, single celled population. This means that even if certain drugs are effective, there will be a small population of cancer cells who may have mutated in such a way that they are resistant, so even if a treatment gets 99% of the cells, that final 1% can restart and the same bet-hedging strategy is re-employed to create another, diverse set of cells. This is totally analogous to antibiotic resistance. The range of this diversity varies significantly between cancers, but as we ""pick out"" the easier ones with an obvious target, this will become an every increasing issue.<p>These are just a few points - there are more, but I've tried to focus on ones not yet brought up in discussion. This is an area I have some experience with, and if anything is unclear let me know and I'll do my best to explain.<p>[EDIT]: This is not meant to be quite as, ""we're all doomed"" as it appeared. I think Dn_Ab's post summarizes how I feel more accurately. The development in a range of different areas has been staggering (childhood leakemia, CML, Her2+ BC etc), and the reason this is such a daunting task is because the magnitude has only reared its large, complex head in the last 10-15 years or so. Despite the challenges, it is a very exciting time to be a cancer biologist.",1333999984

Talking specifically about hetero males at the moment, for the sake of discussion, I hope we can all also acknowledge value for men in relationships with women beyond sex - ""they're funny, interesting, loyal, give good advice, etc"" as you mention, with the ""etc"" representing a huge list of additional items.<p>But the point is not whether you <i>can</i> be friends with a member of the sex you are sexually oriented towards, but whether you can be <i>just</i> friends.<p>Take your list of female friends and think about each one in turn. Please only include people that you invest in a relationship with, not just acquaintances or additional people that happen to be around or in your social circles. For each, assume that both you both have no social/practical/ethical/moral constraints keeping you apart (other relationships, for example). Further assume that somehow this person is the best reasonable prospect for a mate available to you. Would you pursue a romantic relationship with her?<p>You seem to suggest that you find some of your friends attractive. I can take this no other way except to mean attractive as a potential mate or sexual partner (though you don't intend to act on this in your current situation - that is understood). For those you consider attractive I will assume that the answer to the question is ""yes"", you would pursue her. I think we are getting into the definition of attraction here and I can't think of another way to look at it.<p>Are there any in your list that you would answer ""no"" to? Why? I suspect that an honest assessment would yield very few or not any ""no"" answers for female friends that a man has developed a friend relationship with beyond the acquaintance level. Am I wrong?<p>I think it is natural that the things that draw you to a woman in friendship probably correlate strongly with your list of what makes women attractive to you, so you will tend to be friends with women you consider attractive. Please don't read any suggestion of ill intent into this - that's not the point. Again, the point is that we are talking about whether you can <i>just</i> be friends. The sexual attraction and potential for romance, even if very theoretical, will often or nearly always be there and will color the relationship, perhaps even in a very subtle way. It does not mean you have any conscious sexual designs, but it is still part of the relationship.",1333999050

(We're also using Ruby for our build system, for example, because we like it, and think it's the right tool for the job.)<p>I think for the library code itself we prefer using JavaScript because in lots of ways it allows very fine-tuned control, one (of many) examples for this is deliberately using == instead of ===.",1333998620
3818661,comment,3816646,3818322,4,0,stepcut,,,"I think that as far as the end user is concerned, there is not much difference between the warp, Snap, and Happstack backends.<p>Speed-wise, warp is maybe 3 times faster than Snap and Happstack in the pong test. Though, how that plays out in real world is hard to say. But, I doubt anyone is running a Haskell web server right now that needs anywhere close to 30,000+ requests/second. Of course, speed never hurts. Even if you are not doing a lot of requests per second, the totally latency per request counts for something. So, I see no reason for Happstack to be slower than it could be.<p>Because Happstack is based on lazy IO instead of conduits/enumerators/pipes, there is a perception that it must be leak files and RAM like crazy. But, that is  not actually true. The server handles streaming files from disk fine, and even streaming files in POST/PUT to disk in a constant space. We had to be careful inside the server code to make that happen -- but the end user never has to deal with that for the most part.<p>One exception is when the user wants to use IO to generate a streaming response. For example, if you were wrote an algorithmic music generator that required IO and streaming an never ending MP3. To do that in happstack-server, you could need to use unsafeInterleaveIO. And, be a bit careful.<p>But, just because lazy IO can work, doesn't mean that something like Pipes would not be better. Happstack predates enumerators/pipes/conduits, so lazy IO was the best choice at the time :) The idea of moving Happstack away from lazy IO has been an the plate for a long time (before Snap and Yesod were even created). Originally we were going to move to the hyena backend. But then Johan went on a major yak shaving expedition and rewrote the GHC I/O manager, etc, instead of finishing hyena.<p>We did consider switching to warp. But there are a few reasons we decided not to:<p>1. The source code for warp did not fill me with confidence (yes.. entirely subjective). So, in the new (currently unnamed) happstack-server backend (which will be standalone similar to warp), I want to create a strong body of evidence that it actually works correctly.<p>2. I like pipes. At least, I like the way they are designed by starting with the core principles and semantics and trying to build something up that is based around solid math foundation like Category. Now, Michael Snoyman may be correct that pipes are not suitable for implementing an http proxy. Once the next pipes (that has resource finalization and exception handling) is out, I intend to discover if that is true or not (acme-http-proxy). (Once again, very subjective).<p>3. I want Happstack to be a stable platform. Historically, yesod has gone through a lot of radical changes. Something is there one day, and gone the next. My previous experiences trying to collaborate directly and indirectly with the yesod team have left me nervous about building on their work. The yesod project is focused on what is best for their own purposes -- which is fine. But, it means that if you are trying to build on it, you have to be ready to accept whatever may drop out of the sky tomorrow morning. (Also subjective).<p>4. the yesod dependency hell problem gives me concern as well. While the problems they are experiencing are fundamental to Cabal itself, they seem to be hit a lot harder than Happstack. So, until that is all sorted out, I don't want to make Happstack installs more likely to fail.<p>Given that warp is less than 1000 lines, it seems like the risks and loss of control involved with trying to leverage it do not really outweigh the cost of implementing a solution that is exactly what we want.<p>So, I am aiming for better design, performance, and correctness.<p>In terms of features.. I'm saving that surprise for later :)",1333998608

So in the case of the 3rd round, first they got their $40M back, but they retained 8% of the pool. Same with the 7M etc. Call it $50M off the billion right off the bat, leaving 950 million. Doesn't really dent the number (reduction of 5% for the founders, so they each walk away with $128M, but that is still 7 million less). Also, this assumes no advisors got shares or board members got shares and that really early hires got no shares outside of the ESOP, which is unlikely).

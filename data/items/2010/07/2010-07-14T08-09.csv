However, I am not wanting to get into the business of selling a hardware device, I only want to make the plans for the community to solve all the issues surrounding it.<p>FreeNAS is almost there, and they do seem to support ZFS now that I was looking into it more today.  It looks like it is now just a matter of finding the right hardware.  I think I do need 5 disks, 4 for backup and one for parity.<p>Hopefully it will support Time Machine right out of the box, since Time Machine backs to a sparse bundle, which by nature, can handle all the Mac OS X meta data.<p>Are you aware of anything that is 5-6 disks, GB, 5-6 SATA ports, or 2-3 multiplied, that is not huge, ugly, and massively expensive?<p>Thanks for the pointers, I will start looking into the core if/i7 stuff too.",1279097948

  master’s lesson on an ordinary girl. After all, you don’t 
  feel so bad disrespecting a bar girl who’s trying to get 
  you to buy her drinks — but a nice, ordinary, Southern girl?

  We went into the bar, and before I sat down, I said, 
  “Listen, before I buy you a drink, I want to know one 
  thing: Will you sleep with me tonight?”

  “Yes.”

  So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how 
  effective the lesson was, I never really used it after 
  that. I didn’t enjoy doing it that way. But it was 
  interesting to know that things worked much differently

Has anyone ever tried to make a cylinder whose piston is composed of a highly durable magnet at one end, which is encased in a coil. The bottom is basically a magnet which repels the piston, and a mechanical spring is also used to keep the process going.<p>When the fuel will ignite and expand there will be a huge change in EMF, perhaps that could be used to charge a capacitor which can then offload it more slowly into a battery. In this way mechanical parts are reduced and frictional losses are kept at a minimum since I am not driving a crankshaft, which then feeds into a dynamo with gearing.<p>I've heard about solenoid engines, but has anyone ever undertaken something like this? I am sure that tons of people must have this in their heads, but has anyone also used a tesla coil with a variable AC to control the motion of the piston? That is we can also remove the bottom magnet and the mechanical spring. This would be something awesome to make, and I wonder if it is feasible to do so.<p>One of the biggest worries would be the lack of appropriate magnets. Neodymium (NdFeB) start losing magnetic strength above 60 C and it becomes completely demagnetized before 90 C. So, one of the reasons why someone hasn't done this might be lack of an cost effective alloy which can remain magnetized at those temperatures. I really can't think of another reason.",1279096736

Hire a designer who knows nothing about limitations of the platform, hire a programmer who cannot tell cyan from blue and you will spend the majority of your time trying to fit square pegs in round holes and acting as a translator between the two with little success.
And let's not forget that with the current move to more and more interactive designs doing static mockups makes less and less sense. There is some truth in ""CSS is the new Photoshop"".

Erickson, for those who don't know, was a psychiatrist who was the great 20th century master of hypnosis; he turned everything about the field on its head. Presumably these guys were there to pick up some hypnotic tricks to add to their game. Anyway, my point is: Holy cow, were they creepy. Creepy in a way that makes you want to stay on the other side of the room. One in particular seemed to have developed lizard-like qualities. Seeing them in person was, for me, something of a counterargument to their teachings.",1279095205

I have many friends who are worth $3-5M and they do not consider themselves even close to rich in the valley. Housing and schooling in Palo Alto are very expensive. $5M is nowhere near enough to buy a really nice house and then take it easy for the rest of your life - sad to say, but true.<p>At least in the valley, most people still live below their means. I find that on the East Coast and Southern CA that those with expensive lifestyles are usually heavily burdened by debt. There are many many wealthy people in the valley who live in simple apartments and walk everywhere, not needing the flashy car or flashy clothes to justify their existence and place in society.",1279095087

repel me the most.<p>Everyone I met associated with this system, so far have been someone trying to make money off of it, or a misguided person using the system to justify lying, or someone truly dishonest to them selves.<p>I spent well over 18 months and thousands of Dollars on perfecting this system. I have not met someone who can demonstrate a convincing or awe inspiring performance or at the least a good personality. Most of it is the hype built around very normal qualities.<p>The introverts build hype for the socially talkative PUAs whom you might find very annoying at work or in classroom. The extroverts build hype for those intelligently speaking PUAs whose ideas might be very questionable. Some guys build
hype for the other PUAs who socially disrespect women. PUA is just a title that many of these folks are working hard to get to satisfy their egos and mask their insecurities.<p>One guy advised me to wear a huge bunch of keys around my pants, because women think you are in charge of something big. One guy advised me to own the room when I walk in. The other guy I met introduced himself as someone who goes to 
university and also works in a big software corporation full time when he works at a small restaurant.<p>Most people who are attracted to this are the ones who lacked male role models in their lives and those from countries like India where marriage is the only way and life outside work is confusing still.<p>Like many other people from my background I felt cheated by the traditional system, which advised to be a good social norms respecting and social expectation meeting person and get a good education, good job, life security etc in exchange for abundant opportunity for sex(remember make love to me randy from south park). In fact the exactly 
same things are considered a boring personality but if you are a romeo, not having a decent job, depending on friends and family, can have a full time duty talking to women every where, you are considered Romantic by women. Having seen my friend's wives leave their PhD husbands for a ""leisurely life"" guy, and reading a lot about cheating girl friends, ""The game"" opened my eyes. It gave a promise size of a Mount Everest. The results were not that satisfactory but at least I got some better parts from it like self improvement and being less socially awkward. 
Like some one here advised, dating is really a numbers game and the rest is self-improvement",1279095017

1513986,comment,1513391,1513391,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I think much of this stems from a conflict at the heart of the problems with modern higher education.<p>From the one side is the perspective that school is a burden. That tests, assignments, and homework are a trial to be endured until you are rewarded with your certification of official recognized smart-ness. That the student-teacher interaction is an adversarial relationship between authority figure and child.<p>From another perspective comes the idea that school is an opportunity. That tests, assignments, and homework represent the cobblestones on the road you must travel to acquire knowledge. That the student-teacher interaction is a cooperative relationship between mature, adult peers.<p>Increasing demand for degrees partly due to the rise in credentialism in the work-force combined with prolonged immaturity (professional, personal, financial) in young adults has combined to assault the quality of education from both sides, leading toward the former perspective becoming increasingly dominant. Through such forces the acquisition of knowledge transforms into the plodding repetition of busywork and finally into little more than a monetary transaction. At this point we are already well past the stage where the average quality of a college education has degraded to shamefully dismal levels, it is only now that the signals are becoming too obvious for us to continue ignoring it.",1279094528

1140218,story,,,1,0,smart,"Thoughts On Freebie Trading",,"I read an interesting article about freebie trading and how it is ""The Internets Biggest Scam."" From what I can tell, it does sound like a scam and it also sounds dishonest (having only this article to base my opinion on).<p>What are your opinions on the subject? Is there a legitimate form of Freebie trading? Is there anyone doing it who is not ripping people or companies off? Furthermore, what is freebie trading exactly?<p>This topic also interests me because I have been using TrialPay as a payment alternative on one of my sites for about 2 years (Google ""free tie""). Basically TrialPay pays me for a product that I give to my customer for free if my customer participates in a trial or discounted offer from TrialPay affiliates (Netflix, Gap, etc.). I've never had any customers report a problem with them and I've used them myself to get free stuff for trying offers. Just recently I got a free pizza for trying Netflix through TrialPay.<p>Is that considered freebie trading? Thanks in advance for your comments.<p>Here is a link to the article ""The Internet's Biggest Scam"" on ABC News http://abcnews.go.com/Business/TheBigMoney/big-internet-scam/story?id=9801482",1266731851

If they are trying to turn Node into something else they are going to hit a brick wall.<p>The proposal acknowledges that the current JS/V8 cannot really deliver on the original promise that all IO should be async. This is mainly because of awkward syntax in JS. The awkward syntax comes from the lack of native futures.<p>There are two ways forward: Change JS and add native futures to Node or supply blocking IO libraries to the users and move the complexity of async vs blocking to the programmers. \nIf that's the path they chose, what will distinguish Node from high performance network libraries in other languages, such as EventMachine and Twisted? Node has it's reputation for speed precisely because it doesn't offer any blocking operations.<p>Personally I think the focus should be on crafting transparent futures into the JS language that Node uses. \nTake the IO language as an example: <a href=""http://www.iolanguage.com/scm/git/checkout/Io/docs/IoGuide.html#Concurrency-Futures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iolanguage.com/scm/git/checkout/Io/docs/IoGuide.h...</a>",1266729291

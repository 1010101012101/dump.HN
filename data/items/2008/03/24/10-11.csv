All I did was replacing the iteration with normal dictionary lookup.""<p>can someone explain how to do a normal dictionary lookup?<p>what is that? and is there something similar in PHP?",1206356004

On the beach.<p>People walk in wearing t-shirts and flip-flops, I make them a sandwich, and they go away happy. Immediate gratification for both of us, plus I get to invent cool sandwiches.

Seems to me, however, that no matter how much money you have, you cease to be poor once you move beyond looking to external actors for the source of your internal pain. Or perhaps that statement is a bit too Zen for the board. Dunno.",1206355319

144459,comment,144390,144457,0,0,tim2,,,"Utilizing reputations through clustering of voting histories in order to produce their recommendations is a pretty good description of what's going on there now. Next they're planning on giving you even more control by allowing you to control who you trust directly. This combined system should be the special sauce that really solves this problem, I think.",1206354750

144454,comment,144097,144188,0,0,ghshephard,,,"More important is to routinely rotate strong root passwords.  What most people neglect to mention, when denying root access to an SSH server, is that people then login with a second account, (you still need ssh), and then su - to root.  So, all you've really done is moved the difficultly in logging onto the server from the root account, to the secondary account+root account.  Your security is now based on the strength of that bi-pair of passwords.  As others have mentioned, moving logins to RSA keys (very easy) is probably a better approach.",1206352910

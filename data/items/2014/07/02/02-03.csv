And please, help me understand (and I promise not get into the usual &#x27;no action,&#x27; &#x27;too many drama queens&#x27; objections--although it is confusing when a player falls down like he&#x27;s been stabbed, and the player who stabbed him also suddenly falls down.)<p>Messi is a freakish talent, but how many of his exceptional maneuvers translate into goals? I don&#x27;t know Messi&#x27;s ratio, but would Michael Jordan&#x27;s talent have meant so much if style points didn&#x27;t also show up on the scoreboard? We make fun of baseball because a successful batting average is three in ten (.300) and .400 is god-like. Messi&#x27;s miracles pay off, sure, but -- for the casual American fan -- the effort needs to ring the bell or it doesn&#x27;t count.<p>Top level competition (Euro leagues) is a completely different game (and vastly superior) to what the kids play here, or even school boys and universities. It&#x27;s like pro baseball vs. weekend softball. And very few moms and dads, even a full generation into &#x27;the soccer generation&#x27; know much or care.<p>Americans won&#x27;t go &#x27;all in&#x27; if they can&#x27;t win. Belgium: 11 million people? That&#x27;s Tennessee and Alabama. The day an SEC team can go to Europe and compete, that&#x27;s when the US has become a soccer power.<p>I love the World Cup--once every four years. Those guys are tremendous athletes with freakish skills. But I still don&#x27;t care. I leave the broadcast on for background noise, like golf or NASCAR or CNN.<p>Please HN, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.",1404269511

If all the good stories were able to reach the front page even briefly, I&#x27;m convinced that the story quality on HN would be much higher. So this problem is actually my primary focus these days when I have time to work on the code.<p>You&#x27;re a bit mistaken about there being no system to give second chances right now. If an article hasn&#x27;t had significant attention within about the last year, we don&#x27;t treat reposts as dupes. That already helps quite a lot. However, the ideas that we&#x27;re hoping to implement around this are different and, if they work, will have a more dramatic effect.

I kind of like that stuff and I find the root question very interesting. I mean the question of whether the postwar social order which has been so stable is threatened by current macroeconomic developments. But (qua moderator again) I think any HN discussions on that need to be seeded with higher-quality material.<p>So the reason you were frustrated in this case is not HN&#x27;s dupe detector, it&#x27;s that a moderator is more or less calling an article you like off-topic for HN.

Sites like Myredbook, Backpage, Rubmaps (and at one time even craigslist) are Hydratic. [1] like Hydra, when you take down one, two will appear in its place. Has the FBI not learned by now that it does not have jurisdiction over the entire internet? New sites can pop up in any non-FBI jurisdiction or on Tor, and there isn&#x27;t shit the FBI can do.<p>The FBI needs to accept that shutting down these sites is not a sustainable option. Instead, it should <i>cultivate</i> the sites that are in US jurisdiction, and <i>allow</i> them to operate, so that the FBI can use them to monitor illicit activity.<p>Prositution is a victimless crime. Human trafficking is not. Unfortunately, without legalizing and regulating prostitution worldwide, it&#x27;s impossible to disambiguate between an autonomous sex worker and a human trafficking victim. But sites like these can really help with that disambiguation.<p>The FBI should be working toward this disambiguation. It should be filtering out the sex workers from the human trafficking victims, because the latter are the only actual victims in this business.<p>The FBI needs to realize that sites like these are an <i>asset</i> to the fight against human trafficking, because they facilitate monitoring and analyzing the market. Shutting down these sites will not even make a dent in the demand for prositution. It will simply drive that demand elsewhere, to underground sites or ones outside of FBI jurisdiction.<p>This is a loss for human trafficking victims. By pushing this business further underground, the FBI loses some monitoring and detection ability, traffickers are likely angry, and victims lose the benefit of client accountability on sites like Myredbook. This shutdown will not affect the supply of, or demand for, human trafficking victims. It will only worsen their situation and further hide it from authorities.<p>But hey, the FBI gets some nice PR pieces about their latest big bust! Yeah! Go team!

It is a major investment on the part of a company to train and get someone up to speed on a piece of business, and one way to mitigate the risk of them leaving is to have them sign a voluntary agreement to not compete for x amount of time.<p>Obviously, this can be abused in situations where employers have the upper hand.  But in many high powered positions where highly qualified people have a lot of leverage against their employer, it could help reduce costs a lot (for the end consumer also, since the risk of someone leaving and taking the business would just raise the prices you have to charge to mitigate that risk, as opposed to a non compete).",1404268375

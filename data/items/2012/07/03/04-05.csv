That works for certain areas, as others have pointed out, but once you start manipulating customer data that they have set up, it crosses a line.<p>I'm a strong believer in confining Windows to a fixed set of resources -- i.e., a VM with fixed memory and disk space.

At best, these patent wars don't help anybody but the lawyers involved. At the worst, either of these companies could crush a startup using what are pretty ubiquitous technologies just because they have a loosely worded patent.<p>It's not about one side looking worse than the other, this is an all out war and these companies will do whatever is necessary to keep their hard worked on products on the market.<p>Perhaps Apple fans do a better job of spreading smut about who is suing who for what, so you say ""Google is losing the PR war about their integrity""<p>But really we are all losing when it comes to innovation and competition.

4192465,comment,4189961,4191475,1,0,phillipnazarian,,,"To address your personal points: I chose my majors because they were what interested me most academically, not because I thought they were easy.  I would probably do better in technical classes to be honest.  I'm also not planning on applying to business school....<p>but more importantly the point about demand for CS specialists: I definitely agree that the reason they are in such high demand is that the barrier to gaining the knowledge and ability to actually code things is much higher.  You can't just pick up coding that easily (thats not to say that more resources are giving people the opportunity to do it outside of traditional school).  At the same time, I think you downplay the importance of non-technical people in making things happen.  They aren't just deal makers, and without them a necessary part is definitely missing.  You can't just gain those skills overnight, but you are certainly right in saying there are many more ways to get these skills than learning a new programming language.  But my real point is that I believe that the technical barriers to putting out a website, app, etc. will be greatly reduced in the next decade or so.  I think the way programming is done will completely be disrupted so that it does not take an ""education [that] is multiples harder than others"" to put a product together.<p>Forgive the crude example, but maybe this will help explain my somewhat ambiguous point.  What i'm trying to say is that, imagine if before telephones there was a huge boom in using morse code as a new way of transferring information at much greater speeds then traditional post.  There would then be a surge (not the same as one that we are currently in) in the demand that people that could understand and use the code (I realize that it isn't super hard to pick up but imagine if it were).  But then with the introduction of the telephone (a new way of communicating) it wasn't necessary to depend on people that had the knowledge of the code to get things done.  Effectively a way was found the bypass the technical barriers preventing anyone from entering.  I imagine a similar thing happening with computer programing, if that makes sense. I probably didn't explain that amazingly, but hopefully it clarifies a little.",1341288562

4192458,comment,4189040,4192395,1,0,cookiecaper,,,">Homosexuality has existed as long as humans, it's all over our recorded, and spoken, history.<p>OK.<p>>The legal problem is mostly about the word ""marriage"" and nothing else. Sure, we could fix everything by changing tons of laws (LOTS and LOTS) - or we could federally re-define marriage and be done with it. Or as a Canadian PM said ""Different but equal is not equal"".<p>Indeed. I do not assert that offering civil unions in lieu of marriage represents an equivocation between heterosexual and homosexual coupling. This is precisely why people find the option of civil unions more agreeable -- it doesn't equivocate the relationship.<p>>An adopted child with two loving dads or moms is better than an institutionalized child with the state raising them.<p>I'm not sure this is self-evident, but obviously nobody wants children to have to be institutionalized either. If we have the option of adopting a child to a homosexual couple now or a heterosexual couple later, I believe the child will be better off with the heterosexual couple. It is our responsibility to ensure we give wards of the state over to a healthy home environment; in my opinion, same-sex adoptive parentage is an automatic disqualification.<p>>And who says that there is no mommy-type figure in the picture too? You don't know everyone's personal business.<p>Mommy-type figures function differently than natural mothers or permanent adoptive live-in mothers. It is possible that a mother figure like the latter would exist, but not likely or common. Do you suggest we allow gay couples to adopt only if there is a committed permanent live-in woman who can function as a mother-type figure? If so, your hypothetical may be relevant.<p>>And news fella - homosexual women are physically capable of having children, and homosexual men are physically capable of providing their needed bit to get a woman pregnant.<p>This isn't news to me. I was already aware of it, but I suppose it's good to clarify in case someone thinks that one is automatically sterilized when he or she engages in homosexual activity.<p>This is basically semantics. The point I intended, which you probably understood, is that homosexual partners cannot procreate together; i.e., the biological material of two same-sex partners cannot combine to produce offspring, automatically depriving the offspring of at least one biological parent (again, assuming a typical relationship where one couple occupies a single home as an independent family unit) of true ""parentage"" by that parent, even if his/her identity is known and the couple and child remain in contact (which, as I understand it, is not necessarily common). As I said, many do not think this matters anymore because they were similarly deprived or because they know many people who were similarly deprived and ""turned out OK"". While I agree it's not guaranteed to create problems, it's certainly not ideal, and not a condition the government should take special action to encourage.<p>>To your last paragraph - why do we bother to elect lawmakers and have a government if not to make law.<p>They should make law, but not law that serves primarily to impose a certain ideological perspective on an individual. Laws should be made to protect communal life and preserve the communal right and control of property. Anything that does not sufficiently threaten these fundamental principles should be left to individual freedom of conscience. As the function of redefining marriage to include homosexuality is primarily to establish a governmental endorsement on homosexual behavior, it doesn't pass muster.<p>>Plenty of heterosexual couples cannot bear children either - should they not be allowed to marry?<p>No, because a) children aren't the entire basis of my opposition. There is also the question of whether the state wants to encourage homosexual coupling and promote the idea as an acceptable life choice. And b) it's a matter of respect and hope. We rarely know when someone is infertile ahead of marriage, and in the cases where we do, we do not know that the infertility will be impossible to cure over the course of the marriage. Furthermore, even if we are assured fertility will be impossible to restore, we allow the dignity of marriage out of respect for the potential and representation of heterosexual union.",1341288368

In our geographic region? At the price point we can afford?<p>I think this common perspective is a little misguided. Programmers retrain fairly easily, inexpensive recent graduates doubly so. With JVM languages, it's particularly true, because the overall environment is so large compared to the language, and all that comes over for free.<p>I don't really understand the business world's preoccupation with 5 years of experience. My experience has been that some programmers ""get it"" right out of school, others never get it, some continue to improve into their 60s and beyond. Experience levels correlate strongly with desired starting salary, but not with skill or ability to learn.<p>> In 5 years from now is it likely that this is going to be a marginalized technology that we have trouble finding skills for?<p>Lisp was a highly marginalized technology for a few decades there. No doubt you could scour rsums at Monster.com all day and not find anyone who had bothered to put it down. But nobody who actually tried to hire Common Lisp programmers had much difficulty finding them or paying them, because of the prestige. Very few languages seem to enter an actively-hated state (Cobol and Mumps being obvious exceptions); the rest enter disuse and we programmers get all misty-eyed for them.<p>In short, this is one of those ""obvious"" business fears that turns out to be completely irrational.<p>On the flip side, where I work, we use Java 6, JSF 2 and Hibernate: industry standard stuff. Nevertheless, we've been able to fill only one of three open positions in the last three years, after multiple month searches. The size of the labor pool is usually not the limiting factor: in our case, we are in the middle of nowhere and offer below industry standard compensation (though it's very high for the region). Where you are, what you pay, what the benefits are like, what you work on; these kinds of things are going to have a much more dramatic effect on your ability to find developers than simply choosing an off-beat language.

Everyone heaps platitudes on Jobs but the reality is he has no understanding of or interest in business needs.  On the other hand, you can make an argument that Ballmer has performed quite well on this front.<p>The simple fact is that it may be impossible to reconcile the different business styles needed to succeed in both the consumer space and the business space.

So I think that in many cases an hourly rate makes more sense for the coder and the project creator.<p>For medium sized projects around $2-10k maybe 20k, then project based work makes sense. Larger than this and a fixed fee is dangerous for the coder. Plus managing the timing of when the coder is paid is difficult.<p>And yes in most cases if the coder is great, a genuine coder will want an ongoing relationship with the employer.<p>Also I think it is possible to achieve the same result as your site by using vworker for example but only picking coders with VERY good feedback (the top 200 coders on the web site for example).<p>Another potential problem is how to you weed out all of the bad coders?

The most obvious problem is that it can't rotate; the app only runs in vertical mode.  The first page it brings you to is the login page; you flip your phone open to get at the keyboard, and the app doesn't rotate.  I've never seen that before, anywhere.  The rest of the app is the same way; all vertical.<p>Different screens seem to have trouble refreshing, also.  The search screen, for example, sometimes won't show search results when you search.  Instead, it sends you back to the home screen after searching.  You can flip back to the search screen, and your results are there, so it's working, but just in an amusingly buggy manner.<p>Aside from the obvious UI bugs, the actual core functionality (streaming Netflix) seems pretty solid.  I haven't played with it much, and since my phone (G2) doesn't have HDMI out I'm not sure how much I will use it, but it seems to fulfill its core purpose pretty well.

Presumably that information is worth something, and I think there is a good argument to be made that the value of that information is equivalent to the profit of all the arbitrageurs.<p>I believe in wealth redistribution, but this question is less about inequality and more about the utility of that advance information.<p>Intuitively it does seem ridiculous that 3ms of ping is worth $300,000,000.

2543552,comment,2542495,2542495,1,0,rayiner,,,"I'm not sure these figures are particularly illuminating, for two reasons:<p>1) Many realistic outcomes are obscured by the averages. The average college doesn't lead to very good opportunities, and the average student doesn't work very hard. Working hard at a good school (top 50) or even not working that hard at a mediocre school (top 10) can lead to dramatically different results than what might be expected from looking at the results of all students from all ~5,000 or so universities in the country.<p>2) While the use of net present value is technically correct (the best kind of correct!) it's also somewhat misleading. Say a college graduate earns $100,000 more than a high school graduate in the final year of his career. The net present value of that (using the historic S&P 500 return of 7%) is $6,700. Yes, if you're comparing a choice between earning $100k more in the final year of your career with $7,000 right now, the latter is the better choice. However, that is never the choice! A high school graduate cannot get $7,000 in loans to invest in the market at 7% return. So from a practical perspective, using net present value compares against a choice that the graduate doesn't have.<p>It all makes sense when you look at things another way. The student is not making an investment. He is the investment, one the bank is making in him. The investment directly creates real value (as opposed to an investment in the market, which does so only indirectly), so both the bank and the student might come out ahead even if the net present value of the education is <i>less</i> than the amount borrowed to finance it.",1305261208

All of these points are valid, however, I don't think the concept of another bubble should be entirely dismissed.

It is bothersome when a justification algorithm puts too much space between too few words, but that's what hyphenation is for.  To the dyslexics and others who are distracted by the rivers of whitespace that run through justified text, are you never bothered by rivers of whitespace in ragged-right text?",1305260108

You can't blame Ballmer for not driving the stock back up to unrealistic levels.<p>Meanwhile, Google is basically starting from zero - of course it's going to show faster growth than the lumbering behemoth that is MS. Keep in mind that few people outside of  the bank underwriting the IPO and Google employees actually got the awesome starting price.<p>So yes, he should compare them, but no, he's doing it wrong.",1305259787
2543517,comment,2542742,2543104,70,0,alexqgb,,,"@asr - I think the OP's point is a bit more subtle than that. He's not suggesting that MS - a large and mature company - should still be growing like companies that only hit their stride recently. Rather, he's noting the degree to which Apple and Google have dramatically  outperformed the NASDAQ, citing this as an indicator of how much room to grow the tech sector has had in general.<p>The real point is that MS has realized none of this potential. Forget lead, it hasn't even followed. Instead of swiftly copying the wildly successful iPhone, they just mocked it, telling everyone that it was a hopelessly niche product. Likewise, the iPad was being written-off by Ballmer as a pointless device with no appreciable market. In reality, it was busy becoming the most successful consumer electronic product of all time.<p>This goes well beyond a failure of vision. A remark like that indicates total ignorance of present reality. It's a bit like calling Avatar ""a flaming fiasco seen by nobody"" on the same weekend it breaks a billion dollars at the box office. Coming from the head of a major studio, an assessment that poor would be career-ending.<p>If your model is imitating others, fine. But you HAVE to be fundamentally aware of what others are doing if you're going to make it work. So if you're demonstrably clueless about what ""two of the most successful publicly traded tech companies of the period"" are really up to, or why their products are selling so well, you're simply the wrong man for the job.",1305259777

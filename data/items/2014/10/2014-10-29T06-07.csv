Take the statistical tsunami of SportVU in the NBA. “It&#x27;s not an exaggeration to say that 85 percent of the teams don&#x27;t know what to do with this data,” Goldsberry says. “The idea that this is going to revolutionize the NBA—well, I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s true unless teams awaken really quickly to things like machine learning and data visualization.&quot;&quot;",1414565857

If my opinion of javascript is wrong and it really is that bad - I&#x27;d think there would be more of a movement to move away from it.<p>You should watch this <a href=""https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death...</a><p>Programmers can&#x27;t always just start something &quot;new&quot;, they have to work on existing platforms to be able to deploy their software quickly and efficiently. This video explain than even though javascript was never intended to run a 3D engine, it now is able to. As he explains it in the video, it&#x27;s a hack, and it doesn&#x27;t work that well for most binaries.<p>If I could, I would start a new browser, without html, with more dynamic languages, with a clang VM, with protocol buffers, etc. But in this age of patents and market shares in IT, I don&#x27;t expect having enough exposure to have users installing this future browser. If one software company can&#x27;t deploy its app on the dominant systems, it&#x27;s screwed. But it doesn&#x27;t mean JS fits every possible job.",1414565635

8525873,comment,8519801,8520218,0,0,PhantomGremlin,,,"> We have a small pick-and-place machine/etc setup<p>I&#x27;ve been in at the ground floor of a number of successful hardware startups. One of which had a number of pick and place machines, IR reflow ovens, and all sorts of related manufacturing equipment. So I&#x27;m quite familiar with the field.<p>My very simple, very emphatic advice about a &quot;pick-and-place&quot; machine is: NO NO NO NO NO, a thousand times N0!!!<p>Maybe it&#x27;s something you have to do in NZ. But in some other parts of the world, if I blindfolded you and let you stumble around you would probably trip over a pick-and-place machine in about 5 minutes! They&#x27;re everywhere.<p>In other words, unless your primary purpose is to bootstrap yourself into being a contract manufacturer, you have absolutely no business owning your own pick-and-place machine.<p>A design as simple as yours could be manufactured by almost <i>anyone</i> in the world. It&#x27;s so simple that most of them could do it in their sleep.<p>Just contract the manufacturing out and be done with it.<p>Your quixotic effort at stuffing your own boards reminds me of the perhaps apocryphal story of, in the 1970&#x27;s, WDC designing a chipset that was used in the DEC LSI-11 minicomputer.[1] They had a fab, and in one week they could make enough chips for DEC to sell minicomputers for a year. &quot;Okay, the LSI-11 chips are done. Now WTF do we do with this fab for the other 51 weeks of the year???&quot;<p>Yeah, in the old days IC fabs were cheap enough that everyone and his brother owned one. And they had large fixed costs. And unless they were utilized around the clock they lost money.<p>To a large extent stuff like pick-and-place machines are the same. Sure it&#x27;s orders of magnitude cheaper. But still, maybe it takes you a week or two to build some of your boards. What do you do with your equipment for the other 50 weeks of the year? Is that the business you want to be in?<p>Of course, if that <i>is</i> the business you want to be in, then OK.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital#1970s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Digital#1970s</a>",1414564616

In a normal (break-even or mildly inflationary economy) you start with capital that has some amount of value (purchasing power). Time passes as you make the product, and you can sell it at an <i>equal or greater</i> (profit margin) amount which allows you to regain your initial capital investment.<p>That completely breaks in deflation. The value of the money rises ,and yes, this means people are <i>slightly</i> less likely to spend it, but the problem comes when you want to sell your product. Say you invested $100 to make a product with the expectation being able to sell at a 50% profit margin. Except during the time it took to you to make it, money deflated, and the purchasing price of those same starting materials is now $50. Adding in the same 50% profit says your now can only sell your product at $75.<p>The deflation that happens between investing and selling not only eats your profit margin, it can easily eat your ability to recover your initial capital. Investment is ludicrous in an environment like that.<p>So we go with the &quot;worst method possible, except for all the rest&quot;: mild inflation that is hopefully small, manageable, and trivial.",1414564176

Im not sure if the 1400 alums initially flag or what, but even with the 10 partners grading, their odds of finding black swans get worse because black swans don&#x27;t look like winners to most people - they are essentially counter intuitive, crazy ideas that don&#x27;t appeal to the majority in the beginning (or maybe the founders are not Stanford drop outs or ex Googlers, which further sways the majority to give higher grade to what is more obvious.  Thus pushing down more potential black swans below the interview cut off line.<p>So the more partners you have grading a particular startup, the more partners you have trying to cover their asses and not fuck up.  So the safer choices will get more interviews - and safe choices don&#x27;t usually result in black swans.<p>Not sure if I&#x27;m making sense here, but maybe the proof is in the pudding in that some of their biggest wins are Dropbox, Reddit, and Airbnb...all relatively early in YC batches when there were fewer partners making choices.",1414562477

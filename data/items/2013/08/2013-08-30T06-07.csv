Even Fowler&#x27;s article highlights the fact that we don&#x27;t have a shared understanding what the word productivity means: writong quality code, shipping useful products or making money? all of them? It&#x27;s no surprise that there is no numerical measurement that captures a badly-defined concept.<p>In my opinion, we should approach measurement from a different angle: can we learn something useful about our profession by combining different types of measurements. Can we, for example, easily spot a person who is doing what Fowler is calling important supportive work. Can we detect problem categories that easily lead to buggy code and allocate more time for code quality work for tasks and less for those that are known to be more straight-forward.",1377845626

But it gets even worse. Many times, if they run into a problem in the task they just give up and don&#x27;t tell anyone. When you ask them what happened, they give you a blank look and say something like, I couldn&#x27;t open the file. So instead of asking someone for help they spent the next three hours on facebook until a manager noticed. Very frustrating.<p>I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s completely down to a lack of thinking for oneself, and not, say, a stronger desire to be on Facebook than to do one&#x27;s job ;)",1377843165

(I&#x27;m not precisely sure what you mean by first-class type objects here, given the mention of Data.Typeable; concretely, I&#x27;m aware of three monad libraries that offer something like a polymorphic return and I know how two of them do it; one with symbol macros and regular old maps, and one that (in the presently released version) uses a run-monad function that threads through a regular old map. You presumably are thinking of something else; if so, I&#x27;d be glad to know what it is.)<p>> There is no reason that a user-level macro can&#x27;t add enough inference to perform polymorphic returns.<p>Well, if you say so.

This is especially true when it comes to assigning credit or blame.<p>> It&#x27;s hard to deny that white folks - the ones who&#x27;s support was needed to get the CRA passed - were not more interested in MLK&#x27;s message than the Black Panthers and Malcom X.<p>Of course white folks were more interested in the nonviolent civil rights movement than in black nationalism. But if they weren&#x27;t scared as hell of the black nationalists, they wouldn&#x27;t have given enough of a shit to care about <i>anyone</i> seeking to end the oppression of black people. Up until then, white folks were most of all interested in continuing to oppress black folks! That&#x27;s what I mean when I say MLK gave white folks an out. He made it look respectable and noble for them to fold in the face of a black population that was increasingly refusing to accept being oppressed any longer, because he helped them uphold the illusion that nonviolent, democratic change was still possible.

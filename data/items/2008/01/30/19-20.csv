107018,comment,106827,106864,0,0,benmathes,,,"I had a similar thought. Try the sites that the article links too as ""good design"". In nearly every case each site was clearly made by an artist in the worst sense of the word -- The designs didn't map to what the page was trying to do, it was far too cluttered with pageantry, and there was far too much frill.<p>If the article's writer thinks those are the _best_ designs out there, then I suspect the opinions are somewhat limited.",1201723120

The teacher wanted everyone in the class to write something like that 500 times and turn it in the next day.<p>I went home and ran the following program on my Apple IIe:<p><pre><code>  10 FOR X = 1 TO 500\n  20 ?""I will behave myself in class""\n  30 NEXT X\n\n  PR# 2\n  RUN\n</code></pre>\nWith the printer plugged into slot 2 on the machine, this sent the output of the program to the printer.<p>Needless to say the teacher was not impressed the next day, when I handed in several sheets of linefeed printer paper.  I was impressed however.<p>He made me write it by hand about 100 times instead of 500.",1201722113

I think he wrote the language that he himself wanted, but that's not the same thing.  If Arc was only for him, then why release it to the world?  I think what he wants is the best of both worlds -- lots of users, with no support burden.  Eventually, the users won't stand for this, but while Arc is still an infant, it makes a lot of sense.",1201721715

You don't get the right to complain. Nobody does. Nobody has paid a support contract for anyone to include Unicode support on the language.<p>The guy wrote a language for himself.

988351,comment,986100,988140,0,0,catzaa,,,"> My point is that you have no idea what it's like for those who are poor in the US. To claim that they have abundant opportunity is ludicrous. I know this society inside and out, I've got friends at all social levels-- from dirt-poor to three-digit millionaires-- and I know that you're impossibly naive.<p>I think you are being deliberately deceptive. I have friends that went to work in the USA. One worked for a harvesting company and received a good salary. Another did long distance trucking. All of these are “low paying” jobs, yet in the USA they receive excellent salaries.<p>Many people in low paying jobs (such as plumbers) can own their own home – which is unheard of in many countries. The salary for manual labour is incredibly high.<p>> More desirable is a world in which people have the ability to maximize their contributions to society, because they're given the resources necessary to realize their potential.<p>You view someone earning money as a “gift from society”. If someone works or has a business, he owns his own money with no obligation to any other party. A lot of people on the left wants to view individuals as servants of society (as you do).<p>> Everyone pays taxes. Rich people pay more. I have no problem with this.<p>You do not have a problem with this, because you do not fall in the top tax bracket. That is the “not me” phenomenon in action.<p>> They get more out of society;<p>Again, you view any money an individual makes as a gift from society. This is not so. For a voluntary transaction (where there is no coercion) no one owes a third party anything.<p>> The only one of those that's been demonstrated to be a bad idea is the cash payment for having children (which encourages people to have kids they can't support).<p>Free universities tend to be of much worse quality. Two good examples are Germany and Greece. The qualities of Universities in these countries are much lower than countries such as the United States. Greece has the highest number of foreign students studying abroad for its population size.<p>The Basic Income Grant causes a lot of people to work and places an incredibly high burden on tax payers. In my country they want to introduce the basic income grant. Currently there are 13 million people on welfare (child grants which stretches until a child is 16, unemployment,) while there are only 3 million tax payers (i.e. four people getting grants for every one person on tax). BIG will push it to ten people receiving grants for every one person paying tax.",1260473437

Perhaps it's just their page.. Anyone know if it really supports IE? (I'm aware excanvas is required).<p>[edit] As an addendum, it's nice to see this library hosted on github where myself and others have a chance to easily contribute changes and patches, mix/match/etc each others forks and such. I really wanted to see changes and contributions to the Flot library flow a bit faster (eg: there's a bug in series drop shadows that's had a patch on the mailing list for over a month with no interest from the maintainers in fixing it). I've asked the project owners if they'd be willing to move from Google Code to github to allow for more this, but got a reply implying that most users of Flot are not sophisticated enough to contribute.

The only comment by a farmer I saw was a (great) grass-fed beef producer lamenting the quality of mass-produced grain-fed beef.  I'm quite certain he happily eats the products that he produces.<p>I deal with a lot of conventional and organic growers.  While I'm sure that they exist somewhere, I've yet to run across a farmer who wouldn't eat what he produces.<p>OK, reading closer I guess you are right if you're willing to go on hearsay.  A representative of the National Organics Standards Board is quoted as having talked to potato farmers who say they wouldn't eat what they sell.

Possibly a main reason they haven't taken your money is that they realize that there is very good chance that they'll lose it all and have nothing to show at the end.

1468110,comment,1467017,1467773,0,0,samd,,,"There is nothing inherently wrong with consumption. Any strong economy must have a balance of consumption and savings (investment). Without consumption there is no income for businesses, and without investment there is no growth of businesses. Depending on the economic situation it can be beneficial for the government/Fed to either encourage increased consumption or investment. Giving poor people money is an excellent way to increase consumption because poor people tend to spend most of their income rather than save. In our current economic situation, with consumers cutting spending and thus causing businesses to cut production and jobs, giving away money to poor people would help to increase consumption and thus put people back to work. This is why government's around the world passed stimulus packages in the wake of the financial crisis. So don't demonize people for spending money, it's an essential part of our economy.",1277736942

The lower the better. Spending time on anything other than the startup is bad. Dishwasher or other salaries in Vienna are not particularly relevant to understand this principle. Therefore, the UK and Ireland are better places to start a startup than continental Europe.<p>b) If a significant part of the cost of starting a business comes from mandatory contributions to something I don't want and will never consume (i.e pensions), I get annoyed. You may not know that half of those 250 euros go into pensions and not health care. I want the health care part but I don't want to be forced into a pensions scheme. All contributions should be a share of the income people generate, not a set minimum fee. I have no idea whether that is socialist or not.<p>c) I'm not as anti-socialist as you might think. My opinion is that society needs to catch people who fall, for practical reasons as well as human dignity. Some things like health care, basic shelter and access to information need to be available to everyone. I don't believe that abject poverty makes people more entrepreneural. The biographies of successful people just don't support that claim. I am willing to pay a share of my income to cover the cost of helping those who cannot help themselves. Unfortunately, in Europe, the people who are best protected by this odd form of socialism are not the ones who have fallen but rather those close to government and traditional trade unions. They don't just cause unnecessary cost, they also create very inflexible rules that discourage self-employment and make it very expensive to hire people.<p>Having said that, I totally agree with you that none of that should deter anyone from starting a business wherever they may be.",1277736302

So, in those areas you don't ""find the search for truth."" When the OP talks about math vs. human language (all other contexts?), he appears to imply that in math it is possible to search for truth, but in ""human language"", there is no possibility of finding truth. So, what I meant was roughly this (the following is a reconstruction of the OP's argument, as I understand it, not my views):<p>1. In math, where there is ""a fixed set of consistent rules"" (his words), you can meaningfully search for truth.<p>2. In ""human language"", which ""is not a formal system with complete rules and non-contradictions"" (his words), you cannot meaningfully search for truth.<p>3. The phrase ""mutual understanding"" indicates a second-best option (since the search for truth is ruled out) for ""human language"". As you and I talk - now for instance - we cannot usefully search for truth, but we can at least try to figure out what the other person intends to say. That's ""mutual understanding,"" and I think you can see why it's only a consolation prize compared with the search for truth.<p>The whole thing reminds me a bit of a certain kind of logical positivism. Only some statements are even potentially truth-evaluable. (For example 'x = x' is truth evaluable.) All the rest is simply an expression of personal belief, attitude, disposition or emotion. Under that view, if I say ""action x is always wrong"" and someone else says ""under some circumstances action x is not wrong"", the best we can do is figure out what the other person means by their statement. But there is no possibility of saying whether either of those statements is true or false, since such statements are (by definition) not truth-evaluable.

What service best meets this features set?<p>1) Ability to collect digital media metadata, regardless of where it is being hosted<p>The service needn't be, in fact shouldn't be, a hosting provider, but toolsets for creating, collecting, and managing media metadata found on existing hosting providers, linked to and embedded in the service. This should work for media objects which have discrete, generally static containers, such as video, images, and audio.<p>In the future, to ensure data durability, the content storage could take place on a distributed, peer-to-peer filesystem with intelligent routing and caching algorithms.<p>2) Robust media navigation interfaces, running on a skinning engine<p>A default interface for browsing found media which is useful and fast, including features such as infinite page scrolling, resizeable image thumbnails, content type filters, object scaling, image slideshows, audio/video queuing and playback. No interface is ever perfect or complete, so having a marketplace where designers can submit and users can select their current skin of choice would address most use needs.<p>Facebook, YouTube, and Flickr all recently updated their interfaces. Are they better than before? Maybe, maybe not. Maybe after a learning curve. Maybe for some users, not for others. Maybe for some cases, not for others. And, this wasn't the first interface reboot, and it won't be the last. For lack of a skinning engine, interface designers for services usually end up appealing to the common denominator of their audience.

I wrote: ""If I needed a different library, I'd have edited project.clj to include the dependency."" Let me explain that in detail:<p>lein generates the following default project.clj:<p><pre><code>    (defproject myproj ""1.0.0-SNAPSHOT""\n      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure ""1.1.0""]\n                     [org.clojure/clojure-contrib ""1.1.0""]])\n</code></pre>\nThen you change it to:<p><pre><code>    (defproject myproj ""1.0.0-SNAPSHOT""\n      :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure ""1.1.0""]\n                     [org.clojure/clojure-contrib ""1.1.0""]\n                     [mysql/mysql-connector-java ""5.1.13""]])\n</code></pre>\nTo wit: you add a dependency by including it in the :dependencies vector. For example, Berkeley DB JE would be [com.sleepycat/je ""4.0.92""]. Then you run ""lein deps"", which takes care of the rest.<p>I hope you aren't arguing that editing a text file to include a dependency is too difficult, so I'll address your other point: the Clojure site does not mention Leiningen. There's actually a good reason for it: it is not a core necessity for using the language; you don't have to use Leiningen to use Clojure. If you understand the classpath, you don't really need it. Leiningen is a convenience, not a necessity of life.<p>I'll readily agree that an overview of available development aids would make for a nice addition to clojure.org. No definitive ""Beginner's Guide to Programming in Clojure"" exists. It would ideally explain how to get started at the REPL, how to use SLIME and swank-clojure to work with Emacs, and how to use VimClojure to work with vi, how to handle packaging, and how to deal with dependencies. It would also explain why and how someone might want to use Ant, Maven, Ivy, Leiningen, and the clojars.org repository. I'm sure that someone will write this guide some day soon.",1277734688

1467966,comment,1467832,1467832,0,0,jeb,,,"I've been in a temporary situation where I faced many of the issues I think poor people face. What happens when you are that poor is that you realise the huge mountain above you that you have to overcome to going back to where normal people are, and you just kind of accept where you are now and potter along and try to survive everyday without considering all too much how to get out.<p>For example, I had $4000 debt. There was no way in hell I could ever pay that money back, considering that I made $900/month which did not cover my monthly expenses. So let's say a month ends where I spend $800 and only have $100 left. Am I going to stick it towards paying off the debt or just buy some new shoes or so? That debt is so huge that I know that saving $100 will still take me so many years, that I just accept the debt and go buy myself some shoes.<p>Poverty starts when you resign yourself to being poor. A friend of mine is poor - I called him to lunch and brought out $5000 and I told him that if he can think of any idea at all for a business, I would invest these $5000 in his business. I would not check his idea, I would not bother him if it was viable, I would simply give him the money.<p>Up until today, he has not come to me to pick up the cash. But he still complains about how he has no money. That's the thing - he is resigned to being poor. Becoming rich will mean a lot of work, it's an ardous and long task, and I really don't think he wants to do it, even when the money is offered to him in that manner.",1277734528
1467965,comment,1467528,1467772,0,0,cia_plant,,,"I guess my question was very vague. Let me be more specific.<p>When people talk about causes, they can mean a few different things. For example, if someone is crossing the street at a walk signal, and is hit by a drunk driver, we tend to say that the drunk driver caused the accident.  The accident could have been prevented if the pedestrian had been more careful, perhaps, but he was generally justified in crossing at a walk signal. The driver, on the other hand, was doing something unexpected and dangerous. So in this sort of situation, we can point to a cause.<p>Then again, there are other accidents where there is no single cause. If you ask what caused Chernobyl, you could answer that it was caused by bad reactor design; or by failing to follow safety protocols; or by running a dangerous experiment; and, from what I've read about the accident, all of these explanations would be somewhat correct.  All of these actions were reckless, and the absence of any one of them could have prevented the accident.  So with Chernobyl, there are many independent factors which collide in an unpredictable way to create a catastrophe.<p>Yet again, there are systems like the weather.  If you want to know why it's raining, you can point to particular things that happened recently - like moisture moving in from the pacific or what have you.  Each event that occurs has some proximate causes.  But overall, the weather is chaotic and unpredictable.  There's not really any way to analyze it into overall causes - the best we can do, long term, is the ultimate forecase of the 'hippy dippy weatherman': 'the weather will continue to change, on and off, for a long, long time'<p>So, for me, right now, the economy is pretty much like the weather.  There are highs and lows, and each one has its particular characteristics, but I can't see an overall system to it.  I'd love to have a level of understanding where it is more like the driving accident: I could point to the particular asshole who caused the mess.  If that's not possible, I'd at least like to have a Chernobyl level of understanding, where I have some sense of what mistakes were made.<p>So anyway, I guess I've read some pieces of the story from a few different sources, and they all give a fairly plausible story of how A preceded B, and ~A would have prevented B.  Some of these are: deregulation, low interest rates, government interference in the housing market, bad modeling of risk on the part of finance firms and credit agencies, capitalism itself.  I have a little bit of an understanding of each of these stories.  But I'm still confused over which of these could be considered independent causes.  For example, if the financiers somehow <i>needed</i> to find a place to put their money, then it may have been a <i>consequence</i> that they came up with risk models which drastically underestimated the risk of certain products.<p>So, what I'd like to know is, how did low interest rates lead specifically to this housing-led finance bubble?  Were the other factors coincidental, or forced?<p>I hadn't ever heard that borrowing was actually below the rate of inflation - so that's very interesting to me.  But then, why didn't the bankers just borrow money and put it into treasury bonds or the stock market?  Why build up this house of cards with subprime mortgages and mortgage-backed securities and whatever else?<p>Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions. I'll also look into Schiff later (I don't really like video, but I'll see if my library has one of his books).",1277734472

I understand their reasoning but it is simply too big an obstacle if you just want to check a CL out.<p>I do suggest picking a CL implementation with Readline support on the REPL and that usually means CLISP (<a href=""http://www.clisp.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.clisp.org/</a>) since it offers just that on the most platforms without a hassle.  Then you can just edit ""whatever.lisp"" in your favourite editor and go through the command history for reloading, evalling, etc.<p>You can even skip the Readline support and pick other implementations and just start your script from the commandline.  Just check the commandline options and CLISP even has #!/usr/bin/clisp (hashbang?) support.<p>So you can do a hello world in an IDE independent fashion.

While everyone is clamoring for goal-line refs or technical solutions, he proposes changing the rules somehow to enable more scoring, which would reduce the consequences of wrongfully allowed or disallowed goals.<p>I've always wondered what the game would be like if you simplified it even more and removed goal keepers, so that no player on the field could touch the ball with their hands.  Replace goalies with another defender, or not.<p>That would likely open up scoring, as long-range shots would have a realistic chance to score, and short-range shots would be almost guaranteed if they were on-goal.<p>I'm sure there would be cons as well, but can't think what they might be.<p>Edit: One con would be more breaks in play, though they could probably mitigate that by allowing the scored-on team to restart with a quick goal-kick instead of a center kick-off.  Center kick-offs often end up pushed back to the defensive line anyway, to open up the other team.",1277733624

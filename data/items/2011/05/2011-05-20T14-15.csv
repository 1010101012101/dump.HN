Amongst other things they also provide the option to download torrent files and convert them into mp4, just like fetch.io.<p>For me there are several benefits with using a service like this over downloading the file directly:<p>* I can start a download, close my laptop and go to a different location or bring it to lecture or what not, and the download continues.<p>* If my laptop is in for service I can download and stream a show on my iPad.<p>* It is just extremely fast. Downloading a torrent to put.io and then streaming it is in my experience much faster than downloading the torrent directly to my computer.<p>[edit: fixed formatting]",1305903589

2567905,comment,2567487,2567487,10,0,ja27,,,"Over the year I average $30 a month - but only with about 30 minutes of work a month. It's sad, but I bet I spend more time checking on that income than I do making it. These are mostly old learning experiences and playgrounds for me and I rarely update them.<p>60% is from Adsense on a sports-related niche website. I make most of that during a couple bursts related to sports seasons - playoffs, spring training, opening day, March Madness, etc. I absolutely stumbled upon that niche from seeing traffic on a related blog post I made. If I really did the SEO and worked on the site I could probably make 5-10 times as much, but I couldn't really grow to other niches.<p>39% of that is from Amazon affiliate links on a niche gift shopping site. That occasionally lands a sale throughout the year, but it booms from October to early December. This is something I could easily grow to lots of other niches - if I built out the automation. It doesn't really excite me, but shoveling Amazon affiliate links onto dozens or hundreds of niche shopping blogs should be lucrative. I would only focus on the Christmas shopping season though, unless you targeted different holidays like Mother's Day.<p>1% of that is from a few photos on iStockPhoto. That's where I actually want to put more of my effort going forward. I like the challenge of taking good photos and I like the idea of making my photography hobby self-supporting. But I also think the stock photography (and video) I produce will have a longer sellable life than anything else.",1305903559

Plus exercise and meditation. Both work and they are on opposite sides of the fat/no-fat spectrum.<p>(My own experience is that cardiologists are eager to recommend the Ornish diet and don't really believe the studies favoring the Atkins diet. Doctors are people.

2567847,comment,2567578,2567665,12,0,spjwebster,,,"Indeed. Also, a slightly more succinct fix for IE6/7 would be:<p><pre><code>  function foo(element, a, b) {
    element.onclick = function() { /* uses a and b */ };
    element = null; // avoid memory leak
  }
</code></pre>
The closure contains a reference to foo's activation object, not to its properties. As a consequence, you can clear out the element reference after the event handler has been defined and this will break the circular reference.<p>The above technique is also useful when creating anonymous functions for other purposes when element references happen to be lying around. Depending on how long these anonymous functions are kept alive and what you do with the elements in the meantime, this would normally lead to a memory leak (due to the dangling reference to the DOM element, rather than a circular reference as described in the article).<p>See <a href=""http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/</a> for a seriously nerdy deep-dive into closures in JavaScript.",1305902778

How are you defining ""success""?<p>If you define success by its ability to run in obscure places, then sure, any change which limits this is going to cause GNOME to be a ""failure"".  But that's not the only definition of ""success"" and ""failure"".  Personally, I think the ability to run GNOME on obscure operating systems isn't all that interesting.  For similar reasons, it really isn't impressive to me that NetBSD can run on ancient Amiga hardware.  And in, fact, NetBSD's obsession of supporting legacy hardware slowed down their ability to run on modern hardware, I'd consider it bad and a direct cause of their  ""failure"" in terms of market share as compared to say, Linux.<p>There's a similar issue going on here with GNOME and obscure/irrelevant operating systems.  If that slows them down, then they should (IMHO) figure ways of not slowing them down.  And in fact, it's not a complete abandonment of those lesser/legacy systems.  There would be cut down systemd releases that would support what ever limited functionality that might be provided by that operating system.  If Solaris doesn't have cgroups to provide resource isolation, then there's not much GNOME or the systemd/Solaris adapter layer can do to ameliorate the situation.",1305901372

One wonders, if this mind, one of the greatest (if not <i>the</i>) mind in history, would have achieved if he had focused all his energy on science.<p>Similar thing happened to Blaise Pascal: After his conversion (due to a accident where he nearly died) he stopped all his mathematical activities, except for <i>one</i> night when, to dull the pain of a toothache, he returned, and <i>almost invented calculus</i>!<p>So, when making fun of all the fundamentalists getting ready for Rapture, etc., bear in mind that the ""deadly loop"" of religion can hold even the greatest.<p>Here's Marvin Minsky's excellent quote on the ""deadly loop"" of religion (<a href=""http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/heroes_and_differences.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.j-paine.org/dobbs/heroes_and_differences.html</a>):<p>After a dinner of take-out dim sum, Minsky, who had been reading the Koran with some dismay at its violent inquiry-blunting formulae, sermonized, ""Religion is a teaching machine  a little deadly loop for putting itself in your mind and keeping it there. The main concern of a religion is to stop thinking, to suppress doubt. It's interested in solving deep problems, not in understanding them. And it's correct in a sense, because the problems it deals with don't have solutions, because they're loops. 'Who made the world?' 'God.' You're not allowed to ask, 'Who made God?' """,1305900483

Whereas your regular self-help book might just wreck your bank account (at the worst), some of the things in this book might do a lot worse things. Yes, they might not, too. But are you willing to take those risks? (Again, the slow-carb diet and the kettlebell workouts are probably amongst the least controversial parts of the book)<p>And yes, I've read the book, most of the ""hacks"" have been done by Tim on himself, sometimes with a with/without methodology. Not really bad and actually something that everyone who modifies his lifestyle should do. But that still doesn't replace blinded studies, never mind that he very rarely states how many ""hacks"" he's been doing at the same time. And never mind that he's been quite athletic for most of his life, so a lot of the techniques won't work that well for your average pudgy nerd.<p>It's not a very expensive book, on the other hand. But if someone buys it, I'd recommend taking everything <i>cum grano salis</i> and do your internet research before embarking on a ""hack"", especially if it means taking supplements (e.g. the bro-sciency ECA stack).",1305900425

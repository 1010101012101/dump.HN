If I could have gotten an OS X machine along the lines of the R500, I would have. I simply prioritize functionality over form.<p>Perhaps Apple drive away buyers like me? Hell, even the mac mini I bought was next to impossible to upgrade. AFAICT, Apple make user-hostile hardware.

6975364,comment,6975237,6975237,1,0,brunorsini,,,"I would frame this slightly differently: &quot;How can I make these emails absolutely delightful to users?&quot; Once you nail this you should make it dead simple for happy users to recommend the service to their friends.<p>As for monetizing the happy and (hopefully) growing base... It won&#x27;t be easy but I would focus on your main strength: unlike most advertisement inventory you have people&#x27;s email addresses, which could give you a good head start on the &quot;who&quot; question.  Maybe you could even ask an optional question or two as part of your sign up process to give you more data on your users, and based on the combined info you get you could write simple scripts to try and extract the most out of each one.<p>For instance: if the user is in a country served by Amazon, suggest a different product you actually really like on each email you send out (shouldn&#x27;t be that much work to curate a basic list of things that caught your fancy). Personally I would make it very explicit that you&#x27;re:<p>- adding an affiliate link to the product, which helps pay for the service in question<p>- you actually do use and like the product (for reasons x, y or z)<p>I would also make it incredibly simple for users to put money in your hat if they choose to.

Allow some simple tagging system for submissions to facilitate this. For instance, recently the entire world was in mourning because Africa&#x27;s greatest ever Freedom Fighter passed away. However, whilst that was going on plenty of other people were celebrating christenings, new births and that sort of thing.<p>Allow people to upvote, add comments, share and so on. Make it searchable/sortable by tags.<p>Also consider music, people like to have a soundtrack to their lives.

6975319,comment,6973336,6974282,1,0,bane,,,"Thanks for the advice. I&#x27;m going to put it to use!<p>Nitpicky issues from Windows:<p>* Registry is an abortion of a bad idea. I remember in Windows 3.x how much better life was dealing with .ini files (if that can be believed). It corrupts all the time, fails in weird ways, has duplicate and triplicate entries for everything and is almost impossible to play around in without risking the entire system.<p>* CMD.exe needs a complete overhaul. I don&#x27;t need a very powerful shell, but I&#x27;d like to use one that wasn&#x27;t a fixed width dos prompt from 1983.<p>* I don&#x27;t ever want to see a defrag utility again. I&#x27;m a firm believer that the more OS utilities there are for something the bigger a problem it is and there are hundreds of defrag utilities for Windows.<p>* I wish the default apps that shipped with Windows were a hair more powerful.<p>* Searching for stuff is molasses slow compared to spotlight. I actually install a utility called &quot;everything&quot; on all my machines that solves 80%-90% of my issues with finding things, but it seems stupid that something of equivalent power and speed isn&#x27;t a built-in app.<p>* OS X exclusive apps. Most of them are forgettable fixes for brokenness in OS X or similar, but there are a few that are simply awesome and don&#x27;t have a good (enough) equivalent in Windows. I was just thinking about this subject the other day with the release of OpenEmu.<p>* System slowdown. Eventually every windows system will slow down to a constant disk grind. There&#x27;s no real explanation for it, you can tend the system as carefully as you want but it will happen. You can defrag as much as you want etc. But before long you&#x27;ll have 10 minute boot times and it sucks. I&#x27;m trying a new approach this go around doing my day-to-day in a virtualized Windows VM and trying to keep my host system &quot;pure&quot; or for only things that require lots of system resources like games or music production. That way when the VM starts to slow down and piss me off I can just jettison it out an airlock.<p>* Multiple workspaces/desktop. I mean <i>common</i>! It&#x27;s <i>so</i> well done in OS X I can&#x27;t believe there isn&#x27;t even a basic version of this in Windows by now.<p>* I hate the libraries, my documents &quot;here&#x27;s how to organize your shit into folder&quot; noise. I&#x27;ve avoided it since XP and haven&#x27;t ever been disappointed I did so.<p>* I hate how various programs will just create folders in my documents<p>* The installation stuff it messed up and I hate how uninstalling software leaves bits of it all over the system. I can&#x27;t believe that this isn&#x27;t better sandboxed by now. For a while I used to use sandboxie to solve this, but it got annoying enough that I&#x27;ve just solved it with VMs now.<p>* hiding file extension, in favor of just showing them in another column is an abortion of an idea and I turn on file extension as the first thing I do when I setup a new machine.<p>* windows update loves to restart my machine when I&#x27;m in the middle of doing things. There&#x27;s a fix for it, but I&#x27;ve made a rule not to edit the registry for annoyances.<p>* sticky keys, until I turn it off.<p>* UAC still gets annoying. Especially during startup. Some apps, like Everything, still trigger it when I startup, and it&#x27;s stupid and I want to have an option to stop prompting me about it. There is a resolution, but it&#x27;s so involved that I can&#x27;t be bothered.<p>* right-click context menus either don&#x27;t populate or they get cluttered. I&#x27;ve never been &quot;happy&quot; with what&#x27;s in them and there&#x27;s not a clean way to edit it.",1388248784

A lot of the stuff destroyed was not preserved anywhere else, and is thus, now, lost to the world forever.<p>Since videogame companies are acquired at the same rate as radioactive particles are emitted from an element with a half-life measured in seconds, it&#x27;s very common for a company to go under and for the acquirer to just dump everything in the trash, save for the very non-physical IP rights. I&#x27;ve seen what game companies throw away, and even discovered entirely unpublished, unknown yet finished games ( <a href=\"http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/cpk/cpk.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.atariprotos.com/2600/software/cpk/cpk.htm</a> ) because game companies don&#x27;t care about old assets, only old IP.<p>The next step in this effort is to preserve the source code behind these games, but that&#x27;s a far more difficult proposition, and most of the code that&#x27;s out there was deleted long ago.<p>It&#x27;s our collective cultural heritage. We have a right to preserve it if the original creators or owners can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t. Rather than pick and choose what to save, Jason Scott saves everything. That way, nothing is lost in the cracks of history.",1388248466

It stems from very practical real-world things. For example, if I write an app and calling a system library does something unexpected, I can read the source code to see exactly what is going on.</i><p>I can do the same on my VM inside the Mac for unix software/OS that I deploy on. But I also found it that I never, ever, had to do something like this for my type of development in 15+ years with regards to a system library.<p>><i>OS X and Windows people &#x27;blindly&#x27; rely on the OS for many things, while on Linux, people hack the OS routinely.</i><p>True, but as a higher end (not drivers or embedded) developer (mostly web and some server stuff), I very much enjoy this culture of not mucking around with the OS.",1388246832

It’s a service that randomly draws a photo that the user taken 6 months on instagram and sends it to them via email on a weekly basis. (like the flashback feature, that everpix just to have)<p>questions: 1. what is a likely business model you would use in a pdt like this that only engage with the users once a week via email.<p>Initially, I was thinking of adding ads into the email that I sent. However, I later realised that it is not possible todo that. adsense programme does not permit adsense ad code to be placed in email messages<p>some plans in mind: \n- Advertiser-Supported Email Newsletter - still go for ads, but I would go and find sponsors. Like the sponsored post on iosWeekly or JavaWeekly<p>- Or I try to add features to the emailer. For example. I will add flickr integration and this is a paid service. (but I also understand from many HN reading, that to be a paid service I must really be solving a pain point. (which I think I am, but I’m not sure thou)<p>- Or I would go for open source. Maybe be using gittip service. If there is donation, great. Otherwise I would just let it run, since I using the service myself.<p>What do you think? How would you create a business model around such a product. Love to hear your feedbacks.<p>p/s this is actually my first post on HN and to avoid fellow readers to think that I’m creating an Ask HN question to spam my project url. I did not put project link in the question itself. But if you any of you are interested to find out more so that you can help advise me. The service is here (http://bit.ly/marcusapp)",1388246481

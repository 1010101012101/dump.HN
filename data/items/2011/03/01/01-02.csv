Maybe not for them,\n  >developers who have already committed to this platform and have a stake in it\n</code></pre>\nA quick perusal of the BlackBerry developer forums will show how much this nonsense matters to individuals who have already developed their applications and have a large stake in the platform.  Yes, getting started with BlackBerry is a pain, but the minor errors continue to compound the longer you develop for the devices.  This adds up to an impression of institutional incompetence and leaves one considering whether time spent developing for a BlackBerry device is a waste of effort.<p>It's not as though any of these issues are a surprise to RIM.  Just running a search on their own forums will show the same topics appearing over and over again through the years as developers find themselves bitten by bureaucratic quirks, frustrating quests for direct internet access, or surprises due to poor App World implementation.<p>No, these problems cannot be corrected overnight, but one would think they would be addressed in some manner.  This thread alone gives an example of how RIM's developer-oriented initiatives seem to completely miss the mark:<p><a href=""http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/New-Alliance-Program-a-good-thing-for-developers/m-p/340907/highlight/true#M62467"" rel=""nofollow"">http://supportforums.blackberry.com/t5/Java-Development/New-...</a><p>Android and iPhone have shown the value small and mid-sized developers bring to a platform through quality applications, but RIM remains completely out to lunch on developer support.  It's gotten so bad that RIM has had to offer a free PlayBook just to get developers to bother with the device, and now there's talk of providing Android app compatibility on PlayBook's release to make up for the lack of professional BlackBerry developers addressing the tablet:<p><a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-business-stories/rim-said-planning-to-bring-android-apps-to-playbook/article1903317/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/top-busine...</a><p>Seriously RIM?  Why should I go through the pain of developing a BlackBerry app when spending the same effort developing for Android will give me access to both Android <i>and</i> RIM devices?<p>Should I just abandon the platform now and focus 100% on Android?",1298944100

(The VC involved was far from the valley.)<p>In fact, the partner even resigned from our board during acquisition negotiations, because the squeeze he was attempting, enriching his firm at the expense of other shareholders, wouldn't mesh well with the fiduciary responsibilities of a board member.<p>Some people think using every lever at their disposal to eke out a few extra percent at the last minute proves their business mettle. I suppose they expect â€“ or prefer to guarantee â€“ that this be their last transaction with the others affected.<p>We wound up acquiescing to his demands to avoid ruining the acquisition. And most of us resolved to never do business with him or his firm again.<p>If another acquisition materializes, you may just have to acquiesce and/or play chicken/hardball with this VC â€“Â all the while hiding any internal dissent from the acquirer, so that ultimately it's up to you and your investors whether you walk away from a deal.<p>If he's a bit player at a larger VC firm, you might privately share your concerns with other more senior partners there â€“ which almost always would be a relationship-destroying maneuver, but if the relationship is already kaput, why not?<p>Hardball might involve having your own lawyer find the maximum you can do under the investment agreement without the VC's agreement â€“ asset sales, de facto liquidation, etc. â€“ or find grounds to (credibly threaten to) sue the VC for breaches of various duties.",1298941676

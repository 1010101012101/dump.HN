How can we debug a correlation? Sure we can tune its paramters, we can train it some more to  again show the desired response. But reaching this point we just abandoned knowing how the intrinsic algorithm works in favor to just focussing on the result.<p>Okay - now if we follow this argument - this would lead to: If we simulate the whole brain by simulating the neural network, we won&#x27;t gain any knowlege about the intrinsic workings of the brain. We won&#x27;t find any enlightenment about the innermost algorithm _represented_ by the neural network we call our brain.",1401058366

7797903,comment,7795216,7796184,4,0,redshirtrob,,,"I think there&#x27;s a large difference between copy-paste and what you&#x27;re describing (which I&#x27;ll dub &#x27;manual transcription&#x27;).  I have no formal training in learning or cognition, but I do have quite a bit of personal, anecdotal evidence to suggest that manual transcription is far more useful, from a pedagogical standpoint, than straight copy-paste.<p>Rather than take a boring example from my programming career I&#x27;d rather draw from my brief mathematical studies in college.  In undergrad I was taking a course on Real Analysis.  The course redefined, much more rigorously, certain concepts that I had understood at a much higher level--think the limit, derivatives and the Riemann Integral.  Suffice it to say that these new concepts challenged my understanding of introductory Calculus, and when I was tasked with writing proofs based on the underlying concepts (e.g. neighborhoods), I struggled.<p>In what can only be described as frustration I decided I was going to start copying the proofs over and over.  I repeatedly transcribed half a doze proofs for a few days straight (I did each one a few times each night).  A strange thing happened.  I began to understand the proofs.  By that I mean I started to understand the intuition required to make the transition between each step of the proofs.  At that point I found the material much more accessible.  Reading the book was easier, the lectures made more sense, I could do homework, and consequently I could complete the exams.<p>I like this example because there is no copy-paste alternative.  I had to engage with the material, but I chose to engage at a very mechanical level.  Still, there was something about the process of reading and writing that aided in understanding the material.<p>I don&#x27;t believe you can get that with copy-paste unless you find some other way to engage with the code.",1401058162

7797893,comment,7796126,7796787,3,0,ratsbane,,,"A great book on this subject is <i>The Law of Armed Conflict and International Humanitarian Law in War</i> by Gary Solis (related to nrsolis?)  I think it&#x27;s currently used as a textbook at West Point and other places.  I have a copy here.  Solis is a clear advocate for rules of conduct in war and for the punishment of those who break those rules but he also does not shy away from pointing out the frequent cases when, as you note, guilty soldiers on the winning side escape punishment.  E.g., here is a quote from the book concerning the trial of Ernest Medina, implicated in the My Lai massacre:<p><i>The prosecution urged that Medina knew, or should have known, of the massacre, but, in addition to inciting it, he took no action either to stop it or to subsequently bring to justice those who committed crimes. âEven if he did not personally commit any crimes in My Lai, Medina clearly failed to maintain control over men under his command who were committing scores of them.â42 Despite apparently meeting the von LeebâList standard â knew or should have known â and, for that matter, the Yamashita standard â must have known â Medina was acquitted.43 One civilian nonlawyer who viewed the trial found the case poorly prosecuted.44 Another calls it âa striking example of the extent to which a domestic . . . tribunal will devise a restricted formulation of the superior responsibility doctrine in order to avoid the prosecution of its own nationals.â45 But that ascribes a sinister motive to the court-martial that did not exist.</i> (p.422)<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Law-Armed-Conflict-International/dp/0521870887"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Law-Armed-Conflict-International/d...</a><p>I hope this information is helpful.",1401057986

The Ferengi keep all their wealth in the form of latinum, precisely because it can&#x27;t be replicated. Presumably the only reason they need these credits is to facilitate trade between species; I don&#x27;t remember them ever discussing how the crew get the credits.<p>The replicators&#x27; energy comes from the ship&#x27;s warp engine, the same thing that powers everything else, and from recycled material. They can both convert matter to energy and energy to matter. We know they use the ship&#x27;s energy because when Voyager is stranded with limited fuel, the first thing the captain does is ration replicator usage by the crew, and pick up a chef to start cooking fresh food instead of replicating meals. The energy source for the engine, in turn, was controlled annihilation of matter (deuterium) and antimatter (anti-deuterium). The ships all had Bussard ramscoops with which to collect deuterium from interstellar space for use as fuel -- that was the red part on the front of the nacelles on the Enterprise D in TNG for example.<p>In an episode of ST:DS9, they discuss the fact that the Federation does restrict the ability to replicate dangerous objects like weapons without authorization. Trade in weapons is always implied to be heavily regulated.<p>All that said, most of it is really left to our imaginations. I was hoping Star Trek: Enterprise, the prequel to the rest of the series, would shed some light. Unfortunately it wasted 3/4 of its time on weird time travel plots that could&#x27;ve taken place in any of the series, and only tried to get back to explaining how the Federation came about at the very end... just before being cancelled.",1401056913

There is a tremendous selection pressure going on, constantly.<p>I always chuckle when I read something by some disaffected 19 yr old whining about how girls don&#x27;t like him. And what does he do? He talks about going to the gym. Even if that were to work, how likely is he to stand out among all the other thousands doing the same, some of which are almost certain to be more advantaged than he (genetics, whatever) ?<p>He&#x27;d do better to get a good job and start looking responsible. So few do, that even if he isn&#x27;t perfect at such, he&#x27;d succeed just because he&#x27;s in a seller&#x27;s market (in that niche, at least).<p>> There is a reason big breasts and biceps arouse desire when they logically shouldn&#x27;t.<p>There is. But I contend that this is because of a psychological defect in the human species: we want what other people want. Why do we want this?<p>It&#x27;s advantageous. Let&#x27;s assume that there is a guy called &quot;Bob&quot;. He&#x27;s not very bright, and while he does have his moments where he figures out something clever, these moments happen on a year-to-year basis, rather than a second-to-second basis (or even hour-to-hour). Figuring out what to want is a difficult intellectual problem, with thousands or millions of factors to consider.<p>So if Bob tries to figure this out himself, he will have to expend enormous effort to do so. And even then, he might make the wrong conclusion.<p>He can instead just &quot;want what everyone wants&quot;. This takes minimal effort. You observe what seems to be popular, and want that. And even though it requires very little effort, the results are very, very close to as good as those had he expended enormous effort himself.<p>And so, we want what others want.<p>In small hunter-gatherer societies, this is very optimal. It almost never backfires. But as societies get bigger, this behavior becomes odd very quickly. We get runaway feedback loops in short order.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that the behavior is now disadvantageous... in many scenarios, it works as well as it ever did. So the selection pressure to tamp  this behavior down is lowered or suppressed completely.<p>So, if even a few people want something, with the right timing and the right random events, everyone will start wanting it. The novelty can even help, at first.<p>And everyone else wants it because they thought others did at some point. And as soon as they decided they wanted that thing (gym muscles) they added to the perception of others that this should be desirable. And the more people buy into it, the more extreme the desire becomes... after all, the only way to stand out among all the rest is to be the <i>most</i> X, for whatever X is.<p>The hilarious part though is how sterile this behavior is. None of the people participating in it are particularly successful from a reproductive point of view. Hell, how would they go to the gym if they had a bunch of brats to take care of?",1401056686

By Voyager they had entire starships made up of holograms so who knows?<p>Like a lot of post-scarcity ideas, to me, Star Trek essentially ran on magic. A lot of that had more to do with the necessities of sci-fi on a low budget (the only reason transporters existed, for instance, was to they didn&#x27;t have to spend effects money on shuttlecraft) than thinking hard about actually making it work. It just <i>did.</i> The holodeck, literally, could create self-aware sentient beings if you asked it to. Riker got cloned when a transporter beam reflected off the clouds of a planet or something. The Enterprise got pregnant and had a space baby. That was a thing that happened.<p>No one cared enough about science fictional speculation to actually try fleshing things out, because that would take time, cost money, and potentially mean taking dramatic risks. Rather, they just came up with a new particle, or kind of energy, or swirly whatever, of the week that would defeat the monster, or other swirly whatever, of the week. Now and then they would just drop the ball on some potentially awesome plot points, like the aliens invading from subspace that snatched people out of their beds and did surgery on them (real creepy stuff) or the Ikonian Empire (apparently a big deal, left magic portals everywhere, completely forgotten about) or the parasites mind-controlling certain Federation higher-ups (leading to the only head-explosion in Trek history.)<p>But the truth is, the &quot;science fiction&quot; was just stage dressing for utterly banal drama.

It&#x27;d be better if wikipedia pages reliably told both sides. Then supplement enthusiasts would learn to go to wikipedia first where they might <i>see</i> the medical caveats alongside the info they originally seek.

How much of a paper trail exists is unclear. The relevant people&#x27;s identities are known, however.<p>One other thing I think we should clear up: these rules are usually pretty vague and general. It&#x27;s not like regulation is something that people opt into or out of depending on their personal preferences. Whatever regulations applied to exchanges and markets in Japan would likely have also applied to Mt Gox.<p>The problem with trying to argue that the fix is &quot;regulation&quot; in the abstract is &quot;regulation&quot; isn&#x27;t some singular silver bullet. It&#x27;s a big pile of rules and people who try to enforce those rules, but often those rules aren&#x27;t doing what you think they&#x27;re doing, or they exist to allow punishment rather than prevention, or they&#x27;re somewhat theoretical because they aren&#x27;t reliably enforced. This is why lots of people would dearly love to find a way to build a decentralised exchange: in theory it could be more reliable than a regulated institution.",1401055375

And the &quot;numbers&quot; say that buying and renting homes doesn&#x27;t provide outsized capital returns in relation to other investments over the long-run.  Period.<p>This isn&#x27;t rocket science; the buy/rent decision must be based on many individual factors, most of which relate to the individual housing markets, individual <i>countries</i> (outside of the US, the rest of the world can&#x27;t write-off their mortgage interest, nor do they have 30 year fixed terms at historically low rates), and the current and expected price of money.<p>A house sale is also a negotiation.  Price matters.  There is no &quot;always better to buy&quot;, for in that case the &quot;seller&quot; would always be losing.  Oh, unless house prices go up, always and forever.<p>Why are banks or other financiers lending to you at 3.5%, when they can just buy up property and rent it out for whatever returns you believe you are able to obtain?  Blackstone and others are attempting to do this as we speak.  The outcome is unknown.  What is your competitive advantage?<p>Again, there is no free lunch.  The world is filled with people who think they&#x27;ve found a way to &quot;beat&quot; the market.  Maybe you have, but I doubt it.  Some people can make a living buying properties and renting them out; others will lose their shirts.  A catch-all &quot;X is better than Y&quot; does not exist.  Putting 200k into a house should provide you with a risk-adjusted return similar to putting 200k into the S&P, including imputed rent.",1401055352

But that didn&#x27;t stop Roddenberry and friends. They just assumed that human beings would figure out some way to &quot;compensate&quot; for the physical laws.&quot;\nFrom what I&#x27;ve read, that&#x27;s somewhat of a generous and optimistic view. My understanding was that the transporter was created purely as a money-saving feature, as they didn&#x27;t have the budget to create planetary landing effects on a weekly basis. The Heisenberg compensator circuits were a convenient piece of techno-babble in an attempt to hand-wave the underlying physics problem of transporters away...",1401055206

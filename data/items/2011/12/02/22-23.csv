3306136,comment,3305013,3306096,2,0,groby_b,,,"Based entirely on practical experiences (both learning and teaching several subjects), talent does matter at two points:<p>When you just entered a new field, talent will propel you ahead faster, for a while. (I'd say it's about 5%-10% of the way to mastery, but that's a wild guess).<p>Then, both talented and untalented people need to work equally hard. Maybe the talented ones get ahead slightly faster, but overall it's a level playing field.<p>Then, once you approach mastery (let's say at 93%, for arguments sake), talent becomes important again. Without it, you can work as hard as you want, you will not progress, or you will progress very, very slowly. But even if you are talented, that last step takes _insane_ dedication.<p>I'm not talking about the ""mastery"" level in the 10,000 hour sense. I'm talking about being at the absolute top of your field. Talent determines the upper limit.<p>Which means for most people, having talent or not only matters at the beginning of the journey. (Because few strive to attain absolute mastery)<p>Edit: And I just realized that I could've skipped half of my post by just reading the article :)",1322866790
3306135,comment,3303796,3305382,3,0,tszyn,,,"It is true that artistic expression predates copyright. But isn't it the case that, before copyright, full-time artists either had wealthy patrons (Roman Catholic Church, the nobility) or lived in poverty? Copyright made it possible for an artist to make a living without having a wealthy patron.<p>I don't think we want to go back to a world where artists are funded by rich people because in that world, the rich decide what works get created.<p>Copyright is the only proven way of producing an abundance of art CREATED FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC, not for the Church or some nobleman. Just look at how many books and songs we got in the 20. century. Thousands of consumers each paying a small amount is a fundamentally democratic idea.<p>I think it should be possible for a writer, musician or developer to make money from ACTUAL creative work -- not from concerts, book signings or t-shirts. I don't see why so many people seem to wish for a world in which a hairdresser gets paid for his work, but a composer or software developer gets nothing. Do we really want a system which rewards the creation of tangible products like tables and haircuts, but not the creation of ideas? In the 21. century? Seriously?<p>To those who ask ""why create artificial scarcity?"": For the same reason we have environmental regulations. Environmental regulations also create artificial scarcity. We make it artificially expensive to release CO2 into the air or to fish cod out of the sea above a certain limit. Why? Because this is necessary to ensure continued abundance.<p>Unless someone proposes a better model which enables people to make a living by creating reproducible works, I will remain a (critical) supporter of copyright. In general, I think we should strive to create a system which rewards contributions to our society.",1322866775

In SVN, you cringe: do I manually copy my changes somewhere else and revert? Ugh.<p>In git, you just make another branch from your clean master, do the hotfix, and pull that change into your bug branches at your leisure.

It's international. When a corporation gets to be the size of, say, Universal, their interests are not bound to a specific country. To me, that makes their interests external to America's interests.<p>> I think this is a very broad, gross generalization. Sure, musically-inclined folks will probably still continue to play instruments or write songs as a hobby, even if there weren't a financial incentive.<p>It is a broad generalization to say that artists are fuelled by financial gain.

3306096,comment,3305013,3305013,-1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"Talent is very important. Unfortunately, when you start saying that mere mortals not born with some innate talent for X task are destined to forever be not as good and less successful everyone throws a fit because the reality is that the majority of us just don't have that talent we crave. It implies that those without the talent won't get ahead and that's really upsetting.<p>I'm still on the fence as to whether to lean on the side this post takes or the original study that it's arguing against but I think this whole discussion has a lot to do with something else entirely. Please try to follow my logic here as I think it's am interesting connection.<p>The American Dream. The story we're told about America being a meritocracy and if we just work hard enough we'll all make it. This myth is pounded into all US born citizens from the time we're first enrolled in school and maybe earlier. But unfortunately this isn't true. In America, if you work really hard you'll get whatever crumbs your masters decide to give you. Power is inherited and not earned more often than not and it's rare that someone breaks out of the ranks and really shakes up the system.<p>So when you imply that talent counts more than hard work it shakes you to your core because of the popular belief that you can do anything if you just try hard enough. But what if we're wrong to refute this? What if talent really does matter more? Acknowledging something like this would surely do more to help you overcome that hurdle than trying to disprove it would. It's like the American Dream. Do I bitch about how it isn't fair and try to convince myself it's real or do I accept it and use my newfound understanding to find away around the problem rather than trying to convince myself it doesn't exist.<p>Again, I'm on the fence here but if I were to play devil's advocate and assume talent matters and practice doesn't, wouldn't that line of thought be more helpful?",1322866006

No question there. But the increase in number of people registering multiple names has supported a reduction in price.<p>The actual number of names, (not taking into account putting a dash in one or more places and the fact that there are only a few 1 letter names that aren't blocked and some other stuff) is approx 26 to the 63rd power.<p>1.3909801171074219559097425909479540384265584214249033...  10^89<p>While that's finite it still a huge number of possibilities. (Like ipv6)<p>I have in my hand an invoice dated 1999 (my earliest domain was '96) and the charge is $70 (for two years). Before that if my memory is correct the price was $100 for two years. Before that the price was 0 (yes 0 when there were so few takers).<p>It's a little chicken and egg but the fact that a high volume registrar (like godaddy) registers so many domains allows them to make so little per domain. (Actually that's not entirely true they also make money by selling you things you don't need but that's a entire separate subject.)<p>So the bottom line is this. If you look at the registration activity speculators and non users of domains drive up registration volume greatly. But of the names they register, only a small percentage of those have anyone interested in buying <i>at any price</i>. So in the end the fact that they do what they do drives prices down for everyone.<p>Edit: Although I agree that's little consolation if they have the domain you want.

I'll be happy to see this die.<p>""It's a bloody good system and it's a crying shame to throw it away just because of piracy.""<p>I really don't think it's a good system at all.

3305902,comment,3304847,3305420,1,0,Codayus,,,"Git is very, VERY commonly used in a ""centralised"" manner, so don't worry about that.  Once you're used to git, the overhead of having to commit <i>and</i> push whenever you would have just commited in svn is minimal.  Still, it will always exist - so the question is ""what do you get in exchange""?  There's two major things:<p>First, the two step process lets you perform commits CONSTANTLY on your local repo.  Coming from svn, it may take a little bit to figure out why this is good, but trust me, it is.  In svn you (typically) are careful about checking in half working code into the central repo.  And rightly so; people are (often) relying on the trunk code to be working.  You don't want to break the build, right?  But anyone who has done non-trivial work with svn will, sooner or later, lose some work that wasn't ""ready"" to check in.  In retrospect, it feels kind of weird to have source control that you aren't supposed to use...<p>Second, everyone knows that git has strong support for branching.  But developers used to svn don't always ""get"" is that git has <i>REALLY</i> strong support for branching.  As in, you should be using it.  Right now.  Constantly.  Are you about to start work on a new issue?  Branch.  Got a new idea on how to solve that problem?  Branch.  Unsure if you should branch?  Branch.  Feeling bored?  Branch twice.  Okay, I'm exaggerating a little, but only a little.  You really should be doing everything in branch, because it's very VERY easy to merge, swap branches, pull changes between branches, shelve a branch and start over, stop working on a branch, restart work on a branch, and generally do whatever you want.  Again, anyone who has done non-trivial work with svn will have probably learned that branches are a cunning trap for the unwary - you need to unlearn that.  :)<p>I'm sure there are teams out there using git in a ""truly"" decentralised manner, but in my experience the point of git (and any other dvcs) is actually that it makes a centralised workflow <i>much</i> less painful for the individual devs.",1322863506

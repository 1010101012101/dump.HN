You would want an avionics engineer--so someone who works at Honeywell, Rockwell-Collins, Garmin, etc.<p>If you can access the wiring in the aircraft, especially with the new fly-by-wire stuff, you could cause problems. None of the communications are encrypted (as far as I know), because it's pretty much assumed you can trust what's on the a/c buses. Also, redundancy helps get rid of erroneous data when it only shows up on one bus.<p>I don't know much about ACARS and ADS-B. While it wouldn't surprise me if there were problems, we also tend to notice rogue transmissions in our spectrum. Much more quickly than people realize.",1365703191

They think your best bet is college. I have taken choices other than what my parents thought best, and worked out. Maybe you will too.<p>2) As others said, your startup has a likelihood to fail, or at least you'll encounter some major hurdles on the way. You have to keep that in mind. You might be extremely excited, but do you have user validation?<p>3) College has a lot of benefits outside just the boring education part, and not all of your courses are macroeconomics! (which I did take, and found interesting, but YMMV). Many courses help with basics you might need in the future. Doing things in practise is a great way to learn, only there are some theoretical things you won't come across unless you do some kind of structured course (can be college, Coursera or whatever). In my case, I tend to procrastinate, so college imposed some rules and forced me to study, which I otherwise wouldn't have done on my own. It also opens your mind.<p>4) You'll meet like-minded people and broaden your horizons. Especially if you get into a college you want.<p>That said, I don't know about how it works in the U.S., but you could do a ""year off"", see where your startup leads, and, if it doesn't, get into college a year later. It won't be the end of the world.<p>Something I believe you must do is try to ""fail fast"". Show your startup to the world. Heck, show it here - unless you believe it's a one trick pony we can easily copy, or some other competitive advantage - in that case show it to people you trust, but show your stuff to SOMEONE that will give you feedback. Especially people in your target, and people that don't know you / won't sugar coat it.<p>I'm sure you know about Steve Blank's philosophy, Lean Startups, Pre-totyping, etc. It sounds like it fits to what you're doing.<p>Edit: this is not legal advice :) , I'm 32, never did a startup (yet), work for a boring BigCo, did college and just finished a master's (loved the masters), still have friends from college.",1365703129

Artificially seems to be a justifiable characterization for a number of reasons.<p>1. At least intuitively, raising wages should attract educated/intellectually capable people from other industries domestically. The corporations have already been reprimanded by the DoJ for instituting anti-competitive practices regarding poaching.<p>2. Attracting technical talent from other countries would seem to decrease the supply of talent in those places, which may have relatively less resources than the U.S. to train and retain technically skilled workers; what would be the consequences in the source countries?<p>3. Finally, attracting highly educated workers to a specific 
industry and specific corporations with hefty resources concentrates a relatively/currently inelastic supply of skilled workers. More explicitly stated, the question might be: how much social good/utility does a company like Facebook or LinkedIn really produce and what would be the result of concentrating highly-educated talent there?",1365703115

Single currency, single language, single legal system. No other country comes close. Your new business can reach a scale here that is unreachable outside of US for the same effort.

My current job profile exists a handful of times in Europe.<p>c) I am good in my job, my job exists in US, US companies need people like me - why would you step in between? I will pay (high) taxes immediately, won't hop the border fence or form a gang. I won't depress any wages, I am here to make money and live in the Bay Area, which is freaking expensive.<p>What I don't get anyhow - White Americans are in the minority in IT anyhow.

Limiting public costs associated with immigration (including, by not limited to, protecting American workers) by limiting the overall level of immigration,
2. Using family bonds to promote national identity by encouraging family-based immigration,
3. Advancing the interest of firms in America by permitting temporary (both long- and short-term) use of foreign, non-immigrant labor (including encouraging long-term foreign labor by allowing, but not requiring, long-term workers to apply for immigrant status.)

Per the article, Alice doesn't want to leak any information about the solution. Simply using a one way function allows Bob to check if one of a possible set of solutions is valid. ( He can just evaluate f on the finite set of answers). It also can leak a bunch of other information, provided it doesn't give the solution in its entirety. For example, f(x) =x^2 mod N is a one way function if factoring is hard. However, it's only hard to learn some log(log(N)) bits of X, the rest is believed to be easy ( and know to be for certain bits).<p>What Alice wants is a commitment scheme[0] which has some secret randomized input. She would commit to her solution, send it to Bob, wait until Bob has solved the puzzle or gives up, and then prove that she had the solution first by providing both the solution and the randomness.  Now you can construct a commitment scheme from a one way function, but a one way function is not a commitment scheme.<p>Now if they both just want to check if they have the same solution, you have to do far more complex than either of these involving Secure Multi Party Computation.

The total number of immigrants allowed each year is 700,000. Not every immigrants counts towards this, though. The biggest exception is family members of current US citizens/greencard holders. There are other exceptions.<p>It is broken because the US does not allow everyone who want to immigrate to do so. There isn't a perfectly fair way to decide who gets to come and who doesn't. Since there are always more people who want to come, than can actually come, the problem keeps getting worse. However, allowing everyone would also create tons of problems (eg a country could pay to send every poor person in their country to the US). Basically, this is one of those cases where all you can do is choose the least shitty solution.<p>The system got so broken due to racism. The original immigration policy was anyone not sick was admitted. Yes, even criminals. Prior to the early 1900's, the only people (voluntarily) immigrating to america were western europeans. Even so, racism was a problem. When the Irish and the Germans (both, predominately Catholic) came over in the 1830's and 1840's, the predominately Protestant English country threw a shit-fit (eg ""help wanted, but not from paddy, inquire within""). By 1870 (ie one generation) no one cared and the Irish and germans were fully part of america. As an aside, the immigration boom in turn caused an economic boom as well.<p>In the early 1900's, another immigration boom began, this time by eastern europeans, jews, and italians. This did not sit well with the predominately western european america, especially with the irish and the germans (yes, they really forgot about the shit they went through in just a couple generations). So a law was passed limiting immigration to 3% of the number of people from that country who were already living in the United States in 1890, [1]. By the way, 1890 just happened to be before the new wave of immigration started. This had the practical effect of allowing just about anyone from western europe who wanted to emmigrate to immigrate, while denying just about everyone else. This stayed in effect until 1965, when a new law was passed, which ""replacing [the old law] with a preference system that focused on immigrants' skills and family relationships with citizens or U.S. residents. Numerical restrictions on visas were set at 170,000 per year, with a per-country-of-origin quota, not including immediate relatives of U.S. citizens, nor ""special immigrants"" (including those born in ""independent"" nations in the Western Hemisphere, former citizens, ministers, and employees of the U.S. government abroad),"" [2]. Basically, the law became slightly less racist. By 1990, the number of immigrants allowed was 700,000.<p>Here's some more links related to immigration law in the US:

Regulation from the top is one way to approach this problem, which is neither perfectly effective (ref. your links) nor free of negative side effects. No solution is perfect, including the voluntary inspections I'm talking about. My point is merely that there are other reasons to distrust regulation as a one-stop solution for all food problems, as seemed to be the contention of the parent of my original post.<p>The government inspectors and agencies are just people, just like any other inspection agency would be. As such, they are subject to the same sets of errors and failures. They are likely neither more nor less effective than a private counterpart playing the same role would be. What I'm attempting to advocate is that consumers should have a say in <i>what</i> is being inspected, and how, and by whom, and that I think the best way to accomplish that is through a diverse, voluntary inspection program with labeling requirements. If you believe that is ""incredibly naive"" that's okay with me.

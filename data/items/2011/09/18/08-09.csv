I care about the karma insofar as it reflects the sentiments of the community.  I used to cross-reference duplicates of the same story because I thought it added value for people to see the different points of view from the different sources, and it helped avoid getting a split discussion with the same points made over and over and over again.<p>It became clear from the down votes that the community as a whole didn't want that, so I stopped.  On the rare occasions I think it's worthwhile to put such a cross-reference I'm always a bit sensitive to the reaction.  I've always tried to be a useful member of the community and not simply say ""screw 'em.""<p>My attitude is changing.<p>I'll say no more.  It was meta-discussion like this that got me a deal of hate last time. If you want to say more, email me.",1316336235

3009821,comment,3005365,3009684,3,0,philwelch,,,"There are two secrets to this. One is that you don't actually need to wash your hair every day. The other is that masculine long hair styles are trivial.<p>Washing your hair every day puts more wear and tear on it, and it's time consuming. If you have short hair, you get away with this because you keep cutting your hair long before it gets worn out. So only once or twice a week will I actually wash my hair (and use conditioner, this actually becomes important with long hair). Most days, I tie it up into a bun before showering so it doesn't get wet. You might be able to find another solution. Depending on your water quality, your hair might smell gross if you just get it wet without washing or at least conditioning it.<p>After showering, I generally brush my hair, especially after washing it or if I want my hair down. If I'm in a hurry or it doesn't look good loose, I just tie it back in a ponytail. There is literally nothing else you have to do to make it look presentable. After a certain length it doesn't really get in your face unless it's especially windy or something. If you want it loose during some sort of physical activity, I've noticed a lot of longhaired footballers will wear a thin black hairband around the base of the skull and the hairline--if you do an image search for Leo Messi or Didier Drogba I'm sure you'll see what I mean.<p>Human hair actually stops growing at a certain point, or to be more precise it grows at the same rate that it gradually falls out over time leaving you with a consistent terminal length. Mine seems to be around the small of my back.<p>As you grow it out between an ordinary short hairstyle and shoulder length, you're likely to look kind of strange for awhile, and have no good way of managing your hair. On male longhair web forums, this period is usually referred to as ""the awkward phase"". You might be tempted to get haircuts so you can at least have a decent medium length style at this point, but really that only makes the awkward phase take longer. From a short hairstyle to shoulder length usually takes within 2 years, but only the middle part of that is likely to be too awkward. From short to shaggy it just kind of looks shaggy, and from almost-shoulder-length to shoulder length it just looks increasingly awesome, but there's a bit of an awkward gap between ""nice and shaggy"" and ""almost shoulder length"" where you can't tie it back, you can't quite keep it all tucked behind your ears, and it gets in your face.<p>One last point--I suspect my hair is naturally very attractive, so I'm certainly not going to guarantee that women will approach you on the street and say they're jealous of your hair if you grow it out. Generally, most styling and hair care above and beyond not cutting it, washing it, conditioning it, and brushing it does more harm than good in the long run. The whole point about barbers saying everyone needs a haircut rings very literally true--hairstylists and hairdressers will suggest a variety of treatments, products, chemicals, cuts, and other solutions to often completely imaginary, self-solving problems like split ends, based upon completely fictional notions about the physiology of hair.<p>And that is certainly more than I ever thought I'd have to say about hair on Hacker News.",1316336189
3009820,comment,3003139,3009355,2,0,dalke,,,"Oh give me a break. 21 states have laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation, and that's what I'm talking about. You can't, under the law in those places, discriminate against someone just because he or she is holding hands, kissing, or even having sex with someone else of the same sex. Your distinction is not relevant, and outside the meaning of the legal definition.<p>The case you bring up - services rendered - is only a part of what it means to discriminate. The Salvation Army says a man who is married to another man cannot be a member of the SA and therefore cannot be employed by the organization. That is discrimination in the workplace, and only legal because religious are except from those laws.<p>Pointing out that the SA will provide soup and compassion to all people, homosexual or otherwise, is irrelevant.",1316336123

If one of these startups manages to get significant market share, what stopping them from building a supply chain down the line (or acquiring someone who has a good one) and using that to tripple profit margins.<p>It sounds to me that these startups are thinking ""lets not waste a lot of money investing in a supply chain (ala webvan)"". The quality of your supply chain might help you drive down costs, but it's going to do little to increase your market share.<p>The marketing and shop-front are the biggest factors that are going to impact market share, so it makes much more sense to focus the investment in those areas and outsource everything else until you're ready to expand.

The state I live in treats chiropractors as one of several kinds of state-licensed healing practitioners, and I think the major health insurance networks here do ""evidence-based"" evaluation of treatments and reimburse for chiropractic treatment of back pain. But there would be no evidence-based reason to reimburse chiropractic treatment for high blood pressure or arthritis or many other things that a chiropractic training program (there is one in my state) might claim that chiropractic treatment can help. In some cases there are public agencies that pay for people's treatments, and it is important that the payers get right which treatments work for which conditions.<p><a href=""http://www.csicop.org/si/2008-01/thyer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csicop.org/si/2008-01/thyer.html</a><p><a href=""http://www.layscience.net/node/566"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.layscience.net/node/566</a><p><a href=""http://www.chirobase.org/01General/message.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chirobase.org/01General/message.html</a><p><a href=""http://medicareupdate.typepad.com/medicare_update/2009/05/medicarechiropractorsoigreport.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://medicareupdate.typepad.com/medicare_update/2009/05/me...</a><p>P.S. to the OP: what's causing the stupid horizontal scrolling of the interesting original post you kindly submitted?

When I was an undergrad I worked for a doomed startup, and I remember with all the various government and other sources of support out there, absolutely noone was willing to pay for rent or food. I mean the money had to specifically be for hardware or the like, but the biggest hurdle is the day to day money. Even living with your parents you need to buy some of your own food.

642608,comment,642254,642538,0,0,lutorm,,,"Just to play this game a little further, the probability is probably (!) smaller, because those meteors are not distributed uniformly across the Earth. Due to the direction of motion of the Earth through space and its sense of rotation, most meteors hit the area that is facing forward in space. That's the area on Earth where it's between midnight and noon, with the maximally forward one at 6am, ie sunrise.<p>Since I suspect, due to the way civilization works, there are more planes flying between noon and midnight than between midnight and noon, and the ones that are flying during that time are mostly intercontinental flights that go preferentially across the pole, there are probably less planes than average where those meteors hit.<p>But now I'm just speculating. ;-)",1244169895

642606,comment,642254,642538,0,0,lutorm,,,"Except that if there are 4000 planes in the sky, that does make (assuming the planes are not overlapping, which seems largely safe) the probability 4000 times larger than for one plane.<p>As long as the planes don't overlap, the <i>flight</i> hours is the correct number to use, because more planes in the sky gives higher probability. It's not the number of meteors that matter, but the number of ""potential meteor strikes"".<p>Equivalently, you can say that the probability of a meteor hitting <i>any one plane</i> at a given time is the fractional area taken up by planes, which if there are 4000 planes in the air is 4000*5.82e-13.

642584,comment,641313,641313,0,0,cagey,,,"[first post; hope it's not over the top or off topic]<p>A Lua testimonial: I've actively used Lua since version 5.1 (current version) was released (has it been 3 years now?).  On Windows (only).  After buying and poring over PiL, 2nd ed, my first trial was to replace an existing commercial scripting language in my text editor.  That was completely successful, and got me up the learning curve.<p>Since then I've adopted it as my scripting language of choice at work, where it has almost totally replaced Perl (my previous choice).<p>* Yes, library support is limited, and lack of native regex support is on rare occasions a pain, but in my line of work these have not been significant handicaps.<p>* As mentioned by others, writing your own Lua functions in C is very approachable.  SWIG?  Who needs it?  I used Perl heavily for years and after reading the docs was scared aware from writing C code to interface to Perl (or Python).  Of course the counterargument is that with those P* languages, you don't _need_ to add much code that can only be written in C.  Touche.<p>* If I had more time on my hands to hack, I could see making Lua the core technology for all sorts of low-level system- and embedded-app development [I was a ""FORTH dreamer"" for years, but Lua realizes a lot of the same dreams that FORTH offered but (for me at least) didn't deliver on].<p>* Since Lua is so tiny, it's easy to incorporate it, full-source-distro plus statically compiled EXE, into a project it's used in.  I do just that, and among the benefits: NO installation needed (I hate installers, and while users expect installers for Windows apps, they don't miss having to run them to get my tools).  Users pull down the Lua EXE (including a few custom/downloaded libraries statically linked in) along with the (non-Lua related) source code they're developing (Lua helps with all aspects of their build process) from SCM, and it's ready to run.  If need be, it can be copied elsewhere and run.  It just works.  I can't imagine doing that with Perl/Python, which are also used by others at work, with the usual install/synchronization issues across dozens of hosts.<p>* I also appreciate that the language's designers have demonstrated a clear commitment to keeping the core language definition as simple as possible.<p>I'm not dissing the P* languages, one of which I loved for years, but it's nice to find a simple tool that isn't lacking in power.  I'll keep using it until a better one comes alone!",1244168383

I actually even relocated because the job description sounded pretty exciting (technically challenging, even), but it ended up being the same sort of thing as the government contracting work that I was trying to escape from, but with even older technology. Since it ended up being largely a software life-support role, I'm working on bootstrapping my own business interests... but my focus isn't on software, it's on photography. I've spent so much time in roles like this one that I'm getting tired of the field altogether, mainly because life-support jobs are so anti-creative.",1212681321

IQ was used to justify the failure of some students relative to others--so the students with a reason why they were allowed to fail did so, and the teachers paid more attention to the students expected to succeed, so that they did so.<p>EF, being a measure of ""mental discipline"" (read: obedience + creativity) separates the students that teachers typically like to teach from those that teachers typically do not.  But the students that teachers like to teach are the ones that they focus on, so those students do well academically.

I&#x27;m not really sure what you are talking about.<p><i>But this is a ludicrous assertion, since the part taxed as labor income is not taxed as capital income.</i><p>This is simple arithmetic. Suppose I&#x27;m paid $100, taxed $20 on labor income. Then I invest the remaining $80, cash out at $90 and pay $2.50 in cap gains. I&#x27;ve then paid another 2.8% (adjusted for NPV).<p>Taxes on capital income always come after labor income, except for certain special tax deferred investment vehicles which treat capital income as equal to labor income.",1436237983

It&#x27;s also not as compact of an encoding as x86, so the code density would be lower; x86, despite being CISC, tends to have more frequently used instructions be shorter, e.g. ~1/4 of the 1-byte opcode map is register-register/register-memory ALU operations.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/macvax/op-codes/VAX-Opcodes-num.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/references/macvax/op-codes/VAX...</a>",1436236960

Two decades of internet experience tells me that very, very, very, very, very few individually targeted threats ever <i>actually</i> get enacted. So yes, you pretend they don&#x27;t happen and don&#x27;t give them the attention they desire.<p>In fact - the police will <i>tell you</i> not to talk about the threat after you report it to them. Discussing the threat gives them an audience, which is what many legitimate psychopaths desire. Someone to &quot;watch their work&quot; after it&#x27;s been done. It&#x27;s better to stay silent and let police investigate (and if they don&#x27;t investigate, chances are they don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a serious threat or there isn&#x27;t anything they can do besides put you under police protection).<p>Also what do you expect individuals to do against an anonymous threat?

It pays off everytime there is a WordPress vulnerability I don&#x27;t have to worry about, and everytime we post an interesting post and I don&#x27;t have to worry about if WordPress is going to fall over (yes, maybe there&#x27;s some caching thing we could have used). It pays off when I have multiple data centers running, because WordPress doesn&#x27;t have the ability to read from a local MySQL slave, so perf on the datacenter far from the master is terrible (the i18n plugin we were using didn&#x27;t help).<p>I imagine the payoff is similar for the stack overflow team as well.<p>EDIT: I don&#x27;t understand why they are using disqus for comments, when they have a self hosted comment platform, in my case we don&#x27;t accept comments.",1436234630

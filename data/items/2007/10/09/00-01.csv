The Second World War was party about resources, in that Hitler wanted lebensraum, and the proximal cause for the USA getting into the war was Imperial Japan's desire for the oil and territory of the Dutch East Indies.  But Japan only wanted to take that because its wars of conquest got it embargoed.  Had it stayed peaceful it could have just bought the oil, a much cheaper prospect.  So, it's more like the oil was an issue because of the war, not the need for oil causing the war.  However, Vietnam, Korea, WWI, the American civil war, and the war for independence... what resouces are you talking about?  <p>",1191891355

Naked people, free flowing booze, drugs and late night parties are more important to media than tech hubs. Hence the difference between Hollywood and Mountain View.<p>	And is there still a place left on earth with any kind of entrepreneurial activity without Indians and Chinese involved? People from those cultures have for centuries spread out all over the world, leaving everything behind to follow trading opportunities. Outside Japan and Korea, their diaspora seem to own pretty much anything worth owning in both Asia and Africa. And quite a bit of America as well. At least from my experience, they seem about the unlikeliest candidates for the 'corporate drone' stereotype one can possibly choose. Once the general population in those countries starts having access to even 1950's level of US higher education spending, there's bound to be a lot of entrepreneurial activity there.\n",1191891240

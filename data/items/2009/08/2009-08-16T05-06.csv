I think it's generally understood that even a diligent individual may have a hard time paying for health care in our system. Basically all this plan is proposing is shifting more tax dollars to subsidize health care like we have it subsidizing the post office.<p>I think there are two primary groups against this: rich people that are financially invested in the current health care system somehow, and middle and sub middle class people who do not believe in people getting ""something for nothing""",1250401551

It is as if they are finding an excuse to start a pissing contest of arguments.<p>I don't think a woman who is a happy and proud 'housewife' (and there are _many_) fits well with the definitions of those feminist fonbois. And about equality: aping men is not equality its lack of self-worth.  Women are different. What their traditional role was was and is respectable too.  The way they were (even now in some regions) treated by society is very deplorable.  The ideal society would certainly be when women are given equal rights and respect.

765706,comment,765435,765655,0,0,mahmud,,,"Allow me first to apologize to pj, he bore the brunt of my harsh out pour against a problem that I have to face on a daily basis. And in the same breath, allow me to express my disinterest in discussing feminism as a movement any further, without the presence of a good representation of its sole subjects, i.e. women. Without a sizeable representation of women in this forum there could never be a good dialogue about feminism (""good"" here being highly subjective.)<p>I say this because I remember the days of the Bush administration, when an inbreeding of ideas and a biased ""discussion"" amongst a gang of highly like minded outsiders delivered the final verdict on the future of ""us"" Muslims, their de facto colonial subjects. I read columns from across the American political ""divide"" everyday, each supporting the last in mutual self-congratulating orgy, each explaining <i>our</i> ""problem"" and proposing very similar ""solutions"" to impose upon us; sometimes threatening, other times sympathetic, but always patronizing and paternalistic in its tone.<p>I never was a feminist, not still (I couldn't be even if I wanted to!) but at least now I understand not to ""think"" for the Other. Women's demand for self-empowerment is an issue squarely in their hands. They could argue amongst themselves all they want, but I as a man have learned better not to offer any unsolicited ""feedback"", having never experienced their condition.<p>Now let me answer you sofal.<p><i>Also, I didn't see any real data on your theory of Arab nations being at half speed because of the lack of women in the work force</i><p>I said above that I was addressing a ""problem that I have to face everyday"". The problems of the Arab world are numerous, but one thing we can both be certain of: the total absence of the female voice from every kind of leadership. Even with the lack of sufficient research and data, I can look across the landscape, or at least my Thunderbird contact list of several hundred executives, and I can't help but wonder if things would have been better with just one woman in their midst.<p>Also, asking for data about the Arab world is akin to sophistry, seeing how half of the nations there are U.S.-sanctioned tyrannies, and the other half are closed despotic regimes that would never allow for unfavorable research to see the light of day (you could do it once, but that's the end of your presence there.) Western ""press"" is safe to ignore the BIG offenders and abusers of human rights, and it can only wiggle its little ""democratic"" tail against a few, hand-selected and Western-approved ""bad guys"".",1250400841

I built the site because I thought my wife would enjoy it, and I thought I would enjoy working on it.  I was wrong on both accounts, so I shut the site down 3 months after it started.  I still think it's a viable idea, I'm just not the person to make it happen.<p>I took a few months off, and mulled different ideas around.  I'm a nurse, so I thought a lot about opportunities in health care IT.  I kept coming around to ""I really don't like health care, and I don't want to work in it"".<p>I bought a list of 50,000 top paying google keywords, and cross referenced it with a google scrape of how many hits per keyword there are.  That gave me a ratio of (top paying keywords)::(# of hits).  I sorted the list by that ratio.<p>There were thousands of items near the top of that list on financial terms.<p>So, during the months after my last project, I traveled visited family, and rolled a lot of this information around in my head.  Two weeks ago I decided to make a social news site devoted to financial news.  Why?  Because 1) I think it's a subject that can hold my attention for several years, and 2)  I think there's a need in the market for news aggregators/filters and 3) I think it can be monetized.<p>Friends and family have both tried to talk me out of the idea and have encouraged me.

We are trying to get out of a world wide economic collapse that was the result of unregulated markets.  At least, that is the general perception.

If you make a mistake buying health insurance, and only discover that your policy does not guarantee you the right to continue purchasing insurance at your existing rate when you are diagnosed with an illness, it could result in bankruptcy or even death.<p>So you understand the hesitancy to trust unregulated market forces when the issue is literally life and death.",1250400051

765688,comment,764855,764855,0,0,DanielStraight,,,"Yes.<p>I buy lots of printed books (and not just for programming). I've probably bought at least a dozen computer books this year alone. I've read several of them cover to cover, substantial portions of several, and used several just for occasional reference. My favorite type of computer books to buy is more theoretical books. Most books to learn a technology are not much better than tutorials online. Reference books don't really beat Google. However, books intended for READING are much better in print. There is no way I would read Code Complete on a computer screen. 800, or however many pages it is, is just way too much not to have paper and ink.<p>Another point for books, you OWN them. Most digital content, you don't really own. If it has any DRM at all of any kind whatsoever, you don't own it. You're leasing it at best. Furthermore, accidental deletion and disk failure are much more likely than your house burning down or flooding to destroy your books. It's even worse if the content lives on someone else's servers. I don't want the availability of my books to be subject to some company's continued existence. If Honda goes out of business, I still have a car. If O'Reilly goes out of business, I should still have my books. There are other ways this comes up. If my internet access goes out, I should still have my books.<p>Another point of books, you can resell or gift them. I bought a computer book recently that I didn't find very useful. I think I got it for like $30 used on Amazon. It's still going for about the same price. So basically I can sell it and have paid nothing for it. Try that with a PDF.<p>Another advantage of books, you can go to a bookstore and browse through them all you want. If you really wanted, you could go to Barnes & Noble, get some coffee, pick up a computer book and read the whole thing there in the store. Sure, some places give previews, but they decide what part of the book the preview comes from and how much you can see. When you're shopping for books, you decide (assuming you're in a store, not on Amazon).",1250399795

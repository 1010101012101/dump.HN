3004450,comment,3003717,3004058,24,0,chernevik,,,"I'm basically an Ayn Rand cultist, and I think the article delivers.  It is now obvious that the CEOs running Lehmans, Bear, and Citibank in 2007 had absolutely no idea of what their assets were or how they were funded.  They were as far outside their ""risk limits"" and ""authorized positions"" as any of these ""rogues"".  But their limits were phrased with far less clarity and with far more wiggle room.  The criminality of these ""rogues"" is defined by their failure to comply with clear and easily adjudicated policies.  No such criminality could be applied to the CEO's deviation from their duties.  The difference between the CEO and the rogue trader isn't in their basic behavior but in the standards that apply to them.<p>That problem cannot be solved by law or policy governing behavior.  The standards applied to these CEOs do not admit of the precise specification needed for clear differentiation between error in judgment, bad luck, malfeasance or dereliction of duty.  Hofstadter talks about the ""computability"" problems addressed by Godel and such, trying to determine which problems are and aren't resolvable by computation.  Governance at that level is a similar kind of problem.<p>The implications of this are profound.  Since we can't legislate / regulate right behavior, we have to motivate it through incentive alignment.  Thirty years ago these banks were partnerships -- if they failed, they wiped out most of the saved capital of their retired partners and senior employees.  You can be very sure those folks were both willing and able to apply the qualitative judgments of risk unavailable to a policy driven review.<p>Those partnerships were converted to publicly held equity because this was less risky for those partners and allowed the companies to achieve larger scale, momentarily conveying cost advantages.  But public equity holders don't, and can't, understand these entities as well as those partners did, and therefore cannot discipline management nearly so well.  The real long-term costs of that dilution in risk management are now more apparent.<p>None of this would be any of my business if banking weren't a necessary component of modern money creation and thus inherently intertwined with the government.  As such, any citizen has a stake and a voice in the stability of these institutions and their role in the creation of money.  The latest regulatory revisions seek to obtain the needed stability by improving the foresight of the regulation, backstopping any failure with an implicit government guarantee on the system.  Since the regulation _cannot_ be improved, we are headed for another bailout at some moment to be determined.  Meanwhile we are essentially underwriting excess compensation for those managers and traders who can figure out the extraction of cash from the system before the equity again falls to zero.<p>There are alternatives.  Each of these institutions should be a lot smaller, so the system can tolerate the collapse of any several.  And they should be generally capitalized by investors who can understand their assets and liabilities, who are in a position to get the confidential information needed to the institution's specific balance sheets, and who _cannot_ hedge or diversify away enough risk to become indifferent to the institution's success.  Publicly traded equity fails on all of those conditions.<p>The consequences of partnership equity are obvious.  It rolls back the scale, and with it the momentary cost advantages, enabled by larger, dumber, indifferent public capital.  Those large institutions managed with integrity (e.g., JP Morgan) will be f*ed.  Capital costs will rise, in part due to induced scale and liquidity inefficiencies, but in part due to the reflection of the real risks of these institutions.  But the policy problems of moral hazard and public subsidy of private speculation will be removed.  We will be spared the logical contortions required to explain away the obvious immorality and idiocy of many of the people running these institutions.  We will avoid the corruption of language and thought that necessarily follows from attempting the impossible task of policing an unspecifiable morality.  Most important, we will remove dangerous political corrosion that follows from associating that intellectual corruption with such extraordinary potential for private gain.<p>tldr; ""Rogues"" differ from CEOs only in the ability to specify position limit violations.  The inability to specify CEO position limits implies that financial stability is unavailable through regulation.  Stability thus only available through alignment of management and equity incentives and knowledge.  The only equity with proper incentive and knowledge would be partnership equity.<p>tldr(tldr;)  CEOs differ from rogues only in the impossibility of specifying their ""position limits"", so CEOs can only be managed by equityholders as knowledgeable and focused as they are -- e.g., partners, not public equity holders.",1316181551

Very clearly explain the penalties for failure to pay:
* After 45 days, I will terminate your service.
* After 60 days, I will turn this over for collection
* etc
Be professional and dispassionate.  If you have a friend or relative who is a lawyer, have them print the letter on their letter head.<p>Emphasize that you've enjoyed working with the client and value your relationship.

3004422,comment,3001783,3001783,1,0,thebany,,,"My husband (a developer who is frequently ""death-marching"" his way through projects) sent me this article yesterday. We are about to have our first child, and it was so cool to read this, especially since we've already been talking about what it's going to be like after our son is born in regards to his work schedule. He also works with West Coasters and is a team leader, which makes things tricky in terms of scheduling meetings and conference calls. Let me just say I so appreciate that this blog post was written and that he came across it. I love that my husband loves his job and is so incredibly talented at it. He is so dedicated to his work and spends way more than 9 hours a day at it (his recent ""early"" bedtime has been 3am consistently, with 6am actually being the most frequent hour he finally lays down to get a minute of shuteye). It's a kind of commitment that I admire, and that I myself have benefitted from. But it's also good to read that his dedication can still be seen, even if he isn't ""death marching"" through coding problems night after night. I do not see this at all as ""parents organizing their lives around their children,"" but rather a parents taking care of and giving priority to all aspects of their lives, especially their children. I think there is so much wisdom in the statements concerning how a person can always get another job, but not just ""get"" another family.<p>Cheers to you and yours and all the hard work you put into all aspects of your life!",1316180987

We had a small infrastructure grant a few years back and cleaned up a bunch of cobwebs that had grown in the runtime, particularly around Windows support, and still support its active use in a few classes. But, it is fairly mature and stable. The only pieces of work I am aware of are some cleanup work related to the integration of the FLINT code generation backend with the frontend and some work we've been doing identifying places where the Definition was vague or the language needs to be extended.<p>MLton is also actively supported, and at this point it is stable and provides extremely high performance for sequential programs (competitive with hand-coded C, though all bets are off if you start cheating and using compiler intrinsics).

Datatypes are so easy to define that it's easy to create intermediate representations (IRs) that enforce static properties of your language. In Manticore, we have four IRs we move through during the compilation process, each of which is easier for certain types of optimizations or follows a set of constraints:<p><a href=""http://manticore-wiki.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php/Image:ManticoreCompilerStages.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manticore-wiki.cs.uchicago.edu/index.php/Image:Mantic...</a><p>For example, in the AST representation, you can still have anything on the right hand side of an ""="". Once you get to BOM, it has been normalized, so every subexpression has a unique variable attached to it. So, ""val x = 1+2<i>y"" is now ""val x'=2</i>y"" and ""val x=1+x'"". This transformation makes identifying common subexpressions trivial.<p>In a compiler written in C, because creating a new set of IR types involves either copying header files or horrible template magic that terribly ties all portions of the compiler together (I've seen people try!), most people end up just keeping one IR and doing passes over it. Some variables are valid at some stages; some are not.<p>A good example is the very nice V8 javascript compiler. I was playing around with it a few months ago, and just understanding what invariants were valid after which phase was challenging.

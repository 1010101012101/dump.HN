265818,comment,265789,265789,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There are editors that remove obviously off-topic posts...but sometimes it takes a while for them to kill stuff.  And lately, the new page is pretty heavy on the spam and off-target links--obviously folks just throwing their site against the Web 2.0 community news wall and hoping something sticks.<p>I'd be content with a maximum of one OP downvote per week, or something.  If it's precious and rare, then I need to really mean it to use it.  Of course, that means that a few downvotes ought to be enough to keep a story off the front page.  I'd also be perfectly content with it having a karma requirement (if you do more than lurk or submit spam, it's impossible not to rack up reasonable karma in a short period of time, so that's a pretty low impact restriction on regular users).",1217807691

I think that with more users, there is simply less consensus on what constitutes signal and what constitutes noise.  A karma threshold for submitting wouldn't help with this.",1217807562

Anyone looking at justin.tv's front page briefly (if, say, they were trying to write a blog post that involved looking at two dozen websites) could be forgiven for thinking it's a youtube clone -- the whole lower half of the page is devoted to pre-recorded videos with lengths in minute-second format.",1217807137

We have written pretty smart algorithm for negotiation and it will be impossible for buyer to know the minimum because it keeps on changing based on demand, requests, popularity, and lot of other factors.<p>So far we are 3 working on this parttime.

265791,comment,265701,265779,0,0,stcredzero,,,"The problem with the ""Tipping Point"" is that we humans have gotten to the point where we could cool the earth if we got desperate enough.  We know from studying volcanoes that injecting large amounts of sulphur particulates into the stratosphere will cool the earth quite effectively.  Any number of industrialized nations could do enough of this to counteract global warming for modest fractions of their GDPs.  There are other materials we could use that would persist higher than the stratosphere and reduce certain negative consequences.<p>Unlike other things we can do about climate change, this is also <i>quick</i>!<p>Of course, the problem with this, is that there are sure to be unintended consequences.  Perhaps this is another sort of ""Tipping Point"" -- where humanity follows a spiral of ever-increasing interventions with unintended consequences that spiral out of control.<p>More important: the ability to manipulate the global climate will have profound geopolitical and strategic ramifications.  These are perhaps just as dangerous as the CO2 tipping point.<p><a href=""http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/david_keith_s_surprising_ideas_on_climate_change.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/david_keith_s_surprising_...</a>",1217805567

Nope, some guy called Andrew Simms from some place called the New Economics Foundation. These are the same guys who made up that ""Happy Planet Index"" which got a bunch of press a few years ago by ranking the countries of the world from best to worst according to various bullshit criteria with carefully tuned weightings (Cuba was fifth, the US was 150th slightly behind Ethiopia and Burkina Faso). The guy is currently billing himself as ""head of the climate change programme at the NEF"", but as far as I can figure out he's also ""director of policy"" and wrote or co-wrote most of their other publications. I can't find any reference to any actual academic qualifications other than the fact that he ""studied at the London School of Economics"".",1217805147

Looks like you're building up the hype well.<p>My 2c after watching the video: I don't understand the instant negotiation. Is there a limit on the number of times I can submit a bid? If not, can't I just start really low and then increment by $1 or $2 until I meet the minimum? If there is a limit, what's stopping me from setting up multiple accounts so that I can discover the minimum, then bid that amount on my legit account? Since this seems to be a major differentiation point, I hope you've ensured there is no easy way to cheat the system ;)<p>Also, how do people pay each other? If you're relying on people to exchange money privately, how are you going to handle disputes?<p>One more thing about the video: your accent. I'd try to get someone without an accent, probably a woman. I think this would appeal more to your target audience.<p>How many people do you have working on this besides you?<p>As far as the Onista site goes, you've done a fantastic job with it. There seems to do and explore and the interface is intuitive and clean.<p>Wish you the best of luck in the coming weeks!<p>Matt",1217804722

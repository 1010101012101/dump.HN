Unfortunately many people don't grasp it. They don't want to think or to learn superior ways if they just can use a language which makes them able to solve their problem. The way to the solution doesn't matter a lot if the solution itself works.<p>Btw the same phenomenon happened with Ada. The Ada 95 language is awesome. I admired it, it was real fun to use it. But average programmers are simply overwhelmed. That's the reason why Ada died.<p>Many people also complain about Unix and Linux but if you take the effort and learn it seriously you will love it.",1324742251

Essentially, one must read the WSDL (treat the WSDL as the documentation) to figure out the data type in Ruby. Even then, what happened if the WSDL has been updated by eBay at some point in the future? more further WSDL-proof-read. Not so in Java, with the help of IDE and compiler, you can easily navigate WSDL objects and detect breaks if WSDL has changed (vial wsdl code-gen).<p>At this point, it seems that using Java is a better option as opposed to Ruby.<p>This is where such research tend to be questionable: ""when all things stay the same...""",1324740871

I've seen no objective evidence that BrainFsck is more challenging for business applications and systems software programming than is Lisp. I invite you to provide clear evidence that it is more challenging.""<p>Leaving that aside though, other people smarter and more experienced with Lisp than I have suggested that this ""problem"" is not unique to Lisp, and may not be a much of a real problem. I really think it's just a question of having good documentation and sensible style which explains what you need to know to use the magic even if it doesn't explain what's underneath. It's true that a lot of ""lone hackers"" aren't going to be writing good (or any!) documentation, but that's not a Lisp problem.<p>Ruby's metamagic is a common example. I already know Ruby and recently I've been learning Rails. I know there's a lot of magic going on behind the scenes, and occasionally I'll read some example or something and know that underneath there's magic that I do not entirely understand. I can continue studying the framework as a user and probably even get away using it for a while without completely understanding the magic underneath. I doubt that every person who has used Rails commercially completely understood every part of the framework that they use, since that would be a huge drag on their ability to ship their thing.<p>Another interesting example: This past week I talked to someone at a nearly pure Scala company and he described this DSL that they wrote (or just use? I can't remember) to interface with SQL databases. It exploited the fact that infix operators are really just methods and that you can define implicit conversions on existing library types that allow you to sort of extend them (I don't actually know Scala, so this may be slightly off base). The snippet of code he showed me, while it looked like Scala, would be turned into an SQL clause. Programmers who use this don't necessarily need to understand all of the gritty details so much as they need to understand what the designer intends and understand the semantics of SQL and of the DSL.<p>In Common Lisp, ""lambda"" is a macro. I don't really know how it works, but I know that it expands into lower level code defining a function and a closure. It's the same way with standard macros (in some Lisps) like let, letrec, cond, if, and, or etc... Most Lisp programmers who are not experts can use them understanding that they are macros but maybe not knowing their complete implementation because they are very well defined (and because they are pretty simple).<p>More complicated macros like ""with-open-file"" can be used by programmers who probably have some idea of how the macro works, but not a complete understanding. As long as your own macros and Lispy magic are documented sufficiently and designed sensibly programmers should be able to use code in your ""world"" without understanding it completely. At least to start.<p>N.B. I haven't used Lisp in a commercial setting, so it's entirely possible all this is bunk and I'm just being naive. Wouldn't be the first time.<p><i>edit</i> Upon re-reading this monster comment I realize it might come across that I'm advocating some kind of ""cargo cult"" or copy-and-paste style of ignorant programming. I'm really not. My point is that while understanding your tools is important, so is knowing when you don't need to peel back the curtain and instead need to address the problem at hand.",1324740226

3388989,comment,3388127,3388552,2,0,RodgerTheGreat,,,"Possibly. I guess the other part that gets me is that you could make the straight-line sequence quite a bit shorter (and with a constant stack footprint) by reordering stack arguments slightly.<p>Their code starts with a value on the stack, primes the unrolled loop and then goes into a series of nested constructs like:<p><pre><code>  DUP X1 =\n  SWAP DUP X2 = \n    SWAP DUP X3 =\n      SWAP DUP X4 =\n        ...\n        SWAP DROP\n      OR\n    OR\n  OR\n</code></pre>\nThis builds up a growing mound of flags on the stack and then collapses them down at the end. As the mound is built, the value is constantly flipped up to the top of the stack and then covered with a flag. A better way to do this would be to collapse the flags as you go:<p><pre><code>  DUP  X1 =\n  OVER X2 = OR\n  OVER X3 = OR\n  ...\n  SWAP XN = OR</code></pre>",1324739711

My point was about human behavior, not the innards of program structure.<p>To rephrase: <i>would imposing arbitrary code length restrictions along with DSL-type training automatically drive programmers to write better quality code?</i><p>I believe the answer is yes. You are correct in that the technical issue is more complicated than that, but my point was asking if making an arbitrary rule would drive teams into making those kinds of design choices, instead of just being happy with the way things were and continuing to expand the code base ad infinitum. I was trying to draw in several lines of thought I gleaned from the essay and synthesize something new.<p>I also think there's a big difference in creating an arbitrary limit on function size and doing the same for an overall project. I wouldn't like the idea of limiting function size at all. You can do a lot in 10K lines of code. There's a lot more freedom there. Once again, my thrust is human behavior. Telling somebody that each little piece of code they write is subject to somewhat arbitrary restrictions is a lot more onerous to me than simply making a ""budget"" for the entire project.",1324739179

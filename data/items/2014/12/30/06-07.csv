Still, I think there is some merit to it (although I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying we&#x27;re ready for the &quot;one language to rule them all&quot; yet).<p>The paradox of choice and duplication of effort are very real problems. Let&#x27;s take web app development for example. We have PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, C#, etc. Each language has  their own set of libraries/frameworks and it takes a lot of time and effort for a programmer to learn all of them. I&#x27;ve been developing web apps for 10 years and yet, I couldn&#x27;t contribute to a web app written in Java. What if instead of having X libraries in Y languages, we had X*Y libraries for a single language or X libraries of Y higher quality for a single language?<p>Standardisation has lots of benefits.<p>The web standardised on HTTP/HTML/CSS/Javascript and it enabled the creation of a massive ecosystem of tools, libraries and pool of developers. Front-end developers can easily switch jobs and contribute to other projects. I personally dislike languages that compile to HTML/CSS/Javascript because I think standardisation trumps their benefits. C is a de facto standard in the embedded world.<p>In my opinion, sometimes the hammers are so similar (e.g. Python/Ruby) that we should just collectively agree to only use one.",1419922482

There has to be a compromise somewhere and it&#x27;s no surprise that projects in an old language like C, running on evolved systems like Unix, de facto standardized on Autoconf to make it a little easier for developers.

They will argue they need a way to discourage that behavior and one way to do that is to charge a hefty &quot;early exit&quot; fee should a passenger depart the route mid-route.

For example, imagine if an airline delivers service from A->C and is low cost. A large competitor airline has no direct route, but flies A->B and B->C, and so offers A->B->C for the same price as the first airline. The route is actually below cost (or has a substantially smaller margin), but the airline offers it anyway to harm its competitor and to keep passengers within its brand.

8813593,comment,8813343,8813543,0,0,apendleton,,,"I think this relies on the arguably-faulty assumption that ticket prices are based on airlines&#x27; costs in delivering the service. Airlines&#x27; costs probably set the floor for ticket prices most (but not all) of the time, but don&#x27;t have much to do with the typical prices. This obvious when you look at the cost of holiday travel: planes don&#x27;t become twice as expensive to fly because it&#x27;s Christmas.<p>What actual determines ticket price is mainly the supply and demand around trips between a pair of destinations (like with any other market). Lots of people want to move between DC and New York, and lots of them are business people who can afford to pay a lot, so the market can support a high price for this city pair. This isn&#x27;t true of, say, DC and Yonkers. What&#x27;s key, also, is that the layover cities (setting aside people doing the &quot;hidden city&quot; thing) are largely an implementation detail; if you&#x27;re going from DC to Yonkers, you&#x27;re comparing the flights that go through New York to flights that go through Philly directly on price (assuming about equal convenience), and you&#x27;re going to pick the cheapest one. This means market forces are going to drive these prices to be similar, even if the DC->Philly market is radically different from the DC->NYC market. The consequence is weird, unintuitive situations where a flight to the intermediate city can be more expensive than one to the final destination, if market forces are such that the market can typically support a higher price for flights to that intermediate city than they can to the ultimate destination city. Hidden city travelers take advantage of the cost disparity between the markets -- it&#x27;s a sort of arbitrage.",1419921096

Of course the carriers could instead use some extra BW and transmit the actual background noise of whoever you are talking to.<p>&quot;Comfort noise&quot; is actaully useful to signal if the call (or the audio channel) is active. Otherwise people ask each other &quot;You still there? Can you hear me?&quot; hearing the noise indicates the channel is still open.<p>As for carriers transmitting the actual background noise, it would increase bandwidth requirements. But I am not sure if I would even like to hear the background of the person talking. It could be distracting (even if it wouldn&#x27;t make a difference for bandwidth consumption).",1419920558

For example, a Swift string IS an NSString (at the moment at least).<p>It&#x27;s impossible to know for sure, but when you look back 15 years ago when Cocoa was the new and shiny to the old-trusty Carbon. Apple was actually writing software in Cocoa internally. Everything they were building towards extended from the NeXT Objective-C world. Though true, they didn&#x27;t publicly commit to Cocoa 100% until OS X 10.4, but you better believe internally they were always in. It&#x27;s just the world didn&#x27;t see it until the &quot;We&#x27;re rewriting the Finder in Cocoa&quot; campaign was announced.<p>At Apple right now, no one outside of the compiler team is working on anything interesting in Swift. It&#x27;s still locked away from them. To be fair, it&#x27;s an evolving language and will cause a lot of heartache for everyone until the language has been baked in more.<p>I know Mattt is excited for Swift.

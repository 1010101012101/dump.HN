50671,comment,50509,50509,0,0,portLAN,,,"Just add it to your monthly expenses -- apply to eHealthInsurance.com and get either short-term insurance (cheaper, doesn't cover normal visits) or one of the PPOs.<p>The only trick is you don't know exactly where you'll be living at first, so if you could use YC's address to get the process started then you could apply and get accepted <i>before</i> you move so you don't have a gap in coverage.<p>",1189022111
50670,comment,50509,50509,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"While I don't think this is a particularly good idea--as pg pointed out, you have to be an employer of people to insure them in any reasonable scalable way, because that's just the way the world of insurance works right now--I do think that this (not just insurance, but all of the boring crap like that) is perhaps the biggest single pain point of building a business.  In the first months or year or whatever it takes, you don't have enough to pay for the problem to go away, but you can't ignore payroll, insurance, income taxes, franchise taxes for the corporation, basic bookkeeping and accounting.<p>I'm not even sure what kind of person to hire for some of these tasks.  Obviously an accountant is expensive overkill for payroll and bookkeeping, and the accountants I have known outsource it.  Administaff doesn't seem to like very small companies (or at least they charge as though they don't like them).  The online services I've used for payroll have ended up with me doing most of the hard work by hand (they're glorified calculators with all the percentages already punched in, but they don't handle actually paying people or getting the taxes paid).<p>And, of course, no one should ever be without health insurance for any period of time.  It's just too much risk.  But I haven't found health insurance to be the hardest part to deal with: just call up Unicare.  They provide individuals with reasonable health care plans for reasonable price.  I pay $84/month for a crappy plan (but I'm in good health, with no bad or dangerous habits, so I just want to know that if I go to the hospital it won't bankrupt me).<p>Also, as for aston's point, you might be surprised.  Group health insurance is much more expensive than individual plans for young healthy people (most of what YC funds).  I looked into it and group insurance for me would cost about $280/month, vs. the $84 I'm paying now.  The insurance a company buys for you has to deal with pre-existing conditions, dependents, all ages, etc. and generally doesn't even discriminate based on smoker/non-smoker status.  Of course, the group rates I was looking at were for a 2-10 person company, while YC would be covering 50 or so people, so the rates might be considerably lower at that scale.<p>Anyway, it's not a bad idea for YC to do something about all of these stupid but necessary aspects of business.  The days I'm doing bookkeeping or payroll or taxes are days that are really painful...I can't think of anything in my day to day life that I hate more.  I'm now in a position to pay someone for them to go away, but I'd have to find that someone or someones...<p>But that's just me complaining.  ;-)",1189021932

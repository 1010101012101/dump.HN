It wasn't the games that killed the fun for me, it was all the abusive junk almost everyone started including with them, and that only seems to be getting worse with time.",1354463981

4861515,comment,4861058,4861318,4,0,mbell,,,"It depends on the SoC used.  Some will have 1 or 2 SATA controllers on board.  This board is based on the Exynos 4412 which I don't think has SATA controllers on board (can't find a full datasheet).  This means adding them externally, not big deal right?  But, 99% of SATA controllers today are built to talk PCI-Express, and the Exynos SoC doesn't speak PCI-Express!  We're screwed...<p>Basically the same thing happens with gigabit Ethernet (and USB 3.0).  Unless the SoC has the controller on-board or has PCI-Express (few do) there really isn't a way to plug the external controller into the SoC.  10/100 Ethernet is slow enough that you can pump its data in and out of the SoC using a SPI port and get most of the speed and many SoCs now have a 10/100 controller and USB 2.0 controllers on board.  There is no spec limit to the speed of SPI but its a single ended 2 wire protocol limiting its realistic usage to the several tens of Mbit/sec.<p>The problem is that there is no commonly accepted, generic, very high speed I/O protocol for embedded devices so if they choose not to implement PCI-Express your left without a way to pump information into and out of the SoC at fast enough speeds to support these new interfaces.",1354463890

Yeah, you can solve SICP excercises, but thats essentially it. All useful features are implementation specific, and the Scheme ecosystem is more fragmented than the Balkan. Scheme code is essentially non-portable amongst the 1001 existing implementation. You dont write ""Scheme"" directly. You write code either for ""Guile"" or for ""Chicken"" or ""Bigloo"". PLT doesnt even call their implementation Scheme any more, they call it Racket. You dont write Scheme, you write Racket.<p>This leads to the question of why a standard was nescessary at all, if youre not standardizing a critical amount of features to enable portable code.",1354463225

4861431,comment,4861022,4861285,21,0,jrajav,,,"I would probably be thinking the same thing right now if all I knew about was mindless, addictive games like World of Warcraft, League of Legends, or Call of Duty. I fully agree that pouring hundreds of hours into games like that will ""eat your life"" and give very little back for the small fix of short-term enjoyment. I've seen it happen to friends.<p>However, there are several ways to enjoy video games these days that involve a community and are much healthier. And I am <i>not</i> talking about a massively multiplayer game where the ""community"" is really just another gameplay element pulling you in. I'm talking about an external community that draws you to actively participate, to enjoy the game for something more than what it is at face value. This comes in many different forms, and I think most people would be hard pressed to say that they are ""eating the life"" of anyone. Maybe I can just list a few of them and let you decide:<p>1. Speedrunning community. I list this first because it's my favorite. Speedrunners revitalize games old and new by practicing and playing them to almost complete technical perfection. The communities are large, positive, supportive, and full of energy. Both speedrunners and viewers get to enjoy games they already loved in a completely new way, and engage in a meta-competition that is much more tangible and community-oriented than numbers on a screen beside user IDs. There are large communities in both Japan and the US/Europe (though the two don't interact much). The Japanese community generally interacts in the form of videos posted on Nico Nico [1]. The Western community has a forum and video site at Speed Demos Archive [2]. To give an example of the size and positivity of SDA, in particular, they run several marathons a year like this one [3] that draw thousands of viewers and raise tens of thousands of dollars for charity.<p>2. Indie game development. I don't think I need to say a lot about this; this community interacts enough with HN for its vitality to be clear enough. Even for lone developers, the creative aspect makes this a healthy pursuit.<p>3. Romhacking community. This is related to the indie game development community in spirit, but on a much more casual level. Using tools built to quickly make levels for games like Sonic and Super Mario World, members of these communities make completely new games out of old engines and assets. These new games - called ""romhacks"" because of the way they are made - are often posted on forums or at sites like SMW Central [4] or Sonic Retro [5]. It's a very unique kind of community that draws together creativity and games. This one is also related to #4:<p>4. ""Let's Play"" community, probably the youngest of these. Much like speedrunning, this community aims to revitalize games by playing them in an entertaining way and publishing the videos (which are then called ""Let's Play""s or LPs). These videos were usually posted on forums like Something Awful, but increasingly these communities are centered on Youtube. Very often the games played are indie games or even romhacks.<p>Edit: There is also a community related to #1, the Tool-Assisted Speedrun community [6] that aims to play games to <i>literal</i> technical perfection with the benefit of tools like savestates, frame-advance, and recording provided by emulators like zsnes. Such tools are obviously frowned upon in the normal speedrunning community.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.nicovideo.jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nicovideo.jp/</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://speeddemosarchive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://speeddemosarchive.com/</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://marathon.speeddemosarchive.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marathon.speeddemosarchive.com/</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.smwcentral.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smwcentral.net/</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_hacks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_hacks</a><p>[6]: <a href=""http://tasvideos.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tasvideos.org/</a>",1354462087

No one would ever dream today of writing a web service in C++, but back in 1995, that definitely wasn't the case.<p>As a related aside, Microsoft recently enabled us to use C++ for WinRT UI apps; keep in mind that WPF (WinRT's predecessor) only supported C# and VB (well, their was the CLR version of C++, but who used that?). So now you can write your Win8 metro app in C++ if you want, but why go through the pain and misery of doing that? Why choose C++ if C# is good enough for what you are doing?",1354461154

You have to normalize for those factors before you can even begin to think about correlating LOC to estimating bug counts. Now, take a language like Perl, Scala, or APL, where you can do a lot of things on one line of code; the bug density is obviously going to much higher than Java. Given C++'s lack of much safety (both static and dynamic), defect rates will also be higher there also.<p>Then not all defects are created equal. Can the defect be easily detected via static analysis or unit testing? Those defects will wash out during the dev process, but the time needed to find and fix them has to be considered. We also have to apply more weight to wicked defects that are not easily detected (say memory corruption in C++ that causes bad behavior away from where the defect actually originates).<p>I don't have any papers though I believe this style of thought originates from the 70s (like everything else in our field).<p>There is always the folktale about Simoni: some PM at early MSFT instituted a lines of code metrics to measure and rate programmer productivity. The first week, Simoni wrote down something like -10000 LOC for the amount of code he deleted that week. The PM was pretty silent after that. I'm sure I've got this story completely wrong, but the point is that LOC are a crude and crappy metric in any case.",1354460711

From where I come from it seems very strange that medical services / prescribed medicine has free floating &#x27;market prices&#x27; in the US. There is no such thing as a functioning market for these products - you have complete information asymmetry as well as government enforced monopoly on medication (pharmaceutical patents). Letting the providers set the price is just asking for trouble. Negotiating medical prices on government level and setting fixed prices for medical services (adjusted periodically) is absolutely necessary for a functioning general healthcare.",1442887157

Most of which involve the owner/agency contracting to <i>fewer</i> entities who do <i>more</i> of the various types of work that need to be done (design, constructing, managing, operating, financing etc.). Traditionally, in Design-Bid-Build the owner contracts with one company to design, they perform the bidding process, and a separate entity does the building, with financing also coming from their own operating/capital budget.

A team developing a malaria vaccine, for example, reports completion of clinical trials with children in Mozambique. This result is aggregated with data from other teams conducting clinical trials of other products.<p>Top-level 2011 findings include the following:<p>PATH had 199 technologies and products in our development pipeline in 2011. Fifty-one products moved forward one or more phases in the pipeline. Six products were registered, three were licensed, and two were prequalified by the World Health Organization.<p>PATH had activities in 68 developing countries. We trained more than 91,000 people in 2011 and worked on 101 policies, strategies, and guidelines. At the global level, eight guidelines and one strategy supported by PATH’s work were approved by global decision-making bodies. At the national level, 36 policies, strategies, and guidelines supported by PATH’s work were approved.
More than 74.5 million people benefitted from PATH’s work. More than $100 million in funding was mobilized to scale up PATH-championed interventions.
PATH was awarded 83 grants valued at nearly $160 million.&quot;<p>Regarding the Gates Foundation, they don&#x27;t directly research drugs, but contribute heavily to those working on polio, malaria, and HIV.",1442885757

A private taxi cannot be hailed on the street, I assume much like yellow taxis. This was once a major advantage, but uber (and equivalent apps) make it almost irrelevant.<p>Becoming a Black Cab driver is much harder than renting a medallion, though. You have to pass &quot;The Knowledge&quot; which is considered at least as hard as passing a university degree.

If safety was the only concern:<p>1) Why does the FDA approve indications?<p>2) Why has there been prosecution (possibly violating the first amendment) for promotion of off-label uses?<p>3) Why does the FDA have a &quot;breakthrough&quot; designation that fast tracks approvals solely based on their effectiveness?<p>4) Why do Pharma companies frequently run new trials using different end points in an effort to get a drug approved when the original end points they used showed no effect? Why have there been cases when the FDA didn&#x27;t approve a drug because they declared the end point used in the clinical trials was meaningless for the indication?<p>I think it is fairly clear that a shitload of time and resources at the FDA are spent deciding whether drugs are effective and if the data from the pharmaceutical company shows effectiveness.<p>Edit: I should also add the whole DESI review[1] in the 1960&#x27;s shows your statement is complete nonsense. Drugs that the FDA previously approved for safety before 1962 were re-analyzed to classify their efficacy.

The CVSup author doing his tool in Modula made a nice, case study in Modula vs X discussions. One solution I thought of was just subsetting a language like Go or Pascal w/ runtime being limited or zero. Free Pascal still has good tool support plus was first Wirth language used in systems work. GEMSOS security kernel was also written in Pascal. You might also find BootSafe interesting: a certified compiler and checker from Java to Forth for increasing assurance/maintenance of Open Firmware components. Tool is quite proprietary but the approach could be used with Go, Pascal, etc if Forth is required.<p>So, there&#x27;s some options on that. Far as Forth vs C, I think it&#x27;s fine to think C is acceptable for firmware as being a near-cross-platform assembly suddenly helps there. I&#x27;d have made C default for this given all developers, tools, and code examples available. And then we&#x27;d have this discussion to figure out how to get rid of it.<p>On other hand, doing almost everything system in C then switching to Forth for just firmware?

10256107,comment,10252162,10254162,0,0,chipsy,,,"A dataflow language overlaps with functional programming in many respects but has one key difference - components are defined to allow some form of many-in, many-out, rather than a mathematical function&#x27;s many-in, one-out. This change in syntax - which comes with design concerns around how many-out manifests(e.g. static # of outs vs. automatic copy) - has large effects on programming style. It limits how cleanly one can compose dataflow modules, and compounds the possibilities of type-mismatch, but it also affords a richer definition of module responsibilities and relationships.<p>Memoization is one of several possible optimizations. Lazy eval may appear in a fashion by blocking a module from processing an input on one channel until its other input channels also have data, but in e.g. the J. Paul Morrison definition, there&#x27;s a finite dataset and data does not get dropped on the floor, nor does it get stored in components. Eager is the default. If component implementations have broad control over when they process I/O, they can do some fairly substantial optimizations internally, though.<p>Dataflow works best as a mid-level system, controlled by and controlling other code in other styles. It can model the computing universe ground-up as a kind of electronics hardware in abstracted form(pure logic gates, no physical constraints), but this is a misuse of it. There are languages that can express control flow and arithmetic more succinctly. Moreover, the complexity of component relationship graphs in dataflow precludes using it for boilerplate of that type. It works best, instead, when the components are large enough to perform substantial functionality, but need some form of dynamic configuration.<p>Analogizing again to electronics, modular synthesis is the canonical example of dataflow in action. A modular synthesizer contains a set of building blocks - the modules - each of which turn some number of input voltages into output voltages, sometimes with physical knobs and switches on the panel. Patch cables are used to connect the modules together, allowing for a great deal of flexibility over the final signal path. In software, by comparison, a modular system operates on chunks of digital samples instead of voltage over time. The principles are the same for the end-user, while the implementation may be completely different underneath.<p>One should also note that analog synthesizers started incorporating digital CPUs as soon as it was affordable, for their most state-heavy functionality: tracking keypresses over time, and store and recall of patch data. This gives some idea of where dataflow techniques trail off and an imperative style can start to shine, hence why I call it a &quot;mid-level&quot; technique, not something that describes the whole system.",1442884159

You&#x27;re ignoring all the times that fails to justify the times it succeeds. This doesn&#x27;t change the fact that the heuristic is broken: I don&#x27;t want the content that the creators paid to be the top result, I want the top result to be what I searched for. If those happen to be the same, that doesn&#x27;t justify the crappy heuristic. And if the ad produces better results than Google, that&#x27;s a major fail on Google&#x27;s part: it still doesn&#x27;t prove that &quot;whoever paid for the space and vaguely resembles what I want&quot; is the heuristic I want used to produce the top of my Google search results.<p>> Affiliate link ads for products on pages that review the product.<p>There are so many things wrong with this. This sort of advertising manipulates reviews and makes them untrustworthy, and it means that only products which can pay for affiliate links get reviewed.<p>> Paid reviews of games, or products on Amazon: Many reviews posted on Amazon, and some professional YouTube reviewers, are paid reviews. If I&#x27;m in the review section of a web site, I am there to see a review. If I&#x27;m searching for a game review on YouTube, I want to see a review. I expect to be told that they got a product for free to do the review, but it&#x27;s also the primary content. But it&#x27;s also a paid ad.<p>Paid bias is exactly <i>not</i> what I want when I am looking for a review.<p>> Advertising is not just psychological manipulation to prefer Pepsi to Coke. It&#x27;s also communication of the existence of a product to a potential audience that wants that product.<p>What you&#x27;re not understanding here is that ads don&#x27;t add to my knowledge. Just because I don&#x27;t see ads for 10 products doesn&#x27;t mean I&#x27;m not going to find 10 products I like. It just means I&#x27;m going to find different products. And since I&#x27;ll be finding products using my own toolset rather than whatever crap advertisers smear in my face, I&#x27;ll get better results. Ads don&#x27;t make it easier to find products, they add noise to the signal and make it <i>harder</i> to find products.<p>In short: there&#x27;s no shortage of information. Ads are just crappy information.<p>>> There are no good ads.<p>> You&#x27;re using that term again, and I don&#x27;t think you know what it means.<p>You&#x27;re being intentionally dense. I&#x27;m talking about &quot;stuff that ad blockers can block&quot;. If you want to hand-wave and argue about the definition of words as if they have an inherent meaning and as if you aren&#x27;t intelligent enough to get what I&#x27;m saying from context, you&#x27;re going to be talking to yourself; I&#x27;m not going to have a pedantic argument.<p>> And how do you expect a new product to be promoted if not through advertising? You don&#x27;t just grow organic search results by magic, and waiting for word of mouth to be enough to promote a product is a pretty sure way to kill a company. Even advertising by getting a product placement on blogs tends to be practically worthless in terms of conversion numbers. Are you just saying &quot;no new products are necessary, I&#x27;m fine with what I have&quot;?<p>This is true now, but it wouldn&#x27;t be true if we could get rid of advertisers completely and <i>only</i> have word of mouth and organic search results. The reason these very good tools don&#x27;t work is because advertisers have broken them.<p><i>OF COURSE</i> I want new products. But I want ones that become popular because they&#x27;re good, not because someone paid to shove them in my face when I was looking for something else. Not only do ads not provide that, they make it harder for me to find the good stuff because they clutter up the information stream with crap.",1442884030

The initial stage is &quot;hopping.&quot; The second stage is &quot;floating,&quot; and the final stage is &quot;flying.&quot; So far, no one practicing the Yogic Flying TM-Sidhi has been observed achieving a stage beyond hopping. Achieving the floating and flying stages is dependent upon the extent to which the practitioner is able to sustain his awareness at the level of the unified field, the level of transcendental consciousness. It is by maintaining one&#x27;s awareness at this very fine level that one is able to influence the laws of nature to gain support of those laws whereby anything is possible. That is why the unified field is called the field of all possibilities; from that most fundamental and powerful level anything is possible. The author believes that eventually the final stage of levitation (flying) will be a common phenomenon.<p>This sort of flying comes out of Transcendental Mediation from the 1970s. You are right that this kind of hop is labeled &quot;flying&quot;, even though it isn&#x27;t flying.<p>However, I think sandworm101&#x27;s comment of &quot;yogis who can fly&quot; should be read more generally to include levitation.

Then it will levitate or hop about like a leaping frog. Even saints who do not practice a formal yoga[4] have been known to levitate during a state of intense devotion to God.&quot;<p>The footnote 4 mentions <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_of_%C3%81vila</a> , who was &quot;said to have been observed levitating during Mass on more than one occasion&quot;.<p>Then there&#x27;s <a href=""https://books.google.com/books?id=mSpQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT26&dq=yogi+levitate&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=yogi%20levitate&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">https://books.google.com/books?id=mSpQAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT26&dq=yo...</a> (&quot;The Autobiography of the Maha Yogi&quot;)<p>> ...

Yet, I am the only living contemporary who ever levitated four feet off the ground in front of a camera. I shall, of course, refrain from ever levitating in public, as a matter of fundamental principle for that would be a sacrilege. Furthermore, like several of my Siddhies, levitation in [sic] an Involuntary occurrence that happens in rare moments of religious ecstasy, perhaps as few as one or two times per year. There was no known yogi in history who has been able to levitate at will and on demand.<p>That&#x27;s two yogis who claim something that sounds more than kind of hopping.

They absolutely pay more for an equal amount of equal quality items.<p>Let&#x27;s say a pack of cigarettes is $7. In poor areas you can often find &quot;singles&quot; or &quot;loosys&quot; for sale at $.50-$1. They&#x27;re exactly what they sound like, single cigarettes. Usually the store owner just opens up a pack and sells each cigarette individually. Poor people with little money will buy the singles and thus 20 singles will cost $10-$20.<p>This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m making up, this actually happens in poor areas. Often times there&#x27;s not even a store owner and it&#x27;s just an individual trying to make some quick money and turn a profit (this is what Eric Garner was trying to do, sell loosies at a markup).<p>You can go on endlessly with this kind of thing. If you can imagine a packaged product, it&#x27;s probably being split up and sold as singles at a higher price with respect to the packaged price, and almost always in poor areas.<p>I&#x27;ve even seen stores that seem to make a racket out of buying stuff in bulk from Costco, breaking up the package and selling singles for 2-5x the original price. Shelf after shelf of Kirkland signature bottled water, toilet paper, detergent etc. Poor people don&#x27;t have Costco memberships even if getting the membership and just buying non-perishables in bulk would save them money in aggregate. The store had a whole repackaging operation in back where the singles would be rewrapped in new shrinkwrap, but they didn&#x27;t bother removing the label.",1442883748

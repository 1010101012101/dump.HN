5957250,comment,5956926,5957120,2,0,Skinney,,,"Clojure uses STM and has persistant datastructures by default. This makes it pretty safe when it comes to concurrency. Clojure also has good support for paralellism through pmap and reducers. Making something run in paralell is often just changing the name of a function or importing a diffrent namespace.<p>I don&#x27;t know Scala that well, but actors in scala still shares state, and doesn&#x27;t give the same level of protection when it comes to changing state. Actors also introduce some overhead in case you just want to read a single variable from a datastructure safely. You have to send a command and receive a message, wheras in clojure you just retrieve the value you want. Actors however are, to my knowledge, easier to scale across machines as actors doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be in the same process, or even on the same machine.",1372416947

5957247,comment,5956903,5956903,16,0,babuskov,,,"I read a similar article about 3 months ago and decided to give it a try. Raising price gave me less total income. Here are the details:<p>I have a product called Attic Manager (guacosoft.com/attic) which is a home inventory software with unique feature on the market - it is able to import database from all versions Quicken Home Inventory programs. Currently, it is only product on the market that does that (probably because it is not so easy to do, I spent months reverse engineering their custom file format).<p>I used to sell it for $19.99 and got about 30 orders per month consistently in the past 3 years. That&#x27;s around $600 per month gross (my actuall earnings are lower, because of payment gateway cut, but that is irrelevant here because it&#x27;s fixed percentage of gross price anyway).<p>After reading that &quot;you should charge more&quot;, I upped the price to $29.99, a 50% increase. The experiment is still going on, but in the past 3 months I got only 42 orders. That&#x27;s 14/month. 14*$30 is $420 per month, or 43% less than before.<p>So, all the &quot;you should raise you prices&quot; is just an idea to consider and maybe test, but I wouldn&#x27;t trust it blindly.",1372416862

Why ask for what you already have?<p>Of course, that&#x27;s an assumption and it may be incorrect. However on the downside if it is incorrect, you&#x27;re back in the exact same position you started in and you&#x27;ve lost nothing anyway. And as previously stated, it might get people in the habit of understanding how PGP works if mailvelope and products like it see wider adoption.<p>In a network of correspondents where everyone is running something similar to mailvelope + phoneme, it becomes an obvious thing to do to simply implement proper end to end PGP, so I also hope it might be a solution to the chicken and egg problem which has plagued PGP deployment for so long.<p>It can never hurt to fight, even if you might lose, especially when if you don&#x27;t fight, you&#x27;ll definitely lose.",1372416581
5957233,comment,5956903,5957202,8,0,jiggy2011,,,"The problem with mobile apps is that I often don&#x27;t have a clear idea of the value I will receive. I&#x27;ve bought apps in the past that I have literally never used.<p>At $1 this doesn&#x27;t really matter because I will also occasionally buy a $1 app which gives me way more than $1 in value. So really I may have paid $10 for that useful app, but the problem is that the person who wrote that useful app only gets 1/10 of the money. The other 9/10 is distributed among those who developed the useless (to me) apps.<p>The answer as you suggest is to demonstrate the value before purchase. I think the problem here is that the app store model is often not conductive to that, you often just get a couple of bad screenshots and 1 paragraph of text.<p>On the other hand I will usually do more research when buying desktop software, simply because doing research on a desktop computer is less painful (I have a big screen and a proper keyboard).",1372416563

5957225,comment,5956903,5956903,4,0,laumars,,,"I have a few problems with the article:<p>1. Two of the authors arguments for higher prices is &quot;more intelligent users&quot; and &quot;less support queries&quot;. Those strike me as incredibly snobby reasons to set a price tag. In the case of the latter, if you&#x27;re selling software then you have to be expected to support it (I know customer support is an absolute pain - I hate it as much as the next person. But think about things from the consumers perspective. You&#x27;d be pretty pissed off if you&#x27;ve paid for a product that doesn&#x27;t appear to work for you and you&#x27;re clueless about how to fix it). As for the &quot;more intelligent users&quot; remark - I think that level of selective pricing is just disgusting.<p>2. The article neglects to mention that there&#x27;s room for two different business models: free versions subsidised by ads and non-free but without adverts. While it sounds like the author does have an ad subsided free app on the market despite his arguments about the merits of premium versions, quite a few publishers seem happy to release against both business models concurrently (ie they&#x27;ll have both a free and a premium version available). I don&#x27;t have figures about how successful that strategy is (if anyone else does, I&#x27;d be interested to read them), but I think the theory of that works rather well as you&#x27;re combating the piracy / freeloader issue with the ad subsidised versions and have a premium version available for the aforementioned snobs and those who just hate adverts.<p>3. The whole article amounts to little more than price fixing and arguments against a free market. The very reason prices are so low is because the market is saturated so developers undercut each other to get sales. If the author doesn&#x27;t like that, then perhaps he should switch to a market that isn&#x27;t saturated rather than demanding that everyone is owed financial reward for their work - even if their product is unoriginal and available &quot;ten to the dozen&quot;. This might sound harsh, but it&#x27;s little different to any other industry. eg if everyone became window washers tomorrow, there would be more people washing windows than there would be houses with windows needing washing - so the whole market would collapse. And it&#x27;s a similar case in mobile app industry, the market is far to saturated to guarantee every developer a decent wage.<p>I hate being negative like this, but I&#x27;m so sick and tired about hearing people moan that they&#x27;re not earning as much as they think they should be while working in a saturated market. And the remarks about tailoring his prices to the &quot;intelligent&quot; was just unnecessary in my opinion.",1372416382

As much as I&#x27;d love to agree on principle, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll happen with the app stores&#x27; current incarnations.<p>There are several problems that prevent this from being actionable for most devs:<p>1. The barrier to entry is consistently getting lower, not higher. It&#x27;s no longer particularly difficult to deploy an app - either learn to design and build it, or pay people to do that for you. It&#x27;s never been easier to put yourself out there as a mobile developer.<p>2. This isn&#x27;t marketing enterprise software to employees with spending access to sizable company budgets. This is marketing small applications of limited practical value (i.e. almost every mobile game) to people with limited wealth without much in the way of customer support. People are shrewd about their software nowadays - yes, they are more willing to spend their money on a Starbucks coffee than an app, and you can argue the existential implications and idiocy of this all you want, <i>it&#x27;s still what they&#x27;re willing to do with their money.</i><p>3. The markets are too large. They&#x27;re saturated with crap and quality alike and it&#x27;s insanely difficult to get noticed. If you are making a game, weather, networking, camera, utility or entertainment app, you&#x27;ve got the deck stacked against you. These are released en masse every single day by teams of developers. Because of this, it&#x27;s a race to the bottom and quality becomes undervalued. This is, as always, supply and demand.<p>4. A lot of the app store is an old boys&#x27; club, and the way to get in front of a wide range of users is broken. If you have a reputable team behind you, a large company&#x27;s backing and you do a lot of marketing, this will not be an issue for you. But that&#x27;s not most developers. Most developers will struggle to swim upstream in vain just to get noticed in one of the &quot;Top ___&quot; lists. They might get a faint spotlight at #25 before being thrown back into the depths of the app store like a rejected fish on a line. It gives the term &quot;starving artist&quot; a new meaning.<p>I mean, I don&#x27;t want to be cynical. I&#x27;m all in favor of developers not underselling themselves. But I think you have to do a lot more than just tell people to adjust their prices when you have all the aforementioned forces working against them.<p>I can see that in some cases selling your mobile software for more leads to nice benefits, like less of a customer support headache, requiring fewer purchases, etc. But that&#x27;s not possible for most devs because most apps couldn&#x27;t reasonably be priced at 30 euros. A really high quality audio or business app could be, sure. But that indie game house? No, that advice doesn&#x27;t help them.",1372414735

You see, journalism is not a claim to objective truth, but a procedure aimed at achieving a minimum level of validity where it comes to events. When you read a news article, you should (to some extent) be able to trust its contents on the merits of the journalistic method. Whereas with an opinion piece, it&#x27;s not bound by this procedure. Note - nobody is arguing &#x27;absolute objectivity&#x27; here. It&#x27;s a matter of trust in a procedure.  \nOf course, it&#x27;s fine to distrust the journalistic method, to not see it as absolute truth, but to deny or entirely dismiss the distinction is annoyingly daft.<p>Also, afaik, this story is still everywhere.

While the 3D tail on the third iteration aims to remedy this, it was still too popping (due to brightness, gloss and drop shadows) and increasingly so as one moves farther away from the tail. In the new version, the subtler earth (&#x27;dull&#x27;) combats this. The fox actually feels less menacing.<p>A lighter blue makes the earth feel milky/foggy. Adding contrast to the continents just makes more details come up front and feels messy. Even with the toned down land masses, the sphericality of the new continents is actually much better felt in the new version.<p>The brightness and the details of the thinner tail makes it weight evenly with the wider and more uniform head and body.

There is not a universal definition of what defines a language and what is simply a dialect or a regional variation; this applies especially on large continents where there can be greater variation in language features between geographically remote locations, but no clean boundary at which you can say people speak one or the other language.<p>2. Languages evolve, diverge and sometimes borrow, and so a group of related languages can share the same potentially idiosyncratic feature because of common evolutionary roots rather than because the feature makes sense.

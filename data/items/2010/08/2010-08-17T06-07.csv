It makes sense when you read the two phrasings next to each other, but it does seem like a pretty subtle wording difference. I think in practice people tend to differentiate which one is meant by context more than by ""degrees Celsius"" versus ""Celsius degrees"" being used consistently.<p>Should Google should convert the query somehow? It seems like adding two temperatures in degrees Celsius is something that never really makes sense (or subtracting, multiplying, or dividing them), so faithfully executing it like they currently do is rarely what's intended.",1282028356

1610436,comment,1609571,1610396,0,0,compay,,,"Simply put, when I first heard about TDD I got very excited and made the mistakes you would expect a well-intentioned but uninformed person would make: spending WAY too much time worrying about how to structure my tests correctly, which sometimes distracted me from the ""real"" problem at hand.<p>At this point I would certainly not consider myself a great expert on testing, but I think I've acquired a bit more intuition on what and how to test things. I don't usually work in a strictly ""test first"" manner because often times it's easier for me to ""sketch"" out a few classes and go through a couple attempts at organizing things before I find an approach that works for me. In these cases, testing first is a pain in the butt.<p>Other times, for example if I'm implementing some kind of tricky data filter, writing the tests first helps me think about the possible problems I might have to deal with in my implementation.<p>In general though, my projects usually end up with close to 100% code coverage, even if some of the tests are not very granular. Throughout the lifecycle of the code I maintain, I add tests when fixing bugs to avoid regressions. The tests that I write obviously don't catch every bug, but they do usually stop me from making embarrassing, silly mistakes which I think covers a pretty significant percentage of bugs in general. I don't usually have to worry about breaking things when refactoring or adding new features, which is a great feeling that I pretty much never felt in either my ""no testing"" or ""way too much testing"" phases.<p>So basically I have a very pragmatic attitude towards testing which I think would be non-threatening to a skeptic like yourself. :-) Part of the problem is that you might be letting yourself get turned off to valuable and useful techniques, not because of the techniques themselves, but the way in which they are being presented to you.<p>But at the end of the day, you have to find whatever works best for you to make the best code you can, and don't worry about what other people think.",1282027606

1610426,comment,1610354,1610354,0,0,_delirium,,,"It looks like it must be using kelvin as its canonical units:<p><pre><code>  0C + 0C = 273.15 K + 273.15 K = 546.3 K = 273.15 C
</code></pre>
The weirdness is that conversions like that don't work for units that have different zero points. Perhaps addition of temperatures isn't really well defined? If 273.15 K + 273.15 K does <i>not</i> equal 0 C + 0 C, despite 273.15 K = 0 C, it's not clear what addition ""means"" in this context.<p>One restricted form of addition that makes sense (which maybe is what's intended?) is to consider the 1st temperature an actual temperature, and the 2nd temperature a temperature <i>difference</i> in units of degrees-C (or degrees-K, or degrees-F). So e.g.:<p><pre><code>  ""5 C warmer than 30 C""
  = 30 C + 5 C
  = 303.15 K + 5 K
  = 308.15 K
  = 35 C
</code></pre>
But then addition isn't commutative. The problem is that ""degrees C"" is overloaded here, to mean both a position on a scale, and the size of a unit on that scale, with no conventional short way of distinguishing which one you mean (which is one reason Kelvin was invented, since things aren't ambiguous if you put absolute zero at 0 K).",1282027264

When James Madison and 54 other geniuses went to Philadelphia in the sweltering summer of 1787, they did not go there to design an efficient government. That idea would have horrified them. They wanted a safe government, to which end they filled it with blocking mechanisms: three branches of government, two branches of the legislative branch, veto, veto override, supermajorities, and judicial review. And yet, I can think of nothing the American people have wanted intensely and protractedly that they did not eventually get. The world understands, a world most of whose people live under governments they wish were capable of gridlock, that we always have more to fear from government speed than government tardiness.""<p>-George Will",1282027208

The last 2 of the 3 are wrong, so I'd say this is definitley a bug.<p>EDIT: I think I figured it out. It's converting everything after the first temperature to Kelvin, without converting the first temp to Kelvin, and then just doing the arithmetic on the numbers...<p><pre><code>  0C + 0C => 0C + 273K => 0 + 273 = 273

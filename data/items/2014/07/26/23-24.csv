8091369,comment,8090996,8091022,2,0,jiggy2011,,,"I&#x27;ve heard anti legalisation advocates suggest that prohibition of alcohol would indeed be a positive thing and were alcohol a new drug then it should be criminalised. However prohibition attempts (of alcohol) are doomed to fail because of how much drinking is entwined with our culture. For example pubs or bars being focal points of the community, wine being a common meal accompaniment etc. Marijuana doesn&#x27;t have the same culture built around it , except for a minority of stoners.",1406419192

The majority of stoners will tell you that it&#x27;s very safe to drive while high. Why? When you&#x27;re high each and every one of your senses are heightened, making you more &#x27;aware&#x27; of things going on around you, making you a safer driver. And in addition, the feeling of slight paranoia usually makes you drive pretty slow and careful. I have no studies to back that up, but most stoners generally agree on this.<p>Never heard of one single incident of smoking and driving causing accidents. Alcohol and driving on the other hand, oh boy, been there done that, never doing that again (irresponsible teenager at the time). Vision blurry, misjudgement is distance, etc., very dangerous side effects for driving usually only associated with alcohol, and not marijuana.<p>Btw, I&#x27;m one of those productive stoners, can&#x27;t stay away from my programming hobbies when I&#x27;m high. I enjoy marijuana, but I&#x27;m not exactly an advocate of legalization. There are many dangers with Marijuana from my experience, but driving certainly isn&#x27;t one of them.",1406419162

8091355,comment,8090190,8091068,14,0,eqdw,,,"Hey man, I share your fear. I hate cars. I hate driving.<p>I live in the SF Bay Area. I work in downtown San Francisco. When I lived in SF proper, it would usually be faster to walk somewhere than drive, because of traffic. Then factor in finding parking. Then factor in <i>paying</i> for parking (upwards of $10/hr anywhere important). Add the stress of driving in dense areas, moronic pedestrian tourists who wander into the middle of the the streets, cyclists who seem to have a death wish, and other drivers who act like it&#x27;s an aggression competition<p>Now I live across the bay (I got gentrified out of SF), and it&#x27;s even worse. The freeway nearest me is bumper-to-bumper stop and go across 5 lanes of traffic, for 3 hours in the morning and for 3 hours in the evening. Everyone is just as aggressive, but the speeds have quintupled.<p>Bignaj mentions freedom. Shortly after buying my car, I went up to Portland for a conference. I thought, FUCK YEAH ROAD TRIP. Well, for one, turns out 11 hours of driving in one day is hard. I looked at the radio at the wrong moment and almost killed myself. I burned about $250 worth of gas round trip. And once I got to Portland, parking was $30 a night. After the trip was over, when I came home, I priced out airplane tickets. A round trip for both my girlfriend and myself, was cheaper than the cost of gas + parking in Portland. It would have saved us the better part of a day&#x27;s worth of time (at Bay Area tech salaries, $400), and it would have given me a 100% reduction in near-death experiences. Maybe it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m Canadian, and used to Air Canada prices, but airline travel is so cheap in this country that, for the vast majority of places people want to go, flying there is cheaper and easier than driving. I don&#x27;t see how car = freedom in that regard.<p>I own a car. I wish I didn&#x27;t, but I already have it. It&#x27;s paid in full, I have a flawless driving record so insurance isn&#x27;t that bad. I like going on day trips hiking. I&#x27;ve run the numbers, renting a car every day I want to hike would be cheaper than buying the car, but the car is already bought and depreciated at this point so too late on that. I would&#x27;ve traded my car for a smart car or scooter years ago if it wasn&#x27;t for that. And I&#x27;d be doing without that if I could afford to live in a walkable place here.<p>Cars are horrible, and most utilitarian arguments for them are terrible.<p>And P.S.: That horrifies me too. Every 3 months, one 9/11 worth of americans die in motor vehicle accidents. We haven&#x27;t declared a war on driving yet",1406419037

But I&#x27;m not sure that this is such a secret technique exclusive to shell programmers - object-oriented languages can and does seem to like to use &quot;fluent interfaces&quot;, I think its called, which has the same pipelining style. Functional programmers are able to and probably find it convenient to use a &quot;pipeline style&quot; on longer expressions that are essentially long chains of function application or function composition - they just have to flip the order of the operators for function application and function composition, respectively. This is possible in languages like Haskell, and I think it is even pretty idiomatic in F#.",1406417395

Yes, mines may kill a lot of people, but you know that walking in. You mention that any adequate miner will have a Geiger counter. You need electricity for that, and an idea of not only atomic or chemical theory, but sub-atomic theory. I&#x27;ll remind that the Great Wall of China was built with much much less and is much less than 10k years old.<p>Also, you think that once people figured out that the metal cans buried deep (in what may or may not be a desert in 10k years) cause death quickly, that they would run away. History has proven this many times not to be the case. Disease is a similar threat to people like radiation. It moves unseen, until recently, it&#x27;s dynamics were a mystery. The cause is death or sever scarring and discomfort in extreme cases, it is debilitating and painful and very confusing. Often times, the cures were random attempts that may have made things worse.<p>What did we do with this threat? Well, the Indians may have a word with you about infected blankets. Or besieged castles that had rotting bodies thrown into them via catapult. Disease has been used as a weapon for nearly forever.<p>What make anyone think that in 7k years another Genghis or Alexander wont use the magic death barrels to invade Nuevo Houston? The issue is that with disease, your crops were still fine, you water was not glowing, your cows would still eat. With radiation, you don&#x27;t get those things. The disease parallel break down into a plague of Moses type scenario, only it won&#x27;t go away.<p>And that&#x27;s if we just devolve into medieval savages again. Imagine what a person with some atomic theory could do with this stuff. The horror is unimaginable. At the end of the day, this stuff has to be very well taken care of/totally forgotten. There are no go betweens really. And since life and history rarely if ever forget about a potential weapon, I got bad news.",1406417385

It could confuse a stupid person into thinking a dumb celebrity twitting a racial slur is one of the primary causes of inequality.<p>The &quot;caste system&quot; is entrenched poverty. Visual markers (skin colour) might make it harder to fight the poverty cycle (as it speeds up white flight, and causes some profiling and other discrimination), but the fundamental problem is no longer about race.<p>The poverty cycle in the US was <i>caused</i> by racism, and is to some extent worsened by racism. But if you want to stop it, you have to fight poverty. Free community college level education to young mothers (and young fathers), remedial literacy (for the kids who need it) in K-6. A few busses, to prevent the segregation due to white flight.

(However, I&#x27;ve become convinced, later in my career, in the value of having some representation, like a Hollywood writer&#x27;s union.) If you&#x27;re a professional, &quot;I was following orders&quot; is no excuse.<p>The flip side of that, which professionals tend to enjoy, is that your boss&#x27;s power over you must be limited. Thus, the profession gives credibility to all members. If you get fired because your boss doesn&#x27;t like you, you&#x27;re still a doctor. The AMA wants it to be this way, because if the boss held as much power as in most jobs, professionals wouldn&#x27;t have the autonomy under which that responsibility (don&#x27;t harm patients, even if ordered to do so) makes sense.<p>The professional organization also, at least in theory, looks out for its membership. If doctors are autonomous (i.e. can always find jobs) and wealthy enough that they have the resources to keep up with lifelong duties (e.g. keeping abreast of medical advances) then the risk that they are compromised against their obligations is low.<p>A doctor can say, &quot;I won&#x27;t do this, because I believe it will harm the patient.&quot; A software engineer can&#x27;t.

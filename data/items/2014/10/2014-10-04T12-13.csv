Referential transparency definitely has its victims, and debugging is one of them. Debug.Trace is quite useful, and also violates referential transparency. That Haskell provides it is an admission that strict R.T. is unworkable.<p>I&#x27;d disagree that this is any real attack on the merits of referential transparency, since Debug.Trace is not part of application code. It violates referential transparency in the same way an external debugger would. It&#x27;s an out of band debugging tool that doesn&#x27;t make it into production.<p>> Baloney! Haskell&#x27;s laziness makes the order of execution highly counter-intuitive. Consider<p>I wouldn&#x27;t say it makes order of execution highly counter-intuitive, and your above example is pretty intuitive to me. But expanding your point, time and space complexity can be very difficult to reason about - so I&#x27;ll concede that&#x27;s really a broader version of your point.<p>> Haskell returns a new pointer to a buffer, while other versions need to copy into a new buffer? This is nonsense.<p>C uses null-terminated strings, so it order to extract a substring it must be copied. It also has mutable strings, so standard library functions would need to copy even if the string were properly bounded.<p>Java using bounded strings, but still doesn&#x27;t share characters. If you extract a substring, you&#x27;re getting another copy in memory.<p>Haskell, using the default ByteString implementation, can do a &#x27;substring&#x27; in O(1) time. This alone was probably a large part of the reason Haskell came out ahead - it wasn&#x27;t computing faster, it was doing less.<p>Obviously in Java and C you could write logic around byte arrays directly, but this point was for a naive implementation, not a tuned version.<p>> This would seem to imply that Haskell will &quot;read ahead&quot; from a file. Haskell does not do that<p>It would seem counter-intuitive that the standard library would read one byte at a time. I would put money on the standard file operations buffering more data than needed - and if they didn&#x27;t, the OS absolutely would.<p>> Like laziness, immutability is almost always a performance loss.<p>On immutability -<p>In a write-heavy algorithm, absolutely. Even Haskell provides mutable data structures for this very reason.<p>But in a read-heavy algorithm (Such as my example above) immutability allows us to make assumptions about the data - such as the fact that i&#x27;ll never change. This means that the standard platform library can, for example, implement substring in O(1) time complexity instead of having to make a defensive copy of the relevant data (Lest something else modify it).<p>On Laziness -<p>I&#x27;m still relatively fresh to getting my head around laziness, so take this with a grain of salt. But my understanding, from what I&#x27;ve been told and from some personal experience:<p>In completely CPU bound code, laziness is likely going to be a slowdown. But laziness can be also make it easier to write code in ways that would be difficult in strict languages, which can lead to faster algorithms with the same effort. In this particular example, it was much easier to write this code using streaming non-blocking IO that it would be in C<p>> It is not especially difficult to write a referentially transparent function in C. Haskell gives you more confidence that you have done it right, but that measures correctness, not performance.<p>Except that GHC can do some clever optimizations with referential transparency that a C compiler (probably) wouldn&#x27;t - such as running naively written code over multiple cores.<p>> When it comes to parallelization, it&#x27;s all about tuning. Haskell gets you part of the way there, but you need more control to achieve the maximum performance that your hardware is capable of. In that sense, Haskell is something like Matlab: a powerful prototyping tool, but you&#x27;ll run into its limits.<p>I completely agree. If you need bare to the metal performance, then carefully crafted C is likely to still be the king of the hill for a very long time. Haskell won&#x27;t even come close.<p>But in day to day code, we tend to not micro-optimize everything. We tend to just write the most straight forward code and leave it at that. Haskell, from my experience so far, for the kinds of workloads I&#x27;m giving it (IO Bound crud apps, mostly) tends to provide surprisingly performant code under these conditions. I&#x27;m under no illusion that it would even come <i>close</i> to C if it came down to finely tuning something however.",1412426392

Aside from the immediate and overwhelming response likely, the human traces would be enormous and unavailable. A drone, in contrast, comes from some unknown place off in some unknown direction, can with ease get anywhere near the target (on a nearby roof for instance), and then when the task is complete it can go low and fast and get back to a drop-off. For arson and peeping, the same premise holds -- a drone can go to exactly where is needed, do what is necessary, and get away with, currently, essentially zero risk of capture.<p>Will we eventually have drone registrations and tracking systems, comprehensive urban radio tracking and announcement, police overrides, etc? Yeah, probably, which was what I was getting at -- events will inevitably happen, and regulations will adjust.",1412425153

8409332,comment,8402079,8407787,2,0,klibertp,,,"> but (quickly, in my opinion) hits a point of diminishing returns.<p>That&#x27;s certainly true - it depends on the tools you use and problems you use them to solve, but sooner or later you&#x27;ll see your &quot;sharpening&quot; stop giving you any advantage. That&#x27;s the moment you should just stop :) And maybe try other tools: but that&#x27;s always a non-trivial time investment and should be done only after making sure there actually is something to be gained from the switch.<p>This is true in most other areas as well. For example, I&#x27;m collecting knives as a hobby. I had to learn how to care for them and sharpen them. It&#x27;s incredible how sharp you can make a knife given proper tools - whetstones ans stropping - you can get an edge which is sharper than any scalpel or razor. It&#x27;s also a complete waste of time to do so: it takes hours to make a knife that sharp and it takes one or two cuts to dull it. Granted, my &quot;dulled&quot; edge is probably still sharper than anything you ever saw ;) but in the end I get the same edge I&#x27;d get without those extra hours spent on polishing it. It then stays that way for quite a long time. It took me years to learn how much sharpening is &quot;good enough&quot;. Now, for my primary pocket folding knife, I spend 15-30 minutes sharpening it per week and get an edge I can trust.<p>It&#x27;s the same in programming. Both sharpening knives and tinkering with programming tools can be pleasant by itself. It takes practice to recognize that &quot;good enough&quot; is actually really ok and that anything more than that is a waste of time. Still, I can&#x27;t imagine <i>not</i> sharpening my knives at all. Or giving them to someone else for sharpening. The very idea seems crazy to me.",1412425072

For fully remote work as a programmer, honestly, it tends to top out at $45/hour for experienced people. If you aren&#x27;t experienced yet, you can&#x27;t charge as much. This is because there&#x27;s basically infinite workers willing to work in Europe on programming at that price.<p>For someone who can meet in person in the US, on site, with a legal ability to work and then works remotely you can do double that. For someone on site rates easily reach $200/hour and above. My Dad used to bill $213/hour doing neural network programming for credit card companies.

I quote:<p>&quot;\nEventually people will begin to put their memories of their lives on their sites. At first they will be like a grand photo-album, but then things will get more complicated. People will begin to journal their memories (cleaned up and detuned or exaggerated). This will be called their Book Of Life and when you fall in love or become very close with someone you will share your “Book of Life”. You will go to their past (as they remember it or as they want it to be remembered) which is not to say that that is how it really was, but then, that is another story. In the end, who cares? The motto of the day will be,”Intention is Everything”.<p>Some people will constantly hang out in their own Memory Palaces. Some will call this Cyber-Porn. Masturbatory! With some people, taking a walk through their Book of Life will be like a walk through a very cultured and cluttered museum. With others it will be a walk in a park. With still others, you might not want to walk through their Book alone, without a guide and without protection. And especially not at night, even Cyber-Night. It might resemble a cross between Times Square, New Year’s Eve 1999, and a car crash in progress with everything happening at once and yet with all the separate incidents frozen in time, to be savored later, like the left-overs from a frozen dinner. From a Jeffery Dhamer buffet.<p>Some people will actually hire others to design their sites, so it will be dramatic or pretty or impressively chic. Beware of anyone who has someone else design their Book of Life.&quot;<p>link to article:<a href=""http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/column.php?id=143352"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/column.php?id=143352</a>",1412424553

Will they all be the same quality? Of course not. But the point is it&#x27;s very hard to differentiate yourself for a prospective client.<p>Now, taking on the whole project is much harder and requires more experience but it pays off because there&#x27;s less competition. More specifically, if you can gather the requirements and really understand the problem, finding the best technology for it, coding it and managing other freelancers as well as delivering a high quality project with amazing documentation.. that&#x27;s gold.<p>It&#x27;s so much better to charge for a whole project than bill per hour.",1412424210

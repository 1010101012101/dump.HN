NDA's can range from impossibly restrictive to nearly inert with a few small wording changes. If someone insists on a weirdly restrictive NDA, they're probably a dick to work with anyway.<p>Nobody goes back to look up the wording in the NDA.

3777995,story,,,1,1,xssoftware,"Time and Attendance System Software",,"Today, most employers face a challenge in controlling employee’s attendance. Some of the major problems are; “buddy‐punching”, unauthorized\novertime, time spent on processing employees’\nattendance, and human error in payroll calculation.PayPunch Time and Attendance system was developed in 2004 and since then Xpress\nSoftware, has been providing Biometric Time\nand Attendance solutions to thousands of customers\nin organizations such as; government,\nmedical, food processing, manufacturing, and\nretail. PayPunch system is being implemented\nin businesses of all sizes, numbering\nfrom just a few to thousands of employees operating in different environments; such as factories, restaurants, hotels, warehouses, offices and construction sites. PayPunch is a Time & Attendance tracking system that works in conjunction with biometric time clock: Fingerprint Readers and Hand Readers, as\nwell as, non‐biometric devices: Proximity and HID Card Readers. Instead of employees punching in a time‐card or logging their attendance by hand, they simply place their finger on the Fingerprint Reader sensor, place their hand into the Hand Reader or flash a card in front of the proximity or HID card reader and PayPunch does the rest!\nPayPunch is a simple solution that pays for itself over and over again by allowing your organization to:<p>• Automate payroll processing\n• Eliminate buddy‐punching\n• Eliminate time‐cards\n• Eliminate early punch‐ins\n• Eliminate unauthorized overtime\n• Eliminate hours of payroll calculations<p>Accurately reports employee time/attendance to Payroll & HR PayPunch on average will pay for itself within 1‐3 months. It completely eliminates the time and effort required by the\nShift Supervisor to monitor the time‐clock activity at punch in/out times and significantly reduces the manual involvement of payroll and human resources departments, consequently leading to substantial cost savings and improved productivity.<p>PayPunch Features\n• Daily and weekly statistics and reports\n• Manual adjustments (by Authorized Personnel only)\n• Shifts schedule support\n• Attendance exceptions tracking\n• Multi‐factories support and multi‐devices support\n• Vacation and paid holidays tracking\n• Multi‐level password protection\n• Flexible configuration of the rounding rules and grace periods\n• Attendance data export to Payroll software\nPayPunch Overview\nPayPunch Time and Attendance\nSystem is comprised\nof 3 main parts:\n1. Punch Clock device such as Fingerprint Reader, Hand Reader or Proximity Card Rader.\n2. Universal Biometric Driver (UBD) software\nwhich provides communication between device and\ncomputer with the database.\n3. PayPunch software which provides the necessary\nuser interface to review and modify punches, print various reports and export data to a payroll\nsystem.<p>Each employee punches in when they start work and punches out when they finish work at a\ntime clock device located at an entry point. (This can be done many times throughout a day to\naccount for breaks and lunches.) Universal Biometric Driver (UBD) software periodically connects to the device(s) and downloads logs into the PayPunch. Authorized user, can then login\ninto the PayPunch program to view all employees punctual attendance, and make appropriate\nadjustments. Different reports can be printed out such as Time Card, Latecomers, Absent, and\nothers. In addition, PayPunch offers a report builder tool to allow users to create their own custom reports. Payroll data can be exported to excel, CSV or other preferred formats later to be imported into the company Payroll System.\nPayPunch can work with unlimited number of devices. In addition, different types of devices\ncan work together. For example, Fingerprint Reader can be installed in the office and Hand\nReader can be installed in the warehouse. Data from both devices can be extracted into the same\nsystem. Time clock devices can be connected to PayPunch remotely. All Fingerprint Readers and Proximity\nCard Readers have a built‐in ethernet module and for the Hand Reader ethernet module can\nbe added as an option. As long as the remote location has internet, PayPunch can connect to the\ndevices and retrieve the attendance logs. In addition, Hand Reader can have optional dial‐up modem module and PayPunch will connect to the device using dial up modem.",1333139990

After years of growth and dividends and success, they have gone through a decade of sideways motions where they are resorting various and sundry cost cutting moves to keep their stock afloat. They have 'good enough' disease.<p>That is the disease where computers and their products which run on those computers have become 'good enough' and their customer base isn't rolling over every 12months to pony up an upgrade fee. One of the interesting ways to see this effect is to look for sales of technical books about older versions of a particular software. When they are still selling well it is because those folks are using the 'old' version rather than upgrade.<p>Given the pricing model Adobe doesn't have a good way to capture that market. They have aggressively been trying to shut down re-sale of older versions on Ebay and elsewhere but the courts have handed them a couple of set backs too because their licenses do actually allow it.<p>So they have a product, Flash, which they have already said is 'dead' [2] in that its future is maintenance only, and so they perhaps figure, what the heck, lets get some money out of it before it goes.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&chdv=1&chvs=maximized&chdeh=0&chfdeh=0&chdet=1332878400000&chddm=1154686&chls=IntervalBasedLine&q=NASDAQ:ADBE&ntsp=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=1&chdd=1&chds=1&...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/10/technology/adobe_flash/index.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://money.cnn.com/2011/11/10/technology/adobe_flash/index...</a>",1333139640

3777870,comment,3777150,3777150,1,0,simba-hiiipower,,,"Interesting that you look to its dominance in Mobile (Android) affecting on Email/Calendaring when considering such a case. That never really crossed my mind; but I have done some thinking on the topic and feel there is a much more poignant case for an abuse of monopoly power by GOOG. And, in my opinion, I feel that what GOOG has done is far worse than MSFT in its case. With that said, though, I also believe the risk of GOOG facing a similar case is highly unlikely and I’ll explain why.<p>First off, I’d argue that GOOG’s dominance in Mobile is not the cause of any potential antitrust action (at this point), but rather, the result of an abuse of its monopoly power in Search. And (again, my opinion here) this is far worse than MSFT’s abuse in leveraging Windows’ dominance as an OS to enter the Browser market.<p>I’ll start with looking at MSFT. At the time of the case Windows as an OS commanded essentially the entire market for 'connected devices' (back then the only real connected device was the PC). And the only practical way to use a browser was through a PC. So MSFT used its dominance in the first, a market which it controlled entirely, to break into the latter, an emerging market with many small players. While this may seem ‘bad’ (it is, as it stifles innovation in the space) it clearly made sense for the company as a defensive measure. MSFT saw where the market was heading (…the internet), and realized that the growth of browsers (the gateways to the internet) that were not tied-down to a particular OS could threaten Windows’ dominance. So MSFT created IE and bundled it with Windows, for free, while strong-arming Hardware manufacturers to not bundle Netscape (and others). Again, yes this is bad. But it makes perfect business sense as a defensive move to preserve an existing product (and especially so when you’re dealing with a product that was essentially the whole company at the time).<p>Now let’s look at GOOG. In the wake of a competitor essentially building-out a new market (yes, smartphones were around for years before the iPhone; but look at the market pre and post release and you’ll see why I call it a new market) GOOG acquired and built-out Android to compete. <For this case let’s just put aside the fact that mush of Android utilizes patented IP from, oddly enough, MSFT’s Windows Mobile (among many others) and looks, umm.. ‘similar’ to the iPhone’s UI. After all, in the above I ignored the fact that IE was likely heavily influenced by Netscape and others in the market, so it’s only fair we put that aside.> So far, nothing really different here. And, like MSFT with IE, GOOG made Android free. But here is why I find GOOG’s abuse far worse.. MSFT did what it did to protect its product; GOOG, on the other hand, used monopoly profits from dominance in one industry to entirely undermine an, let’s be honest, entirely unrelated industry. We’re not talking Mobile search here, we’re talking an entire Mobile OS; and one that competes feature-to-feature with others in the market. And taking an entire OS, which is arguably one of the most valuable contributor to the market (in terms of IP), and making it free, is one of the worst things a company could do. It is for this reason, that as extreme of a view as it was, I can entirely relate to Steve Job’s views on the issue (especially if you couple-in the element I left out above).<p>So, with all that said, why don’t I think GOOG faces the same threat of antitrust action as MSFT? Well, I’ll keep it short and say that times change, markets change, and the relative positions of the players involved matters. At the time of MSFT’s case people feared the idea that any one company could become so dominant. This, coupled with the fact that the goliath that is/was MSFT was taking on relatively small players like Netscape, and you have the perfect combination for major antitrust litigation. GOOG faces different attitudes in today’s society and the fact that it’s undercutting the likes of AAPL (they made how much last quarter!?), RIMM, MSFT and others likely won’t mount the same type of pressure if it were truly entering a new market with smaller players. Though I feel they deserve it, I don’t see GOOG facing the same situation MSFT did, and that’s just the way it is.<p>And, getting back to the original post, I feel if this larger issue, and more severe abuse, is unlikely to present a threat to GOOG, I doubt integrating its services within Android will either.",1333138023

3777847,comment,3777525,3777525,2,0,robomartin,,,"I disagree with the comments indicating that the title is too emotional.  I think it needs to be whatever it has to be in order to bring eyeballs to this issue.  None-techies have no idea of what is possible when they sign-on to and use various social networks and tools.  Because of this they, almost invariably, end-up horribly exposed in very public ways.  Articles such as this one need to appeal to emotion and, hopefully, go viral, in order to have non-tech folks understand, protect themselves and their kids.<p>It's like folks that apply decals with the names of their kids on the back of their SUV's.  I've never understood why someone would do something that stupid.  In some cases they even go as far as also providing clues as to what they are into.  The most common example of this is having the Christian ichthus (fish) symbol under their names.<p>I struck-up a conversation with one such parents at the local school our kids attend during an open house event.  I explained just how much I knew about their kids by making a number of inferences from the very public access they were providing through these seemingly innocent little stickers on the back of the SUV.  It wasn't hard at all to demonstrate just how bad an idea this was.  They thanked me and went out to the parking lot to remove the stickers right  away.<p>I don't like to think ill of people and I generally don't (and have scars to prove it).  This does not mean that one has to provide all the necessary tools and information to facilitate becoming a victim.",1333137704

At the moment if you have something that you want to encourage your followers to spread, the most you can do is say ""Please Retweet!"" (which a lot of people do - <a href=""http://search.twitter.com/search?q=please+retweet"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search.twitter.com/search?q=please+retweet</a> ). We are just trying to make an action that people already do, easier.",1236481195

506958,comment,506920,506920,0,0,jasonkester,,,"So it's a text box that creates links that, when clicked, send you over to twitter where you can click submit to turn them into spam?<p>That suggests two groups of users:  Spammers to post links, and, uh... stooges to click links.  I can see the motivation for the spammers.  What exactly is the motivation for people to come to this site and click links?<p>It just doesn't make any sense at all.",1236481002

506955,comment,506800,506800,0,0,bluefish,,,"The thing that's interesting to me is both Blogger and Twitter focus on simple, straight-forward human to human communication. Neither are complex or try to solve abstract, confusing problems.<p>By the measure of Blogger and Twitter's popularity, Evan is obviously skillful, regardless of whether or not Twitter is purchased by Google or some other entity.  He focuses on an area relevant to all humans, communication.  He makes his services easy for everyone to use.  He has the foresight to see potential value in something unexplored, and he has the tenacity to work problems long enough for the results to prove if his hunches are right.<p>But perhaps most important he tries over and over, failing more often than he succeeds.  That seems to be the real lesson here, it's not that Evan just luckily makes some mistakes and comes out on top, it's that he tries over and over.<p>Success has very little to do with luck, a bit more to do with circumstance and mostly to do with trying, and trying and trying some more.",1236480677

That was not what I'm saying in that post. I was making an argument that moving expenses from upfront costs to ongoing expenses is not <i>necessarily</i> a good thing. It may or may not be. You're also assuming start-ups or small companies as customers. I'm also thinking of larger enterprises.<p>Many of the issues raised in your comments are addressed in the blog post itself and in the comment thread.",1236480308

I'm purposely preventing myself from trying to think hard on the purpose of your site.)<p>""I"" don't follow what your site does, even after I see the example. Something to do with retweets, which I thought was just sending someone else's tweet to my friends. But I enter some text and submit, nothing seems to happen. I alt-tab away and come back and a username/password field has appeared, with an empty text box and ""60"" number. I don't get it.<p>I give up, feeling dumb, and leave the site, to do whatever it was I was doing before.",1236480100

506946,comment,505982,506799,0,0,endtime,,,"Meh.  If I understand you correctly, you're saying that a humanities PhD might not have practical value, but it has value to some people because they like it and come out of it more worldly.  I mean, sure, okay, but there is a qualitatively different type of advantage that comes with a technical PhD.",1236479692
506945,comment,505982,506593,0,0,endtime,,,">It's worth noting that you can and should apply #7 - Most jobs are better than they seem: You can learn from any job - to grad school as well and treat it as a job with a long term contract, one that you need to mine for all kinds of interesting things that you didn't think you'd learn. For example, I bet a lot of people (understandably) go into a top neuroscience or cell biology program thinking they'll learn a lot about biology and research, and they do, but the ones that did really well learned things like how to manage your time well, motivate yourself on an independent schedule, network in a loose non-corporate environment and blow off steam with non-contact sports.<p>Very good point.  I'm learning a lot about CS, but I'm also learning my limits in terms of how much work I can do in general, and how to handle being overwhelmed.  I'm making excellent contacts.  I'm learning to organize myself better (and actually use a calendar).  Even without the CS, I will leave grad school better prepared for the workplace than I came in.",1236479538

506943,comment,505982,506802,0,0,endtime,,,"Agreed 100%.  TAing a class with 240 students is no joke (no, I'm not the only TA).  I am looking forward to my summer internship because I think it's going to be a lot more relaxing than school.  I'll have time to buy my own groceries (vs. Safeway delivery), I'll only work five days a week, I will be able to sleep 6-7 hours ever night, etc.  Being a grad student is very unlike being an undergrad.<p>Plus, grad school finally got me to stop playing WoW - I suspect that if I'd gotten a job right out of undergrad I would still be playing.",1236479325

""Similarly, founders should also should not get hung up on deal terms""
Either 'Similarly, founders should also not...' or 'Similarly, founders also should not...'
Didn't want to detract from the message of the piece, but thought it worth pointing out in case it helps.",1236478867

They are participating in the very activity you and I consider abhorrent (while also doing productive things, too).  In fact, Google very likely makes more money from domain squatting than anyone, since they have a very strong unfair search engine advantage over spam domains from any other provider.",1236477710

There was only 1 new feature in iOS 4 (that also worked on 3G models) that attracted me anyway: the unified mailbox view thing.<p>Actually I have a short list of desired improvements that might make it worth it, despite a speed drop:<p>* photo synching to my desktop (so not limited to the lame select-up-to-4-then-email-them thing, which is way too time-consuming if you have many photos and/or add new ones frequently)<p>* in Safari, when hit Add Bookmark, and goes into the Bookmarks view, it should start in the top-level collapsed state, that way I can quickly navigate to the right folder to select. Divide and conquer would speed it up in the case where there are many nested folder categories.<p>* making the Back button in Safari take you back to a cached, post-rendered view of the previous page -- rather than having to re-fetch/parse/render all over again, wasting my time, battery and the network (<i>groan</i>)<p>* cached application state restoration in general, consistently -- i realize the critical ingredient here is partly having enough memory and flash, so just beefing up the hardware with each new model refresh should get us to an ideal state eventually. Right now, lots of frustration and wasted effort when I go back in Mail and Safari and it's forgotten where I was last at and has to redo everything, sometimes reseting to some default state (such as scrolled to the extreme top rather than down in the middle where I was)",1277247516

1453508,comment,1453130,1453130,0,0,vishaldpatel,,,"Here's what I think about exercise:
Find a sport or activity that'll make you move: salsa dancing counts! ;-) (golf doesn't.. unless you're walking the whole damn course :P). When you get bored, find another fun sport or activity! =). You might even end up finding complimentary activities (I like to swim and go sailing - swimming helps when your boat capsizes, hahaha).<p>As far as eating is concerned, here's what I suggest:<p>- Figure out what you usually eat.<p>- Now figure out what you need (in terms of proteins, vitamins, minerals etc..), and figure out whether your current diet is providing what you need.<p>- If you have been getting everything you need in your current diet but are gaining fat, figure out what you can start cutting back on.<p>- If you are deficient in your daily intake nutrients but are also gaining fat, then figure out what you can add to your diet to complete the right nutrient intake, and what you can start cutting back on.<p>All this diet and exercise shit is a bit evolutionary. Just stick to it, build it up over time. Don't be too hard on yourself but don't give up or go easy either.",1277247462

The technical section of the webpage[1] directly addresses most of the problems that the RS-232 devices I looked into a number of years ago had; namely it detects when the diodes are going bad, and tries to not exceed the estimated entropy rate (the RS-232 devices just blindly XORed them together at a predefined bitrate; boxes typically had 4 diodes, since 1 or more was bad in almost all shipping boxes).  My experience was so bad with those devices though that I would want to spend a lot of time with any HW device before trusting it.<p>1) <a href=""http://www.entropykey.co.uk/tech/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.entropykey.co.uk/tech/</a>",1277247433

You could probably contact an Accenture recruiter to get an ""official"" answer. The following is just my opinion.<p>If you currently have what it takes to get hired by Accenture, doing a couple of years at a startup is probably not going to hurt your chances of being hired later, but it probably <i>won't</i> help you get much of a ""jump start"".  The early years at Accenture focus on ""acculturating"" you to the consulting life (and specifically in how Accenture does things).  Most of the big consultancies follow this approach, as a consistent approach is a key success factor for them (much the same reason why the military gives everyone the same basic training). In some cases the big consultancies <i>will</i> hire someone in at a senior level, but typically this is for people with industry-recognized expertise.<p>BTW, my advice would be to take the start-up role, unless you need the steady income of a corporate job (e.g., you already have a family to support).

The official Google Voice Andorid app, however, does require a voice plan to initiate the call.  It's an artificial restriction.  3rd party Google Voice dialers on the Android Market, including Evan Charlton's unofficial ""GV"" app, are able to place GV calls from an Android device without voice service, presumably by interacting with an undocumented API or via http requests to the Google Voice web site.<p>Blocking this feature is an example of how Google bent over for the wireless carriers at the expense of their users and contradicts Google's position on good/evil.

1453362,comment,1453005,1453319,0,0,xenophanes,,,"> Are you saying babies should not be controlled?<p>Most of the time a parent and his child agree about who should control something. The parent pays for the baby's food and the baby doesn't object. This is not ""control"" in the relevant sense because the baby prefers it be this way. And other times the baby decides on the location of his rattle. He exercises some control over his life and his parent is fine with that.<p>The interesting case -- and the one where the notion of an adult controlling a child is most relevant and meaningful -- is when there is a disagreement. Then if the adult, say, unplugs the TV to prevent the child playing GTA, against the child's will, he is taking control of the situation and exercising control over the child's life.<p>A wide variety of excuses are given for adults controlling children as a react to disagreements. One particularly generic and offensive one is ""kids don't think so good"". This sometimes takes more specific forms, e.g. ""kids don't think so good on the specific issue of differentiating between virtual reality and reality"" (btw, ironically, most adults are extremely bad at that same issue in some different forms, e.g. they don't really understand that when they ""see"" a chair the visual image is a VR rendering inside their head).<p>Anyway, here is a fact that, ahem, adults often mess up and which many young children intuitively seem to grasp: if we accept that the ratio of stuff adults are right about to stuff children are right about is 1000:1, it <i>does not follow</i> that <i>in a disagreement</i> the adult is right (or probably right). This is because disagreements do not happen in a random sample of cases. Disagreements only happen when both parties judge that they have relevant information that the other hasn't properly taken into account.<p>In disagreements, it's nothing but sheer unadulterated arrogance (and irrationality) to assume one is right.

1453347,comment,1453035,1453273,0,0,sreque,,,"Well, I can list a couple of things off the top of my head. For reference, I use both Chrome and Firefox on Linux at work and at home, and I have Chrome exclusively installed on my windows partition at home. I am trying to keep my windows install at home light, so I install as few things as possible. Also, I picked Chrome for windows because I wanted to get used to it more.<p>1. My biggest usability preference for Firefox is the 3.0-and-above address bar in Firefox. I discovered it by accident, but it has probably had more effect on my browsing of the web than any other recent browser feature. With it, I almost never have to fuss with bookmarks or type in the full URL of a web site. The address bar is absolutely amazing at guessing where I want to go based on one or two simple keywords. Chrome, on the other hand, always seems over-eager to give me the google search results for what I'm typing, doesn't handle things like out-of-order/non-contiguous keyword matching as well, doesn't prioritize previously visited web pages high enough, and doesn't order shorter matching prefixes on top, among other things.<p>2. As a computer-savvy person, I prefer firefox's more standard interface of having a menu bar on top. I also find it easier to configure Firefox, as again, it's editing windows work like most other programs I'm used to. That's not to say I don't like any other alternative UI's. I love, for instance, the ribbon interface in Office 2007 and I still feel like I can find my way around in it.<p>On a similar note, I also don't really like how Chrome's configuration is managed in separate tabs in web pages. I prefer the again more standard modal dialogues, separate windows, and native style widgets that Firefox uses. I feel like this appropriately separates Firefox-specific things from the rest of the web.<p>I see a major difference in purpose here between the two browsers. Firefox wants to fit in with the rest of your OS. Chrome wants to pretend your OS doesn't even exist.<p>3. I feel like I can manage Firefox bookmarks much better. I prefer, for instance, that added bookmarks not go to the bookmarks bar by default. Also, if I want, I can always drag and drop the current tab onto the primary bookmarks bar if I want to. Lastly, because of the location of the bookmarks menu, I know I can easily access bookmarks with alt+b and then use the arrow keys to find my bookmark, or I can even hop to bookmarks based on their first letter. This essentially allows me to access all bookmarks without even touching the mouse.<p>4. Firefox's search interface feels nicer. I like how the search bar shows up at the bottom left and spans the entire width of the screen. I believe it is less likely to be intrusive at the bottom as a lot of pages have right-columns. The fact that it spans the entire width makes it easier to notice the bar in the first place if you are new and have no idea where the search bar would show up.<p>Also, I like how options like case sensitivity and highlight-toggling are immediately visible, how alt+n and alt+p move forward and backwards, and how all of these and other options have underlines as the standard affordance for their alt-shortcuts. I know that enter/shift+enter work for both browsers for navigation, but there is no affordance for that. Lastly, for the VIMer inside me, Firefox responds to / for quick find! If that isn't cool, I don't know what is :).<p>There are probably other things, but these stick out at the moment.",1277244329

We all read the article that is posted at the top right? A long discussion about Super Smash Brothers and how all of its characters were ranked by players, and how the rank of the characters changed over a long period of time as players figured out how to play them and interact with the environment? The <i>author</i> of that piece used that definition of unbalanced. I just happened to like it, or resonate with it as I wrote, because in my experience playing World of Warcraft for years and years. Changes that the developers made in the character abilities, primarily it seemed to address player vs player perceptions of &quot;balance&quot; (which was the term the WoW developers used), made all of the characters nearly uniform in their effective capabilities. So when the WoW developers said &quot;the character classes/races/roles are more balanced in this patch&quot; the experience was that the game was &quot;less interesting&quot; to me. There was an interesting metric for that which was a characters &quot;rotation&quot; which was code for the sequence of commands the character would use in battle, which the more &quot;balanced&quot; the game became, the more uniform/boring that sequence became[1].<p>That said, it sounds like Guilty Gear is a lot of fun. And yes, that sort of global diversification is something I really like in a game and it keeps it interesting to me. And to your point having diverse capabilities that do not map 1:1 on the characters is part of the charm. And that is part of the charm of Super Smash Brothers which started this conversation. So after all this wonderful discussion I think we just figured out we agree with each other :-)<p>[1] Jokes about Paladin&#x27;s having a single &#x27;i win&#x27; key they just pounded again and again, or simplifying the user interface to three buttons, &#x27;fight&#x27;, &#x27;farm&#x27;, and &#x27;cyberz&#x27;",1416589071

It turns out the bazaar can&#x27;t create a polished user-friendly product, period.<p>Nevertheless, Red Hat and Canonical and others continue to try to foster desktop linux, on the now-obvious misguided theory that (a) the desktop matters and (b) they can take share from windows and osx installations.<p>As a result, there&#x27;s hundreds of terrible paid desktop programmers, and thousands of their users, who are dying every day because, e.g., the last several iterations of wireless networking scripts were written by morons, their graphics libraries are comically bad, etc., etc.<p>Into this charged mix of total incompetence and frustration comes a small group of mediocre coders with hubris, backing, and political nous.  And what they are promising to the long-abused desktop users sounds amazing to them, like wizardly magic, and literally, and almost entirely, boils down to this: freedom from having to deal with the shitty wireless networking script system.  No joke.  That is the fundamental issue at play, and the driver behind &quot;faster boot times&quot;, &quot;socket activation&quot;, and all of the other marketing points.  If that idiot who wrote the wireless provisioning scripts had been competent, this entire mess would never have happened.<p>So the desktop linux users and desktop linux developers, who again have been living in a tiny cage being pooped on every day by their own regrettable choices, reach for this solution with the religious fervor of a drowning victim.  And since desktop linux developers tend to be the C team, they don&#x27;t care about good architecture, they just want things to work for them and their very specific desktop linux use case, which objectively and axiomatically, again, has not worked for decades and will never work.<p>So they band together in unison, following the exciting, energetic, charismatic and opinionated lead developer.  And obviously, Red Hat is delighted, because that&#x27;s their employee, and maybe they get more market share.  And they pack Debian with developers, because there&#x27;s a ton of horrible little desktop linux apps that grant them votes, and shout down the opposition.  And they set up an IRC channel, and they brigade every forum with the same nonsensical attacks on the very architecture that made it possible for the internet to happen in the first place.  Including, obviously, this very thread.<p>In actuality, this group of users is vanishingly tiny compared with the linux installed base, which is mostly phones and servers, where the real action is, and which don&#x27;t need this halfassed dbus nonsense or the accreting blob of carelessly rewritten known-good-daemons.  The desktop linux people are chasing a dead target with a terrible design and religious fervor substituted for technical ability.  It will be intriguing to watch it play out.  FreeBSD is about to get a big positive jolt of people that know what &#x27;good&#x27; is.",1416587915

Artwork requires a continuous investment of creative energy, otherwise it is replaced by the work of other artists.

Artists cross-license their work to creators that work in different media, such as book authors optioning movie rights to film studios.<p>Works in the public domain get remixed into more contemporary works.

Here&#x27;s those points again:<p>- Dart is very toolable and has a great IDE experience in a number of IDEs already: IntelliJ/WebStorm, Eclipse, the Dart Editor, Sublime, etc.<p>- The semantics are much more sane and predictable than JavaScript: objects are closed; Dart has class-based inheritance with interfaces and mixins; type coercion is eliminated and thus predictable; arrays are real arrays, bound checked and can&#x27;t have holes; &#x27;this&#x27; is lexically bound; accessing a undefined property throws an exception rather than propagating undefined through your program; there are no top-level statements, so startup is predictable; and on and on...<p>- Dart&#x27;s syntax combined with interfaces allow for really great libraries, and Dart&#x27;s core libraries and dart:html take full advantage of that. [] is separate from property access, so Lists, Maps, and Sets have nice-to-use interfaces. There can be multiple implementations of List, Map, etc. It&#x27;s possible to write delegate/wrapper/proxy classes, etc. Dart&#x27;s core libraries are a joy to use.<p>- Static type warnings and checked mode helps developers write correct programs.

The naive approach would be to assume that the latter is one big market, and proceeding to rank households based on their willingness and ability to pay a wash machine repairman.<p>In reality, there are a plethora of potential market segments which are based on criteria that do not in any way relate to price.<p>In light of a leaky wash machine, for instance, a household&#x27;s options include:<p>- Calling in for the warranty if it&#x27;s not expired<p>- Simply putting a bucket and continuing on with the broken machine<p>- Getting the leak fixed by the household tinkerer (or a friend or relative who tinkers)<p>- Buying a new wash machine<p>- Going to the laundromat from that point forward<p>- Etc.<p>- Calling the repairman<p>Point being: you want to properly identify which segments are indeed a good fit, prior to ranking them by their willingness and ability to pay.<p>In addition (in my experience anyway), these two steps are best taken care by interacting (email, chat, phone, face to face) with potential clients: not doing so introduces multiple risks, including coming up with a product that does not match their needs, under- or overpricing it, and -- perhaps most importantly -- missing out on opportunities to identify higher-value niches who you can up-sell things to.",1416586560

My tax dollars are paying for it. So, I bought an antenna. It couldn&#x27;t pick up any stations in my apartment, and this is a very common problem in NYC.

Aereo provided me with a cloud-based antenna, no different than buying one from Best Buy or Amazon.<p>Only:<p>(a) the signal was clear and reliable, not fuzzy.

The net effect of the model is that a third party ISP&#x27;s variable costs are essentially the cost of their interconnect with the incumbent, and are dominated by their burst needs during peak usage times. As a consequence, there are a number of business models which this lends itself to (in terms of incentivizing users to shift usage to off-peak times) in addition to straight download cap vs. unlimited offerings.\nFor example, some ISPs (like Teksavvy, for example) offer unlimited plans with a reduction in speed during peak hours.<p>There was a LOT of debate on the subject on places like dslreports when this was in front of the CRTC. The general consensus seemed to be that UBB\nin principle is a good thing (it allows for more flexibility in third party ISP business models, and roughly aligns costs with income for the incumbent) although the particular tariff prices put forth by the incumbents were inflated and suspect.<p>As a real-world benchmark, my third party provider (start.ca) offers a 30/5 cable plan with 200GB of usage for $45 CAD (roughly $40 USD) per month. Going to an unlimited plan adds an extra $15 CAD to that, with the risk for overages being borne by the ISP.<p>Of course, the incumbents&#x27; retail offerings are universally terrible (their caps are laughably small, and their prices higher than any third party provider). Because of the lack of separation between their retail and wholesale operations, they&#x27;re able to offer (presumably loss leader) promotions that third party providers simply can&#x27;t, and have the benefit of being able to structure their tariff offerings to screw third party providers wherever possible. So that part of the regulatory environment sucks.<p>Overall though it feels like a decent model (although the actual tariff prices are quite out of line, particularly for interconnect fees). $60 CAD a month for unlimited 30/5 is a fair price in my mind, and if my needs ever change there are enough third party provider with enough diverse business models that I&#x27;d likely find something that works for me.",1416586114

Um.... try everyone!<p>Sure we want that... and we also want newer, better things. That&#x27;s a tug of war between comfort and progress. If all we did were laser-focus on reliable, familiar interfaces and predictable functionality we never would have gotten the GUI or the mouse, right?<p>> A-B testing won&#x27;t reveal how many people reluctantly embrace the change, rolled their eyes and cursed your service as they completed the task. A-B testing is not all-knowing. It&#x27;s suitable for colder functional changes, not things such as key separators on a virtual keyboard.<p>I completely agree. My point was to home in on what you would characterize as change. Your response was very helpful to that end.<p>> None of this would be a problem if users are simply given choice and meticulous control over the changes and how or whether they&#x27;re applied. Choice, control, options and user preferences - those should be the key features.<p>Yeah, it would be comforting if the gmail app let users toggle between &quot;classic&quot; and &quot;material&quot;... and it would also be contrary to that which is (seemingly) the driving force behind Material Design: defragmentation of UX in the Android space.<p>Choice is a double-edged sword. Several studies suggest that choice overload reduces happiness, increases stress, and leads to poorer decision-making.[1] On the other hand, one study found that choice overload caused all of those reactions but also positively affected their perceived quality of the brand.[2]<p>We HNers are a niche of tinkerers who enjoy poring through settings.

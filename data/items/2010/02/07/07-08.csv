I am designing the system to be as fault tolerant and self-healing as possible so I do not have to have people (read: me) awakened at 3AM with alerts.<p>Maybe I'm insane or overly optimistic or both. Designing things to bend and not break is really difficult and time consuming.  ""Thanks Captain Obvious! You are so insightful!""

It's accessible through a free API - www.seomoz.org/api - up to 1 million calls a month free and more at fairly low rates. Our index isn't quite Google-sized. Our last crawl (updated once per month) was 65 billion URLs, which we estimate is between 50-65% of Google's main index.<p>I'm happy to answer any other questions you've got about it if you'd like.

And then I took a deep breath and re-read it.<p>So, first - You're taking an unpopular position, suggesting that the future of everything isn't HTML5 - but you do so coherently.<p>But, the thing is, HTML5 isn't a replacement for thick binaries - I don't believe anyone has suggested that you are going to replace Excel, Photoshop, or AutoCad with an HTML5 App.  But, with that said, not everyone needs all the power of those Thick Binaries - lots of people get by with Google Docs, Zimbra, Numbers, and other applications that are ""good enough.""  (Please, before anyone tells me that these applications are competitors for their thick binaries - Tell me how many thousands of hours you've spent on them.  Any Excel/Cad/Photoshop Jockey not only knows precisely how limited those applications are, but they also find their smaller competitors unuseable.  )<p>I'm guessing 95% plus of the non-productivity application needs can be solved by HTML5 or it's close companions.   What _is_ going to be replaced is Flash.  Particularly with the iPad about to come out strong (Mossberg thought it would sell millions of units when priced at $999, with the entry at $779 - He didn't even hazard a guess at what Apple is going to be able to do with a $499 machine) - people who want to write cross platform WebApps are going to _master_ HTML5, particularly with Google and Apple both driving WebKit so hard - now you get Chromium + iPad in one fell swoop - pretty hard to ignore that target environment.<p>Re: 99% of machines - Probably pretty close to it.  How many machines out there can't run a reasonably recent version of FireFox - I'll admit there is a lot of them, but most machines in the last five years probably can.",1265528794

1107396,comment,1102594,1104981,0,0,silencio,,,"Oh huh. That is interesting, because I was always convinced I can never charge too little here when I need a lot of money to begin with to live in such an area. (Just the other day I found out my health insurance company was going to charge me $100/month <i>more</i>...almost making me consider getting a job instead or finishing school...)<p>> Here's the thing with project rates - I'm obsessive with clocking time. I clock everything, every second.<p>I am too ;) I use Billings or Harvest (depending on where I'm working) to time everything obsessively. I don't actually bill anyone based on purely the time, but it gives me a sense of how much time it took me to do certain things because if I end up spending way too much time hand-holding a client then something needs to change. DO NOT get into the habit of <i>not</i> clocking things like responding to client emails (other than like short one liner type things) and whatever, because you are right...it can be a huge time suck, and it's hard to estimate how much time that will end up taking. Whoever originally came up with the idea of quoting in excess of what you really think it is time and money wise was smart ;)<p>> But having Java and Perl skills are definitely more valuable than just PHP... And yes, having established, stable and valuable clients with big $$ over the long term certainly helps.<p>I don't even really know that much Perl...Java I learned in school, I'm trying to do more Cocoa/Mac/iPhone/(iPad?) stuff now that the iPhone has really kicked that off because I wasn't really doing anything with it since I had first played with cocoa/objc in like 2005-6...I know bits and pieces. I usually won't take on a job involving something I don't know much about, but my scattered knowledge does come in handy as I can be extremely flexible in getting things done the way people want them. So yeah, if PHP is your only skill, you should branch out if at least to be qualified for more jobs out there.<p>Established clients are far more important, and I'm sorry to hear that :( I'm <i>trying</i> to work on a startup right now, but it's hard because I have to pay my own bills, cofounder can't quit her job yet, and other such little things... But keeping up relationships, if only to have lunch and say hi, is a good thing to do with your best clients. It's a tough time for everyone right now and has been for a while, don't worry :)",1265526598

A physicist could do it with much less work.  In a dodgy approximation, the impulse on a body due to a fluid is proportional to the momentum of the fluid that hits it.  If each cone falls with the same velocity, the momentum is proportional to the mass of fluid that hits it, which is proportional to the cone's area.  Differentiating with respect to time, the drag force is proportional to area.",1265526579

We are not interacting in a tactile way with our environment - not like we used to.  So perhaps what&#x27;s happening is that maybe AMSR viewers are yearning for the authenticity of touch that we are losing.  This to me seems why watching someone paint their nails would be so potent for some people.<p>Might need a neurologist to weigh in now.<p>[1] <a href=""http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionDesign"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/#!/ABriefRantOnTheFutureOfInteractionD...</a>",1418288398

It would probably be more like 21,2%.<p>But because it stuck around and gained traction, it is now a sort of &quot;default&quot; for non-credit card payment. Which explains the 370% figure.<p>But PayPal is &quot;evil&quot; and we know this. It is a centralized outside your control. It can seize the funds in your account. It can be corrupted by governments. It can be instructed into what it can and can&#x27;t support by credit-card companies, etc etc.<p>That not how currency is supposed to work. You own it. You exchange it. You give it to who you like to give it to. Your money is yours to do with as you please.<p>So we need a new approach which addresses the centralized nature of PayPal and the ownership issue of the funds.

I&#x27;ve not had to change the Postgres schema for over a year and it&#x27;s easy to upgrade schemas inline while fetching from the app. We did write our own migration tools, but they&#x27;re only a couple of pages of code.<p>I don&#x27;t understand your complaint about lack of transactional DDL when using JSON. It&#x27;s still there, though probably not as important as most of your upgrades will only touch data, giving you transactional upgrades (should you desire them) in any database.<p>DB queries of JSON data are definitely slow in 9.3 as the values need to be parsed every query, but the lack of JSON equality has not been a problem. You simply use the double chevron text extraction operators rather than the the json extraction operators in your query, col->foo->>bar rather than col->foo->bar. From there you can cast to any type and join to other tables.<p>For us, the big advantage of using a generalized schema has been simple support for recording versions of data. With over 30 different content types doing this with a traditional relational schema would have resulted in maybe 90 tables. Our generic schema has six.<p>I&#x27;m really looking forward to 9.4 as it will make ad-hoc queries across JSONB really fast using GIN indexes. I&#x27;d love to see the option of creating check / foreign-key constraints on JSON data in the future.

There is also a problem of getting large groups of people and organizations to agree on something. This also slows down progress in some open/free projects. Sometimes it is easier to just decide for yourself.",1418286719

Albeit, unofficial, the number of jobs created by a shadow economy of €253bn is too large to ignore. Now, 25% of GDP is underground economy, and 25% unemployment seem to have something in common, don&#x27;t you think? The problem to me seems to be a budget balance issue: how can Governments pay for services that a large number of the population uses,  but doesn&#x27;t pay. This, in my opinion is what is causing a collapse: lack of funds to pay for services, and obligations (debt), and loose cost/investment policies.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/spain-black-economy-gdp-growth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/jan/30/spain-black-...</a>",1418286654

Then somebody came in with a big mechanical keyboard several months later and started clonking away, and I enjoyed that, too. The unevenness of the clicks and clacks make little patters and pops in my head that are like tiny little itch bubbles that are scratchpopped the same moment they blip into existence.<p>These are sounds I used to find extremely annoying and I don&#x27;t know why it changed. But when I started looking up mechanical keyboard sounds on youtube so that I could listen to them at home, I came across these ASMR videos and discovered that apparently, it&#x27;s a thing.<p>For me, in-person sounds are always more satisfying. They are less predictable and less uniform. The videos some people try to make to capture the ASMR feeling have the idea right, but are not uneven enough. It&#x27;s like when you ask someone to write 50 iterations of a coin flip and they end up having max substrings of the same character in a row that are only 2 characters long. Real randomness isn&#x27;t like that - you&#x27;ll have some 4&#x27;s and 5&#x27;s, and 1&#x27;s with wide padding.<p>I think if you don&#x27;t already feel this phenomenon yourself, watching some ASMR videos to discover what it&#x27;s like will probably not give you the feeling. It&#x27;s like eating a food you always hated, or jazz music - you don&#x27;t like it until suddenly, one day sitting there, you realize that you probably would if you tried it again. And then you go, and you do. Before that, you don&#x27;t really get the appeal. It&#x27;s just the fermentation of the brain. After a certain amount of time, it just has a different taste.<p>For me, in these whisper videos, it&#x27;s not the soft voice that triggers the feeling, but the clicks in the speech - the &quot;sk&quot; and &quot;st&quot; sounds, and simple pops of the tongue while it&#x27;s being rearranged in the mouth between words.

It was a toggle any webmaster could throw, with no support/maintenance effort required at IA.<p>It obviously sucks now, more than a decade after it was adopted as a quick fix, but would take some dedicated policy and technical design to gracefully replace. For example, many rightsholders may be relying on the old behavior. But, the IA hasn&#x27;t yet been able to prioritize creation of a new scheme.<p>A new process could involve a policy where someone claiming to be the original site/content rightsholder asserts that as of some boundary date, for example when they ceded or sold the domain, later robots.txt should not affect earlier content. (Such a boundary could also be clearly-indicated in Wayback summary/calendar pages.) Then, presumption would flip to showing the earlier content, <i>unless</i> some other rightsholder (such as the current domain-holder) formally claims (&quot;under penalty of perjury&quot;, etc) that it&#x27;s their material and they wish the block to stay in place.<p>It&#x27;d be a bit in overall shape like the DMCA takedown/counter-notify procedure, as if the robots.txt was a sloppy takedown request. Squatters making a false claim to ownership of older content would be forced to go on record and take some risk. Ideally any dispute could then proceed between the other two parties, leaving the IA out of it. Again, this would be similar to how the DMCA tries to leave ISPs/caches/hosters out of takedown legal battles.<p>I doubt most new domain-owners are strongly or consciously trying to hide the past; it&#x27;s usually an automatic choice made for other reasons. A few <i>might</i> be holding the history hostage to make ownership of the domain more valuable – &quot;buy it to re-access the past&quot;. Some others might be embarrassed of the previous unaffiliated content – but a clearer Wayback UI indicating changes-of-management could help allay that concern. Unfortunately, for both good and bad reasons, there is no easy/reliable/canonical source of all domain-ownership info over time.",1418285814

Fake Google accounts created to create fake &quot;+1&quot;s may have exceeded the number of real ones. Google &quot;+1&quot; are still for sale; the going rate is about $0.10 each.<p>Meanwhile, links aren&#x27;t as useful as they used to be. Who creates a link to a retail outlet other than on social media any more?  Google is trying all sorts of &quot;signals&quot;, but in heavily spammed areas, they&#x27;re not doing all that well.<p>Yandex has been trying search that doesn&#x27;t weight links at all for some heavily spammed categories in the Moscow area.  It seems to be working for fake real estate ads.<p>(We have a partial solution - find the real-world business behind the web site and check it out in hard data sources, such as Dun and Bradstreet or Experian, which have business credit data.

Then, for less critical things that can run as separate services, try out the new things.  That way people in a team can also get exposure to the new technologies and you can experience first hand the pros and cons of these technologies.  Some people are more generally optimistic about new things which solves some of the frustrations they have with the old things (or perhaps their lack of experience and understanding of the old things), without realising there will be new problems that comes with the new solutions that haven&#x27;t even been identified yet, never mind workarounds or solutions to these new, and yet unknown, problems.  However, I think the biggest, while also avoidable, risk is usually adopting the new thing for a problem you don&#x27;t even have.  A lot of distributed databases exist because you are going to have a lot of concurrent users access similar data, related to themselves mostly, accessed at the same time, or have a lot of user data that you want to do big, ad-hoc searches and analysis across all the data.  If you don&#x27;t have the scale of &#x27;a lot&#x27; or &#x27;concurrent&#x27; or &#x27;across all the data&#x27; that these things are designed to address, you might not even need this solution and especially not all the tradeoffs you have to make along with it.  I agree it&#x27;s an exciting time, and a time of discovery for everyone, but there will be many things learned the hard way and it&#x27;s tricky to position yourself here especially when there&#x27;s pressure around you.",1418285489

8733718,comment,8733368,8733538,0,0,MichaelGG,,,"Vending machines will almost certainly have cameras. And incautious use could still leave DNA or fingerprints. Best anonymity is to mail cash to a LocalBitcoin seller. Take care to get unregistered bills (ATMs and bank withdrawals <i>could</i> trace serial numbers, though WF claims they do not). Get big bills, then shop for change. Take great care in preparing the envelope. Consider using a remailer. Some post offices will even do that for you. Address it to the postmaster, and include a ready piece of mail inside. And remember, the seller could be an operative of whoever you&#x27;re trying to keep anonymous from.<p>Biggest issues are A: your general geo location is known (though remailing adds one more party to penetrate, OTOH, if the post scans every piece of mail, auto correlation could be easy). B: buying stamps is getting harder, anonymously. Cameras all over. Automatic machines require credit cards.<p>Source: I was thinking of operating a hidden service for hosting. I wanted to see how much work it actually was for potential customers to buy anonymous BTC and spent a few days attempting to do so. For people wanting to have strong (state level) security, it seems very difficult to get it right.<p>Edit: A real solution is, if zero knowledge proofs are real and can scale, is to have an active market that uses that tech. Then you go and trade in and out and can get lost in the noise, if enough transactions are occurring. But we&#x27;d need serious buy in, otherwise it&#x27;s pretty unique behavior.

A profitable bootstrap (as I gather this is) is a rare enough thing that you don&#x27;t want to abandon it.

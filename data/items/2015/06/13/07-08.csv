I&#x27;ve seen napkin calculations where that&#x27;s possible, but the other side of the question of course is the payout.  Most &#x27;realistic&#x27; estimates I&#x27;ve personally seen of that don&#x27;t necessarily assume that a UBI will provide above a very basic living.  There&#x27;s usually the intention of incentivizing additional income, but the UBI at least provides the security to be selective in the job market or promote risk taking in ventures.  By the way, it&#x27;s also apparently commonly held among economists that the LVT is a very efficient tax with low evasion.  The difficulty in implementation has historically been considered to be land valuation itself, but recent advances in things like GIS apparently make high resolution valuation feasible.",1434182149

9710222,comment,9705830,9706968,0,0,kw71,,,"Data on radio channels is common!  All you need is a &quot;radio&quot; and a &quot;modem,&quot; and there are many variants of either.<p>These kinds of radio channels are already allocated to &#x27;business&#x27; or &#x27;government&#x27; service by the FCC.  The user has licensed the use of one or more in a specific geographical area.  These channels are 2.5kHz wide, but the old fashion was 5kHz bandwidth.  They were allocated with FM audio in mind, which is what the portable radios do.  You&#x27;re normally allowed to run data on these channels.<p>The radio used at each node is probably a &quot;mobile&quot; radio intended for mounting in a vehicle but configured as a kind of base station by adding a DC power supply.  Motorola has been selling microprocessor controlled, frequency-synthesized radios since the early 1980&#x27;s, and the earliest one I know of used a 6800 processor (actually Hitachi 6300 series clone of M&#x27;s cpu).  The channel is probably shared with the maintenance chatters because the county already had the license, a radio fleet, and a shop to maintain the radios.  By changing a &quot;CTCSS&quot; or &quot;PL&quot; tone to one that is different to the ones used by the voice radios, the maintenance chatters don&#x27;t have to hear squawks and whistles all day and night.<p>The modem is probably an FSK kind of modem with a rate of something like 1200 bps.  This works by representing 0 and 1 with different audio tones and is very simple with complete integrated silicon available during the 1980&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s interfaced to the radio&#x27;s audio input and output, the computer/modem needs a way to cause the radio to transmit, and it is nice to have a signal to show whether the radio channel is busy or idle.  Otherwise it is probably a serial interface to the local controller at each site.  The modem itself may have a microprocessor to do simple tasks like ensure the transmitter does not get stuck on by a fault or to prevent transmitting when the radio is receiving a signal already.<p>As far as the protocol goes, it can be anything and is probably something extremely simple: My address, length, payload, checksum.",1434180903

So I&#x27;ll answer assuming you&#x27;re junior but you&#x27;ve been doing this for at least a year, you can write good code and good English, you&#x27;re working 8 hour days, you&#x27;re in Sydney or Melbourne, and you contract out to an agency doing work for mid-size companies.<p>I&#x27;d say you are at the very very low end of the scale, if not falling off the scale. If you have any skill in front-end JS, and aren&#x27;t a trainee or a recent graduate with zero experience, you should be getting twice that money easily.<p>For a comparison, I do back-end and devops work, and I charge in the range between $85 and $175 per hour (1), depending on the client and the work. Right now I have a project of each. I suspect I&#x27;m also undercharging some clients, and that intermediaries who genuinely can&#x27;t pay me more are also undercharging. However, I don&#x27;t work for recruiters/outsourcers, but directly for companies shipping software, though some of them are intermediaries in the sense that they run a project for a client, and then hire me as a contractor instead of as an employee. Also, I haven&#x27;t done almost any front-end work, but it&#x27;s my impression that front-end skills are in higher demand, and rates are higher on average.<p>(1) AUD, not USD.<p>You say you don&#x27;t have other people&#x27;s salaries to compare. I too wish Aussie JS and front-end freelancers shared their fees here. Here&#x27;s how to compare freelance day/hour rates to a full time salary, by the way:<p>A full time worker puts in about 2000 hours a year. As a freelancer, you have to put in your own training, sales (finding work), you pay your own superannuation (because you do, right?), equipment (you buy your own laptop), training (you buy your own books and courses, you pay your own way to attend conferences), etc.<p>Thus, when comparing your day rates with the money a full time worker gets, you should take into account extra benefits paid by their employer like super (for non-australians, this is a retirement account, by law employers&#x27; contributions are about 9%, but some companies pay more, up to the mid-10s), training courses and conferences, etc.<p>As a freelancer, you don&#x27;t have sickies or paid holiday of any kind, so you should account for 1000 billable hours a year. Working more is the cherry on top, and less is a risk that you hedge by having good rates.<p>Therefore, $85/hour is more or less equivalent to an $85.000/yr salary + benefits. $175/hour would be equivalent to $175.000/year salary + benefits.<p>Obviously this is without taking into account tax brackets, forced downtime if you have health issues, and the averaging of good and bad weeks/months/years. Also, perceptions of salaries/rates aren&#x27;t linear, neither for you nor for potential employers.<p>(((<p>Note: this advice is for an hourly rate programmer. HN legends patio11 and tptacek will rightly advise you to get out of this game if you can, and I agree with them. I&#x27;m trying to do it myself. But while you&#x27;re in it, this is what I&#x27;ve learnt that I can share.<p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-pro...</a><p><a href=""http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-mckenzie-on-getting-your-first-consulting-client/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/09/17/ramit-sethi-and-patrick-...</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6974166"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6974166</a><p>)))<p>There is a lot of the above advice that you start applying now while still in the hourly rate game, so I&#x27;m pasting the link to tptacek&#x27;s comment again, because it&#x27;s hella relevant and pithy.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6974166"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6974166</a><p>Good luck.

While I still programmed in assembly, Forth and C, I was one of the &quot;APL guys&quot; at work.<p>The language changes the way you solve problems computationally. It changes your focus away from the mechanics programming to inmerse your mind in the problem domain.  It is hard to understand this without working with APL for a year or more.<p>There&#x27;s another element here that is often ignored: Notation.<p>APL uses a unique set of symbols and it is these symbols that give you expressive power not found in text-based approaches.  A paper by Ken Iverson himself, titled &quot;Notation as a tool for thought&quot;, covers this:<p><a href=""http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jzhu/csc326/readings/iverson.pd...</a><p>The value of notation has been largely forgotten today due to the fact that APL suffered a popularity gap of probably twenty years due to the language being way ahead of technoloy at the time.  The language didn&#x27;t fail.  The hardware of the time did.<p>This, BTW, is the reason I think J is an absolute abomination.  Yes, Ken Iverson was behind J.  The motivation behind going for ASCII and losing the very symbols that made APL notation so powerful was to attempt to deal with the limitations of computers at the time. For example, on some systems you had to manually reprogram the graphic card&#x27;s character ROM just to be able to display the symbols.<p>Iverson sought to make the APL concept more accessible by transliterating to ASCII when creating J.  In doing so he utterly destroyed the very notation he understood to be critically valuable as a tool for thought.<p>For more than one reason it would be wrong to attempt to bring APL back today.  The concepts, the approach and a form of notation for the expression of computational concepts could and should come back.",1434179523

Basically even with asynchronous replication and a drastic merge function (last failover wins), you can still do things to improve the real world behavior of the system, and this is what we did:<p>1) Improve Redis master-slave protocol in order to have asynchronous acknowledges, at least. So it is now possible, during partitions, to have a bound data loss: after some time the isolated master stops accepting writes. This is implemented both in Redis Cluster (natively) and in Redis vanilla replication (so can be used with Sentinel or other failover mechanisms).<p>2) Use a replication offset in order to try, during failovers, to pick the slave with the most updated state.<p>Currently it is just an idea but in the future for certain data types and operations, Redis Cluster may take a log of the operations that were not acknowledged by all the slaves of a given master, and when the master is turned into a slave, it would re-play the log into the new master, at least for operations which are idempotent and commutative. This would allow for safer writes. The other (more used) approach of merging values directly is not very easy to perform with Redis for a number of reasons.",1434179417

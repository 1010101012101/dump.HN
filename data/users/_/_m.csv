Just as the LAMP stack enabled the modern web, the Nymote stack (aka MISO stack) will enable the &#x27;Internet of Everything&#x27;.<p><i>https://mirage.io (current)</i> --  MirageOS is the &#x27;M&#x27; in the MISO stack. A new approach to the Operating System where developers compose their applications by pulling in OS components as libraries (e.g networking, etc) and let the compiler deal with optimisation to produce lean, single-purpose VMs (aka Unikernels). The &#x27;I&#x27; in MISO is the Irmin, git-like data storage system.<p><i>http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/ocamllabs/io (alum)</i> -- Co-created this group to push OCaml forward and make it more effective by working on tooling, documentation and a Platform. I herded cats here.<p><i>http://www.springboard.com (now spun out)</i> -- Accelerator programme I set up in Cambridge in 2009. Worked with neilgd. Teams included PagerDuty (agmiklas, bpuvanathasan & alexsolo) and TidePowerd (profquail) among others.  Now being run by jdbradford. Merged with Techstars in Q1 2013.<p><i>http://www.tidepowerd.com (board member)</i> -- One of the Springboard teams that Red Gate invested in (profquail). Makes GPU computing accessible to .NET devs. Now shut down.<p><i>http://www.svc2uk.com</i> -- Student run series of events with folks from the Valley. Chaired by Sherry Coutu and Reid Hoffman.<p><i>http://www.go-test.it (now sold)</i> -- Red Gate acquisition. I worked with the founder, martinkl, who moved on to Rapportive (YC S10) with rahulvohra and samstokes. The assets were sold on.<p>---------------------------------",1249050242,1452580329

omarkhans,0,1,0.0,1,0,"I am a very determined technical and business minded entrepreneur person who wants to achieve a lot in life and I will achieve it. The best quote which has hung to me is that If you are born poor then its not your fault but if you die poor then its totally your fault. I will not die poor and will surely buy good houses, Ferrari's, R8's and all the fun stuff for me and my family. And more over I will make a name in this world which would be remembered for ever. I would not die as nobody.\nAbout me:\nI graduated from USC with my Master in Dec 2008 which was the worst time to graduate. I had job offers which got withdrawn. To support my self and my family I started some freelancing work for a consultant company which paid for my rent, food and bills. In addition I also started selling scrap metal and computer scrap on commission to Pakistan, Singapore and India. This was just out of nowhere when one of my friends asked me if I could find scrap for him. Luckily I knew something about the metal scrap business as it was very related to my fathers business. I spent many days and nights roaming around in LA, Texas, Bay area and N.Y to find scrap metal yards because scrap metal companies that were listed online were BIG and wanted high prices. SO for me to make some money I had to find the feeder scrap yards to these BIG companies. I was successful in bringing the company in to the market and to break even. It was and is a great learning experience. Got to know how to open a CORP, CITY permits, Business Permit, Taxes and many other legal and other logistical issues. To get it to work, I started giving references to my dad's company in Pakistan as people wanted guarantees that I was a legit person. I could have gone doing it further BUT I wanted to be part of the TECH industry as that is what I am by the love of technology. I wanted to do something I love the most. And that is TECH. So after an year I slowed down my business workings so that I can again apply for jobs in 2009 when the economy started picking up. Everyone says that was my worst decision. BUT I don't think so. Basically I did not want to look back at my life and feel that I took an easy way out and got into the family business. \nSo I head out and got a job as a developer in a Security company. At first they did not give me much to work on. I took projects on my own without waiting for them. I decided to make my/and the rest of the s-engineer's life easy. So I developed a log file analyzer with UI for parsing large log files. I had no clue about C# but learn it on the way. Everyone loved the tool as it helped analyzing and finding problems in 10GB-20GB Logs easily. From the first day my aim was to work in a TECH company so I can learn the infrastructure and the in and out of how a TECH company functions. I was successful in learning all the corporate linguistic and also was and have been getting better at programming, developing and thinking of new things everyday. I still am making my way ahead. I got promoted as a team lead for the security injection team which develops bots which do different type of attacks for web application vulnerability assessments. But everyday I feel I am working for someone else and not my self. I am helping a company to achieve what it dreams about BUT not helping my dreams succeed. All the hard work seems to be done by the engineers where as the upper management taking most of the credit and pay. I am not satisfied. \nSo to be happy I need to work for my self and need to find my own ground. I want to start my own company and will and prove my self that I can do it. And that's what I am working towards. I know I will get in to YC and I hope I do so in a reasonable time. Even if I dont that wont bring my moral down and I will still keep marching forward till I am standing. YC is my goal because to meet Paul Grahm would be one of the life experience which I dont want to miss.",1310183288,1452896423

smallbigfoot,0,1,0.0,0,0,"Started a lawn care business when I was 12 because I was bored and wanted money to buy some Pokemon cards so I knocked on my neighbors doors and soon had 10 clients.  I worked very hard all season long and by the end of the first season I had more than enough money to buy Pokemon cards and quite a bit left over.  So I decided to invest my newly earned money in the stock market.  I started researching what stocks would best meet my objectives and started trading (through a custodian account my parents set up).  I soon was making more money trading than mowing.  I kept both up while adding landscaping to the mix.  At age 22 I sold my landscaping business and started a software startup.  Now I trade stocks a few hours a day and work on my software startup the rest of the day/night.  I also graduated from Columbia College.",1363746680,1453175236

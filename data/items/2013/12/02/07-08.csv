I&#x27;ve been reading and reading and can&#x27;t believe it hasn&#x27;t been mentioned - the drone simply unreels the payload on a cable while hovering until it gets to the ground.

These pamphlets, however, were not written by victims of a bubble, but were primarily religiously motivated. The upheaval was viewed as a perversion of the moral order—proof that &quot;concentration on the earthly, rather than the heavenly flower could have dire consequences&quot;.[53] Thus, it is possible that a relatively minor economic event took on a life of its own as a morality tale.<p>^ From the same wiki page ^ No idea with the picture you reference where it&#x27;s from.<p>The point about economic theory is the market needs to be fluid. It says nothing about crazy people in a small private market(obvious I guess)<p>The &quot;Tulip&quot; craze seems to me to just be the normal fundamental dogma that you get when people don&#x27;t fully understand systems. People distorting instances that are not linked to push their views. To me the interesting thing is people 400 years ago also feared financial systems.",1385971127

Or both.<p>Mining Bitcoins is simply a search for an SHA256 hash matching a certain set of criteria. The mining hardware could theoretically be used to search for hash collisions faster than previously existing hardware, but that is of limited utility in the scenario of trying to find a specific hash collision (i.e. one that allows you to decrypt a file or login to a system) rather than one that meets certain qualifications (but doesn&#x27;t have to be an exact match for one unique hash).<p>The set of possible values is <i>so large</i> that even the next generation of ASIC mining hardware (which will continue the exponential growth of worldwide hashing power) would require hundred or thousands of years (I don&#x27;t know the specifics and can&#x27;t be bothered to find the numbers with specificity), on average, to find a specific hash. SHA256 is still strong, even assuming a vastly larger pool of searching machines.<p>In short: Bitcoin mining is not &quot;cracking&quot; SHA256. It&#x27;s gambling on finding a hash that has one specific (rare, but not even close to unique) characteristic. Finding one, just like winning at poker or at the roulette wheel, does not make the next round easier.",1385970147

Firstly, many parts of southern India are low-lying and will be affected by rising sea levels.  Then there&#x27;s the effect that India is in the tropical zone - they&#x27;ve already experienced devastating monsoons and this is only predicted to get worse (see Typhoon Yolanda) as time goes by.  Lastly, those glaciers aren&#x27;t far away, they&#x27;re right there in the Himalayas - India can expect to have major problems with drinking water supplies as those glaciers melt.<p>I&#x27;m not up with Indian politics, but I rather suspect that the current refusal to deal with emissions is more about climate change denialism mixed in with a sense of anti-colonial defiance than anything else.  Don&#x27;t forget that it&#x27;s actually easier, politically speaking, for a developing country such as India to adopt renewable energy than it is for the developed world, goodness knows they have the engineers to make it happen!  We <i>need</i> baseload power, our society has been constructed expecting it to exist, but as Indian populations get electricity, it&#x27;s not going to be a major drama if electricity supply is intermittent - that&#x27;s still way better than no electricity at all.",1385969943

It is necessary for just one component in the chain to add latency (monitor refresh, uncompressing, a bad cable modem, a bad router in the path, overloaded server, bloated JS code in the page). It is very hard to remove (one can argue impossible, but I am thinking of a multi-path set up with redundant hardware or network connections)<p>* Even though we can process teraflops per second on home GPU cards, our websites load about as a fast as they did 10 years ago.<p>* Border-line imperceptible UI or audio latencies still lead to bad user experience. They might not even know why they don&#x27;t like it but in an A/B test they would pick the faster more response one. This was the case with Android vs Apple up until not too long ago. Even tiny UI jerkiness is enough to annoy a large number of users.<p>* OS and whole software stacks are usually designed for improved throughput not low latency processing. It takes tuning (proc and sys params) or even installing a special kernel to get better latency support for low level code.<p>* More benchmarks also measure throughput more than latency. Software is often picked and compared based on throughput, latency is second citizen most often. In a sequential setup for example, the two are compliments of each other, the more requests per second, the lower the latency of each request. It is only in concurrent and parallel contexts when latency starts to behave widely different. Send 100 requests at the same time towards the server? What happens? Do 50 get processed in 1ms but the rest block for 25ms?<p>* Low latency and liveliness has to be baked into the innards of the system/VM/framework.

6832235,comment,6831461,6831461,3,0,robomartin,,,"I agree with the general sentiment.  I day-traded for about a year and came out of it concluding that long term stock &quot;investing&quot; is bonkers.  Long term in this context means holding a position past market close.  I put &quot;investing&quot; between quotes because I came out of the experience thinking that holding stocks past a day&#x27;s closing bell was nothing short than gambling.  Some of the things I saw happening after market close were just scary.  The minute people stopped recoiling at insane P/E ratios it went from investing to legalized gambling.<p>I did very well day trading but it required massive amounts of work.  I devoted no less than four hours pre-market-open and another four post-close to research and data analysis.  Taking risks was part and parcel of every single trade.  Perhaps the toughest things to get used to was to sell everything --and I do mean everything-- before market close in order to avoid having any open positions overnight.  It was tough because there were days when you&#x27;d close out at a loss.  On any give day you could be up several thousand or down just as much.<p>The reason I concluded intraday trading to be a better idea (assuming you have the time) was that the charts and a number of other data points almost give you all the information you need to trade.  You trade a narrow set of stocks that you get to know very well.  Each has it&#x27;s own personality from day to day.  You get used to this personality.  You look for stocks that don&#x27;t have crazy volatility or, at the other end of the spectrum, don&#x27;t put you to sleep waiting for things to happen.  With the right amount of action and the enough experience to avoid emotional trading you can pull back, watch the sheep go up and down the charts and play against them.  If you are smart, have patience, luck and don&#x27;t get greedy, you can make money.<p>Why did I stop?  Because the time and effort invested never results in a profit center that you can decouple from.  In that sense it isn&#x27;t any different than being a brick layer:  If you stop laying bricks you stop earning money.  I was laying bricks sixteen hours a day.<p>It&#x27;s that simple.  Instead, if you invest a solid sixteen hours per day, Monday through Friday on a business or a career I firmly believe that, in the long run, you&#x27;ll be far better off.<p>There are cases where the stock market is a neat place to make lots of money.  You don&#x27;t have to be in the market to take advantage of those.  You simply have to be ready, willing and able to do so when the opportunity presents itself.  All you are looking for are market crashes.  It&#x27;s that simple.  They&#x27;ve happened before and they&#x27;ll happen again.  And, if you are looking for long term passive gains, that&#x27;s the best time to jump in.  Don&#x27;t bet the farm on it, but be ready and act decisively when it happens.

The difference is that it&#x27;s not a human vs human driver problem but a schedule design and human making bad scheduling decisions now that the trains are running late, implementation problem.<p>Furthermore, train drivers are cheap (compared with other infrastructure investments) and relatively efficient as they can be skilfully  taught to drive according to a plan (compared with your fellow road commuters). Without other investments to tell the driver or the computer that they can drive faster/closer to the train in front at most railways are only likely to see efficiency gains (lower power/diesel usage) but struggle to drive those trains to denser schedules.

When the pie stops growing (or even slows markedly) that relief valve is no longer available.  Worse, the dynamics of various systems and institutions, <i>including liberal democratic ones</i> (but also &quot;free market&quot; systems) appear to behave pathologically under resource constraint circumstances (not that non-democratic ones behave better in all cases).  It&#x27;s a rather sticky problem (and for the record:  I happen to like many of the features of democratic and liberal institutions).",1385967826

And soon enough it&#x27;s just a part of life and you can&#x27;t believe society ever got along without it. There is a massive danger that overly conservative regulations will impede technological progress and innovation.<p>And to be perfectly honest I&#x27;m not worried about privacy from it. There isn&#x27;t much you can see from a drone you can&#x27;t with binoculars and possibly a ladder. And besides that, no one is going to spy on you. It&#x27;s going to be something minor that happens to one out of a million people and then gets completely exaggerated by the media.<p>Whereas changing the world&#x27;s distribution system has massive implications on everyone&#x27;s lives, and many of the other possible uses of drones can change the world as well.

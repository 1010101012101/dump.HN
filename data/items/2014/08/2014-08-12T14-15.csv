There&#x27;s nondeterminism in our subjective experience, but it&#x27;s a surface phenomenon rather than something fundamental.<p>So I guess we&#x27;ve sidestepped the question the &quot;theorem&quot; is aimed at, because by adopting this viewpoint we&#x27;re already assuming that humans don&#x27;t have any kind of physical nondeterminism (or &quot;free will&quot;, if you insist).<p>Personally I think the idea was stupid as stated; having a set of dice inside your head doesn&#x27;t make you any more likely to have &quot;free will&quot; than if you didn&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s all that quantum nondeterminism really means. But I guess some philosophers really did claim that this was support for the notion of free will, so it&#x27;s worth refuting that as directly as possible.<p>So I guess you&#x27;re right: if anything, a many-worlds interpretation gives more support to the idea that quantum nondeterminism has something to do with free will, because it means the nondeterminism only comes in when we look at a human&#x27;s subjective observations.

The drivers tell me that either company will give you $$$ to switch and that drivers are coveted.  Every feature that one gets, the other will imitate.<p>As a consumer it seems that there is basically no difference between the two services, I take whichever has less surge at the moment and/or whichever my friends want to take.

I feel like VCs will just keep pumping money into them and fueling the price war.  It seems to me that instead one should focus on really differentiating the service in some way to reverse the commoditization of private, on-demand rides.  They either need to make their service preferable in some way to consumers (like Dropbox has done for file sharing) or make it a no-brainer choice for drivers to exclusively drive with them.<p>Not that I&#x27;m complaining, this war basically just serves to make private transportation cheaper for consumers like me.",1407855122

In  New York, the law takes away the right of workers to sue for workplace injuries in most circumstances. In return, employers pay for workers compensation insurance, and claims are paid out on a &quot;no fault&quot; basis. The purpose of this compromise is to reduce the cost of litigating fault for workers compensation claims. Sure, it&#x27;s unlikely that your office worker employees will hurt themselves in the course of their jobs, but it&#x27;s not impossible, and that minimal risk is reflected in the low cost of insurance for office workers.<p>Editorializing: It is notable, though, that while these sorts of compromises tend to favor larger businesses for whom the administrative overhead is relatively insignificant.

A full set of break pad for a 2010 Ford Escape (Random vehicle, yours may vary) cost 100 dollars at Autozone- these are the expensive ones that appear to have a lifetime warranty- cheaper ones are half that much.  I checked, and the lifetime warranty on the expensive ones does appear to cover commercial use (the warranty on the cheap ones explicitly does not, but the expensive ones do not exclude commercial use.)<p>I don&#x27;t know how often your breaks wear out, but lets say you put the expensive ones on every month- and that you don&#x27;t get free pads because of the warranty (Thought it appears that you should).  A break job should only take an hour or two once you have done it a few times.  Pretty simple stuff.  Change the oil while your at it- another $20.  (EDIT:  I just realized that some new vehicles use more expensive synthetic oil- so you may have to double or triple this number, but you also may not have to change your oil as often, so it may work out about the same)   $120 plus 2 hours of your time each month.   120/4 = 30.<p>1170 - 30 = 1140.<p>Your going to need new tires.  Lets say you replace them every other month.  Walmart lists them at around $100 a piece for a 60,000 mile tire.  Your probably not going to get that many miles, but it should be at least 40,000.  Again, I don&#x27;t know how much driving your doing, so lets say you replace them every 3 months.  It would probably be in your interest to do it yourself if doing it that often.  But lets say you pay someone to do it so you don&#x27;t have to buy and store the tools and deal with it.  $20 per tire- (20 + 100) x 4 = 480, lets just say $500 every 3 months.<p>500/3/4 = $42.  1170-42= 1128.<p>Now, there will be other misc maintenance and repairs.  Lets say $100 per week- I think that is high.  Your vehicle isn&#x27;t that old and you are keeping it well maintained, staying up on the simple things before they become major.  We have already figured depreciation, so your replacing the vehicle when it is worn out.<p>1128-100 = $1028 per week after all expenses are accounted for.<p>1128/40 = $28 per hour.  But you will have to pay self employment taxes.  That will cost you a few extra bucks an hour.  But you are still making significantly more than 15/hour.<p>Unless I am missing something.  Please feel free to contribute your own numbers to my napkin math.",1407854712

It&#x27;s worth noting that you should call your agent to see whether their required forms are just them offering to fill out a form you could file yourself with state governments, often at an added fee just to fill out a few lines for you. In my experience, they&#x27;ll give a straight answer if you ask.<p>Also, for any companies doing business in New Jersey, there&#x27;s a $500 minimum income tax even if you make no revenue - and even if you put the business on hold but still keep some assets on the corporation&#x27;s books at any time that year - so be aware of that. It&#x27;s somewhat ironic that for companies operating at a loss, states often refuse to waive any minimum tax - would they not wish the companies to be able to put that money towards their success, and to have a higher probability of generating both jobs and much higher income taxes in their states in future years?

Something like it (the connection may not be an ESB, <i>per se</i>) is pretty much an essential stepping stone in a conversion effort (and enterprises are notorious for taking the first enabling step and then not following through with that that step is intended to enable.)<p>If microservices become a popular focus of attention, don&#x27;t be surprised to see the term drift the way SOA did for the same reasons, and see us back here in a couple decades with a new term and discussing how it (doesn&#x27;t) differ from &quot;microservices&quot;.

Well, obviously that was not the problem (or at least not 100% the problem, part of science is knowing how certain to be about things) Maybe next you can define the problem as: the site is buggy, issues aren&#x27;t resolved quickly. If I observe my employees I can see that they spend a lot of time staring at the 98inch projector screen I set up in my &#x27;cool office&#x27; instead of coding. Now you can do a trial run of turning off the projector on some days vs others and seeing if the work goes up, stays the same, or goes down. Or you can discuss the problem with your employees and see if they have input. Then define the experiment using that; just don&#x27;t forget to actually measure something objective at the end of the day.<p>This way of thinking is invaluable. You can drill down exactly to the problem core. Waste less resources. Argue less. Most importantly you can actually sit down at the end of the day and prove that you have solved a problem with actual data that cannot be easily disputed, and if you&#x27;ve really done it right the experiment can be repeated and have the same result each time.",1407852350

You don&#x27;t really have to ack every packet, you have to order them, drop duplicates and ack the last one.<p>2. Google ignores the TCP flow control algorithm and sends the first few hundred packets very quickly without waiting for acks. They do this to beat the latency of the flow control algorithm. That&#x27;s why you end up with so many packets on your side. You could just try anything but google, and you would probably see that you have a less insane packet storm.",1407852312

8167749,comment,8166701,8167709,3,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;ve done some analysis on my own of that. There are more, but those 3 tend to dominate the culture of an organization.<p>Organizations want 3 things from people: subordinacy, dedication, and strategy (working on the right things). You&#x27;ll almost never see all 3, because a person who is strategic will either optimize for minimum discomfort (and not be dedicated/sacrificial) or for maximum personal yield (and, while he might follow orders, won&#x27;t put the organization&#x27;s goals above his own).<p>Moreover, people who have zero or one of those 3 traits are generally maladaptive and fall into a &quot;Lumpenloser&quot; category that excludes them even from the Loser in-group, and they&#x27;ll usually be quickly let go.<p>This means that the interesting people will have 2 of those 3 traits. If they&#x27;re subordinate and strategic (but not dedicated) they become minimum-effort Losers. If they&#x27;re subordinate and dedicated (but not strategic) they become the middle-manager Clueless who clean up the messes made below and above them. If they&#x27;re strategic and dedicated (but not subordinate) they fall into the category called &quot;Sociopath&quot;.<p>The labels are a bit unfair. Most of the &quot;Losers&quot; aren&#x27;t dislikable or inept people, and often the &quot;cool kids&quot; are MacLeod Losers. (In startups, the cool kids are Clueless.) Likewise, most of the &quot;Sociopaths&quot; aren&#x27;t bad people-- just ambitious and not willing to sacrifice their own goals for the benefit of an organization that wouldn&#x27;t return the favor.",1407852171

It was an extremely enlightening exercise. I recommend you go deeper instead of just using a premade Python library for TCP!",1407852054

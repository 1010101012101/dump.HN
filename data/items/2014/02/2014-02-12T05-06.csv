I also eat more fatty meats than average but that goes along with doing heavy weight training at least 3 times a week.<p>There are many foods that looked at out of context aren&#x27;t particularly &quot;healthy&quot; if considered against an average modern sedentary lifestyle but which are sources of either quick energy or useful protein which can be beneficial for weight management and overall health if properly utilized.<p>All of this is why talking about diet without also talking about exercise is useless.<p>My completely non-scientific belief is that while over-consumption of sugar isn&#x27;t a great thing, the primary thing making us fat is that we&#x27;ve switched to a massively sedentary lifestyle on average.  We aren&#x27;t toiling in the factory or on the farm or walking door to door selling vacuums, and mostly that&#x27;s a good thing because those jobs aren&#x27;t particularly interesting for many of us, but at the same time our bodies aren&#x27;t really evolved for sitting down 8-16 hours a day.",1392184728

7222771,comment,7219872,7222318,2,0,dclara,,,"Losing weight is not that simple. A short term effect can be made easily. But after a while, your bad habit will drive you back and even your body will feel better to stay at a certain weight, refuse to reduce more. The worse case is it usually bounces back. So short term weight loss does not count.<p>This is a problem that so many people are fighting against, and mostly we are losing. Exercise may help, eat less may help, they are not ultimate solutions. The fundamental thing or the root cause is that our metabolism becomes slow which tends to accumulate more fat, and the energy being absorbed from food is not enough per meal, so we tend to eat more. Increasing the quality of food without junk, all organic and fresh, no transgenes, no trans-fat, is the ultimate solution along with regular exercise. But we may not be able to afford or be willing to pay the cost for staying healthy. It has a long term impact.",1392184580

7222760,comment,7219872,7220889,2,0,graycat,,,"In high school, a relatively good high\nschool (public, but my year MIT came\nrecruiting, and the year before three\nguys went to Princeton and ran against\neach other against some fourth SOB for\nPresident of the freshman class), I took\nfour years of math.  Since my brother was\nin a private college, to save money I\ndid my freshman year at a not very good\nstate college.  There they wouldn&#x27;t let\nme take calculus and, instead, forced me\ninto some &#x27;college algebra&#x27; -- from my\nfour years in high school I already knew\n99% of it.  So, a girl told me when the\ntests were, and I showed up only for those.\nTeacher said I was &quot;The best math student\nI&#x27;ve ever had.&quot;.  Well, maybe, but the\nmain reason was I&#x27;d long since learned\nthe material.<p>So, for calculus, I just got a good book\nand dug in.  So, yes, first I did the\nchapters on analytic geometry, i.e.,\nthe conic sections -- hyperbolas, \nparabolas, ellipses -- and then one with\ncalculus.  For my next year, my brother\nwas out of the good, private college,\nso I transferred in as a sophomore\nand hopeful math major.  So, I started\nwith their sophomore calculus.  Did fine.\nWrote my honors paper in math and got\n800 on my GRE Math knowledge test.<p>But, right, I &#x27;skipped&#x27; freshman calculus,\nnever took it!  Didn&#x27;t get credit for\nit, either.<p>In grad school, there was an advanced course\nin linear algebra.  I&#x27;d never had a course\nin linear algebra but still told the faculty\nthat I didn&#x27;t need that course.  They said,\nwith a patronizing smile, &quot;Take it anyway.&quot;.<p>Okay.  I blew away all the other students\nwith by wide margins the highest scores on\nhomework, tests, and midterm and final exams.\nProf wrote, &quot;Best performance in the class.\nKnows this material cold.&quot;.  Yup.  I told\nthem so!  Heck, I&#x27;d wanted to study optimal\ncontrol theory, not waste time with linear\nalgebra.  How&#x27;d I do that?  That is, essentially\n&#x27;skip&#x27; a first, and, really, an advanced,\nsecond course in linear algebra?  Easy?  I\nalready knew the material from independent\nstudy of a stack of books, including some\nof the best, especially Halmos, &#x27;Finite\nDimensional Vector Spaces&#x27;.  But in total\nit was a big stack.  How?  Why?  A long\nlist of various projects in school and in\nmy career in physics, signal processing,\napplied math, numerical analysis, multivariate\nstatistics, and more along with some careful\nindependent study.<p>Lesson:  Independent study can work fine.\nThen can &#x27;skip&#x27; about whatever you want,\nat least in math.<p>Really, guys, what the heck do you think\na research prof or any researcher does?\nActually know all that stuff just from\nsitting in classes in school?  Heck no!\nInstead they learn, from texts, papers,\nseminars, etc.  Actually, if need to\nknow something and can get a good text,\nthen usually can get good understanding\nof just what need from that text for\nless than 10% of the effort that would\nbe required if had to learn the text\nwell enough to get an A on all of it.\nNet, independent study is crucial.",1392184375

It&#x27;s starting to become an example of &quot;rule by victimhood&quot; (c.f. &quot;rule by decree&quot;). Whole terminology has been devised by feminist and other similar movements so as to make the oppression narrative appear untouchably true. For example, the word &quot;sexism&quot; (as well as a few other similar &quot;-isms&quot;) has been defined as something one-directional, something that only men can afflict on women and not the other way around. This is considered to be valid because there supposedly exists an &quot;institutionalized oppression&quot; that makes sexism possible, and that therefore sexism in the opposite direction is impossible. In other words, the very definition of a word contains an <i>a priori</i> assumption, with the net effect being that repetitive use of aforementioned word in ideologically correct context engenders constantly consuming this assumption at face value.<p>I could go on for hundreds of pages, but I will stop here.",1392184202

I doubt about that because from what you&#x27;ve said in the previous posts, you feel lonely, or socially lonely, because not many common topics can be shared between you and the normal people. Or you feel it&#x27;s so hard to make the advanced research in your area to benefit normal people.<p>I guess there is a gap in your heart which needs to be bridged with your social life. Advanced research can be seen as a type of work, all the scientists are kind of isolated with the regular groups of people. But they can still have their social life to enjoy food, art and something else outside the work.<p>On the other hand, my doubt came from the fact that you have a wife who is more intelligent than you. If you did, you would never feel lonely. No matter what you do in this world, you have companion who can really understand your value is. You should not feel lonely and you would not feel it so weird when you see the majority of people cannot understand you. If you wish to get rid of the social isolation, there are always ways to enjoy other types of pleasure life brings to you.

7222739,comment,7215870,7219375,1,0,fredophile,,,"Why do you say CS takes one of the easiest fields in mathematics? People have been studying CS since long before we had computers and there are still famous open problems. If the math is so easy perhaps you&#x27;d like to give a proof for P=NP (or P!=NP) and claim your million dollars? Do you really think CS is all discrete math and graph theory? I don&#x27;t go around claiming physics is easy because Newtonian mechanics are simple. I&#x27;d also argue that math only gets interesting once you take the numbers away. If all you&#x27;re doing is number crunching you should probably just write some code instead. Computers are good at that sort of thing.<p>In my experience the real disconnect with CS degrees is expectations about what is and what should be taught. A lot of students want a vocational program. Universities end up teaching a hodgepodge of topics such as how to write code in a particular language, program design/software engineering, algorithms and complexity, discipline specific specialties (e.g. AI, OSes), computability, etc.<p>When I was in university I was taught how to debug my code with ddd and gdb. Was this a waste of my time because I no longer use them? Of course not. Everything I learned with them carries over to the debuggers I use everyday. My degree also covered several languages that I&#x27;ve never used outside of classes. The skills I learned learning them help me any time I want to pick up a new language and start coding.<p>Code is not a primary tool for expressing algorithms and concepts. Code is how I tell the computer what to do. If code was so good for communicating concepts and algorithms to other people I wouldn&#x27;t need to write comments. I also haven&#x27;t seen any algorithm books that include real code. The closest you&#x27;ll get there is MIX. Good luck programming a real application in that.",1392183934

Because before his teachers, back\nto his age 7 or so, had carefully walked\nhim through the music note by note and \nbar by bar and, likely then, the artistic\nexpression.  But, still he was darned\ngifted.  So, a few years later, relearning\nviolin, he was fine again for the rest of his\nlife.<p>Being able to do arithmetic, algebra, and other\nmathematical operations in your head is fine.\nE.g., during WWII, John von Neumann, one of the\nbest mathematicians of the 20th or any century,\nsometimes went to people working on war projects\nto see if he could help them out.  At one stop,\na guy was unsure about how to find a solution,\nso von Neumann suggested, &quot;Let&#x27;s try a local\nsolution via infinite series and look at a few\nterms.  So, von Neumann did the arithmetic in\nhis head [he could take two eight digit numbers\nand multiply them together in his head].  When\nvon Neumann left, the guy was near tears.  Why?\nBecause he had been up all night using a mechanical\ndesk calculator to get just some of that arithmetic\nright!<p>I found in doing research in math (I&#x27;ve published\nsuch stuff), once get into the problem well then\ndo most of the thinking for the actual research\njust between the ears and writing very little.\nCan even do some of the algebraic derivations\njust between the ears.  The actual research, at\nleast the way I do it, is heavily &#x27;conceptual&#x27;\nwhere writing isn&#x27;t very efficient anyway.<p>From what you wrote, I see nothing wrong with your\nabilities.  If you are not handy with paper and\npencil, then it is not too much to expect you to\nbecome handy with just some usage.  So, try, and\nsoon you will &#x27;get it&#x27;.  It sounds like your\nproblem with calculus was mostly just a problem\nwith paper and pencil -- so, &#x27;get it&#x27; with paper\nand pencil.  Unless are, say, another von Neumann,\ncan&#x27;t expect to do significant derivations in\ncalculus, say, integration by parts or multiple\nintegrals, without writing down the expressions\nstep by step.<p>But, of course, for calculus, long ago some software\nefforts for integration worked out what expressions\ncould be integrated in closed form and what ones\ncould not and wrote software to do the integrations\nfor all the ones that could.  The results are in\nat least one of the old computer algebra packages!\nSo, with that software, &quot;Look, Ma, no pencil or\npaper!&quot;.<p>About your suspected faults, don&#x27;t be the least\ndiscouraged about them!  Some are just your\nimagination.  Some can be easily enough corrected.\nEssentially all the rest can be circumvented.<p>In particular, it appears that you are concerned\nabout some skills that were supposed to take\nyou from a few days to at most a few months\nto get good enough with way back long before\nyou shaved!  Doing catch up on that material\nnow should be a few days&#x27; walk in the park.\nE.g., in K-12, I didn&#x27;t learn English grammar\nand punctuation very well.  In college \nI was in math and physics where this gap was\nnot very important, and otherwise I just \nwrote only sentences where I did understand\nthe grammar and punctuation.  Now I&#x27;ve long\nhad a 12th grade English grammar book right\nat hand and look up details when I&#x27;m in \ndoubt; long ago I got nearly everything I\nmissed in K-12.<p>Back to working without writing, in plane geometry\nI refused to do the homework the way the teacher\nwanted, write out in full detail proofs of just\nthree problems.  Instead I worked all the non-trivial\nproblems and then also the more challenging ones\nin the back of the book, often writing nothing,\nsometimes writing in the margin of the book, \nsometimes on scraps of paper, and only for a few\nof the most difficult problems in the book, actually\nwriting out a complete proof.  Worked fine!  When\nthe teacher wanted to see my homework, I showed\nher nothing, and she was torqued.  When I came in\nsecond in the class on the state test, she was\n&#x27;confused&#x27; since she thought that I didn&#x27;t do any\nof the homework!  Heck, I solved every non trivial\nproblem in the book and, thus, likely did the \nmost homework of anyone in the class.  Also, I\nslept in class -- I learned from the book in\na quiet room, not when she was making noise\nin front of the class!  Being able to learn\nmath just from a book proved crucial, the main\nway I got my Ph.D.!<p>Lesson:  You don&#x27;t always have to do it their way!",1392183317

So, you get an intern and have him/her gather the URLs to every PDF available in California. Then Oregon. Then Washington and so on.

Sorry, no, some of these things should <i>not</i> be tied together. Without that tying, we already have (known, tested) tools that cover most of these features.<p>Yes, I understand that <i>some</i> people have needs that require more (or different) features in their init process.

Requirements and uses for general purpose computers vary a lot, though - especially in an environment like UNIX that encourages customization. My needs, for example, were <i>mostly</i> met by OpenRC&#x27;s reworking of sysvinit. Some minor customization solved that problem completely.

Acting like a monopoly and tying other projects together to force upgrade because of vertical integration is yet another part that makes me question motive in addition to the technical issues.<p>You want us to support systemd? Disconnect it from other stuff like the INIT (pid=0), the logger, and IPC (dbus). Allow all those to remain as they were previously. Let systemd be just the process launcher/manager, and allow let all of those parts work stand-alone with existing tools. Note: providing <i>more</i> features when your tools are used together is fine (and expected). This way, the software can stand on it sown, and if it really is big of an improvement as the systemd supports suggest, the migration will happen naturally over time.<p>If, on the other hand, using one tool continues to have the requirement of trading many other system-level tools that I already know and use, for <i>unproven</i> newcomers that seem to ignore the lessons of the past, well...

If you want to reverse a transaction involving actual cast, you must convince the other person to give it back, or physically wrest possession of the currency from them.<p>Reversibility shows up when you do transactions in a bank or other third party that can reverse the transaction on its own accord. There&#x27;s no theoretical reason why this can&#x27;t happen with bitcoin instead - you give your BTC to a hypothetical, highly regulated bank or broker or whatever, and then the transaction is exactly as reversible as any electronic transaction using dollars. The confusion sets in when you compare Bitcoin transactions with electronic transactions using fiat currency, when they&#x27;re closer in many ways to physical cash transactions in nature.",1392182549

Having to create, maintain and monitor your own infrastructure is a very big time cost which has very real consequences when you are in a business. As a business you should be spending as much time as possible focusing on your product and not things that are extraneous to it. At this point the basic infrastructure for 99 % of small web applications is pretty much identical: a web service, a backend relational store, a load balancer, and probably a caching service. This basic set-up can accommodate a wide range of features. There is absolutely no need to spend time configuring these services and making sure they remain up and running. I see a lot of people who want to configure their own infrastructure because for some reason they believe their application is special. Invariably, if you look at their application more closely I&#x27;ve realized that, no, it tends not to be that special. Perhaps when/if they scale up the service requirements they will need to be become more specialized but even then, probably not. Even if it does end up that you have to change your application&#x27;s structure during scaling,  trying to make it ready for scaling too early is a premature optimization and will end up costing you.",1392181516

When the founder is looking for a job 2 years later, if it&#x27;s via acquihire, it is <i>probably</i> a wash on cash (due to taxes...potentially quite ahead); has almost certainly had more public visibility and thus potentially is in a &quot;bidding&quot; situation for his talent, etc.  I doubt the 90th percentile Stanford CS grad gets more than $150k cash, $250k total compensation, in year 1, and probably not more than 200k/300k in year 2, at a tech company.<p>A person at the 90th percentile, all things being equal, probably isn&#x27;t good enough to get one of the $250-500k hedge fund programming jobs.<p>Taking the good dev job/employee #1 at the hot startup which happens to do well is better than being founder of the failed startup.<p>Obviously, the person who starts Facebook is ahead of everyone.<p>Partially it&#x27;s that equity compensation (in an acquihire/earn out) is tax privileged, part is that it&#x27;s essentially forced savings.  From $100k to $200k, you lose a lot of your income to basically bullshit -- US/CA taxes and somewhat higher living standard, higher student loan repayment, etc. -- where if you can essentially bet that &quot;pre-tax&quot; on a startup, you probably come out ahead.<p>I&#x27;m not sure how this applies to someone in the bottom 90% of Stanford, or in the bottom 99% of the world.  Probably the best bet is to somehow get into a top startup in a role where performance isn&#x27;t so critical to the ultimate success of the company, usually after Series B, or at a big company.<p>Someone who is <i>the</i> top CS grad for the year, or who is later in career with exceptional talent, or who has a burning drive for a specific area (e.g. Steve Mann in wearables), has an entirely different analysis, too.

7222600,comment,7222299,7222552,59,0,ef4,,,"> Again, it all comes back to calories in vs calories out.<p>Which is both true and irrelevant, because the system that governs calories in and calories out is a complex control loop. When it&#x27;s working correctly, weight is effortlessly maintained within a narrow range thanks to compensating adjustments in appetite and, to a lesser extent, metabolism.<p>When it isn&#x27;t working right, people try to drive the process with their frontal cortex instead, which only a small fraction of population can actually achieve for any significant length of time.<p>So the most interesting questions in nutrition science are all around what effects satiety and why we have an epidemic of people with broken control loops. Sugar is a very strong suspect in that investigation.<p>And before someone says we aren&#x27;t evolved for an environment of plenty, and our bodies just hoard every calorie they can get in case of famine -- that&#x27;s really not it. No mammal simply hoards every calorie it can get without homeostatic feedback. Survival incentivizes <i>balance</i> -- hoarding a calorie means you don&#x27;t spend that calorie today on something else that would aid your reproductive success. Which is why we (and most animals) have an extremely dynamic system to monitor and maintain appropriate energy stores.",1392181293

Javascript is in every browser and the console is a wonderful place to start. When I teach ruby (on Mac&#x27;s) I have to start with, &quot;well ok, now download xcode&quot;.

If it is than wage gaps are no issue, but economic liberty is overrated.  The industrial economy, even though it produces significant social inequality on a substantial level, is very good at hiding it behind formal equality.<p>But to get to a substantive analysis, one has to look at what people&#x27;s options in life are.  If women can&#x27;t seek divorce but can murder their husbands with impunity provided that certain cultural fictions remain intact (the case in ancient Athens, see Chris Faraone&#x27;s &quot;Ancient Greek Love Magic&quot; covering poisonous love potions as a defence against murder, and note too that a purpose of the potions was to abate anger), then the right to divorce is totally subsumed in more substantial, even extreme, options.<p>If one accepts substantial realities as the measure of equality, then women are <i>less</i> equal today politically and economically than they were in 1800.",1392181230

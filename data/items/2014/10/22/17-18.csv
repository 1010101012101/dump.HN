I think, for a bunch of reasons which are more and less easy to mitigate depending, it&#x27;s a good rule of thumb to just avoid key-dependent side channels altogether. If you know what you&#x27;re doing, you can shrink the risks. I&#x27;m dubious about whether they can be eliminated.<p>But even if one is  the kind of person who can argue eloquently and accurately about those risks on a mailing list (nb: not alluding to you here), one is unlikely in my experience to be the kind of person who can actually implement countermeasures to these problems reliably. I&#x27;ve reviewed lots of expertly developed cryptosystems and found exploitable problems. My experience suggests that even good implementors do not tend to design systems from the vantage point of attackers, which squares with my experience of every other kind of software security as well.<p>A caveat to all of this is that it&#x27;s easy for me to opine about what I think good conservative rules of thumb are because my technical depth doesn&#x27;t extend to safely implementing variably-timed crypto operations. A subject matter expert might be able to refute a lot of what I think.<p>Because this is a fluffy comment, a quick shotgun blast of technical responses, none of which beg for rebuttals (but feel free):<p>* I can think of cases where randomized delays on one code path failed to eliminate timing leaks on other code paths that turned out to be relevant to attackers.<p>* I&#x27;m skeptical about exploitation of microscopic timing leaks; I don&#x27;t even worry about memcmp timing, really. Other people are less skeptical, and there&#x27;s a line of research pursuing statistical filtering and heuristics to bring those timing channels into reach. Also, there are some secrets that are attackable essentially indefinitely.<p>* My thoughts about worst-case timing are probably poisoned by client reactions to the idea of slowing down crypto operations at all.",1413999898

8493827,comment,8489623,8492957,0,0,logfromblammo,,,"There is a simple fix: the government cannot possess any weapon that it denies to individuals.<p>If you cannot own a fully-automatic firearm, the Army cannot own any.  If you cannot own an air-to-air missile, the Air Force cannot own any.  If you cannot own a nuclear missile sub, the Navy can&#x27;t have any.<p>This would eliminate outright bans, although regulatory restrictions that tend to favor people supported by military infrastructure would likely replace them.  Perhaps you would be permitted to own and use fully-automatic rifles, but you would also be required to regularly train, register, and qualify in their use, such that it would be a surmountable and nondiscriminatory barrier to ownership, albeit one more easily passed by military employees in the regular course of their duties.<p>There is no particular barrier currently imposed by the second amendment with respect to requiring that those who do keep and bear arms be proficient in their use.  It may even be supported by the &quot;well-regulated militia&quot; clause.  You may bear arms, but if you do, you must also be able to use them proficiently.<p>As I interpret it, the 2nd amendment allows me to own and carry any weapon of military significance, without regard to the threat it may pose to myself and my neighbors, from a simple, throwable rock to my own multi-warhead ICBM with tunable, independently-targeted payloads.  It is incredibly obvious that latter possibility is not very compatible with modern civilization.<p>If anyone is going to have private weapons of mass destruction, I would certainly want some limitation on their use, like the &quot;odd man&quot; failsafe-override procedure in Andromeda Strain, where those people with ultimate control over that weapon can satisfy some simple, objective criteria that ensure its use is rational, ethical, and viewpoint-agnostic.  This should allow an equal possibility for using something in an armed rebellion, or for the government to use it to suppress one.<p>The government nuclear infrastructure already has safeguards against improper use of arms.  Psychological screening, inventory controls, and authorization procedures, to name a few.  If private individuals or organizations were required to implement substantially similar safeguards, no one would bother owning any, because the weapons are simply too expensive to maintain, for something that you are never likely to be able to use and still remain the good guy.<p>If you think of the government as just a lot of regular people doing their jobs, allowing regular people to have military-grade weapons as an expensive hobby is no more threatening.  A Wyoming ranch owner with a nuclear missile is not more threatening than a Wyoming silo-bunker lieutenant with a nuclear missile, if they both have to get approval from someone presumed rational before they blow anything up.  The latter has his military chain of command.  Perhaps the former has to call up the county sheriff for his launch codes.  Donning the uniform does not somehow make a person more qualified to handle a weapon.  So if something is too dangerous for an individual, it is certainly too dangerous for an individual with a specific employer with an organizational structure geared around dilution of individual responsibility.",1413999011

I practice inbox 0- if an email is in my inbox, it means something needs to be done about it (whether it&#x27;s replying, filing a bug report, writing a patch, etc). Once it&#x27;s done, it gets archived. I star the stuff that I&#x27;ll need to refer to later, like tickets for a flight or concert. I then have a few server side rules to do things like mark certain classes of emails as read (eg build logs, mailing lists), so as to not flood my phone with notifications. And... that&#x27;s it.<p>(edit: oh and yes, I am also very diligent about unsubscribing from the stuff I know will never be relevant, rather than just archiving it and forgetting about it until another email from the same source comes up a week later. After a few weeks of consistently practicing this, your inbox gets much better)<p>I get probably a few hundred emails a day at most (work+personal), and this system works great for me. I know people like Paul Graham think email is utterly broken, but when you&#x27;re at their level I&#x27;m not sure ~any~ tool will be satisfying - they&#x27;re absolutely outliers.<p>So HNers, do you really have a problem with your email workflow, or is everyone just repeating &quot;email is broken&quot; because some smart people with an ungodly amount of email said so?",1413997835

This was back in 2002-4.<p>I wrote the entire site from scratch for him in ASP 1.1 with VB script. ASP.net wasn&#x27;t even around yet. The entire site ran on a DELL box in his office with Comcast Cable internet serving hundreds of charities and taking credit card transactions and ACH transfers online. This was all before any kind of PCI requirements. The only requirement from the bank was SSL.<p>The worst part of this job was that he was too cheap to have a separate dev and prod environment so all my dev and updating was done on a live site with live credit cards flying by. If I happened to hit save in the middle of a transaction, the whole processing flow might change mid swipe. I was a nervous wreck every day going home. My biggest point of pride is that out of the 2-3 years working with this client, I only lost 1 table of reference data in the DB. That was the biggest disaster I had.<p>The ironic part of all this was that even through he cared very little about the transactions he lost due to the prod site also being dev, he was absolutely fanatic about HTML layout and pixel perfect design. Since it was difficult to guarantee consistent cross browser look and feel back then, the just converted all text and layout to images...so each page was just an html table with images in each cell.<p>Oh...he also believed his firewall was slowing down his cable internet so he turned it off.

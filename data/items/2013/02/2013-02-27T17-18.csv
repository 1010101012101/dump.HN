5293772,comment,5287474,5290998,1,0,bpatrianakos,,,"Seriously? iOS doesn't have a terminal? What are you going to do with a terminal on an iPad? Run operations on the non-existent file system? The iPad is not meant for computing. It's an entertainment device. That statement is almost like saying ""TV manufacturers are forgetting about the power users! My new Sony flatscreen doesn't even come with a terminal so I could... uhh... adjust the picture, color, brightness, etc. from the command line instead of just using the real simple buttons on the side"".<p>The Mac App Store doesn't really have any relationship with the terminal. There's no reason to believe that its in Apple's interest in any way to take away the terminal. It's still Unix underneath, they still provide developer tools, and they still need developers to write applications for them. In addtion Macs are still huge in the design/developer community because they're well suited to graphic design work with their appearance, focus on large screens and high resolutions, and performance. They're pretty big in the developer community too as you get a great ""point and click"" kind of OS with full and easy access to the terminal and most of the goodies you get with a full-fledged Linux machine.<p>Finally, your argument is that Apple is ignoring power users but you use an example where it's actually your carrier that's stopping you, not Apple. You said it yourself, the iPad <i>does</i> support tethering but your <i>carrier</i> is the one who enables/disables it. Seems more like your carrier is against power users, not Apple.<p>In the end, just because Apple makes the OS more ""point and click"" friendly and comes with a pretty opinionated set of defaults for non-power users doesn't mean they're trying to keep power users out. By definition, if you're a power user, these things they're doing should be a minor annoyance when you get a new Mac and after a couple of hours you should have your machine how you like it because... drumroll please... you're a power user and know how to do that stuff! I personally don't see much difference between OS X and some of the more ""user-friendly"" Linux distros. They've both got the same underlying tools and are working hard to make it so your grandma can pick it up and get emails of her grandchildren within an hour. What I think the real problem people have, which maybe they just don't see, is that they just don't like change in general. New versions of OS X come out and they hid an option somewhere and everyone goes nuts and says ""Who moved my cheese! This is the worst computer ever!""",1361987976

A rigid, bureaucratic process exists so that they can always document a lack of corruption.

5293759,comment,5285101,5285101,1,0,randy909,,,"I've heard that one of the problem areas is that you can't make a perfect, colorless filter - one where 20KHz is allowed through but 20.001 is not. A filter has to slope down at least somewhat gradually. The more steep you make the filter, the more it colors (distorts) the signal around the cutoff frequency. One of the purported benefits to a higher sampling rate is that you can make the high frequency filter with a more gradual slope which introduces less distortion.<p>I realize any differences in this area would be very slight if they exist at all. Anyone know more about that?<p>Edit: Apparently no one can dell a difference in listening tests with well made equipment. Theoretically if a device was built using an extremely cheap filter you'd be better off with the higher sampling rate, but I can't find any real examples.",1361987869

They would do it on Saturday except they don't work on weekends.<p>And if you're thinking, ""Well, if I were a news organization, I would investigate the hell out of anything released on a Friday and print the story on Saturday""...except, all your readers are enjoying their weekends, by SUnday they'll be hungover, and on Monday, your scoop will be somewhat stale news.<p>There's almost never a good reason to release on a weekend night. Even if it were the case that all HN-geek-savvy users and tech bloggers spend their Saturday night on HN, they still might not provide enough momentum to get the spotlight on Monday/Tuesday, when people are most interested in getting back onto their computers and perusing the news.<p>The only two reasons I can think why you would post to HN on a weekend night:<p>1. You're afraid of a stampede of traffic...that's fine...but you should soft-launch on the weekend ,make sure any obvious bugs are out, and then pitch it on Monday.<p>2. It's possible that HN submissions are so sparse that you'll have a higher chance of being on the front page than on a busy weekday...that's a valid thought, as 15 votes on a Saturday night will get you more exposure than 20 votes on a Tuesday.<p>It's a tricky balance...but I wouldn't, as standard practice, do big things you want media spotlight for on Saturday.",1361986568

It was an internally-developed app server built in & for an internally-developed language, with its own internally-developed persistence mechanism, and it was my first day working with it. I had several terminals open, and in one I'd logged on to production to check how the data was formatted, so I could get something comparable for my dev environment. Unfortunately I forgot to log off, and at some point I issued the `stop server` command, thinking I was doing it on dev. A few minutes later the project leader, one of the most senior engineers, came over and started yelling at me. Fortunately not much was lost (other than a few users' sessions--not a high-traffic site). But I was really appalled at my mistake and I certainly wondered if I was about to be fired. Since then I've taken steps to (1) keep myself off production as much as possible (2) make a production terminal visually distinct from a non-production one. As a sometime project leader myself now, I also make sure newcomers can easily obtain an adequate development environment, and I don't give out the production login to every junior dev. :-)",1361985040

I mean, rephrase it as ""Is there any one person who can write to both production and backup copies of critical data?""   but it means the same thing as what you said.<p>(and if the CTO, or whoever is in charge of backups screws up this question?  the 'perfect storm' means ""all your data is gone""  - dono about you, but my plan for that involves bankruptcy court, and a whole lot of personal shame.  Someone coming in and stealing all the hardware?  not nearly as big of a deal, as long as I've still got the data.  My own 'backup' house is not in order, well, for lots of reasons, mostly having to do with performance, so I live with this low-level fear every day.)<p>Seriously, think, for a moment.  There's at least one kid with root on production /and/ access to the backups, right?  At most small companies, that is all your 'root-level' sysadmins.<p>That's bad.  What if his (or her) account credentials get compromised?  (or what if they go rogue?   it happens.  Not often, and usually when it does it's ""But this is really best for the company""  It's pretty rare that a SysAdmin actively and directly attempts to destroy a company.)<p>(SysAdmins going fully rogue is pretty rare, but I think it's still a good thought experiment.  If there is no way for the user to destroy something when they are actively hostile, you /know/ they can't destroy it by accident.  It's the only way to be sure.)<p>The point of backups, primarily, is to cover your ass when someone screws up, primarily.   (RAID, on the other hand, is primarily to cover your ass when hardware fails)    -  RAID is not Backup and Backup is not RAID.  You need to keep this in mind when designing your backup, and when designing your RAID.<p>(Yes, backup is also nice when the hardware failure gets so bad that RAID can't save you; but you know what?  that's pretty goddamn rare, compared to 'someone fucked up.')<p>I mean, the worst case backup system would be a system that remotely writes all local data off site, without keeping snapshots or some way of reverting.  That's not a backup at all;  that's a RAID.<p>The best case backup is some sort of remote backup where you physically can't overwrite the goddamn thing for X days.   Traditionally, this is done with off-site tape.  I (or rather, your junior sysadmin monkey)  writes the backup to tape, then tests the tape, then gives the tape to the iron mountain truck to stick in a safe.  (if your company has money;  if not, the safe is under the owner's bed.)<p>I think that with modern snapshots, it would be interesting to create a 'cloud backup' service where you have a 'do not allow overwrite before date X'  parameter, and it wouldn't be that hard to implement, but I don't know of anyone that does it.   The hard part about doing it in house is that the person who managed the backup server couldn't have root on production and vis-a-vis, or you defeat the point, so this is one case where outsourcing is very likely to be better than anything you could do yourself.",1361984474

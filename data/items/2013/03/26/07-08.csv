I used to carry it all over the place.  Not everyone relies on pockets!<p>November 2000: I did a 4800 bps dialup call over an analog cell connection to get a map going in a pinch while parked in a rental car far from home.  The hardest part was figuring out where I was so as to have a meaningful ""start"" address for mapquest.  <i>That</i> involved getting lucky and finding a storefront with a number visible, then looking at a yellow pages site for all of the locations of that store in the town I was in to see which one matched.  That gave me a street name and now I had a starting address.<p>(Newark, DE, you are on my list of miserable places to navigate at night.)<p>Normal people would never do the 4800 bps PPP craziness with images disabled, but a $500 camera from CompUSA (remember them?) isn't that special.",1364284724

Fewer implementations may support that, of course, but that's not really the fault of JSON. The Jackson parser for Java, for example, has a complete streaming API.",1364284695

Is it because complex solutions are easier to prove to be correct? And how does the (more or less purely) functional approach there work out with the fact that they basically do I/O all the time, meaning (I guess) high frequency input of financial data, computing and then output from and to standardized existing interfaces?<p>Edit: What I mean by that is - everytime I read FP books, IO is basically what everybody tries to explain on the last few pages and is rather ashamed to do at all. That makes it hard to imagine how those languages come to use in real world scenarios, that's why I'm asking ;-)",1364284483

5441828,comment,5441456,5441456,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"What kind of language and library makes creating an XML document is difficult? I know it's fashionable to hate XML, but seriously, it's a perfectly fine format, especially for serializing simple documents. The closing tags add some overhead; big deal.<p>I'm not even sure why much of a format was needed at all for this scenario. According to the docs[1], cURL will get a plaintext string, which has to be sufficient for nearly every implementation needing CNAM data. I'm quite sure I created a similar CNAM API in 2006: HTTP GET, return 200 OK and a string, or an HTTP error. Other major vendors' APIs are not difficult to work with, either (although contracts, VPNs, etc. can be annoying).<p>One reason there are more complicated APIs is for performance. While HTTP is simple, pipelining leaves a lot to be desired, and there is a benefit to being able to just use UDP.<p>As far as the data returned: I'm not even sure what an application supposed to do with a relative URI for a number after querying for that number? Or the price, which is apparently fixed per account? I cannot fathom why something as complicated as YAML would be needed to deal with such a simple situation: I'd wager customers asking for that are trying to be trendy or something, especially as JSON is a subset of YAML.<p>Not to be too negative -- OpenCNAM looks like the kind of thing telephony needs: easy, online signup, straightforward pricing.<p>1: <a href=""https://www.opencnam.com/docs/v2/quickstart"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.opencnam.com/docs/v2/quickstart</a>",1364284290

I've heard that some banks require them, though.\nAs for Self-Destructing Cookies: it's a pretty drastic measure. Considering this, it's surprisingly compatible. Among the sites that I frequent, not a single one stopped working. Inter-domain transaction - e.g. a shop forwarding you to Paypal and back - used to be a problem, but the latest version has a heuristic for that. Still, I'm pretty sure that some people will experience fallout. You can work around that; SDC has numerous functions that can help in such cases (pause, undelete, whitelist for session).",1364284280
5441826,comment,5440909,5441709,3,0,drewcoo,,,"When I read resumes, and I don't mind personally sifting through hundreds a week, I look for a narrative. If there's a cover letter, that helps create the narrative. I want to see personal, professional growth on a resume. I wonder about time gaps and seeming to do the same job repeatedly but they're not deal-killers at the resume screen stage. I look for increased depth of knowledge and increased scope of influence. Both of those things make someone more senior, rather than having just repeated the same year x-many times.<p>If someone can sell me his/her story in the cover letter and resume, I follow up on that in a phone screen. I'm still looking for more proof of someone being ""passionate"" (overused term but often part of HR doctrine) and showing that they grow and grow and grow.<p>This has never made any sense to any recruiters I've worked with and has sometimes been a hard sell to others when I wasn't the hiring manager but I honestly don't know how else to screen for ""has a lot of potential but maybe doesn't know our stack yet"".<p>I'd love to hear how other people do this.

5441823,comment,5441456,5441712,0,0,nrinaudo,,,"I disagree. XML has a huge advantage over JSON: it can be streamed.<p>When working with JSON, you must load the whole JSON document before you can start processing it. If the JSON gets big enough, you start having performance / memory issues. One might argue that you can just get more powerful hardware, but that's only half of the equation: you'd solve <i>your</i> problem, but not that of your clients. Are you going to tell every single one of them that they just need to spend more money on hardware?<p>When working with XML, you can choose to store the whole document in memory, but it's merely convenient, not compulsory. Using a SAX-like parser, you can stream the whole process and get a much smaller memory footprint.<p>Having never worked with YAML, I don't know whether the same argument applies.<p>This is more of a personal issue than an actual one, but another problem I have with JSON is that once you support it, people are going to demand you support JSONp - terribly convenient, but a major security hole.<p>Aside from that, JSON is obviously a great format for small, self-contained responses that can be consumed by both browsers and heavy applications. It just doesn't scale well with large responses.",1364284191

So based on reading the comments I can surmise that this is just a wealthy kid who wrote an overly hyped trivial app, got his banker/attorney parents to pay celebrities to appear in his cliched demo video and due to the pull of his parents, was able to convince Yahoo to buy his company. Him being a good actor was also a big help. Plus Yahoo needs to appear hip, what better way than acquiring a startup with a nice indie video?<p>Written this way, it all seems over the top and gives a strong impression of sour grapes, yet the above is a faithful summarization of this thread. It saddens me. Here is a more balanced view.<p>He is well off and has parents that are able to help him pursue his goals to enviable (as this thread can attest to) standards. You cannot begrudge them what you would yourself do given the chance. He has this opportunity and he used it to multiply his advantage.<p>It is not fair that he has this advantage and multiply not fair that he went geometric on it, but at least he did not waste it. How many kids his age, rich (or not) are writing interesting programs, leveraging connections and successfully cashing out? He certainly could have done worse than get a startup acquired by Yahoo. And If he did in fact merely sell them a plot of moon real estate then that too is impressive. Hustling? Hacking non mechanical systems? I don't like that he lied in that email but I'm not going to form an opinion without knowing him. Certainly, he is a very lucky  rich kid with a posh accent but most of you are also taking for granted how lucky you are yourselves.<p>He wrote an application that does <i>extractive summarization</i>. They are not trivial to write but can, with a day or so of work get to something that is objectively no worse than any other. This is because summaries are hard to judge. You will spend most of your [indefinite] time polishing sharp corner cases. At some point you hit a ceiling because any more effort requires a use of semantics and grammar that might as well be spent on <i>abstract summarization</i>. But now you are verging on AI completeness.<p>Anyhoo, he gave his not so run of the mill app a shiny coat of paint then used the initial storm of ridiculous hype from his well financed cliched video to attract trained talent.<p>He, with his parent's help was able to work out a deal and sell Yahoo a skilled team that had possibly interesting IP?

In it, Robert Haas (a committer) writes\nto Andres Freund (the principal author, I believe):<p><pre><code>  Before getting bogged down in technical commentary, let me say this\n  very clearly: I am enormously grateful for your work on this\n  project.  Logical replication based on WAL decoding is a feature of\n  enormous value that PostgreSQL has needed for a long time, and your\n  work has made that look like an achievable goal.  Furthermore, it\n  seems to me that you have pursued the community process with all the\n  vigor and sincerity for which anyone could ask.  Serious design\n  concerns were raised early in the process and you made radical\n  changes to the design which I believe have improved it tremendously,\n  and you've continued to display an outstanding attitude at every\n  phase of this process about which I can't say enough good things.\n  There is no question in my mind that this work is going to be the\n  beginning of a process that revolutionizes the way people think\n  about replication and PostgreSQL, and you deserve our sincere thanks\n  for that.\n \n  Now, the bad news is, I don't think it's very reasonable to try to\n  commit this to 9.3.  I think it is just too much stuff too late in\n  the cycle.  I've reviewed some of the patches from time to time but\n  there is a lot more stuff and it's big and complicated and it's not\n  really clear that we have the interface quite right yet, even though\n  I think it's also clear that we are a lot of closer than we were.  I\n  don't want to be fixing that during beta, much less after release.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CA+TgmoYhkMpkB8JZYhVei--h-onT-kT-Ko8bHvrrBUsewi_u-Q@mail.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CA+TgmoYhkMpkB8JZYhVei-...</a><p>The implications for PostgreSQL version upgrade alone are enormous.

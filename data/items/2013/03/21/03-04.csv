In terms of caring for something, and something being dependent on me, I know that this would stop me wanting to kill myself so much - but it would be out of guilt.

Like traditional athletes, our abilities start to dwindle after a certain age. We can't learn new technologies overnight, simply because our brain can't process information as quickly. Our memories become faded. It's sad to think about, but definitely worth planning for.<p>At the point in my life where I'm financially set for life and ready to move on, I plan to become a pilot in some capacity. Probably not for a traditional carrier, but maybe for sightseeing around NYC, or aerial photography. Aside from technology, flying is my other passion. I'm just not pursuing it commercially because it's a terrible career (salaries start at $20k, and you have to go through security every day. yuck!).",1363838262

I had a strong urge to tweet ""There's a guy with a Jagermeister hat and Green Day shirt reading a Berenstain Bears book in the doctor's waiting room"" a couple months ago, and as funny as it was, I wouldn't have posted a stranger's picture.<p>I think it's fine to vent on Twitter about the things going on around you, the medium is suited to that. It's easy to use it as your own personal live log. But it's not necessary and I think a privacy violation to post random pictures of people.<p>Perhaps she just takes a lot of pictures and was in super tweeting mode, like tweeting every meal and had a lapse of judgement? Didn't look at her other tweets. But that is the issue, that of the picture, correct? At first I didn't realize there was a link to a photo anyway and didn't know what the big deal is.

If I look at my daily toolset - between social networking, document management/creation, task tracking, work tools - I have on the order of 40 - 50 different tools.  Each one of those tools has taken me some amount of effort to really come up to speed on so that I'm productive.<p>For example - I use Evernote for tracking meetings, and I use Omnifocus for personal task tracking.  It took me 6-10 hours to learn the ins and outs of each of those tools - and I'm pretty happy with the way they work for me.  More importantly, I'm reasonably certain that both of those tools/services will be around several years from now, so I can continue to use them, track my tasks, without having to pick up a new tool.<p>This concept of <i>tool persistence</i> is really important and valuable for a certain segment of the population - and I think it's what Om is expressing here.  He doesn't really trust that Google will persist their attention to ""Keep"", because they've started shutting down other popular services after a few years, so what's to prevent them from doing the same thing with ""Keep"".

Although I think you knew that and did not intent to include the word ""not"" in the above statement, in which case, yes, it is improper to send out a DMCA Notice when you know the alleged CR is being used permissibly under Fair Use.<p>The same logic follows for all CR law, and law in general as a lawyer may not bring a case they know is frivolous or state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Improper behavior of this kind can open the door to Bar complaints against the lawyer; potential causes of action or sanctions against their client; and the awarding of attorney's fees against both the client and attorney personally.<p>>GoPro could then sue DigitalRev and/or Softlayer, who could then use fair use as a defense, but it would proceed as in any copyright infringement suit.<p>>If the complaining party then filed suit (against the poster, not the hoster), they would have to demonstrate infringement and the poster would have to demonstrate fair use (or the judge could throw it out if it was obvious).<p>Yes, Fair Use is a defense that would come into play in Court.  However, keep in mind a Judge can award attorneys fees and if any set of facts supports awarding fees it is  where: 1.) GoPro is improperly trying to use the DMCA Notice to enforce TM (assume there are valid CR also), 2. I am sure DigitalRev will respond to the DMCA Notice and the record will reflect DigitalRev explained to GoPro why this is Fair Use before any lawsuit was filed and 3.) any reasonable attorney should have known using a CR in a product review is Fair Use.<p>Thus,  Fair Use can be very powerful in the case of a DMCA, even before the case is filed, at least a case with these facts, because it creates a record that the party knew or should have known the case was frivolous before filing.  Attorney's know this and must advise their clients accordingly - a party will be less likely to file a CR infringement case if your attorney told is telling you the alleged violation is permissible under Fair Use and as such you are going to be exposed to paying the other parties fees?  Moreover, what attorney would expose themselves to sanctions and paying attorney's fees, which they would do their client has nothing but frivolous arguments (not supported by fact or law) why this is not Fair Use?  See how powerful alleging Fair Use can be on a DMCA matter before a case is even filed?",1363837535

I have been using Reader for years, and I'm mildly disappointing that they're closing it. I know perfectly well that there will be a dozen solid replacements that probably have more features before Reader actually dies. That's the way the tech world works - services close all the time for any number of reasons. None of them is all that special, though - if the service genuinely added value for lots of people, then there will be replacements, and if there isn't one, then make one yourself and bask in the profitability.<p>If you're that upset about it, then what do you really want from the tech world? A world where no service is ever killed or changed in a way that makes it less useful to you? We wouldn't have all of the awesome stuff that we have now if thousands of companies weren't willing to kill or change stuff that was unprofitable and take a chance on something new. At least Google is being pretty nice about it - we have months of notice and easy ways to get our feed lists out of Reader. They could have just up and pulled the plug without telling anyone or giving anyone a chance to get data out. Lots of services have been killed in just that way before.<p>Personally, I'm waiting a few weeks for all of the other services to settle down and get used to the massive traffic influx.

In fact, it becomes exponentially more expensive in proportion to the volume of the produced diamond. Most artificial diamond companies limit mass to 2-300mg per diamond because it gets much more expensive after that. Of course, we are speaking of optical-quality monocrystaline diamonds here. Polycrystaline diamonds are less expensive, but unsuitable for optical equipment (e.g. cell phone screens).<p>That's not to say the problem is hopeless; in fact, there has been some very interesting research done in recent years on low-pressure microwave-based diamond synthesis that could allow for very large, kilocarat-scale diamonds.

If we don't have to reinvent a global communications system to get experts talking to each other, build mines and refineries to produce chip-grade silicon or rebuild airplanes to get materials from around the world, this task is a lot simpler.<p>The biggest problem isn't that modern computers depend on some piece of technology or process that is lost to us. It's that all the people who understand every step in that chain, from survivalist blacksmiths who can smelt ore to make tools to industrial chemists who can fashion substances that nature doesn't readily provide to electrical engineers and developers who will actually program the damn computer in year 9, are currently widely dispersed. Put them together and give them what they need and I think they could get the job done more quickly than you think.<p>Of course, it's more likely that everything and everyone you need will be scattered around the world when this instant occurs, and if that's the case, I'd honestly bet it would take hundreds of years to independently reinvent a modern computer because you'd need to reinvent most of modern society to gather the people and the materials to do that.",1363837158

Magnetic memory is as you described, the other stores charge on the plate of a capacitor.

For hard drives we have read heads that must sweep so close to the spinning platter that they use the wing ground effect to float just over the surface. We no longer can read data with the write coil (not enough gain) so instead we use spin polarization sensors that pass currents of electrons with only one intrinsic spin and then measure the effect the magnetic field of the platter had on the spin of the electrons in the current.<p>In the case of solid state memory, we are able to pattern silicon wafers with a minimum feature size of 22nm and falling. A single chip is a seemingly miraculous network of chemically deposited thin films and optically patterned cutouts all at a size that beats the detraction limit of light. The mask (imagine an overhead projector's transparency) can not be shaped the same as the intended end-shape pattern of silicon due to very small scale refraction but never fear!

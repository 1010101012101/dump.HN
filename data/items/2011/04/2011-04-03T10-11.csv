It was built directly over a geological fault line, and is located near a second fault... Diablo Canyon was originally designed to withstand a 6.75 magnitude earthquake from four faults, including the nearby San Andreas and Hosgri faults.,[6] but was later upgraded to withstand a 7.5 magnitude quake.... In September 1981, PG&E discovered that a single set of blueprints was used for these structural supports; workers were supposed to have reversed the plans when switching to the second reactor, but did not.[11] According to Charles Perrow, the result of the error was that ""many parts were needlessly reinforced, while others, which should have been strengthened, were left untouched.""</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Canyon_Power_Plant"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_Canyon_Power_Plant</a><p>Or take a look at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, which is literally built <i>on the beach</i>: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Onofre_Nuclear_Generating_Station"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Onofre_Nuclear_Generating_S...</a>",1301828181

No trying to find config files everywhere, etc. The Windows registry is only used by some programs, and in my opinion, is not at all user friendly.<p>This would apply to the control panel and internal settings as well.

2402312,comment,2401498,2402169,11,0,asharp,,,"Starting a rebuttal with the word ""wrong"" seems rather counter-productive. If you have a reasonable point that disproves mine, then anybody reading it would notice this and as such the ""wrong"" is not required. If on the other hand, your point does not in fact counteract mine, then making such a strong statement seems rather foolish.<p>To begin:
* Uranite (U3O8) is a major ore of uranium <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Uraninite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Uraninite</a> and is in fact mostly uranium by weight.
* ""Uranium mining is the largest business in Niger and the life expectations is not much about 50 years there."" Is an example of 'correlation does not imply causation'.  To give you an example, the number of pirates have gone down over the last few hundred years. Global temperatures have gone up over the last few hundred years. From that information alone you cannot say that the lack of pirates causes global warming.<p>* I'd also mention here that there are large amounts of diamonds sourced from africa. A trade that is very profitable, yet leaves the people themselves with very little money nor increased standard of living.<p>* From the wikipedia article you specified: ""Because uranium ore emits radon gas, uranium mining can be more dangerous than other underground mining, unless adequate ventilation systems are installed."". Assuming these safeguards are met, I fail to see how it would be 2,000,000 times as dangerous as coal mining.<p>I will, however, correct my previous statement.
-Natural uranium has an energy density of 443,000MJ/kg
-Coal has an energy density of 32.5MJ/kg.<p>Hence to produce the same amount of energy as you can produce using one KG of natural uranium you require 13630kg of coal.<p>Assuming the risk of coal mining is measured in a certain number  of fatalities per kilogram mined (equivalent to a certain m^3 mined, given a constant density of the mined material) is R_C and R_U for coal and uranium respectively then the expected number of fatalities per ""1kg of uranium equivalent energy"" is then R_U and 13630R_C.<p>As such for coal to be ""safer"" 13630R_C needs to be < R_U, a statement I consider unlikely.",1301825482

Heck, it would even be possible to have a single public IP for a load balancer that redistributes requests to a data center full of servers that serve requests for thousands of sites. If you think this can't be done efficiently, think about these Cnoection: and oCnnection: headers that pop up with load balancers that only rewrite part of the header.<p>* NAT means that we only have one IP per Internet-connected household, not one per computer or other device. With mounting pressure, mobile operators will increasingly put their users behind NAT and maybe some people in address-starved regions of the world will only be able to get NATted connections from their provider. Software like Skype knows how to get around NAT pretty well, and UPnP works pretty well for other server-like programs that people have.<p>Which means that 99% of the people will be perfectly happy with multiple-occupancy HTTP service and UPnP/firewall piercing and not care at all whether IPv4 addresses run out or not.

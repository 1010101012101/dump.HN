I have since learned the tricks to get around many of OSX&#x27;s windowing quirks, but I do wonder how things like this have not been fixed.<p>I love my OSX setup now, but if I was a &quot;non-power-user&quot;, I think it would be completely unusable. Watching a typical Windows user try to maximize a window in OSX is pure pain.<p>Hit the + button: window gets a bit bigger, but not full screen.<p>Drag the window to the top: nothing happens.<p>Try to get to the edge of the window, and drag it out: RSI inducing frustration.<p>Windows seems to dominate as far as basic user usability goes on the windowing front. I would still find it completely unusable without the help of a windowing app like spectacle[1] or slate[2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://spectacleapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spectacleapp.com/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/jigish/slate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jigish/slate</a>",1400201990

7753204,comment,7749108,7750328,1,0,stinkytaco,,,">Ebook DRM is way more scary.<p>I&#x27;m curios about your use of the term &quot;scary&quot;. First of all, is the assumption that ebooks are a more valid form of information transmission or artistic expression than video? If it&#x27;s purely a question of information, then I&#x27;d argue that ebook DRM is largely irrelevant because the Internet has surpassed books as the primary information delivery tool (see: Wikipedia). [side note: I think it&#x27;s curious that as our access to some content has become more restricted, are access to other content has exploded. A person would never have had access to something like the Wikipedia outside a library 20 years ago, now you can get it on your phone wherever you are].<p>And it&#x27;s not like print books have gone away, nor like they will in the near future. Indeed, publishers are desperate to continue to sell them to you because they have more control over the distribution chain. This applies to video as well, for that matter.",1400201962

It&#x27;s not that stopping and starting takes any less energy for a car (particularly avehicle without regenerative braking), but that the <i>rider&#x27;s effort</i> is greater.  In fairness, the article states this, but the distinction could be clearer.<p>It does highlight just how much of an efficiency loss frequent stop/start traffic is.  In my experience, my most efficient travel (long distance at ~90 kph) is about 1.7x more fuel efficient than when I&#x27;m driving surface streets with frequent stops, based on liters/100km (US MGP ratings obscure this relationship).<p>As a cyclist, <i>in light traffic</i> I tend to the Idaho Stop practice.  There are a number of rationales:<p>• The injury a bicycle can inflict is generally vastly less than that of an automobile.<p>• Cyclists almost always have much better visibility and awareness of surrounding traffic, with the possible exception of traffic to the rear.<p>• Bicycles generally accelerate much more slowly from a stop than motor vehicles.<p>However, <i>in traffic</i> scenarios, I tend to fairly studiously adhere to the rules of the road.  Why?  Predictability, and my own risk.  If I&#x27;m following RoTR, drivers have a much better sense of where I&#x27;ll be, and <i>I</i> am less likely to get into an unpredictable (and likely harmful) situation.<p>One other item:  stop signs outside the US are often substituted for with &quot;give way&quot; signs (you&#x27;ll occasionally see &quot;yield&quot; in the US).  Where it isn&#x27;t necessary to <i>always</i> stop, cautioning drivers (and establishing legal rights of way) is considered sufficient.

The dynamics of the Soros&#x27; bet was in the other direction:  The Bank of England needed to expend foreign reserves in order to buy pounds, and the supply of foreign reserves is finite.<p>The other interesting dynamic in yuan/dollar:  China owns a sizeable amount of treasuries (since the US keeps running a trade deficit, they turn around and invest in interest-bearing bonds).  The treasuries are denominated in dollars:  If China decided to dump all the treasuries on the market at once (driving US interest rates through the roof, and the price of the T&#x27;s down), the US gov&#x27;t would just buy it&#x27;s debt back for pennies on the dollar.

7753086,comment,7752547,7752982,3,0,blocktuw,,,"I have heard many reasons for and against bicycle registration. Your reasons mostly mirror the reasons of vehicle registration; use of public roads is a privilege. However, as has been noted already in this thread bikes and cars are not the same.<p>I believe the initial reason for registering cars was about accountability and costs. Cars are dangerous because of their weight and velocity. They need to be respected because they can easily kill people. They also need infrastructure that is built to accommodate their size and weight.<p>I believe most calls for bike registration are about revenue and fairness while using public infrastructure. If bikes were taxed like cars, the yearly registration fee would be in the single digits (based on original purchase price, age, curb weight) and not worth collecting. Bike infrastructure costs much less than vehicle infrastructure to build and maintain.<p>Pedestrians do not pay tax to use the infrastructure (sidewalks). I don&#x27;t think they should pay.<p>In my ideal world bikes would be registered and pay taxes. They would be required to follow vehicle rules when on a road. However, cities should eliminate almost all roads in urban areas with high density and replace them with public transportation, bike highways, and pedestrian sidewalks. Density + cars is dangerous.<p>I&#x27;m live in Colorado and build software that helps cyclists avoid streets with heavy vehicle traffic.",1400199390

Some follow traffic signals, some don&#x27;t.  Some ride in the center of lane, some ride the edge of the rode, some ride on sidewalks in with pedestrians.  The scariest do all three out of what I can only assume is fearlessness and insanity.<p>This lack of &quot;normal&quot; behavior is very scary for people in cars and even on motorcycles.  We don&#x27;t want to kill bicyclists!  Bicyclists make up 2% of road fatalities in DC, vastly disproportionate to their numbers.<p>I think for all involved, the cyclists need to become more normalized and less random.  Standardizing the (IMHO) bad behavior doesn&#x27;t seem like the right(tm) answer.<p>The article has this insane circular logic, &quot;because bicyclists already break the law a bunch, it should be made the law&quot; -- rather than how we deal with it in other spaces &quot;time to crack down on people who break the law&quot;.  The result is the same, normalized behavior.  The author wants to normalize to TWO sets of rules, one for bicyclists -- one for everyone else (so everyone has to know TWO sets of rules) -- I want to normalize to ONE set of rules, the current rules of the road, so everyone can follow ONE set of rules -- and punish bicyclists for NOT FOLLOWING THE LAW.

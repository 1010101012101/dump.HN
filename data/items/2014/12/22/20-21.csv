I certainly don&#x27;t condone what they did, but on a relative scale, it&#x27;s a  pretty minor considering what other countries have done and still actively do. If they don&#x27;t include the atrocities the US committed in Vietnam in history books, you can be assured they won&#x27;t touch this either.<p>>> Maybe eventually, some new US president will decide that it&#x27;s time to prosecute and imprison them so US can have a &quot;clean start&quot; in its international relations.<p>Obama already tried being nice to these people we&#x27;re at war with and look what it got us.

See the BBF numbers above. CheapAir recently passed $1.5 million in bitcoin sales (<a href=""http://www.coindesk.com/cheapair-litecoin-dogecoin-flights/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.coindesk.com/cheapair-litecoin-dogecoin-flights/</a>). Newegg, although they quote no numbers, was sufficiently pleased with their Bitcoin sales that they decided to accept them in Canada in August. Same thing for Overstock who decided to expand bitcoin acceptance to their international market.<p>> Bitcoin solves problems that most people don&#x27;t care about(freedom) and creates problems they do(security).<p>Bitcoin solves a lot more than that. You must not be very familiar with it. I will give you 2 basic examples. The most important problem that Bitcoin solves is fraud: a merchant who receives a payment in bitcoins can be <i>assured</i> it won&#x27;t be &quot;charged back&quot; or &quot;cancelled&quot; due to fraud, because Bitcoin payements are cryptographically irreversible. So once a merchant receives a payment in Bitcoin, the product or service can be shipped or executed ASAP with no risk of fraud. And conversely, Bitcoin solves the problem of financial theft for customers: if Joe Schmo decides to pay a trusted merchant like Dell in bitcoins (as opposed to using a credit card) he can be assured that if Dell is hit by hackers who steal CC data, they won&#x27;t be able to financially steal from Joe, because the payment he made in bitcoins authorized cryptographically a certain amount of coins to be transferred, nothing more. Whereas if Joe had given his credit card information to Dell, hackers would have been able to initiate any number of other transactions.<p>Now, I do recognize that Bitcoin is not automatically easy and secure to use. But there are plenty of smart people working to make this happen: cryptographic 2-party escrow to deal with untrusted merchants (which is superior to 3-way escrows used by the traditional financial system: removing the third-party escrow simplifies the trust model), hardware wallets to deal with wallet security, etc.<p>> the actual transfer of funds isn&#x27;t the expensive part of remittance the compliance around the transfer of funds is<p>That&#x27;s false. Compliance in the financial industry is mostly automated: it is just software checks like who sends what to who, and data logging/retaining records. The most expensive part of the business is the requirement to have physical presence --offices and employees-- to deal with the need to be able to handle cash deposits and withdrawals. Bitcoin services make this cheaper because they don&#x27;t need physical presence. <a href=""https://www.sendbitcoin.mx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sendbitcoin.mx</a> for example accepts deposit by sending coins to their service, and they rely on the ATM network of an established bank for withdrawals. They are cheaper than Western Union for the same reason why simple.com is cheaper than traditional banks: they don&#x27;t have physical presence.",1419281872

His team are Jedi whose nobility depends on the pursuit of greatness over profit, believing the latter will always follow the former, stubbornly passing up near-term good opportunities to pursue great ones in the distance.

8785128,comment,8783495,8784761,0,0,jerf,,,"You&#x27;ve touched on the strawman about HE, but you&#x27;ve misidentified the source. It is the Marxists that want you to believe the psychopath claim, in their desire to stereotype capitalism as blind greed. Good capitalists that understand economics will perfectly happily include happiness and such in the value functions they use, because it turns out economic theory stops functioning without that assumption; it&#x27;s built in at the ground floor. By this, I mean, the <i>math</i> stops working, at the deepest and most profound level economics is <i>built</i> on the idea that entities have different value judgments, down at the microeconomics level where economics is actually meaningful.<p>And note the Marxists then wish to slide in the idea that <i>they</i> ought to get to set your value function, when you aren&#x27;t looking. (Which is part of the silliness at the core of the whole idea when they think they can set the same valuations for everyone, because, again, the math stops making sense and, what a surprise, indeed systems that truly attempt to function in a fully Marxist manner really do break down in a horrifyingly complete manner, as if they were trying to build an economy on the proposition that 1+1=3.)<p>The strawman idea comes from the Marxists, who generally don&#x27;t want you engaging with capitalist theory particularly fairly, since they would lose a big rhetorical weapon if you do.<p>You can not understand the anger about HE until you understand that Marxists desperately <i>need</i> humans to not behave &quot;slightly irrationally under some circumstances&quot; (the real scenario) but need humans to be <i>profoundly</i> irrational, so they can justify their handing over all sorts of power to the government so they can save everyone from themselves. Of course explaining exactly how the government will transcend being made out of irrational humans is conveniently left unexplained, since that is impossible. But, if humans were really <i>profoundly</i> irrational, we wouldn&#x27;t be having this argument, because our species would be long dead. People who want to believe that people are <i>profoundly</i> irrational on a massive scale must grapple with the problem that such behaviors lead to death in the real universe, and tend to be evolved out pretty quickly. (This is where the &quot;amusing&quot; comes from in my other post; humans are not <i>entirely</i> rational, but we&#x27;ve been tuned to be <i>surprisingly</i> rational in many ways... our <i>claimed reasons</i> however have not been so tuned.)<p>So the problem with HE isn&#x27;t that he&#x27;s utterly, utterly nonexistent... the problem with HE is that it&#x27;s a slightly imperfect model, and iterative systems like the economy being what they are, that imperfection can end up magnified in surprising nonlinear ways and have bizarre consequences, in a system that often has nonlinear and bizarre behaviors even if everyone <i>was</i> totally rational. So it important that science is done to determine the ways in which real humans deviate from HE... but these will generally be in relatively small ways, rather than the massive total failures of the model that the Marxists are searching for.",1419281278

I personally respect those who are clear in taking a stance even if I don&#x27;t agree with them -- they&#x27;ve found their niche.  The alternative is someone who&#x27;s trying to play short term efficiencies and please everyone -- all they say are words everyday, words that carry no weight or meaning behind them.<p>Pardon the jumbled metaphors and all that. :)<p>PS -- Being mindful of what you type on the internet, just like being mindful of what you say in real life, is helpful in being genuine.  Specifically it&#x27;s to understand what other people are trying to say, and also understand the ramifications of your own words.

I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a reality yet, at least not without a nuclear exchange. Drones, for the most part, are still essentially remote-controlled vehicles, operated by humans, particularly with respect to the decision to use force.<p>A scaled back version of that, which we might see emerge, before autonomous robots are used to crush a nation like it were a load of dirty laundry (or rather, before robots start to decide for themselves, which nations, or regions to crush), is infrastructure attacks that cripple things like electric and water services for extended periods, triggering cascades of famine and disease.

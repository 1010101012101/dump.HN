I&#x27;d sold quite a lot of shares in Norway, and traded quite a bit on NASDAQ via a US brokerage account (in 2000... yes, it got ugly; thankfully not that much money), and had income from both UK and Norway split between employment and contracting in the same tax year. And transfers back and forth between my UK, US and Norwegian accounts... To make it more annoying, UK and Norway have different tax years (Norway follow calendar year, UK does not). And to be honest my record-keeping at the time was shoddy to the extreme.<p>So I wrote a letter to UK and Norwegian tax authorities where I set out the details of my income, assets and losses as best I could. I told them I had no clue how to accurately figure out exactly what was due (for the US it was easy because it was all losses that year; the US brokerage account was just relevant because it provided deductions for losses on my Norwegian taxes). Gave them a number each that I thought was close to correct. Filled in my tax returns with estimates (and explained in my letters that the numbers were estimates). Both just accepted my estimate with no arguments, and no requests for further documentation. No fines, or angry letters, or conflicting estimated tax calculations or anything, which was what I feared when I sent it all off.",1444744534

It also protected the smaller suppliers (breweries) from the bigger ones by requiring that wholesalers be independent from the suppliers, who are independent from the retailers.<p>However, when you&#x27;re as big as InBevAB, you essentially own any wholesaler you deal with, since your sales will account for such an overwhelming share of their overall sales.<p>Many craft breweries can get around this three-tier system by operating their own brewpubs, where they produce and sell their product on the same premises.<p>I feel like the three-tier system has probably outlived its use and is likely more harmful than beneficial.",1444744440

The PH.D was charging a lot, but I really thought she  would help me.  I had a horrid case of anxiety, and panic attacks that came on during a holiday, and would go away.<p>I believed in Therapy, and really wanted it to work.  It didn&#x27;t work in the slightest.  It actually made things worse.  I didn&#x27;t learn any fancy tools.  I didn&#x27;t find any out anything about myself, that I didn&#x27;t already know.<p>I will say this though, if I didn&#x27;t go through therapy; I would always wonder if I could have changed my destiny.  In my case, I needed medication.<p>I found no difference between the PhD, and the MFCC.  I did talk to a psychiatrist about my unsuccess in therapy, he said I didn&#x27;t do it long enough.  I will never know if he was right?<p>Because I was feeling so bad, for so long, and those Therapy sessions were expensive, I was completely honest in therapy.  I  devulged  my innermost secrets, thoughts, warts, everything.  In my case, it just didn&#x27;t help my condition.<p>Drugs, time, and exercise helped my condition.  I&#x27;m still not the person I used to be before the breakdown though.  (I was told not to use word breakdown, but my brain just decided to breakdown.  If I said anything different, I would be lying.)<p>I don&#x27;t want to discourage anyone from seeking the help of a Therapist, but if you are a well adjusted individual, happy, going to school, or working, and don&#x27;t have any real complaints, but one day your brain decides to bust a gasket--I would try to see a Psychiatrist.  But even then a lot of them want you to go through therapy before they medicate you.<p>And if you decide to go through the medication route, realize you might be on the drugs a long time?  Especially the benzodiazepines.  I&#x27;m not sure if what I know now about addiction, I would have ever used them, but then again they are better than self medicating with booze?<p>It&#x27;s a shame  we still know so little about mental illness, or even how the brain works.

10380427,comment,10380038,10380038,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"My thoughts:<p>- Nothing unexpected really. When they did force touch on the Macbooks, we all knew it&#x27;d be coming to the phone and wireless trackpad, too.<p>- The lack of force touch on the magic mouse means developers are less inclined to create any essential force touch functionality into their software as a substantial number of their users this generation of hardware may just have the non-force touch mouse only. Not a really big deal (tons of old Macs without force touch around anyway), but if they&#x27;d been able to put force touch into every magic mouse too then you&#x27;d be able to create software that relies on force touch in a few years.<p>- Trackpad feels a tiiiiny bit too large now. Not a big deal, a little redundant area is somehow comfortable and its for a desktop environment anyway. But just look at the pinch gestures, the hand in the video is shown pinching to full stretch and there&#x27;s still area left to stretch even further.<p>- Can still see a lot of people complain about the mouse&#x27;s ergonomics. At what price, is it really? We&#x27;ve got plenty of great mice to choose from. The notion there are fewer moving parts is an interesting design choice, but it&#x27;s not exactly important in the way it is for say an internal combustion vs electric engine where you see differences in wear and tear and such. In my experience the lifetime of all my mice has been ridiculously. It&#x27;s certainly a nice looking design, but a higher elevation fits better in my hand and there are plenty of mice that offer that, offer wireless, offer swiping gestures and rechargeable batteries.<p>Anyway, the tl;dr overal takeaway is that these upgrades make a lot of sense and I&#x27;d be more than happy to upgrade as an existing MM/TP user, but I&#x27;m not enticed to switch if I wasn&#x27;t a MM1 / TP1 user to begin with.<p>Question to you all btw, have you seen anyone putting force touch into their software on a mac? I&#x27;ve literally used it 0 times in the past 6 months mostly because I don&#x27;t use safari, but I don&#x27;t see any developers jump in to provide any functionality, either yet.",1444744306

10380396,comment,10377342,10377342,0,0,jerf,,,"In order to see genuinely new developments, you need to be in an environment where something genuinely new is happening. Most modern languages are some combination of decades old, or semantically essentially identical to languages decades old. If it seems like we&#x27;re mostly shuffling the same basic ideas around and recombining them in those environments, well, yes, we absolutely are.<p>This is not as bad as it seems. There is something to be said with engineering with time-tested and well-established components. Even imperfect components with well-understood imperfections may be preferable to things that aren&#x27;t well-understood, but some guy somewhere says may be theoretically perfect. But the flip side of the landscape being well-explored is that there is little new stuff to discover.<p>Two major places where you can see legitimately new stuff come to mind. First, Haskell. By being seriously, no foolin&#x27; concerned about purity and immutability, there&#x27;s been a lot of work done in Haskell that in any other language, even those that sort of came close, was done by simply doing something impure and calling it a day.<p>Second, Rust. At the moment my perception of the community is that it is very young, the language is still changing significantly, and the concern right now is more about making new things work at all in the new paradigm than about the best way to do them. There&#x27;s a big influx right now of the very new programmers who will later be doing new experiments, but they&#x27;re still learning. Such exploration is absolutely necessary. But in the next year or two I bet we start to see a transition to more genuinely new things as the capabilities start to sink in, and the feedback loop between the real programs people are writing and what features the language grows develops.<p>(Personally, if you&#x27;re really <i>interested</i> in new things, I&#x27;d stay here rather than go to the really academic languages. It is my perception that the academic languages often have serious problems because they&#x27;ve cut themselves off from the practical world and severed themselves from an incredibly valuable feedback loop, the one that Haskell has used to propel itself to what success it has by actually letting real programmers into the sandbox to try to do real work. Academia is, in its own way, stuck in a rut right now at the limit, IMHO, where it all sort of looks very same-y to me.)",1444743969

They could not be overriden from the front panel, so electricians were dispatched to cut them off, in order to conduct an &quot;experiment&quot; in the wake of International Labour Day. How safe are the other reactor designs when malicious human intervention is considered is still a very open question.<p>I would also remark there was a deserved stream of criticism from the West both for the reactor design and the containment effort that followed. The overwhelming opinion throughout the 1990s-2000s was that the Western designs are safe and catastrophic scenarios like Chernobyl are implausible. Then Fukushima happens, the three reactors blow up and the only saving grace for Japan was the wind blowing oceanside. And the containment is done by low wage workers in sneakers, while Asimo and its advanced robot colleagues play robosoccer in Tokyo.<p>The narrative is now changed to other designs being &quot;inherently safe&quot;, although it&#x27;s not very plausible how <i>any</i> concentrated, massive release of energy can be made inherently safe. Yes you can reduce probabilities and exclude some catastrophic scenarios, but this is a thing with crises: they always come unexpected. I&#x27;m sure when the plug in a molten salt reactor fails for some reason (say tectonic shift from a quake), there will no doubt be another design touted as safe.<p>Now consider that fission power atm is what, 10-15% of compound world power generation? As of now it&#x27;s focused in a handful of nations, most of whom are known for safety culture. As it proliferates worldwide, the average quality of maintenance will decline and the number of stations would naturally multiply, so perhaps we&#x27;ll see a major nuclear accident every couple years instead of decades. And we haven&#x27;t even started with waste disposal and non-proliferation considerations here.<p>I&#x27;d really really rather wait for fusion.",1444743902

And, eventually these things are going to end-up in a landfill somewhere.<p>I truly don&#x27;t understand this push to de-cable keyboards, mice and touchpads that will be attached to something on your desk.  Every single one of our workstations, Mac or PC, has cabled keyboards and trackballs.  I can&#x27;t remember one single instance --in decades and hundreds of workstations-- of anyone, including myself, expressing any degree of inconvenience or any problem whatsoever related to cabled input devices.<p>The way I see it, adding batteries --of any kind-- to a device that could very reasonably be plugged in and forgotten about is the exact opposite of eco friendly.<p>The funny part you still have to have cables laying around because there will be a monthly two hour charging ritual --times N devices.  At least with disposable batteries one could pop in new batteries and get going.  Now, if you forget to charge, you&#x27;ll have to attach the cable for a couple of hours.  My guess is eventually people are going to leave the keyboard and touchpad plugged-in, again negating the reasoning for both non-eco-friendly lithium-ion batteries and wireless.<p>This is a design choice made purely for design and presented with a very twisted justification of eco-friendliness when, in reality, the opposite is true.  Outside of a few corner cases cabled devices would do just as well and be far more eco-friendly by a long shot.<p>There are many articles out there on the issues surrounding the production of lithium-ion chemistry cells.

With 3 network channels and the goal of maximizing ad revenue, you need a lot of stuff that a lot of people will watch, which mean generally adequate, inoffensive, middlebrow programming. Places like HBO and Netflix, though, live and die based on whether people a) sign up to pay, and b) keep paying. That gives a strong incentive to create very compelling, high-quality shows that a narrower audience will definitely watch. (I think the invention of reality TV has also helped, in that it has drained off the fraction of the audience that is happy with low-end, cheap-to-produce programming.)<p>Regarding me using an ad-blocker: your use of physical theft as an analogy for viewing content is just embarrassing on Hacker News. You should know better.<p>The difference is that if I steal headphones, the store is deprived of the headphones. Whereas if I read an article without also paying to download and display their ads, they still have the article. If they would like to only show content and ads at the same time, there are technological fixes they could apply. If they do, I won&#x27;t be working around them.<p>They presumably haven&#x27;t because there is value to them in people reading and sharing their content whether or not ads are viewed. And also because the marginal cost of a view is so small that it&#x27;s best expressed in scientific notation. Personally, I don&#x27;t bother trying not to read their stuff because a) I am looking for opportunities to pay people who are willing (e.g., I pay the NYT), b) I hope it&#x27;ll contribute to the signal to them that their ad-driven model is not sustainable, and c) I&#x27;m not the level of obsessive that is going to carefully decide which sites to visit because I might be costing large media companies epsilon cents until they get their acts together.",1444742763

What&#x27;s on Moments looks like a half-baked newspaper front page except when you click on an item, you go to tweets about that item instead of a full story.<p>I don&#x27;t want to pile on the project as it is new...but it should&#x27;ve been given more thought and design time given how much prominence &quot;Moments&quot; has on the interface (it is one of four main icons on the menubar)...Nearly all of the stories are hours old...e.g. &quot;Wave of terror attacks hits Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;Playboy covers up&quot;...&quot;FedEx truck splits in two&quot;, granted, is news to me...but not something that makes Twitter unique to me.<p>There&#x27;s so much more potential in the Trends section...OK, maybe Twitter wants to filter out potentially visually NSFW topics like #NoBraDay...but things like #MH17 and #VMworld and #ILoveYouAboutAsMuchAs...just show me an automated feed of tweets by reputable sources (rather than spambots or random kids) so I can understand why these topics are suddenly trending without having to click through the trends tag and sort through a overwhelming timeline.<p>edit: that said, I like all the other products...besides core Twitter, Vine and Periscope are standouts (at least, as a consumer)...I just think that &quot;Moments&quot; isn&#x27;t worth putting into the spotlight, unless there is literally nothing else to be proud of publicly.",1444741452

10380087,comment,10379948,10380025,0,0,alphapapa,,,"It seems unsuitable for coordinating mass protests to me, because it&#x27;s a single point of failure.  In many countries, the government controls all Internet access, so blocking Twitter would be relatively easy.  Sure, people can use Tor, but will enough people have it when Twitter gets blocked?<p>Seems like what&#x27;s really &quot;needed&quot; is a distributed Twitter-like platform, using a DHT or something.  Keep it small and simple enough, and a client could run on many devices 24/7, updating every a few times an hour, or more if the user&#x27;s actively using it.<p>User identity might be the hard part, because a long hash isn&#x27;t very human-friendly.  But perhaps that could be solved by a centralized directory authority mapping user ID hashes to Twitter-like usernames.  The mappings could be cached by clients in case the directory went down or got blocked.  Sort of like how PGP keyservers work, letting clients get keys when they need them and add them to their local keyring.",1444741426

I&#x27;ve basically agreed to work up to 15h/month with a 24h response time on any maintenance task (bug fixing, server issues, etc.). Whether I work 15h or less during the month, the amount they pay monthly is fixed.<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is how about months when there&#x27;s almost no work, say there was only 1-2 hours of maintenance to do. The client might be a bit frustrated because they pay me but there&#x27;s not much to do.<p>Do you have any clause in your contract to handle this? I was thinking, for example, if there&#x27;s one hour left or more, it goes to the next month, so there will be 16h next month. Or maybe I do some extra development work at no extra charge. No sure what is the best practice for this, and what would be fair.<p>Any suggestion?",1444741297

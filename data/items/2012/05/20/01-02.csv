3997681,comment,3995615,3995775,4,0,shasta,,,"The spheres are spikey, too, in the sense he means.  Fix a small radius and consider balls of that radius centered on the surface of the sphere as you increase dimension.  The volume of such neighborhoods that intersects the original sphere drops drastically.  Just consider the cone that has its apex at your point on the sphere and that extends to the one lower dimensional sphere at the intersection of the sphere and your local ball.  Even if your ball is so small that the cone has an apex angle of 89 degrees, that means that there is some fraction (less than one) of the cone base radius that you're losing.  And that reduces your volume in <i>each dimension</i>. So there is exponential loss of cone volume as the number of dimensions increases.",1337479102

Also, isolation distances on orders of millimeters are relevant for open air or PCB breakdown (with PCB-air interface having lower breakdown voltage than air or PCB alone due to possible water condensation) and not for isolated wiring inside transformer. It's pretty hard to imagine any failure mode that would cause short between connector casing without also causing breakdown between transformer windings.

Would there be a justify reason behind something called ""Stock exchange"" if everyone would know everything in the future?<p>And what do you mean by instantly? Like the first day or first year, or what? because as far as I remember everywhere I talked with bankers, everyone from teen that just turned 18 to a 95 years old grandpa withdrawing last savings were going to buy Facebook stock. But this is not what Friday has showed to us. 2 things; either: a) entire world change its mind overnight (I spoke with banker as late as last Thursday), or b) there was so much selling happening, that if the world was buying, it wasn't just enough to build demand and push the stock up. I go with gate #2, considering how much underwriters were willing to buildup on $38. A $300,000,000 worth dam!! I guarantee you, plenty of big fish is shitting in pants right now. To many of them this weekend, before Monday opening, is not a chilling out and relaxing time. I think by next Friday you will see some spectacular action on this stock.<p>Further, I think that Zynga, Groupon, Zillow, Linkedin, ZipCar, Pandora and others -- they are all assuming dramatically increase in revenue.

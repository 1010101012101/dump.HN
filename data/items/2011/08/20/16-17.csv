2907007,comment,2906656,2906656,2,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I've been meeting with two high school teachers from Silicon Valley who are enthusiastic about technology - especially ""edtech"" (education technology) - while still retaining a critical eye towards them. They are also remarkable teachers who apply as much science as art to their classrooms. One of them even crafted an organizational & classroom management system several years ago and has been training new, willing teachers in that system. Both also have impressive backgrounds (one is a Harvard grad, in case you care about that sorta thing) and work at a high school that serves a predominantly low-income, underprivileged population.<p>Long story short, these are the educators of the future. They aren't afraid technology and have evolved their teaching styles to mesh with it well. And younger teachers who are rising through the ranks now will be even more tech-savvy and progressive in mindset.<p>I'm pretty sure James Miller is correct in his article that higher education, as it is today, will change significantly. It has to. But I don't necessarily think it will mean a significant drop in demand for college professors. Perhaps there will be a significant drop in demand for <i>bad</i> college professors, but not good ones with an evolved teaching style (whatever that will be).",1313858757
2907006,comment,2903947,2903947,2,0,ferran411,,,"I can not speak for other dollar stores but please let me educate you on how Dollar Tree manages their corporate chain.<p>First off there should never be an expired item in the store. If by chance you happen to come across an expired item, by making an employee or manager aware the item will be removed from the shelves immediately.<p>Secondly if you look closely at many of the products in the store you will find brand names to be different but the manufactures to be fairly well known. Americans tend to buy known brand names, thanks to advertising. Ask anyone who works in a packaging and labeling factory and they will tell you they label the same product with multiple different branding labels.<p>With that said my final point. Many company's have to much product, Dollar Tree corporate finds these companies and offers to buy all of their over head that would otherwise go spoiled or unsold at less than 48 cents on the unit. A prime example is Chicken of the Sea tuna which is owned by Van Camp's, however in Dollar Tree it is simply labeled Van Camp's (same great tuna just a different label and 20 cents cheaper).<p>Items will only be thrown in the dumpster if they're damaged or expired. Otherwise they're sent to another branch location for sale if it doesn't sell well.<p>Sure Dollar Tree deals with mass production companies located in china and other ""cheap labor"" parts of the world, so does the rest of the big boys in the S&P 500.<p>In my community Dollar Tree is the only company that hasn't frozen wages, still offers competitive wages, and offers decent employee benefits. I do not work for Dollar Tree nor am I affiliated with them in anyway, I currently work for the black hole A&P.",1313858745

It's a fascinating - and disturbing - book, covering the exact topic you are talking about.<p>But where Colinvaux and myself would disagree with you, is the direction of the cause and effect.<p>My interpretation is that a society starts off warlike.  At some point it either conquers, or is conquered by its neighbors.  Once the empire is at its natural borders, war no longer provides a good economic rate of return.  People avoid the army and instead go into trade or farming.  The imperial peace provides a stable base for commerce and industry.  People become rich.  As they grow rich, and as the need for martial valor declines, people become more decadent.  They spend more on luxuries, they have less need for children.  Thus both a decline in fertility and a decline in aggressiveness are symptoms of the underlying cause (war no longer being necessary for survival, and war no longer providing a good rate of return).  Eventually though, on the borders of the empire some new, highly fertile, highly aggressive population arises.  Meanwhile the old growth civilization has long lost its martial prowess, and each individual resident faces a game theory optimum of continuing the decadence, rather than face the rigors of a martial life.  Thus the bordering tribe eventually is strong enough to invade, the old civilization falls, and the cycles of history continue.",1313857282

If they can find supporting documentation they can prove that material information was withheld that affected the purchasing decision of the consumer. This actually would be a pretty easy case to make. I would also argue that support has been dramatically affected by the fact that it is no longer a strategic offering by the corporation as such I would argue that the only remedy would be the release of webOS as an open source offering so that the implied support and future updates of the device can be restored to what was implied by industry norms. I would make the argument that the only way that I can get the support and updates that are implied in purchasing technology is for the OS to be removed from the hands of  company that has shown disregard for it's obligations to do so. While it is out of the norm to be able to force a company to give away a product via a class action, I think if they argued for punitive damages in lieu of open-sourcing it, if the damages where grievous enough, HP may opt for releasing the OS over the monetary damages.

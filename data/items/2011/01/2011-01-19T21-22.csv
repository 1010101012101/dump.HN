business HSI Comcast customers.  At the same time, I do maintain servers
in my own racks at a datacenter.<p>What is not mentioned in this letter, is that Comcast is already being
paid - by me, and by every other customer, for access to the content.<p>Note that Comcast has never said that the Level3/Netflix issue is about
users exceeding their allotted bandwidth (currently at about 250GB/month
for residential); presumably, were a Comcast user to use 249GB of
bandwidth downloading cute pictures of cats, Comcast would have no
objection.<p>It appears to be the specific issue that Netflix is a possible
competitor to Comcast's TV business, that somehow causes Comcast to
decide that there is a problem.<p>Understand this:  every Netflix video to be streamed, is specifically
requested by a Comcast user, operating under the Comcast-advertised
""High Speed Internet"" service and presumably within the bandwidth caps
that Comcast's own contract allows.<p>That Comcast presumes to have the right to limit, modify, or decide for
me which pieces of the Internet I can have access to, removes Comcast's
common carrier protections, calls into question the truth of your (meaning Comcast)
advertisements for the HSI service, and raises the issue of whether
Comcast is dealing in bad faith with each and every Comcast HSI subscriber.<p>====",1295474158

* Adults are clearly different from teenagers
* Teenagers are clearly different than children<p>A one size approach, probably won't work.<p>2. College Lectures are an outmoded form of teaching.  It'd better to have the lecture recorded and perfected, and then allow the student to watch it -- making sure to jot down their questions and then discuss with the professor and fellow students -- it's a better use of everyone's time and makes the content available to everyone.  In science and math I expect this to be a huge win at the lower levels where mechanical notation and rules need to be learned.<p>As we progress up the abstraction layer to where we need exemplars to train our ability to recognize patterns I think that computers will still have a long way to go -- this is where guided direction is important.<p>3.

I think it would be a great feature to improve for the next release.<p>At the moment, the reason we've held off from any of the proposals, is that they all seem to tightly constrain your data structures and/or patterns of use. You can:<p>* Encode the model type into the JSON data, assuming that arrays map to collections, and nested objects map to models (not always the case).<p>* Employ some sort of mapping function that walks over the incoming JSON data (already possible with ""parse"").<p>And there are still a number of open questions:<p>* Does saving an inner model save everything in the outer model as well?<p>* How do nested model updates play with RESTful URLs?<p>* Can I refresh a portion of a nested model from the server-side?<p>* Do I have to adopt some sort of JSON-Path notation to be able to refer to specific attributes of nested models?<p>For these reasons, we've left nested models and collections as something you can choose to implement yourself, as best fits your app. If a good pattern emerges with consensus behind it, I'd love to roll it in to Backbone proper.<p>For the record, DocumentCloud uses a lot of nested collections on models that are lazy loaded and lazy rendered when the data is first requested.

Mars lost its liquid water because (contrary to earth) it lost its atmosphere because it also lacks active plate tectonics (also, contrary to earth).<p>So our solar system has 2 earth-like planets ... with one that became a desert and died, but that was once very much like Earth, with some people still hoping to find microscopic life at the poles.<p>That's not too shabby. Basically it is considered that if a planet holds liquid water, then it can carry life (liquid water implies other things, like the presence of an atmosphere). Bigger solar systems may contain even more earth-like planets, but I agree: an average of 2 is way too high.<p>EDIT:<p>Also, one other thing: if Mars wouldn't have lost its atmosphere, then oxygen would have spread faster than on earth, because the planet is smaller, which means the transition from microscopic life to macro would have been faster.",1295473527

Let's say I work at a company, and I have skills U, V, W, and X, and I know the company's systems in and out. I've been there for 10 years and am an excellent employee.<p>The company needs someone with skills Y and Z, for some new project. They hire some kid, and pay him 30 or 40% more than they are paying me. They tell me they have to pay that, because there is a lot of competition for people with Y and Z. OK, fine--although if management had done their job and figured out we would need Y and Z ahead of time, I would have been happy to learn Y and Z.<p>So what happens a year down the road, when that new project is done, and we no longer need Y and Z, and that kid is now doing the same work I do--but with a lot less knowledge of the company systems, a lot less experience in U, V, W, and X, and is still making 30% more than me?<p>Is the company going to cut his pay to match mine? That won't work--the kid will quit. Are they going to raise my pay (and everyone else in a similar situation) to match the kid's? Probably not financially viable.<p>They are going to have to find something to do for the prior workers at this point, or moral is going to be low, and they will probably have a lot of people leaving.<p>Alternatively, if Y and Z turn out to be something the company still needs a year after hiring the kid, then by that time the rest of us will probably have learned them, too, after seeing how lucrative such skills are. Do we all get raises up to the kid's level? If we are actually now doing Y and Z we'd certainly expect at least equal pay.

Some people consider open standards to be <i>a priori</i> superior.  Others (like Gruber) do not.  (I'm taking your usage of ""open standard"" to include freedom from patent encumbrance.)<p>Your last statement is a critical point in this debate: You assert that Chrome dropping H.264 support ""could help HTML5 <video> see better adoption.""  This is not an uncontroversial statement, to put it mildly.<p>I frankly don't see how this move will aid adoption of the <video> element.  Yesterday, sites could encode to H.264 and provide a <video> element to some browsers and a Flash container to others.  Today, the same is true.  Yesterday, sites could encode to both H.264 and WebM.  Today, the same is true.  The only thing that has changed is that the number of browsers that require a Flash wrapper to play H.264 content has increased.<p>Sites will potentially use the <video> element over a Flash container for several reasons:<p>* If they cannot use Flash.  This is the case on iOS devices.  iOS has done more to drive adoption of <video> than any other factor to date.<p>* For political reasons.  Dropping H.264 support from Chrome will not change this; a site that avoids Flash because it is not free was presumably already encoding to WebM.<p>* Because the <video> element provides a better end-user experience.<p>For sites where this third case applies, dropping H.264 support may result in increased usage of WebM.  However, note that this is <i>not</i> the same as increasing adoption of the <video> element--dropping H.264 may influence the codec choices of sites that have already chosen <video> over Flash, but it has no influence on sites that are willing to use Flash.<p>I would be interested to hear your arguments on how dropping H.264 could increase usage of the <video> element in the long term.  I just don't see a case for it.<p>I <i>do</i> see a case that dropping H.264 might increase adoption of WebM.  I am, however, dubious.  So long as H.264 in a Flash wrapper is a viable fallback, I don't see any site choosing to encode to WebM as a result of this change. (Sites may choose to encode to WebM for other reasons--preference for freer standards or freedom from licensing fees--but in these cases, they would encode to WebM even if H.264 was available in Chrome.)<p>So, to summarize: You are trying to frame the debate in terms of freedom alone.  It is entirely valid to prefer freer technologies and to make decisions based on freedom.  This is not, however, the only possible debate, and it is not the debate John Gruber is engaging in.  To accuse him of hypocrisy in supporting H.264 but not Flash is to misunderstand his argument.",1295472041

We have found that twtbuck can work wonders for businesses where online sales or lead generation or sign ups are core part of business like Affiliate marketing(sales), Jobs, Travel, Daily deals, Coupons etc
We are starting a case study series for all these industries/markets to explain the role of Twtbuck and results that came after experimenting Twtbuck in each individual case.<p>Lets start with affiliate marketing :
Affiliate marketing is nothing but selling stuff online and earning the commission associated with it. Huge number of affiliate marketers are doing this to earn decent amount of money from Affiliate marketing. Normally the process involved is :
1. Select an affiliate product network like commission junction or clickbank. We tried Clickbank.
2. Select couple of products you want to market and create sales
3. Create a microsite, blog and fill related content and insert the affiliate links.
4. Use PPC to get targeted hits and create sales<p>Alright,  so we selected 5 products from clickbank with gravity score over 100. To begin with we started an advertiser account with $100 and created a total of 15 campaigns for those 5 products i.e. 3 tweet ad copies for each products. And set CPT ( cost per tweet) to a maximum of $0.10<p>All the accounts were active and publishers started tweeting those ads. We continued this experiment for around 3 weeks and 3 days, spent almost $350 in ads and generated a total revenue of around $3600",1295471623

You don't have to be <i>that</i> painfully conservative with the numbers to come with one or fewer per galaxy. For instance, 50% of stars having planets may be a brutal overestimate, a lot of stars are in multi-star systems or other situations in which there are no stable orbits, resulting in any initial planets getting ejected very quickly if they form at all. 2 Earth-like planets per star is a bold statement, depending on the exact definition of ""Earth-like"", we only have one in our system and if you read past the propaganda in the planet finding press releases they aren't coming up with all <i>that</i> many other ""Earth like"" planets yet. Yes, that's because they still can't see them, but the press releases convey a false sense of how the search is going when they do things like call a planet with a surface gravity of 3 or 4 G and a surface temperature beyond rock's liquification point a ""Super-Earth"". 10000 years is a bold estimate for how long a civ will be around and communicating, certainly. I actually am against the self-loathing that some circles find fashionable but 10,000 years is a long time. I consider these numbers generous and it <i>still</i> only comes up with 10.<p>It's missing some terms, too. Irregular galaxies [1], approximately 25% of the galaxies out there, are thought to be entirely unable to support complex life because basically all the stars in such galaxies will take a system through a region of the galaxy with too much radiation and sterilize the planets every few tens of millions of years. I mean this only as an example, you can go on naming more fairly reasonable criteria that eliminate half or more stars from contention for quite a while (star types, star galactic orbits, other galaxy attributes, even before we get to planets we can eliminate a lot).<p>To brutally abuse notation, the night sky is O(n^3) in size, if the probabilities of developing civilization are O(2^n)-type it doesn't matter how large the sky is. Big numbers fall fast when you multiply independent probabilities together, and it's not sophistication to just give up and declare there must be a lot of other civilizations out there; it's still a mathematical copout.

It's the same as a couple of cavemen sitting on a hill talking about thunder as being large rocks falling from a cliff in a faraway valley. It makes sense, it fits in with what we know, but it's really just a bunch of guesses connected with symbols that, based on context, we feel social approval towards. It's a mind-hack.

If you would not immediately greenlight $20k to have a security consultant spend one week auditing this feature extensively to avoid the timing attack, a) your app is <i>not important enough</i> for this level of security and b) this buys you no real security, just the illusion of it.<p>1.5)  This is totally security theatre if you have a registration process which checks for provided emails already being the in the DB, for example for telling people ""That email is taken.""  Different route through the maze but same cheese at the end.<p>2)  You can already spearphish people for their accounts on example.org .  Start with an email list of people.  Spearphish for their accounts irrespective of whether they have them or not.  Collect wins since losses cost your botnet nothing at the margin.<p>3)  MOST IMPORTANTLY: you're buying yourself six years of frustrated emails from customers which had <i>90% totally automatically discoverable solutions</i> if you do this the ""right"" way.  I'm speaking from experience.  Many of your customers have multiple emails they habitually use.  If you do the best practice, every time they misremember which one they signed up with, you get a support email.  <i>This will be your #1 cause of support emails and the cost for dealing with them is astronomically higher than the minimal marginal gain in security for your users.</i><p>Edit: Omnibus response for people doubting that a side channel attack is possible:<p>The attacker wins with microsecond precision over the open Internet and nanosecond precision over the local network, which is plausibly achievable on all of the cloud providers than HNers like to host their apps at.  Microsecond precision is enough to discriminate between ""record in DB"" and ""record not in DB"" on many plausible application architectures, even if your HTML/headers returned are exactly identical for the two cases (and they frequently won't be out of the box).<p>For example, the relevant code for Bingo Card Creator includes the line<p>user = User.find_by_username(params[:email])<p>This line takes approximately 30x longer to execute if it finds a user in the DB versus not finding a user.  Why?  ActiveRecord.  You could, if you had a mind to, trivially discriminate between the two cases in under a week over the open Internet.  If you <i>really</i> wanted to ruin my day, you could get a prepaid Visa card and get a VPS from Rackspace on the same intranet, then discriminate between the two responses in under an hour, again without tripping anything.<p>Some folks think there are trivial ways to defeat timing attacks.  You are either mistaken or you have a very different view of the word ""trivial"" than I do.",1343044525

4280466,comment,4279747,4279881,1,0,fmw,,,"You're wrong. Religion in antiquity <i>was</i> different. It was our first attempt at philosophy, even though many of the best Greek thinkers stopped believing as they slowly built their own sphere of knowledge as a real form of (natural) philosophy. As to your example, the Roman era: religion is, of course, a great way to justify an absolutist regime. Why is someone king? Because god wants it. This is one of the reasons why the surviving monarchies are still strongly tied to religion. They receive (in part) both their legitimacy and mission from the idea that they have a divine task as the monarch. It can be a great political tool in general, too, as anyone who is following American politics can confirm. The Romans were actually relatively tolerant, but there were limits. The problem with Christianity was that the early Christians were a rabble-rousing sect that was creating problems for the empire. Their claims were not only farfetched from the viewpoint of a Roman aristocrat, but also challenged the Roman way of life. Ironically, they marketed their faith to slaves, offering them the hope of a better life after death despite the numerous calls for slavery in particularly the old testament[0]. Despite the whole ""render unto Caesar"" story, they also refused to recognize the ""divinity"" of the emperor [1]. This wasn't a problem per se. You could be critical of the divinity of the Caesars privately, but the Christian sect went too far in their zeal  in their almost revolutionary and anarchistic spirit. Remember, Jesus preached that (assuming the sources we have are historically accurate on this point) the world was going to end. Most probably in the lifetime of his early followers (""Take therefore no thought of the morrow [...]"", Matthew 6:34). Jesus is just the only one we remember from a long line of fanatical, rabble-rousing preachers from Palestine[2] that created problems for the Romans by instigating revolts.<p>The Roman ruling class objected to Christianity because of its politics, not because it wasn't the ""state religion"". It absorbed many other cults (e.g. Serapis, Isis, Mithras, see the Wikipedia article on ""Religion in Ancient Rome""[3]).<p>Of course, intolerance goes hand in hand with religious fanaticism in any time, but the monotheistic religions are inherently more intolerant because of their rejection of anything other than their singular god. For the Romans, religion wasn't necessarily a fanatical pursuit, but a way to honor their ancestors and part of their politics. They were open to new religious ideas, as long as it didn't mock their way of life, and often adopted foreign cults as their own. In a way, very much alike to many modern believers, who take a little bit of everything in order to create their own, vague interpretation of spirituality.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_slavery</a><p>[1]: The divinity of the emperor was a complicated subject that can't really be compared to current religious worship in monotheism. Unlike the uneducated impression I have of Japan, for example, virtually no Romans actually believed that the emperor was a god in the modern sense of the word. It was mostly a honorific title, going back to Alexander the Great who was the first in a line of Greek/Roman rulers to explicitly compare himself with a mythical figure (Heracles in his case, who was not a god). In terms of absolute power over a major part of the human population at the time, however, the Roman emperor (and his Chinese equivalent) were  almost like gods.<p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_messiah_claimants</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants</a>.<p>[3]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome</a>",1343043614

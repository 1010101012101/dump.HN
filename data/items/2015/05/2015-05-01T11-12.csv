It pains  me to say so as a developer who would have loved the old platform to remain (I had to shut down a somewhat popular hobby website because I didn&#x27;t want to put in the effort to switch to OAuth). And as a user who misses a proper TweetDeck equivalent on the phone.<p>They didn&#x27;t win any friends in the developer community, but the article is about growth and it&#x27;s not clear they would have achieved the same level of growth with the majority of users on 3rd party apps.",1430481598

Still, there is a lot of people who try hard to limit their gameplay, to focus on their work, school and other activities. Procrastination (like reading Reddit/HN/Facebook several times a day) is quite similar.<p>My understanding is that to increase focus to the comparably unexciting work, you have to limit the activities that are easy, exciting and rewarding.<p>For some it is easy because they love their work so much, the work is not mentally draining, or they never tasted these easy and rewarding distractions. For others, it is a conscious effort and a life-long struggle to be productive and not spend your day on Facebook with maybe 3 hours of real work.<p>I believe that as drugs become easier to obtain, side-effect-free and happiness-inducing, the struggle with procrastination and escapism will be that much harder.",1430479230

But a proposition with a great deal of evidence behind it.<p>On the face of it, the options are these. (1) Maybe minds are what brains do, and ultimately physical in origin. (2) Maybe minds are immaterial spirits of some kind, and brains are just a distraction. (3) Maybe minds are immaterial spirits of some kind, and brains are how they interface to the material world.<p>The clearest evidence distinguishing these -- which heavily favours #1 over #2 and #3, as it turns out -- comes from seeing what happens when a brain is permanently or temporarily impaired by physical damage, drugs, oxygen shortage, electric shock, etc.<p>If #2 were right, those things shouldn&#x27;t affect your mind at all; but of course they do, so #2 is out. So dualists generally prefer some version of #3: the mind is no more created by the brain than a concert is created by the radio you hear it with, even though destroying the radio stops you hearing the concert.<p>But now imagine that you have an electronic box that plays music, and it turns out that if you damage it in one way then the violins all start playing out of tune, and if you damage it in another way then the music is all OK except that the singers go la-la-la instead of singing the right words, and if you damage it another way then every time you play sad music it stops working for a while. And another kind of damage leaves all the music kinda correct, but it&#x27;s performed mechanically and boringly and emotionlessly. And another kind means that whatever you do to it it only performs sad 19th-century German songs about love and death. You&#x27;d quickly come to the conclusion that it <i>isn&#x27;t</i> just a radio; it&#x27;s somehow generating the music itself.<p>The effects on the mind of messing physically with the brain are rather like that. Injuries in particular places can cause very specific kinds of disability -- a patient who&#x27;s mostly OK but can&#x27;t remember the names of any vegetables, or another who has lost the use of one arm but also <i>lost the ability to recognize that that arm doesn&#x27;t work</i>, etc., etc., etc. It&#x27;s all exactly what you&#x27;d expect if mental functions are implemented by the brain and damaging particular bits of brain damage particular mental functions.<p>It&#x27;s not a theorem; none of this is quite <i>proof</i>. It could be, e.g., that your mind is operated by an angel who watches for damage to your brain and interferes with the mind in just the way that the brain damage would produce if the mind were just a product of the brain. But it&#x27;s that kind of hypothesis you end up needing, if you seriously attempt to reconcile the observable facts with a belief that minds are separate from brains.",1430479205

Once you buy it, ship it, install it etc, I think $5k is a pretty typical cost figure.<p>That&#x27;s quite steep. It&#x27;s nearly 50% of your income. Also consider that as a rule, generally, the less affluent you are, the smaller percentage of income will be &#x27;disposable&#x27; income. i.e. if you make $100k, you might have $60k in essential expenses, the remaining 40% of your income can be spent on savings or non-essential consumption like holidays. But if you make $5k like an average person in India might, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to not spend the vast majority on essential spending. So an investment that&#x27;s 50% of a 1-year income may sound reasonable, but not when 95% of your income normally goes to essential expenses. That&#x27;d mean that you&#x27;d have to forgo 10 years of your entire disposable income to finance this.<p>Now how essential is it? I&#x27;ve traveled both in Africa and Asia and am familiar with powercuts (hell, I&#x27;d get em monthly in Montreal, too!) Generally though, it&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d spend a lot of money on to fix. Cooking and heating is still gas powered. Essential lighting tops out at 100W, no need for a $3.5k battery that can deliver 20x that power. My smartphone/laptop are battery powered.<p>I mean, don&#x27;t get me wrong, power cuts suck and nobody likes them. And for businesses (different story) they can be a disaster. (e.g. check out the World Bank &#x27;Doing Business&#x27; reports [0], they look at power cuts affecting industry. It&#x27;s a big factor)<p>But for homes? Most people cope just fine. You lose your TV and maybe your wifi if you don&#x27;t have mobile internet, the rest can be managed.<p>Anyway India is obviously going to become a huge market, but that&#x27;s a pretty long-term thing. You have hundreds of millions of middle class consumers in OECD countries who have the purchasing power and different motivations (environmental), backed by governments that are shifting to pro-solar, and huge profits-first industries that are seeing solar drop to super competitive prices within the next 10-20 years. India probably won&#x27;t be a huge market in comparison. China perhaps, they&#x27;re bigger, have more solar capacity and more purchasing power.<p>As for the scooter, you can buy 5-6 of them for the price of installing one of these, new, let alone second hand. And they&#x27;re an essential part of transportation for which having nothing, or public transport is often not a viable alternative.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.doingbusiness.org/reports</a>",1430478885

Problem: not all those ideas will benefit Twitter, some of them could even be detrimental to it. I think it&#x27;s a sort of common dilemma, my platform or theirs, my vision or the one of customers?

E.g. you could make your network service with a hard real-time limit of 100ms. On light load you serve all requests as you mentioned with ease, if load gets heavier you hit an uncommon situation (by definition, otherwise you would not be satisfied with soft-realtime) and everything changes, as you hit a rare situation.

In essence it is using a local school as a service rather than adopting its regime wholesale.<p>Out-of-schooling or outschooling is called &quot;education otherwise&quot; (EO) in the UK following legislation referring to a parent&#x27;s responsibility to ensure their child either attends school or gets a sufficient education otherwise than in school.<p>I&#x27;m glad they&#x27;ve made the distinction with home-schooling, which EO people in the UK usually use to refer to mimicking school at home, having a &quot;classroom&quot; and a parent acting as a teacher. Most non-school based learning is referred to as &quot;home-schooling&quot; or &quot;home education&quot; by outsiders it seems and very little of it is actually home-schooling; this leads to a quite wrong view of kids who&#x27;re getting educated outside of school as being shut-ins locked away from other kids and feeds in to the &quot;not attending school means they lack socialisation&quot; fallacy.<p>We started flexi-schooling to some success but in the UK it&#x27;s up to the individual headteacher (how&#x27;s that for a centrally planned education system) to allow it or not and our&#x27;s deferred to the governors who basically thought, and expressed, that the only way to learn anything is in a school. My wife and I are both graduates with science degrees working in our own creative business, she has a teaching qualification and we&#x27;ve both been leaders with kids organisations for many years; we work in a semi-teaching role and I&#x27;ve done IT education with individual adults. Apparently either of us could educate a class of 30 kids, we do on occassion (sometimes out of school), but educating our own child(ren) like that or a small group of EO kids is apparently impossible.<p>Anyway, we did flexi-schooling for a year (1 day in 10 out of school, we wanted 1 in 5) without authorisation with the eldest child [ie in opposition to the school&#x27;s expressed desire] - tests showed he was excelling despite the schools anticipation of abject educational demise.<p>Then the government brought in fines for non-authorised absence from school. This has weighed heavy, if we had the funds we&#x27;d just continue - it&#x27;s worth it - but we don&#x27;t have funds and so we&#x27;ve been unable to continue with what we consider (and the evidence suggests) is the best paedagogical approach for this particular child. The legislation is intended to stop people from taking their children on holiday in school time and their is scope in the system to accommodate flexi-schooling - and legislative support in the Education Act (and to a lesser extent the ECHR).<p>Were our child physically disabled, or indeed mentally challenged rather than excelling (just bright, not &#x27;gifted&#x27; incidentally) it seems the school would have given greater concessions. Catering for those with exceptional needs is an area in which flexi-schooling is often accepted and used to great effect.",1430478260

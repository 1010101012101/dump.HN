England would therefore find it her interest to import wine, and to purchase it by the exportation of cloth.</i><p><i>To produce the wine in Portugal, might require only the labour of 80 men for one year, and to produce the cloth in the same country, might require the labour of 90 men for the same time. It would therefore be advantageous for her to export wine in exchange for cloth. This exchange might even take place, notwithstanding that the commodity imported by Portugal could be produced there with less labour than in England.</i> <a href=""http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/readings/ricardo7.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.washington.edu/krumme/readings/ricardo7.html</a> [I know this from <i>The Rational Optimist</i>]<p>And, as Aaron concludes, you get better at whatever you do. So you might as well do what you love. Most of success is staying the distance - which is easier if you love it. The thing is, most people happen to ""love"" what they do well at; which I suspect means that it's not intrinsic love, but it makes us feel good about ourselves (a sense of mastery, objectively confirmed by others).<p>You can turn this around by lowering your standards, so that you feel good about any level of success - the smallest possible measurable improvement. This happens automatically in school - you're only competing with your peers, who (let's face it) are pretty crappy compared with ordinary adults. Yet you feel good if you do well compared with them.

2292400,comment,2292076,2292255,0,0,gojomo,,,"Kids know who the bad teachers are. Principals know, and schools have both student results year-over-year and evaluations which are good indicators. But these are confidential, and if you can't fire someone, have to keep paying them, and can't afford a replacement, you're highly unlikely to publicly finger problematic teachers as 'bad'. You have to pretend they're good enough, because they're all you've got.<p>Portraying this as just some unthinking partisan campaign against unions overlooks the fact that the total compensation of teachers and other public employees has been going up while service quality has stagnated or declined. They are being compensated for their reliable political power, not their value in providing necessary services.<p>And if the only decision criteria is, ""teachers are good, give them all the work rules and benefits their unions ask for"", there's no end to that trend. The full-time political operators in the unions, accountable for their groups' interests but not society's results, will continue to extract greater pay for worse results — until some other decision criteria, which says 'no' to the union in favor of other interests, can be applied.",1299358618

I'm a good programmer, I ""get"" programming but I'm far from even thinking about trying to teach others how to program. I'm simply identifying two typical sides of student population for programming. From my own experience there were two very apparent groups of students. Aptitude wise, there were those that were cut out for it and those that aren't. I was in the group of students who was [and I'm not even insinuating I'm at the top of that group] and it was in common agreement that the pacing of the courses was inappropriate for either group. It was too slow for us, and too fast for them. It's just not possible to strike that balance. The first year or two of college programming classes is really for weeding out the batch of people that aren't cut out for programming. The people that make it through this selection have yet to really enter into serious programming topics. My point for stating this, is to make it clear that Jr or Sr level students aren't seasoned, they are simply the selection of students are are capable and ready to be turned into good programmers. They are still seedlings though, and can't be expected to compete against some one at a professional level.<p>Perhaps my wording was a little to aggressive in my comment, I wasn't trying to attack the professor, I was only trying to make it a clear point that being comparative between a seasoned professor and naive programmer is well, absurd.",1299356942

Our current model is representative for western subjects; it can't predict, e. g., people who usually read Farsi. 
It also <i>only</i> predicts the first 3-5 seconds.<p>Here's the method:
In the eye-tracking studies, we present subjects with websites from different categories and track their fixations - more importantly, we also analyze the statistical features of the fixated spots (around 50 of them to date): color contrasts, luminance, shapes and location, to name a few of the very basic ones.<p>In the next step we build models based on the weight of these features and evaluate them with <i>other</i> eye-tracking studies as a gold standard. One eye-tracking study typically predicts another one with 90-95% accuracy for the first few seconds (ROC). With EyeQuant, and after 5 years of foundational research, we achieve around 84% predictive accuracy - that's pretty close to what you'll get with an empirical study, but the results are available within seconds.<p>Let me know if you have more questions!",1299356873

I don't know what eyequant's business model is, but it occurs to me that they could do an amusing sideline in training web-designers accurately to anticipate where people will look when they see web-pages. I feel that if I did 300 normal/eyequant pairs in sequence, I could gradually become aware both of my eye-movements, and also of those that people would normally make.<p>I'm reminded of the research that shows that the feedback loops available to doctors who predict disease from x-rays is too slow, so that often their skills deteriorate without them knowing as their career progresses. It was shown that if these doctors are given x-rays from the past to judge <i>where the results are already known</i>, so that they can then be given immediate feedback, their skills quickly recover and then improve. Feedback's obviously vital to learning.<p>Graphic designers, even if their web-pages are being A/B tested the whole time, just don't get sufficiently speedy and dense feedback to ever gain anything but the most rudimentary skill in anticipating where people's attention will go.<p>Eyequant seems to have this nailed.

2292242,comment,2291695,2291695,0,0,ScottBurson,,,"I think there's a more intuitive explanation than the Taylor series expansions (whose correctness, after all, is not exactly obvious).  It is not hard to show that the product of two complex numbers in polar form is:<p><pre><code>  (r1, θ1) ⋅ (r2, θ2) = (r1 ⋅ r2, θ1 + θ2)
</code></pre>
That is, the radii multiply, but the angles add.  If we consider only points on the unit circle, where the radii are all 1, clearly the product of any two such points is a third such point.<p>Now consider that<p><pre><code>  e ^ x =  lim ((1 + x/N) ^ N)
          N -> ∞
</code></pre>
This equation defines real exponentiation in terms of integer exponentiation, which in turn is defined in terms of multiplication.  To make it familiar, consider that<p><pre><code>  (1 + I/N) ^ NP 
</code></pre>
is the formula for compound interest, where I is the interest rate per period, P is the number of periods, and N is the number of compounding intervals per period.  Let's say P = 1 so we can ignore P.  If the interest rate is 12% annually and you're compounding monthly, then the balance after one year is higher by a factor of<p><pre><code>  (1 + .12/12) ^ 12 ≈ 1.1268249
</code></pre>
But you could compound daily, hourly, by the minute, second, millisecond, ...  As the compounding interval gets smaller, the result approaches<p><pre><code>  e ^ .12 ≈ 1.1274968
</code></pre>
Okay, let's put these two things together:<p><pre><code>  e ^ ix = lim (1 + ix/N) ^ N   [let ""N -> ∞"" be implicit]
         = lim (r, arcsin x/Nr) ^ N
     where r = √(1 + (ix/N) ^ 2)
</code></pre>
As N -> ∞, r -> 1 and arcsin x/N -> x/N, so this reduces to<p><pre><code>  e ^ ix = lim (1, x/N) ^ N
         = (1, lim (x/N) ⋅ N))
</code></pre>
Remember, the radii multiply, but the angles add!  This is the key step.  From here it's easy:<p><pre><code>  e ^ ix = (1, x)
</code></pre>
That's the general result; from there the special case is trivial:<p><pre><code>  e ^ iπ = (1, π) = cos π + i sin π = -1
</code></pre>

Different people have different feelings about it but in general paleo eating is more centrally about eliminating the consumption of processed sugars, excessive sodium, gluten, and lactose. Vegetables and fruits make up a significant portion of the diet and eating leaner game meats and fish is usually encouraged over the more fatty factory farm meats. The idea is basically just that things that have relatively recently become cornerstones of our diet, whether due to technological advances or otherwise, might not be so good for us because we didn't evolve with exposure to anything like them. It comes down to making choices like having an orange instead of a bowl of ice cream, some roasted asparagus instead of a buttery dinner roll, or a nice cut of rabbit instead of a 70% lean hamburger with melted cheese.

They are taught algos, some language basics, but they only have to code 2 or 3 small programs per week.<p>We had a programming club where we would solve 4-5 problems in one hour, and only like 5 people attended it, out of ALL CS majors of ALL years.<p>And that's, kids, why it's so damn hard to find good developers.",1299355446

Plus - here is the deal - Hubic offers true folder syncing (not like Dropbox or Onedrive, just one folder), plus they offer backup option only. The mobile device apps are pretty good. One thing I like about Hubic is it give expiry dates on shared links.<p>SugarSync doesn’t provide free space. Cubby has limited storage and you have to do a lot of work to get some space. Copy is not interesting anymore since they cut the referral program. Dropbox sucks because you have to do 30 referrals to get just a few Gig space. I find HubiC is pretty good and it now pretty fast, I am averaging 2-3 GB upload per hour which is pretty decent. Here is a sign up link to get you extra 5GB in addition to 25GB plus you can get 25 GB additional space for a total of 55GB of space easily on HubiC: <a href=""https://hubic.com/nl/offers?referral=CYHNPO"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hubic.com/nl/offers?referral=CYHNPO</a> .....<p>Just sign up with this link and you get the bonus space instead of the regular 25GB if you go directly through Hubic website. And you can have peace of mind HubiC is owned by OVH, they are pretty big internet hosting company, hosting is in Europe.<p>Right now they have 500,000 accounts, which is pretty impressive for a service that just started a couple of months ago.<p>If you decide to subscribe to their service, it’s starts at 80 cents per month, pretty good price, so no need to prepay chunk of money and you can cancel anytime.<p>Here is the link again:

First let&#x27;s take time out of the picture because there are too many factors to measure it properly... How close is a McDonalds, do you enjoy cooking, blah... blah...<p>Instead let&#x27;s compare on cost only...<p>When I originally posted I did not mention the dollar value menu, that is what was immediately posted as a response by someone else.  But since it is the lowest common denominator and the representation of McDonalds has cheap food...  Let&#x27;s try to approximate how much it costs in money only to make a &quot;dollar burger&quot;.<p>The dollar burger has only 1.5 ounces of meat.<p>Today when I checked my local grocer 80% lean ground was $2.48 a pound.  So that should make about 12 dollar burgers.<p>~21 cents per burger for hamburger<p>Hamburger buns were 68 cents for an eight pack; that&#x27;s 8.5 cents per burger.<p>It was $2.50 for an 8 pack of presliced cheese
These were much thicker higher quality cheese, and unsliced cheese can be bought far cheaper...
But we splurged so that&#x27;s another 32 cents per burger.<p>88 cents for a head of lettuce which will easily make 20+ dollar burgers so that&#x27;s 
4.4 cents per burger<p>So we add this up and we are now at a burger that costs 57.4 cents to make.  We still need to add a sprinkle of onion crumbs as well as a squirt of mustard and ketchup; I think we can safely assume that is going to cost less than the remaining 42.6 cents.<p>So yes; in fact I can make an equivalent burger for less than it costs at McDonalds.  If I was going to get a sandwich at McDonalds more likely I would end up with something that doesn&#x27;t totally suck, like the Big Mac, which averages $4.79 in the US.  For $4.79 I can make one hell of a burger.",1430447192

While I understand how they evolved, today it&#x27;s clear that the existing taxi business model needed to be disrupted in order to improve the consumer experience.  But that disruption has happened because of companies essentially violating existing regulations on taxi services.<p>On the other hand, I look at a business like GS, which generated its revenues by selling subscriptions to a service that dispensed content it did not produce, without compensating artists for the privilege, and I see nothing more than free riding on the backs of people who did the work to produce that content.<p>Of course, there&#x27;s an ironic counterpoint here: were it not for the Groovesharks of the world, it&#x27;s possible demand would never have been generated that now supports legal alternatives (in the same way that I&#x27;d claim music piracy is one of the reasons the iPod was ever brought to market).<p>Tricky. :)",1430446218

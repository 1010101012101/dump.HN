Japan is really big on that (as are most cultures, truth be known, but the forms are different).<p>If it were a Japanese CEO, I predict they would have taken a page out of the politicians' book: go to a busy train station, during the morning rush hour.  Stand on a footstool.  And shout the following for an hour:<p>""I am the president of Toyota!  I promise you we will not waste your money!  Thank you for giving us the chance to keep these jobs in Japan!  With your help we will proceed together to a beautiful future!  I am the president of Toyota!...""<p>There is a Japanese politician from the ruling party who is detailed to go to a large train or subway station, typically in Tokyo, and shout something like this.  Every.  Single.  Workday.  More than one when the government is hurting, for whatever reason.  The point is not to draw a crowd -- most people are busy on their way to work and pass straight by.  The point is not to draw a camera -- they could have thrown a press conference in a nice heated room with 15 handpicked reporters and been far less embarrassed about things.  The point is to demonstrate that <i>nothing I could possibly be doing this morning is more important than demonstrating my commitment to you</i>.  Even the Prime Minister is occasionally expected to put in an appearance.<p>Of course, the Toyota CEO won't have to do that groveling because he runs a business which makes money.  But if he didn't, oh boy, there would be an appropriate level of bowing and scraping.",1230033532

You should be scraping various sources to get content and saying at the top what the sources are. I feel like dev contractor search engines must exist already but I can't think of one.",1230032685

The ""safety"" of the product is in a mechanism that immediately shuts off the laser as soon as the beam is broken.<p>I have a hard time believing the FDA will approve such a device for consumers.",1230032621

There are many similar sites - but I have not yet found any that would make it easy to do the practical things - like finding people who would like to talk about a book (instead of just finding out who has read one), with added bonus if that was also location aware or finding bookclubs with most similar reading taste to mine.",1230031906

I don't know what is a fair comparison but <a href=""http://www.worldsalaries.org/employment-income.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.worldsalaries.org/employment-income.shtml</a> states that is US 30410/42028 vs Japan 25184/29882.<p>I would say that the bigger advantage that Japan car industry has is that they actually been always innovative, agile and reactive to markets. Hell, the whole ""agile method"" has some origination from Toyota. US industry has invented and started some markets like the SUV, but except for you guys, almost no-one else in their sane mind in the world buys them.",1230031119

But they are not written in a helpful way: you pretty much have to read it all every time in order to see what you need. If Google had the same attitude with their search, they would be satisfied with a query for ""george bush"" that returns the page of some random George Bush out there, you would have to add ""US president"" to get what you need.",1230030985

There are a myriad of ways they can figure out your password or log your keystrokes or memory to find it.<p>I feel that the real value in passwords is in securing network communications.  In that case you simply need to be sure the protocol is secure and does not send the password over the wire (or air) in plain text or an easily extractable format.<p>The chance of someone trying to brute force your online accounts or sniffing your network traffic is much more likely than someone sneaking into your office and booting your desktop from a live CD.  So I would rather have a very strong network password and a reasonably weak password manager passwords than not store my passwords and thus feel the pressure to make my online passwords easy to remember.",1263243392

Unreferenced BS follows.<p>As you pointed out children don't actually pick uplanguages that fast. It takes a motivated English native speaker about 600 hours to achieve near native fluency in German if they have any gift for languages. That's just classroom and home study, not talking immersion. It takes on the order of 10,000 hours for children to learn a language with <i>native</i> fluency.<p>Even for children who started learning a language by immersion before 14 (approximate cut-off point for native fluency) there's a decent statistical relationship between vocabulary and the age at which they started learning. Obviously if you moved with your parents to X at ten and are a voracious reader you'll beat the deprived kid from the slum estate, <i>statistical relationship.</i><p>Learning a language that's closely related to one you already speak isn't that hard if you are totally immersed. Grammar books, vocabulary lists, dictionaries, helpful native speakers all help tremendously. It is possible but incredibly hard for an 'adult' (14+) to learn a foreign language natively, unless they're a biological freak (hyperpolyglot, remembered from SciAm, treat with appropriate caution)",1263240874

As a previous commenter noted, $2k-$3k <i>just for the tank</i> is about right, at least for a new, light unit. If you're willing to go the solid steel route, you can probably still get something old and heavy [1] for under $1k, but good luck finding capacity at under $100/GGE (gasoline gallon equivalent).<p>Lastly, there's the safety question. Currently, CNG cars have remarkably good real-world crash experience. I don't believe there's a single tank burst or fire in a collision [2]. I'd be curious to know if other countries, with more lax regulations, have as good safety statistics.<p>TANSTAAFL<p>LNG (liquefied natural gas) is also quite different from LPG. I've looked into it, if only as an emergency reserve fuel tank. Turns out that to store it indefinitely requires refrigeration (or, presumably, absurd amounts of insulation), else it'll boil off, escaping out the pressure relief valve installed in the tank for just such an eventuality. Fortunately, like a pot of water on a stove, it doesn't all boil off at once, so there's little risk of leakage if one always uses enough vapor to keep the pressure down.<p>[1] To the tune of hundreds of pounds. This is less likely to be a concern for converting trucks, but I notice a fuel economy difference carrying just one adult passenger in my Civic GX.\n[2] I haven't looked this up in the last 3 years or so. Corrections/updates are appreciated.<p>Edit: added paragraph on LNG.",1263240604

I was still the prime mover but no one was getting paid until we started to ship products. We basically had equal amount of stock even though I started the company first and I took risk when no one else would. My experience is that it was a lot harder to get VC fundings when there were large number of co-Founders. VC's are not company builders and in order to ensure timely execution towards a financially successful exit, they would have no problem firing the Founder(s). So in some way, having a large number of co-Founders is sub-optimal (for the VC's).",1263240465

It's actually not an issue with tunnel splitter because all packets will come in order.  Tunnel splitter uses N standard TCP connections to tunnel through.  The actual data will come to tunnel splitter out of order and it will deal with reconstructing the data, not the OS.<p>As for the 6 15Mbps connections those were just arbitrary numbers I picked.  I'm currently stuck with sucky slower connections which is what I'm using it with.  And DSL not cable.  I'm not sure what you say about cable is true though since most cable modem speed cap is on the modem itself not at the ISP.  At least that used to be the case.  Also if you were using different ISPs that wouldn't be an issue, as long as they aren't sharing their network.<p>In terms of the pure linux routing solution, that is pretty interesting...   Does it require that the remote machine has two physical interfaces or could you do the same with virtual interfaces like eth0:0 and eth0:1.  Either way there are a few drawbacks with that solution.  It will send 100% of your traffic through it rather than being able to selectively proxy.

It is said that there are 100 viewers for every 1 content creator.

I failed to explain myself better how I wanted the FAQ to work. It shouldn't be static, but rather the quality of the FAQ will get better as students/educators suggests ways to improve/amend existing questions and will be updated accordingly (think moderated wiki). Any single question doesn't need to have one answer, but can have different take on the same question from different people. It can be in the form of videos or Texts. As for the educational resources itself (which will be different from the FAQ) will be made by educators in their respective fields.<p>Thats the way I was thinking about it, but not the way it came out. Regardless, I agree with you that in-person education experience is unique that can-not be replaces by other means (as far as experience is concerned), but the quality can definitely be improved, when the education resources is fine-tuned for the experience of learning as opposed to the experience of an education institute and everything that comes with it.<p>I am serious about this and I want this to happen, I am currently working on proposals and fine-tuning my ideas/plans of action to get some funds going to start working on something rudimentary and get feedback on it.

Living close to the edge doesn't make you work any better. If it did, you would have to question companies like Google who give their employees really good benefits.<p>$170k split four (or more) ways actually doesn't sound like much, especially when you consider their location (NYC), and their massive student debt. NYU isn't a cheap school.<p>On a personal note, I lived in Harlem on a $24k/yr grad student salary this past year. It was a reasonably comfortable living, but being poor in New York City adds a lot of stresses to life that don't exist elsewhere. Walking around piles of dog shit and trash every day takes its toll after awhile.<p>I was actually surprised how well I made out, considering I was making the least amount of money I have ever made since age 19 and living in the most expensive city I have ever lived in my life. That being said I could be a lot more comfortable with just a slightly higher income.",1274076047

It seems like they spent a lot of time and money figuring how to get the oil flowing. The question is, did they also spend enough time/money addressing how to prevent and react to failure scenarios?",1274076024

To avoid exactly the type of analysis, you need the capability to misrepresent yourself, and you need to regularly be in the habit  of  use use that capability.<p><pre><code>    Misrepresentation is using disinformation to frustrate data fusion\n    on the part of whomever it is that is watching you.  Some of it can\n    be low-tech, such as misrepresentation by paying your therapist in\n    cash under an assumed name.  Misrepresentation means arming yourself\n    not at Walmart but in living rooms.  Misrepresentation means swapping\n    affinity cards at random with like-minded folks.  Misrepresentation\n    means keeping an inventory of misconfigured webservers to proxy\n    through.  Misrepresentation means putting a motor-generator between\n    you and the Smart Grid.  Misrepresentation means using Tor for no\n    reason at all.  Misrepresentation means hiding in plain sight when\n    there is nowhere else to hide.  Misrepresentation means having not\n    one digital identity that you cherish, burnish, and protect, but\n    having as many as you can. \n </code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT-TGvYOBpI</a> <a href=""http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://geer.tinho.net/geer.blackhat.6viii14.txt</a>",1443297543

I&#x27;ve spent more time than most talking to homeless, helping them, and I consider many homeless people to be friends. A lot of them are mentally ill, and they are ill in ways that are easily identifiable from a brief encounter. However a lot of them are ill in ways that are just as damaging, but not easily identified. One rather common example: depression. From  the outside they look normal, but if you spend any time at all talking with them, it&#x27;s clear that something is very wrong. Some of them have trouble regulating their emotions, and it&#x27;s not that they just don&#x27;t try. It&#x27;s not a problem that they can think their way out of, and medication often isn&#x27;t that effective. Some of them are physically ill, but again, it&#x27;s not clear just looking at them that somethings wrong. One friend of mine had a heart attack, got MRSA in the hospital which became a 9 month ICU visit that cleared him out of all his money. The end result was six or seven years of homelessness, until he could get into subsidized housing.<p>Please note that I&#x27;m not saying that all homeless people are just in need of some love and understanding and then everything will be just ducky. The fact is that some homeless people are dangerous and should be locked up. I don&#x27;t have any trouble with that (although they should get psychological help while locked up).<p>If I had to guess, based on my (very) limited experience I&#x27;d say that about 1/3 of the homeless population is there because of addiction issues, and the remaining 2/3 has serious mental issues.<p>I agree that there needs to be &quot;expanded mental services, more rehabilitation&quot;, however I think the policing needs to be dome very carefully. From the tone of your post, I suspect your idea of &quot;strict policing&quot; is going to cause more harm than good. First, there are some civil rights issues -- it&#x27;s illegal (in the US) to discriminate against a class of people. That&#x27;s why cities can&#x27;t just kick out the homeless, just like they can&#x27;t ust kick out addicts, or black people. Second, strict policing of homelessness will end up throwing a vulnerable population into jails or prisons, both of which are expensive, overcrowded, and have many other serious problems.<p>The thing with homelessness is that there isn&#x27;t any easy, one-size-fits-all answer. It <i>is</i> a difficult problem, and one that will take time and money to address. I don&#x27;t have any easy answers, either. But there are a lot of people suffering. Also, don&#x27;t think that you are that far from homelessness. It&#x27;s not an &quot;us vs. them&quot; issue. Sooner or later <i>all</i> of us get old, or sick, and need someone to take care of us. That&#x27;s just how life is.",1443296974

Do you store all of the data that makes up one &quot;object&quot; in a single data structure, or do you store all of each &quot;member&quot; of each object in separate flat arrays?<p>If you need to use all of the &quot;members&quot; of an &quot;object&quot; at once, AoS is more efficient. But if you only need to use 1 or 2 members for a certain task, you will waste lots of memory bandwidth on data that isn&#x27;t needed for the current operation. In this case, an SoA layout can improve your performance by an order of magnitude, by insuring that only the data that is actually necessary for your task is loaded into cache.<p>The same principle applies to row vs. column-oriented databases, which obviously are orders of magnitude more sensitive to IO bandwidth usage.<p>One of the most damning criticisms of OOP, from this perspective, is that it encourages you to wrap up lots of potentially unnecessary data into monolithic &quot;objects&quot; without concern to memory layout or usage patterns, giving you AoS <i>and</i> bloated data structures.",1443295793

This one is very close, most of the major things are there.<p>I think you should look at some things from other common protocols to increase the robustness. Especially CAN (especially single-wire CAN J2411), RS-485 multi-master, and 1-Wire. Here are some thoughts:<p>- Increased Synchronization / Sampling: Async serial protocols usually sample at 16x the bit rate to determine the sampling point (CAN is 8x?.) You should increase the number of samples taken during synchronization. Clocks nowadays are much better than they were, especially using a crystal oscillator all the time, but you should still try communication +/- a few percent and make sure it is still robust. Look at this article for more information: <a href=""https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/2141"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/app-notes/index.mvp/id/21...</a><p>Also, a some implementations will &#x27;vote&#x27; on the majority value before determining the 0 or 1, i.e. sample 8 times during the bit and return the majority value. This helps with noise resistance.<p>- Use of timers and interrupt-on-change: This one might turn out to be a lot of work, but it would be nice to see an implementation that uses the timers and GPIO interrupts instead of using delayMicroseconds(). This will give you much better timing accuracy for sending and receiving, and frees up the processor to run an OS or other code in the background without having time taken out to watch the network and spin in delays. Also it doesn&#x27;t necessarily ruin the timing when other interrupts are running at the same time. I have not done a lot of Arduino work though so I don&#x27;t know how closely this would fit into the ecosystem... can you configure the timer/interrupt priority to use? Do all pins support interrupt-on-change?<p>- Better CRC/checksum: XOR CRC is not the best, as it is not as resistant to multiple bit errors. There are good, free algorithms for CRC checking. Look into pycrc which writes all the C code for you. <a href=""https://pycrc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pycrc.org</a><p>- Physical layer: add a small capacitor to simulate a long bus or many connected nodes. Simulate some bus faults. You should definitely look into getting an oscilloscope for this one, it can be very illuminating. Can you detect faults, by reading from the input while driving, to make sure the line is really what you want it to be? I&#x27;m not very familiar with AVRs but I know PICs could do it.<p>- Some way of auto-addressing: it is a pain to address things on the bus manually, to reprogram devices every time you want to add some more. Look into some sort of addressing scheme (similar to how 1-Wire handles addressing.) Maybe just a 64-bit random identifier and some sort of bus enumeration? Especially since there is no way to detect address collisions on the bus.<p>- At least wait 10 bit-times of zeros before returning with no collisions, since you can send 9 zeros normally (10 00000000)",1443294007

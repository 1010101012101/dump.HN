The only way ""other"" authentication could work is to check the user's IP address (which by itself adds only a bit of security - think of a public WiFi, e. g. Starbucks) or browser features (which is not a reliable security factor as this can easily be spoofed).<p>So, authentication usually works by transmitting session identification cookies.<p>httpOnly and secure flags come to mind when trying to secure session ids, but XSS can also be used to modify the DOM on the fly and to inject a nice little fake login form that lets you steal the sensitive information in plaintext (with a bit of user interaction though).<p>What else can you do with XSS? Drive-by downloads exploiting browser plugins, exploitation frameworks such as BeEF, keyloggers etc.<p>Edit: Non-persistent XSS is surely less dangerous than persistent XSS, but nevertheless, it is a threat and most of the time, an indicator for a generally flawed Web application that should not be downplayed.",1319197388

Not the gold standard, but, say, 1 coin is worth the average of a predetermined amount of the top 20 or 30 traded commodities in the market. Banks guarantee to exchange your coins for commodities at any time - bank chooses the exact commodity, but the amount is determined by the value of your coins. It would cost you more money than now to hold an account with the bank, as the bank needs to be able to guarantee to exchange coins for commodities at any time, and thus must store or otherwise arrange access to those commodities. This means you will be paid less interest. On the flip side, the value of your coins is always guaranteed and not based on reputation.

That hides many of the details of the protocol in use -- I imagine that you could run Django with a server that sends/receives web requests over FTP.<p>I don't know how you would make e.g that[1] work on FTP. Basically you would end up encapsulating HTTP <i>inside</i> FTP, not using one in place of the other.<p>A CGI script takes raw (yet conveniently split by the web server) HTTP data from ENV vars and stdin, and outputs HTTP data directly to stdout. Django HttpRequest and HttpResponse object merely provides a convenient helper for that and does not actually abstract anything. The web server pipes the response as is straight to the client via TCP (unless there is SSL, where it will just obliviously encrypt the stream).<p>To comply with that, as SPDY is a replacement to HTTP, mod_spdy transcodes stuff live [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/#django.http.HttpRequest.META"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/request-response/#...</a>

This of course is a matter to be determined by facts.<p>Even if it's shown that in fact she does not sleep around, then there's the question of whether that allegation defames the person in question. For example they may be widely publically assumed to have that lifestyle and so this statement would no more defame her than the allegation of lying (everybody lies).<p>So does she sleep around, perhaps this should be determined before the breaching the anonymity of her critic.

For many people on the left, intellectualism is an exclusive club, whose members must be the kind of folks described in Stuff White People Like. It must be fairly embarrassing that Republicans are still having internal debates on what their party really means, what the government's role should be in a crisis, how to come up with a compromise between socialized medicine and a generally capitalist economy -- while the left has become far more boring and monolithic. Meanwhile, the extreme libertarian right and the extreme authoritarian right has seen a resurgence online, while your typical extreme liberal sounds like his ideas are decades old (because they are).",1250774137

It's not nearly as elegant or as cool, but it gets the job done with minimal effort.<p>One note, which you all might find interesting. A lot of people have tried to do what daeken has done, not necessarily for botting purposes but in hope that the decrypted traffic would contain your opponent's holecards. I had a program at one point that someone built that decrypted about half of the incoming traffic. Not very useful, but cool nonetheless. A few people succeeded in decrypting the entire thing and discovered, to their dismay, that it doesn't contain holecard information. Go figure.<p>When a hand goes to showdown, the loser can muck his or her cards, meaning they don't show it to the table. Anyone seated at the table can view the hand history and see what the mucked cards were, but its hidden from people observing the table. The people who cracked the transport algorithm were able to extract this information, meaning they could log all the showdown hands for every game on PokerStars. I'm not sure what they did with this ability, but they could made some money quietly following around high stakes players, recording all of their hands and mucked cards, and selling it to their competition, who could use the information to decypher and exploit their weaknesses.<p>I wonder what PokerStars will do now...",1250773521

774924,comment,772567,772567,0,0,lowkey,,,"Cold-calling into an enterprise really isn't as hard as it seems. There are some simple techniques to help. First, remember you have something of value to offer to someone within the organization and you just need a little help to find the right person to speak with. The gatekeeper (the receptionist or executive assistant) is your friend. Her/his job is to screen out unimportant calls to make time for more important calls such as yours. As the founder and domain expert in your space (that's you), you have a significant advantage over a generic salesperson. You can gain credibility by highlighting this fact coupled with your years of experience and passion for addressing this specific problem.<p>Here is an example intro:
""Hi <receptionist name>, my name is Bob from SmartCo Software, inc. SmartCo is a software company that my partner and I co-founded to help companies in the <widget industry> who are facing challenges managing their <grommet inventory>. I am trying to find the appropriate person to speak with in your organization. Who would be the best person to contact about this? <wait for response><p>More tips:<p>1. Your tone should be friendly, confident, and business-like. If it sounds like you are nervous they will hear this and it and may perceive this as a sign that you would be wasting their management's valuable time. Smile wide on the phone (literally, it shines through on the call.)<p>2. Keep it short and clear using plain simple words. You are not trying to sell the gatekeeper on your technology, product or service. You only need to convince them that the person you are looking for may be interested and that you sound professional enough that passing along your call won't come back and bite them.<p>3. With both gatekeepers and prospects, use your passion and founder status to your advantage. Be a person and talk with the prospect as an equal.<p>4. Old Sales Adage: ""Telling isn't Selling"" (i.e. Asking questions) Once you have identified a target buyer your goal is to give them just enough context about your company and the problem you are solving to get them thinking about the space, your goal then is to get your prospect talking. Ask open ended questions that cannot be answered with a simple yes or no. (e.g. I have been speaking with <CEO/CFO/COO/CMO>s in <prospect's industry> and many of them tell me that they are facing increasing difficulty <managing the cost of grommet maintenance>. Can you tell me how <prospect Co> has addressed these issues and what sort of initiatives you have considered? - take notes)<p>5. There is a lot more but I've typed enough for now.<p>The keys to shortening the sales cycle are:<p>* good upfront qualification (and dis-qualification) of prospects,<p>* a very clear process and next steps defined by the seller (uncertainty as to what the product/service does, what it costs, and how well it will work will all work against you)<p>* Pro-active follow through on the part of the sellor<p>* Not all calls will go well, but remember the ocean of prospects is large. The rule of prospecting is: SWSWSWN (some will, some won't, so what?, next!)",1250773374

9086640,comment,9085563,9086490,0,0,jahewson,,,"When will a deallocation occur? When release is called and the referece count is zero. This is deterministic, unlike GC which will perform the deallocation when it feels like it.<p>I think you&#x27;ve confused determinism with regards to a program and the inputs to that program. Any retain/release program is deterministic because it always behaves in the same manner. Given any possible input I can tell you exactly when and on which lines of code the deallocations will occur. You can&#x27;t know that with GC, especially when other libraries and threads enter the equation.<p>Which deallocations occur and in which order depend on the input to the program, but we still know in advance all possible lines of code where specific deallocations can occur and we have complete control over that. With GC we wouldn&#x27;t know that and we couldn&#x27;t control it.<p>Knowing when deallocations can occur and having control over that is the reason to choose ARC over GC in the first place. Not the other way around. With respect to manual retain/release, ARC doesn&#x27;t take anything away: I can still retain an extra count of a large object to prevent its untimely release and share that object via ARC at the same time.",1424548550
9086639,comment,9086475,9086475,0,0,lucisferre,,,"My wife and I are co-founders and we have a 3 year-old daughter. Our startup is also still in its early stages, so things are pretty busy and often chaotic. I can definitely say that, as a necessity, we&#x27;ve become much better at time management than we ever were before.<p>Our days are fairly planned and we try to keep things routine as much as possible, consistency helps immensely. Also we&#x27;ve managed to ensure everything we need is fairly close by. We live about 10-15 minutes from work and our daycare and gym are both in close proximity to our office. We each typically have two scheduled mornings a week to hit the gym, one of us goes to the gym and the other deals with daycare. We also occasionally hand off daycare pick-up to allow the other to work a bit later. In fact, we hand-off on a lot of things to make everything work, particularly meetings, typically only one of us will go so the other can stay at work and grind on other things. As a software developer this is pretty important, I can skip out of a lot of meetings and keep working on product and we can catch up on what happened in the evening.<p>Having a child means our days need to be somewhat time-boxed so there&#x27;s little room for severely late work hours. I actually believe this to be a good thing, as I&#x27;m forced to get the most out of my work time and continue to improve on my time management skills. That said, we&#x27;re often catching up on things during downtime, weekends, evenings and since we live together, we have the advantage (or disadvantage depending on how you look at it) of being able to discuss work whenever we need to. To make things even more interesting my brother and father work in a related business, so family dinners can be... interesting.<p>Outside of that we try to keep everything pretty normal and we enjoy our downtime. We like to cook a lot, we make a regular trip to the market most Saturdays with our daughter. We cook dinner with our daughter often and eat at home often which provides valuable family time. The grandparents usually watch our daughter on Friday nights so we can hang out of with friends once a week as well, and we occasionally sneak out to have a drink together, after her bed-time, while they stay and watch her.<p>Almost all of our family lives nearby, so my parents and her parents help out a lot. It really starts to become a team effort to make everything work out without an excessive level of stress. I can&#x27;t stress enough how important family is when things get to this level of &quot;busy&quot;.<p>Like most people here, we love what we do. We don&#x27;t mind being somewhat &quot;always on&quot; and we try to plan our lives in a way the reminds us to do other things too and not to neglect family and friends. That&#x27;s the bigger challenge I think, not figuring out how to work hard at something you love, but remembering to live your life too.<p>Overall, we are very fortunate things have worked out as well as they have.",1424548528

9086633,comment,9086102,9086102,0,0,hooande,,,"&quot;Art&quot; is a concept that obviously has no one definition. For many people, art is synonymous with beauty. If they look at it and like it, it&#x27;s art. I wasn&#x27;t personally moved in this way by google maps or the iphone, but I understand that many people were. So I think the answer to the question posed in the post title for most people is &quot;Yes, or close enough&quot;.<p>Another function that can define art, as opposed to aesthetic beauty, is causing people to see the world in a new way. Some of the greatest art take something familiar and causes people to see it in a new way, or takes common tools and uses them in a way that is somehow surprising or unexpected (ie, the Mona Lisa or Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony). I have seen and been a part of software that <i>delighted</i> people. I&#x27;ve seen simple web utilities inexplicably bring smiles to peoples&#x27; faces and moments of joy into their lives. I&#x27;ll spend the rest of my life trying to do that again, to recapture that glimpse of magic. And I probably won&#x27;t even come close. If that isn&#x27;t art, then I don&#x27;t know what is.<p>Art can have many forms, it&#x27;s a loosely defined term by intention. But <i>good</i> art does have a definition. Sometimes software and hardware can elevate to reach that height, but most of it does not. I wish I could think of more examples of artistic technology products, but nothing really jumps out at the moment. To quote the Supreme Court when answering a similar question, &quot;I know it when I see it.&quot;",1424548425

But are these the most natural points of interaction with AI assistants, or is there a device even more fundamental? Windows 10 is rolling out embedded AI (Cortanna) that hopefully will allow more intuitive interaction with the Windows universe (Word, Outlook, etc.). So we will start seeing AI for computers--and maybe Siri will be more present in MacBooks. As yorak said, I also believe AI assistants will become the predominant way people interact with the digital world. I see companies like VIV disrupting search engines and potentially becoming the next Googles of the world. Just as our FBook and Google accounts are becoming universal online identities and accesspoints into other services, perhaps so too will people subscribe as a utility to their favorite AI assistant, which across devices/platforms, can know the users&#x27; preferences and evolve the service.<p>But again, what is the entrypoint device that will really make AI assistants widely used?",1424548275

Here&#x27;s an excerpt:<p><i>Programs written in source code also share many of the linguistic elements of texts written in natural languages, like German or French... For First Amendment purposes, the use of language is highly significant. Languages are made up of conventions, regular ways of expressing and communicating thoughts and ideas shared by a group of speakers...<p>Language can be technical, and even arcane, but that does not make it any less like language. A native speaker of English, untrained in medicine, might have difficulty understanding the discussion of a cancer patient&#x27;s progress. The vocabulary is different even if the grammar is not. Musicians use artificial notation for writing and reading music. Mathematicians and scientists do the same to express concepts important in their fields, with grammar and other conventions that may be wholly incomprehensible to the uninitiated...<p>For every shared language, natural or artificial, however, there is a community of speakers and listeners (or readers) for whom the language is both comprehensible and for which the language is its conventional form of communication. To belong to a community is to speak its language...</i><p>That&#x27;s from a brief submitted by attorneys for the late Peter Junger  (<a href=""http://louisville.edu/faculty/ddking01/cecs311/cases/Junger%20v%20Daley%20--%20ACLU%20Brief.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://louisville.edu/faculty/ddking01/cecs311/cases/Junger%...</a>) in an effort to attack FedGov encryption export controls.<p>If source code can be expressive, and it is, then it can be art.

I&#x27;d expect that the energy would cause fluid/molden volumes to circulate. This would create motion relative to the energy source.<p>It might be possible to use this same kind of circulation effect to have a self-contained space-craft. It would consume solar energy, and then strategically pump volumes of fluid from one end to the other, to deliberately change its momentum.",1424545297

9086457,comment,9083849,9083849,0,0,hosh,,,"Wow, had a bunch of ideas that came up after a good night&#x27;s sleep.<p>- This is what many of my friends initially thought &quot;Cloud Technology&quot; was, and were disappointed to find out that the cloud tech we have today isn&#x27;t truly peer-to-peer.<p>- This has immediate application for distributing data generated by governments.<p>- I don&#x27;t have to use rsync or capistrano to deploy websites. I can write locally to an ipfs content address, and the servers will automatically pick it up.<p>- This would be awesome as a way to distribute public Docker containers or App containers.<p>- Containers + ipfs can potentially make for a highly portable app, one where both the code and the data are portable. At the very least, you wouldn&#x27;t have to create a data container and link a different container to get that data out. Some potentials are things like redesigning Diaspora, or even running distributed copies of OpenFarm. (Any non-profit, open-sourced crowd-sourced data project, like OpenFarm, would seriously benefit from this -- people can contribute compute, network, and storage by installing a container with that stuff already there).<p>- DRM might actually work. (I&#x27;ve brought this up before, and it has been really unpopular with people since they are not rationally thinking about the societal value of DRM). The problem with current DRM schemes is that it puts the power on the side of the merchants. Using neutral third party schemes don&#x27;t work well. There is also the problem of when the merchant shuts down and kills the asset servers. What we really want to do is register rights in a p2p setting like with Counterparty or one of the blockchain technology. IPFS would solve the asset distribution and storage problem. (Enforcement is interesting, and one potential idea that just bubbled up: if you can have a web of trust, you can have a web of distrust; use peer pressure to mitigate bad actors; this works well if people actually want some reasonable way of having property rights over data).<p>- Promise Theory. Been reading and thinking a lot about this. I see promise theory as a possibility for helping with human-to-AI interactions. It&#x27;s core premise is based upon documenting intent and evaluating trust in actions out in the open. IPFS would allow AIs to publish intent as well as publish their evaluation of trust. This allows for reputation management for AIs.<p>- A similar application above would work for reputation management for humans. For example, TaskRabbit, ELance, and other gig markets currently lock up reputation data as proprietary. On the other hand, reputation published on IPFS would be portable. (It could also be built on web-of-trust, something brought up by that co-opt consultancy posted here). This is also an application of Promise Theory.<p>The ideas keep coming up, will start up an ipfs node and store some of that there.",1424545265

4856893,comment,4856272,4856272,1,0,mvleming,,,"Both of my parents are educators (one is a teacher, the other a principal), and so they raised me believing that education is important. And I've been so fortunate in this regard. Yet, despite this, my education has been a great source of stress and frustration in my life. I've been in both the public and private school systems. I've been homeschooled. I've received credits from online.<p>And so, I've thought a lot about how we can fix the current education system. I have one simple answer for you: have the students pay a percentage of their salary after they graduate. That's it. Not a tuition, a percentage.<p>What would this change? Oh my god so much!<p>The universities would have an incentive to get their students jobs. The students wouldn't have to get loans. And those who normally couldn't afford the tuition could go to university now.<p>In one full swing, this business model would reduce unemployment, national debt, and poverty. But you're also creating an incentive for the universities to <i>innovate</i>. I can just see something like A/B Testing being set up. ""Okay. So are you telling me students who take the general courses do not earn more than the student's who don't? Get rid of these courses!""<p>I came up with this one sentence a while that I think best describes where we are today with education:<p>As more and more information gets documented and distributed freely, the role for the classroom to inform the student becomes less and less relevant.<p>We're in very interesting times.",1354337751

If someone were to make a program that, in real time, takes screencaps of a movie being played back by a legal Blu-ray disc player and records the audio output from the player, then recombines that fully unencrypted data into a video file also without DRM, that person would <i>most definitely</i> get hit with a lawsuit on the basis of the DMCA.<p>0: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Access_Content_System</a>",1354337433

MHA, PRM, MMM, Tungsten, DRBD - all were written by people who know a lot about MySQL database failover, and yes, they still have problems. The reason they have problems is because doing failover properly under load is a <i>hard</i> problem to solve.<p>As for them not production ready? Sounds like a line being fed by someone who wants to sell their own solution. I have personally seen all of these solutions in use in production systems.<p>Some of the potential problems I note with your solution (and if you haven't been bitten by these yet, you will at some point):<p>1) You need to break existing connections to the old master. This is the single biggest cause of split brain that I've seen in these situations. SET GLOBAL read_only=1 only affects new connections.<p>2) You should verify that the slave has read <i>and applied</i> all of the logs from the master, to ensure that no data is lost when the slave is stopped.<p>3) You really should capture the binlog file & position from the slave <i>after</i> stopping the slave, to avoid getting inconsistant data in your two databases.<p>4) You may want to ensure that the arp change actually took effect on your proxy machine: prior to unlocking the proxy, make a connection from the proxy server to the VIP & verify that the server_id matches the slave's server_id.<p>MHA has a number of problems when considered as an automated failover solution. However, it's not required to run in an automated fashion to do manual failovers like this, and is quite good at doing them correctly; it encapsulates the lessons learned from its predecessors, and the knowledge of the engineers who have been bitten by doing a failover under load incorrectly.<p>There are some really great tools out there, and not using them (or learning from them) is going to cause your DBAs hours of hard work to get your DBs back in operational order when something goes wrong.

As the saying goes, all politics is local.<p>That said, to address your rhetorical point...it's not just about hardened criminals. It's not an either or situation...there's many types of states between evil criminal and innocent civilian. Just as suicide barriers and other inconveniences actually deter suicides...even though you think that anyone who would commit suicide would bypass them...gun control laws deter those who would commit gun crimes just because they had a gun at the moment.<p>I'll give you a concrete example. In NYC, I've seen pedestrians and cyclists kick and punch cars that nearly run them over...and this is not an uncommon sight during rush hour, this is something I almost NEVER saw anywhere else...because in those places, you had to worry that the driver was legally carrying a gun.<p>In NYC, of course, the driver could conceivably have a gun...but you know what, that is a very unlikely situation, because it is not worth carrying a gun in the event that you get pulled over for a traffic infraction. And so those who might commit a crime out of hotheadedness are significantly inconvenienced by gun control laws...reducing the chance that any hothead fight results in gunfire.<p>And in a city as tightly packed as NYC, that is not a non-trivial benefit. I haven't been in favor of gun control laws in any of the rural areas I've lived, but in NyC, I realize it's a different situation that requires different thinking on the laws.",1354336205

4856809,comment,4856207,4856530,14,0,mjn,,,"This is an interesting long-running debate in procedural generation more generally. There are a lot of approaches, hybrids between them, and orthogonal decisions, but two ends of one axis of what I'd call ""procedural faithfulness"" are:<p>1. Attempt to faithfully simulate an underlying process. An example: procedurally generate canyons by simulating water flow and erosion. Dwarf Fortress tries to take this one to its logical conclusion, doing things like simulating thousands of years of history in order to decide where to place things.<p>2. Produce an algorithm that mimics a desired result without necessarily using a process even close to what produced the original. Often this involves attempting to capture patterns in the original without attempting to capture <i>why</i> those particular patterns arose. Many grammar-based methods take this approach, such as the classic ""shape grammars"" used in architecture, as do data-mining approaches.<p>This book looks at something closer to #2 from the perspective of procedural faithfulness. But it's a variant that was particularly popular in early algorithmic art: pick an algorithm that has interesting outputs, tweak it, and see what you can do with the results. So in a sense it's closer to #1 in that its macro-properties are emergent, rather than being specifically optimized for (it's not doing things like solving for path reachability).<p>If generating a city, for example, you could attempt any of these approaches. You could build a little artificial agent society where you simulate agents going to work, having families, buying houses, etc., and their actions produce a city. Or, you could play with hand-coded city-generation algorithms that produce interesting patterns, and go with one. Or, you could choose specific targets or constraints (maybe culled from databases of real city geometry) and use constraint-solving or genetic algorithms or generative machine-learning algorithms to produce the desired results. Different pros and cons.<p>It's something I've been thinking a bit about lately, because I've been trying to understand the landscape of systems that claim to do ""automated game design"" [1]. Much of the work takes a simulation-based approach: tries to come up with a theory of what makes a game ""balanced"" or ""fun"", and optionally also simulates a broader theory of game design, playtesting, and revision. But another approach is to view it as crafting generative spaces of game variants, which is more of a theory of how game structure can vary than a theory of <i>why</i> it varies, and gives a different (not clearly better or worse) angle on the problem.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kmjn.org/notes/generating_mechanics_bibliography.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kmjn.org/notes/generating_mechanics_bibliography....</a>",1354335064

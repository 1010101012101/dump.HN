Maybe we're to be the agents of the destruction, or maybe we can predict the future. Whatever. The essential points are that we know ""if not X then destruction"", that building X will require collective allocation of resources, and that the model inhabitants are uncertain about this future.<p>Also, the world will be destroyed soon. Say within the lifetime of the majority of our model people, so that most of them can expect to see the end of the world. The world will be destroyed in a way that does not confirm widely held religious beliefs. In other words it should appear to them as a Bad Thing, not a Good Thing.<p>Ok, questions: how should the model people value some person's plan to build X to avoid disaster? What is the true value of X? Are there different reasonable answers, or only one? Should we prefer metrics that are more likely to cause X to be built, or is that irrelevant?",1279137542

1515746,comment,1511311,1515252,0,0,dkarl,,,"There's no graceful way to make the distinction in modern English, and the distinction isn't important to the phrase being translated.  Why go out of your way to preserve it, to the extent of using awkward or archaic language?<p>""Know yourself"" doesn't have the ring of authority and solemnity that ""Know thyself"" does, but when you think about <i>why</i> ""Know thyself"" sounds that way to an English speaker, it doesn't make any sense at all to exploit that connotation.  (That is, unless Socrates himself would have approved of exploiting religiously tinged language to bypass rational skepticism.  That doesn't sound like the Socrates I've heard about, but I must confess that I know Socrates mostly by reputation.)<p>Different languages make many different distinctions, and translations are inevitably lossy.  Translation would be an impossible job if translators didn't feel free to drop distinctions that, in their view, aren't essential to the meaning of the text.<p>For example, in a Spanish news article about a criminal's appearance in court, the gender of the criminal's lawyer might be evident, but if the lawyer is not mentioned by name, the lawyer's gender would probably not be evident in the English translation.  There's nothing wrong with that, unless there happens to be some special reason why the lawyer's gender is relevant to the story.",1279137162

Every new development project, even if it is small, will have hard problems to solve. You will have to apply your knowledge of algorithms and data-structures more often than you imagined. In contrast, a maintenance project may give you a hard and difficult to debug problem which finally turns out to be caused by the previous developer forgetting to compare all the 7 properties of an object in the equals method.

1515686,comment,1515387,1515387,0,0,dermidgen,,,"Wow, this question could have been written by me.<p>Here's what I've found.  Starting on a new career path is a crappy proposition.  Most of the trades that have been suggested do either require extensive training and preparation, or some degree of paying your dues (as with any industry).  However, what really killed it for me is that basically I would be doing contract work (we all know how that goes - ebbs and flows) for about 150% less than I do now.<p>Here's my current solution to this issue.  Change of working environment and the addition of a second job.  Boy am I busy NOW!<p>To change environments I decided to go solo contractor, get my 3g tethering setup on my iphone, get my laptop, and now I go as far out into the wilderness as possible while still getting 3g signal, and I work from the shade of a tree in nature.  I try to do that for at least 50%-60% of my work. It has helped tremendously!<p>I've also spent a great deal of my extra sports time brushing up on skills that I had thought would never be an actual part of my life - shooting.  This is something that doesn't require formalized instruction or training - although there is plenty of that available.  The additional benefit is that I can now instruct others how to properly, safely, and boldly handle a firearm - and to use it effectively.  This not only solidifies the knowledge I already have (teaching others is by FAR the best way to get something deeeeply rooted into you), but gives me an opportunity to be outside doing something physical, make money, and give back in an area where there is a DESPERATE need for quality instruction without ego (there is sooooo much ego in the shooting work it's sickening).<p>This particular path has actually relieved a tremendous amount of stress in my life and opened up opportunities and connections with people and communities that I never expected.  It's quickly becoming a secondary career path.  My new mission is to find a way to bring both worlds together - find a need in the market that fits a shooting developer ;) and fill it.<p>I'm currently a certified instructor of the C.A.R. System by SabreTactical <a href=""http://www.sabretactical.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sabretactical.com</a> and the civilian variant IPD Systems.<p>PM me - you're in my head.  lol  get outta my head get outta my head!!!",1279136222

There are a slew of other languages and frameworks out there that could be used.<p>PHP gives you the flexibility to create more complex projects without being pigeon-holed into one specific framework.  I noticed this with some of the newer languages (and frameworks) such as RoR and Django.  The higher the level you go, the more difficult it is to get around the built-in features that try to make it easier to develop an application.  PHP is at the perfect level for me.  Higher than say c, but lower than something like RoR.<p>Also, the c syntax makes it to move onto other languages.<p>It's also been around for 15 years, which means a plethora of support and examples.  The language itself may have some issues (naming convention, Unicode support, non-standard namespace convention), but it can still be used to create solid applications that scale well (if you know what you are doing).<p>Since PHP has been around longer, people really need to come up with reasons NOT to use it (and why I should be using new language X).

Like...er...HDMI. Upgraded functionality to something everyone already knows (cat5) is a much easier sell psychologically.<p>I don't think the brittleness is a big issue. Pro a/v techs often use heavy duty cat5 cables with rugged connectors (<a href=""http://www.amphenol-airlb.com/Rugged.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amphenol-airlb.com/Rugged.html</a> - this is the best supplier IMHO). Then, making cables just needs a supply of jacks and a crimping tool - neither is expensive, and being able to do field repairs or make additional cables is a lot better than some custom connector that can only be built in a factory. Finally, power and signal on the same cable is a huge win.<p>In the video world, it's very desirable to be able to quickly feed signal over varying distances in some new location you've never been into before and will only occupy for a few hours. HDMI cables are a pain, like all fiberoptic cables - very expensive, short runs, and they're so delicate that they need lots of structural shielding which makes the cable springy and hard to manage (which usually necessitates an extra pair of hands). Then, monitors and cameras need power, which means either annoying little adapters plus additional heavy power cables, or else heavy battery packs (which cost $$$).<p>If the component electronics for this standard are affordable and reliable (and I expect they will be, given similar existing products) then the pro video community will be all over this in short order - a breakout box that delivers 12v DC, has audio & video i/o, and hooks onto a belt will be a godsend for many people even if the camera and sound gear doesn't catch up for a few years. 100w is plenty of power for most requirements.<p>From what I see of the evaluation units (<a href=""http://www.valens-semi.com/products/5play-evaluation-kit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valens-semi.com/products/5play-evaluation-kit.asp...</a>) the technology should be easily deployable, and 'revolutionary' would not be too strong a word to use in this context.",1279134373

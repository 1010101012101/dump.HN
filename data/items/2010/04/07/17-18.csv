I think their role is overwhelming, and I say that in the post too.  My point is simply to consider the role of pedagogy (and contrast the pedagogies of non-mathematical subjects in high schools in the US and India) and wonder if that has a role to play in the fact that so many ""bright"" students in India end up being engineers and doctors.<p>Perhaps, there's also a relationship between the external factors (probability of getting a job, job prestige, etc.) in a developing country and the style of pedagogy in schools that cater to the middle class, although at this point, I can't really think of a mechanism that makes things the way they are.",1270661614

The person testing the bug shouldn't be the developer; QA is doing it.  If the fix involves several people and they need to add input, they can add in their comments in the bug tracking system.

The buzz at the meetup was all about twitter and Foursquare.<p>It's been about 6 months since I heard people at the H&F SV meetups be really excited about twitter.  And, while, we're starting to add features on <a href=""http://newsley.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://newsley.com</a> to include what people are tweeting about a specific stock ticker, that's not really the main impetus of our business.  It's more of a value add.<p>A lot more of the buzz that I hear around the Valley is moble apps.  iPhone, iPad, android, especially mobile Geo.  That's what the cool kids seem to be doing.  Any ideas on why that's different?",1270660013

9577836,comment,9574953,9577539,0,0,darkroasted,,,"<i>Why is that? Is it because of externally imposed social structure issues (the consequences of racism), or is it because of internal nature (blacks are less intelligent and moral than whites)?</i><p>Hypothesis #1: Blacks are the pawns in an ongoing civil war between the Red Tribe and the Blue Tribe of American whites. The blue tribe, the left, talks a big game about helping black people, but if you look at what they do, they try to pin all the blame for the plight of black people on lack of education and the racism of the Red Tribe. The blue tribe is mostly interested in using blacks as a voting bank, not on finding the true causes and fixing them. The fixes they do spout, such as education, provide massive wealth transfers to Blue tribe labor unions while doing nothing to fix the problems of broken families and crime. The Red Tribe cares mostly about containment. To the extent they want to fix the problem, it is by funneling money to their own political base, police unions and the prisons. &quot;Tough on crime&quot; attorney generals care a lot more about big drug busts and crack-downs on gangs than on the kind of beat policing that would prevent the crime in the first place. Note that this civil war has been ongoing for 200 years, and turned into a hot war a couple times, once in 1860, again in the late 1960&#x27;s.<p>Also, because ghetto blacks never evolved their own indigenous culture, what culture messaging they receive comes through the Blue Tribe institutions. The official story in these institutions is that everything good comes from the government. The story of U.S. history as told as government becoming more progressive, a great president is a president who made some new program to help people. This contrasts to my own upbringing. Growing up in a white suburb, most of what I learned about life came from watching my family and neighbors, where you had lots of crusty older guys serving as role models in how they built their own businesses, did work on their own homes every weekend, took care of their family, etc. I didn&#x27;t learn right or wrong from school, it came from my mom, family, and peers. School was anarcho-tyranny and Lord of the Flies, even in my wealthy suburb.<p>Thus in all, the Blue Tribe cultural messaging discourages the black communities from self-organizing to figure out their problems on their own. The Red Tribe policing also prevents this. Potentially, if gangs were allowed to fight it out without any interference, eventually one gang would win and they would set up their own government. But there is just enough policing to prevent that from happening. So the whole community is caught in a trap. Alternatively, the police could seek out the good guys in the ghetto, there are good guys, and deputize them as local officers, who could walk beats and police the street. But the Red Tribe police unions would likely hate this, as there is no way they could pay those officers union wages, it would be seen as taking away from union jobs.<p>Hypothesis #2: The genetic hypothesis. The evidence for this has been covered elsewhere, for example <a href=""https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/first-things-first-why-even-exist/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/09/13/first-thi...</a> and <a href=""https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/the-likelihood-of-genetic-group-differences-in-iq-the-black-white-gap-in-iq/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/10/07/the-likel...</a> and <a href=""https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-vice-tightens/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://liberalbiorealism.wordpress.com/2009/11/03/the-vice-...</a> and <a href=""https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-iq-f-a-q-f-r-b/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jaymans.wordpress.com/jaymans-race-inheritance-and-i...</a> and <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/features/2007/created_equal/liberalcreationism.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_natur...</a> For my own part, if you hold a &quot;preponderance of the evidence&quot; standard, then I would say there is more evidence on the side of there being significant genetic difference in average IQ. I avoided this conclusion for a long time, I did not want to believe it, but I think that avoiding the truth will only make it harder to deal with these problems. I do think that the lower average IQ this makes it harder for black ghetto populations to figure out how to build localized institutions to enforce rule of law, and it makes it harder for these ghetto populations to work around the dysfunctions of the broader political institutions. Also, making the problem worse, is that the most intelligent 20-30% of the black ghetto population escapes the ghetto and lives elsewhere. So the ghettos are continually stripped of the human capital needed to make their local institutions functional. For instance, I was reading on one site that the average IQ in the black ghettos of Baltimore is 75, which is stunningly low.<p>I don&#x27;t think that identifying the problem of &quot;lack of self-policing&quot; is blaming the victim, it is just identifying the proximate cause. I don&#x27;t think blame is constructive framing for fixing anything. My goal is simply to get the truth out there, and it will be up for people working locally to figure out fixes, based on the hard realities of the situation. I certainly don&#x27;t think that finger-wagging at black people saying &quot;you need to self police&quot; is going to fix anything. But we do need a sort of &quot;five why&#x27;s analysis&quot; for what has happened ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys</a> ), so that we can fix things. Too often in these debates as soon as you get to one cause that can be pinned on the other tribe, the analysis stops and the blaming begins.<p>There is a final dark implication to ponder, that neither tribe talks about. Many of these ghettos are actually in prime real estate. South-central LA and Oakland have wonderful climates. Brooklyn, Anacostia, etc, are highly proximate to lots of great jobs. If the crime problem was actually fixed, blacks would be pushed out of these neighborhoods by gentrification very quickly.<p>I don&#x27;t really have any great solutions myself. The red versus blue tribal war needs to end. The only way these problems can ever be fixed is at a local level, by people who care about the problem and who are close to the problem. Having outsiders moralize or use these issues to score political points just makes everything worse. But even then, a happy fix is unlikely.",1432143194

9577824,comment,9574408,9577023,0,0,AlyssaRowan,,,"Seconded. Group 14 (2048-bit, ≈112-bit workfactor) or another safe 2048-bit or greater prime (such as ffdhe2048, or ffdhe3072 @ ≈128-bit workfactor) will do fine for now. You don&#x27;t need to roll your own safe primes. As per the paper: &quot;When primes are of sufficient strength, there seems to be no disadvantage to reusing them.&quot;<p>The problem with reusing them is of course when they&#x27;re not strong enough, and so if an adversary can pop one, they can get a lot of traffic - and as I&#x27;ve said for a while and as the paper makes clear, 1024-bit and below are <i>definitely</i> not strong enough. Anything below 2048-bit would be a bit suspect at this point (which is precisely why the TLS Working Group rejected including any primes in the ffdhe draft smaller than that - even though a couple of people were arguing for them!).<p>If you&#x27;re still needing to use 1024-bit DH, DSA or RSA for anything at all, and you can&#x27;t use larger or switch to ECC for any reason, I feel you have a Big Problem looming you need to get to fixing. Custom DH groups will not buy you long enough time to ignore it - get a plan in place to replace it now. We thought 1024-bit was erring on the small side in the 1990s!<p>I concur that the NSA&#x27;s attack on VPN looks like an operational finite-field DH break - I didn&#x27;t realise that two-thirds of IKE out there would still negotiate Oakley 1 (768) and 2 (1024), but I suppose I didn&#x27;t account for IKE hardware! Ouch!<p>Their attacks on TLS are, though also passive, architected far more simply and more suggestive of an RC4 break to me as there seems to be no backend HPC needed - ciphertext goes in, plaintext comes out. Both are realistic attacks, I feel, but RC4 would have been far more common in TLS at the time than 1024-bit DHE, and although 1024-bit RSA would be present many likely sites would have been using 2048-bit, so naturally they&#x27;d go for the easiest attack available. (That gives us a loose upper bound for how hard it is to break RC4: easier than this!) I also don&#x27;t think the CRYPTO group at GCHQ would have described this as a &quot;surprising […] cryptologic advance&quot; from NSA, but just an (entirely-predictable) <i>computational</i> advance, and (again) lots of people in practice relying on crypto that really should have been phased out at least a decade ago. So there&#x27;s probably more to come on that front.<p>Best current practice: Forget DHE, use ECDHE with secp256r1 instead (≈128-bit workfactor, much faster, no index calculus). You can probably do that today with just about everything (except perhaps Java). It will be faster, and safer. And, we know of nothing <i>wrong</i> with NIST P-256 at this point, despite its murky origins.<p>Looking forward, Curve25519 (≈128-bit) and Ed448-Goldilocks (≈222-bit) are, of course, even better still as the algorithms are more foolproof and they are &quot;rigid&quot; with no doubts about where they come from (and in Curve25519&#x27;s case, it&#x27;s even faster still). CFRG is working on recommending those for TLS and wider standardisation. You can use 25519 in the latest versions of OpenSSH right now, and you should if you can.",1432143080

E.g., this passage from the Oz documentation[1]:<p>&quot;Oz 1, supports a fine-grained notion of concurrency where each statement can potentially be executed concurrently. This results in a fine-grained model similar to the actor model. A good exposition of the Oz 1 programming model is given in [Smo95]. Our experience using Oz 1 showed that this kind of model, while theoretically appealing, makes it very hard for the programmer to control the resources of his/her application. It is also very hard to debug programs and the object model becomes unnecessarily awkward.&quot;<p>For I/O in particular it is also difficult for the machine to know what is safe to do in parallel. For instance, two writes to the same file probably has to happen in order. What about writes to different files? What about HTTP requests?

So, in many cases, either or both the &quot;not being locked up...because they are black&quot; and the &quot;they are committing crimes&quot; part are in considerable doubt.<p>> By blaming the war on drugs we are also completely ignoring the other elephant in the room, and that is the massive breakdown in family structure that has occurred amongst the impoverished.<p>The selective targeting for higher penalties an higher prosecution rates for drugs predominantly used in the black community as part of the &quot;War on Drugs&quot; and the correspondingly higher rates of incarceration in that community resulting from it is a directly contributing factor to the &quot;massive breakdown in family structure&quot; in that community (and the war in drugs in general, and the incarceration resulting from it, is likewise a contributing factor to the breakdown in family structure among the impoverished outside of the black community.)<p>> Our &quot;war on poverty&quot; has, like the war on drugs, been a failure.<p>Arguably, &quot;like&quot; should be replaced with &quot;in large part due to&quot; in that sentence. The &quot;War on Drugs&quot; largely is a war on the poor. It directly opposes any &quot;war on poverty&quot; (though even as a <i>slogan</i>, much less any substance, the &quot;war on poverty&quot; was largely abandoned shortly after it was announced, and replaced by the War on Drugs.)",1432142341

</code></pre>
To validate a pair (M, T), we verify:<p><pre><code>   T = MAC(K, M)
</code></pre>
Ideally, the execution time in this verification is independent of T. But many languages use string-comparison algorithms that exit immediately on failure. If Eve can detect this difference with high granularity, she has an oracle telling her how many leading bytes of a guessed tag T&#x27; are valid:<p><pre><code>    O(M, T&#x27;) -> n
</code></pre>
She can use this to recover the first byte of a valid tag for M:<p><pre><code>    for k in [0, 255]:
        if O(M, k || 0000...) > 0:
            return k
</code></pre>
She can extend this to recover the second byte, the third, and so on. Eventually, Eve will recover T such that MAC(K, M) = T. In other words, Eve is able to forge an authentication tag T for an arbitrary message M.<p>What she won&#x27;t do is recover K. So while she can forge tags for arbitrary messages, each forgery will require a fresh, online interaction with the verifying party. She cannot work backwards from (M, T) to K.",1432141615

9577655,comment,9576864,9577548,0,0,brandur,,,"> Thanks for the article, very interesting.<p>Thanks!<p>> What we have implemented was a Python decorator to have the tasks actually fired after the function completion (thus after the transaction commit). In Go we achieve the same result in a more simple way using the defer statement. In my experience, all these solutions are local to the process that fires the task, so there is less risk of interaction with other process, easy to implement and more robust compared to other solution.<p>Oh yes, totally. I&#x27;ve seen this same pattern in Ruby before whereby a job enqueue is put on something like an ActiveRecord `after_commit` hook.<p>One (overly) pedantic observation is that this still leaves you with the possibility of having your transaction and data safely committed in your database, but with your job not enqueued if something happens to your process between the time of commit and time of enqueue. Admittedly though, this probably doesn&#x27;t happen all that often in real life.<p>Probably the best answer I have is that we take this approach for the sheer convenience. We can do things like this:<p><pre><code>  def create_user(email, password)
    User.transaction do
      user = User.new email: email
      user.set_password_hash(password)

      check_for_abuse!

      # make an account ID queue job to create record in billing system
      user.billing_account_id = uuid()
      async_create_account_in_billing_system(user)

      # queue job to send an e-mail invite
      async_send_invite_email(user)

      create_auditing_record

      ...    
    end
  end
</code></pre>
You can build out very explicit chains of actions that may enqueue jobs or call into other chains that may enqueue their own jobs and all the while never have to worry about any kind of ordering problem while working anything. There are no hidden callbacks anywhere, but you still get to keep perfect correctness:  if anything fails at any point, the whole system rolls back like it never happened.",1432141568

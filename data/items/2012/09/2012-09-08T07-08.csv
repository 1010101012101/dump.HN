You have never ""learned"" to program, you are ""learning.""<p>I am afraid your comment is even more mistaken. Even more it is discouraging in a really bad way. Read carefully and I'll explain. Even if your HN score is 10 times mine.<p>In my opinion you are creating a false dichotomy between having learned and learning. Someone who has just started to walk/bike etc has still learned to walk/bike. They are by no means near entering Olympics for the next few years but they have made their own life very much simpler and more enjoyable. (Father of small children here.)<p>Comments like yours are discouraging at least one specific subset of people from doing the one thing that can possibly help them increase their skills, namely use them. I even think that for most people even if they can learn a lot about coding by just reading, reading and immideately applying it is by far a quicker route.<p>Anecdata: I once told a 16 y.o. intern how to use basic perl and Visual Basic for Applications. After 14 days where he would run his scripts, check, check with his supervisor, fix the code, learn more perl and vba and so on he came back with a report that would have taken weeks to finish by hand. He is now on his last year on a Bachelor with Honors study and this was his first useful program. Still makes me happy.<p>(By the way, I also started coding at age 12. Having programmed for both $100+ million companies as well as startups I am not one of those struggeling to learn the basics. Anymore, that is : )",1347091165

There's a large chunk of the world that always read ""designer"" as ""graphic designer"". Mixed up with this is the problem that the various communities of practice are, I think, searching for a more common identity.<p>In the development world we have ""developers"" or ""engineers"" - which include all of:
* back-end coders
* front-end coders
* devops
* folk focussed on building automated tests
* folk focussed on tool development to support the rest of the team
* database experts
* etc.<p>... and we're also quite happy to have people be good at bits multiple categories and be<p>In the UX community we have:
* interaction designers
* graphic designers
* UI designers
* content strategists
* usability testers
* user researchers<p>And like the dev world there are people who are good a bits of multiple categories, but there isn't really a good general identity. As I said ""designer"" is often seen as just graphic design. UX Designer is a ghastly clumsy phrase, but at least it doesn't suffer that problem.",1347090731

While many charities address philosophical issues or try to change the public's mind about various issues, Planned Parenthood actually does something -- they offer young people reproductive choice, sometimes in places where no other choice, or even the idea of choice, exists. Many young women, whose lives are about to go off the rails, owe Planned Parenthood a debt of gratitude that they can compete their education.<p>I've been involved in many charitable activities over decades, but when I invested in a Planned Parenthood clinic in rural Oregon, I finally found out what ""charitable activity"" really means -- people regularly threatened my life.<p>When people call at midnight and threaten you with death, you realize you're making a difference.",1347090570

And what's even more difficult, you have to prove it to be fail-safe to the regulators.<p>That's not possible. It is not possible to prove a nontrivial program to be fail-safe, any more than it is possible to prove a nontrivial axiomatic system to be internally consistent -- and for the same reason: Gdel's Incompleteness Theorems.<p>The Turing Halting Problem, and Gdel's Incompleteness Theorems, are deeply connected.

4492525,comment,4483710,4491773,1,0,Silhouette,,,"No, PayPal is almost the opposite extreme: they do very little in the way of checking up-front, and that's why there can be problems later when their aggressive fraud checks kick in.<p>I'm not looking for anything so dramatic, just that merchant account providers should recognise that they are dealing with a separate legal entity. Identifying the key personnel is reasonable, and so is wanting to check them against databases of known fraudsters etc. Asking to see financial statements, business plans, projections, etc. is all reasonable too. So is requiring a cautious degree of funds retention until the trading patterns become clear is reasonable. I really don't have a problem with a merchant account provider wanting to know who they're dealing with and to have some confidence that the company is a viable business; that's only fair.<p>I'm simply arguing that putting members of the company on the hook personally is not fair. If you're going to have companies at all then you have to protect them against such arrangements by law or you've devalued the entire concept and undone whatever benefits you were hoping to achieve in terms of incentivising entrepreneurial behaviour in your economy.<p>For the record, I'd add demanding direct control of the company bank account as a red flag as well. Aside from the glaring potential for abuse or error by the merchant account provider (for which, by the way, the company directors will once again take the heat), this has obvious implications if the company ever fails: it allows the payment company to grab whatever it decides it's due <i>before</i> the usual legal mechanisms for dealing with corporate bankcrupty get a look in, for example. And what if there's more than one payment service involved? Do they get to race to see who can empty a company's bank account first if anything does go severely wrong?<p>IIRC the US has a concept of bankruptcy protection to isolate a company that's in trouble if they have a reasonable plan to extricate themselves rather than failing. Not running a business in the US, I don't know all the details, but it seems a reasonable premise. But what happens if that company has signed over direct access to its bank account to a merchant account provider, who is risk averse and doesn't like the chapter 11 filing?<p>The bottom line is that these are all worst-case, doomsday scenarios, and even if a company is going to fail, it's usually not going to fail out of the blue and to that extent. I think you're obsessing over a fraud risk at the expense of making it much harder for people to run honest companies. If the system is set up in such a paranoid way, it's hardly going to be surprising if legitimate entrepreneurs are put off starting up, obviously leaving a disprortionate number of fraudulent applicants.",1347089600

The thought process was that at least cents will be represented exactly.<p>Yes, that will work -- until you need to compute taxes, discounts, or any other quantity that involves amounts less than a penny during interim computations. Then you're back to square one.<p>> Things like currency exchange would still benefit from a proper decimal type though.<p>Yes, but binary floating-point doesn't really pose a problem if handled carefully. The classic solution is to store all amounts internally in double-precision floating-point and only display the rounded values -- never truncate the values to the nearest penny as student programmers tend to do.<p>In the system described above, that used in all major financial packages, amounts like 0.1 simply aren't an issue, and every number base has amounts it can't represent exactly.",1347089085

When upgrading control room to digital, you pretty much also need to upgrade the automation of the plant to be digital and qualifying it to be used in NPP is a real nightmare. In mainstream software markets you can always release bugfixes and add new features afterwards. In NPP your system must work the right way in every possible situation right from the start. I don't think, there are many software companies writing fail-safe programs of that size. And what's even more difficult, you have to prove it to be fail-safe to the regulators.",1347087635

Indeed, the majority of us are well behaved and it is likely a very small minority who mixes things up a bit.<p>Because of our differing personalities and backgrounds, it is natural and to be expected that conflicts will arise, especially since we are usually in discourse on evaluating someone elses work. Yet, we must improve on the way we treat each other.<p>The idea that we have to be forced (through stricter rules or programmatic restrictions) to behave more civil to each other, should be disappointing and embarrassing to each HNer. We cherish this forum for each others intellect and input, and we know that our fellow HNers make us better at what we do. We cannot afford to lose some brilliant minds (old and new members) because a few of us are rude to each other.<p>This post is a follow-up to the recent (and some not so recent) blogs and posts written about incivility on HN. here is one:http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4396747<p>Here are some small things we can do amongst ourselves to change HN for the better:<p> 1. Each one of us must make an effort to politely call out any uncivil commenter.<p> 2. If someone insults you, do not respond with a rude comeback; instead, notify the offender respectfully that we do not tolerate incivility on HN.<p> 3. If you have offended any of your HNer mates, send each person whom you have offended a small note, this would suffice: [HNerName], I might have offended you with a comment I made some time ago, I just want to say I am sorry.<p> 4. If you have been offended and you in turn have offended the offender in a fit of self-defense rage, you should also send the note above.<p> Note that it takes a confident person to apologize for a wrong, so if you lack the confidence in yourself or you find it too cowardly or improper to apologize for a wrong, albeit a seemingly small wrong, then write this instead: Good to see , [HNerName], or How is it going, [HNerName]? Thats it. Thats all it takes to makeup sometimes. With that brief comment, you could turn an enemy into a friend, or potentially a client, an employee, or even a cofounder.<p> 5. If we notice a first time poster on HN, we should welcome said poster and simultaneously notify him or her that civility on HN is of paramount importance, and that he or she must also make note of incivility by others and call out any offender, politely.<p>Due to HNers' differing cultures and first languages, things can get lost in translation, so here are some euphemistic alternatives to potentially coarse language:<p> Bad: That looks like a piece of shit (or any such similar comment)<p><pre><code>    Better: I would not do it that way, I personally would have...
</code></pre>
 Bad: You are any idiot... (and the like)<p><pre><code>    Better: If you do it this other way, you would find some major advantages...
</code></pre>
 Really Bad: Your are not smart enough...  (you know these offensive comments)<p><pre><code>    Better: You should try this book, ..., it will vastly improve your knowledge in...

</code></pre>
And I am confident there will be some brilliant ideas and recommendations to follow in the comments below.<p>If you agree or disagree on the proposal above, please comment below and help us to rectify this issue.",1347087627

I ended up playing Civ for 3 days straight, and my Christmas dinner was toast, 6 boiled eggs and peanuts... whatever I could rustle up quickly without taking too much time away from the game.",1347087602

If they wish to sell, they must do it soon. This is because the industries understanding of the valuations for acquisitions such as DoubleClick will correct. The multiples are too high.

The fifteen your old of today that you think should be able to pirate software has no choice but to download it in a ridiculously easy manner.<p>There's no turning back now, unless there's an international movement to start policing the internet which involves cutting off countries that have been declared piracy havens from the  rest of the internet. This, of course, contradicts the principles of the internet.<p>I'm too much of a moral relativist to think the Pirate Bay is evil. Stalin was evil. George W. Bush is evil. Making something people want (one click access to free information) is not evil. Laws are not inherently good and violating laws is not inherently evil. <p>I'll admit that it's not practical for all information to suddenly be free, but in the long run, information will be free. In the meanwhile, people like you and me get to argue about how free our information should be. This debate is part of the process of freeing our information.",1186183978

I'm not incredibly impressed by their process of finding talent.<p>Background: I provided the hiring guy with architecture diagrams of some pretty large scale systems that I had designed: database clusters with 1TB of RAM and 72TB of disk, 10GbE network, etc.  I not only designed, I also implemented these systems, so I'm a pretty senior architecture engineer with 18 years of solid UNIX/Linux, SAN storage, and networking experience.<p>Long story short, I missed a very basic question ""what does setting the sticky bit on a directory do?""  I blanked because I wasn't expecting to answer basic sysadmin questions, and hadn't honestly set the sticky bit on a directory for several years.<p>So, they sent me a nicely worded email that after careful consideration, we don't have a position that matches you, etc.<p>The hiring process at Google is really messed up.  I gather that the only qualifications they are really looking for are:<p>1.  Fresh college graduates that memorized man pages.\n2.  Willing to work 80 hour weeks.\n3.  Don't care about salary because we're not going to pay much.<p>I mean seriously, you don't turn down a senior architecture engineer with 18+ years of experience because he blanked on a stupid memorization question that can be googled in 10 seconds.",1268945913

Yelp says that there's a ""Chinese wall"" between the people selling ads on Yelp and the people managing reviews.  Former Yelp employees seem to vouch for this.  The people suing them don't seem to have any evidence that the ad-sellers are manipulating the reviews.  Furthermore, some of the people suing Yelp admit that they solicited reviews from happy customers, which Yelp considers a no-no (and they've made this clear in public).<p>The only thing the people suing Yelp seem to have going for them is that some of the positive reviews for their businesses (some of which were admittedly solicited) got removed not long after they declined to buy advertising on Yelp.  Yelp essentially says that this was a coincidence: Their automatic filters try to eliminate solicited (and vindictive) reviews, and the filters happened to do their thing shortly after these businesses were approached by Yelp's ad-sellers.  But there's really no solid evidence of causality.  Given the number of businesses covered by Yelp, you'd expect this sort of thing to happen occasionally.  Furthermore, there are a lot of businesses that _do_ buy ads that still have negative reviews on Yelp.  So.<p>Also, did anyone else think of PG's essay ""The Submarine"" when reading that Inc. article?  To me, it really seemed like the article was biased against Yelp, to the extent that I wondered whether some of the lawyers suing Yelp have hired a PR firm...",1268944366

He turned down invitations to interview at some rather prestigious tech companies and was happy to remain in his little kingdom. Most of the time he was fixing bugs, adding smallish new features, etc. - i. e. he was not doing cutting-edge stuff. But he had the freedom to improve the code base as a whole. So every time he had to fix a major bug he would do some refactoring that made the code better, not just for him but for the entire team, as this always involved tweaking the APIs he wrote for the team.

I knew I wanted to get into a startup but didn't know how to get in touch with one.<p>I asked HN if anyone knew startups in the NYC area, a few people responded. I emailed a few, I received a few responses. Most of them were unpaid, which I MIGHT have been able to do but I do need money to support myself so it would have been a few days at that internship and a few working a paying job. I felt like a lot of the offers were just a dude in some apartment in brooklyn hacking on a project that was calling himself a startup (again, ok, I'd do that) but the ideas were not that good. I won't list them here, but suffice to say it was weak.<p>Eventually I got in touch with Bug Labs, and over the course of a few weeks hounded the crap out of them until finally they relented and agreed to an interview. They were not looking for interns - I think there were about 8 people at the time and they had 1 round under their belt but that was it, and working out of the old del.icio.us office which was quite cramped at that point. I distinctly remember being asked ""So what can you do for us"" because they really didn't think an intern could be of help. I think they pictured me making coffee.<p>Anyway I convinced them somehow to start me a few hours and a few dollars, and go from there. It became clear that I could contribute pretty quickly and I went to full time and they paid me more what interns were getting paid elsewhere, and the whole thing worked out really well. I came back the next summer and there were 2 other interns. I came back last summer and there were enough interns to have an area in the new office called ""intern city"", which had 5 or 6 guys of various levels of commitment/pay/hours.<p>It was a great experience for me, vastly more responsibility than I would have gotten at a ""big"" company like the article mentions, and I think I helped Bug Labs a bit too. Not to mention the guys I was working with were some of the smartest people I've ever met, and I got to be in NYC every day. I would say it was one of the best decisions of my career to ""Ask HN"" that day.<p>Oh and now that I and the other interns have convinced them its worth having interns around (and you're in the NYC area) apply for one!: <a href=""http://www.buglabs.net/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buglabs.net/jobs</a><p>(edit: weird coincidence with the kschultz/kschults thing to these stories)",1268944129

Nokia haven't shipped a major OS release since the DSP port came out, so even if they were going to ship it and/or Fennec (I have no idea), they haven't had a chance to do so yet.  It's probably worth pointing out that the DSP port is not specific to the N900 or Maemo at all.  It targets the C64x+ DSP, which is part of the OMAP3 SoC.  The N900, Motorola Droid, and Palm Pre all ship an OMAP3 that includes the DSP.<p>FFmpeg has an independent decoder but for encoding it uses libtheora.  The FFmpeg decoder has traditionally been slower than libtheora and didn't implement all of the Theora spec.  It implemented VP3 plus the part of the spec that the Theora 1.0 (and earlier) encoders produced, but failed to decode spec-compatible output from the Theora 1.1 encoder (which libtheora 1.0's decoder handles just fine).

You must produce an actual, working prototype<p>Unless it's impossible to have such a prototype without a substantial capital investment that's incompatible with a small entity<p>> 2. If some period of time (say, 2 years) elapses during which you're not physically producing copies of the device for sale, you should lose the patent right and it becomes public domain<p>Maybe two years is too short if the invention needs more time to be put into production. Imagine you invent a deep space-propulsion device that only works in deep space - you may need a long time to test it in working conditions. All in all, it's a sensible idea.<p>> 3. Patents should be non-transferable. Companies should not be allowed to own patents, only inventors; the inventor can give license to a company to make his invention<p>That could make it difficult to sponsor research. Say I have a couple billion dollars in my budget and I would like to help you invent that deep-space propulsion system. Do you seriously expect me to allow you to own the invention after making it possible for you to test and build it?",1268942518

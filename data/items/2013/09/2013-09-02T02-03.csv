6313253,comment,6313147,6313147,23,0,greenyoda,,,"The article didn&#x27;t address the question of <i>why</i> AT&T has phone records going back so many years. I doubt that five year old data about a customer would be useful for marketing, considering that they have the most recent data. Nor is old data useful for billing once the time period for contesting a phone bill has elapsed. Network capacity planning could be done with anonymized or aggregated data. So it would seem that the only reason why they hang on to all this data is because the government asks them to, or because they can make money selling it to the government (or both).<p>Now, think about what adverse effects such old data could have on justice. For example, let&#x27;s say a friend of mine from school, who I spent a lot of time talking to on the phone a decade ago, decided this year to become a drug dealer. The government could start investigating me based on this stale data, despite not having any reasonable suspicion that I was involved in any crime.<p>I think that what we really need is a privacy-oriented phone company built on the model of DuckDuckGo, which doesn&#x27;t keep any data about customers beyond what&#x27;s necessary for billing purposes. But maybe the U.S. already has laws that would make such an ethical phone company illegal.",1378090780

I no longer listen to music (or podcasts, or whatever) on the move. I&#x27;m more present, less tuned out, and I&#x27;ve learned some things and had some spontaneous interactions that are worth more to me than listening to music I&#x27;ve already heard many times before. I like it. People complained about the reduction in engagement when the iPod rolled around and everyone suddenly had earplugs on full-time.

Unlike the music industry, the tv/film industry isn&#x27;t being crippled by piracy - in fact the tv/film industry only seems to be getting bigger.<p>Simply put, there is no motivation for DRM streaming and DRM still remains a way for studios to keep control on who and when is licensing their content. Talking to some media execs, I was surprised to learn the reason most DRM is implemented is because for some content deal, the contract stated (which was written 6-8 years ago), said the player must have DRM. Now that the content landscape is getting even more fierce (with networks like CBS cancelling service to TimeWarner) no one wants to risk renegotiating anything.<p>Now what motivation does Netflix have to remove their DRM? They want you on their platform, so they can collect your data. The next Netflix that even has a chance of running it legal will probably incorporate ads into their monthly pay product like Hulu does, which isn&#x27;t at all surprising considering a huge chunk of revenue for these guys comes from advertising.<p>I&#x27;m not hopeful about DRM-free streaming. The tv/film industry is much different from the music industry. From a consumer POV, the biggest difference is streaming wins over downloading. There is less of a demand for DRM free content because people simply aren&#x27;t looking to copy their mp3s to their iPod/Zune/MP3 Player of choice.

And it&#x27;s understood that the right to have somewhere to live is essential but you can&#x27;t leave the city and get to a piece of land, land is not produced anymore and it belongs to the rich, you can&#x27;t buy it, you can&#x27;t raise cattle or chicken and you can&#x27;t plant, so, you&#x27;ll die.<p>And then everything else comes after this. Also, lets be honest, the level of education you need to even start pondering this you can&#x27;t get either, because by then you&#x27;d already have had to have eaten and lived somewhere, and maybe you have bills and you can be arrested.. Not such a viable option. Then it&#x27;s also probably a big fallacy that people can really live off of welfare policy goods, I don&#x27;t know how it is in the USA, but here in Brazil I&#x27;m pretty sure what you get is barely enough for you not to live like a wild animal in middle of &#x27;modern civilization&#x27;",1378088124

It has an instruction to take/release a lock on a variable. However, there was no language level feature that exposed this directly; and the synchronized construct added try/catch blocks so that you released the lock in a different scope than you took out the lock. This was espesially annoying because I was working on a &#x27;decompiler&#x27; based on the idea of compiling JVM bytecode to Java source code. This meant that I basicly had to resort to pattern matching how javac compiles synchronized, so my solution was non generic.

You&#x27;ll be looking through the Doxygen documentation and perhaps even the C++ source at times to figure things out in Moai.

The drawbacks are limitations from the source being closed and in the past there were performance issues for Android/iOS, but I have not tried Corona lately so it may have improved in that area.<p>[1] <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/sylvanaar2/lua-for-idea/wiki/Home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/sylvanaar2/lua-for-idea/wiki/Home</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://studio.zerobrane.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://studio.zerobrane.com/</a>",1378087765

6313088,comment,6308610,6308865,1,0,furyofantares,,,"> I am saving lots of developers hours<p>I don&#x27;t see how this is really true.  You say an interview can use up 15-20 developer hours and in some percentage of the failure cases you are saving that (and hopefully not failing some percentage of the passing casses, btw.)<p>My point is that if a 1-hour screening by a single developer is effective, I can keep it in-house and save 14-19 developer hours where you&#x27;d be saving me 15-20.<p>I guess I am actually assuming you are only spending 1 hour with the candidate, you never say that above.  But my point is, unless you are uniquely good at interviewing, the amount of time you are putting into interviewing the candidate is the amount of the you are saving me.",1378087333

6313082,comment,6307219,6311630,2,0,ubernostrum,,,"Well, the classic example is XML + rules about character encoding. Suppose I send you an XHTML document, and I&#x27;m a good little XML citizen and in my XML prolog I mention that I&#x27;ve encoded the document UTF-8. And let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m also taking advantage of this -- there are some characters in this document that aren&#x27;t in ASCII.<p>So I send it to you over HTTP, and whatever you&#x27;re using on the other end -- web browser, scraper, whatever -- parses my XML and is happy. Right?<p>Well, that depends:<p>* If I sent that document to you over HTTP, with a Content-Type header of &quot;application/xhtml+xml; charset=utf-8&quot;, then it&#x27;s well-formed.<p>* If I sent it as &quot;text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;, then it&#x27;s well-formed.<p>* If I sent it as &quot;text/xml; charset=utf-8&quot;, then it&#x27;s well-formed.<p>* If I sent it as &quot;application/xhtml+xml&quot;, then it&#x27;s well-formed.<p>* If I sent it as &quot;text/xml&quot;, then FATAL ERROR: it&#x27;s not well-formed.<p>* If I sent it as &quot;text/html&quot;, then FATAL ERROR: it&#x27;s not well-formed.<p>Or, at least, that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s <i>supposed</i> to work when you take into account the relevant RFCs. This is the example I mentioned in my original comment, and as far back as 2004 the tools weren&#x27;t paying attention to this:<p><a href=""http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html</a><p>These are the kinds of scary corners you can get into with an &quot;every error is a fatal error&quot; model, where ignorance or apathy or a desire to make things work as expected ends up overriding the spec, and making you dependent on what are actually bugs in the system. Except if the bug ever gets fixed, instead of just having something not quite look right, suddenly everyone who&#x27;s using your data is spewing fatal errors and wondering why.<p>Meanwhile, look at things like Evan Goer&#x27;s &quot;XHTML 100&quot;:<p><a href=""http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/04/the_xhtml_100.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.goer.org/Journal/2003/04/the_xhtml_100.html</a><p>Where he took a sample of 119 sites which claimed to be XHTML, and found that only <i>one</i> managed to pass even a small set of simple tests.",1378087253

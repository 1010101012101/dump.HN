That&#x27;s precisely what they&#x27;re for.<p>Any abstraction can be &quot;magic&quot; to people who don&#x27;t find it appealing or useful. Go includes some of those abstractions and excludes others, like any language.

Self-defense is a powerful right, and I&#x27;d say it easily trumps a potentially infected person&#x27;s right to visit a cousin.<p>People are free to die for their beliefs, whether such beliefs are true or not. But they have no right to make other people die with them. If push comes to shove, better-informed villages will expel all infected persons (preferably into quarantine centers, not into the jungle), post armed guards at every entrance, and either isolate themselves or only admit visitors from villages that have enacted a similar policy.",1410749995

Also, the spike glycoproteins that mediate entry into new cells are themselves very fragile (a certain number of these come apart from HIV virions as they circulate, even with the full protection of the stable osmotic, pH and temperature conditions found in blood and lymph).<p>If these things are damaged (as they are when the virus is exposed to the atmosphere, or to enzymes in saliva), they&#x27;re rendered non-infectious. So many details would have to change about the cells the virus targets, and the way that it enters them that I can&#x27;t see how it would be the same virus, with the same pathogenic effect if it were somehow to become airborne.

I think the key to building a dashboard is to ask three questions:<p>1. How do you measure success? -- or -- How will you know that life is good? How do you know that the sky is falling?  \n2. If you see this number (something specified in #1) go above or below a certain value, what are you going to do? Anything?  \n3.

Push?!<p>1 tells you <i>what</i> to put on the dashboard, 2 tells you how to prioritize the information (something that&#x27;s important but not actionable will be something that can be found, but isn&#x27;t prominent or on display above-the-fold), and 3 tells you the form factor/latency that&#x27;s needed.<p>I&#x27;ve built a lot of dashboards over the years. Some have completely changed businesses. Some have languished in obscurity.

8316991,comment,8316230,8316430,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"While I believe that nothing is ever 100% secure, I do think it is possible to implement a large range of security layers that protect Infrastructure from all but the most sophisticated attackers (aka state/country funded). The unfortunate truth is that different organizations put different priorities on securing their Infrastructure; Some might be great. Some might be not so great. So in my opinion, it doesn&#x27;t matter if they have 1000 Engineers or 1 Engineer. If someone puts security higher on the priority list, then things will likely become more secure. The industry as a whole has always seemed to put security on the back-burner. SSL is a good example, released in 1996 (TLS in 1999), but not implemented as an industry best practice (aka standard) until about a decade later. When I watch this video of the Network Engineers (not Sysadmins) reacting to these slides, I get the feeling that security was not a priority. The huge red flag was the password (which was extremely weak, and obviously no two factor authentication), in conjunction with a poor design that would allow a customer enclave to gain access to the providers network (there should have been a DMZ and/or additional security controls). Another red flag; their reaction indicated that they would never have thought that someone would map out their Infrastructure (first slide was their Routing Topology, second was the Network Topology). So I&#x27;m guessing they are not security minded, since someone into security would have taken this into account when designing their infrastructure (aka, what data am I letting out of my network?), and expected this to happen. My summary; I see a bunch of Operations guys that got caught with their pants down (no offense intended, I&#x27;ve been there). There is a possibility that this could have been prevented with better policy, stricter policy enforcement, and better infrastructure design. It&#x27;s also possible there are 10 other poorly implemented aspects of their infrastructure, and if someone wanted to get in, they would. And I guess this is my point; Unless you make it a priority to secure your infrastructure, it probably won&#x27;t be secure.",1410747952

8316972,comment,8316093,8316780,3,0,robert_tweed,,,"WRT your point about alignment - there is certainly no guaranteed alignment in C, so if you have (double star[1]) where (sizeof double) is 8 there is no guarantee that your pointer is evenly divisible by 8.<p>Most compilers will correctly align something like an array of doubles, but if you have something like a struct with a char followed by a double, it&#x27;s unlikely that the compiler will add 7-bytes of padding to ensure that the double is aligned correctly.<p>It should not be possible to get two unaligned pointers if they are taken from the same array. However, there&#x27;s nothing to say that the pointers actually point to an array of doubles as the code assumes. As you rightly point out, there&#x27;s no guarantee the pointers are even into the same array.<p>To use the struct example again, you could have an array of structs with a total size 9 bytes and therefore, to correctly walk that array, you would need to go in increments of 9. However, by taking the address of just the double element within the struct (rather than the base address of the element itself) you have just performed a sort of &quot;type safe but really unsafe&quot; pointer conversion.<p>The code will now try to walk from point A to point B by adding 8 bytes each time (because it thinks (double star) is an array of doubles), but the elements are actually offset by 9 bytes each.<p>E.g.:<p><pre><code>  struct my_struct {\n    char confusticator;\n    double number;\n  }\n\n  my_struct my_array[10];\n\n  double* first = &my_array[0].number;  // base address\n  double* second = &my_array[1].number; // base address + 9 !\n</code></pre>\nThere&#x27;s no alignment issue with unions because if the above were a union rather than a struct then the total size would be 8 bytes (the size of the biggest element) and both elements would have an offset of 0. You&#x27;re probably thinking of &quot;safe&quot; unions from other languages that resemble structs but are tagged in some way to indicate which of the values is in use. C unions just lay the values over the top of each other, so you better not try to use the wrong one! Trying to prove correctness of anything involving C unions would be a challenge.<p>Incidentally, when I was first starting out with C years ago, I had a lot of problems with pointers (as everyone does). I learned a lot of defensive programming techniques, one of which is to never construct a loop where the termination expression is based on equality; instead use (x < y) because that way, if something happens like begin and end being reversed, the loop will always terminate immediately. It also mitigates the problem is differently aligned pointer comparisons.<p>This is one of the things that bothers me a about iterators in C++11. Fortunately iterators themselves are safe; it&#x27;s just that they encourage (and in fact, require) writing code in a way that is potentially unsafe.<p>[1] For &quot;star&quot; read an asterisk character.

In doing so, I recognized that I was regularly forced to write <i>worse code</i> in the pursuit of doing things idiomatically because I lacked the semantic richness of C++, let alone Scala. And this worse-is-better attitude of the Go community gives me a dim view of its future--and between its junk GC and its completely pedestrian semantic and syntactic propositions I already had a dim view of its present.<p>If you write reusable, future-facing code, generic types without the erasure of interface upcasting is <i>required</i>.

This would require certain people having the right to take deceased corpses and burying without regard for the family/tribal/religious requests/requirements etc.  This would at the very least be seen as impinging on the rights of the family, it would likely need armed support.  If these burial specialists were say American, they would NOT be deployed without American armed support.  Having American armed support (most likely the army) on the ground supporting people who are likely to be impinging on perceived rights will be viewed as trampling sovereignty.<p>Australia and the Netherlands had a similar issue with the downing of the Malaysian Airliner in Ukraine.  In this case, the Ukrainian government had to pass legislation to allow armed Australian and Dutch military to support inspectors.  They were just &#x27;inspecting&#x27;, not creating forced closures of specific areas, forcing burials, witholding care, etc all under significant armed guards.<p>The present situation on the ground (and the lack of 3rd party government level interaction) is largely a result of weak leadership by the UN.  The better question is why the UN hasn&#x27;t taken ownership of the outbreak?",1410746918

For example, the 1962 budget of $107B would be $884B in 2014 dollars (using CPI) but the 2014 budget is $3650B, which exceeds the real 1962 GDP.",1410746909

But honestly, I expected higher quality from an original Apple product.<p>Just to add to the cringe factor, this happened on the toilet power outlet. Gladly, no one was harmed, despite the proximity the fingers to the actual short circuit as you can see on one of the photos. Also note that the mains pins are not damaged: the actual burst was on the USB side: who knows what transient went through that USB cable and into the user&#x27;s hand.<p>If you&#x27;ve played with electronic circuits, you know carbon is a great conductor of electricity. Once a surface is carbonized, it spreads the short circuit around. The USB jack on this charger is now carbonized and should be considered electrically in contact with the mains pins.<p>Be very careful with <i>any</i> device charger. Never use your phone while it charges and never use another device while they&#x27;re both charging as it may form a circuit. Just because it is 5 Volts USB it does not make it safe. There is a power line just 3 milimeters away from the USB jack inside this enclosure.<p>These switch-mode chargers are getting smaller and smaller and the physical shielding between 220VAC mains and the trusted USB output is literally just millimeters away. Distance means safety in electricity, and as great as these little charges look, I think safety&#x27;s being compromised for aesthetics here.<p>Be extra careful with any charger, <i>including</i> original brand name chargers.",1410746895

When I&#x27;m depressed I&#x27;m essentially bed-ridden.<p>I guess I took dangerous risks, depending on who you talk to. :)  I was never suicidal or homicidal, but I definitely did things that were out of character and scary to people outside.  One of the most interesting things is that I remember everything and it all seemed &#x27;rational&#x27; at the time.  Not rational per the normal definition of rational, but following my line of reasoning everything made sense.  I don&#x27;t want to go into too much details online as it wouldn&#x27;t take Sherlock Holmes to figure out who I am.  As it is you can google stalk me and eventually figure out my story.  Regardless it isn&#x27;t that interesting.<p>The threat part is that 1/5 people with bipolar die of suicide w/ 25% to 50% attempting.  That is so, so scary.  I was deeply affected by the passing of Robin Williams for that reason.  That&#x27;s almost always on the depression side.<p>For me, my mania was just ... extra happy ... going right up into the mystical amazement with life, the universe and everything that people typically associate with psychedelics, etc. 14 days into a hospital stay (my longest was 17 I think) that happy go lucky feeling sleeping ~1-3 hours max on heavy sedation becomes... much more agitated and frustrated.<p>Not attempting to edit this post for clarity, but yeah, that&#x27;s a rough sketch of my situation.  It&#x27;s been 6 years since I was last hospitalized (I had my friends take me in), but I&#x27;d say the feeling coming on is like an electric charge of infinite energy reverberating from the base of my skull.  Sounds awesome in theory, but it doesn&#x27;t convert to tangible output when the smoke clears.  I could write on and on about these experiences, but so can many others... /r/bipolarreddit and /r/bipolar are some spaces where people let loose on their experiences.",1410746692

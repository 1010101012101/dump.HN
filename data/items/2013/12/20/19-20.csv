People have made a social network for almost everything, and very few of them, if any, have gained any traction.<p>As sharemywin[1] said, you might be able to get a fair number of users; however, the problem would be with monetizing those users.  According to [2], you will make very little money with advertisements.  (I&#x27;m assuming this project is for the money; if not, you can safely ignore this whole post.)  I doubt that there would be very many people who would pay for any social network, so it would be difficult to make any money off it.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6942207\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6942207</a><p>[2]: <a href=\"http://blog.startupprofessionals.com/2012/03/website-ads-are-not-revenue-stream-for.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://blog.startupprofessionals.com/2012/03/website-ads-are...</a>",1387569582

Offering up misleading terms that do not convey a sense of their meaning is <i>much worse</i> than a word that is unfamiliar.<p>>My point isn&#x27;t really specifically about monoids; they&#x27;re just an example of what often goes on in Haskell, which is that people put theory before practicality and mathematical (and hence often esoteric) definitions before practical, real-world definitions.<p>But it isn&#x27;t an example of that.  It is quite bizarre to see people insist that this goes on, and give examples that do not support that claim, while being fully convinced in their proof.<p>>As it turns out, I&#x27;m not one of those people; I love the mathematical side of Haskell and I love that I&#x27;ve learned what a Monoid is and developed an interest in type theory, category theory and all kinds of other things. But not everyone is like that, and that&#x27;s the point I&#x27;m making.<p>You don&#x27;t need to be like that, that is the point we&#x27;re making.  I am not a math person.  I am not a CS person.  I am a high school drop out who taught himself to code in PHP and C.  I learned haskell just fine.  I learned monoids and functors and monads just fine.

You&#x27;re practically immune against any data theft at the place where you&#x27;re purchasing.\nNow, of course the problem only shifted as you have to guard your private keys now, but that&#x27;s more or less a question of tooling and usability of proper BTC clients (which hopefully come up in the future).

In fact, the fact that monoids are really so simple is kind of my point. In almost any other language, were such a thing to exist, monoids would not be called monoids but by some descriptive term which conveyed an intuitive sense of their meaning and use; it would be the purview of the mathematically inclined to write articles explaining how &quot;actually, what we call the Joinable type class is known in abstract algebra as a Monoid, and its use extends beyond just joining things; for example...&quot;<p>My point isn&#x27;t really specifically about monoids; they&#x27;re just an example of what often goes on in Haskell, which is that people put theory before practicality and mathematical (and hence often esoteric) definitions before practical, real-world definitions. Like I&#x27;ve said a few times, this isn&#x27;t incorrect at all. Nor is it surprising given Haskell&#x27;s origins, nor is it without purpose since it deepens your understanding of what&#x27;s going on in the language. It&#x27;s just a simple fact that the mathematical jargon is a turn-off to newcomers and those who don&#x27;t feel they want to be forced to learn math while they&#x27;re programming, or might think they&#x27;re incapable of doing so.<p>As it turns out, I&#x27;m not one of those people; I love the mathematical side of Haskell and I love that I&#x27;ve learned what a Monoid is and developed an interest in type theory, category theory and all kinds of other things.

I tell my bank whom to give money and how much.  Not my credit card.  Not my mortgage company.  Definitely not my gym.*  Nobody.  Never.<p>Therefore I never used debit cards.  Wells Fargo kept sending me debit cards when my ATM card expired.  I changed banks.

If I disagree with my credit card company, I can pay what I deem correct and cancel my card.  They can see me in court about the remaining balance, if they think they can win.  I am whole.  I still have my money in the bank account.  It is approximately never going to be a problem, because the credit card companies understand the score.  They have a strong incentive to play fair with an honest credit card holder.<p>Second of all, the moment the bank/credit card company thinks something really fishy is going on, you are screwed.  You know how you said you were wondering about those security questions and whether you would recognize the voice?  Think carefully.  If the bank suspects your nephew who stayed the weekend last month or a roommate or an ex-SO are directly involved, it all becomes your problem.  The bank will not restore any funds to your account.  The local police will laugh at you.  And now you see the problem.  The fact of your emptied bank account will not be changed, and those promises you were banking on are worthless.  (Have money to hire a lawyer?  That one is lose-lose.)<p>* Private gyms love to get bill your bank account and be authorized for automatic payment.  The thing most people do not realize is most banks consider this to be completely and totally your problem now.  If you cancel your gym membership, and the gym makes a &quot;mistake&quot; and keeps billing you, the bank will not help you.

Where I get concerned is where do we define the raw data?<p>For my thesis, I measured the Paterson function for a series of colloids.  I can imagine other scientists finding this useful and I&#x27;d be happy to submit it.  However, it&#x27;s not the raw data.  What I actually measured is the polarization of a neutron beam, which I then mathematically converted into the Patterson function.  So I should probably submit the neutron polarization I measured, so that other scientists can check my transformation.  Except that I can&#x27;t directly measure the polarization - all I really measure are neutron counts versus wavelength for two different spin states, so that must be my raw data.  But those counts versus wavelengths are really a histogram of time coded neutron events.  And those time coded neutron events are really just voltage spikes out of a signal amplifier and a high speed clock.<p>If a colleague sent me her voltage spikes, I&#x27;d I&#x27;d assume she was an idiot and never talk to her again.  Yet, I&#x27;ve also see experiments fail because of problems on each of these abstraction layers.  The discriminator windows were set improperly, so the voltage spikes didn&#x27;t correspond to real neutron events.  The detector&#x27;s position had changed, so the time coded neutron events didn&#x27;t correspond to the neutron wavelengths in the histogram.  A magnetic field was pointed in the wrong direction, so the neutron histograms didn&#x27;t give the real polarization.  There was a flaw in the polarization analyzer, so the neutron polarization didn&#x27;t give the true Patterson function.  And all of this is assuming that my samples were prepared properly.<p>I&#x27;ve seen all of these problems occur and worked my way around them.  However, I could only work my way around the problem because I had enough context to knew what was going wrong.  The deeper you head down the raw data chain, the more context you lose and the easier it becomes to make the wrong assumptions.  I know that I have one data set that provides pretty damn clear evidence that we violated the conservation of energy.  Obviously we didn&#x27;t, but looking at the data won&#x27;t tell you that unless you have information on the capacitance of the electrical interconnects in our power supplies on that particular day.<p>Research should be verifiable and reproducible.  However, an order of magnitude in verifiability isn&#x27;t as useful as an incremental increase in reproducibility.  I&#x27;d be happy to let every person on earth examine every layer of my data procedure to see if I&#x27;ve made any mistakes, but even I won&#x27;t fully trust my results until someone repeats the experiment.",1387567573

But, somewhere, as the stakes get higher, and the abstractions for the entity that &quot;owns&quot; the property (and who is responsible for what happens on that property, such as pollution, violence, etc.) becomes more diffuse, there is useful discussion to be had about whether that is legitimate private property or not.<p>I believe it is a stretch to say that an entity as diffuse as the United States (or any nation state) should be able to prevent billions of people from traveling freely from Mexico to Canada.<p>In short, I think &quot;private property&quot; is a good and useful fiction that we can probably all agree on, when we are speaking of individual humans who live and work on a piece of property. When you begin to make up fictional entities to &quot;own&quot; the property, I am less confident of the rightness of the theory.",1387567533

Given the disturbing unrestrained scope of US spying its reasonable to start with the assumption that the US has stolen any information that exists and used it to promote itself at the expense of even its allies. Problem is, when the likes of the NSA boldly claim to be able to access literally anything, anywhere, we must assume that all information and data are compromised. Doing anything different would be negligence.<p>Now the USA is in the same position Iraq was prior to the illegal invasion. It now has to prove a negative. Here is why:<p>Iraq was accused by the US and its lap dogs of having WMD (which incidentally was redefined to stitch up Iraq. Prior, WMD was understood to mean nukes. It got re-defined to mean bio and chem), and was expected to prove that it did not have them, or face the consequences. It failed in US eyes, and the US responded by killing many thousands of Iraq&#x27;s people in its OTT invasion of &quot;shock and awe&quot;. This was impossible as it is impossible to prove a negative. Iraq could not win in any way. Now, I think, the rest of the world, including its allies, would be reasonable in suspecting the US of having anything it likes in data terms, and must now prove it has not in order to regain any level of confidence. The US has to prove that it has not literally stolen money, IP, and business form non US companies by using stolen data to its advantage. The US has been stinging in its fines for banks acting illegally and defrauding government and public, acting like a moral god. Well, the same standards must apply to the US. If the US cannot prove its innocence, the rest of the world has every right to act in response. Unfair, and very difficult, but the US did set that standard. Like Iraq, the US must now some how prove its innocence. Or admit to its wrong doing.<p>The UK had no defence here either. We conspired in this. And I as a UK voter would like to know what we got out of it. Or did the US steal our information too? I wonder what Aussies and Kiwis think. Are we willing partners who knew what was really going on, and getting something valuable out of it, or were we all duped by the Americans?<p>Also, given the fact that the NSA is government organisation, it could be argued that what the US has engaged in is literally an act of war. There for its reasonable for countries like Germany, or regions like the EU, to investigate the US and if found guilty, demand reparations.<p>IMHO, its getting close to cards on table time, or the US get treated like an outcast.<p>Or, do we do what we always do, and ignore it?<p>I say it time to take a stand.

That&#x27;s less than 8 litres, including the PSU.<p>Last time I looked into this was in Spring, so maybe things have improved since then. Specific suggestions welcome.",1387566236

So, what you&#x27;d like is something like NATURAL JOIN that instead of using matching column <i>names</i> to infer join conditions it would use declared FK relations. That would be convenient -- but possible complicated by the possibility of multiple different FKs from one table to another (though the syntax could involve specifying the FK rather than the target table, which would solve that.)<p>e.g., if you had<p><pre><code>  CREATE TABLE emp (\n    emp_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    manager_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES emp JOIN AS manager,\n    hr_rep_id INTEGER FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES emp JOIN AS hr_rep,\n    name VARCHAR(50),\n    ...\n  );\n</code></pre>\nYou could do something like:<p><pre><code>  SELECT emp.name AS &quot;Employee&quot;, manager.name AS &quot;Manager&quot;\n  FROM emp\n  NAMED JOIN emp.manager;</code></pre>",1387566069

Neuroplasticity, at least in my interpretation, says that there is an observable feedback loop between the biological structure of our brain and our thoughts/feelings/actions, ie. our &quot;mind&quot;. If someone with characteristic of psychopathy, or any mental disorder labelled as incurable for that matter, consciously decides that he/she want to change his/her behavioural patterns then theoretically it is possible. Now, in a way all I did was rephrase my question into how conscious are we regarding our behaviour? Conscious enough to change it? :)",1387566038

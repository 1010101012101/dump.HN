28273,comment,28235,28248,0,0,ekzept,,,"yeah, like while i admit it's possible, why would businesses necessarily gravitate to a platform which has the image of being for teen and young adolescent dating?  <p>i know they're not free (as in beer), but there have been networks like this around for a while, and they have not become business platforms, even if they are ""more serious"".  i'm thinking of linkedin.com.<p>i'm not trying to scrap, merely to understand why people think this, rather than believe such notions are matters of early -- and justified -- enthusiasm.",1181882923

Facebook is first to the market with an open and technical robust combination of an API and distribution network but don't bet on it being the last.<p>I'm sure the ""OG's"" of the platform wars, Apple and Microsoft, have plans and Google is almost certainly working on something.<p>There's a reason Google and Microsoft haven't bought facebook, and it's not just because Facebook's price is too high.

Other times a change of market is as difficult as getting a new offer.  <p>The point I wanted to focus on in the post is companies who develop specific offers for specific markets.  I work with a number of companies who have great offers, wonderful meetings, and no sales.  Many times this is a result of having built something that's interesting, but isn't valued by the end user.  I especially see this in the area of expert services - services designed to ""fix"" problems that aren't measured or monitored by the target audience.",1181880391

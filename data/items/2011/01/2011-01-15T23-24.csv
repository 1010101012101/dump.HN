Next to that I am also working for a (european) Social Network site. Right now I am busy implementing implemented a system to filter spam for them. We were also discussing if we should make use of a company which implements a general propose spam filter for websites. But we think that by making use of the information that we have on our site and that are specific to us, we could improve the system a lot. I was thinking, that a lot of other sites could benefit from using machine learning, but that the field can be really confusing at first, with all the different algorithms and methods.<p>So my idea was to start a general propose Machine Learning service. The service would not require the user to have any knowledge of Artificial Intelligence whatsoever. You just upload your dataset and you are good to go. You can image how big of a disappointment is was when it turned out that someone at Google already had the same idea. I am have not been able to try their Data Prediction API yet, as it’s for US customers only at the moment. I think though that there is still enough room to do something differently then they do. For example allow different types of data (say images) or provide better customer service.<p>So my question to you guys is: Are there any of you who would be interested in such a service?  And if so what is your application? Judging from the comments here there were quite some people who enrolled in the Google API beta. Did you just do so, because it’s Google (e.g. to compare it to your own implementations)? Are there maybe people here who would like to do something that is not possible in Google API ?",1295135293

And we have inter-H/W duplication.  ZFS is self healing and makes management easy. Additionally we periodically compare the integrity of the user's AES-256 CTR encrypted data against the database records and make corrections if necessary. From our customer's and white label provider's view, it just works.

This just about sums it up. Many indie developers are harnessing potential new game genres. They're finding low-budget ways to create addictive games with a high chance of becoming viral. They're finding classic ideas to expand on and platforms to build off of. Big game publishers are failing to do this. They'll spend tons of money, yet lack the innovation to break through in these new areas of the market.",1295133018

In the beginning, our prototype machines used them to squeeze as many drives into a single machine as possible.  They have unusually low tolerance for electrical interference and make it possible for one badly malfunctioning drive to take an entire array offline until manually serviced. We've seen occasions where just touching a cable attached to a port multiplier caused the Linux kernel to emit ""dazed and confused"" NMI events.

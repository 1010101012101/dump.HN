Yes, there are loads of problems with the current cable TV distribution model.  The fact that it's an all-you-can-eat subscription isn't one of them.",1237611293

After this alarm, I start thinking and worrying about what I need to do. When the real alarm sounds I'm ready to jump out of bed.<p>* I don't use the bathroom in the morning when I'm sleepy. A full bladder helps me stay awake.<p>* I nap whenever I can't work.<p>* Also, drink some water before you go to bed and don't use the bathroom, this will help you wake up in the morning.",1237609809

But that's how he's feeling. It's like he shipped a car with a bad transmission that died, so he feels like he should replace it for free.",1237609304
525940,comment,525822,525822,0,0,makecheck,,,"Bugs will always be there; but you can maintain credibility in a few ways.  One, by showing that you do have solid tests (sounds like you do).  Two, by being frank with customers from the very beginning, about the imperfections of software.  And three, by showing haste, within reason, to fix any problems that are discovered, to respect customers' time and investments.<p>Still, the owner of a software project cannot be naive.  He or she must be reasonably aware of the sources of the various bugs, and deal with any patterns that are forming.  For instance, maybe one developer is responsible for the vast majority of problems.  Not all developers are good; in fact, many are quite bad, and don't belong anywhere near the code they're currently maintaining.",1237609104

He mentioned that he's not an early riser in the book ""Founders at Work"".<p>When searching more on the subject, I found this interesting text:<p>""This sort of smugness is prevalent among morning people, who count among their ranks Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, nearly every American president, and even Jesus. (See Mark 1:35: ""And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there prayed."") Night people are stuck with psychopaths like Adolf Hitler and Juan Arreola, the guy in Pennsylvania who nearly killed his girlfriend's 2-year-old last year, explaining to a judge, ""I'm not a morning person."""" <a href=""http://friendfeed.com/e/cc0e9eb4-39ff-11dd-9d6f-003048343a40/Can-a-night-owl-become-a-morning-person-A-Slate/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://friendfeed.com/e/cc0e9eb4-39ff-11dd-9d6f-003048343a40...</a>",1237609046

Be that as it may be, the alternative is currently dragging customers kicking and screaming to pay you exorbitant cable fees.<p>Is it any surprise that free, cheaper alternatives like iTunes, Hulu, et al, are taking off?<p>Maybe a la carte isn't the answer, but neither is cable bills and $70 a month subscriptions. The mere existence and <i>massive popularity</i> of other models (unprofitable as they may be) represent a very dissatisfied customer base.<p>My guess is that the costs of production will scale down to meet the new revenue reality of a la carte programming, instead of the other way around.",1237608797

Or possibly he's referring to people who watch sports and they don't mind paying for WNBA in order to see NFL games.",1237608514

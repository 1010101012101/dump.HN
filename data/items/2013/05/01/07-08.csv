Simple you say, just convert using your calculator: 150 [degrees] = 2.35619449019 [rad].<p>However On an exam/homework you would lose marks for this answer since it is not given ""the right way"" (as a fraction of pi). Using this app you can find out that  2.35619449019 [rad] = (3*pi)/4 [rad] and get all points.<p>Cool.",1367395058

These people tend to like MLs, Haskell, OCaml, F#. The ""mathematical beauty of perfect code"" is their ideal and favorite metaphor. <i>And I think they are right that teaching a Lisp to a beginner pushes ones mind away from ""what is"" oriented programming.</i><p>- the <i>Schemers</i>: the thinking in terms of ""what transformations to apply to something (it doesn't matter what ""something"" actually ""is"") to get something else or somewhere else"" programmer: these people like to be able to transform everything, including code itself, they like homoiconicity or macros in general, they prefer thinking in terms of ""how to compose/cahin transofrmations"" instead of types, they tend either no know or not value category theory too much and they are ok with seeing code as an ""organic entity"" that can't always be reasoned about. These people tend to like Lisps, Smalltalk and dynamic languages. The ""programming as magick"", in the sense of ""controlling the spirits (processes) inside computers"" is their favorite metaphor. They also like to maintain a playful mood and their ""it's ok that paying customers get shafted every now and then"" may have had a reason for businesses' dislike for ""schemer"" types and ""schemer"" realted technologies. As an offside paradox, some ""schemers"" tend to also like OOP, though they understand it should not be overused (I consider Alan Kay, usually mentiones as the father of OOP to be a ""schemer""). <i>I think that exposing a young learner to Lisp pushes one mind towards this direction, and this is why I love SICP. If you are a competent engineer you surely have a serious amount of math knowledge, so you can easily switch your mind to what-is/math mode and see the mathematical beauty when there is one to be seen, but most ""mathematician-programmers"" never seem to be able to love this ""ruleless organic beauty"" of the ""schemer way"".</i><p>I consider myself a ""schemer"" and I am biased to this side, but I understand and appreciate the value and arguments of the other - I'd rather fly in a plane with the control systems coded by a ""mathematician-programmer"" than by a ""schemer"" like me :)",1367394455

In exchange for a $39 billion merger, AT&T would have had to agree to a slew of new regulations, according to an idea Mr. Wheeler laid out at the time on his personal blog.""<p>If you dig into said personal blog, you can find the following article [1], where Mr. Wheeler summarizes his reasoning:<p>""Now we have the perverse situation where a government win means less regulation while a victory for the corporate interest opens the door to more.""<p>It is clear through his explanation that his approval was meant only as leverage for harsher regulations on the duopoly of wireless TelCos. That is a pretty solid indicator of where his allegiance lies. Likewise, if you meander around his blog, you'll see lots of musings in favor of Net Neutrality.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.mobilemusings.net/2011/09/awaiting-final-aria.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mobilemusings.net/2011/09/awaiting-final-aria.htm...</a>",1367393514
5636907,comment,5634992,5636596,18,0,jjcm,,,"Image formats have come a long way. I think the author wants an image format that can replace .psd in a sensible way. TIFF sadly cannot do that. While it can contain layered raster data, it lacks a lot of other capabilities. The author explicitly mentions vector layers, but if you want parity with .PSD you're looking at also having to support adjustment layers (hue/curves/levels/etc), blending modes, opacity/fill, raster masks, clipping masks, vector masks, locks, annotations, guides, grids, gradients, tags, text, comps, channels, and countless other things I can't even think to list (I wont even dive into smart objects). Keep in mind that's just the layer data, there's tons of other metadata in the format as well. It is a behemoth of a file format, and the years of backwards compatibility inside of it have multiplied that complexity to levels of insanity. I have .psd files that if I enable backwards compatibility when saving will increase the file size by half a gig. Granted those are enormous source files to begin with, but with higher def screens on the horizon file sizes are increasing dramatically. Having something more sensible than .PSD is something we're going to have to deal with sooner or later.",1367393401

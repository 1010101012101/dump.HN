Perhaps he imagined faster and more catastrophic dynamics, but inflation-adjusted Oil has been going up since 1998 [0].  If you had taken his advice and invested in oil futures in 2009, you could have become rather wealthy :)<p>Of course, there have been impressive price fluctuation (One happening right now). But it&#x27;s kind of expected in a highly complex system where technology, politics and financial crises interact in rather unpredictable ways.  On average, I still think the trend is UP (and the &quot;fracking miracle&quot; will be a short lived spike).  Peak Oil will happen (but predicting the date or dynamics inside a 20 year range is just as hard as predicting the timing and depth of a financial crisis).<p>[0] <a href=""http://inflationdata.com/articles/charts/inflation-adjusted-oil-prices-chart/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://inflationdata.com/articles/charts/inflation-adjusted-...</a>",1442231701

(i.e. please give me a plausible answer.)  It seems absolutely rampant there, people are literally - no exaggeration - murdered there.<p>(Obviously the reason for a throwaway account is because I don&#x27;t want to associate even two steps removed with violence in Mexico as well as, for example, the knee-jerk downvoting.)<p>Secondly, did you click the video?  (I link a specific spot.)  It&#x27;s hard to judge due to the distance and the fisheye distortion, but how far do you think those two ATM&#x27;s are?  Why do you think an iPhone won&#x27;t connect with them? (Even from much closer)?  If the signal is weak, as opposed to being in the gadgetry next to him, then why do both bluetooth connections show up instantly, as opposed to one after the other, given the huge distance?<p>I now realize he has a large established reputation - though I don&#x27;t have time to review all of his past writing.  It&#x27;s too much to review it all.<p>I would like to know why he can pick up a weak bluetooth transmitter from deep inside an ATM and under a massively attenuating circuit board, from far outside the nominal bluetooth range - which are figures for a purpose-built transmission enclosure, not being hidden under a circuit board, and then put inside an ATM.  It simply does not seem plausible to me, and I would like an answer.  I&#x27;ve worked a little bit with wireless equipment (not much) and the video does not seem realistic to me.<p>Further: bBlatantly exposing a well-funded mexican crime syndicate also does not seem in-character for anyone.  What makes this guy so immune?  Why are there no steps whatsoever to protect his identity, even while in Mexico?  He reports a meeting with 6 employee (no photos included, including after blurring their faces) any one of whom could have reported his meddling to an associated syndicate, before his stay was even over.  Wasn&#x27;t he scared?<p>These are specific objections I have, and I&#x27;m sorry I don&#x27;t have time to review his entire reputation and history; Lance Armstrong had never once tested positive for PED&#x27;s while winning 7 Tour De France titles and having a good claim to being possibly the most-tested athlete on Earth;  Bernie Madoff had been the Chairman - literally the <i>Chairman</i> - of the NASDAQ.  Yes, the whole stock exchange.   He also had an operation going back 30 years, was a preeminent community member and managed the endowments of several charities.<p>So please don&#x27;t appeal to authority, and instead answer my two specific questions.  Also, since his exposure, anyone found such a transmitter themselves?<p>I find the technical facts he proposes to be entirely plausible.",1442231573

The price difference of a screw is negligible, if you don&#x27;t strip the head, is re-usable, and in the case of using a 2x4 to get a strait line, if much easier to remove then a nail without bothering the tile.<p>Any reframing I&#x27;ve done to my house (windows, 2nd floor master bedroom ceiling, 2nd closet for the wife) I&#x27;ve used screws. Get a nice impact drill with the right bit - take a bit longer then pounding in a nail or using a nail gun, but it makes for a much stronger structure and easier to take apart if you screw something up.<p>On the other hand, you&#x27;d be hard pressed to find a good, strait 2x4 at HD or Lowes - dad has cringed looking at their dimensional lumber - a 1x2 might be truer to lay tile with or spend the money and get a real piece of wood if you need it perfectly strait.",1442229018

Some software is consumed by itself and serves no useful purpose in that sense, such as computer games or computer art. Those do contribute to GDP, so I was wrong to exclude them, but the impression I got from the poster was that software &#x27;doesn&#x27;t count&#x27; when it comes to the relationship between economic activity and energy utilization, whereas mostly it certainly does. Although the post seems to have been edited since, so the last paragraph does now acknowledge that software can improve resource utilization.",1442229015

Knowing the padding algorithm is not enough to make up a padding oracle.

Was probably expecting something deeper, e.g. why our vision of the future is always so wrong and dull and not only in terms of cultural changes. Take any prediction from the 1960s for example and there will be a lot of food for ridicule. A self driving car in the year 2000 (well, ok so far), going at <i>500mph</i> and the passenger reading a <i>newspaper</i> in the meantime. Can it get any more wrong than this?<p>&quot;Radio has no future.&quot; -- Lord Kelvin, physicist, the father of thermodynamics.<p>Our inability to predict the distant future only says one thing: things that we can imagine are already happening. The gap between an idea and its implementation is narrower compared to hundreds of years ago. With very few exceptions maybe: AI, &quot;eternal&quot; battery cells, easy space travel and a few others. So in terms of predictions, I think we will be getting only worse over time.",1442228761

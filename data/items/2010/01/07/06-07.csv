I've put it on the back burner because other priorities necessitate my attention for now. But I certainly wouldn't mind help.<p>I've implemented a recommendation algorithm using a modified version of TANGET, but it is untested. I'd love it if someone with more knowledge in ML than I stepped in and worked on it. I wouldn't even mind if they completely scrapped my algorithm and made a new one.<p>I think this would be a good opportunity for anyone interested in ML because everything except the recommendation algorithm is decently solidified: it includes several tools for testing, and it exposes everything through a simple REST API. Theoretically, it would just be a matter of dropping in your algorithm and seeing how it goes. Practically, however, I must warn that code comments are ridiculously sparse and there isn't a single unit test, because I'm a terrible person. There is, however, a decent integration test suite and some solid documentation.<p>It is available here: <a href=""http://github.com/heliumpigs/snowball"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/heliumpigs/snowball</a><p>These are also several related open source projects that we made and our project depends on:<p>* A tool for running blackbox tests on REST APIs: <a href=""http://github.com/heliumpigs/catnap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/heliumpigs/catnap</a><p>* A key-value store built on top of MySQL (inspired by FriendFeed's use case): <a href=""http://github.com/ysimonson/scarecrow"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ysimonson/scarecrow</a><p>* Some useful stuff for Tornado: <a href=""http://github.com/ysimonson/oz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/ysimonson/oz</a><p>Email me if you're interested (info in profile).\nPS: I'm posting here in case anyone else is interested.",1262847511

1036643,story,,,7,3,phaedrus,"Ask HN: When data is code, what is the meaning of a config script?",,"As someone going from statically typed, compiled languages to a dynamic language, I'm in a philosophical quandary:  when your language is sufficiently flexible to allow you to write your configuration settings files for the application in the same language as the application itself is written in, what does that <i>mean</i>?  Is it even meaningful to consider your configuration data as distinct from your code?<p>I'm writing a game engine in a combination of C++ and the dynamic language Io.  (http://iolanguage.com/)  Some of the operational code of the engine will be written in Io scripts, while all of the configuration settings will be in Io scripts.  (No need to invent a special text file format when Io's terse syntax makes it just as easy to specify settings data directly as Io code.)<p>It seems strangely arbitrary to make a distinction between the Io scripts that describe operational components of the engine, and the scripts that describe lists of settings.  After all, they are both in the same, Turing-complete language.  When I am writing my configuration settings, should I just pretend the language has less features than it does, restricting my Io code in the configuration scripts to just setting name-value pairs?<p>On the other hand you could go completely the opposite way and hardcode all the values in the scripts that comprise operational code.  While this sounds like a recipe for a mess, it would satisfy our minimum goal for scripting the game engine, which is that we want to be able to change settings without recompiling the C++ code.  It would certainly be simpler by some measure.  Although you might be editing a settings value while it is surrounded by other very important code!<p>We don't have to go to either extreme, but when the data itself is also represented in code, there's no longer any imposed limits on the difference between configuration files and code files.  Where would you place the distinction?",1262846998

I teach my boss's kid how to code on the weekends, he's learning Javascript at the moment. I've had to majorly re-adjust my teaching strategy about 4 times over the last year. When I started I was doing a terrible job, and now I know I'm doing a much better job (though I still have a long way to go). Whenever I teach it takes quite a bit of brainpower on my end as I try and get inside of my student's head, so I can see what's working and what isn't. I can only imagine how hard teaching is when you don't have the luxury of focusing on just one student, but rather 5 classes of 30.<p>In my memories of high school and college (high school in particular) so many of my teachers seemed detached, uninterested, and even bored with a lesson plan that they'd probably taught year in year out. I wonder how these people can be fixed? Can they just copy off teachers who actually try, or are they doomed to mediocrity? Can one be genuinely self-critical if one isn't motivated?

If it gets too tedious for you, feel free to ignore me.<p>Going back to the N = 5 things.

Getting the key entered is just a read instruction.  Sure, there maybe things that happen afterwards (as you said) but just getting the key is one instruction i.e. read <some memory spot><p>* Clear screen is writing zeros to a known address space *<p>Again, instead of doing a number of instructions to clear the screen (I have no idea how many this takes on a modern computer) you just need to write do write 0 <memory location><p>* Drawing is writing a 1 to a known address space *<p>My understanding is that on modern computers this is a complex operation.  But, in this it appears that drawing is again a single operation.<p>In each case, the point @tezza is making is: Hey, all you people who haven't ever used these crazy old machines, these are the types of things that make it easier to create a very small chess program (in terms of size of the program itself, not the resources it uses).  All these things that nowadays require a lot of instructions only required a single instruction on this machine.<p>The other two points, I agree, are probably not helpful.<p>Using the keyboard reading as an example, it seems whoever designed this machine said ""one way to reduce the size of programs is to make it easy to read keyboard inputs.  Lets have the hardeware store that in a known address.""  Thus, the fact that you can do this does help reduce the size of the program.<p>Am I wrong?  Let me know.  I've never worked on these machines so I could be completely off base.  A friend of mine used to wonder if it would be instructive to learn about programming under these limitations so I'm genuinly curious.<p>Note: I'm not objecting to your points about what reduced the size of the program.

I've been a mentor for GSOC for two years.<p>If I understand you correctly though, this is a case of a whole classroom forced into a single project as opposed to a few students in each one.  This creates a massive management disaster and many other issues:<p>1.  Coding for open source works best when you're interested in the project you're working for.  If you force everyone to work on one project, many people won't be interested, and in my experience as a manager/leader of an open source project, such people are an utter waste of time.  Of course, it's not their fault they were assigned to something they're not interested in.<p>2.  I've educated quite a few people in the full inner workings of our codebase.  But it's one thing to mentor one or three people; it's another to mentor twenty.<p>3.  Most projects don't have enough work for twenty people.  Assigning a ton of people to one task won't get it done faster, and assigning everyone a separate task will just make the load on the mentors/developers absurd.<p>4.  The single biggest problem with these types of systems, including GSOC, is the problem of ensuring that code gets merged at the end of the development period.  Many students will simply disappear, leaving behind huge patches with nobody to maintain them.  For example, the ffmpeg project has suffered greatly from this, with many feature patches taking years to merge and others simply languishing for eternity with nobody to finish them off.<p>I have mentored many students for my project, both in GSOC and otherwise.  I had one student who simply came to me one day and said that he wanted to learn the codebase: so each day he took one module and learned how it worked, asked me questions about it, and studied until he thought he understood it--the I quizzed him.  After about two weeks, he had a pretty good background in most of the program.  He has since become a significant contributor.<p>My policy is that <i>anyone</i> who wants to learn can ask questions and get answers in their quest to understand how things work: this was how I became an expert, so it's my obligation to pass on my knowledge to those who want to do the same.<p>I could do great with a few highly interested students.  But I wouldn't even be able to come up with enough tasks for a whole class, let alone the resources to teach them all without a classroom.  My suggestion would be to let students pick their own open source project, or some other method of splitting students between projects, to avoid dumping an entire class on one project.",1262844363

1036591,comment,1035081,1035590,0,0,KazimirMajorinc,,,"In my opinion, dynamic scope is adequate solution for Lisp approach, i.e. expressive power on the first place. Newlisp is very simple and expressive dialect, and it is pleasure using it. Dynamic scope allow some things statical scope doesn't. Sure, the price for that expressive power is that one has to be more careful, but this is not really that hard, and it shouldn't be the problem to anyone who really accept basic Lisp ideas.<p>I can see how dynamic scope - just like dynamic typing, eval or macros - could be seen as problem for people who want language like, say, Ada that puts safety on the first place. It is legitimate position. But it is not design goal or tradition of Lisp. Lisp is designed for AI, exploratory programming, hacking, expressive power, adventure. Owner of this site, Paul Graham, frequently wrote in that vein. It is simply not consistent to brag about expressive power of Lisp, and then turn into safety freak when one mentions dynamic scope.<p>OK safety freak is maybe too strong, but you get the point.",1262844192

2990696,comment,2985195,2988577,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"That example does not make any sense to me. Why would one side feel they'd gotten the better of the opposite side just because both are fully satisfied? Surely interests must be aligned for any trade to be successful and satisfactory to the involved parties, but in your example, each man is happy to have had what he wanted, and neither executed a deal feeling they had been shafted. Neither took an unfair advantage of the other or left the other with an unfair share as enabled by circumstance.<p>An instance of an unfair deal is exploiting the ignorance of a newcomer by offering to take something that has great  value locally for a price far below what your neighbors would pay before the newcomer realizes that his belongings have much greater worth in his new vicinity than they had in the old. This is a fundamentally predatory deal, and even if you lay all of this out in the fine print, it's your duty to establish at least a basic reasonable assurance that the party at the other end of your trade understands the circumstances surrounding it and is satisfied with the proposed trade.<p>Another example is that of an individual in desperate straits who is required to offload a good he'd otherwise keep or sell for a much higher price. It is reasonable to expect this person to sell his goods, but it is not fair to exploit his unfortunate circumstance and purchase the goods at prices in extreme disproportion to market value. While the person may even offer the good at an absolute bargain basement price in an attempt to move it as quickly as possible, I do not believe it is moral to buy something at much, much less than its normal value if you have the means to pay more. Perhaps some discount is reasonable in order to move the merchandise quickly, but it should not be disproportionate to the circumstance; even if the seller believes he'll be happy with the trade, it's not very likely that that happiness will stay. You're better off just biting the bullet and at least paying something that resembles the low end of market value.<p>Remember that when it comes down to it, our lives are all about the people that are part of them. Things and money come and go, bank accounts ebb and flow; people last forever, and people give real value to experiences and things. It's not worth shafting your neighbors left and right to save some cash.<p>I recognize that many disagree and believe that it's ""every man for himself"" out there, and that you should take advantage of your neighbor when you can get it. I believe that is fundamentally wrong, no matter how many others believe otherwise.",1315907414

In this case, there are enough skeptics, and enough sound logic behind them, that there is reason to be skeptical (again, go through all the quotes in the wikipedia entry I linked and see if you can dismiss all of them).<p>I would never propose that we should or should not believe in AGW.  What I propose is that we should be skeptical to both sides until we have the hard, undeniable data.  Again, I would emphasize there is a huge difference between a fact and a hypothesis.  Many studies have already been proven wrong, temperatures have not risen as dramatically as expected.<p>In the long run though it makes little difference either way as I have stated.  Regardless of AGW, we should pursue green technology because we are running out of non-renewable energy, and advancing energy research is perhaps the most important scientific field at this point in time.",1315907153

Yes, there have been such cases, but they are far and away the exception rather than the rule.  For every Einstein that was right when all of his peers were wrong, there are a thousand morons with websites that claim that Einstein was wrong, and they make plenty of noise and harass the hell out of scientists all over the place.  The fact that Einstein's theories are now accepted is no reason to lend any more credibility to the ""Einstein is wrong"" theories, in fact, the ultimate acceptance of Einstein's theories is evidence that truth eventually wins out over fancy in science.<p>For the most part, if you want to know what's true in a scientific field, you <i>do</i> accept the consensus opinion.  There are brief periods where the consensus is wrong, but if there's actually enough evidence to prove it, these periods end rather quickly and the truth wins out.

From a client point of view, they don't see this as a subpar experience; they have their app delivered rapidly, it looks great (as the designer just delivered PSDs or PNGs which look EXACTLY like the client wants), we cut it pixel perfect to something crossplatform (depends if it's a game or normal app or combination what tech we use for that) and in the end the client receives what they saw in those first screens they had made on their mobile. Generally looking better than 99% of the native  apps out there; the top 100 of iOS apps sure look good (well... not even all of them...), but below that it rapidly degrades. So unless you are doing something cutting edge, I cannot agree with your statement here.<p>Having said that, we do native apps as well; on iOS the experience <i>is</i> better, but you'll be paying a bit more to get it to that point. While on Android, it is just very very hard to get something as nice looking as we can do it in HTML5. It can be done, but personally I don't think it's worth it. For our development process we use 'business value' as a key indicator of deliverability and the difference between the PhoneGap apps and and native apps on Android do not deliver enough (actually any) business value to warrant the higher price tag.",1315904568

I had a network engineer write some clever code that allowed us to write our firewall filtering in either OpenBSD PF or Cisco ASA format, and convert it back and forth seamlessly.  It had absolutely nothing to do with what our company did, and he wanted to publish his work publicly so I simply asked our CTO if we could Open Source it - he had no problem with it as long as it didn't mention our company name anywhere.<p>In general, reasonable people usually come to an agreement despite employment contract language, and if people aren't reasonable, no contract language will make it a good place to work.",1315904424

How can you write an article about the mobile web, and reference MobileSafari one time, in passing, and webkit zero times.<p>The iPhone alone accounts for ~0.1% of browsers, to opera mini's ~ 0.02%. Plus, webkit is on 30+ million Nokia devices.  Even more relevant, maybe, is that webkit is actually the same on mobile devices and desktops, unlike Opera mini.",1201564502

105861,comment,105739,105830,0,0,pchristensen,,,"That's an idea that I love and HATE at the same time, with multiple reasons for each.  I love that I would get to hear what everyone thinks and love that it would be confined to one place.  I hate that it would likely incite lots of ugly, ugly comments, and that it would probably draw the useful, civil comments out of context of other threads where they would be appropriate.<p>Politics can be so divisive and get so heated that even people who are interested are afraid to talk about it in public.<p>I think the problem is that a political party or candidate is a very low-bandwidth symbol that loses most of the information contained in that choice.  The fact that a Mormon, a woman, and a black guy are running means that any vote can be interpreted as discrimination against the group not chosen.  For example, if you told me you voted for John Edwards, should I assume you like his economic populism or that you're too narrow minded for a black or woman president?  If you vote for a Republican, does that mean you are a homophobe?  It's like trying to express everything you believe about anything, the moral, ethical, and intellectual debates you have inside into two bits (party, candidate).  That's a hard problem.",1201564101

Xobni will be crossing this gap over the next year and we are looking for a database expert to help us build out our funnel tracking systems.  This means the chance to work directly with our VP Marketing who has led marketing from the beginning for two $100M+ startups.<p>We are looking for someone who understands indices, stored procedures, concurrency, query optimization, DB tuning, etc.  We are willing to bring on someone without direct DBA experience if they have the right background.<p>The idea is to work with us as a contractor at full throttle for a month or so to set things up, and then we can take it from there depending on how things are going.<p>Please send resumes to jobs@xobni.com, and mention the Database Wizard position.",1201563523

Disproof offered, viz, a visual display of all prior presidents, none of whom look the remotest bit like Obama, even after correcting for skin color.<p>3. Instant downvoting of disproof, and upvoting of false assertion.<p>Get this, chums. He wouldn't even pass for a <i>Kenyan president</i>:<p><a href=""http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/jpeg/bushandkibaki.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/jpeg/bushandkibaki.jpg</a><p>Enough with the BS. I read the prominent liberal blogs, and the <i>very day that Mike Ditka</i> dropped out of the senate race, and Obama became an uncontestable shoo-in, the party mouths decided that Obama was their future candidate. He was given the DNC keynote to officially start the process: It was an embarressing mess of nonsense (""gay friends in the red states""), cliches (""America...a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before"") and winking admissions of the two-faced identity politics to come (""They would give me an African name, Barack, or ""blessed,"" believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success."").<p>Fine, and so everyone in the media agreed that the intolerable bilge confirmed his brilliance. There's no fighting taste, and I'll agree he delivers better than Clinton (who sounds like she's adressing a disobediant kindergarten class) but <i>why Obama out of 300 millions</i>? He fit the bill, but what bill was it?<p>I made a prediction long ago: Obama is the one chance for the Democrats to lose the white house yet again. Hillary and Edwards split the white vote in South Carolina. The whole South will play the same. Hispanics are less than inspired by him as well. Clinton won the Hispanic vote handily in Nevada.<p>You have a candidate that is popular with two groups: Blacks, who know the price, and over-educated white liberals, who don't. McCain wins.",1201563327
105853,comment,105562,105562,0,0,pchristensen,,,"It's interesting to see how this guy has defined himself.  There aren't many posts (21 posts since May 2003) and of those, only 8 appear to be about programming.  Out of those, 3 of them are trashing higher levels of abstraction, and small but powerful languages, including Lisp and pg by name.  It strikes me as weird that a significant portion of his writing effort would go defending the status quo against a small, upstart philosophy.  If you're on Goliath's side, why are you so defensive?",1201563167

These systems would allow for goals greater than simple piracy to be reached. Goals such as freeing regions from censorship, preventing unlawful wire-tapping and curbing some types of unjust lawsuits.<p>So if bittorrent dies, thanks for all the free stuff! but I'm happy to see you go.",1201562717

105836,comment,105739,105798,0,0,jimbokun,,,"Presidents can't make laws.  At most, they can veto them.  They can't set the budget.  They can nominate Supreme Court justices, but have no control over them once nominated and often they interpret laws differently than how the appointing president thought they would.  I can no longer say that the President can not unilaterally declare and wage war, but I can say that the Constitution grants the power to declare war to the Congress.<p>So what is the point of the Presidency, then?  Especially in our day of modern media, a very big part of the President's ability to accomplish things is his ability to persuade the American people to work to achieve common goals.  So maybe just ""looking Presidential"" or ""sounding Presidential"" is not important in and of itself.  But if that is part of an overall power of persuasion devoted to noble ends, that can be a very important characteristic for a President, indeed.<p>Considering the current state of the Republican party, the Democratic candidates probably represent something closer to a ""free economy"" at this point.  And of the remaining declared Democratic and Republican candidates, only Ron Paul has opposed the war so unambiguously.<p>Also, not much commentary yet on Obama bringing in Lawrence Lessig to advise him on technology issues.  As that's probably the closest to being relevant to Hacker News, I would think that would get more discussion and some credit for Obama (again, relative to other actual candidates, not some idealized candidate who might agree with you on every issue).",1201561411

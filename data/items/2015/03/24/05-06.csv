9255071,comment,9252671,9254464,0,0,markpapadakis,,,"I am familiar with Little&#x27;s Law. The key concept is optimistic sequential execution. The overwheleming majority of requests do not need to page in cold-data or otherwise stall for too long. Also, in the case where they can stall to e.g process a lot of data in a loop, they can yield back to the scheduler, thereby being fair to all other accepted coroutines/requests and giving a chance to others to complete earlier. \nIn practice, at least based on my prototype and tests, this works extremely well. If about 10-15% of the requests may end up blocking the thread, while the read can read kernel-cache resident data and proceed, that&#x27;s really huge in terms of performance gains.\nThe background threads that either become owners and responsible for running slow/blocking coros can rely on a work-strealing scheme to keep them all busy, and if you don&#x27;t rely on them, thereby removing contention/stall from the &#x27;fast&#x27; threads, you are going to eventually suffer stalls and latency spikes.",1427175995

9255063,comment,9253690,9255032,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Actually, if you have a compiler with both TRE and constant folding, len2 will run on any sized list, <i>if</i> the optimizer runs constant folding before TRE or interleaves them.  Which I guess is your point, that your program&#x27;s behavior becomes unreasonably dependent on implementation details.<p>However, I&#x27;ll point out that this problem occurs in many situations already.  In GC languages, a single allocation can trigger a GC that will lock up the CPU for 50-100ms; this is a particular problem with Javascript animations.  In <i>non</i>-GC languages (like Python, Objective-C, or C++), you can get release cascades where the destruction of one object causes the reference counts on many others to go to zero, which causes the same problem.  A single blocking call will make your server sit idly.  Using a library function with O(N) behavior (like, say, string concatenation in many languages) in a loop will make your algorithm accidentally quadratic.<p>Practically speaking, the way we deal with these performance gotchas is to instrument the code heavily, profile, and measure the working system as a whole.  I&#x27;ve got some sympathy for the &quot;languages shouldn&#x27;t have dangerous gotchas&quot; viewpoint, but I think that most of the time it ultimately results in premature micro-optimizations.",1427175767

9255057,comment,9252671,9254304,0,0,markpapadakis,,,"This is a C++ implementation. Erlang and other high level languages use Processes(in the case of Erlang) or other such constructs to encapsulate logic and those are indeed scheduled based on either cooperative/preemptive fashion.<p>The main goals of this system is to minimize potential for blocking or otherwise slow processing steps which can stall processing of other requests, especially if this happens for many such requests/second.<p>Specifically, the &#x27;optimistic sequential execution&#x27; idea is that you run the request on the request it was accepted in, use mincore() to determine if will _likely_ stall if you read from it, and if so, either migrate the coro to a &#x27;slow&#x27; coros threads list, or just keep on going (which should be the fast-path here).<p>This is a solution to a specific class of problems. The similarities with Erlang&#x27;s Process scheduling is that a process is a lot like a coroutine (it encapsulates logic and data and it&#x27;s scheduled by a user-space scheduler, and that there can be thousands of them in runnable state, and each has its own stack).

I was the first technical employee, and except one other employee (the second hire), I&#x27;m not seeing other people better than me joining either. That said, there are a few things to keep in mind:<p>- Startup is NOT the place to be learning technical skill, especially early stage startup. The big 4 will serve you much better than that (and I know this going in). However, one of the things I&#x27;ve learned over the last year is that there are more to it than just technical skill. I have no doubt that I haven&#x27;t been learning anywhere as fast as I could have in term of tech skill, but I&#x27;ve learned other stuffs that might just be as valuable: from dealing with (less than ideal) team member, dealing with expectation (mine and others), being resilient, and a gazillion things that probably make me a better human. Startup is emotional, for better or worse.<p>- I remember reading a quote that if you can only learn from people better than you, it&#x27;s gonna be awfully hard to learn anything. As you eventually get better, you will have to learn from everyone around you.<p>- Since both of the previous points are extremely personal and subjective, I think that the one most important point to consider would be this: do you think the startup have any fighting chance? If the startup grows, both of those previous problems will fix itself. If the startup have no chance, well why would you stay there anyway? In my case, I can&#x27;t answer that question with either a straight yes or no, so I can&#x27;t decide.",1427173908

This gives them real street value.<p>And if a random professional poker player shows up with a random stolen chip that was won in a private poker game, the Bellagio has a choice.

They have sent me exactly one email a day for a week since I signed up because a friend of mine sent me a link to something that I found interesting.<p>Eventually I'll get tired of the emails and kill off my account or I'll buy something. If I buy something the emails should become even more relevant. GOTO 10.",1292828593

The more your step on a person's freedoms, the easier it becomes to do it more and more. You shouldn't have to justify your desire to access pornography to the government or your ISP (or any content that is perfectly legal for that matter) simply because some parents can't watch over their children when it comes to computers.",1292828546

The last time I looked into it, only the Wynn did - and then only to track denomination, not as a unique identifier. (Perhaps someone can correct me if things have changed) The goal is to help security detect cheating by tracking bets at the table games electronically, not prevent counterfeiting or theft.",1292828539

So to me, the extra effort in trying to ""remember"" a book seems pointless.<p>To me relational connection is more important that ""remembering"" a book. For instance if you can point out ""x event"" in a book I have read (if it is a particularly interesting part of the book), I can give you a gist of what that x event in the book was talking about and things related to that event. I can also recall similar events in other books I have read. However if you ask me to remember a ""hard number"" or ""hard fact"" I will most likely not recall it.<p>""Remembering"" a book seems like ridiculously thing to do unless its a programming book or you are preparing for an exam in school or work related.<p>You tries to remember books in casual reading?",1292828474

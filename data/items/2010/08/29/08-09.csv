It will help to plan before execution so you have a good mental model of the parameter space that your business is operating in which will help you with guidance when decisions need to be made. It would be delusional to think that you can completely model the problem before you have data so as you go forward you'll have to adjust the model and therefore the plan.<p>It basically is an instrument to cut down on the number of surprises that you'll encounter along the way and it gives you some measure of control.<p>Some people get stuck at the planning stage, they never make the jump to implementation, but at some point further planning becomes a pointless exercise and you just have to bite the bullet and do something.",1283071977
1643473,comment,1643318,1643405,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Agreed.<p>I lived and worked in downtown Chicago for close to 3 years. There is a large population of beggars. About 90% of them are black males. During the same period, I also saw lots of black males, who looked like these same beggars, in convenience stores and grocery stores buying alcohol and tobacco -- ONLY. Not other stuff along with it. Only those things. They often favored a certain kind of beer. I often saw that same kind of beer can, or wine bottle in a brown paper bag, discarded empty in the gutter or near trash cans in the same neighborhoods. Eventually, you put two and two together and conclude that it adds up to four. Do all of those beggars buy alcohol and tobacco with the money they get? Probably not. Are all of them addicts or lazy? Probably not. Are probably a large portion of them that way -- and/or mentally ill? Probably yes.<p>But once you see that enough with your own eyes you begin to feel less sympathy for many of them. Not a total lack of sympathy or empathy -- I don't want anyone to live that kind of life, even if it is a case of failed willpower -- but it also hardens you a little bit when there's a call for more aid. Some people truly have hard things happen to them, and it's not their fault. Some people truly bring trouble upon themselves, and it is their fault. And it's hard to distinguish between them from a distance.",1283071858

1643465,comment,1642941,1643367,0,0,onwardly,,,"This comment, like many others, is pretty critical of using FB Connect exclusively, which is something I understand and why I posed the question in the first place.<p>It may help to provide a little more context. The reason that FB Connect is used exclusively is to solve the pervert problem that has plagued videochat applications.<p>The FB account is used ONLY to track users, and on the landing page we make it very clear that we never reveal your identity to anyone and that we never post anything to your wall or your friends' walls.<p>We use the FB login so that if you are reported for misusing the site we can block you permanently. The thinking is that if we just allow you to create a new account or login with different accounts, then the pervs will be able to continue to access the site even if they are blocked on one account.<p>On the other hand, I'm getting the sense that this could be a big problem for legitimate users. Perhaps having multiple sign-in options would be OK, assuming that if you're a perv you'd be wary of signing in using your real account info, and that you'd really be going out of your way to be a jackass if you waited til one account was blocked before and then signed in using another account.<p>I'm surprised that the HN community seems more averse to using FB connect than I expect most normal users are. Either that or people that are critical of FB Connect are more apt to respond to this.<p>Lots of food for thought though. Ultimately, the question is whether offering multiple sign-in options dilutes the security feature of being able to permanently block those who misuse the site. While it does dilute this slightly, I'm starting to think that the trade-off might be worth it if only allowing a FB sign-in is so repulsive to so many...",1283071381

You don't really realize how harsh those winters are until you're in Toronto and you see the streetpeople after a night at -30 Celsius.<p>I've lived on King street, where it ends on the lake, and from there it was about a 20 minute walk to the office. Every day I'd walk that same route and meet probably between 5 and 10 people living 'off the street'. They'd all be equally friendly. They had their own spots.<p>The police in Toronto was pretty laid back at the time (I'm no longer there so I have no idea how they are today), when a really cold night would approach they'd round up the homeless people and bring them to a shelter. But every year, in the spring one or two bodies would be found in the melting snowbanks.

1643460,comment,1642910,1643392,0,0,philwelch,,,"The United States of America is the only country in the world with ""America"" in its name, hence we're called ""Americans"". (Likewise, Great Britain is actually the ""United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", which means if anything, calling UKians ""British"" actually excludes part of their population.) If you follow the general rule for naming nationalities (take the country's official name, drop any preceding ""People's/Democratic/Federal/Socialist/United Kingdom/States/Republic/Empire/Emirate of"", and add ""ish"" or ""an"" or ""ian"" or ""n"" or ""ese"" to it or drop the last vowel depending on what sounds best) and apply it to ""United States of America"", you get ""American"". Sorry we picked a lame and generic name[1]. I think we considered ""Columbia"" at one point but it's too late to change it now and people would confuse us with Colombia.<p>""USians"" is technically more ambiguous since we're not the only ""United States""--Mexico is ""Estados Unidos Mexicanos"", which is Spanish for ""United Mexican States"".<p>As you may or may not have noticed, the names of countries don't always exactly match every single geographical use of the same word. Some people in Greece were similarly upset about Macedonia, which is why lots of people call it the ""former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". I don't think anyone ever calls their citizens ""Former Yugoslav Republicans"" rather than ""Macedonians"", but my Greek isn't up to finding out for sure.<p>If you want to go further back, ""Germany"" and ""Spain"" are Anglicizations of ""Germania"" and ""Hispania"", which in the original Latin incorporated much larger areas than these current countries. I don't think many Polish or Portuguese people really mind, though, when I don't refer to them as German or Spanish despite the fact that they live in Germania or Hispania.<p>[1] Historical reason: of the original 13 colonies, they each had their own names, and the only thing they really had in common were that they were United in opposition to the Crown, that they considered themselves States, and that they were of America. By the time they had become a single nationality, it was too late to pick a more interesting name.",1283071229

I've never implemented Google account login, but if I didn't care about the social stuff I'd be leaning towards that.<p>Are you doing a ""hard launch"" with lots of PR, etc? If so, I would be thinking very hard about the risks in being FB-only. A lot of people will never visit your site again.<p>If not, then you have more freedom to experiment. I'd be inclined to go with my gut, but: metrics, metrics, metrics. From day one you should know how many people are being pushed to authorize your application to know about their Facebook identity, and how many of them are coming back after clicking the ""Authorize"" button.

Now, merely talking about news, about world events, about events in the industry, talking about new techniques or technologies, or asking for advice about business -- these things are not gossip. If my friend Tom said, ""Mike, did you hear about Bob? He did such-and-such with his wife. And then Steve did this and Dave did that but Mary didn't know that Tom did that so Steve said but -- oh but don't let anybody know I told you this, okay?"" <--- Bingo. Gossip.<p>Tango's a good example -- yes there is obviously more male participation in that, especially at the professional level. But there has to be, IIRC, because the tradition is to have a male-female pair doing it. That old saying, ""Takes two to tango!"" I was talking more about among amateurs, among students, minors, etc. And other forms of dance. And in suburbs and rural areas, etc. From what I can tell in my life experience so far those subsectors of dance all mostly involve women. (Can't believe I need to even point this out. I can't even imagine a point anytime growing up where I ever saw a guy say, ""Hey guys, let's go dancing tonight! <i>giggle</i>"" whereas I had lots of exposure to incidents where women wanted to dance, or take dance classes, etc. That's what I'm talking about.) Also when I talked about males and dance I assumed straight males. A high percentage of males in professional dance seem to be gay -- just listen to them talk or walk sometime. And it's clear from studies that they have biological or neurological differences in their brain and hormones -- a point which further lends credence to the notion that men and women are different due to biological/structural/hormonal differences, and that this is probably a large factor involved in explaining statistical differences in interests, behavior and talents. Change a man's brain/body to make it more female and guess what both his body and his behavior become more feminine. And vice versa. Transsexual adjustment procedures depend on this fact. It's science, not wishful thinking.<p>This is my last post in this thread. Talking about gender in society on the Internet is right up there with religion and politics. Rarely leads anywhere. :)",1283070027

Also, we're not hearing of all the times when people are allowed to film the police, but I have watched many videos of just the Seattle police in the past year with no legal repercussion to the videographers.<p>I think it's pretty clear that nearly everyone (except the police (except when being glorified on ""Cops"")) agree that citizens have the right to observe law enforcement.

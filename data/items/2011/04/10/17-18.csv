I love functional programming, but i think that we've over-hyped it a little. As you know(i hope), there are no silver bullets. I wouldn't worry about a language being impure, purity is over hyped as well, clojure is also impure. What I used to do with clojure was to take a bunch of components(compojure, sandbar, hiccup etc.) and glue them together to make an app. I haven't been following the clojure scene for a while, but i believe thats the idiomatic way to write web apps, not the full stack style of rails or django, where you just fill in the blanks.",1302457992

2429959,comment,2429603,2429869,2,0,illumin8,,,"It seems like one could pretty easily point out the logical fallacy there.<p>Another thing is that most governments and corporations don't necessarily look at the positive benefits so much as the negatives.  That's one reason why I like this dollar amount idea.  You shouldn't say ""each child's life is worth 40,000 pounds,"" but rather ""the potential cost of a lawsuit brought by relatives of a deceased child is in the millions of pounds.""<p>The same method could be applied to valuing nature.  You can simply say something like ""the value of fisheries from the coast of Japan is $20 billion per year.  Any release of radioactivity into the ocean could put TEPCO at risk of this amount in lawsuits.""<p>Corporations and governments don't want to put a price tag on people (even though there are well established pricing models, based on historical disasters).  By putting a price tag on the environment they can hopefully do better risk management.  Maybe they can make smarter decisions like: ""Increasing the size of the Tsunami protection wall will cost an additional $200,000, but will prevent the potential $20 billion in cleanup costs from a radioactivity release incident.""",1302457601

In the case where there is relative angular velocity, they spiral in, and then the physics of accretion disks takes over.

2429956,comment,2428723,2429833,4,0,azakai,,,"> An even bigger problem is speed. It only runs at ~10% of native speed.<p>Currently that is basically the situation, yes (but it depends on the benchmark - some run much faster). However, improvements to Emscripten can probably get that up to 25% of native speed. As LLVM and JS optimizers like Closure get better that will improve even more.<p>And JS engines are getting faster too. Things like type inference will work particularly well on code like this, since the code is basically statically typed (but not explicitly).<p>So, in the long term I believe this approach can yield code that runs at very decent speeds. Plus, when comparing to NaCl it will have two main advantages: (1) it doesn't require a plugin and runs everywhere, even on iPads, and (2) it doesn't have the sandboxing overhead of NaCl (NaCl code itself is fast, but communication with outside code on the web page is slow).",1302457538

However, if you want to reference an element in that collection later in your code, you have to jump though the jQuery selection hoops.<p>But you are right, sometimes you may not need to have every element in your selection wrapped in the jQuery object and it is up to you to determine which solution to use in a given case. But I do feel that most cases I see devs constantly wrapping $(this) inside of event handlers when they could have made an external reference/collection before hand and used that.<p><pre><code>    $('a').hover(\n        function(e){\n           $(this).doSomething();\n        },\n        function(e){\n           $(this).doSomething();\n        }\n    );\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>    var as = $('a'),\n        collected //using the same method as above;\n\n    as.each(function(i, e){\n       collected[i].hover(\n            function(e){\n                collected[i].doSomething();\n            },\n            function(e){\n               collected[i].doSomething();\n            }\n      );\n    );\n</code></pre>\nThis is a very rudimentary example and I know that there is a simpler way to accomplish this, but imagine code with multiple collected items who all match up on a 1 to 1 basis collecting the pre-wrapped objects has its advantages.",1302457269

2429940,comment,2429601,2429601,9,0,Tycho,,,"I think about 98% of the population are what I'd call statistically and economically illiterate. Basic economics should be a mandatory lesson at school, but unless you picked the class you can leave without even understanding the law of supply and demand. And then politicians, whose job is mainly to interfere with economic activity, blast these people with statistics (the significance of which they barely understand) about the economy, in order to secure their votes and Run the Fucking Country.<p>Meanwhile, people leave school and, regardless of profession, find themselves doing largely the same thing: sitting in front of a computer in an office. The productivity of virtually every job in the country depends in part on the employee's ability to use a computer. But unless they picked computing as a class (and, hell, even <i>then</i>), they'll have absolutely no clue how to <i>really</i> use a computer to your advantage, ie. to program it.<p>My suggestion: teach maths (which is already a mandatory subject) using computers and scripting languages. Let students practice abstraction to make computation/calculation easier; and then get them to model tougher problems and tackle them. Pick these problems from the realm of economics and finance, thereby building knowledge of another domain simultaneously (the only reason I understand what 'hire purchase' is is because my textbooks used it for exercises).<p>By the time they leave school, these kids will be no strangers to writing macros. In their further education and in their desk jobs, this will prove enormously convenient. Single handedly it could boost the GDP by a % or two (ok, I just made that figure up, but having worked in offices you all must have <i>seen</i> how inefficient the workflows are, and how one whizkid can make a big difference). It would even be useful in totally different disciplines. For instance in the study of literature, textual analysis by computer can prove very useful - finding all the references to a certain thing or instances of a certain word often shows deep patterns in the text. On my literature course only one professor/lecturer was doing this (he said it was particularly useful for Dickens), but he was definitely one of best in the department.",1302457228

But classroom implementations are a whole different ballgame.<p>If you want to actually improve the education kids are getting, there are a huge number of moving parts you have to address. In this sense, as a classroom implementation tool, Khan is just getting started. There's nothing to judge yet!<p>I've spoken with them a bit, and they're still trying to decide on the direction they want to take, how much they want to get involved in what they call ""change management"" in the classroom, i.e. making sure the tool gets used effectively. In my opinion, this is essential, but it takes manpower, and that's not something they can offer for free.<p>Of course, that requires having an understanding of how such a tool should be used, and as has been said, they're not teachers. The importance of them not having any classroom educational expertise is that they don't actually have a clear idea of how the tool would be used effectively. I work as an on-site PD specialist for Reasoning Mind, my job is to help teachers use this kind of technology. Khan learned a lot from their pilot in Los Altos, but they weren't being used as the primary curriculum there.<p>They're looking to be a full curriculum, what they call a ""textbook replacement system"". Doing that kind of thing effectively in communities that aren't as well-off (economically and teacher-quality-wise) as Los Altos is really, really hard. It takes a huge amount of work on the ""change mgmt"" side, high quality material, a ton of training for the teachers in the new classroom paradigm.

16743,comment,16603,16603,0,0,dhouston,,,"for me it was the same way that i learned programming or guitar:<p>1. start with tutorials or poking at an existing design until it does what you want; learn the fundamentals of html and css from a dummies-level book or tutorials<p>2. find motifs or patterns you like, and reverse engineer (i.e. steal) them: specifically, start with a canvas with the original image on the left and try to create it from scratch on the right<p>3. repeat 2 until you have a toolkit of techniques (e.g. web 2.0 motifs like gradients, rounded corners, patterned backgrounds, reflections, all that cliched shit :)) and can put together things from scratch<p>4. integrate more formal theory (graphic design books, typography, photoshop/illustrator technique, web design books, etc.)<p>your first few designs will suck, but you'll get better :) but definitely learn by doing.",1177526610

If you are still not sure you haven't lost out. Plus, working on stuff is quite fun. <p>You really need to test all aspects of the relationship with cofounders. So deliberately acting angry to see what they do or needing help and seeing how they respond are examples.<p>Spark is one thing you notice if things work out. Good luck!

16731,comment,16597,16671,0,0,pg,,,"I think the problem with Europe as a place for startups is not the government regulations or the immigration policy. The sources of Europe's weakness are the same as Iowa's: (a) lack of angel investors, (b) society as a whole doesn't understand or support you if you start a startup.<p>Whereas in Silicon Valley starting a startup is considered an acceptable thing to do (by your landlord, your girlfriends' parents, potential cofounders, etc), and there are lots of investors ready to give you money if you show the least promise.",1177525518

This is the way startups would begin life in the Soviet Union, if it still existed.<p>Business plan contests are only good if (a) they take near zero time (i.e. you simply submit a business plan you've aready written) and (b) the judges are people you want to impress.",1177525095

16725,comment,16544,16585,0,0,dean,,,"If your company fails, you are not obliged to pay the money back, you can walk away. However, if you succeed to the point of getting your first round of funding, then you have to pay back the money with interest. But I'm glossing over an important point. They really don't want their money back--they want equity in your company. So they will convert the loan to equity, however, they want up to a 25% discount on that equity. <p>From an example on their web site, if they lend you $100,000 and you end up getting Series A funding, then they can convert that $100,000 loan into $137,333.33 of equity in your company. Your company's valuation will ultimately determine just how much of your company you are giving up for this money.

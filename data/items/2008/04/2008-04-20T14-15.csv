168465,comment,168091,168205,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Often.  At my last employer, we ran into it all the time with Prototype-dependent libraries.  It was very common for us to rely on a single-developer open-source project or ISV for a component, find that they depended upon Prototype, then find that they depended upon different <i>versions</i> of Prototype and adding one component would mysteriously make the other fail.<p>You can't unit-test every combination of libraries that your potential users may eventually install.  And if you are a user, you have no feedback on which library caused the failure other than testing every combination of installed libraries, which can be literally <i>hundreds</i> of possibilities.<p>For my recent projects, I just refuse to use libraries that modify built-in prototypes or dump lots of functions in the global namespace.  I use JQuery and I'm willing to use YUI (though I haven't had a need for it...), because they play nicely together.  I'll use anything else with similar care put into namespacing.  But if it's not namespace-aware, I'll reimplement it rather than take the risk of it breaking other libraries down the road.",1208700223

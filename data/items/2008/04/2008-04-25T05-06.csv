It's makeup.<p>This is where you are pointing out a big problem in most organizations. Design in many organizations is treated as purely visual, when it really shouldn't be. If this is the role of design in your organization, then yes, absolutely, it is expendable.  Lipstick.<p>But you don't want lipstick. There's also interaction design / product design. You want someone who can, BEFORE a person even puts a line of code down, understand what the user wants to do and make sure the user experience makes sense in that context, through real user testing and rapid iteration. It's just cheaper to think and change on paper or a whiteboard. Once it's implemented, it is very costly to change. This type of design is not lipstick. It is the process by which a product takes shape... and it is not expendable.",1209102880

On the other it seems like something that could be manipulated to the advantage of the partner with access to more cash, and I can see such potential abuses being particularly plausible in high-growth scenarios like startups.<p>Everyone would like to believe they can trust each other and that these are just formalities, but situations change and when the going gets tough, who knows how someone might react?  So is a shotgun clause good or bad for startups, and can simple arbitration provide the same thing?<p>For those not familiar, here's some info about shotgun clauses:<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shotgun_clause",1209102151

Feb 27, 2008 at 4:22 am from Mountain View, CA
Problem: Internet domain names have a squatting problem. Buying and keeping a domain is so cheap that people will ""squat"" on good domain names, in the hope of selling it later for a huge markup. In the meantime, they collect ad revenues from people who haplessly wander onto their otherwise empty sites.<p>It is almost impossible to buy a domain from a squatter. They have a monopoly on that particular domain name, so they can try to hold out on coming to an agreement in hopes of receiving a higher payout.<p>Solution: A continuous posted-price auction for internet domain names.<p>The domain name owner determines the value V that they derive from owning the domain for a year....""",1209101592

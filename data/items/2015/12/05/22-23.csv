All of the companies in the biofuel world (KiOR, Solazyme, Amyris, Aurora, Algenol, Joule, Sapphire) spent a ton of money -- I think everyone on that list blew through >$100M -- to develop the technology and get to the pilot level. They all failed trying to commercialize.<p>The technology still exists in the form of IP held by the investors, so if the economics ever make sense again, it would be a much shorter route to commercialization than the first time around.<p>We absolutely have the ability to make large amounts of energy from algae, cyanobacteria, cellulose, etc.  Given a few hundred million in CapEx to get a plant off the ground and a few tens of million in working capital, most of those companies break even with usable fuel at ~$150/bbl. If you relocated the facilities to a low-cost-of-living area and started with, say $1B, you could likely produce for ~$100/bbl. Unfortunately, the return will be very low and unstable based on global energy prices. The pitfalls of producing a volatile commodity.<p>Another random thought is that we were seeing immense progress in the quality of work out of Asia for engineering and construction for the facilities. It&#x27;s <i>expensive</i> to put steel and concrete in the ground, shockingly so for many SV investors, but the quality was quickly improving out of China / Thailand for custom-engineered oil/gas processing equipment. Assuming this continues to improve, the future costs will be much lower.",1449356040

The importance of a book may not be recognized until it is reviewed by experts, and experts are a rare resource.

Even if they had access to all libraries in the world it would take a long time to recognize what is new and what is just another copy of a well known book.

10683566,comment,10676058,10683421,0,0,danharaj,,,"Well I think reading the book and evaluating its arguments and supporting evidence is the only way. I know that&#x27;s unreasonable to expect in a forum discussion but I think it would be rather harsh to dismiss the book out of hand because of a slip-up in an interview. It&#x27;s a failure of small degree, really. I&#x27;ve read other sociological works that talk about the skewed gender distribution in acts of mass violence in a similarly categorical way even though there are documented cases of mass violence committed by women. I think the difference between 100% and some slightly smaller proportion does not change the premises enough to invalidate the arguments.<p>I think toxic masculinity is under-examined and men are disadvantaged about talking about it and recasting their identities without it because, well, a lot of men in these comment trees demonstrate a resistance to entertaining the idea it seems on principle. That principle seems to be, and I have to guess here because it&#x27;s usually left implicit, is that masculinity is somehow immutable, innate, apolitical and unideological, and I think that&#x27;s a harmful attitude to take in the interest of society and one&#x27;s own interest. It makes violence against men at the level of identity and gender unassailable, unexaminable.<p>But of course some guy in this comment tree found a way to blame it on feminists and women.<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10683479"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10683479</a><p>> And traditionally women were loath to marry down, for example, whereas for men it was pretty common. I guess to prevent mass shootings, more feminists should marry down instead of complain about male competitiveness (which is 99% driven by women&#x27;s choices, as mates is part of what men compete over).<p>I think the reading I suggested is far more constructive than everything else being brought to the table here, really.",1449355785

Japan spent its time buying ships from Great Britain and sending its young people to school in the United States to learn what it could about empire building.<p>Late 1800s: The United States, wanting to be seen as a world power, attacks and defeats the world&#x27;s weakest &quot;World Power&quot; Spain, both in Cuba and in the Phillipines. Japan had been helping the Phillipines achieve independence and the United States basically stole the Phillipines out from under them.<p>Early 1900s: Japan fights and wins against Russia in the Pacific. They basically destroyed Russia at Port Arthur (using the same tactics as were used at Pearl Harbor). To retaliate the Russians had to send their Atlantic fleet the long way around the world. By then Japan had rebuilt from the battle at Port Arthur and defeated the Russians again. The lesson: Defeating a world power only requires you to be powerful within your sphere of influence.<p>Shortly before Pearl Harbor: U.S. cuts off oil supply to Japan. Japan needs the oil in the Phillipines and also wants to take the Phillipines back which they felt were stolen from them. Pearl Harbor was their attempt to recreate the Battle of Port Arthur and wipe out American presence in the Pacific, leaving Japan the most powerful entity in that sphere of influence.<p>The long view of Japan and the United States is that we kind of grew up together, but we were the bullying older brother.

You keep putting Gun forward as a kind of shiny, superior successor to Riak, Cassandra and CouchDB, which I&#x27;m afraid only makes you look foolish.<p>You seem to have done the branding before you did the code. First you need to demonstrate solid, mature code. Then you can try competing with the big boys.<p>A detailed critique of your code would take a lot of effort, but I&#x27;ve made some notes [1]. I find the code to be unreadable and full of bad code smell. With all the mutation and callbacks and events and what not going on, it&#x27;s just too hard to tell how the code is intended to flow. I don&#x27;t see a clean API, even an internal one, nor I see a clean structure. It needs a lot of cleanup [2].<p>When talking about code, it&#x27;s rarely just aesthetic. My philosophy is that if one can&#x27;t even manage the trivially superficial aspects of code (formatting, structuring files, naming variables, and so on), it&#x27;s not worth talking about its inner workings.<p>Sorry if this comes across as terribly harsh, but I hope you can see I&#x27;m trying to be constructive.<p>---<p>[1] A few examples:<p>* Your code is littered with arbitrary console.log() statements that have no actual utility. They look the kind of temporary logging I insert whenever I need to trace a difficult behaviour.<p>* No code is documented, aside from childish comments like:<p><pre><code>    } // IT WORKS!!!!!!\n</code></pre>\n* Lots of what looks like global state.<p>* Lots of anonymously named variables like r, u, n.<p>* Big chunks of commented-out code (e.g., in radix.js).<p>* Lots of what looks like test data. Are you telling me this is part of the project?<p><pre><code>    rad(&#x27;user/marknadal&#x27;, {&#x27;#&#x27;: &#x27;asdf&#x27;});\n</code></pre>\n* Lots of mutation. E.g., in s3.js you get some kind of event and then you modify the inputs.<p>* Syntax formatting is inconsistent and shoddy.<p>* require() calls in the middle of code.<p>* You have a test folder, but it&#x27;s barely got any actual tests. You do have at least one commented-out test in the middle of everything (list.js, line 25).<p>[2] You may want to look into replacing callbacks with promises, and restructure it using more classical ES6-based OO, as opposed to the prototype-based, lexically-scoped style you&#x27;re using now.",1449353687

They are the part that must be novel and non-obvious. When writing a patent, you want your claims to be as broad as possible (while still satisfying the novelty and non-obviousness requirements) to maximize the protection that the patent offers.\n2. The specification teaches a person skilled in the relevant art how to make/use the claimed inventions. This section includes specific details about possible implementations of the inventions. This section can discuss many different variations, and should make it clear that these are only some of the possible variations, not an exhaustive list.<p>Using a simplistic example based on your child comment, a sentence in the specification might state &quot;The phone may be black, or gold, or any other suitable color.&quot; (In reality, the specific color is not likely to be addressed at all unless it plays a role in the claimed invention.)",1449352953

As soon as you reach a significant size (a few hundred people), hierarchy is established;  leadership will then progressively solidify around a specific network of people, which becomes a de-facto separate class; eventually, you end up in a situation that is cooperative in name only, with a traditional managerial class dominating an exploited workforce; in the best case, the organization will share a culture of respecting workers slightly more than regular companies, but that&#x27;s about it.<p>Note that I&#x27;m not discarding the model entirely, it can work extremely well on a small scale. There are also &quot;hybrid&quot; examples (like the John Lewis Partnership) which seem to better embody the cooperative ethos than &quot;pure&quot; coops at scale.",1449352892

If the author makes such a strong incorrect statement about something so easily researched, then what else do they get wrong?

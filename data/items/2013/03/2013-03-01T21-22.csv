Other commenters elsewhere made even more clear arguments about how H1B might make this effect even stronger.<p>Second: other commenters have already pointed out that your comment about being ""well-networked"", while true, has nothing to do with racism.  So don't confuse those things.<p>Third:<p>> *Can we talk about racism?<p>Maybe you're content to just vent your frustration, and throw blame around.  Or maybe you want to have a meaningful conversation.  I don't know you, I don't know your goals.  But if your goal is to have a meaningful conversation about racism, or educate the privileged white people about their privilege, you're doing it wrong.<p>One of the facts of human nature is that people don't want to hear this shit.  If you want to illuminate anyone, you have to make a very careful and thoughtful argument, because when you make sloppy mistakes, that gives people the excuse they need to let themselves off the hook.  Just look at the replies you got: you said something that's true (""If you're brown or yellow or black... chances are you don't make the company club (as easily) as well, white people"") and then you said a few things that were dumb (""I've seen it with my own eyes..."", and the thing about confusing not-wanting-to-network with ethnicity), and look at which part got the replies.<p>If you want to preach the uncomfortable truths, you've gotta be on your A game.  And if you play a C game, you just distract the audience, which makes it harder for other people to explain the situation, which means that the racism will continue.  As well as all the other forms of privilege, which I notice you didn't much care about (your ""btw women"" notwithstanding).",1362175011

Now, if another thread C would start executing P' (taking the data/snapshot from A), then C's caches should build up and remain accurate. Of course, if this happens too often, then the caching behavior will be shitty. I always wondered (based on my interest in interpretation), how much I-cache misses the instruction cache flushes after inline-caching in native machine code cause.

In return, the homeowner agrees to a fixed energy bill for some period of time. The homeowner, instead of paying the utilities directly, would pay us and in return would receive a lower, predictable monthly energy bill.<p>Our mission is to build and drive this market.

Something like loop fusion is trivial to do by hand, so it doesn't confer any advantage on hand-optimized Haskell programs. And when you're comparing to C, you're in the realm of performance where hand-optimizing code at the expense of simplicity, maintainability or even correctness is necessary. Otherwise you wouldn't have considered C.<p>So high-level optimizations like loop fusion <i>do</i> matter, but only for the 95% of the code which is not entirely performance critical. It's great for letting you write pretty (and therefore easier to write and more maintainable) code but not great for squeezing out all the possible performance in an inner loop.<p>Considering that many GHC optimizations are of this nature, it's really impressive that GHC is still good at speed in an absolute sense as well. So if you desperately need to wring out an extra bit of performance, you can still do it in Haskell instead of having to use C. Sure, the highly optimized Haskell will be relatively ugly, but it's still better than C and much easier to integrate with the rest of your codebase.",1362173774

At Wello (<a href=""https://www.wello.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.wello.com</a>), we are rethinking how people get fit. Gyms do not work for 89% of Americans, but yet they are a $21B industry thanks to recurring fees. We are trying to change that by bringing the Gym to your home over live video and eliminating waste. If the country gets a little more fitter using our platform, thats all the more good.
We want you to come help us engineer this transition. We are doing what AirBnb, Uber and others did with excess capacity in their markets to fitness professional market. 
Our customers love us. Every 2 out of 3 users who works out with one of our trainers comes back for more. We just recently launched Group workouts. We just graduated from Rock Health and have some great investors who get marketplaces like us. We make money when users pay to workout with a trainer. And our prices are a fraction of the gym costs thanks to efficiencies we provide.
We use our own platform to keep ourselves healthy. No one has yet got a six-pack but we could probably all run long distance. We are small team, so your impact and influence on our culture will be huge. We love the Netflix philosophy of context and control.
Our technical stack is Python and MySQL. We also use Fabric, NGinx, Apache, Celery, Redis and RabbitMQ.

The goal of the study was to determine best practices for checkout usability by testing the top 15 ecommerce sites. One of the more fascinating finds they made was that during the checkout process, users perceived certain fields as being more secure than others. Even though the fields were all part of the same form and on the same page, users still believed fields with a little lock icon were  more secure than the rest of the fields!

""Expand Selection to Brackets"" will actually include the lines containing the brackets, so you can't use it to select the <i>contents</i> of a block.<p>Sublime also has ""Expand Selection to Scope"", except it doesn't really work that well: First invocation it chooses the current symbol, on 2nd the current brace block except the braces, on 3rd the braces themselves, and so on.<p>And it also has ""Expand Selection to Indentation"", but I don't see use for it in cases where you want to manipulate blocks of code, since it nearly always doesn't select what you want.<p>What I'd like is a command, let's call it ""Expand Selection to Statement or Block"", that:<p>* On 1st invocation, selects the current line.<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar) {
        bar = mogrify(bar);

        if (bar > 0) {
            slartibartfast = 42;

            [[baz = bar + 1;]]    # <-- [[ selection ]]
            print_report();
        }
        return bar;
    }
</code></pre>
* On 2nd invocation, expands to the current contiguous set of lines, bounded by either empty lines or language-specific block (usually braces, or in Ruby's case, ""if/while/..."" until ""end""), but not including the boundary:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar) {
        bar = mogrify(bar);

        if (bar > 0) {
            slartibartfast = 42;

            [[baz = bar + 1;
            print_report();]]
        }
        return bar;
    }
</code></pre>
* On 3rd invocation, expands to the current contents of the block, excluding braces and excluding the lines containing the braces.<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar) {
        bar = mogrify(bar);

        if (bar > 0) {
            [[slartibartfast = 42;

            baz = bar + 1;
            print_report();]]
        }
        return bar;
    }
</code></pre>
* On 4rd invocation, expands to the enveloping statement that uses the block:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar) {
        bar = mogrify(bar);

        [[if (bar > 0) {
            slartibartfast = 42;

            baz = bar + 1;
            print_report();
        }]]
        return bar;
    }
</code></pre>
* On 5th invocation, it would continue to step 2, ie., looking for more lines that are contiguous with the current selection:<p><pre><code>    int foo(int bar) {
        bar = mogrify(bar);

        [[if (bar > 0) {
            slartibartfast = 42;

            baz = bar + 1;
            print_report();
        }
        return bar;]]
    }
</code></pre>
* And so on. Eventually it will get to the entire function declaration.<p>Combined with a ""wrap selection in braces""-type command (that indented the selection, wrapped it in braces, and placed the caret at the beginning so you could start typing something like ""if (...) {"") you would have a fairly powerful block-manipulating shortcut.<p>It would probably be quite trivial to write such a plugin.

</code></pre>
If the JIT knows that s is the builtin string type and the split() method has not been overridden [1], it can speed this up by using ""pseudo-strings,"" where a pseudo-string is an index and length into another string.  This would require only O(1) time and space.<p>Garbage-collecting pseudo-strings would be an interesting exercise, but I'm sure it's a solvable problem [2] [3].<p>[1] If the preconditions for your optimization don't hold, you can always fall back to interpreting it.  As noted by the speaker, this sort of logic is already a critical part of many JIT's including Pypy.<p>[2] The problem is actually GC'ing the parent.  When the parent string is gc'ed, you have to compact the orphan strings to reclaim the remaining space; otherwise it'll be possible to write user code that uses a small finite amount of memory in CPython but has an unbounded memory leak in your compiler.<p>[3] You can avoid the trickiness in [2] if the parent string can be proven to outlive its children, which is the case in this example.  You could probably optimize a lot of real-world code, and have an easier time implementing the compiler, if you only used pseudo-strings when they could be proven to be shorter-lived than the parent.  As a bonus, this partial GC would build some infrastructure that could be recycled in a general implementation.",1362173297

(See <a href=""http://www.thinkcomputer.com/corporate/whitepapers/heldhostage.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.thinkcomputer.com/corporate/whitepapers/heldhosta...</a> .) They're designed to be complex. Most of the laws passed in the past twenty years have been designed by one man, Ezra Levine (<a href=""http://www.mofo.com/ezra-c-levine/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mofo.com/ezra-c-levine/</a>), who is now a lawyer at Morrison & Foerster. His client is The Money Services Round Table (TMSRT), and its membership comprises some of the largest money transmitters in the country.<p>Square has a money transmission license in California but it is not part of TMSRT. What's surprising about this situation is the following:<p>1) Square has a lot of lawyers. It has enough money and clout that they are probably very good lawyers. Yet even all of that money, clout (Jack Dorsey) and lawyering could not protect Square from this insane regulatory regime.<p>2) It is not clear to me, having studied this topic for two years basically full-time, that Square actually is a money transmitter. They might be, but they might not be. Per federal regulations (I think 31 CFR  1010 point something), they aren't; they are a payment processor, but states ignore these regulations. Even though the definition varies from state to state, it's hard for me to figure out what Square does with money that is not done on behalf of a bank, and banks are exempt from every state money transmission statute to the best of my knowledge. Usually it's just assumed that their agents are also exempt (hence the federal ""payment processor"" term--suddenly you're not a ""money transmitter"").<p>3) State regulators talk to one another but these laws are rarely, if ever, enforced. Virtually every payment startup I know of that isn't Square is violating them, including several YC startups, and even non-payment startups. It's not clear to me what happened in Illinois that their department of banking decided to take the lead on this. I wonder who has a major presence in Illinois that was upset enough that it happened.

I can agree with the perception that one feels like a indentured servant. There is always that worry in your mind's eye that one can get fired and would be kicked out of the country. My company went through layoffs two weeks before my green card interview and that was an insanely stressful experience because I was in the situation where if I had gotten laid off, I would probably have to leave the country. If I left the country, my green card application would have been deemed abandoned which means I would have to start over. If you want real immigration reform, make the H1B visa a portable work visa for 5 years. Of course, this doesn't serve the owners of companies. They would rather have the current situation that probably depresses wages but certainly leads to a situation where the employee can be exploited by unscrupulous managers.",1362172442

It's important to understand the current state to figure out how you got into that broken state; kind of like a breakpoint at the first exception.

People without a single major hit. Seeing the quality of their output, I would never pay that much, and yet somehow they have all the work they need. (Note: they're not marketing geniuses either.)<p>Just look at the rates people ask for, and get. They're way up there. Because there are so few of these people around, relative to demand, and because every Joe Schmo who wants to do a mobile app expects to strike it big, they can charge anything they want.",1362171743

And I'd like you and others to try and consider also less-tech solutions to tech problems if they meet the needs instead of automatically assuming that we made stupid decisions.<p>For example, any reasonable factory also has a disaster recovery process to handle equipment damage/downtime - some redundant gear, backup power, inventory of spare parts, guaranteed SLA's for shipping replacement, etc;  But still, someone intentionally throwing a wrench in the machine isn't ""dynamic failure testing"" but sabotage that will result in anger from coworkers who'll have to fix this. Should their system be called ""improperly engineered""?<p>We had great engineers implementing failover for a few 'hot' systems, but after much analysis we knowingly chose not to do it 'your way' for most of them since it wasn't actually the best choice.<p>I agree, in 99% of companies talked about in HN your way is undoubtedly better, and in tech startups it should be the default option. But there, much of the business process was people & phone & signed legalese, unlike any ""software-first"" businesses; and the tech part usually didn't do anything <i>better</i> than the employees could do themselves, but it simply was faster/cheaper/automated. So we chose functional manual recoveries instead of technical duplications. And you have to anyway - if your HQ burns down, who cares if your IT systems still work if your  employees don't have planned backup office space to do their tasks? IT stuff was only about half of the whole disaster recovery problems.<p>In effect, all the time we had an available ""redundant failover system"" that was manual instead of digital. It wasn't fragile (it didn't break, ever - as I said, we tried), fully functional (customers wouldn't notice) but very expensive to run - every hour of running the 'redundant system' meant hundreds of man-hours of overtime-pay and hundreds of unhappy employees.<p>So, in such cases, you do scheduled disaster-testing and budget the costs of these disruptions as neccessary tests - but if someone intentionally hurts his coworkers by creating random unauthorised disruptions, then it's not welcome.<p>The big disadvantage for this actually is not the data recovery or systems engineering, but the fact that it hurts the development culture. I left there because in such place you can't ""move fast and break things"", but everyone tends to ensure that every deployment really, really doesn't break anything. So we got there very good system stability, but all the testing / QA usually required at least 1-2 months for any finished feature to go live - which fits their business goals (stability & cost efficiency rather than shiny features) but demotivates developers.",1362171656

I think good hackers who are interested in doing a startup really should pay attention - what we think is interesting is useful is often not anything people want. Great if you're just hacking, but not so much if you want to build a business.",1193695028

Also, the value proposition is a bit unclear, in my opinion (perhaps because there are limited amounts of users, and it's new?)<p>For instance: What benefit do I personally gain from using the site?  To see what other people think?<p>I don't mean to belittle your startup, I just want to be sure that I'm not missing the point.  Perhaps a bit more explanation on the landing page would help?",1193694646

73953,story,,,5,18,cellis,"job offer advice needed",,"job offer question<p>Hello ycers,<p>I have a question for all of you.I have almost run out of money saved from a couple years of freelancing and as a jr. dev, trying to bootstrap a startup, so I needed some cash. Over the weekend I applied for jobs and interviewed at two companies. Both of them are heavy .NET C#/C++ houses, and they both offerred me 40,000/yr + benefits. But thats where the similarities stop. <p>The first company i interviewed with had a Tom Brady look-alike for a ""technical director"", everyone was wearing some variation of Zegna (might has well have been, but could have been Target), creative colored walls, and was essentially a profitable ""product"" company ( 10-12 employees ), with $1.2mm earnings on $3mm in sales. They do a bit of extremely expensive consulting ($200+/hr), but their bread and butter is in their enterprise product. Their adherence to OO and relational db principles was rigourous to a fault, as demonstrated by the robust 4'x 2' diagram of their db on the wall of the TD's office. They just seem like a perfect fit. The td ended the interview by saying that it would be a very steep learning curve for me to understand their system, even with my (decent) understanding of software dev.<p>The second company's contrast to the first was so profound, that during the interview, I was tempted to laugh at the many unprofessional attributes of the place. Having previously worked as a (gasp) VB dev at a small firm (~20 employees, mostly fix-it IT guys), I thought I was used to a lax environment. But this wasn't lax, this was sloppy. I won't get into the details, but suffice it to say that twice I had to jump out of the chair provided to guests to evade the live-in cat. Being a web development company with no proprietary product, they were not profitable, and still funded by who-knows and the few $40 - $80k websites that they developed . They were very folksy, and I actually laughed quite a bit during the interview. Taking 40k from them seems like a cakewalk.<p>I'll end by saying that I think I would learn a lot about complex software and whats right(wrong) with it/how to build it, or I could just take the easy job,hack in my spare time, and make enough money to get on my feet until i decide I have something good enough to show VCs/yc. But then, yeah...I was wondering if ""run upstairs"" applied in this situation.<p>So<p>As a 20yr old, cs dropout, self taught programmer and aspiring startupper, which job would you take?<p>I appreciate all advice",1193694190

If managers just focus on how they don't have the same strengths as the rest of the company's employees, seems like the managers aren't making good use of the company's resources.",1193694158

73950,comment,73634,73844,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"If you want to write web applications you absolutely need to know JavaScript for client side work. On the server it doesn't really matter whether you choose Ruby or Python. Both have good web frameworks and both are dead slow, so be prepared to write algorithmic code in C (now you know why you learned it :-). Lisp is conceptually much more interesting and (depending on the implementation) as fast as C. But the selection of Lisp web frameworks is anemic.<p>Just in case you ever plan to look for a corporate job you should be aware of the fact that 80 % of those jobs require Java and/or C#.<p>",1193694064

My best guess, however, is even if they've got such a system, it's sure to be immature and hence not very compelling.

73938,comment,73850,73850,0,0,MuddyMo,,,"Overall everything worked well. However, I did find the navigation in the ""Results"" page a bit counter-intuitive: <p>I entered ""beer"" as the seek term and was taken to the ""Results"" page and I clicked on the first entry in the results--""Beers"" which is a list--and got a new page with a view of the items in that list. But when I clicked on the second entry in the results--""beer"" which is an item--I didn't get a new page with a view of the item. Instead I got a preview of the item in the frame on the right-side of the Results page. <p>After further review, I saw the link to the right of the ""beer"" entry labeled ""view"" and was able to view the page for that item. I really don't think labeling the links to the right of each results entry differently--""preview"" for a list and ""view"" for an individual item--will prevent the user from being surprised by this behavior.  <p>Seeklr is a very intriguing site. The presentation is very attractive and implemented nicely. Good job and good luck.\n",1193692201

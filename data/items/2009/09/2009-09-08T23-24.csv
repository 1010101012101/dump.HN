812221,comment,811966,811966,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"My ancestors gave their $1 to the Knights Templar shortly after they were founded in 1129. Using innovating banking techniques (for the early middle ages) that locked in exactly 5%, no more, no less, every year, that $1 grew to $5,630 by 1307 - when the Order was arrested by the French Crown.<p>Now by this stage, French Royalty had overthrown the Merovignian traditions, and the Carolignians had implemented primogenture, which prevented that $5,630 from being split among the heirs.<p>As such, growth continued (remarkably, at a consistent 5%), so that when Louis XIV ascended to the throne in 1643 my family had claim to $70.6 Billion dollars. Several key wars, the revocation of the treaty of Nantes, and the Sun King's lavish lifestyle did not affect my 5% at all.<p>So much so, that by the time his grandson was beheaded during the French Revolution in 1789, my ancestors' $1 was worth $834 Trillion dollars.<p>Now Napoleon, on crowning himself Emperor, probably should have used that money to <i>buy</i> Europe, instead of invading it. But mindful of the powerful miracle of compound interest he was manifesting for my family, he did not - in fact, his wars of conquest were largely driven by the need to find that 5% each year.<p>You can imagine the relief in France in 1940 when that amount (which by now had reached $119.8 Quadrillion) was handed over to the Nazis. US Troops located the amount shortly after the landing at Normandy, and decided only the great US of A was able to continue the miracle.<p>And so the money grew, through Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan et al, until by 2008 it was worth $3,149,637,318,314,090,000. In one of his final acts as President George W Bush handed control of the money into my personal safe keeping (as with Social Security, he firmly believed I would be able to do better investing it myself).<p>And so it was that on this day, 12 months ago, I invested that entire amount in Lehman Brothers stock.<p>I should probably check on that soon to see if the 5% came through for the 870th consecutive year.",1252453619

And that's not counting the media (images,etc) which is somewheres around 200GB+.<p>I've often thought of creating some sort of offline Wikipedia, but it seems like too complex of a task to undertake in limited free time.<p>To mitigate the huge-ness that is the full Wikipedia, an app would have to take a somewhat more limited approach. It would have to start off with a Wikipedia snapshot (i.e. what the current page of each article looks like right now) sans media. When a user visited a page, the user would have several options (other than reading the page): [1] Download all media for the page (and store for future offline usage) [2] Update the page to the current version (with a sub-option to do media as well) [3] Download the full history of the page (with sub-option for with/without media).  You could obviously get a lot more complicated (i.e. 'set this page for automatic updates at a set interval', 'download the full history, but only download the media for the current revision', 'automatically check for internet connection/update page to current revision upon accessing the article',etc)<p>I'm surprised that there hasn't been any similar project. Probably due to some of the complexity vs just having a 'latest snapshot of the article text' and leaving it at that. Due to the size of Wikipedia, updating particular articles on a demand basis is probably the way to go.

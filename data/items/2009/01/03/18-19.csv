The stuff you had on you would seem miraculously fine, so could be valuable in trade if it wasn't stolen from you first.  But the best way to extract value from your stuff would be to give it as a gift to some powerful protector; money wouldn't be any use unless you could protect yourself against robbers.  So it would be all about finding a powerful protector.<p>In 800 you'd want to find the most enlightened bishop nearby, present yourself as a traveller from some obscure pocket of Nestorian Christians in the far east (drop hints about Prester John), and get work helping to administer his estates.  This wouldn't work everywhere, though: a lot of Europe was still pagan in 800.  If you landed in the north or the east, you'd have to try to find some enlightened local warlord instead.  Hard to say what use you could be to him, though; probably your only hope would be that he'd keep you around as an adornment to his court.<p>In 1200 you might still want to find a bishop, but if there was a town nearby (especially a great one like Florence or Venice) you could also find work in a bank or for one of the great wool merchants.<p>Generally: Be compulsively clean, and keep your opinions to yourself.",1231006738

418518,comment,417542,418369,0,0,fizzer9,,,"Sorry. To clarify, there are statewide standardized tests, which in turn end up resulting in department-wide (within a public school) standardized tests (a regular ""chapter test"", but the same one is given by all teachers in a given department).<p>When there's a state-mandated standardized test in, say, science, administration immediately jumps on it and says, ""Ok! Now we know what <i>our</i> science tests should look like!"" and in turn, science teachers must all toe the line, give tests that look just like the state standardized test, and teach to those tests. If Mr. A's students score lower than Mrs. B's students (and administration looks very closely at these test results), [sarcasm] then Mrs. B must be the better teacher! [/sarcasm]<p>Students ""pass"" their own class's chapter tests, partly due to teachers just passing them for the reasons previously explained, but also partly because they've been prepped and groomed specifically to <i>pass the test</i>.<p>Students ""pass"" the state-wide standardized tests partly because that's what they've been prepped for, and partly because of the nature of standardized testing. Think about it: if everyone does poorly on a state-wide standardized test, the state administrators making the test assume they've made it too difficult, and so water it down. Makes sense also because they want their state to compare favorably with other states. But regardless, what they want is that bell curve. They want it bad. They want to point to the districts on the low side of the bell curve, tell them to improve, and believe they've done something useful.<p>In turn, local districts want their own bell curves. They want to point to teachers with students on the low side of that bell curve, eliminate them (or otherwise reprimand them), and believe that they've done something useful.<p>Then net result of all this for the students is that they become pretty good at passing standardized tests but not terribly good at critical thinking. In class, teachers will hear over and over again from students, ""will this be on the test?"". The students crave bytes of information that sound like a multiple choice question with the answer attached, because that's the sort of thing that leads to success on tests.",1231006258

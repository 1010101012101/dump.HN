4377814,comment,4376306,4377123,7,0,jasim,,,"> You know what I do during my lunch time? Trying to re-prove Fermat's Last Theorem.<p>How many other students did you know who did the same? There are some people (you, in this instance) who like Math in the current form it is taught. But the sad truth is a large majority of the world's student population (that includes Asia) find Math a boring, dry subject that forces too many drills upon you for not much practical application later.<p>> The problem is no so much that they dump down math. The problem is that they alienate the students from math. When you do math, all of it, the result is made of your sweat.<p>Wolfram advocates using programming to drive the concepts better by making students write programs to solve the problem. You can't do that without really understanding the concepts behind it.<p>> I hope you see my point: there is no elevator to interest in math. Math lovers must have toiled and slaved over stupid calculation over and over, until a point that they could actually produce the trace of math working, just like the zone in programming or any other art. That trace, that focus, that absorption builds the love for math.<p>Again, that definitely has worked for some percentage of the population. But it in no way is a guarantee that there aren't ways to better it. The 'elevator' to interest in Math might just exist.<p>The point of the talk was that Math the way it is being taught only teaches students to do hand-calculation, but doesn't give enough importance to other crucial aspects (asking right question, modeling and math formulation). It also brings in Computers as a great tool to help students understand Maths better: by procedurizing learning and using programming to help students understand concepts better than just handsolving problems repeatedly.<p>> You know where self esteem is from? It's from holding a piece of paper on which a problem has been solved and solution has been neatly presented; it's from the overcoming of frustration and challenges that the problem presents.<p>It's also from running the program you wrote which solves a challenge well. That is an important idea that Wolfram presents in the talk (it is by no means new, but nothing much has come of it yet). How is understanding 'how' to solve a Mathematical problem and translating it into executable code less 'frustrating/challenging' than learning by rote a specific method to attack a specific pattern of mathematical problems and using that technique mindlessly to solve them?<p>I find that the comment fails to address those actual points in the talk, but instead raises rote learning and hand-calculation drills as something worth aspiring for, and something that separates the chaff from the grain. I disagree. There are many students out there who find Math (the way it is being taught now) boring and worthless, but would have loved the subject if it (the teaching style) appealed to their intelligence better.<p>(also, please don't overwork the students any bit more. its hard enough already for most)",1344887992

4377806,comment,4367288,4371101,1,0,cadlin,,,"This:<p>>I am not arguing with you about these claims. I am just going on what you say to me. The combination of those claims LOGICALLY ENTAILS that unemployment, being driven by weak demand in every sector, and NOT just by weak demand for certain skills in specific sectors, MUST be driven by weak demand for labor overall, across sectors;<p>Does not entail this:<p>>in other words, every single sector does not need any more labor of any kind.<p>If there is weak demand for labor overall, then there will be a weak demand for labor, not zero demand. Additionally, labor does not follow normal supply and demand models, and if you're not aware of the evidence for this I'd suggest you read an economics textbook.<p>Your argument is similar to that of people saying that because North Dakota has low unemployment due to its energy boom, a massive energy boom would cure unemployment. But North Dakota's energy boom only has such a visible effect because of the state's small population; Pennsylvania has added a similar number of jobs and it has barely changed the unemployment rates, as the the state has a much larger overall population.<p>Likewise lack of skilled employees in, e.g. the technology sector does not necessarily indicate unemployment is caused by structural shifts in unemployment, unless the tech industry is looking for millions of new employees and can't find them.<p>Between December 2007 and October 2008 the unemployment rate doubled. It seems far more likely that the United States hasn't yet recovered from the financial crash rather than experiencing an unprecedented shift in its economy at exactly the same time.<p>Unemployment didn't slowly rise during the boom times, it spiked because of a financial crash and has been slowly declining since. Any claims of a structural shift require extraordinary evidence, and all you've provided are non-sequiturs.",1344887906

Obviously not. Now I think the time would have been better spent tackling substantial problems with what I'd learned, rather than doing routine calculations. Does doing lots of routine calculations have an upside? Certainly. I can factor polynomial equations faster than anyone I know. While that's cool and all, I now feel like calculating speed is of questionable value beyond a certain point.<p>Now that I do math for fun, I spend most of my time doing recreational math style problems.

And I'm talking about that very thing.  OpenOffice style sheets are limited, last time I checked (same with Libre).  For example, it doesn't support style sheets for Table styles.  I remember having to deal with this specific problem.  The mechanism they have in place is a mockery.  In my eyes, if it can be styled, it should be styled using style sheets.  That is essential, in my books (and I don't think it's too much to ask).<p>I also don't remember iWork having it, either.  There are other issues, but that one stands out in my mind.<p>> but Im simply in love with the straightforward simpleness of iWork.<p>I keep hoping they'll update iWork, but again, the features it's missing are important to me.  This is mostly in reference to Pages vs Word.  I mean, even when you look at the full screen features of Word vs Pages, Word just destroys Pages in terms of attention to detail.  This is more about the UI though, so its purely my personal opinion.<p>Anyways, my point was simply that there are some essential features (such as complete styling support) that hinder usage.  I'm not asking for new features, rather that they support the features they currently have in a common, well-established way.<p>Note: Things may have changed since I last used these products.

People like to organize things in terms of visual hierarchies and landmarks.  Raw tagging systems aren't popular, because most people don't memorize precise strings. [1] They remember roughly what directories look like and 'know where things are' based on whether they believe they can confidently determine ""it"" from ""not it"" while they navigate a structure.<p>e.g. Was the tag ""RaptorX"" or ""2012 Predator"" or ""FooBird""?  The user doesn't <i>know</i>.  But they do know that when they navigate their project folders, they'll be able to pick out whichever project was fuzzily translated to ""something like a bird of prey"" in their mind.  And they'll be able to do this as they navigate into a tree, as fast as if they <i>had</i> remembered exact strings. [2]<p>So when people are looking for something quickly, they're going to like the visual hierarchy.  And when they're first saving a file [3], or when they're looking to open something when they 'know' where it is, they respond very positively to a visual hierarchy.<p>It's not about 'hiding' the fact that those 'folders' are tags.  Or hiding the fact that files can live in multiple places (with multiple versions no less).  We're still talking about new software that people would have to be trained on and told about its particular attributes.<p>So the fact that, yes, you need a dialogue to capture explicit intentions when doing move/copy operations in a pseudo-folder tag system is not a problem.<p>[1] Also why command line OSs and command line navigation are unpopular.  People <i>really</i> like <i>visual</i> organization.<p>[2] In my experience, this is what people are really saying when they insist they'd rather navigate than search, even when they 'know' where something is.  It's because they ""know"" where something is, in terms of landmarks in the visual tree.  They know in a fuzzy way.  And fuzzy searching is either frustrating, or requires nailing down enough tangential data (user/date/file type) that searching isn't any faster than navigating.<p>[3] Almost no-one wants to think about proper taxonomy or organization or an exhaustive document profile when they're drafting a new document.  They just want to stash things somewhere where they can find them tomorrow and/or reasonably direct a third party to them.  Proper organization is almost always a discrete mental process that happens after a document is 'done'.",1344885484

Like in many aspects of life, learning math is about balance.<p>In truth, people should learn from both areas simultaneously, since they are mutually connected. Calculating is a tool that makes you a better problem solver, and being a problem solver will allow you to find new tools to calculate faster. You can't separate either discipline from one another.<p>In my view, I think students should take one calculation, and one deeper math class a year starting in high school. That wat they could delve deeper in learning how to calculate (learning different methods for multiplication that might come in handy when doing mental math, for example), and start dealing with real, thought-heavy math from an earlier grade (learning about combinatorics, graph, game, and probability theory early in high school, etc).",1344885052

I'm sorry since I already praised bandcamp in another comment, however this comes very close to the better way you mentioned. As an artist you have a lot of options today - a label contract is just one of them. Bandcamp, Topspin, CDBaby (are they still around?) or direct website sales are the alternatives. And of course let's not forget smaller independent labels. It is perfectly possible to be successful without a major label these days. If an artist decides to go the traditional route, it is his decision and it wasn't his only option.<p>I seriously doubt that Dotcom has the artists in mind with this new venture, it is a nice way to advertise the service though and he certainly knows that. Let's see.",1344884487

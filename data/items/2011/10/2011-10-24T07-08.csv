3148676,comment,3148166,3148166,1,0,chrischen,,,"""After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.""<p>Steve Jobs' reasoning was probably the main inspiration for me dropping out. And he makes a really good point. I also dropped out before I had any form of ""success"" (and it's also been one of the best decisions I've made). I'd like to think that if you'll succeed in life you'll do so whether or not you go to college. But the pressure to succeed becomes immense when you do something like drop out of college. That probably speeds things up.<p>But still, I agree completely that this Steve Jobs type dropping out should not be so readily encouraged. I only did it because I was absolutely sure about most of the things Jobs described in that quote above.",1319443121

Even though it holds an order of magnitude more power than a single person?<p>Yeah, how about, no.<p>And about your other remark, that is nonsense. It is very possible to keep those checks to a reasonable level of responsibility and many corporations do so, with proper software engineering principles, without ""turning into Microsoft"".<p>When dealing with people's private information, one <i>should</i> err on the side of caution, not on the side of $$$, and it is obvious which route facebook took.<p>In fact, they are <i>already</i> in violation of several EU privacy laws, just because their privacy-pissing database has grown out of hand, they collect more data than they have the internal corporate infrastructure for to deal with this amount of private data of EU citizens in a legal manner in Europe. They went <i>way</i> overboard, maybe not in the US, but they are also incorporated in the EU and cannot oblige by our privacy laws because they collected too much data.<p>As far as I'm concerned, Facebook is on the verge of criminal negligence as EU laws for citizen privacy are concerned. So personally, yeah, I think nothing wrong with headlines of ""Facebook privacy fuckup"", as long as they're behaving like that, singular conscience or not.<p>That's why we have such laws, to keep corporations responsible.",1319443112

Sure enough, the risk is higher than going with ""mainstream"" Linux, but if you have the expertise, especially within the business, then it's a no-brainer if you will clearly benefit from all the great things FreeBSD has to offer.

I have a lot of respect for him, and he did something very important for our community, it was an inspiration for many.<p>Now he is doing great things for the startups community. While I don't like that IMHO HN is polarized, I still think YCombinator is one of the most significant phenomena of the latest years in our field.<p>But still I think it is legitimate to think that this kind of news sites are important enough that can't be polarized, that should be handled by many people (I want to create a consortium or alike otherwise lamernews would be like HN, with a single vision, but just worse since Paul Graham is smarter and with more resources than me).<p>Another goal of LN, not the site but the code base, is to provide to people a good code base to create this kind of sites for other fields <i>using little money</i>. Once those kind of sites start becoming big scaling them is apparently non trivial, but with LN this should be pretty different, we'll be able to do some math later when the site gets busier or when the code base is used for other bigger sites, but I believe that LN code base can serve a lot of traffic with little hardware, and the BSD license allows to use the code base in more contexts.<p>So I don't have nothing against PG, YCombinator, the community here, I just thing that at this point we understood that news sites for programmers are so important that there should be a ""third party"" involved in running them, without ADS, without job postings, without a big percentage of users being from a particular incubator, and so forth.<p>p.s. also if you ask me, I don't think PG is biased and kills stories against its startups, the things I don't like about how the site is handled are: the unilaterality of decisions, not fixing the site performances, and that PG did not resisted to the temptation of using the site to post job postings (you should try to realize how a huge value this is for YC however, startups are made of hackers).",1319442376

3148652,comment,3146229,3146936,1,0,pxtreme75,,,"You should not forget that, in-some point, ALL types of energy were sun energy. This was transformed to everything else including fossil fuels. Sun energy that arrives to earth is enormous. Even the planet itself uses only a tiny small portion of it to sustain life on all forms. My comment wanted to make this clear.<p>However, since you mention maths... here are the maths (taken from <a href=""http://www.ecoworld.com/energy-fuels/how-much-solar-energy-hits-earth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecoworld.com/energy-fuels/how-much-solar-energy-h...</a>)<p>In full sun, you can safely assume about 100 watts of solar energy per square foot. If you assume 12 hours of sun per day, this equates to 438,000 watt-hours per square foot per year. Based on 27,878,400 square feet per square mile, sunlight bestows a whopping 12.2 trillion watt-hours per square mile per year.\nWith these assumptions, figuring out how much solar energy hits the entire planet is relatively simple. 12.2 trillion watt-hours converts to 12,211 gigawatt-hours, and based on 8,760 hours per year, and 197 million square miles of earth’s surface (including the oceans), the earth receives about 274 million gigawatt-years of solar energy, which translates to an astonishing 8.2 million “quads” of Btu energy per year.<p>In case you haven’t heard, a “quad Btu” refers to one quadrillion British Thermal Units of energy, a common term used by energy economists. The entire human race currently uses about 400 quads of energy (in all forms) per year. Put another way, the solar energy hitting the earth exceeds the total energy consumed by humanity by a factor of over 20,000 times.<p>Clearly there is enough solar energy available to fulfill all the human race’s energy requirements now, and for all practical purposes, forever. The key is developing technologies that efficiently convert solar power into usable energy in a cost-effective manner.",1319442286

3148600,comment,3147743,3148048,6,0,Tsagadai,,,"<i>once externalities are internalized and the market is properly governed</i><p>That is the problem though, we are nowhere near the point where externalities are internalized or markets are properly governed. Presently any externality which can be ignored is ignored in the interests of maximizing shareholder value. This becomes doubly true when a company is really feeling the squeeze from the market. Every industry and business has externalities which are not being paid for at the moment. One is the environmental costs of manufacturing, infrastructure and energy. Another is dealing with repressive regimes. These are costs to society.<p>Regulation and enforcement are always met with market hostility because someone has to pay the cost (and whoever is paying usually doesn't want to). Self-regulation rarely works, honest companies may play by the rules for a while but eventually someone will decide they can make more money working around the rules.<p>Free market ideals are great and they all work on paper. I think it's a fine goal but an unlikely reality. Here in the present we are not moving towards a free market. Most moves to open markets are not making them freer they are merely giving greater power to the entrenched players. Until the market is truly free there is real damage being done to people and the planet.",1319440825

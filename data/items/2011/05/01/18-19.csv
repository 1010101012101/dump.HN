It was only a temporary extension to a small business incentive program that ran from 2009-2010.  The law still exists, but the tax benefits are significantly reduced, and it only applies to C Corporations.

The amount you save in taxes will pay for itself.<p>- If feasible, delay the execution of the sale until you have held your company for more than 1 year.<p>- Consider selling your company for stock of the acquiring company instead of for cash.  The transaction would be fully tax free if solely for stock, and taxable only to the extent of cash/non-stock received.  (See IRC 368, and related sections.)<p>- If you made the S election, you must unelect for Small Business Sale Exclusion to apply.  This has fun tax consequences.<p>And finally, \nDO NOT HIRE A CPA to do this for you.  CPAs know how to add things up, but they frequently get the law wrong.  Tax lawyers exist largely to clean up the mess created by CPAs.",1304276158

We're currently working on a startup called Tinfoil Security, and are moving out to the SF bay area in the next month. We both have a substantial savings we've attained from working for the past few years and would certainly be able to pay rent.<p>Both Ainsley and I went to MIT; she graduated in 2010 with two degrees in ""Brain and Cognitive Science"" and ""Writing"". I graduated in 2009 with a bachelor's in ""Computer Science and Engineering."" We're very laid back people, not prone to drama (and really try to avoid it as much as possible). Neither of us does any drugs, we'll occasionally drink (not to excess, just socially), and neither of us smoke. Well, I will have a cigar once every six months or so, but that's certainly something I can curb. :) Also, both she and I are 23 years old. We're both very clean people, and enjoy going out with friends, so you won't find us to be hermits. I basically can't survive without some sort of social interaction. Plus, we love animals.<p>We both want to make things people care about.<p>If we sound semi-interesting, we'd love to hear back. :) I hope the fact that we are two people doesn't make you consider us less; we really don't mind living in a single room together. Also, let me know if you'd want to chat on Skype or something to get a better feel for us; we'd be open to that.<p>Feel free to email me at the address listed in my profile. :)",1304275853

It's the easiest way to lose the ""cluttered"" feel of having giant blocks of explanatory text.<p>- Vary the fonts and font sizes. In particular, your nav. bar's font sizes are too big and distract from the section titles; you can lose the nav altogether for a landing page.<p>- Have a consistent coloring scheme. Pick 2-3 colors (maybe the ones from your logo) and stick with them: one color for the titles, one for links, one for text. E.g., using light purple for your secondary title text at the bottom makes them look like links.<p>- Make the ""sign up"" button stand out more.

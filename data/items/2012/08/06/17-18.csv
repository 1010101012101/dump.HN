What's at issue is something more like ""obtaining something which is not yours to obtain."" That invokes a tremendous question of what <i>is</i> ""yours to obtain"" which is not easily settled, and because we have competing intuitions on this point, Hacker News discussions can go wild between camps which take both extremes of the issue.<p>I would guess that it's at least a strong minority view -- if not a majority view -- that record labels have abdicated their moral authority to assert transgressions of this kind. It is not unlike patent trolls, where we feel that if someone fails to capitalize on a potential market and in fact attempts (politically, legally, etc.) to hinder the growth there, that they forfeit their right to be wronged.<p>So I think it's a shame that both sides never seem to get around to Step One, which is to say, ""here's what I think the spirit of the law is, here's what I think the purpose of law as a whole is; now, do these conditions efficiently uphold those ideals?""<p>If those questions are answered then it may not be ""pedantry"" -- perhaps they think that the purpose of the law is to stop theft, and theft-like deprivations of property.

The problem with isotopes needed for things like this is that they tend to have short half-lives (short half-lives = high decay rate = lots of heat generated), which means they pretty much don't exist naturally at all. So they will need to be produced artificially as fission fragments or through neutron irradiation of other isotopes. It's easy enough to produce large quantities of ""hot"" isotopes in a fission reactor which could be used for RTGs (ignoring safety) but the problem there is that if you're operating a nuclear reactor anyway why not use the heat production from the isotopes to produce energy there instead of going the roundabout, and unsafe, route of packaging things up in RTGs?",1344275649

I'm literally walking to a meeting with a user, but I'll follow up and edit this comment with details and what we're doing to prevent it within the next three hours.<p>[Update:] So, the background here is that 1099 reporting rules changed last year. A lot of companiesincluding some of our partnersdidn't yet have their infrastructure in place to properly handle them. A lot has been written about the change in the law (search ""2011 1099 confusion"" for a small sample), and there's been a fair amount of ambiguity and confusion overall (Citibank issued 1099s for frequent flyer miles; whether this was necessary isn't yet clear). Due to this confusion, the IRS actually backed off plans to require the reconciliation of Form 1099K in tax returns filed for 2011.<p>In Stripe's case, one of our banking partners responsible for the filings was unable to meet the original filing date for all 1099s. While they filed a proper extension with the IRS, this meant that receipt of your 1099 was delayed.<p>As you point out, we should have done a much better job communicating this at each step -- and, obviously, receiving tax forms in mid-April is not an acceptable outcome regardless. We are working on controlling the process much more closely ourselves next year so that this does not happen again.<p>But the bottom line is: sorry. We built Stripe to make this kind of hassle go away, and we're doing everything we can to make sure that this was a one-off blip.",1344275443

If not, then sure: the question as answered might be somewhat vaguely reasonable, in that it is more ""free association in the mind of the person answering the question""; but if you have some actual purpose to asking, maybe to provide better ""how to move from language X to Clojure"" documentation, or to know on what forums and in what magazines outreach efforts should be coordinated, or to get a feel for the kinds of language and library features that people may be missing, the question as stated isn't really going to help, and may as well be replaced with the much simpler ""what is your favorite non-Clojure language"".<p>Again: the developer might actually consider himself a JavaScript developer, consider JavaScript even to be the one true language that binds all other languages together and by which all other languages should be understood, and thereby is his ""primary language"", and yet in his world he just replaced every single moment he used to use Python with Clojure. The answer ""JavaScript"" is then of some vague interest, but honestly he wasn't even using JavaScript for these tasks before even though he theoretically could have been: for some reason the kind of task he is now using Clojure for was dominated before by Python in his mind, and that's what it is going to be compared to and what it is going to be replacing.",1344274148

4346120,comment,4339999,4339999,1,0,alexeiz,,,"This document reinforces my opinion that most coding standard documents suck.  Ive seen a countless number of coding standards from different companies (some of the companies I even worked for) and they all sucked.  No exception.  Even though coding standards have some common sense advice and guidelines which is generally helpful for producing code of good quality, the amount of arbitrary irrational rules and beliefs that coding standards writers put into the standards and try to enforce through the standards actually end up hurting the quality of the code produced by developers trying to follow those rules.<p>Case in point with examples from the NASA JPL coding standards for C:<p>* no direct or indirect recursion\nWhat is it, FORTRAN-77?  Some algorithms are way easier to implement recursively whereas the iterative algorithm can be much less straightforward and buggier.  Think sorting: its easy to prove that the recursion is finite and that the implementation of the algorithm is correct.  Do they use sorting in NASA or is it prohibited by this rule?<p>* no dynamic memory after initialization\nFORTRAN-77 again!  While dynamic memory management can be challenging in real-time systems and the generic malloc/free implementation is not acceptable, it doesnt mean that statically pre-allocated fixed-size memory is better.  It inevitably leads to brittle code ripe with excessive memory use, bugs like static buffer overruns, and sometimes even inability to use dynamic data structures like linked lists.  To work around this restriction, a developer can construct a linked list structure in a statically allocated memory, but doing so is essentially equivalent to creating your own dynamic memory manager which is more likely to be poorly implemented than a good dynamic memory manager.  Instead of denying the use of dynamic memory they should develop memory managers with acceptable performance characteristics.<p>* The return value of non-void functions shall be checked or used by each calling function, or explicitly cast to (void) if irrelevant.\nGiven that there are a lot of library functions in C that return some error code rarely useful, this rule leads to code littered with (void) casts: (void) printf(), (void) close(), etc.  Along with the littering the rule doesnt make the code any more robust because it encourages to use (void) casts to ignore error codes and therefore error codes will likely be ignored rather than handled correctly.<p>* All functions of more than 10 lines should have at least one assertion.\nThis leads to littering code with assertions in those functions that dont necessarily have anything to assert and that are accidentally longer than 10 lines (for example, due to mandatory parameter validation checks.  I hope parameter validation checks are not assertions, are they?).<p>* All #else, #elif and #endif preprocessor directives shall reside in the same file as the #if or #ifdef directive to which they are related.\nThis is just a bizarre rule.  What developer puts #ifdef in one file and #endif in another?  Unless of course hes drunk or high but I hope thats not how NASA develops its software.<p>* Conversions shall not be performed between a pointer to a function and any type other than an integral type.\nWait, pointers to functions should be converted to which integral type?  They are a number of integral types: char, short, unsigned long long.  Which one do I choose?  Why not void* or intptr_t?<p>* Functions should be no longer than 60 lines of text and define no more than 6 parameters.\nFinally a good rule.  But what does the explanation say?  A function should not be longer than what can be printed on a single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per statement and one line per declaration.  Printed on a sheet of paper?

The most common case being when Javascript is disabled the form posts to the website because the developer didn't design with graceful degradation, a dangerous mistake when mixed with credit card numbers.<p>Only if you do it wrong. From the Stripe docs: ""The only thing to note is how input fields representing sensitive card data (number, CVC, expiration month and year) do not have a 'name' attribute. This prevents them from hitting your server when the form is submitted.""<p>> It doesn't appear to be a problem for you (your payment page for CC info doesn't gracefully degrade with JS disabled and is impassible - you might want to fix that!) but I've seen it on other sites, and it's especially a problem when other sites don't use SSL as a fail safe for this sort of case which I have also seen.<p>Again, SSL is covered by the docs.

Either a download or a stream or any other ""legitimate"" method. If a label or artist only cared about securing the maximum number of listens then they would make the song free, but (most) choose not to, which would indicate they want every listen to be a paid listen (or through an official streaming system), correct?<p>> A huge percentage of pirates not only had no intention on purchasing, but no money to purchase with. Not that they're necessarily entitled to the music, but the money you want to pretend is being lost just doesn't exist. What use is telling these people not to be so ""selfish""? How is that a solution?<p>I'm not pretending money is disappearing and then 100,000 illegal downloads = $100,000 in lost revenue. I'm stating that if an artist or label publishes a song online and they decide it will cost $1 to download then they should be able to expect 100,000 downloads to net them $100,000 in revenue. If 100,000 downloads means only net $5000 in revenue (95,000 illegal downloads, 5000 legitimate) then that is unreasonable and they should be able to consider that ""bad"", and make efforts to stop that (through shutting down of illegal download services).<p>> Piracy is a systemic problem due to copyright's flaws, not the other way around.

I'm as good as I am due to the work I've put in, but not yet as good as I can be.  And this applies equally on all my endeavors (as well as it applies to those 12 year olds), it was just most apparent when I first started studying music.<p>It's very humbling to be schooled by a 12 year old.  It takes a lot of restraint to take that extra step and be able to learn from them.  Just last week I had a guitar lesson from a 16 year old.  Half my age, but with twice my experience playing guitar.  And I set aside my ego and I learned what I could, and I've set aside my XBox and am putting in the time to practice what he's suggesting for me to learn.<p>If you haven't tried learning an instrument it's a rewarding challenge and there's a lot you can learn that you can apply to other areas of your life.",1344273143

Labels don't just take a chunk and provide no value, otherwise why would anyone sign? Labels provide a lot of value: value that (apparently) nobody on the internet understands.<p>Justin Bieber is a great example, he was a dumb kid on Youtube singing songs and had a small fanbase, he could have continued alone to make songs and maybe sell them on Bandcamp and maybe make a few thousand $, instead he chose to sign with a label and today is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if not more. He is a global brand. Would Justin Bieber be worth $xxx,xxx,xxx today if he stuck it alone? Has any independent musician ever done that before? The value of labels is clear.<p>People don't need labels now to build a following, that much is true, but that doesn't mean labels should not expect the same protections that other business types get.

There's no better illustration of that than Rockstar.<p>Tactically, making a separate Rockstar was a clever move. It evaded the licensing commitments made after the Nortel auction and opens up a new front that the Android world (except Sony) has to defend. But here's the thing... even if that is all Apple and Microsoft care about, it doesn't end there. Rockstar is a free-standing patent troll with a mandate to attack anything and everything but its creators.<p>Suppose someone wants to do something with Open WebOS. That would probably fall apart once Rockstar came calling. Suppose Jolla actually gets somewhere with Meego. They'd better not plan on entering the US market unless they have a plan for Rockstar. Carriers and ISPs probably need to think twice about buying telecom equipment from companies other than Ericsson. After all, it's unlikely that Huawei (#1 telecom equipment vendor in the world) and ZTE (#3 telecom equipment vendor) are in Rockstar's good books. And so on.<p>Creating the Rockstar patent troll is easily the worst move so far in the smartphone patent wars. The companies behind it no longer have any claim to being victims of anyone. They are unequivocally the aggressors and we should all treat them as such.",1344272501

Would you rather those poorly written games never be playable under emulation? Because until now, they weren't playable. And now they are on moderate PC desktops. And personally, I don't think the extra emulator overhead will matter in 20 years when our cell phones have ten times the power needed for it.",1344272475

For text editing, lifting your arms from the keyboard area of the screen, or from a Bluetooth keyboard, to scroll the page, select a tool, insert the cursor, select some content, etc. is much less efficient than reaching sideways for a mouse and scrolling its wheel or clicking its buttons, with only subtle movements needed to position the cursor while you rest your hand on the mouse. It is both tiring and tedious to perform certain tasks without a mouse, and until eyeball tracking is workable, you're still going to want a mouse and keyboard device accessible.",1344272463

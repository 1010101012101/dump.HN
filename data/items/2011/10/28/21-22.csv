In the same way that a PR problem is still a problem, a perceived danger is still something that needs to be addressed.  This is why perspective is important: because we don't <i>perceive</i> the danger, it's hard for us to empathize (or even sympathize), and you get comments like ""just get over it"".<p>Also, my focus on the terms ""beaten, killed or raped"" may have been more distracting than necessary, because we are talking about more than just physical oppression; there is also shaming, ostracism, objectification, and a host of other emotional attacks.",1319836744

When you hydrolyze water some reforms back into steam and escapes. So you subtract that energy as lost in your calculations of output - input. The error is in not correctly calculating how much energy is actually lost vs left in the experiment.<p>Good experiments don't allow any steam to be lost, they are perfectly insulated and keep everything inside the cell. Unfortunately it's extremely hard to do this accurately. (Or you can generate so much energy it's more than the input without subtracting the losses, but no one has ever been able to do that.)<p>The reason for not reliably, is that experiments look for signs of radiation. Palladium is sometimes sourced from refined nuclear waste. It's refined extremely well, it's perfectly safe.

With aspirations of one day starting my own.<p>I grew up in a predominately black neighborhood of the city in the US with the highest percentage black population...<p>Those things said this issue is both an educational and more importantly a multi generational wealth problem.<p>I previously discussed at this article here: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2438411"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2438411</a><p>Most black kids don't learn much about computers or computing at an early age and secondly don't have family who can afford for them to have one at home to learn on. They don't have friends who are curious about these things to take from and share with either.<p>In many of my favorite stories about the most successful tech companies in their infancy you hear about this basically band of brothers with (Steve and Woz, Bill and Paul, Zuckerburg and his roomates) alot of under represented in tech minorites don't have this.<p>I was fortunate that my family could afford for me to have a computer to learn on. But I didn't start learning to program until midway through high school and many times without any help of anyone knowledgeable in my own area town.<p>Not to mention the things they chose to do were what many people would consider very risky (all of them dropped out of school at one point or another)<p>I'll close with this part of my comment from that earlier thread<p>"" <i>Even if its not that risk taking is discouraged, risk averse or more conservative routes are certainly encouraged more.\nThere is also the pressure of not having multi generational wealth to fall back on.\nNot having previously successful family to lean on in times of need or if things don't go right is a strong precursor to risk aversion</i> ""<p>To do that instead of something with much more strongly defined career path (ie doctor, lawyer, dentist, etc.) is tough for many minorities when they have to worry about whether or not their family will be financially sound<p><i>Edit:</i>\n- Another important reason I generally avoid these conversations is because I too strongly believe that Silicon Valley and the Tech Industry as a whole are meritocracies.<p>But that is why I chose to comment. To help explain that the issues aren't that blacks and other under represented minorities aren't excluded for racism reasons but for circumstances that leave them uninformed, underprepared, or completely without the ability to compete.",1319835725

I think that more people <i>should</i> care, but it's ultimately your choice to make, not mine.  At least you're making an informed decision and I can respect that even if I disagree.<p>My worry is that many people don't care right now because they're not informed and because Apple isn't doing anything most people would care about.  And that sets things up for someday when, in the pursuit of profit, they will start abusing it in ways that most people care about.  By then, it will be too late.<p>Maybe I'm wrong about that.  It turned out that I was right about Sony, though.  I would have liked to buy some of their products, even knowing their faults, but I refused.  And I by refusing to buy from them from the start, I avoided all sorts of trouble later on.<p>True, Apple could be a different case.  I just <i>don't care</i> enough about them to find that out the hard way.",1319835669

You crack open the machine, and it's like Christmas.<p>I think if you did this with a higher-margin item, say DVDs or electronics, you could retire. But the trick is, as you note, scaling all the footwork and overhead. It's not like you can farm out the collection and restocking, not unless you really, really trust somebody. And chasing around 100-300 machines, the people that manage the site, and the product that works? It's not a trivial thing to do at all.<p>Not only maintenance, there's also always moving the machines around, and pitching store owners to put a machine onsite. Some of them look at it like competition. A couple guys refused to place them unless they got a piece of the action! After she finished pitching, they decided they would go out and buy their own machines. All for 20 bucks a month. Dang cheapskates. And don't forget there are big, serious players out there who wouldn't think twice of using dirty tricks (and the know them all) to quash you like a bug. She's lucky she's under the radar. Somebody dropping a couple hundred thousand for a few dozen high-end machines would not go unnoticed.<p>I actually like the business model a lot. It encourages direct selling, there's lots of business math, and there aren't a lot of tricky issues involved.<p>So yes! Kinda. If you could retire on 400-1200 bucks a month, I think it would work. Past that point, though, it gets ugly. Small scale? It rocks. Large scale? It looks much better on TV than it actually is.",1319835632

7630765,comment,7623872,7630545,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,">But until we have a solid theory about consciousness, with the possibility of proving a claim to be objectively true or false, all we have are assumptions.<p>Your wording implies that all the different possibilities are equally probable. This is not the case. We &quot;assume&quot; that the explanation for conscious experience lies in materialism because it is the most probable answer given what we know. This is the rational choice here. Your usage of &quot;assumption&quot; is too layman to be useful in this discussion. Probability currently tells us that materialism is our best answer, and so we use that in our current model of the world.<p>>But consciousness is by definition a non-material phenomenon, so that&#x27;s the wrong approach.<p>This isn&#x27;t very useful. Energy is non-material, yet it can be measured using material detectors. Consciousness can be studied through material processes. Measuring brain mechanics, or simply questioning a subject about their experience are all material ways to study consciousness. We can&#x27;t measure the metaphysical properties of consciousness, by definition. But then again we don&#x27;t know that they exist either.<p>> If I see a black swan, I have falsified the all-white-swans theory, not to some probability, but absolutely.<p>Inherent in your conclusion is the probability distribution of your black-swan detection tool. What is the probability that it measured incorrectly?<p>The problem with the metaphysical types is that you propose some exotic mechanism simply because you can&#x27;t imagine how natural phenomena could give rise to consciousness. This is simply a failure of imagination on your part. Until metaphysical explanations are <i>required</i> it is folly to assume that they are necessary.",1398203991

7630754,comment,7628472,7630531,9,0,burntsushi,,,"I think the solution posed to you is at least much better than what your comment thread started with: defining the entire JSON structure with Go types. Actually, I think it&#x27;s a lot better. Personally, I&#x27;d probably stop there---even if I were prototyping.<p>But, at your insistence, we can keep digging. It&#x27;s easy to write a polymorphic function that arbitrarily picks out values from a Go `interface{}` value.<p><pre><code>    func lookup(v interface{}, keys ...string) interface{} {\n    \tswitch len(keys) {\n    \tcase 0: return v\n    \tdefault:\n    \t\tdict, ok := v.(map[string]interface{})\n    \t\tif !ok {\n    \t\t\tpanic(fmt.Sprintf(&quot;%T is not a dictionary&quot;, v))\n    \t\t}\n    \t\treturn lookup(dict[keys[0]], keys[1:]...)\n    \t}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nAnd then we can use it like you would in Python:<p><pre><code>    lookup(response, &quot;level_one&quot;, &quot;level_two&quot;, &quot;eventual_value&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThis doesn&#x27;t completely remove the burden of type asserting (unfortunate), but it at least makes nested lookups much easier. Arguably, the nested lookups are probably where the type asserts hurt the most.<p>Full example: <a href=""http://play.golang.org/p/4tWtqGRgU6"" rel=""nofollow"">http://play.golang.org/p/4tWtqGRgU6</a>",1398203836

7630750,comment,7627135,7629078,2,0,lispm,,,"> When I &quot;create a language to solve a problem&quot; in, say, C++,<p>Most of the time you just add words to a language by adding verbs/adjectives/adverbs. It&#x27;s not a new language.<p>> One example is LOOP. It&#x27;s a macro, because Lisp without macros doesn&#x27;t have very good looping ability.<p>That&#x27;s backwards thinking.<p>LOOP is a macro, because macros are the way to implement code transformations in Lisp. Lisp has other iteration constructs, which are implemented as functions (MAP, REDUCE, ...).<p>Common Lisp is also its own compilation target. So at the very bottom there is only one iteration construct provided: GOTO. The rest are macros/functions on top of that. The language a compiler needs to understand is thus very small. The built-in extension mechanism then allows almost arbitrary code transformations. This is used by the language implementation AND the user. The user/developer has access to the same facility to implement code transformations in applications or libraries.<p>This is great for production, since you don&#x27;t have to wait for some committee or a benevolent dictator to implement the language feature you need. Instead of waiting for a new iteration facility for months or years, you can implement it in an afternoon. Productivity goes up. You don&#x27;t need to wait for tools generating code or more compact notations reducing boiler plate code - just implement it yourself. You also don&#x27;t need external preprocessors - just use Lisp. You can also debug/extend your code transformation using the same development tools, instead of maintaining external preprocessors. It also enables complex programs to have comparatively small code bases. Which often makes maintenance easier.<p>TL;DR: Lisp gives the user more expressive power and trusts them.",1398203793

Both statements are meaningless appeals to authority.<p>That was meant as a preface to a link that goes into much more detail.  There are technical reasons why object-oriented programming and the relational model do not map well to each other, the infamous object-relational mismatch.<p>> That&#x27;s your opinion, it&#x27;s certainly not a fact, and just as many disagree as would agree.<p>I suspect rather more would disagree than would agree with me, if we&#x27;re appealing to popularity.  But given that the wire protocols for most relational databases (yes, there are exceptions) primarily accept SQL, and all their optimizers are SQL-based, I don&#x27;t think this is actually as contentious a point as you believe it is.  It would be different if ORMs, like optimizing compilers, were able to take high-level information about your application and query structure and transform it into <i>better</i> SQL--but that is in fact what modern RDBMSes do themselves.  The more information you provide them, the better they are generally able to optimize your query.  In my experience, ORMs usually have the opposite effect--they have <i>less</i> specific information about how you want your data to be used than an SQL query would, so they generate SQL in smaller chunks which can&#x27;t be optimized as effectively.  ORMs also rarely support all the features of any but the simplest RDBMSes, which means that you end up having to drop down into SQL in many cases to take advantage of them.<p>> Secondly, ORM&#x27;s don&#x27;t stop you from using SQL where it&#x27;s beneficial, so ruling out the ORM because you don&#x27;t like it for some cases is throwing out the baby with the bath water.<p>Sure.  To continue the extremely apt compiler analog, I can also use inline assembly in any C program (not standard C, perhaps :)) for things I can&#x27;t do in C.  In both cases, every time I have to do that, it is a failure of the original language to allow me to do the things I want to do.  Any time I have to do that, I also have to independently verify safety, correctness, and platform independence, as well as correctness guarantees from the compiler (such as there are any in C).  And it requires domain-specific knowledge in an area that is dramatically outside my comfort zone.<p>If people were always having to drop in and out of inline assembly in C, it would have failed as a language long ago.  The fact that people are still using it is largely testament to the fact that <i>most</i> C instructions (on low optimization levels, anyway) translate fairly straightforwardly to assembly instructions, and can be optimized to incredible extents by the compiler using knowledge of entire functions (or even the whole program).  In performance-critical situations it is sometimes possible to do better than the compiler by dropping down into assembly, but the situations where you want to do that are <i>very</i> rare.   By contrast, ORMs can&#x27;t do any of those things--and I find myself dropping down into &quot;inline SQL&quot; so often that it&#x27;s become my default approach.  In sharp contrast to an optimizing compiler, the odds that even an SQL newcomer can produce better-optimized code than the ORM are shockingly high.<p>This is all not even going into the real reason I&#x27;ve given up on ORMs, which is that they are terrible at guaranteeing consistency of your data in concurrent situations.  In part out of deference to less-able databases, many ORMs will use transactions only begrudgingly and are often &quot;unsafe by default&quot; (using low levels of transactional isolation like REPEATABLE READ), which makes dropping into SQL not just a performance concern, but one of data integrity.  And if you don&#x27;t use a very strong, serializable isolation level, you have to worry about dealing properly with deadlocks, livelocks, and other sorts of concurrency failures, which are nearly impossible to reason about unless you explicitly acquire the locks.  I can&#x27;t stress enough how nightmarishly difficult this can be in a large application even without an ORM.  Adding an ORM to the equation basically means you spend half your time debugging the SQL, and the other half debugging the ORM.  Turning on serializable isolation would help a lot, if you can take the performance hit, but the reality is that for similar reasons to why ORMs can&#x27;t optimize queries very well, they&#x27;re also not able to reason effectively about transaction lifetimes.  Holding onto transactions longer than necessary is a great way to kill performance without substantially improving reliability.  In the meantime, the majority of people who assume ORMs are protecting them from concurrent data access issues are very likely to have subtle, nearly undetectable data races that lead to extremely problematic bugs down the line.<p>So ORMs provide neither safety, nor speed, nor (IMO) simplify the amount of information you have to keep in your head to reason effectively about your program&#x27;s behavior (since you have to know SQL anyway) over standard SQL.  But, you say,<p>> For standard CRUD operations, ORM&#x27;s are the best approach by far. Your hand written CRUD operations gain you nothing but extra work.<p>To me, this is the strangest idea of all.  Standard CRUD operations aren&#x27;t very verbose in SQL, either, and in a properly normalized database, it&#x27;s not likely that the majority of the time all you&#x27;re interested in is dealing with a single row from a single table in a single transaction (more often a view, perhaps, but if you&#x27;re using views you&#x27;re already well outside of familiar ORM territory).  I&#x27;ve personally found ORM behavior to be precisely what I actually wanted a pretty low percentage of the time, since even the smarter ORMs have a tendency to acquire data I don&#x27;t need (especially if you have foreign keys defined), make repeated unnecessary query requests, and insist upon jumping through elaborate hoops to enable common query patterns (try referencing a join table in Django that doesn&#x27;t have a unique ID--or worse, using a table that has a multicolumn primary key).  Your ORM only saves you work if you treat the database as a dumb store--a faster filesystem, basically.  There are certainly situations that call for dumb storage like that, of course, but in my experience there are not a whole lot of them.<p>What&#x27;s funny is that I used to completely agree with you.  I saw monstrous SQL queries eating up valuable database and developer resources, surrounded by custom-built frameworks (different ones depending on which developer was working on a portion of the application), with hand-written migrations[1] that were supposedly rerunnable but somehow never were in practice, and my reaction was, &quot;this is insane!  None of this logic should be in the database!  We should just use an ORM, and rely on the work of much smarter people who have surely reasoned about these problems much longer than we have, figured out best practices for data access, and encoded them into libraries.  To do otherwise is the worst kind of not-invented here syndrome and is clearly the result of DBAs clinging desperately to jobs that became irrelevant ten years ago.&quot;<p>The more I learned about databases, though, the more my tune started to change.  It turns out that (and yes, this is persistently my opinion :)) ORMs aren&#x27;t that at all.  The best practices for handling and accessing data are encoded into the RDBMSes themselves, and for technical reasons that I&#x27;ve since uncovered (for starters: catalog access), it is nearly impossible for the application to do better without itself becoming the main source of information about the data and metadata of the application.  I&#x27;m not saying that situations like the above are good--far from it--only that the solution isn&#x27;t an ORM.<p>SQL is an ugly, ugly language.  It&#x27;s insanely complex to parse and has baffling type coercion, it repeats the mistakes of past languages in including NULL and handles it in the worst way possible, it lacks (by default) many convenient structural types (but advanced systems like PostgreSQL get around this issue), and the promise of logical independence is often more myth than reality.  I would love for someone to come up with a better alternative.  But ORMs sure aren&#x27;t it.  They don&#x27;t solve any of SQL&#x27;s real problems, or even attempt to, and introduce a whole new set.  Their singular virtue is that syntactically they play nicely with your language of choice (if it happens to be object-oriented[2]), and that alone isn&#x27;t very compelling.<p>[1] Hand-written migrations are still usually a terrible idea, though RDBMSes with proper transactions can mitigate this somewhat.  This is somewhere where I still hold out hope that someone can come up with a much better solution.  However, I think good migration frameworks are somewhat orthogonal to the ORM problem, and ORMs can&#x27;t really help out much besides providing templates for schema diffs, since the hard part of a migration is actually migrating the data.<p>[2] I think a lot of the problems with ORMs are also problems with object-oriented programming in general.  A declarative or functional ORM framework would actually be able to function as a real replacement for SQL, at least in theory.  I&#x27;ve investigated such projects with interest, especially initiatives like SPARQL or the long-ongoing DataMapper2 project in Ruby (as well as abandoned good ideas like QUEL).  But so far, none of them seem to be able to gain significant traction, which is disappointing but perhaps expected.",1398202845

Can you explain what most software gets wrong about tagging?<p>First up, tagging is such a personal preference, from the highest level things like which fields to fill in (e.g. Album Artist), to small differences (e.g. do tracknumbers have a leading 0?), but also technical differences and compatibility choices (e.g. which tagging format? for MP3 you can have any of APE1, APE2, ID3v1 or ID3v2.{2,3,4})<p>Next these different tagging formats are in no way uniform:\nAPE2 and vorbiscomments are a string map with <i>some</i> <i>generally</i> agreed upon conventions,\nID3v1 has very limited fields,\nID3v2 is extremely over specified with a tag for everything in practice this just seems to mean that every program gets them wrong somewhere.\nThere are several other formats too...<p>Next, the tagging systems are very tricky to locate and modify: they all have various forms of headers, footers, padding, and odd storage formats.\ne.g. flac/vorbiscomments keep swapping back and forth betweeen little and big endien.\nThis is made mode complex by the various fighting container formats that have their own escaping, rules etc on top e.g. Ogg, MPEG, Matroska....<p>To make things even harder, things aren&#x27;t even correct without context. To take the duration issue from the article, VBR MP3 has no way to calculate duration without completely parsing the files: this takes too long for most files (reading the whole file into memory just to get the length???? no way!) so there&#x27;s all sorts of heuristics and weird headers (e.g. Xing)",1398202656

I have objections to a few of your decisions.<p>You count kitchens that can produce automeals, including making bacon, as a &quot;hit&quot;? I counted it as a miss. Where is there such a kitchen?<p>That is, &quot;heating water and converting it to coffee&quot; can&#x27;t be considered standalone, since percolators existed when Asimov made the prediction. Auto drip coffee (&quot;Mr. Coffee&quot;) is from the 1970s, so I think that&#x27;s a hit. But toasters existed in 1964, so &quot;toasting bread&quot; can&#x27;t mean just that. What device can I acquire for &quot;frying, poaching or scrambling eggs&quot;? And for making bacon?<p>I don&#x27;t think the increase of life expectancy in Japan, which is the only one with an average life expectancy of 85 or above, is due to &quot;mechanical devices to replace failing hearts and kidneys.&quot; That is, he emphasized <i>mechanical devices</i>, and not the general increase of life expectancy. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aging_of_Japan</a> attributes it instead to &quot;high education, devotion to raising healthy children, late marriage, increased participation of women in the labor force, small living spaces, education about the problems of overpopulation, and the high costs of child care and education.&quot;<p>So I would say that&#x27;s closer to a miss than a hit.<p>The reference to the &quot;worldwide propaganda drive in favor of birth control&quot; is interesting because I think the drive was much bigger in the 1960s/1970s with the Zero Population Growth movement. The 1980s saw the single child policy in place in China, and the 1970s saw the discourteously attempts as &quot;rational&quot; birth control in India. Instead, I think the current trend is towards female education and equal rights for women, which also ends up decreasing the number of children. So it&#x27;s hard to say if this is a &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot;, since I don&#x27;t know what Asimov meant.<p>You said that &quot;Synchronous satellites, hovering in space will make it possible for you to direct-dial any spot on earth&quot; is a hit. That&#x27;s a hard one to judge, but it&#x27;s technically incorrect. GOE systems like Inmarsat don&#x27;t reach every spot on earth, like the highest 30 or so degrees of latitude, or valleys. It&#x27;s LEO systems like Iridium that can provide global satellite coverage.<p>I&#x27;m curious about how you can quantify &quot;The lucky few who can be involved in creative work of any sort...&quot; as a hit. How much more is it true than it was in 1964? It seems to me that the richest people in the world (as a proxy for &#x27;true elite&#x27;) is not made up primarily by those who are best characterized as &quot;involved in creative work.&quot;",1398202111

One example is LOOP.<p>LOOP is a standard part of Common Lisp, so whatever it is it can&#x27;t be an example of how Lisp-as-it-comes isn&#x27;t good enough and you need macros to bring it up to standard.<p>> Now, does LOOP do more than a C-style for or while loop? I doubt it<p>In the sense in which a C-style <i>for</i> or <i>while</i> loop doesn&#x27;t do more than <i>goto</i>, you&#x27;re correct. Otherwise, of course you&#x27;re incorrect; LOOP does a lot more than <i>for</i> and <i>while</i> do. (Random example: (loop for i from 1 to 10 collect (* i i)) makes a list of squares. No instance of C&#x27;s <i>for</i> or <i>while</i> does anything like this.)<p>> Lisp <i>needs</i> macros to be usable.

Even an optimal implementation of the word solution would probably be quite a bit slower than a straightforward naive implementation.<p>The Z80 instruction set only supports word reads from constant addresses (but bytes can be read from an address specified in any register pair).  The Z80 has very few registers, so the more complicated algorithm will probably face register pressure.  Also, word comparison is only implemented for the HL, DE register pair unless you want to use an index register which requires an instruction prefix, which will make your code even slower.<p>But memory reads from an address in a register pair other than HL or an index register can only go to the accumulator register A, thus you&#x27;d need HL for both the comparison and the address.  So you need more instructions to save and restore HL.  (You can&#x27;t even use the fastest option EX DE,HL because DE is also needed for the comparison.)",1398201514

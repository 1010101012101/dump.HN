Me and my team of 12 engineers have a temporary HQ in Central Europe, and we are now looking for a permanent base to work from. We are choosing a new home, a country that will allow us to develop our projects with privacy and freedom of speech in mind.<p>Our team includes 6 ACM champions and 6 winners of other programming contests. These guys made it possible for Telegram Messenger to gather 40 million registered users worldwide just within 8 months after its launch. Several members of this team, including my brother, were crucial in making VKontakte what it is today â€” the only social network that defeated Facebook in an open local market. We are now going to build our next project, a mobile social network.<p>What country or city do you think would suit us best? Please feel free to comment below. To give you an idea of our preferences, we dislike bureaucracy, police states, big governments, wars, socialism and excessive regulation. We like freedoms, strong judicial systems, small governments, free markets, neutrality and civil rights.<p>P.S. If you happen to represent a government that meets our criteria, you are welcome to share ideas with me at durov2016@gmail.com.",1398329372

This reminds me of a certain aspect of plane crash investigations. When a plane explodes at high altitude and the occupants are thrown out, the force exerted by the atmosphere due to falling can be sufficient to rip off clothes, so sometimes the victims bodies can be found on the ground naked.<p><a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/news/k2-the-final-hours-1597003.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.independent.co.uk/news/k2-the-final-hours-1597003...</a>",1398328794

If 10 Unix guys sit together and set up 2 servers for 20-30 personal mailboxes, the time and money might be worth it.

By controlling this rate, the Fed can effectively control how much excess reserves they have, thus having a large impact on the rate of inflation. Having said that, it is a massive and unprecedented amount of excess reserves. If something goes terribly wrong in their exit strategy (and/or the velocity of money picks up unexpectedly) then the worry would be high inflation, not deflation.<p>EDIT: I believe you meant if inflation kicked in then the flood of free money would discontinue. That would be accurate as interest rates would rise and QE would most certainly be off the table. Deflation fears is what set QE into high-gear in the first place ;)",1398326589

The biggest stumbling block was the landlord (a trust fund) dragged its feet and eventually denied my sublease application at the end of the 3 months.  With a couple friends, we had been operating semi-discreetly during this time, but didn't redo the banner outside and didn't do much marketing.<p>Since we left, it's been taken over by the boutique next door.

1938655,comment,1935846,1935846,0,0,mkramlich,,,"Historically I'm not a guy who likes ""fancy"" note-taking or TODO-tracking tools. I tend to prefer things like vi or TextMate. That said, I played with WorkFlowy last night and I really liked it. I think it provides a very useful kind of tool experience. Scratchs a useful itch. I was surprised. The only thing that I don't like is I'm uncomfortable with it being a webapp hosted by some company. I'd much much much prefer it if I could run a native app version of WorkFlowy, with my data stored in a file on my own computer. And if it's stored in a file(s) that I control, then I could, say, use something like DropBox or git or rsynch or TimeMachine or TrueCrypt or whatever to make sure that data is shared or backed up or encrypted exactly how I want or need. Right now if the WF company goes away or I have no connectivity, I can't access my data. (I'm aware of their ""copy-and-paste out"" feature but that doesn't address this particular problem, and is hacky and will be prone to having out-of-date data stored in your backup cache. And it's too manual.) This is my only negative with it so far. Otherwise, I think the UI is great and I think it's really useful for certain cases. Possibly a killer app for those use cases. Turn this into a native app for Mac with all my data stored locally wherever I wish, with no connectivity requirements, and you can put me down for a purchase. Great work!<p>I also want to throw a shout out to Notational Velocity. First time I've heard of it was in this discussion thread. Just played with it now. Also like it. Nice use cases supported. I can see this really being useful. It's a different beast than WorkFlowy so I don't think they compete, they are complementary or orthogonal tools, at best. I could see using both. Couple advantages I see with NV are (1) native app, (2) open source, and (3) it stores your data locally where you control it and own it. NV does <i>not</i> have the cool collapsible hierarchical bullet point UI mechanism that WorkFlowy has, however, so again they don't really compete directly or scratch the same itch. The 100%-keyboard-drivability aspect is awesome and very useful. I wish I could control the font size, the default is uncomfortably small.<p>Anyway, glad I discovered this thread, and I'll be adding both of these tools to my toolbox going forward. Kudos to the folks behind both.",1290635659

Yes there's a lot of VC money in California, yes tech companies choose to have their headquarters here and yes that pumps up the overall GDP.  But that doesn't negate all the other problems we have.<p>As anyone knows you can make a ton of money and it doesn't matter if you spend more than you make.  Right now California is doing just that to the tune of $20 billion a year.<p>Beyond that he is using twisted numbers.  For example he uses the Tax Foundation's tax burden index but the Tax Foundation themselves say that isn't a valid comparison metric because that calculation doesn't include local taxes and...<p>“some states accomplish at the local level what other states accomplish at the state level, so a degree of comparability is lost as a result.”<p>He also uses a lot of first level thinking.  Like justifying the high pay given to public sector employees by quoting the high cost of living but not asking why there's such a high cost of living.  Or saying how Google, Apple and Facebook all choose not to move from California without mentioning they've all chosen to build their data centers elsewhere.<p>Like I said people do make this out to be more than it is.

If I issue a billion shares and offer you stock options at a $0.10 strike price you can't really expect the company to grow that 25x .  It's an entirely different matter if there are 50,000 shares.<p>You may be assuming that the strike price is fairly pegged at a real value of the company and thus you can make assumptions about real growth of the company in terms of multiple.  Short of public markets, this is always a questionable assumption, but in the case of new startups it is almost completely arbitrary.  When you start a new one, there is no reason to differentiate between choices in the number of shares varying by a factor of 10,000x or more, and strike prices are almost as flexible.<p>Perhaps the best reason to pick any number is to pick a large one because of the (irrational) psychological impact that your large absolute number of shares will have in option grants.<p>I suppose this emerges out of people's naive appreciation of public markets.  Smaller companies often have stock prices in the teens.  Mature, stable companies tend to hold prices closer to a hundred.  Blockbusters like Google go to 400!  Etc.  These prices are managed with splits and have little to do with the return captured by owners of the stock, but people looking at it from the outside sometimes miss this.

Many of the peripheral keys are very small for my Western fingers, although I feel I'm getting used to them already. It's fanless, and has only flash storage, so it's eerily silent and apparently gets up to 8 hours of battery life. The trackpad doesn't have enough vertical space to be comfortable, and there are neither function keys nor a delete key, although there are a whole row of special keys which presumably can be xmodmappped.<p>The online reviews mention that Android provides a less than elegant interface with the lack of a touchscreen, and I agree; I was planning to install a Linux or BSD OS on it all along. As I understand it, that's pretty tricky; should make for a nice weekend project :-)<p>As for why there aren't more of them around already, my best guess is that OEMs don't want to piss off Wintel by selling what is effectively a PC which doesn't use their platform, for fear of losing the discounts and rebates they get when they do.

I'd hope to think that anyone who is designing a product for their end user would be Abel to recognize that, but I suspect that is a bit too optimistic.<p>Although I think splitting the kernel into separate products for different applications is a problem as well. What it really comes down to at that point is where are you planning on taking your product?<p>Are you satisfied with a big market with large customers, or do you really want a huge market with nearly unlimited small customers. f Linux really wants to be on the desktop, they will have to moderate some of their features that are enterprise only to make the desktop experience better.",1185461647

I think I'm going to be engrossed in the rest of Norvig's site/articles for a long while now.<p>That article included a link to the video lectures of the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs by A&S themselves, given to HP employees back in the 80's: <p><a href=""http://www.archive.org/details/mit_ocw_sicp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archive.org/details/mit_ocw_sicp</a><p>",1185460573

I was the outside computer consultant for an accounting firm that merged with a larger firm, I was assured from day one that I was going to stay in my position. Five days after the integration was complete they changed the administrators password and told me that they never give that password to outside consultants.<p>... and that's how I lost a client I had been working with for 10 years ...<p>The previous owner, now a partner, had no control over my status and was told that the issue would be brought up in committee. This was the first of a line of major issues that happened like this.<p>The bottom line on this is if you like the way your company runs, don't put someone else in charge of it.",1185460265
36844,comment,36843,36843,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"This is an exceptionally good talk.<p>What is especially interesting is in the QA session, we hear about how dysfunctional team communication is at Google.  The current practice is an email question is sent to the entire team on a project of 20+ people.  Then people play the waiting game to see who will reply first to the question, etc.  The result is that googlers get hundreds to 500+ emails internally that they have to cope with - a productivity nightmare.  Also one questioner pointed out, in spite of the email information firehose, critical information is not distributed.  She mentions the example of a random encounter with someone at lunch, and finding out that a person in NY is working on a very similar project to hers and she having no clue about it.<p>Also interesting is that Google hosts a seminar series by David Allen on ""Getting Things Done"" for their staff on a regular basis.  I guess they are trying to start solving the problem.",1185459720

36841,comment,36684,36684,0,0,pg,,,"It may be the best answer is to change the question.  Why do people measure LOC?  Because they're trying to measure the productivity of programmers.  Why are they doing that?  Largely to decide how to reward them.  So that is the ultimate problem.  But it goes away if the programmers work in smaller groups, in the form of startups, because then the market decides how to reward them.<p>So odd as may seem, the answer to the question of how to measure LOC is: startups!",1185459482

2) Lower capital gains taxes to let big wins offset losses for VCs
3) Less government involvement in companies. It was mentioned recently how governments giving hundreds of millions to companies will not replace google.",1185458510

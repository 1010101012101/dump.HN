I used the same tactic when Generics came up. I hadn&#x27;t any problems with it. The beginner can become a better programmer by reading the code. Now I am in a state where I can say: &quot;this shouldn&#x27;t be implemented that way&quot;. Which is completely different and grounds in being Java my native language.<p>I have casual encounters with Haskell since two years now. Library code is still hard to grok. Don&#x27;t get me wrong: I like Haskell very much and I am pretty sure that its a decent language to write security critical code in, but I think this is still a problem for many beginners out there. I very rarely stumble on something and say: &quot;hey, that&#x27;s cool, I will use that in my code&quot;.

To worsen things, working class students (who have a higher probability of being a dropout) also attribute bad performance in school with lack of talent rather than lack of effort more often than middle class students. A treatment in a school context that has been shown to be both sustainable and effective is continuous feedback on the <i>relative improvement</i> in archivements of the specific student (school marks comparing the individual performance to the class usually make the percieved talent-mark correlation worse as the high-performing students often didn&#x27;t need much effort to get their marks). Luckily this is one of the seldom cases where a treatment has stronger effects on the students with learning problems compared to the high performers, too (thats usually a big problem in pedagogy).<p>[1] Leaving out the the sociological context.

Getting a performance boost (or not having to interop) in a level editor, texture tool etc. will likely be welcome.<p>The tradeoff between safety/convenience/productivity vs. performance of C# vs C++ for example can&#x27;t be motivated at the moment, and probably won&#x27;t be with SIMD. Writing .NET code with deterministic performance is hard, so hard that C# is no more convenient than C++.

Also, most of the soldiers take their rifle home and store it, even pass it to their sons.

The government is seen as the people&#x27;s employee. The guns at home, the banking secrecy and the direct democracy are in many ways instantiations of this thinking.

There has to be a default in one direction or the other.<p>The default is to send a null value in the header meaning that no intent has been expressed, that's not arbitrary.<p>> That, and many users will use IE10 knowing that it ships with DNT pre-enabled. To ignore this is totally immoral and unethical. This is totally shameful.<p>Most users will have no idea what DNT is, nor will they bother to switch the flag. MS setting it to do not track by default undermines the effort being put into the standard. No one is going to comply with a voluntary standard if one of the largest browser vendors turns it on by default.",1351295650

And later I added that the Bitcoin experiment will also contribute to greater understanding of attack surfaces and online crime. Many of the ideas about how to mine Bitcoins, store Bitcoins, and trade with Bitcoins as a medium of exchange illustrate both the strengths and weaknesses of any other medium of exchange in a world full of human beings. Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of early online discussions in the 1990s of online payment systems such as PayPal, and the arguments beforehand that PayPal wouldn't have to invest a lot of time and effort (as it eventually did) building defenses against theft and fraud. If a weakness in a system is attached to a lot of money, the way to bet is to bet that someone will go looking for that weakness, even if you haven't thought of it.<p>This prompts a question for all the security-knowledgeable persons who participate here on Hacker News, a question once asked of the inventor of Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). How expensive do you think it would be for the United States National Security Agency (or a comparable organization from another national government) to crack a Bitcoin store, given that we know that some Bitcoin caches have already been cracked? And if the organization storing Bitcoin data held personal bank account data too, how attractive a target might it be to thieves?",1351293983

If you just use the address of an object for the hash, that has a implication to performance.  If you choose a cryptographic function, that has another implication.  If you use something like cityhash, that has yet another.<p>If you use rehashing or a linked list to handle collisions that has another impact on the performance depending on what is going on.<p>If you choose to auto grow the hash table upon a certain number of collisions, this is another thing you have to worry about.<p>The process of lookup might use a precalculated cache of the hash code calculation if it is expensive and sacrifice some memory for this storage.<p>My point of all these examples is that the simple runtime of the collection isn't the whole story and lots of crap can happen under the covers.  We stand on the shoulders of giants, but we have to know what weaknesses and strengths we are exploiting.  While just picking the right data (or wrong) structure makes a huge impact, you need a lifetime of experience to really know what matters, and what the trade off of one or another is in a given scenario.

Analogue dynamic range is only limited by the noise floor of the cable and the resolution of the DACs/ADCs.

Only an idealized analog signal of infinite precision doesn't have a limited range.<p><i>After the DACs, the signal will likely go through another pre-amp, then main amp in the sound system, then some analogue filters, then loudspeakers. All these are analogue and not usually limiting the dynamic range (though they will add some distortion).</i><p>Precisely. So that's why keeping the signal at as high a level as possible without clipping all the way through the pipeline and only limiting at the end is an advantage. All those stages have their own noise floor. Several other people have mentioned on the thread that this is also the general recommendation for audio work.<p><i>Finally, the signal will enter a room with noise aplenty, which will limit the effective dynamic range of the signal significantly.

The average package will occupy the slot for a day before it is picked up. This gives a max revenue of $40/day/box, or $1200/month/box. Slash that figure in half because it is impossible to have all slots occupied simultaneously all the time, and you get $600/month/box.<p>If they can turn this into a profitable business, they are truly visionaries that see what others cannot.",1351292763

Who has gone to jail for ripping a Blu-Ray to their iPad?  Nobody.  Therefore, we don't really know if it's illegal or not.  The copyright office has an <i>opinion</i> and have decided not to specifically make the act legal (which is the only authority they have).  Fair use, copyright law, ""the right of the people to be secure in their ... effects against unreasonable searches..."" are all part of the legality equation here, and until this is tested in court, we won't know what is or is not legal.<p>As far as I can see, the cat is already out of the bag and people don't care what the law is.  They <i>can</i> space shift, and will.  End of story.  (Incidentally, it seems that it's perfectly legal to space-shift pirated media.  So maybe just get that instead?)<p>(It's kind of like how pot is illegal federally, but many states allow people to grow, buy, and sell it.  Yup, it's illegal.  Too bad nobody cares.)",1351292582

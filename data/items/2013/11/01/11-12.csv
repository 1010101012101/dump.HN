I keep saying &quot;LooseProof&quot; in an effort to make the syllables use the same vowel sound (English US speaker).<p>The web page is nice, but this stage in my life I feel like I&#x27;ve got too much stuff.  Losing it is one convenient way to rid myself of some of the mass.  The things I really care about aren&#x27;t conducive to stickers ... I think my wife and kids would object, but maybe I could find somewhere inconspicuous.  Everything else I&#x27;d hate to lose I have redundancy for (family photos are on Flash drives in multiple locations).<p>Maybe my definition of &quot;Love&quot; has become more refined than it used to be?",1383307191

In the 1950s they kicked my mother&#x27;s uncle out for defending the rights of the Communist Party USA to peaceably assemble, and today I am really not happy with the way they look at religious liberty.<p>The problem with religious liberty and the ACLU is that they seem to look at it entirely as if it is just a piece of anti-discrimination law and nothing more.  For this reason they came down 100% on the wrong side of Hosana Tabor v. EEOC, and have generally opposed religious liberty when it conflicts with other anti-discrimination agendas they push.  But the First Amendment is not just another piece of anti-discrimination law, and it must have more force than the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Civil Rights Act.  The unwillingness to really defend religious freedom outside of the antidiscrimination context is one reason I can&#x27;t back the ACLU over the EFF.",1383307059

If one does not explicitly exist, then it doesn&#x27;t practically exist, either.

Basically you could select any version, click &quot;Install&quot; button and follow the logs in real time.<p>Behind the scenes it was a decentralized continuous delivery system. Very cool stuff, highly automated. Reduced a lot of work and sped up development cycles from months to minutes. Served quite a large software development organization (1000+). I think we had 1000 servers in 5 datacenters around the globe.<p>Nowdays I&#x27;m working on an open source version of that system, it&#x27;s still missing few critical features but hopefully I&#x27;ll get the first release out next spring.<p>btw, I&#x27;m looking for projects/contacts that would be interested in trying out how the system would fit their needs.",1383306900

I don&#x27;t even know how to guess. A few hundred?

We have enough idiots over here mistaking the autobahn for a racetrack. I&#x27;ll tell you a secret: It&#x27;s not. People get killed here just as in the USA, for example the accident when a professional test driver for Mercedes cannonballed his prototype car into a previous accident. Despite darkness and bad visibility he was going beyond 190km/h and impacted with 170km/h, killing the driver of another car - despite the fact that that person was already out of their car. Two people that were out on the autobahn trying to help other victims of the crash narrowly escaped death. I remember that quite well since I passed there like half an hour before.<p>If you want a race, take your car to the Nürburgring for a weekend. It&#x27;s still legendary and still dangerous, but at least people know what they signed up for.

Does it make them use the app more (for example, to seek more connections and friends now that they see it&#x27;s effective for meeting new people), or less (they took the conversation elsewhere and their social needs were met for now).<p>Just my $0.02.

Making sure that we would be unable to assert these patents to defend Android — and having us pay for the privilege — must have seemed like an ingenious strategy to them. We didn&#x27;t fall for it.<p>Ultimately, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened, forcing Microsoft to sell the patents it bought and demanding that the winning group (Microsoft, Oracle, Apple, EMC) give a license to the open-source community, changes the DoJ said were “necessary to protect competition and innovation in the open source software community.” This only reaffirms our point: Our competitors are waging a patent war on Android and working together to keep us from getting patents that would help balance the scales.&quot;</i>",1383304361

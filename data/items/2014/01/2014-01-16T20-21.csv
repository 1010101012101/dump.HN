To help spot high risk individuals and offer more rapid responses or particular interventions.  To help develop and implement more data standards for social workers or court systems or welfare programs.  To help integrate food stamp programs into IRS and State tax data so people don&#x27;t spend hours filling out the same information when they need to sign up for help and make a mistake on a form that causes weeks or months of delays.  The amount of wasted time in setting up and delivering services to people is astounding.

Aka never say never.<p>Let me illustrate: first of all, I did not choose that platform directly (though if I could, I would, it is <i>very</i> hard to beat Visual Studio once you get into it), the branch we&#x27;re in did. This is not some allround web/mobile app but a dedicated high performance desktop application that targets eg the automotive industry. And it&#x27;s commercial. So if a big player (think Bosh/Siemens) asks you for software that runs on XP, you deliver it, simple as that. The other option is loosing them as a client, which would be about the worst mistake you can make in a startup you have to live from. And by far the easiest way to deliver what we need is by using Visual Studio, don&#x27;t even try to deny that.<p>Btw another thing about automotive and other huge industries is the typical life-cycle of a product (which in turn is used to produce other, erm, products) is waaaay longer then your typical application. Hence, XP still kinda lives there in some places. Also a lot of the hardware used there is built to last, e.g. your typical National Instruments ADC easily lasts 25 years. Which sometimes leads to (sometimes rather bad) decisions like &#x27;well, then the software should keep on running for 10 years straight from now with no updates.

And that puzzled me, and prompted me to read the Wikipedia article after reading Schneier&#x27;s blog post submitted here, because I had been told years ago, when I definitely did not have the appropriate level of clearance for a SCIF (as I have never had and probably never will have) that I did have access to a special hearing room for one of the congressional intelligence oversight committees. I was inside the room at the time, with foreign visitors. (I was there as the interpreter for the foreign visitors.) I saw the hearing room back in the 1980s, as I recall, as part of a people-to-people program funded by the United States government that brought over people from other countries to look at how society works in the United States. The look inside the secure room was part of learning about how intelligence agencies in the United States are overseen by Congress. It was represented to us that when the room in the Capitol was closed up, it was impervious to any then-known form of surveillance. So now what Schneier says has me puzzled about whether or not there is any level of secure room between what he calls a &quot;regular room&quot; and a room that a United States citizen can only enter with a very high level of security clearance. It seems to me that there ought to be some kind of in-between room like that, precisely for meetings like the one Schneier just had.

Here&#x27;s my cynical take on a back of the napkin recipe for political change:<p>1. Call, write, tweet, and facebook your representatives, both local and federal, and tell them what you think- be sure to inflate your credentials and threaten to give money/votes/accolades to their political enemies. For bonus points, tell their enemies the same thing. For even more bonus points, run as a candidate yourself.<p>2. Write/speak/act out in the public sphere, make sure to get as much attention as possible and to be moderately vitriolic and abundantly populist in your rhetoric. Use only words, concepts, and rhetoric that a dim 9th grader would understand.<p>3. Join a physical protest- if there isn&#x27;t one near you, it&#x27;s your job to start one. I&#x27;d keep it nonviolent if I were you. I know that this isn&#x27;t the cup of tea for most HN readers, but there&#x27;s no way around it: physical presence matters, and the numbers of people who have protested surveillance thus far have been extremely paltry. We don&#x27;t have the luxury of waiting for someone else to do it for us.<p>4. Convince your less-enlightened friends and relatives to do items 1-5, or at least be terrified of the government.<p>5.

The average user isn&#x27;t going to bother with the steps you mentioned. Just because it can be <i>made</i> to work doesn&#x27;t mean its an acceptable solution for the average user.<p>Look at it this way - lets say I made, for example a fingerprint scanner for Windows, and you wanted to use it for Linux. I could say &quot;yes! it works on Linux! You just have to write your own C driver!&quot; You can clearly see this isn&#x27;t an acceptable solution as writing a driver is needlessly complex especially if you don&#x27;t have the proper documentation.<p>Now you might argue that writing a driver and searching Google for pipelight are in way two different leagues - but to the <i>average</i> user, asking them to do that might as well be the same as asking them to write their own driver.<p>Even the instructions you gave are confusing. Follow the instructions for your distro? Wait, you expect the <i>average</i> user to use the command line? What distro am I using? Linux? Should I follow AV Linux?<p>Because you most likely work with computers everyday on a professional level, you are vastly overstating the know-how of the average computer user. So yes, Netflix does work on Linux - if you are a wiz enough to get it up and working. The average user? No.",1389903103

This business model would have never become popular if people exercised a modicum of forethought about which technologies to adopt, but knowledgeable techies ignored their reservations when they saw a chance for social acceptance by making software easy for &quot;normal people&quot;. So the datamining companies really wish to promote the idea that the NSA has transgressed rather than let people realize their business foundations are fundamentally anti-user.<p>3. Governmentally, nothing is going to actually change. Perhaps we&#x27;ll get some resignations, specific named-program decommissioning, more laws to be skirted by individual analysts, and other such feel-good surface changes. But the critters deciding anything know that this is just the ugly business of how spying has worked and will continue to work, and that the NSA was just unluckily exposed.<p>4.

That&#x27;s the same as issuing a press release.<p>Absolutely not. Keeping your (nominal) overseers appraised of your activities is not the same thing at all as informing the whole world in front of cameras.

But this is countered by opinting out that the NSA can&#x27;t be trusted with the secrets it <i>has</i>.",1389902489

A company that doesn&#x27;t make money is useless to it&#x27;s shareholders, and typically shareholders vote to make sure a company makes as much money as possible.

No one is arguing it could be done much better, but right from the start it should have been obvious that it&#x27;s a problem without a good solution at all. The problem just shouldn&#x27;t have been solved!<p>It should have been two (or even three) different airframes sharing engines, electronics.<p>Some craft wouldn&#x27;t need full stealth, some wouldn&#x27;t need stovl.

What is that saying about people yelling the loudest when the differences are smallest or something? It strikes me as some sort of compensation mechanism. Most of our code sucks, just really, honestly sucks. The number of software projects in history that have been done to the best capabilities that time and money would allow is an appallingly low number. Almost every software development effort involves a disturbing amount of half-assery. The amazing thing is that despite this it&#x27;s possible to produce things that work and have considerable value. But there are so many ways we could do better, I wish more people would concern themselves with that rather than trying to ride the bleeding-edge of coolness or to prop up their personal identity as a &quot;legitimate programmer&quot; by playing the exclusion game.",1438419186

Not just crypto, though that is the most prominent one but Middleware, form protection, upload handling, traffic monitoring, authentication and caching without blowing up the RAM, etc.<p>I also don&#x27;t think your app would get more scalable. You might have less code overall in your app but how well documented is it? Is it as well documented as the frameworks? For whom one of the most important concerns is usability and making sure others understand the code? \nOverall I doubt your code would be very readable. Many people write awful code and I doubt there&#x27;s a lot of in depth code review in most companies, requires too many resources.<p>Another point when it comes to scalability is interfaces. Interfaces to  talk to other instances, interfaces for pluggable modules, interfaces for the database, interfaces to different frontends. If you want your app to be scalable and possibly distributed and/or extensible you need good interfaces and programmers are also notoriously bad at designing those. (That&#x27;s why JavaScript is the way it is)\nThe only reason why those of frameworks are somewhat workable, is because they made a lot of mistakes before and learned from it (mostly). \nGood interfaces require constant and incremental improvement.

I saw a lot of people who were really insecure in other areas of life besides the area where their skill applies.

Firstly, there are hard limits on localStorage, then there is the issue that nodes go offline really often (whenever someone closes their browser/tab) and therefore it&#x27;s highly volatile - You would have to replicate data across nodes like crazy to reduce the odds of data loss (the bandwidth use would be massive with loads of duplicate data all over the place). Plus you still need a server to do the signaling to coordinate consensus across all the nodes. Also, there are security implications when storing data inside other peoples&#x27; browsers (though this isn&#x27;t relevant in this specific case).<p>There has been some hype around using WebRTC for storing data only on the client-side using consensus algorithms like RAFT, but given the constraints which most browsers have and the massive amount of complexity required to get this working, it&#x27;s really not worthwhile.<p>I don&#x27;t think these browser constraints will be lifted anytime soon - There are some very good reasons for having them in the first place - For one, most people don&#x27;t want their computers&#x27; CPU, memory and their internet bandwidth to be used up to process other people&#x27;s stuff.",1438417188

I accept it, even if I disagree; you can do the same.<p>In any case, opinion how should people be programming (e.g. use macros), is <i>ideology</i>. One ideology can be, in practice, better than the other, but it still is an ideology. Python tries to avoid the controversial ones and only adds those that have significant consensus.<p>> What is needed is to promote such discipline instead of spreading lies that &quot;macros are dangerous&quot;.<p>You should be a little more honest with yourself and admit there is a grain of truth in it.

So unless D or Rust have macros, you end up with Julia and Clojure.<p>Second, I am talking about languages used in the industry; in the 80s, macros were in widely used languages such as assembler, C, PL/I, Common Lisp, SAS, M4, Forth.. It&#x27;s simply not what we see today. It may change in the future, but given the general trend in programming languages to add constraints (smartly) rather than remove them (I mentioned FP), I think it&#x27;s unlikely (just to remind you - I actually like macros, at least in CL).<p>Finally, you can do (equivalent of) template metaprogramming in Python (mostly, templates are way to circumvent the type system, which is already done deal in Python). You can also define DSLs in Python pretty easily, especially with __call__() methods. The bottom line, for me, is that Python has lots of small niceties (mostly in the standard library) that collectively overweight the advantages of macros.",1438416405

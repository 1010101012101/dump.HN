If you have poor intensity resolution, information is lost and the lens errors cannot be corrected anymore. In low light, the signal to noise ratio will lead to poor intensity resolution, and the lens errors become irreversible.<p>A better sensor will only get you so far; since light is quantized (a ray consists of individual photons), there are physical limits to the intensity resolution possible at low light.<p>Once information is lost, there is no way to recover it.

Every time. I force myself to walk the stairs and down a glass of tomato juice, and in almost an instant, am up and running.<p>I don&#x27;t think that it being really easy is the point here. And part of me always wants to stay up long and nerd around. For me, taking control, getting over that hump is never easy and takes a good bit of discipline, for the lack of a better word.

For example, almost half the active military from 2002-2005 was at one point deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan [1]. We just couldn&#x27;t have had those wars without 1/10th the military without significantly changing how we wage war. At some level, it&#x27;s possible that we could be equally violent with a tiny fraction of the military manpower and budget, and the same is true of, say, the Netherlands. But it would be wildly impractical, so in practice countries like the Netherlands don&#x27;t do it. We&#x27;re violent because our budget makes being violent easy for us.<p>> Most of the money goes toward hardware, which means engineers, construction, and the like<p>I need to be convinced of two things there. First, that it&#x27;s actually true. The two largest categories (which together make up a solid majority) are &quot;Operations and maintenance&quot; and &quot;Military personnel&quot; [2]. I don&#x27;t understand what&#x27;s in that first category, but since there are separate categories for procurement, R&D, and construction, it&#x27;s not those (education does presumably fall under &quot;military personnel&quot;). (In general, I&#x27;ve always found good numbers on exactly how the military spends its money hard to come by.)<p>And second, I&#x27;m very skeptical that as far as job programs go, the military is a very good one compared to other ways of spending that money. To begin with, the military doesn&#x27;t create nearly as many useful things. Designing and building bombers might have ancillary positive effects in terms of R&D and employment, but the bombers themselves are only useful for bombing, and mostly just sit around and being ready to bomb things. But what if we made really fancy civilian aircraft instead? It would have those effects and we&#x27;d end up with all these really useful planes! Similarly, a lot of the infrastructure the military builds is in far-away countries, or is of transient or at least limited use. Soldiers are getting paid and engineers are building, but they&#x27;re not really adding much value. Compare that to building bridges or researching solar panel technology.<p>Next, the primary reason for having make-work programs is that the people receiving all the money are also consumers, meaning the money is fed back into the economy and stimulating further economic activity. The military is terrible at that because a lot of the money is actually spent overseas developing other country&#x27;s economies.<p>All of that is to say: assuming we want to spend a few billion dollars on construction, training, R&D, and personnel, why do we prefer to spend through the military instead through other stuff? My guess is that we do it that way because we&#x27;ve always done it that way, and not because it&#x27;s optimal or even rational.<p>[1] <a href=""http://usmilitary.about.com/od/terrorism/a/deploymentrates.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usmilitary.about.com/od/terrorism/a/deploymentrates.h...</a>

In the past, in the event of catastrophic injury, you declared bankruptcy and the hospital ate the bill.  Now, in theory, some insurance plan will be on the hook for those costs.<p>Because of the way co-pays and deductibles work, you have to be in the top 10% or maybe 15% of health care spenders before you even break even with what you&#x27;ve paid in on a Bronze plan (by far the most popular self-purchased plan).  Catastrophic injury type health insurance has been available for awhile, at reasonable rates, unless you had a serious pre-existing condition.

Employer-sponsored health insurance was essentially an accident of WWII wage and price controls (source: <a href=""http://www.nber.org/bah/2009no2/w14839.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nber.org/bah/2009no2/w14839.html</a>). Because health benefits were exempt from WWII-era wage controls, employers used them to attract employees. Furthermore, because the employer contribution is paid in pre-tax dollars (i.e., employer-sponsored health insurance is effectively subsidized by the government), it became an attractive way to provide greater overall compensation to employees than otherwise possible.<p>However, the issue of coupling employment to insurance was quickly apparent, which is why we have COBRA (since 1985), but even that is more of a patch than a fix. Regardless of the merits or demerits of Obamacare, uncoupling employment from insurance is (theoretically) a positive outcome for everyone, whether one is an entrepreneur or not. We&#x27;re already seeing firms shift their cheapest plans to exchanges (<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304795804579097422592424860.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142405270230479580457909...</a>).

The 34MP pictures though are a different beast. I took a picture of some work colleagues in the office the other day and was able to zoom in and read the place names on a map pinned to the wall a few feet behind them. I took a picture of a crowd that was gathered across the street and was able to zoom in later and crop out some decent (slightly grainy - but not awful) looking photos of people chatting as if I were stood a few feet away. The detail really is amazing compared to anything (phone based) that I&#x27;ve seen before.<p>I have no idea what half the options on my 1020&#x27;s camera do, but having the option of a manual focus slider is great too.

Ballot initiatives just involve an up-or-down vote on specific issues in isolation, without involving the population directly in the responsibilities of day-to-day governing, so, as in California, you get an incoherent patchwork of spending commitments and limits on tax increases. A better example of direct democracy might be something like participatory budgeting.

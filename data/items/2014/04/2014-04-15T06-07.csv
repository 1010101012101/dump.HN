But they replaced 90% of the victorians, they flattened the hills, they built freeways everywhere. San Francisco was spared that, largely because the people fought back, and now the people want to fight to preserve what was saved.<p>I&#x27;m of mixed-feelings about it.

I like a lot of the companies here. I like the weather. But if I had no obligations, I would move tomorrow. I&#x27;ve lived in a half-dozen states and two countries. The state and local governments here are the second-worst I&#x27;ve lived under.[1] SF is unbelievable. There are insane violent vagrants roaming around Market street and the Tenderloin. MUNI is a nightmare, and BART is noisy enough to cause hearing damage.[2] Almost any public area is extremely dirty. One can&#x27;t walk more than a block without encountering the smell of waste.<p>The biggest thing preventing tech workers from moving is that some interactions simply must be done in-person. Often this requirement is due to culture, not technological limitations. Still, there are significant advantages to in-person interactions. People are much more likely to pay attention to each other. There can be interesting and beneficial chance encounters. And of course, the likelihood of anything getting recorded or leaked is lower.<p>I think that as remote work becomes more feasible (both technologically and culturally), more tech workers will move out of the bay area. There are simply too many incentives to leave.<p>1. The worst being Guam, which couldn&#x27;t keep electricity running for more than 12 hours a day. Great beaches, though.<p>2.

This means that tests can be more focused on logic errors rather than standard book keeping. If you look at the example set by the rust repository itself (<a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/</a>), it is heavily tested and every single PR (<a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pulls"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/rust/pulls</a>) is reviewed before merging. This discipline definitely filters down into third party libraries.",1397541920

Mislabeled by some detractors as socialist or radical in the Marxist tradition, San Francisco’s progressivism is concerned with consumption more than production, residence more than workplace, meaning more than materialism, community empowerment more than class struggle. Its first priority is not revolution but protection — protection of the city’s environment, architectural heritage, neighborhoods, diversity, and overall quality of life from the radical transformations of turbulent American capitalism.</i>",1397541902

This is a plausible mechanism, even if it&#x27;s wrong, and should be engaged with.<p>The key thing is the margin for &quot;even more expensive&quot;.  Fundamentally, yes, development makes cities more valuable / expensive, <i>in aggregate</i> (after all, that&#x27;s why cities exist in the first place).  The key thing is how many units that value is spread out over.  If you tear down a slum and replace it with $1M condos in a supply-constrained market, rents will rise.<p>But, there are a limited number of people who can afford to buy 7-figure condos, and it is possible to build enough housing to saturate that demand all the way down the curve.  If you&#x27;re actually able to tear down a single-family unit and replace it with 4-unit low-rise apartments, and rent / sell them at a decent price since people want to move into the city, and <i>all your competitor landlords can do the same</i>, you&#x27;ll see more units, more total dollars going to landlords, and lower prices per unit.<p>The key thing is to make it cheap to build.  Excessive regulation of the kind the article talks about often does the exact opposite - they make it so you can build, eventually, but it&#x27;s only worthwhile if you can be sure of extracting large rents.  Even worse, the high value of land & rent in a supply-constrained environment puts a lot of vested interests in keeping supply low, in a vicious circle.<p>A sure sign you&#x27;re trapped in that vicious circle is if developers have &quot;community engagement&quot; and &quot;affordable housing&quot; dollars to throw around.",1397541841

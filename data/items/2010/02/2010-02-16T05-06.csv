If Greeks are so wealthy then they must certainly be able to solve the problem by increasing taxes and seriously pursuing evasion while cutting the bloated public sector.  The actual fact is that the Greek government and large international banks have basically conspired to steal money from French and German taxpayers, and the average Greek on the street has joined the conspiracy by refusing to accept that the promises made to them by their government in terms of benefits and services were simply a fabrication that had no basis in reality.",1266298051

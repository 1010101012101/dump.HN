2385297,comment,2383533,2383992,1,0,physcab,,,"I'm not sure how useful it is yet.  I've looked at the website quite a bit and have downloaded the IPhone app.<p>On one hand, its true that certain places are known for good deals for certain items.  If there is a specific cleaner I buy for my house, it doesn't matter which store it comes from as long as it's the cheapest.<p>But food is different. I'm more concerned about quality, shelf life, ease of shopping experience, and availability.  There's probably a reason why strawberries at CVS cost $1 vs $3-$5 at Whole Foods.  However, if there is a Farmers Market 2 days later and they sell strawberries for $5 - $10, I'd hold out and pay the higher price because I want to support the community and I know the strawberries might actually be better.<p>Maybe there is a way you can tap into the social consciousness.  For example, my mom is very proud of her ability to compromise quality and price. She will tell me something like ""go Safeway to buy bread items, but go to Nob Hill if you want meats"".",1301446782

You can eat all kinds of, well, crap, and if you exercise, you'll still be physically fit and probably even look healthy.<p>Sounds nice, but do not try this. Ask people who do this sort of thing a lot, or even for a living. E.g. bodybuilders.

They can definitely help to identify what you might be good at. For example I am an INTP. This means that I love to invent systems, but am not that decisive. I also am not good at repetitive stuff. ""Architect"" is the archetype. Many/most hackers are INTPs which is also a pretty rare type.  My wife is an ESFJ, she loves tradition and maintaining a social calendar. If it werent for her I would stay in my room and program day and night and wouldnt have any friends.<p>I know it seems dumb but it isnt. The hardest thing to do in life is to ""find yourself"", these tests can actually help to understand yourself better.<p>The one at pesonalitypages.com is pretty good for the interpretation but they are now charging for their test.

So find some great people and get the word out. I'd also suggest having a couple bullet summary of your personal value prop handy.<p>If you'd like to be more in the startup space then look at startup blogs for networking events in your area and attend. If you're in Seattle, you can attend things like OpenCoffee at Louisa's. I went a while back and met a few folks that were getting plugged in to various projects that eachother had going. I had coffee with Andy S (TechStars) that day. Your portfolio (which may or may not include open source contributions) will help seal the deal, but unless it's really prominent is unlikely to find the leads for you by itself.<p>If you're looking for enterprise level contracts, then probably the best thing you could do is go through a contracting agency to start. Most big companies don't hire independent 1099ers anyway, many times for insurance reasons (of all things...). Again the point always goes back to building your network so the first gig or two might not be what you want but keep in touch with the people you can. Make sure your gigs are at the best possible companies you can find. Again back to Seattle, Microsoft is awesome to meet great people at and they contract relatively heavily. Also the bio tech's are no doubt in need right now.<p>Good luck!",1301445705

To set context, the following quotes are a scattered selection taken from postings made by people other than myself during 1987.<p><pre><code>    ``I think I would be much happier if the underlying structure of the universe were significantly different.'' 

    ``I believe that within our lifetimes it will be common to see people not just hopping but hovering and flying down the street to the store.'' 

    ``Some where in its machinations, the library computer, or some other administration machine, has got the idea that I am the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter Day Saints. Me. Really! What is worse is that these bastards, with whom I am confused, owe the library $750.00.'' 

    ``For about the past year (give or take a factor of two) I've been having a fair amount of fantasies about doing it with women who are very facially ugly, but have large, firm tits.'' 

    ``I was booted from the girl scouts for `not being the right kind of girl for scouting.''' 

    ``Sometimes I want to kill everyone that doesn't think like me +/- some percentage of error.'' 

    ``So tell me, how is using a sheep condom different than fucking one? Nope, sorry you can't screw a sheep, but if you kill it, and remove everything but the large intestine, that's ok. Riiight.'' 

    ``The most gross food I ever ate was raw human flesh.''

The reason I left Blogger/Google when I did is that I felt it had reached a place where it was on solid ground and in capable hands (at the time, Jason Goldmans as product manager). Though still an independent company, I realized Twitter may be at a similar point today.<p>Do people really mean it when they say this, or is it just a thing to say, the same way disgraced politicians claim that they're retiring to 'spend time with their family'?<p>I mean, i'm not suggesting that there's anything untoward going on, it's just that with a few rare exceptions i find it hard to believe when people (politicians, CEOs, message-board founders, or anyone else) claim that they've left because they looked around and, like the Old Testament God, saw that 'it was good', and decided that their job was done there. I have not ever been a CEO or anything obviously, but the concept seems unlikely to me. 'I'm tired of my responsibilities', 'the culture has changed too much', 'i don't like my co-workers', 'i've got a more lucrative opportunity lined up elsewhere', 'i want to raise my new child', whatever, i'd easily believe those.

Therefore, the ultimate great ""idea"" is usually arrived at through a process of engineering and design tinkering, and not through a singular, initial spark of genius.<p>The main differentiators in consumer web startups tend to be: the speed and creativity with which the team can iterate, the quality of the user experience and design, and, if all goes well, the ability of the architecture to scale. The capacity to do these 3 things well is relatively rare. Finding a person or a team with these  skills is exceedingly difficult (especially in this talent market).<p>So yeah, I do stand by my assertion that the starting-point idea <i>is</i> the commodity, and the ability to build and design a decently scalable web-app in 4 hours (and then get user feedback and push another version later that same day) is a rare skill---especially on the open market, since most such individuals are either well-employed at companies or working on their own.",1301445251

And sooner or later, your tests will become tightly coupled via the fixtures: To add a new test, you must add some new records. But when you add those records, some other tests break.<p>If you instead use an object factory like machinist or factory_girl, you can create objects at the start of each test, and fill in random values for any fields you don't care about. This makes each test independent of the others, and it keeps the code and data in one place.<p>So if we admit that DHH's taste in testing is potentially imperfect, what does that mean for the Test::Unit versus RSpec debate? Not much.<p>Some people like Test::Unit. It's a fine library. I prefer RSpec, because it's a better match to how I think. And many of the testing libraries I want to use are actually work better with RSpec.<p>Oh, and if Cucumber is a bad match for your project, try Steak.

Don't get me wrong - I don't deny its importance, it's more that I question the nature of the beast. To me talent is instinct, a feel for what you're doing, and the 'right' type of thinking for the thing. It's pretty obvious when somebody has it (or doesn't), and I think obvious whether you have it too if you're honest with yourself about it.<p>Tech interviews <i>emphatically</i> do not test for this. Nor do they, I believe, test for smartness; I think once you hit a certain level of intelligence the rest is far more preparation and experience (and yes I'm getting Malcolm Gladwell on your ass) - so all a failed interview indicates is (assuming you are an at least moderately talented, moderately intelligent candidate) one or more of the following:-<p>* Lack of preparation (<i>knowing</i> the stuff, and <i>practicing</i> the stuff)<p>* Poor/incorrectly focused preparation<p>* Lack of confidence<p>* Bad luck - e.g. haven't looked at binary search for x years they ask about it, or what Steve Yegge termed the 'interview anti-loop'[1] - basically the guy interviewing you just doesn't like you and that's that.<p>The biggest problem with these things is that people (and I'm kind of talking to myself here more than anyone) take these things personally and put it down to some idea of talent that you might just lack. Fuck that.<p>The problem is that - and I'm risking repeating a well-known cliche here - hiring good people is extremely hard, and a false positive is <i>way</i> more damaging than a false negative. It is right, IMHO, that (good) companies probe algos, os fundamentals, etc. as this stuff <i>matters</i>; however failing an interview emphatically does <i>not</i> mean you suck.<p>[1]:<a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-goog...</a>",1301444801

If the article is viewed and looked upon favorably, it garners a vote.<p>Over time, two things increase as the submission gets more popular: points and comments. Number of points perpetuate the quality of the article. Number of comments demonstrate the quality of the discussion. Well, actually it doesn't. When comments are off-topic, stupid, or mean, they still add to the comment count and portray the increasing quantity/quality of discussion. So should these comments be included in the comment count?<p>Another issue with the degradation of comments is the display order of comments and their related threads. When a new comment is submitted, it is favored by being displayed in its own area and not tabbed in. Replies and subsequent threads are included under the original comment. This is pretty much standard practice. However, the issue is that new comments and ideas are unnecessarily displayed below the fold in favor of lower quality replies to more popular comments. This is favoring lower quality discussions to newer ideas that may never be displayed to the first-time viewer of the article discussion. So should children of parent comments be displayed automatically by default given this issue?",1301444081

A basic knowledge of C is very good to have, data structures, algorithms, and just procedural programming in general is a good idea to understand to be able to optimize later. Although PHP resembles C somewhat (based on what I've heard) so you probably do have some knowledge of concepts behind C, but I would recommend at least taking a few classes at a university or college, simply because they give you a well-rounded education, and you will learn other nice things such as design patterns.

285212,comment,284503,284503,0,0,stcredzero,,,"What the author says happened to the words ""Design Patterns"" happened to the words ""Object Oriented"" in the late 90's.  Words were appropriated to mean something other than the original intention.  Alan Kay has explicitly stated that by ""Object Oriented"" he didn't mean something like Java.  (Alan Kay once stood up in front of Smalltalk Solutions conference as keynote speaker and castigated the whole Smalltalk community saying: ""I didn't mean Smalltalk to be a <i>Programming Language</i>!"" * )<p>What the author's saying: Alexander did not mean something like the GoF Design Patterns, so maybe we should look at Alexander's book again?<p>( * - He originally meant it to be something like the OLPC operating system.)",1219593155

It's a matter of cost/benefits like anything else.</i><p>Maybe.  But if what we want is an institution for babysitting, we ought to <i>call</i> it ""babysitting"", and have conversations about the institution of babysitting.<p>Instead we call what we do ""education"" and have conversations where we treat it like a magic spell that will transform children and society.<p>I would love it if I could hear a politician or columnist say ""more investment in babysitting is always a good thing"", or ""babysitting is the key to solving our social problems"".",1219592323
285208,comment,284678,285001,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"Lisp, probably.<p>You write a fairly straightforward* Lisp interpreter in some existing language (often C, though ML seems like a good fit as well), use that to execute a Lisp compiler <i>written in Lisp</i> on itself, and presto, you have Lisp all the way down to the machine code. The non-Lisp scaffolding is only a temporary support for the initial construction. It may be built <i>with</i> C, but then the C vanishes. It isn't <i>on top of</i> it in any sense.<p>See also: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting</a> -- Compilers for Haskell, Smalltalk, Factor, C, etc. have been done this way, too. There's nothing specific to Lisp about the process. Consider: What are C compilers written in?<p>* I.E., don't bother optimizing it much if it's only run to build the compiler. Making it simple for easy porting is more important than speed.",1219592237

285205,comment,284192,284970,0,0,olavk,,,"I think Eich is advocating against explicit thread support in JavaScript like e.g. Thread.run() in Java. Separate threads per tab is an unrealated issue as long as the tabs cannot communicate. Tabs might however be able to communicate if one tabs opens another through script. In that case it might introduce racing conditions if the tabs runs in different threads.<p>Btw in HTML5 there is a proposal for cross-window communication  <a href=""http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#crossDocumentMessages"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/html/wg/html5/#crossDocumentMessages</a> which is asynchronous. This would allow communication between different threads using message passing.",1219591834

Unfortunately, the word ""education"" has magical properties in right-thinking conversation.  You can't say you're against ""education"", you might as well say you want to grind up the poor and use them for food.<p>We're making progress at the edges, though.  More homeschooling, more ways to educate yourself over the internet.  Still plenty of room for new ideas from clever hackers, too.  :)",1219591229

Similarly, Apple has had many fewer users than Windows for a long time but it's doing just fine compared to most Windows hardware vendors.<p>Other phone vendors have moved from Windows Mobile & Symbian to Android, partly due to the free O.S.

If RIM has survived okay up until now without it, good marketing might not cause the business to fail.

Why should I dedicate my limited time on a project which will probably be shelved, when I could instead work on something which will, with certainty, help people?<p>Thanks for this. I've spent too much time helping people work out the scenarios and options for projects which will never happen. I only recently started realizing this for what it is, and you just summed up really well exactly the problem with it.<p>A couple other observations - a friend of mine makes nature documentaries and commercials, and he's constantly getting requests from people who want to work for free for him, get mentored, get advice, ""look at my stuff"", etc, etc. He says whenever anyone asks to work for him, with him, etc., he gives them a simple, straightforward, ~5 hour assignment to do. That cuts 90%+ of people right there.<p>>  I enjoy backing underdogs, not losers.<p>I've found ""helpful-but-not-compassionate"" goes a long ways, since I almost never get requests like this any more. I write all over the place ""drop me a line, what can I do for you, etc, etc."" Lots of people take me up on it (I got 23 emails from people today, most were interesting... this is a bit higher than normal).<p>But I find losers like compassion. Instead of wanting to win, they want to feel good about being losers. Thus, any help you give them is useless to them, until they gain a real desire to win, and ideally evidence some of that desire. If you write touchy-feely stuff, you get people coming to you ostensibly for advice, but secretly just wanting a shoulder to cry on, which is worse than useless if you want to build real world stuff.<p>Ultra-practical, humble, disciplined, hard working, willing and eager to serve, charitable, empathetic, <i>but absolutely no compassion</i> seems to attract just about everyone you could really help, while turning off most people who want a shoulder to cry on. Of course, no compassion completely outrages people who have compassion as a heavy part of their identity.<p>That's the price you pay, I guess. I reckon all the practical people will look at these comments and nod, and the people whose hearts bleed will be outraged. That's not actually a good thing in my book, but so it goes. All life includes tradeoffs.",1292135887

It was all in Paypal because we used it for equipment purchases as well.<p>That's where the ""playing ball with us"" part comes in. We could've refunded the money had Paypal unfrozen our account. We couldn't refund because Paypal wouldn't unfreeze our account. They never distributed refunds to the complainants. They kept all of it.<p>The Kafka-esque absurdity of it was overwhelming.<p>All our problems were rooted in Paypal's unwillingness to unfreeze our account and make the refunds. Had that happened, Paypal and eBay would've had no outstanding complaints, and we could've used the rest to get a lawyer without trying to appeal on a percentage basis.<p>Which didn't work, which was also bizarre to us since it was, as you said, an open and shut insurance claims case.<p>It's been years since all that happened, and I've since paid off all my outstanding debts.

Ex - windows.<p>The OS 9 - OS 10 example is more of an exception than the norm. In the case of OS 9 everyone(even Apple people) knew it sucked big time. They tried hard for several years to fix it's problems or try to develop a new one. There was no way for them to continue with OS 9.<p>RIM isn't exactly is in such  a bad situation. Agreed that they need to woo developers much much more to their platform but that doesn't warrant cannibalization. They should continue innovating but should be more evolutionary.<p>The bad thing is that for a long time RIM sat on it's laurels without much innovation. Good thing is that they still haven't lost the market share. They already moved from their strong place of qwerty keyboards to touch screens. Much  more innovation is needed.

1996591,comment,1996237,1996237,0,0,mortenjorck,,,"The story of the Torch contacts list debacle is just astounding. How on earth could a system ship with redundant, easily-desynchronized versions of the contacts database? To me, that says the architectural problems run deep, and further, that there's no effective user experience apparatus in place to even try to deal with the usability problems that inevitably bubble up from it.<p>One thing the author doesn't really touch on, though, is the acquisitions that would appear to be directed right at remedying these problems. QNX has already been integrated into the Playbook, and by all appearances it's destined for BlackBerries, where hopefully it will sport things like a non-ludicrous contacts list API. The acquisition earlier this month of Swedish UI design firm TAT shows they understand that need, and could actually be a huge turnaround if TAT is actually given enough latitude within the company.",1292133716

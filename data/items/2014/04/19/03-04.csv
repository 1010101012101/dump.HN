Using a point estimate, I can accurately claim that there&#x27;s a 50% chance heaven and hell exist. This is technically true because my confidence ranges from 0% to 100%.<p>I get that people often need so-called &quot;killer facts&quot; — quick statistics that make an impression in press releases — but confidence intervals are more honest and they don&#x27;t take much longer to communicate. Instead of allowing people to say that &quot;x% of users prefer...&quot;, let&#x27;s say that &quot;x-y% of users prefer.&quot;",1397879952

Who is the designed consumer of this data.<p>In the US the CEW (census of employment and wage) is a data set that is primarily aimed at economists or modelers. The startling thing is how these data-sets became mainstream. I work in economics and for years no one was particularly conscious of when these figures are released(non quantitative people i mean) but now I am often surprised how many regular people know that the first Friday of the month is unemployment data day. The danger here is that modelers planning to work with the data are well aware of the signal to noise ratio and take it into account with everything they do. Unemployment data in the US at a granular level is also heavily redacted for a variety of reasons which makes this problem even worse.<p>2. The second issue that I would have loved to have seen this article elaborate on is what are our core metrics as a society. This is something that we still haven&#x27;t nailed yet.<p>I have friends who work at the government institutions the produce this data and they can tell you that most of this work is still done with a very mid 20th century mindset.<p>On the other hand I know people who work with large business data-sets such as supply chain data from Amazon Walmart and others. This data is far more robust and could be used to give a much truer picture of how the economy is doing but it is currently locked up under the veil of corporate secrecy. if gov&#x27;t statistical agencies could figure out how to work with this data we could do significantly better.",1397879389

7612527,comment,7610527,7611806,5,0,benhamner,,,"There&#x27;s several factors that make this irrelevant.<p>1) YC&#x27;s incentives look very different from VC&#x27;s: they get common shares, not preferred. This means their incentives are more aligned with the founders than with future investors (for example, if a VC has a controlling stake in the company & wants to fire the founder and dilute the common shares to basically nothing, then YC gets similarly diluted).<p>2) The dilution effect of the option pool on YC&#x27;s shares is trumped by the dilution effect of future investments on YC&#x27;s shares. If expanding the option pool has a marginal dilution affect but dramatically increases the likelihood of success, then that&#x27;s a no-brainer for YC to push for.<p>3) YC&#x27;s business model is dominated by the extreme outlier successes (e.g. Dropbox, AirBnb). Thus, YC does better by doing these three things better:<p>A. Increasing the likelihood that future successes are funded by YC (i.e. the founding team chooses YC early on)<p>B. Increasing the probability that a startup will become an outlier success.<p>C. Given that a startup is becoming an outlier success, multiply that success to the extent possible.<p>This piece hits nicely at each of those points. For A, YC takes a leadership role in how to structure a cap table, making founders look more to YC. Also, YC startup employees (ie future YC founders) think better of YC. For B and C, once a company grows beyond the founders, each employee makes very meaningful decisions on a daily basis that impact both the company&#x27;s likelihood of success and magnitude of success. Aligning these employee&#x27;s motivations with the company&#x27;s further helps make these decisions better for the company.",1397879370

Any idea that&#x27;s promising will have several teams working in. So if what was deterring you is competition, don&#x27;t let it deter you.

If you don&#x27;t have it today, and your idea is good, you&#x27;ll have it tomorrow, or next week, or whatever.  More than likely, if your idea is really good, you have  half a dozen competitors working away in their garages (or wherever) right now, that you&#x27;ve never even heard of.<p>My take? Keep moving forward.  Keep a close eye on what your competitors do, and <i>not</i> just in terms of product features and technical stuff.  Read <i>Positioning - The Battle For Your Mind</i> by Al Ries & Jack Trout, and <i>All Marketers are Liars</i> by Seth Godin, and think about what &quot;lie&quot; your competition are telling, (or what position they&#x27;re trying to grab) and figure out if you can A. grab that position / lie before them, or B. establish a related but slightly different position, where you can still be the leader and still make a nice profit.<p>Trout and Ries talk a lot about &quot;Cherchez le Creneau&quot;, a French expression that means &quot;search for the hole&quot;.  It&#x27;s a great expression in marketing, in terms of &quot;search for the hole in the market&quot; and fill it.<p>Like you say... if LayerVault is more feature rich and pricier, then maybe you can grab a different chunk of the market.  Do be wary of getting caught up competing on price though.  That can lead to a &quot;race to the bottom&quot; scenario.  See Thull&#x27;s book <i>Mastering The Complex Sale</i> for a good discussion of that issue.  If you go &quot;down market&quot; try to make it more than just &quot;we&#x27;re cheaper&quot;... more like &quot;Our product is simpler and easier to use&quot; and if it also happens to be a bit cheaper, then so much the better.  Better yet, make a simpler and easier to use product and then charge <i>more</i> than the competition!  If you can convince people of the value you can provide, they&#x27;ll pay for it. Again, see Thull for a lot on how to develop and communicate value.<p>FWIW, we find new competitors all the time... heck, one popped up in our backyard (almost literally) earlier this week, that we had somehow overlooked until a friend of mine interviewed with them.  Yikes.  But still, we keep moving forward.<p>I&#x27;m reminded too of what Bob Parsons (of GoDaddy fame) said once...  paraphrasing slightly, it was basically &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid to enter a crowded market.  Just be better than everybody else&quot;.<p>Edit: Oh yeah, one last thing... call this a nitpick if you will, but I&#x27;m not really a fan of the name &quot;Sception&quot;.  &quot;Why not?&quot; you might ask.  Well, because it sounds like a made up word, and it reminds me of famous &quot;made up word&quot; names like Inprise which sounded hideous and failed miserably.  And it doesn&#x27;t really fit the pattern of &quot;short, easy to pronounce and easy to spell&quot;.  Is it pronounced such that the first syllable is the same as the first syllable of &quot;skeptic&quot;, or does it sound kinda like &quot;inception&quot;?  And if somebody is telling somebody about it over the phone, or you run a radio ad, will it be obvious to somebody hearing the word, how it&#x27;s spelled?  Is it &quot;skeption&quot; or &quot;sception&quot; or something else?<p>More to the point, it isn&#x27;t really evocative of anything meaningful (not to me anyway).  A point that Trout & Ries emphasize in <i>Positioning</i> is how your names (company and product) should fit with your desired positioning and support the overall theme.  Does &quot;Sception&quot; support a useful position (&quot;lie&quot; in Godin terms) that you want to establish?",1397879286

Jessica Livingston just gave an interview listing the things that caused startups to fail; it was a short list, and included &quot;founder breakup&quot; and &quot;failing to build something people want&quot;, but not &quot;key engineer leaves&quot;.<p>This squares with ~15 years of experience, mostly in startups, a significant chunk of it in the valley. Recruiting is important, team building is important. But the value of any one &quot;key&quot; developer is lower than your comment makes it out to be. Loss of a key engineer is, for most companies, even in highly technical spaces, easily survivable.<p>Orthogonally, I&#x27;d also suggest you think of a Venn diagram. Draw a circle for &quot;highly effective and appropriately specialized engineer&quot;. Now figure out where the circle is for &quot;wants to found a company&quot;, and the circle for &quot;intrinsically capable of founding a company&quot;, and the circle for &quot;has life circumstances compatible with founding a company&quot;.<p>I get to talk to a <i>lot</i> of developers --- I hire them, at what I believe is a reasonably fast clip, and I work at a consultancy to software development shops --- and I think this notion that everyone wants to found a startup is the product of a lot of HN echo. Most developers do not in fact want to start companies. Starting a company is stressful and, believe it or not, even if you can wangle your way into being a founder many times in a row, it isn&#x27;t the most reliable path to retiring wealthy.",1397879032

7612478,comment,7610527,7610527,4,0,brudgers,,,"Altman&#x27;s post suggests that the context needs changing. I suspect it needs changing to keep up with some of the very changes YC has wrought - changes to VC and the creation of startups and the options available to the sorts of employees startup founders need.<p>The issue is that the new startup culture has diversified power and our concept of &#x27;business founder&#x27; is out of date. A software company founder is not the analog of a white shoe law firm partner.  A personal realtionship with Jeff Bezos isn&#x27;t why people buy toasters from Amazon or host their SAS on AWS, because it&#x27;s not some Rolodex full of 30 year of golf course  relationships and keeping the jobs of bureaucrats secure that make it rain. &quot;On the internet nobody knows you&#x27;re a dog.* [1] Or cares that you&#x27;re a founder.<p>While I agree with  Altman that something  needs to change in the direction of making employee&#x27;s richer ,I think he probably doesn&#x27;t go far enough. The problem isn&#x27;t so much tax code as capital structure and the rigidity of company structure that results.<p>A key hire is a key hire because it changes the company.  Ideally, a company would change it&#x27;s structure to reflect that change. Ideally, a company&#x27;s capital and corporate structures would be agile as in development.<p>Key employees are just as exposed to the &#x27;you can be a founder&#x27; meme as everyone else, and they&#x27;re in a better position to pursue it than most. A founder shouldn&#x27;t expect talent to hang around making them rich. In terms of game theory, I think of it as a founder&#x27;s dilemma. Altman&#x27;s piece suggests YC might be seeing it too.<p>In the current context, a founders&#x27;s 30% of a $40,000,000 exit is better than even a 1% employe share of a $1,000,000,000 one - much better perhaps than the numbers would suggest because 30% gets a seat at the table, and that old Mark Cuban idea of looking around the table? Well if you&#x27;re not at the table, the worst case is you&#x27;re just dead money picking up the tab for someone&#x27;s boat payment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/hiring.html</a>",1397878120

Economic freedom is multi-faceted: while Singapore may be &#x27;socialist&#x27; in in the ways you describe, for instance, it also has extremely low personal and corporate taxes, no capital gains tax, and fewer regulations, which contributes to its high economic freedom ranking.<p>The US scores below Bahrain and Chile because there are some ways in which the US market is quite unfree. For instance, bank bailouts of large corporations, massive agriculture subsidies and tariffs, and incredibly onerous regulations in some industries. Even Sweden has a freer market than the US in some ways, for instance via its voucher system: parents are able to choose to which public school they&#x27;d like to send their children, rather than having it determined by where they live like in the US.<p>Surely it&#x27;s not a coincidence that the top 20 countries in terms of GDP per capita are almost all within the list of top 30 countries in terms of economic freedom.",1397877115

I paid tax up front on the entire potential share grant when the shares were valued at $0.000001/share, which was a reasonable valuation at the time (very high risk, no tech proof, no demonstrated market, etc.). Although I have a significant # of shares and a significant % of equity in the company, the tax I paid was quite affordable. See 83(b) election.<p>If it pans out and I sell my equity, I will pay long-term capital gains on the difference between the valuation at the time of my 83(b) election and the sale price. If it doesn&#x27;t pan out, I&#x27;m not exposed to AMT or other tax weirdnesses that other posters have noted. I found this mechanism useful.",1397876923

If you also file an 83(b) election then you are indeed treated for tax purposes as if all the shares vested immediately, so if you exercise before the value of the shares exceeds your strike price then you pay no taxes until you sell the shares (or there&#x27;s an acquisition or something).<p><a href=""http://www.mystockoptions.com/faq/index.cfm/catID/B7469ACD-2DD6-4A51-85D787C8D8285FC7/objectID/D943A1F3-30A9-11D4-B9080008C79F9E62"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mystockoptions.com/faq/index.cfm/catID/B7469ACD-2...</a><p>As you say, the big issue with this is paying the exercise price. There&#x27;s not really any way around that. If you&#x27;re going to pay your employees extra money to cover the exercise price then you might as well just give them shares instead of options. Another option is to loan the money to employees. I don&#x27;t know how common that is with startups.",1397876827

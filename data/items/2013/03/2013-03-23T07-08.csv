Don't put too much weight on the interview style.

The reserves in the disability insurance program are on track to run out in 2016, Steve Goss, the chief actuary at Social Security, told me.<p>Goss is confident that Congress will act to keep disability payments flowing, probably by taking money from the Social Security retirement fund. Of course, the retirement fund itself is on track to run out of money by 2035.<p>Goss and his colleagues have worked out a temporary fix under which the retirement and disability funds will both run out of money by 2033.

5427550,comment,5427518,5427518,5,0,lutusp,,,"> Does being smart comes with bigger responsibility and do you feel stressful of being really smart (as a developer maybe)?<p>Views differ. There are as many views on this topic as there are smart people. John von Neumann took the position that being <i>in</i> the world didn't necessarily mean being <i>of</i> the world:<p>""You don't have to be responsible for the world that you're in."" --
Advice given by von Neumann to Richard Feynman as quoted in ""Los Alamos from Below"" in Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! (1985)<p>I happen to agree with that sentiment.<p>Also, when smart people decide to engage with the world's problems, they often get it spectacularly wrong -- example Nobel Prizewinner Bill Shockley's brainless campaign to make people aware of the imagined inferiority of black people.<p>Albert Einstein famously turned down the presidency of Israel on the ground that he didn't feel that he had a head for the world's problems. In my book, that demonstrated his genius.<p>I think smart people don't necessarily know how to competently deal with everyday problems, and very high skill in one area doesn't necessarily translate to even average abilities in any other.",1364023999

If they wouldn't be bitter they probably wouldn't have left (except in odd case of, starting your own company,academics, research). What you are missing is - people generally have good time in companies but they leave when things go south.<p>For example, the startup I left - I slogged there for 4 years and I left because of some leadership changes(pressure from VCs), heck I had to leave without taking the stock options because of some technicality. Yes, I am bitter about them but out of those 4 years, 3.5 Years were incredibly fun and I learnt quite a bit. I think story repeats everywhere.",1364023760
5427547,comment,5424241,5425323,6,0,olefoo,,,"No. Consumption is in fact a form of labor. One that in some manifestations is employed in support of natural hedonism; but often has little or no relation other than that hedonism is used to propagandize the consumption.<p>In the United States this is particularly and sometimes painfully obvious, when people who do not wish participate in certain forms of consumption are sanctioned in various forms. This sanctioning can be overt ""You'll need to wear a suit and tie if you're you want this job."" or covert, ""That guy rides a bike to work, wonder if he got a DUII?"" Keeping up with the Joneses is the job you have when you aren't at work.<p>One of the surprising things about social status in America is how often certain forms of consumption are effectively mandatory to signal ones class membership. Go looking for a CEO of a publicly traded company who chooses not to own a car for instance. Or a partner at a major law firm who does not have more than one residence. Those are only gross examples, one that is more familiar is the prevalence of electronic gadgets, especially those by Apple as symbols of membership in the digital worker class.<p>The truth is that our choices in those matters are socially constructed, and that social construction happens in response to needs that are historically contingent rather than deterministic in nature. True a certain amount of consumption, of food, shelter and medical care is biologically determined; the rest is cultural.",1364023728
5427546,comment,5425898,5425898,1,0,Darmani,,,"Test coverage is near worthless as a metric. I'm trying to write programs with countless possible states consisting of thousands of attributes, and gain high confidence my program performs correctly in every single one. Coverage states that I should focus on a single one: the program counter. I don't know about you, but there's a lot more to my program that the address of the instruction currently executing. If I keep a list of the streets I've driven on, that might give me a list of new places to visit, but it's not going to tell me how well my car's working.<p>So, if not coverage, what should we use? I like mutation analysis. How do you know if your image recognition algorithm works? You run it on new images. How do you tell if your tests are catching bugs? You add bugs and see if it catches them.  It's simpler than coverage in some ways -- you need no instrumentation.<p>And yet somehow, every test infrastructure can measure coverage, with mutation analysis nowhere to be found.  We have a huge literature on testing (mutation analysis is over 40 (!) years old), and yet developers simply choose to ignore it.",1364023619

5427541,comment,5420094,5426805,1,0,nbouscal,,,"Yeah, you're entirely missing the point. I haven't rendered any opinions regarding current laws other than to say that they are not relevant in this particular issue. I'm saying that the concern is the culture, not the law. The reason I'm talking about sexism as opposed to discrimination regarding race, color, religion, national origin, et cetera is that the jokes in question were clearly not discriminatory in those areas. Nobody has claimed that the joke was racist. That would be ridiculous. Many people have claimed that the joke was sexist, and that is the claim that I am taking issue with.<p>I'm talking about ignoring the law because culture is more important than law. Yes, there is plenty of interesting case law, and that case law is interesting when discussing the issue in a legal context. I'm saying that the cultural context is more important than the legal context, and therefore the case law is a complete non sequitur.<p>I would strongly assert that laws do not influence culture, and that rather the exact opposite is true. Laws reflect culture. Laws enforce the norms of the culture in which they are written. When the culture changes, the laws change. The reverse is not true.<p>I have not been arguing for change. I do think that some changes to tech culture should happen, because though the actual incident was not discriminatory, the internet reaction clearly was. That is a much broader issue, because internet reactions are always disproportionate and discriminatory. That is a standing issue that must be solved. What I'm asserting is that the joke was not discriminatory, and that the conference was not a discriminatory environment. Though I was not there, from everything I have heard from people who were, the conference was a very positive environment. This is good, and I take issue with people who would cast aspersions on the conference and the community as a whole because of a 'discriminatory' joke that was not in fact discriminatory at all.",1364023078

I wanted my software to feel fun and exciting to use, and in 2003, nearly all software I could think of had a crappy user interface and user experience.<p>Cas complained in many forum threads about about how hard and unprofitable it was to finish a game.  I remember writing a particularly long post about how he should just work on his game and everything will work out.  Also, I repeated advice many gave that he should use existing game libraries and engines, and focus on finishing the game.  Also, that he should create casual games rather than retro arcade games.<p>Knowing nothing about him, except how much he stood out trying to do things his way, it's amazing how determined he's been.<p>I realized only recently that Minecraft was created using the lwjgl (<a href=""http://www.lwjgl.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lwjgl.org/</a>), the lightweight Java Game Library that Cas created as a result of writing his own games in Java (how crazy!) instead of using existing open-source and closed-source game frameworks.<p>Not many people have the drive to create exactly the kind of games they want to play, as well as their own developer tools, for over ten years.<p>There was nobody there to tell him that he needs to quit his day job and join a startup accelerator, as well as find a co-founder first.<p>The idea that you will eventually realize some financial gains if you keep releasing quality games or apps is common wisdom.  But to actually realize, ten years later, just how rare it is for a developer to continue to make and polish stuff for themselves, regardless of what other people think?  Or to have created something that enabled a massively popular video game to be created?<p>That's truly awesome, and I'm cheering for him.",1364022658

451797,comment,451432,451432,0,0,fergie,,,"Content management is definately the way forward for any website that contains a significant mass of editorial content.<p>The challenge in choosing a content managment system (CMS) is that it is typical example of 'enterprise software' (in my head I am saying 'enterprise' in a silly voice and rolling my eyes), and therefore attracts a high proportion of expensive, yet functionally unimpressive offerings.<p>As somebody who has been around the block a bit with several CMSs, from high priced bespoke packages, to completely homegrown, to big name MeToo clones, I can tell you that in terms of functionalty there are 4 systems which lead the pack, and these are all open source. They are: Drupal, Joomla, Plone and Mediawiki.<p>However, (and this is where it gets interesting) the solutions named above are often ruled out in the early stages of procurement precisely because they are open source. Want to actually pay for a CMS system? The field for proprietary CMSs is wide open, and there is no reason why another competitor cannot break through.",1233042538

In Britain, Miles Berry, acting on Daguerre's behalf, obtained a patent for the daguerreotype process on 14 August 1839.

451791,comment,450926,451114,0,0,Todd,,,"Agreed. I'm a long time Perl user but I think C# (and Visual Studio) is well done and keeps getting better. That said, the Web Forms model has always been a bane for me. It violates so much that is web--from hijacking the HTML ID attribute for its own purposes (thereby forcing all your client side script to use hideous framework-generated IDs), to making non-standard form handling a torturous experience. ASP.NET MVC looks like it could be the start of something much, much better.",1233041491

Using eval seems reasonable in the context of executing code generated by your program. I'd be interested in hearing about alternatives.<p>In response to this problem, Clojure now uses an ephemeral classloader. I don't know the JVM that well, but Rich Hickey says this means the anonymous classes generated by evaling fn forms can be collected.",1233040073

Our founders were largely anti-religion (though you'd never know it if you heard the supporting arguments for prayer in public school), and nowadays you can't get elected without being videotaped coming out of a church.<p>And Obama, who is probably the least religious President we've had in a very long time, at his inauguration still had about one God reference per dollar in the budget deficit.",1233040040

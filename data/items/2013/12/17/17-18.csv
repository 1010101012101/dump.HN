He&#x27;s talking about the entire &quot;scene.&quot;<p>-- From the article:<p>T and Technology<p>T - E - D. I’ll go through them each quickly.<p>So first Technology...<p>We hear that not only is change accelerating but that the pace of change is accelerating as well.\nWhile this is true of computational carrying-capacity at a planetary level, at the same time --and in fact the two are connected-- we are also in a moment of cultural de-acceleration.<p>We invest our energy in futuristic information technologies, including our cars, but drive them home to kitsch architecture copied from the 18th century. The future on offer is one in which everything changes, so long as everything stays the same. We&#x27;ll have Google Glass, but still also business casual.<p>This timidity is our path to the future? No, this is incredibly conservative, and there is no reason to think that more Gigaflops will inoculate us.<p>Because, if a problem is in fact endemic to a system, then the exponential effects of Moore’s Law also serve to amplify what’s broken. It is more computation along the wrong curve, and I don&#x27;t it is necessarily a triumph of reason.<p>Part of my work explores deep technocultural shifts, from post-humanism to the post-anthropocene, but TED’s version has too much faith in technology, and not nearly enough commitment to technology. It is placebo technoradicalism, toying with risk so as to re-affirm the comfortable.<p>So our machines get smarter and we get stupider. But it doesn’t have to be like that. Both can be much more intelligent. Another futurism is possible.",1387303120

That&#x27;s an objection Apple has raised, too.</i><p>Why have two garbage collectors sharing the DOM? Couldn&#x27;t one construct a bridge that synthesizes Javascript under the covers to access the DOM and also maintains a reference for the separate Dart GC for the Dart object trying to access the DOM? This would mean that the native Javascript GC wouldn&#x27;t have to be aware of Dart at all, apart from the presence of some special Javascript objects that don&#x27;t get collected by it. Then, when the Dart side is done, and the Dart objects go away, remove the &quot;special&quot; flag from the JS bridge objects and let them be collected normally.

I&#x27;ve been developing with objective-c on iOS for several years now, and to say this as gently as I can ..it&#x27;s not my favorite language.  I want to play devil&#x27;s advocate for a moment and ask some tough questions (these may go away in a request/response scenario where the app isn&#x27;t running continuously):<p>* How does Objective-Cloud handle circular references (will memory leaks be a problem?)<p>* Is there a way to cut down on boilerplate (having to declare member variables, accessors, synthesize them, and understand the differences between var = _var, self.var, static class vars, etc?)<p>* Any plans to port to other platforms (Android) and if so, will it still use objective-c?<p>* How do you sandbox binary code (will security be a problem?)<p>* Will you allow third party binaries/libraries to be uploaded with the code (or will everything be open source/code only?)<p>To be fair, I believe that this style of development may be the future.  Perhaps we need a wrapper around pure C because it doesn&#x27;t do enough to promote inter-module communication, and C++ dropped the ball on that.<p>I&#x27;m just concerned because objective-c is ideologically different from, say, Boost, D, or Go.  It focusses more on patterns than abstractions and simplicity over correctness.  I&#x27;ve found it nearly impossible to build an app in obj-c above a certain size that&#x27;s guaranteed to run indefinitely, stably and without leaks.  And I&#x27;ve found that large obj-c projects often lead to spaghetti code and repetition, because of a lack of understanding about things like delegates, inheritance, using notifications instead of nesting code, etc.  Some aspects of obj-c are quite brilliant (like queuing tasks on the main run loop) but others like manual memory management are antiquated.<p>But kudos for this effort.

It was a little over 100€ and covered the distance in twelve hours, like the author said. After getting off that train, economically I could not fathom why anybody would ever subject themselves to that experience again.<p>The 100€ got me a seat in the back of the train in a semi-reclined seat (the least expensive ticket I could buy). I booked it about four weeks in advance. For 150€, I could get an actual bed to sleep in (four to a compartment), and the price/service level went up from there. If the train had free food or even just free water, Wi-Fi, showers, and such like you describe (at least at that price level), it&#x27;d potentially be a different experience. But Trenhotel&#x27;s stock is about as old as it gets, and what you get for the base price of 100€ makes for quite an unfortunate twelve hours.<p>I just went to Vueling, and I can fly from Barcelona to Paris for 40€ in two hours. Even with security, time to/from the airport and such, I&#x27;m still saving time and money. Copious amounts of baggage is the only thing left out, but I could pay 100€ to check piles and piles of bags, and now I spend slightly more than the Trenhotel and arrive five times faster.<p>High speed trains make sense for semi-long distances. Paris to Amsterdam is a great example. Three hours on modern equipment is very doable, and a plane ride can&#x27;t beat that in time (fixed costs of security and required early arrival are too high). Comfort is superior, and the price will come down. The author makes the point that the cost is 2x but the travel time is only slightly faster. These routes were just inaugurated, and the stock is fresh out of the factory. Give it a few years, and they will come down. I&#x27;ll bet you the old &quot;vintage&quot; routes that the author pines over were pretty darn expensive when they too were first inaugurated.<p>For the <4 hour trips, high speed rail is excellent, and I believe those prices will fall. But anything longer than that, forget the night trains. They&#x27;re only semi-useful for tourists and backpackers, and I&#x27;m shocked they still operate. I&#x27;ll fly, thanks.",1387301784

There are other sorts of pricing models they could even follow.  Why not charge a little bit more during off peak times, and then turn around and incentivize drivers using the subsidy from off-peak hours, rather than dumping it all on individuals traveling during points of tumult/crisis?<p>There are a lot of models between the awful medallion system many cities have and the way that Uber works right now.

Problems that a technical user might consider to be small shortcomings are a huge source of frustration to less technical users, who assume they did something wrong, or quickly come to distrust the product as a whole.<p>I observed this recently when I saw my wife play with a Windows Phone. The camera app was being difficult, and she quickly put it back on the display and turned to leave the Microsoft Store. My comments about the great display and the technical specs of the camera fell on deaf ears. To her, the experience quickly conveyed to her that the product won&#x27;t be something she can trust, especially since she isn&#x27;t comfortable enough with technology to feel justified in taking the time to develop workarounds.<p>In contrast, she loves her iPhone because it rarely lets her down. It&#x27;s not bug free, but Apple appears to be very rigorous in stress-testing the paths non-technical users are most likely to encounter. My Lumia 620, which I like quite a bit, will sometimes stop responding to touch input when unlocked to answer a call, and will sometimes not respond to voice input while paired with the Bluetooth system in my car. These are easily worked-around (e.g. simply locking and unlocking it will make it responsive to touch input again), but to my wife they&#x27;d be deal breakers because she doesn&#x27;t have a good mental model of the extent and scope of the bugs.",1387301406

Back in the day, say circa 2000, unless you were wealthy/lucky enough to have your own server around, if you wanted a website you were stuck with shared hosting.<p>Many of us &quot;web devs&quot; were running desktop windows and had never even used a *nix command line or studied programming beyond BASIC. CGI (perl) scripts were absolutely painful to install, much less write. Dealing with stdin just to get post variables? Python and Ruby were rarely supported as CGI, and there were likely no web frameworks back then that you could manage to install on a shared account. Besides, a lot us back then weren&#x27;t programmers to being with, we just wanted a web site to scratch an itch. Programming was a means to an end, and I think the rasmus quotes support that.<p>Enter PHP(&mod_php). Open up your FTP client, rename index.html to index.php, edit to add Hello <?=$name?>, load up index.php?name=Bob in IE, see &quot;Hello Bob&quot;, MIND BLOWN! PHP was easy to use, learn, and it came with a huge function library built in. It was a sandbox to play in. The barrier of entrance difference between cgi/perl and PHP was like GIMP to Windows Paint.<p>The number of web scripts available to use exploded after PHP hit the scene. Message boards, calendars, photo galleries, shopping carts, etc. Sure, a lot of the code written was horrible by today&#x27;s standards, or even CS standards of then, but that&#x27;s not the point. Websites were launched, communities were formed, products were sold. Sure phpBB, wordpress, and others code was not properly engineered, but where would the web be without the communities and blogs they allowed to form?<p>Facebook started on shared PHP hosting. The mediawiki script was created because Magnus Manske wanted to try out PHP. Yahoo actually chose PHP to replace their in-house scripting language over ASP, Coldfusion, and other proprietary options when using open source was a huge risk. Python and ruby were not even on the web radar when yahoo chose PHP. [1]<p>Now today we may look at the code derived from the era before python, ruby, svn, github, cheap easy VPS/VM access, when shared web hosting was the only PaaS, and look in horror, but the fact remains that PHP powers 75% or more of all websites on the internet today.[2][3]<p>To ask if PHP has generated value, is to ask if Windows has generated value. They may have been ugly, but they got us where we are today, and the PHP of today is not the PHP of 2000.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://public.yahoo.com/bfrance/radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon2002.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://public.yahoo.com/bfrance/radwin/talks/yahoo-phpcon200...</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/17/google-app-engine-finally-supports-php-the-language-that-runs-75-of-the-web/?goback=%2Egde_3801163_member_242396297#%21\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://venturebeat.com/2013/05/17/google-app-engine-finally-...</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_languag...</a>",1387301226

It is hard to be present when all you are thinking about is all the bad possibilities that may come out of talking to people you have never met.<p>If you&#x27;re scared of sounding dumb or &quot;new&quot; you won&#x27;t be willing to talk with the people who you think are much more successful than yourself. Handling the uncomfortable ball of nerves your body creates before speaking with strangers is hard. There&#x27;s no step by step list of things you can do to get over yourself. It requires experience which is earned only by attending events/conferences/meetups that are full of strangers. The only way around the nerves is being prepared with a quick blurb about yourself (which is also hard). Knowing how to respond to the &quot;So what do you do?&quot; question sounds easy enough but it&#x27;s also super terrifying if you&#x27;re a shy/introverted person. Having this answer prepared will allow you to get through the hardest wall of all: actually speaking to the stranger(s).<p>If you&#x27;re thinking of selling schemes before you even shake someones hand, your not going to be listening.<p>If you&#x27;re just trying to collect names and cards, you won&#x27;t be building long lasting relationships.<p>I try to forget about my business cards until I&#x27;m asked if I have one. I also try treating people with respect instead of a sales pitch, which requires listening to what they&#x27;re saying. I would bring business cards with you everywhere, though. It is good to have them on hand if someone wants a way to remember you. They are even better to have on hand when they specifically ask for one. You are not going to build a meaningful relationship if they forget your last name. Lowering the barrier to your information for someone who actually wants your information on hand is important. It is even more important if the people you are meeting expect a card as a way to remember you.<p>Respect also requires remembering their name (which is harder for me than remembering an entire conversation!). In order for me to remember a single name in the moment, I will immediately repeat it. Maybe once out loud, as a way of beginning the conversation. If I&#x27;m with a group, and depending on the age of the people, I&#x27;ll make it a memory game. I&#x27;ll repeat their names as we go around introducing ourselves. After everyone has introduced themselves I&#x27;ll repeat all their names again, sometimes letting them know I have a hard time with names. Self-deprecation helps me break the ice if I&#x27;m nervous and tends to make the group laugh. This works especially well when speaking with college students since they are usually much more nervous than whoever they are speaking with.<p>Being nice and handling conversations is difficult, and I think knowing the intricacies of conversation is an art. It needs to be practiced with everyone you encounter.",1387301205

That&#x27;s fine---I probably went too fast, anyway.<p>Not really, mostly just trying to get you to see it doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>I won&#x27;t go through your example with the US and Iran now, let&#x27;s concentrate on your rationale for using force. You keep talking about <i>retaliatory</i> force but without anything to retaliate <i>for</i>.<p>First, someone has to <i>initiate</i> force against you, before you can <i>retaliate</i> with force, and you can&#x27;t retaliate against some innocent bystander. If A has never done anything to harm anyone, B simply can&#x27;t <i>retaliate</i> against him. It makes no sense.<p>Likewise, if Person A has never harmed anyone, then Government B simply cannot use force on A in <i>retaliation</i> for <i>anything</i>, regardless of the fact that taxes are needed for any government to do anything.<p>Furthermore, the mere <i>possibility</i> that someone somewhere <i>might</i> use force against you does not enable any kind of <i>retaliation</i> on your part. You just can&#x27;t retaliate if no one has wronged you yet.<p>>> That does not justify the claim of &quot;immoral&quot; because it does not link it to a philosophical theory of morality that itself is, ultimately, logically derived from and necessitated by perceptual reality.<p>How about the idea of natural rights and the Non-Aggression Principle? -How about common sense, and our intuitive morality as human beings? For example, do <i>you</i> personally have the right to take someone else&#x27;s property by force, even though he&#x27;s never done anything to harm anyone?<p>>> That is just a floating axiom that they arbitrarily assume. Some of them have deeper philosophical arguments for it, presumably, but many do not believe that such are necessary<p>The problem with philosophical debates is that anyone can just filibuster any conversation by delving into semantics or the nature of language or the meaning of specific words or whatever, or ultimately the nature of reality itself. &quot;What do we <i>really</i> know about reality, or the nature of man as a life-form? For all we know, we could be living in a simulation!&quot;<p>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s understandable if some libertarians don&#x27;t feel like bothering to argue about morality. But as for the NAP (&quot;non-aggression axiom&quot;), it really <i>is</i> axiomatic, and that&#x27;s already enough by itself. You <i>know</i> it&#x27;s wrong to aggress against anyone, and so does everyone else. It&#x27;s just that if this principle is consistently applied to everyone regardless of whether they&#x27;re in uniform or not, then governments are clearly seen as immoral.<p>>> In a state of nature (i.e. if the government suddenly disappeared), force rules.<p>Does it? Think about how many people you know would go on a killing spree if suddenly there was no government tomorrow. -How about a string of robberies?<p>.. Or would most people just continue their everyday lives, trying to get by comfortably? -That&#x27;s certainly what people in general would do in a free society, just like that&#x27;s the way they behave now. If you don&#x27;t have any <i>intention</i> of hurting anyone, then you have no problem adhering to the NAP.<p>>> The only way to get out of a state of nature is to use force to elimiate it<p>Let&#x27;s get this straight. Because the use of force is immoral, we need <i>even more force</i> to prevent the use of force, <i>by force</i>?<p>The use of force is immoral, so you want to establish <i>the ultimate force</i> - a monopoly on violence, to <i>extort people</i> in order to <i>prevent the use of force</i>?<p>We need to engage in Immorality, to <i>prevent Immorality</i>?<p>In other words, we need to <i>do that which is forbidden</i>, to <i>discourage</i> others from <i>doing the same</i>, because doing what&#x27;s forbidden is.. forbidden?<p>We need to Violate, to prevent Violations, because Violations are not allowed?<p>Are you starting to see it? Do you see that if you adhere to the moral principle that the initiation of force is immoral, and thus, <i>forbidden</i>, then you can&#x27;t base a whole society on top of exactly that which is <i>forbidden</i>, while still claiming to adhere to that specific moral principle. You can&#x27;t get around that either, by making &quot;retaliation&quot; mean something that it does not actually mean here in the real world.",1387300964

Christians accuse other christians of practicing witchcraft when they practice forms of prayer that <i>they</i> do not approve of.<p>Asking the Virgin Mary to pray on your behalf in Catholicism is whitelisted, therefore according to Catholics it is not witchcraft at all.  According to tackless hardline protestants, it is not whitelisted, therefore they label it as what it really is, a form of divination.<p>Furthermore, your definition of divination is steeped in Christian bias.  What you are really saying is <i>&quot;prayer is not divination because it is [magical woo] while divination is [magical woo what does not fit the Christian perspective towards relationships between gods and men]&quot;</i>.<p>Whether or not you demand an immediate answer or need to be a &quot;true believer&quot; when you engage in the practice are both completely inconsequential.

While we mostly use trains to move around from town to town, the train service itself is abysmal. Dirty trains, missed connections, delays because of problems in the infrastructures/scheduling. I used to take regional trains to go visit my (now ex) girlfriend living in the neighboring city from mine (which is Bologna, a pretty big train exchange/junction between the north and center of Italy). Every single day my train would wait literally 100 meters away from the station, stuck there for an hour or so (outside of its timetable) because somebody messed up the platform and there was another train incoming.<p>Yes, we have a lot of ticketing machines where you can just go there and buy a ticket in 10 minutes, but actually getting to your destination is a whole different deal in Italy.<p>Also, thanks to the new high speed trains (especially connecting Milan and Rome), the fares for normal regional trains have skyrocketed as well (they want to push people on the HS ones). I clearly remember doing Bologna -> Florence for 7 euros 5-6 years ago, last year I checked again and it had skyrocketed to 20-25 euros.

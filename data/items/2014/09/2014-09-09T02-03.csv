8288531,comment,8287342,8287705,2,0,davismsmith,,,"ronbo, we work hard to find a measurable way to show our impact and I think you&#x27;re right in pointing out that this isn&#x27;t great. The way we calculated this was by dividing the entire cost of the project by the number of bricks needed to rebuild the school. The money we donate from each pack buys significantly more than 2 bricks, obviously, but this also includes concrete, roofing materials, labor, architectural plans, rebar, etc. We&#x27;ll work on finding a better way of communicating this. We loved the idea of showing the impact by the number of bricks needed, but I think it falls short of showing the actual impact. Thanks for the feedback - very helpful!",1410231559

I might be wrong here, but Reichstag should be Reichstag. The numbers where from the German wikipedia: <a href=""http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstagswahlen_in_Deutschland#Reichstagswahlen_1919_bis_1933"" rel=""nofollow"">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reichstagswahlen_in_Deutschland...</a><p>What we here are discussing is really depending on focus. Fact is, that the NSDAP had more seats in the Reichstag than any other single party in 1932 and 1933 (3 elections -- they had many, because of the instabilities of the governments). In the US, there are only 2 major parties -- so the party with the absolute majority wins. But in Germany (also today) it is very rare, that one single party reaches 50% or more of the votes. It is really very often, that the biggest single party has 33% or less of the votes. What is done, a coalition is made with an other party -- or even two other parties to reach a majority.<p>Same thing was done 1933. So it was totally normal, totally legal how Hitler reached power (at least by the letter). And: 33% of the people are a big part of the nation. So, the NSDAP had big support even 1932 in the country. That is fact, as sad it is.<p>The biggest single party in today&#x27;s Germany had 2009 also only ~33% of the votes, and where building a government with an other party. In 1949 it had even only 31% of the votes and formed the government together with two other parties.<p>You are right with Papen of course. He was from the Centre (Zentrum) party. The big parties rejected to form a government with the NSDAP, because it was no democratic party. But Papen changed that and formed an evil coalition, where the Zentrum literally supported the devil.",1410231358

Money and talent flock to the stars, and by stars I include producers, writers and directors in addition to actors and actresses. They make money and are prestigious to work with, especially if the movie is successful. In addition to individual behavior there are also the various unions like the Writers Guild of America, the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors Guild of America and organizations like the MPAA and AMPAS and in television ATAS which all wield considerable influence and money. Though it is TV and not movies, Netflix succeeded because it played by their rules.<p>You can&#x27;t just disrupt this because it&#x27;s more than wealth, it&#x27;s a culture that has been around many generations now and created film making what it is today.

Whether the Shetlanders later decide to push for independence is a separate issue.<p>As it stands, you&#x27;ve chosen a tough position if you want to argue that Scotland is not a very distinct country.  Bear in mind that they already have an entirely separate legal system, consumer laws, NHS, educational system etc.  More importantly, they overwhelming self-identify as Scottish, regardless of whether they happen to be voting yes or no in the current referendum.<p>Wales may push for independence at some point.

I&#x27;m with you in that I get annoyed when I run into programs which do just half-done job at a getopt replacement and you can&#x27;t do the normal stuff like &quot;-df&quot; instead of &quot;-d -f&quot;.<p>And yes, that&#x27;s pretty much what I&#x27;m getting at. The issue really stems down to the fact that getopt_long is just bolted on to getopt, so there&#x27;s still the string short-opt syntax like &quot;sf:t&quot;, and then you duplicate the options in the array of long opts with the chars or some random number > 255 otherwise. The string is really the most annoying part because there&#x27;s no good way to generate it via the C preprocessor that I could come-up with, leading to some duplication between the long-opts and short-opts. It also can&#x27;t easily generate help text for you from your arguments, which bugged me. My argument parser basically works off of a single xmacro header that holds all the argument information for getopt (Which gets organized via a few macros into an enum and an array). It&#x27;s dead simple to add new arguments and there&#x27;s no duplication or separate strings or etc. that you have to update at the same time besides adding code to handle that argument.<p>Personally, I wrote my argument parser specifically because I couldn&#x27;t find any that I was happy with after looking around. They were either clunky to use (getopt_long), or were full libraries and seemed like it would be a hassle to get it integrated into my code. I&#x27;d love to see a &#x27;standard&#x27; argument parser that works with long options well and doesn&#x27;t just feel like an afterthought like it does with getopt_long, but I think the chance to make such a thing has been missed. Personally, if I would ever use such a thing then it needs to be a single or just a few .c and .h files that I can stick directly into my program. I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to bet on the distribution having it or not, and I&#x27;m not going to add a separate dependency <i>just</i> for argument parsing.",1410230456

So they should already know when we call what percentage they&#x27;d be ok with. Since all they have to do is subtract one integer from another, five minutes should be enough.<p>The &quot;IQ test&quot; quote refers not to how fast they have to decide, but the amount of equity we usually ask for. In the median case it&#x27;s 6%. If we take 6%, we have to improve a startup&#x27;s outcome by 6.4% for them to end up net ahead. That&#x27;s a ridiculously low bar. So the IQ test is whether they grasp that.<p>There was one startup that turned us down because they received an acquisition offer during the weekend when we did interviews. It was a pretty good offer. I&#x27;d have taken it in their position, and they did. But other than that I don&#x27;t know of anyone who turned us down and went on to succeed. There have only been about three others who turned us down.\n</i>",1410230257

When I taught electronics lab, the physics students would get wrapped up in trying to think from the point of view of fields and charges, which honestly isn&#x27;t that helpful for electronics (unless, as mentioned above, you&#x27;re doing device physics).<p>On the other hand, research (by the PhET folks in Colorado I believe) has shown that having students play with a Java applet beforehand (that shows electrons moving through wires) really helps their performance in a basic electronics lab activity. This would be measuring voltage, resistance, current. However it&#x27;s likely that the sandbox nature of the applet is what helps, not so much the moving charge concept.",1410228278

In the gold business every reliable business has auditing and insurance while so far Bitcoin businesses are run like a regular startup with open offices. Who&#x27;s cleaning the offices after hours with access to the workstations or servers, who are the hired developers and are they smuggling wallet stealing software inside to transfer to themselves while on a flight to Brazil, who is writing their custom wallet and is it robust, how do we know they didn&#x27;t copy every address to themselves. Lot&#x27;s of security questions I&#x27;ve never seen addressed by any of the big exchanges. There was a payment processor startup that posted their office to bitcointalk.org which was floor to ceiling open glass windows with laptops facing the outside. How many binoculars are trained on those laptops across the street to get logins.<p>Some friends of mine trade large amounts of Bitcoin on a regular basis and there&#x27;s never been much of a delay withdrawing. I doubt they are going to a bank to physically take out printed keys everyday for every transaction over $10,000 or phoning 5 people to combine keys. I bet the backups are kept in a safe deposit box, the cold wallet is likely an offline system anybody can walk up to with some kind of feeble authentication judging by past Bitcoin exchange incompetence.<p>Many of the smaller exchanges are using Blockchain.info wallets as their hot wallet too but won&#x27;t admit it.",1410228257

7097873,comment,7097254,7097687,11,0,southpawgirl,,,"Sexism is a reality in the tech industry. Something has to be done. I agree with the intention, 100% -- I am much less sure about the means. Self-segregation is only reinforcing a us-vs-them attitude. Sexism starts with a cultural attitude that ignore the issue of micro-iniquity: it starts as a mental construction based on conscious or unconscious value wrongly bestowed to the members of some broad cultural category: it&#x27;s this fallacy that needs to be removed. Self-ghettoisation is, at best, a remedial plaster on a wound, at  worst it makes things worse. Not to mention that us girls often partake in broad categorisations, prejudices and stereotypes, sometimes against our own &#x27;kind&#x27; (see the women attitude described in <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109.full.pdf+html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109.full...</a>)<p>Today the problem is women, tomorrow (and, well, today too) black people, LGBT... is it really the shortest way towards the elimination of unfair handicaps and perceptions, to tackle one &#x27;category&#x27; at a time?<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersectionality</a>",1390334389

I get about 1.5% of their purchase price every month in rent.  At the same time, the property values have appreciated so the rents are starting to increase as well.<p>The longest I&#x27;ve had any of them vacant was about two weeks and that was only during the time I was replacing carpet, appliances, furnace, painting walls, fixing stuff, etc.<p>To make it completely passive I have a property manager (I live in the area, but I value my time).  That along with HOA fees and real estate taxes eat into my bottom line, but combined it&#x27;s only about 1/5 of the monthly rent.<p>These properties allowed me to quit my job, self-fund my company, and I&#x27;m actually putting money away every month.  Go figure.<p>I&#x27;m not a real estate expert, but if you have any basic questions feel free to get in touch (contact info is in my profile).  As background, I bought my first house at 21 and owned 5 homes by the time I was 27 (I&#x27;m 29 now).  I was in the military until a few months ago, so I didn&#x27;t make a whole lot, but I&#x27;m pretty good with money and invested wisely.

V - velocity of circulation of money cancels - this was pointed out in the 1930&#x27;s, but for some reason has never made it into the textbooks.

Not only did I believe it until I read this letter, I thought Gates Foundation was doing an unintentional long-term disservice to the world by saving so many lives that overpopulation in the remote parts of the world will lead to more suffering due to starvation/hunger, poverty, and depression.<p>If X% of children in villages in Ghana are currently starving, how will raising that to 2X% starving-but-inoculated children help the world? I was never able to get that question answered sufficiently well. My background is in Econ and Comp Sci so I have a pretty good understanding of the impact of foreign aid. For the past decade, I&#x27;ve preferred the aid to be technological and infrastructural in nature instead of medical because I presumed that addressing the health needs of the existing population was merely plugging a hole on a broken dyke.<p>I really don&#x27;t think she was calling me a baby-killer but rather questioning my faulty assumptions. I had made the same mistake that many others make when looking beyond their own monkey circles - that even people with little education make rational decisions about their lives, they&#x27;re not mindless machines pushing out kids because that&#x27;s what tradition or society demands. I never considered that the mothers in Ghana would have fewer children if earlier ones survived.<p>I assumed that because they are poor, did not have access to birth control, and were trying to maximize their long-term happiness, they would have as many kids as possible to maximize the chances of at least a few of them becoming successful. If you have two kids, both might be unemployed. If you have 12, maybe two of them will get good jobs and take care of you in the future. While this is great for the mother if two kids are successful, the other ten will end up repeating what she did and the cycle will continue ten-fold. I honestly believed that malaria was nature&#x27;s way of minimizing long-term suffering.<p>There were too many faults in my assumption and I believed each of the myths up to a certain extent. My beliefs were not necessarily baseless, they were just completely out of date. I have a very hard time believing UN reports because of politics, corruption, and self-preservation interests of bureaucracy. However, I see no reason to assume Gates Foundation having any malevolence, especially since they&#x27;re literally giving away their own money to improve the world long-term. So when they said my assumptions are in fact myths, I allowed them the chance to change my mind and by the end of the letter, I was cursing at myself for being so thick and wrong.<p>In addition to EFF, Wikipedia Foundation, and other tech causes, my future donations will also go to health/medical causes thanks to this single letter.<p>EDIT: If you want to know what REALLY blew me away, it was the single comparison shot of Mexico City 1986 vs 2011. My cousins in Mumbai grew up in the slums and now they post photos of their new [car|clothes|apartments] on Facebook. They were the kids bathing on the street and they weren&#x27;t alone. Almost all of their friends are now working for multinationals in Delhi or Mumbai and most of them are doing better than their parents. An entire generation of slum-dwelling children have their own bathrooms, kitchens, and access to unlimited knowledge, technology, and medicine. I assumed that more people meant more slums. I did not realize that it could be fewer slums and more apartments.",1390333414

We have an existence proof of this: it happened in the Greasemonkey ecosystem.<p>We might propose that we could prevent these hand-rolled systems by restricting eval(). Well, we already restrict eval for different reasons. What we see is a lot of people working around the restriction by injecting code into websites (!!).<p>My bet is that basically any significantly sized extension would implement a workaround for any autoupdate restriction we tried to employ. Developers really like the ability to update their product, and the workarounds are not that hard. And these workarounds would be worse than the original problem - that sometimes good people turn bad.<p>It would also destroy the value that autoupdate provides which you are forgetting about: most of the time it is used by good people to do good things. We frequently find extensions with security problems, tell the author, and then they fix and push them to users. Without autoupdate this wouldn&#x27;t be possible.<p>===<p>As for your proposal for how to restrict the levels of access extensions have... As I said above, we do this kind of thing already. You can read all about it here: <a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/permission_warnings.h...</a>. We have a very granular security system.<p>For example, it has been always been possible to write a youtube downloader Chrome extension that only has access to youtube.com.<p>Flashblock would theoretically be possible with the upcoming declarativeWebRequest API (<a href=""http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeWebRequest.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declarativeWebRequest...</a>).<p>However designing the right APIs that have narrow risk, yet are flexible enough for developers to want to use remains a difficult problem that is unsolved except in specific cases.",1390333399

I could buy a BMW 328i or a BMW 760Li. What the hell does that mean? Well the first number is the series of the car (the 3 series). The next two numbers are the engine displacement (2.8L). The i means it&#x27;s fuel-injected. The 700 series has a 6.0L engine, the L means it&#x27;s a long wheelbase, and the i again means it&#x27;s fuel-injected (d would indicate diesel, x indicated all-wheel-drive, etc).

This conference is a great opportunity to hear the experiences and perspectives of female entrepreneurs-- I hope that its content focus is more on their achievements and strategies rather than their gender.

The Metro design language <i>isn&#x27;t</i> really about monotasking and wasn&#x27;t really about mobile, and I think the <i>idea</i> of adopting as a unified cross-platform experience -- though its a pretty big break from the traditional windowing interface -- had some very good reasons and makes sense <i>even on the desktop</i>. The overlapping windows of the traditional desktop approach are, IMO, a pretty bad UI thing that we&#x27;ve all gotten used to, but something like Metro could do better...<p>The particular way the implementation worked out in Win 8 originally -- and this has been mitigated somewhat in Win 8.1 -- is still way too mobile focussed, and the sharp break with traditional desktop apps in seperate environments was a horrible UX choice. But I think the problem there was trying as much about pushing vendors to produce Windows Store apps and support WinRT (and, supporting Microsoft&#x27;s getting yet another cut of the application money, on top of what they get selling the essential dev tools for the platform), as optimizing the UI for mobile.<p>I suspect that something like Metro <i>really is</i> the interface of the future -- even on desktop-like systems -- but it may take someone other than Microsoft to first implement it right.",1390332628

Average consumers likely aren&#x27;t going to go directly to Lenovo&#x27;s site to compare laptops, they&#x27;ll go to Best Buy and find the prettiest one or the thinnest one or the cheapest one or whatever meets their simple needs, or they&#x27;ll ask a friend for recommendations. I could go on with arguments like that, but I won&#x27;t.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s inexcusable to us. We wonder how consumers ever manage to buy a computer, then we&#x27;re saddened when a consumer makes the &quot;wrong&quot; choice or are unhappy with their laptops. Yes, buying a laptop should be easier. But it works, and people still buy PCs. Lenovo is profitable, despite these issues.<p>People come to me and ask what computer they should buy, that their old laptop died after a year or the screen hinges broke. I point them to a $900 Lenovo that I know is reliable, a $800 Dell that I know has gotten good reviews, or even a $1000 Macbook which I know will last forever with no maintenance. And invariably, they all go out to Best Buy and pick up a $400 HP with pretty plastic and blue lights and complain when it breaks within the year.<p>So why don&#x27;t PC companies make it easier to understand their models? In my opinion, it&#x27;s because they don&#x27;t have to. Simple as that. People will continue to buy their cheap trash and continue to complain about it because that&#x27;s what people do.

Once the two agents are engaged in transaction, it doesn&#x27;t matter which is which.<p>Let D be the difference in wealth post-transaction divided by the total. The expected value of D is 1/2.

In other words, the person who takes 25% is almost guaranteed to be able to make less on the next transaction than the person who walked away with 75%. Suppose all our agents start out with 100, and that the 75%/25% splits are guaranteed. If each agent engages in exactly one transaction, then half our agents will have 50 and half will have 150.

It&#x27;s interesting, of course, because people are drawn to so many different types of game, and so you can sort of see how they are expressing a normally repressed aspect of themselves. Violent video games in particular are interesting, because people are drawn to them for so many reasons. Sometimes someone is just violent by nature, but other times they are competitive (or they wish to be), or they are just looking for the comradeship that one gains from being part of a team.

Sometimes is a historical gap in fields that have a self-perpetuating cycle of dominance (such as blacks in politics). It is tough to adress such underrepresentation, and it take generations to make any change (as it took generations and generations to create the initial gap).<p>This is no such case for female founders. Here we have a much simples issue: stigmatization. At least, this is how most people in this field, including the organizers of this event, seems to classify it. It is easier to address because a cultural perception is easier to change than institutionalized cycles of power (as in politics).<p>And, as I see it, this is the only goal of this event. No one is claiming that women are better than men in founding startups. Or the opposite, that women are worse than men in founding startups that they need special treatment. This event is only trying inspire women that founding startups does need to be stigmatized as a male club. Women can have a good life in founding one if they give this thought a chance.<p>So there the only assumptions I see in this event are that: (i) founding a startup is a good thing that they should inspire people to do (something largely supported by HN audience I would guess) and (ii) that women aren&#x27;t currently being correctly or ideally presented, attracted and inspired to these opportunities of founding a startup.<p>These two assumptions may be contested. If you disagree with assumption (i) you a have a much bigger fight to pick, basically the whole illusion that Sillicon Valley sells to the world, this event isn&#x27;t particular relevant in this broader debate.<p>And if you disagree with assumption (ii), that this event is not necessary, it means that is no harm done by such an event ocurring. It would by useless at most, but not particularly harmful.<p>This is my perception of this, and I am writing it hoping to avoid a thread full of heated debate based on false assumptions. Maybe I am being pretentious, but I swear I am just trying to help and expose my thoughts on the subject.",1390331897

Or maybe you&#x27;re thinking, &quot;I don&#x27;t get the point of Grunt, isn&#x27;t X better?&quot;  I can&#x27;t tell.<p>Grunt is to JavaScript as Ant is to Java.  &quot;The main usage of Ant is to build Java applications.&quot;  So, &quot;The main usage of Grunt is to build JavaScript applications&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m making a game and I use it for many different tasks:<p>1. Every time a coffeescript file changes, compile that file to javascript<p>2. Every time a js file is added or deleted, change the list of script tags in the html file<p>3. Every time a sass file changes, run compass to compile it into a css file<p>4. I&#x27;ve got a test suite (qunit, it runs off an html file) that uses the same script list that my main game uses (and more).  I&#x27;ve turned the script list into a variable so I don&#x27;t have to modify either html file by hand if I add/remove a coffeescript file.<p>5. Every time a js file changes, is added or deleted, run unit tests in the background using phantomjs<p>6. If a unit test fails, beep 3 times<p>7. Every time a coffescript file changes, is added or deleted, reload the page so I can see my change.  This is configurable so I can turn this feature off.<p>8. When I build for production, concatenate all the files and minify them.<p>9. Every time any file changes, update the html file to have a new build-time variable.<p>I would be super unproductive if I had to do these tasks by hand.  Grunt.js lets me automate these tasks and reuse them as many times as I want.  For example, I used to run my qunit tests by hand by going to the .html file and refreshing the browser.  But sometimes I forgot or I didn&#x27;t want to lose my train of thought.  Sometimes this would lead to me accidentally committing broken code.  That&#x27;s why I automated the tests to run in the background whenever a file changes.  Now I <i>can&#x27;t</i> forget to run the unit tests and I don&#x27;t have to lose my train of thought.",1390331805

For instance, AES with 128-bit keys will need to be phased out since Grover&#x27;s algorithm would allow a 2^64 time known-plaintext search. MD5 will likewise require 2^64 time to find a preimage, despite its resistance so far to non-quantum preimage attacks.<p>You should not discount that &quot;only&quot; asymmetric schemes based on DLP/IFP will be vulnerable, either. Much of our current key-exchange implementations do not have post-quantum strength at present.<p>Still, as you say, it is not &quot;end of the world&quot; status for cryptography. It will just require a lot of effort on the part of system builders to implement post-quantum constructions. The issue of backwards compatibility and widespread implementations will (as it always is) be a significant hurdle.<p>It&#x27;s my experience, however, that the average person doesn&#x27;t know or care about encrypting their data at all. It&#x27;s almost certainly the opposite on a site like reddit or HN, but anecdotally, when my parents&#x27; friends (as an example) ask what I study and I say &quot;cryptography,&quot; it&#x27;s exceptionally hit-and-miss if they&#x27;ll even know what I&#x27;m talking about.  (A nontrivial portion of people think I&#x27;ve said &quot;photography,&quot; actually!)<p>I&#x27;ve found that &quot;encryption&quot; is more widely-known than cryptography, but even then, it&#x27;s been my experience that most (non-techie) people have no clue about it.

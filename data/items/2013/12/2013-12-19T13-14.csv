Using the Montessori name was not a big marketing plan actually (I was really dumb about marketing 3 years ago - just check the name of my company, it is really not good - especially for the US Market!). It was just because the concept was coming from a Montessori activites my homeschooled daughter was doing... \nSome people told me that it was a very good marketing to have used the Montessori name, and now I agree but at this time I didn&#x27;t know that.\nMy second app and 3rd app has no &quot;Montessori&quot; in the title because I don&#x27;t want to use this name too much  (perhaps I should because my work is always inspired by Montessori methods we use at home...)\nAnyway, picking a niche and sticking to it is definitively something important and that worked well for me. All my apps are in this niche.\nAs a final note: when I release my first, there was almost no competition. The market was empty.",1387461542

6934628,comment,6933485,6934314,2,0,rpgmaker,,,"This brings up an interesting question: who are you on the web anyways? Take my case: I have never signed up for a social networking account on the likes of facebook, myspace, etc. I just don&#x27;t like to give up that much control about my personal information. To me, just putting it out there, even without the govt snooping on it is giving up WAY too much control over it<i>. Many websites I used to visit have become &quot;social&quot; over the years though but no matter, I don&#x27;t use my real name there, or real personal email account. On my android phone I purposely created another gmail account, not linked to my real personal one. I have avoided google+ like a plague and I have seen first hand how nuclear they have gone in order to make people enable the goddamn + account</i><i>. But the question still remains, who am I online? I&#x27;m still signing up to sites and email accounts that even if they don&#x27;t represent the whole picture they still have parts of it. It struck me that it may not matter if those accounts don&#x27;t particularly link to my real name: it is still me doing all that stuff online. Am I just my name or what I do? (Google probably doesn&#x27;t care that much about my &quot;name&quot;, they&#x27;re still getting a lot of information from &quot;me&quot;. To them all of us are probably just a unique ID on their servers.<p></i>I&#x27;m not a tinfoil hat kind of guy or anything like that. My efforts are still limited by the convenience of the internet once you sign up to the many services available. People somewhat skilled in tracking people online can probably still track the real me: just because I haven&#x27;t made much effort in actively learning all I would need to do in order to really hide myself online. I still think that I at least have mitigated it a bit so that not any Joe Schmoe can track me.\n<i></i>First I couldn&#x27;t review apps on the play store, now I can&#x27;t comment on youtube wtf?? but still, you will have to do more than that to get me on, google. I still think that they will end up forcing everyone to g+ in the end, at that point I will seriously consider just leaving google altogether.",1387461415

They were designed from the ground up to allow for compile-time code rewriting, and because that was the primary driving goal from the start, they have <i>amazing</i> code rewriting capabilities that other languages cannot begin to dream of.<p>But the distinction I was trying to draw is that I&#x27;m talking about going further with that idea. Homoiconic syntax only allows for local code re-writing, but there are many other kinds of things we&#x27;d like to programmatically transform on a large codebase.<p>Half-baked examples: We&#x27;d like to replace all use of new/delete with smart pointers, but only in source files that are in one particular section of the codebase. Or we&#x27;d like to move all our unit tests from being in a separate package/dll, to being included in the same dll but surrounded by compiler pragmas.<p>(2) How the language would differ -- I don&#x27;t yet know. But just as homoiconicity says &quot;let&#x27;s allow our end goal of automatic code rewriting to dictate our syntax&quot;, what I&#x27;m trying to say is, &quot;let&#x27;s allow our end goal of automatic refactorability / transformability to dictate all the programming language design decisions we make.&quot;<p>I think probably many of the things Raphael_Amiard mentions in this thread would be a part of it: strong inferred typing, perhaps, and a strong package system. Perhaps the ability to write some kind that was intentionally agnostic about how it would be packaged, and write some code elsewhere that says &quot;take that code over there, and package it thusly.&quot; It would need to know if certain snippets were functionally pure (sort of how D does with &quot;pure nothrow&quot;), because then it would know it have more freedom with how it could transform that code.<p>Hopefully that clarifies the idea.

Integration testing on the other hand makes a lot more sens.<p>When I started with Java, it seemed appropriate to put hundreds of getter / setter methods. Is there much advantage to that over allowing the variable to be accessed directly? (Perl felt very strange at first having getter and setter methods combined as one method).<p>As I get more experienced as a developer, my skill set has grown but my coding becomes simpler. Don&#x27;t use every language feature to show how knowledgeable you are. Use it when appropriate, and when it makes the code more readable / reusable / simpler.

This is why, on some heavy volume days, you will see the message that Coinbase itself (not just you as a user) has reached its buy limit for the day. They buy at the price they quote you, then wait for your funds to clear ACH to deposit the coin in your account.<p>So, another risk Coinbase has is when a customer buys (prompting Coinbase to buy), then the customer&#x27;s funds don&#x27;t settle via ACH. Coinbase is then stuck with the coin until they can fulfill someone else&#x27;s order. This might be at a loss if BTC has moved down. In fact, if a user places an order and BTC moved sharply down, it is likely possible that the user could purposely liquidate the bank account so the ACH would fail. I am betting they have seen this.<p>They have been toying with Instant buys as well, but having to adjust their requirements. In the first iteration, I remembered wondering how they weren&#x27;t losing their shirts, as it was designed pretty naively, as if everyone were honest. Sure enough, they changed their requirements.<p>In general, they take on more risk than their customers, but one thing I do fault them for is failing to communicate changes in requirements, etc. And, apparently, they do need more robust processes, automated auditing, etc. It is the most reliable place to buy that I have found, but it definitely has some of the Wild West feel of BTC itself.",1387460316

The fact that there is a skewed gender distribution may not necessarily be a problem, but merely a difference in preferences. As long as we have no law or other system that discriminates against women or men, there may be no one but our biology to blame for such skewness.<p>[1] Behavioural gender differences become evident at very early ages, before any external pressure is exerted upon children. This is a widely studied issue, see for example:<p>Alexander, G. M., & Hines, M. (2002). Sex differences in response to children&#x27;s toys in nonhuman primates (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus). Evolution and Human Behavior, 23, 467–469.<p>Bailey, J. M., & Zucker, K. J. (1995). Childhood sex-typed behavior and sexual orientation: A conceptual analysis and quantitative review.

6934508,comment,6933993,6933993,5,0,beloch,,,"In spite of how it begins, this article can be read as yet another criticism of men, albeit an underhanded one.  Two key points the author makes betray this:<p>&quot;Yes, there has been a gradual transition from an industrial to a service-sector economy in which women, who generally prefer a safe, clean, quiet work environment thrive.&quot;<p>&quot;After the next inevitable apocalypse, men will be desperately needed again! Oh, sure, there will be the odd gun-toting Amazonian survivalist gal, who can rustle game out of the bush and feed her flock, but most women and children will be expecting men to scrounge for food and water and to defend the home turf. Indeed, men are absolutely indispensable right now, invisible as it is to most feminists, who seem blind to the infrastructure that makes their own work lives possible. It is overwhelmingly men who do the dirty, dangerous work of building roads, pouring concrete, laying bricks, tarring roofs, hanging electric wires, excavating natural gas and sewage lines, cutting and clearing trees, and bulldozing the landscape for housing developments. It is men who heft and weld the giant steel beams that frame our office buildings, and it is men who do the hair-raising work of insetting and sealing the finely tempered plate-glass windows of skyscrapers 50 stories tall.&quot;<p>To summarize, she argues that women are better adapted to the modern white-collar workplace while men, thanks to their brute strength, are better adapted to lower status blue-collar jobs, and nothing short of an apocalypse will put men back on top.  There&#x27;s certainly no rancor against men evident in this fact-based argument!<p>This end to the article is especially unfortunate because there should be some real concern about how men are portrayed in modern media. In children&#x27;s movies, boys have become brutish, bullying antagonists to the protagonist princess more often than not. In comedies, the most common formula pairs a strong, competent, beautiful woman with a bumbling, slob of a man-child who will inevitably woo the lass with sweet intent more than anything else. Arguably, this probably reflects the fantasies of the bumbling, slovenly, men-children running Hollywood more than a deliberate campaign against the competent male, but the effect is the same. Action flicks glorify blue-collar men.  The cerebral, hero scientists of decades past are long gone.  Heck, even Indiana Jones is grossly over-educated by modern action hero standards!",1387460055

The author then has to address all comments from the reviewers, either to correct something (or to make it clearer and understandable) or to reply why it was not corrected. And this goes back and forth until everything is sorted out.<p>2) After that, technical editors review all chapters and if they feel that something may not be clear enough to the reader or it may have to be double-checked by the author, they will contact him and he&#x27;ll have to update his drafts again.<p>3) Then, when the technical editors finish their thing and provide pre-final copies of the chapters, the author has to proofread everything, in order to make sure that everything is as it should be. If the author finds that something is not right he sends feedback to the editors.<p>You can see that there are many people involved on Packt&#x27;s side, and (in my case) every one of them cares about quality.

The first is a tape-up job to &quot;git &#x27;er done&quot; and the second is a more elegant and architected approached.<p>This method matches the configuration of most jobs. The client doesn&#x27;t (fully) know what they want. Last-minute, world-bending exceptions arise. Well-intentioned schemes gang aft agley.<p>With this prototyping-production, I&#x27;m able to get something up and working, and can fix it later if the client has foresight.<p>Theory is great. I am the first to defend theory.

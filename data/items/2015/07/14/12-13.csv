Its an interesting cultural problem that the claims might actually be true in that that country!<p>WRT the second quote, that doesn&#x27;t answer the question.

9884480,comment,9883882,9883882,0,0,drivers99,,,"Progress is made by consistently working at a thing every day.  If I were you, I would choose one topic (for example, a specific programming book) and keep track of what that one thing is that you make progress on every day.  Have a good reason for choosing that book so that you can be motivated; remember why you started that book or whatever it is.  If you try to learn other things besides that the rest of the day, and those things change with your mood, that&#x27;s fine. Just have that one topic you&#x27;re learning be something that you don&#x27;t change, or at least change consciously when it&#x27;s the right time (finished book, or your reason for starting it is no longer true).  Spend at least 1 minute every day on that. (I mention only 1 minute because it builds the habit, and you&#x27;ll usually end up doing more. But if you don&#x27;t do at least 1 minute, you could go years without doing it, or not do it at all.)  You might want to make that 1 thing something you do first thing in the morning, if you&#x27;re a morning person. There is less chance that something will disrupt your routine that way.<p>I should start following this advice myself.",1436878741

Here&#x27;s why...<p>UIGEA, [1] the legislation that was used to take down the online poker sites, contained an exemption for fantasy sports.  However, that exemption is only valid if the business is operating in compliance with individual state laws.  There is an increasing sentiment that DFS is sports gambling under a number of state laws, and many people are just waiting to find out which state will prosecute first. At the time the UIGEA exemption was created, legislators hadn&#x27;t even contemplated the concept of DFS, and the very legislators that wrote the exemption have expressed concern over it.<p>Since investors with this kind of money have done their due diligence, my guess is that they just want to ride the revenue train until the inevitable state-by-state crackdown occurs.

I&#x27;m a decent engineer now, and have really figured out what works for me so this is my current perspective on approaching learning.<p>The practice is important. I plow through books too but you need a project to become proficient. I bought a laptop and started working on some small scala projects on my laptop and reading books. That was enough to let me submit some janky scala for an interview and land a job as a scala engineer.<p>Some material is harder to learn, some of it is easy. I think it&#x27;s better to defer reading books for a bit and get some familiarity with the basics so you have a point of reference while reading. The other day I was assigned a pretty big feature with a piece of the domain I wasn&#x27;t too familiar with. I spent a few days writing a parser to get closer to the spec before starting to work on design docs etc. Having the familiarity then allows me to make sense of the research and existing design documentation so I think having a point of reference is a really important part of the reading/learning. If it&#x27;s too far away from my current experience, I can&#x27;t draw new pathways so it just falls out of my head. If I have that basic seed, I can grow some new pathways and expand my position with reading etc.<p>Ultimately, I think the best way to learn is to actually present the information again to other people. This is the culmination of practice and research together. To write a detailed article on a topic, you&#x27;ll have to both write the code and also do a lot of reading. Any gaps in your knowledge you&#x27;ll identify while you&#x27;re writing and then it&#x27;s a simple bit of google-fu to get a really solid level of understanding on a topic as you fill out your article.<p>Re-implementing things is also a terrific way to expand your knowledge. If you read a pattern book, you&#x27;ll have some high level understanding of how the patterns fit together. Once you apply the pattern once, though, you&#x27;ll never forget it and you&#x27;ll see how it works at a very different level. So couple that with writing an article, etc, and it&#x27;s a super effective approach to learning.",1436877632

Due to nature of Iran spread facilities, it is extremely difficult to destroy Iran&#x27;s program with an air strike unless there are boots on the ground and occupation which is clearly not an option. According to best estimates it would only delay the program by one year with the outcome that Iran will actually quit NPT. Moreover, an attack would unite all Iranian to support the government. So in any case, this approach is not going to be toward the objective.<p>It is also partly wrong to think that sanctions brought Iran to the negotiating table, Iran has always been negotiating. In fact, most of the development of enrichment was done during UN sanction. Sure, people and economy suffered but again the objective was not the collective punishment it was to reduce Iran program which did not work. What caused Iran to accept to limit its program was the fact that the US accepted peaceful program and research nuclear capabilities which is a matter of pride and recognition.<p>&quot;Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results&quot;<p>However, I totally agree with you if your approach is to create another North Korea.",1436877366

Immutable infrastructure does not require nor warrant restricting the form of access you have to your services.<p>Having everything build-oriented (basically building the builder on every deployment, than using it to build the service) is what prevents drift.<p>Running on a read-only file system is what guarantees immutability and prevents drift.<p>Not allowing SSH is plugging a single hole which guarantees nothing. Can the app-server write on its own disk? Can it modify configuration files? Maybe even code?<p>As a developer I want to be able to write applications that are not specific to any one deployment method. I want to be able to change my mind to host this on different kind of infrastructure. These kind of limits force you to create a strong adherence between your application and its tooling and the deployment method.<p>Of course, the Read/Write domain has to be explicit and limited, but this is good practice anyway. Running on a distributed storage grid based on something like CEPH can allow you to address this domain not only explicitly but also in a fault-tolerant and scalable way.<p>When you cut off SSH you are cutting off half of the tooling we have and you make everything overly complicated. I want to be able to tail any log on any host. I want to be able to scp for inspection any file to my dev machine.<p>At platform.sh (a PaaS running on a distributed grid of micro-containers) we run a build oriented immutable infrastructure so there is no, there can be no infrastructure drift.<p>We proxy SSH so security stays the responsibility of the orchestration layer not any single host or service. This means we can filter by role any connection to any service, but developers can still just use the tools that work.",1436877341

I&#x27;m not suggesting you should go that far, but the trouble is I don&#x27;t see much evidence that you&#x27;ve actually done much to get people to your sites - there&#x27;s not much in the way of content and I doubt you show up in search even for relatively niche queries like &quot;npower overcharge refund&quot;.<p>Since you&#x27;re keen to improve your skills and domain knowledge, SEO and marketing are what&#x27;s going to make you money.<p>The same goes for tweaking the wording. npower being forced to refund £70m customers should be on the front page, not halfway down the FAQ below a couple of sarcastic comments.\n(I didn&#x27;t know that, and I once had a £2.5k sorry-we-haven&#x27;t-billed-you-on-time gas bill from npower land on my doormat, which fortunately was not my debt) Similarly, I don&#x27;t see a mail address, company registration and details of FCA registration in the footer for Transfercorp, which is a pretty massive red flag for a site promising to handle my money. Your site on the theme of lost money transfers doesn&#x27;t link to your actual money transfer site. It&#x27;s not the technical behaviour of the app that&#x27;s holding you back.",1436875951

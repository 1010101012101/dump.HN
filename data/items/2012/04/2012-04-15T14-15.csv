Oracle closed the gate shortly after the acquisition, with the promise they'd drop code after Solaris 11 was released. This has not happened.<p>OpenIndiana, SmartOS and OmniOS are all distributions of the illumos kernel and associated libraries and programs.<p>OpenIndiana is geared more towards desktop users (though it can be used for servers well enough). OI is funded primarily through everycity.co.uk.<p>SmartOS is a PXE/USB booting server operating system, where all services are meant to be encapsulated in zones and KVM. SmartOS zones use pkgsrc for packaging (via pkgin). SmartOS is useful for building clouds, for instance. It is the core of Joyent's SmartDatacenter product.<p>OmniOS is a more traditional server operating system in that you install bits on metal, use IPS for packages, and have an upgrade path other. OmniOS has been used in production inside OmniTI for a while (as I understand it), but is the newest player on the block.<p>As with Linux distributions, each distribution above has different operating and development philosophies, but they all push code back up through the illumos gate.<p>Sun is dead. Oracle ate Sun, took their ball, and went home. illumos is the successor of the OpenSolaris idea (sans asinine governance model), and the core of open source Solarish distributions.<p>This talk by ex-Sun kernel engineer (and creator of DTrace) Bryan Cantrill is both instructive and hilarious: <a href=""http://smartos.org/2011/12/15/fork-yeah-the-rise-and-development-of-illumos-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smartos.org/2011/12/15/fork-yeah-the-rise-and-develop...</a>",1334500769

Back in 1982, storage and bandwidth were so limited that even online encyclopedias were pie-in-the-sky so even thinking it was possible put you in pretty visionary company.<p>As for user-editable I can find two predictions which might qualify.<p>First, Vannevar Bush's Memex:<p>""Wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready to be dropped into the memex and there amplified. The lawyer has at his touch the associated opinions and decisions of his whole experience, and of the experience of friends and authorities. The patent attorney has on call the millions of issued patents, with familiar trails to every point of his client's interest. The physician, puzzled by a patient's reactions, strikes the trail established in studying an earlier similar case, and runs rapidly through analogous case histories, with side references to the classics for the pertinent anatomy and histology. ... The historian, with a vast chronological account of a people, parallels it with a skip trail which stops only on the salient items, and can follow at any time contemporary trails which lead him all over civilization at a particular epoch. There is a new profession of trail blazers, those who find delight in the task of establishing useful trails through the enormous mass of the common record. The inheritance from the master becomes, not only his additions to the world's record, but for his disciples the entire scaffolding by which they were erected.""<p>-- As We May Think (1945)<p>Douglas Adams managed to predict the user-editable encyclopedia in 1982's ""Life, The Universe and Everything"": ""most of the actual work [on the Hitch-hiker's Guide] got done by any passing stranger who happened to wander into the empty offices of an afternoon and saw something worth doing.""<p>But he didn't predict an online one, in the series at the time, HG2G was a local e-book or database-type encyclopedia that was updated via the Sub-Etha network.<p>Vannevar Bush had some amazing insights in 1945 about the future direction of storage:<p>""The Encyclopdia Britannica could be reduced to the volume of a matchbox. A library of a million volumes could be compressed into one end of a desk"".",1334500292

What makes school bullying viable is that nothing you do matters---the effect of everything you do is delayed twelve years.  Everyone progresses at the same rate through the institution, in spite of high or low performance.  So if no one's going to outrace you (and even if they did, it would only be academically, which no one cares about it in k-12), there's no real penalty for becoming some poor kid's private nightmare.<p>Not so much in the business world (and especially tech); while you're busy engaging in a dogfight with Joe Competitor, some third company is kicking your trash by spending money on R&D rather than winning a marketing/feature war.

In practice, the bully will take the path of least resistance and pick on someone else. Which sucks for them, but the hierarchy has now shifted - the original victim has moved up, but the capability/social capital of the new lowest member of the group is still higher than theirs was. It doesn't take many iterations of this cycle before the bully will either meet their match or have a critical mass of the class openly against them.<p>This happened in my primary school, actually, the bully in this case was a kid who'd been held back from a higher year.

Unbelievable.<p>Imagine if the book had instead covered the topic of how to get away with date rape at parties, or how to get away with beating one's spouse regularly, or how to evade the law and become some sort of anti-Semitic race killer or gay basher or stalker.

1895632,comment,1895057,1895057,0,0,steauengeglase,,,"Essay time.<p>In my freshman and sophomore years in college I did some substitute teaching. It was easy money. The state gives you $90 if you can pass a TB test and everyone makes it through the day with all digits. Simple enough.<p>So one day I was subbing in a high school math class. I looked over the lesson plan and noticed that one kid was marked as a ""disruption"". As I'm going over the roll I'm looking for him. Football player? Nope, not him. Thug kid? Nah. Smug asshole attention seeker? No. Oh, there he is and holy shit it's me! White kid with glasses, either over or under weight and reading Musician's Friend, probably has a copy of Elektor hidden in there somewhere. His bookbag has every one of his books in it because he doesn't want to go to his locker. Either someone keeps messing with him or he subconsciously doesn't want to remember his combination.<p>Soon the disruption became obvious. Every few minutes someone would hit him or yell something at him and he kept withdrawing into his shell. After I threw a couple out it stopped. After class I stopped him on the way out and chatted for a few minutes. I was right, there was a copy of Elektor in his bag and no, he couldn't remember his combination.<p>During lunch I hung out in the teacher's lounge and chatted with a few of the teachers. Finally I asked them about him. It was a consensus, he was a disruption and they couldn't wait to find a reason to expel him. This was the point where I realized I'd never make it as a teacher. After years of being angry at the other kids it never occurred to me that they were also the enemy. Suddenly the codes made sense. How many times had I heard teachers say that students should be able to ""learn in a non-disruptive environment""? Fuck, they wanted me to get thrown to the wolves; it was always a part of the plan. I was just a cancer in the education system's body, something that didn't just work its way out, despite their best non-efforts.<p>The following year I took a job in a call center and moved to their IT dept. Subbing was easy, but at least IT didn't feel like blood money. There was a silver lining. I ran into that kid a few years ago in a restaurant. He was married with a kid of his own. He rushed and grabbed by hand. ""I just want to say thanks. You were right, they were all assholes.""<p>That was by far my most satisfying job related moment. Only Hallmark moment I have to offer.",1289515321

I die a little inside when I use the APT term, but people who get it, get it, and people that listen to marketers (rightfully) act suspicious.<p>The attacks are real and have been going on since the 90s, but it's not as clean cut as people make out. The primary distinguishing factor is the 'P' for persistence, not necessarily the 'A'. Anyone selling on a ""don't let this happen to you"" message is obviously selling bunk. You're either a target or not for this stuff, and that depends on a whole load of factors. If you're not a target then your biggest similar threat is probably broad malware attacks (more associated with botnets) or unfocused criminal activity. If you're susceptible to APT, it's because you've already been hit. That's why ""don't let this happen to you"" doesn't work - it will happen, and it will happen again. The trick is to detect it and kick the buggers out before they cause any (qualified) damage.<p>You make an interesting point about App Pen Tests. I'm surprised that you say that it rarely pivots. We do all the time. We routinely face people who say Cross-Site Scripting isn't an issue, until we show them different ways of attacking their users - as opposed to the dull alert('XSSLOL');<p>Likewise for SQL injection I certainly find that breaking in and hunting around leads to all kinds of things you otherwise wouldn't see.

On a site like this, where we make careers out of handling edge conditions, we should know better.<p>If a kid punches you because he hates himself, should you punch him back?

What if a kid punches you because he likes you, but he has an abusive family environment and punching is the only way he knows to express affection?

What if a kid punches you because he has low self esteem and he's jealous of how smart you sounded in class just now?<p>The answer to everything up there is not ""JUST PUNCH THE FUCKER"" or ""JUST HUG THE FUCKER.""

The first has a higher likelihood of getting you left alone.  The second will probably make it worse!  If you're a small kid and you try to give them a hug, that's different from if you're a big kid.  They could say the small kid is only being friendly because he's too wimpy to fight back.

It's so ingrained into the head of the good kids that they are terrified of fighting even to defend themselves.<p>Thus, bullies get to bully with no fear. There's no consequence. Whereas when a weaker kid fights back, even if the bully is strong enough to ""win"" the battle, he still gets <i>hit</i> <i>in</i> <i>the</i> <i>mouth</i> and does not like it. Bullies much prefer low-hanging fruit that doesn't fight back.<p>My children, when school age (maybe not 1st grade, but certainly by junior high), will be sat down and have the following explained to them:<p>""You are <i>allowed</i> to defend yourself. You will avoid physical conflict whenever possible, but should you ever be physically threatened or subject to ongoing torment, you have the GREEN LIGHT to use physical force to protect yourself, OR to assist a friend who is unable to protect themselves.""<p>""You may get in trouble with your school. THIS IS OK. Your well-being is more important than their rules. If you get suspended for three days, then I'll take three days off work and we'll keep up with your studies. I will be on your side. Do not let concern over the school rules stop you at all from defending yourself.""<p>""However, you will never use force to do anything but protect yourself or your friend. If I find that YOU have been the aggressor, I will <i>smite</i> you.""<p>I'll probably need to work on that speech a bit between now and then, but you get the idea. :)<p>I was lucky. I was never the small or weak one. Even still, I can think back to a couple of situations where fear of parental response prevented me from protecting myself as well as I should have. My children will have it made known to them that they will not be ""assumed guilty"" when a situation comes up where they physically defend themselves. No aggression towards others will be tolerated, but they will be trusted to properly use their discretion, and until they prove themselves guilty, they will be assumed innocent.",1289513412

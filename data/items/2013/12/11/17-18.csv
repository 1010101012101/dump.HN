The latter is already coverable by a utility patent on the physical tools.  The former is simply a description of steps, and in the case of robotic surgeries it will invariably be software.<p>But we&#x27;re not just talking about software here.  The U.S. is trying to make medical procedures patentable in all but the most manual cases.  In other words, only if a procedure can be done completely by hand is it exempt; the moment you use any sort of &quot;medical device&quot; in the surgery then the steps themselves become protected intellectual property, in addition to the utility patents on the devices themselves.<p>Source:  <a href=\"http://keionline.org/node/1825\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://keionline.org/node/1825</a>",1386784716

Insofar as Linux is a contender there, for the average individual user, its largely in the form of ChromeOS rather than traditional desktop linux distros, not because ChromeOS is more feature appropriate, but because of its backing.<p>There is a reason Microsoft is running negative ads about ChromeOS and not about, say, Ubuntu.<p>From a development perspective, Linux has been adequate as a main OS for a long-time, though better virtualization solutions make having to choose one OS full-time -- or use comparatively awkward dual-boot solutions -- less a reality.",1386784651

It made people feel bad to be on food stamps so they rename it so they won&#x27;t feel bad. But you can&#x27;t really call them food stamps anyway as they have become their own form of currency and you can buy nearly anything with them. So now it&#x27;s become the &quot;here&#x27;s some money we hope you&#x27;ll buy food with&quot; program. Not to say that there are no people who do need these programs to survive through tough times. I&#x27;m sure there are many out there who do actually, truly need these programs and I&#x27;m happy that they are there to help them. But at the same time, one must recognize that over time such programs may lead to severe problems that require yet more programs, i.e. money, to &quot;fix&quot;.<p>On the other side, if the government installed such controls as you describe then that part would potentially get worse simply because of abuses by the government on its people. Plus, government controls often do not have the intended outcome anyway resulting in worse problems than what they were trying to solve in the first place. Also, keep in mind that politicians often offer to increase the money to these programs to increase their power in their own little corner of the political landscape. Or to buy votes. Or to attack political opponents. I can easily recall the accusations that one party must not be elected because &quot;THEY WERE GOING TO TAKE AWAY YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY!!&quot; even though that party did not claim wanting to do such a thing. The more control you hand over to the government over its people, the more control that it desires to get in the future.<p>Some would say that welfare is already supposed to provide just enough to survive on to help that person. But with some groups that use the money clearly for things outside of surviving, some groups that are constantly redefining what &quot;surviving&quot; means, and some groups blatantly using welfare measures to buy votes to obtain power means that welfare will almost always not be the solution to the problem at hand.<p>Taking care of humans fairly is a rather difficult thing to succeed at.",1386784272

A huge number of albums are just plainly mis-tagged with the publication year, and especially for older music you have to scroll through dozens of &quot;Best of&quot;, &quot;The original&quot;, &quot;The definitive&quot; etc. as well as re-publications &quot;Re-masted&quot;, &quot;Legacy edition&quot; etc. to get to the original albums.

The 2001 recession (official dates are still, IIRC, March-November 2001, though there was, around 2004, talk that the start date maybe should have been pinned somewhat earlier, I don&#x27;t think it was ever actually revised), was, as you note, much shorter and, in part because there was a lot more access to credit, which supported a quick rebound of aggregate demand and a return to expansion and better top-line employment numbers (a number of factors, include tax policy changes which shifted the distribution of gains upwards, made it a fairly hollow expansion in which the bottom three quintiles all saw income declines and the next quintile was flat, however, which, help set the stage for a deeper recession with a much slower recovery when the bottom fell out of the housing market, since it was a lot harder for demand to rebound.)",1386784205

Maybe event-drivenness can come into play in a given system, maybe it shouldn&#x27;t; across a broad set of domains this is orthogonal to the concept of responsiveness.<p>In video games, for example, we do things that are extremely responsive compared to web stuff (last week I worked on something that had to run at 200 frames per second in order to meet requirements). Interactive 3D rendering systems are most certainly <i>not</i> event-driven; they derive their responsiveness from cranking through everything as quickly as possible all the time.<p>There are lots of different domains of software out there and they all have found different local attractors with regard to what techniques work and produce the best result.

And the free piggyback ssl means https just works too.<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://www.openshift.com/blogs/run-gradle-builds-on-openshift\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.openshift.com/blogs/run-gradle-builds-on-openshi...</a>\n[2]: <a href=\"http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2871\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://issues.gradle.org/browse/GRADLE-2871</a>",1386783359

This is something I didn&#x27;t know I was doing until I started doing Yoga regularly -- after a while, you become very aware of the weakness of your back muscles, the tension of your hamstrings (if you&#x27;re the typical male), and how the overall tendency is to tip your pelvis backward while seated, which makes your spine bulge to the rear.  And when you&#x27;re standing, you tend to tip your pelvis the <i>other</i> way (due to weak abs), leading to the &quot;beer gut&quot; phenomenon, and impinging the lower back.  It&#x27;s no wonder that people have back trouble as they get older!<p>For men especially, Yoga focuses on stretching the hamstrings, straightening/strengthening the back, and increasing range of motion in the hips and legs.

Then R^n is the set of all\nn-tuples over the real numbers.  Such an n-tuple is\na list of n numbers; e.g., (1, 3, 2.6, 1, 7) is an\nn-tuple for n = 5.<p>For positive integers m and n, an m x n (read &quot;m by\nn&quot;) (real) &#x27;matrix&#x27; as a rectangular array of real\nnumbers with m rows and n columns.  Typically for\ninteger i = 1, 2, ..., m and integer j = 1, 2, ...,\nn, in m x n matrix A = [a_{ij}] a_{ij} is the\nnumber, &#x27;component&#x27;, in row i and column j.  An\nexample of a 2 x 3 matrix is<p><pre><code>     1 9  4\n     4 0 -1\n</code></pre>\n(typically surrounded with square brackets not easy\nto type without, say, TeX).<p>Typically an n-tuple x in R^n is regarded as an n x\n1 matrix.  In this way, with m x n matrix A, n x 1\nvector b, and matrix multiplication (we have yet to\ndefine) Ax, we can write Ax = b as a system of m\nlinear equations in n unknowns x, and this is the\nmost important foundation and application of linear\nalgebra.<p>(2) Similarly for positive integer n and the set of\ncomplex numbers C, C^n is the set of all n-tuples of\ncomplex numbers.  And, we can have an m x n matrix\nof complex numbers.<p>Once get very far in linear algebra, complex numbers\nbecome essential if only from the fundamental\ntheorem of algebra (that is, from factoring a\npolynomial).  In particular, eigenvalues are\nimportant, and they are often complex numbers.<p>(3) R^n and C^n are examples of &#x27;vector spaces&#x27;, but\nthere are also many other examples.<p>For a &#x27;vector space&#x27;, we have a non-empty set V of\n&#x27;vectors&#x27; and a &#x27;field&#x27; F.  Note:  A &#x27;field&#x27; is\ndefined carefully in courses in abstract algebra,\nbut the two leading examples in practice are R and\nC. Most commonly F = R or F = C, but there is also\ninterest in other fields, e.g., the integers modulo\na prime number.  Here we assume that F = R or F = C.<p>On V we have an operation &#x27;addition&#x27; denoted by +.\nSo, for vectors x in V and y in V, there is a vector\nx + y in V.  Addition is commutative so that x + y =\ny + x.  Vector addition is also associative, that\nis, for x, y, z in V,<p>(x + y) + z = x + (y + z)<p>Also there is a vector 0 in V so that for any x in V\nwe have 0 + x = x.<p>Also for x in V, there is -x in V so that x + (-x) =\nx - x = 0.<p>Or set V with operation + forms a commutative group\n(defined carefully in courses in abstract algebra).<p>On V with F we have an operation &#x27;multiplication&#x27;.\nThen for x in V and a in F, with this\n&#x27;multiplication&#x27; the &#x27;product&#x27; ax in V.<p>For x, y in V and a, b in F, we have two\ndistributive laws, (a + b)x = ax + bx and a(x + y) =\nax + ay.  Also, for 0 in F, 0x is the vector 0.  For\nthe vector 0, a0 is also the vector 0.<p>We have that (-1)x = -x.<p>For some examples of vector spaces, (A) let F = R\nand let V be the set of all monophonic audio signals\nexactly 10 seconds long, (B) let F = R and let V be\nthe set of all real valued random variables X where\nE[X^2] is finite, and (C) let F = R and for m x n\nmatrix A and n x 1 vector x and m x 1 vector b, let\nV be the set of all x such so that Ax = b (so far\nthe matrix product Ax has not been defined, but it\nwill be defined so that Ax = b is a system of m\nlinear equations in n unknowns, the components of\nx).<p>(3) For set S, x in S means that x is an &#x27;element&#x27;\nof S.<p>(4) The notation (R, R, R) = R^3 is neither good nor\nstandard.<p>The notation R^3 = R X R X R as the set theory\nCartesian product is standard.<p>Actually, we already know just what (R, R, R) is --\na 3-tuple and not a set of all 3-tuples of real\nnumbers.<p>(5) R^{m x n} is questionable notation and, anyway,\nneeds a definition.<p>(6) For the &quot;power&quot; of that mathematics, might\nillustrate that with some applications.  One of the\nmost important is solving systems of linear\nequations.  For more, a matrix can describe a linear\ntransformation, and linearity is a powerful\nassumption that commonly holds with good accuracy in\npractice.  So, vectors and matricies become powerful\nmeans of working with linear systems where a matrix\ndescribes the system and the inputs and outputs of\nthat system are vectors.<p>From G. F. Simmons, the two pillars of analysis in\nmathematics are continuity and linearity, and linear\nalgebra emphsizes both, especially linearity.<p>More examples of linearity include both\ndifferentiation and integration in calculus and the\nFourier transform.<p>(6) The definition of inverse function is wrong.\nThat definition holds only when the given function f\nis 1-1.  Even if f is not 1-1, the inverse function\nis still useful, but its values can be a set of\nvalues, that is, the inverse function is multiply\nvalued.  E.g., just take f(x) = x^2.

Whether or not those guns are lethal enough to warrant being removed from a flight is a very valid question.<p>Before we cast aspersions on the TSA agent, let&#x27;s look at it from her perspective. The TSA has rules that say replica guns are not allowed on flights. The TSA is not likely an agency that smiles upon its front line employees exercising discretion. Her options are:<p>1) to confiscate the &quot;offending&quot; item, as supported by her training and the TSA policies, or<p>2) to decide the item is not a threat and let it pass security.<p>If she takes the first option, she risks a bit of media hullabaloo being directed at the TSA. If she takes the second she risks being wrong (what if it <i>is</i> a gun and someone is shot, what if someone on the airplane sees it and panics because <i>they</i> think it is a gun,...) and being held accountable.<p>And even if she lets it go through what&#x27;s to say a supervisor who is evaluating the front line agents doesn&#x27;t take note of a deviation from training/policy and fire her then?<p>The TSA agent was acting, in my mind, <i>completely rationally</i> given the framework under which she has to act.

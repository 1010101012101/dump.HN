3469806,comment,3467782,3469702,1,0,redthrowaway,,,"Right, and perhaps it's a poor example.  That was, in fact, the first counterargument that I thought of when I wrote that comment.  I was trying to think of something that would be intuitive for the audience here, and perhaps in pursuing that goal I made a poor analogy.<p>The point is, ASL must be a <i>language</i> first, and an aid for the disabled second.  On that point, it fails.  The goal of a language is to enable communication; if less than 1% of people you are likely to interact with are capable of communicating in that language then it is of limited utility.  People who have normal hearing are generally not going to learn ASL, as the value proposition just isn't strong enough.  Because of that, even people who have hearing problems might not be incentivized to learn it, for the same reason: it just might not be that useful.<p>Now, as with any group, a shared language leads to shared culture and a sense of belonging.  That, in and of itself, will make ASL attractive to many people.  That's fine.  It fails at its intended use as a primary means of communication however, as it just doesn't let you communicate with that many people.  This, I think, is why many deaf people also learn to lipread: it allows for communication outside of the (relatively) small deaf community.",1326700654

I can't access Flickr from work but I think I have about 45 photos and 18,500 views, averaging 411/photo, and that's just from a couple of up votes on reddit/itookapicture (seldom more than 5-10). Obviously the actual distribution of views will vary quite a bit, but it's a useful starting point.<p>That being said, this guy seems to have quite an ability to take interesting photos of ordinary situations whereas I tend to save the camera for special moments so I doubt I'll ever hit 3,100 photos.

I'm sure they need the jobs, but factories are unsafe enough.  US factories can see those kinds of hours at least some of the time.  They're probably that high because they're running at capacity.<p>You're right about Apple getting singled out.  Probably because it generates the most pageviews.  I will give Apple credit, though, for at least attempting to do something about the problem.  That said, if they know when the inspections are, they can sweep an awful lot of things under the rug.<p>Many of the problems are societal.  In the US, nobody would cover up injuries.  Doctors would instead complain that you had an unsafe workplace if the conditions got out of hand.  And they could complain to OSHA if they were being exposed to toxic chemicals.  Those aren't really Apple problems, those are China problems.  That said, it's good that all this attention is being paid to this.  It's probably the only way that anything will get done.  Keeping quiet about the problems won't help anyone.",1326698560

Blurting out everything at once is too hard to distinguish from passive agressive smallness. Also, you'd best have done some work first to ensure you don't have some passive agression leaking out somewhere in the first place.<p>The right way to do this is to not say too much at first, but to also actively seek out those who value the truth. Sharing the truth like sharing intimacy -- it's best done consensually.<p>Look for those who will take substantive stands, and filter away those who are just saying things to curry favor or fit in. Welcome even those you might disagree with. Admit when the other has a point, and see what they do with that. People reveal whether they really care about the truth rather quickly. Those who do not care often reveal that unknowingly.<p>The only tact necessary is to withhold an opinion by claiming ignorance or unfamiliarity with a topic and to sincerely respect others. One can usually do both truthfully -- very few people are the world's best experts at a given thing, and few can claim to know all the details of another's situation. If you have the humility to understand this as the truth, then you can usually exercise tact without resorting to untruthfulness.",1325044779

No. It means they want to have a large reach without much maintenance. After that is accomplished, then they can worry about experience on a per device basis.<p>I don't believe it's correct to just dismiss this as garbage because the application is currently buggy.

3398535,comment,3397293,3397618,3,0,brc,,,"I've posted this before but I've made half decent money in small batches by purchasing crates of assorted goods at live auctions.  Police auctions are sometimes good for this, as they may just load a heap of stuff onto a pallet and sell the pallet as a lot.  Most people don't want to buy a pallet full of junk, but you can get lucky if you scope it out before the auction and look for valuable items.  Same goes for office liquidations - you might get a bulk lot of 10 LCD monitors or laser printers or something like that.  You can sell the first 1 or 2 on eBay, get your capital back and the rest is pure profit.  It's also easy if you buy a bulk lot because you only need to write the listing once and just keep repeating it, plus you can get a feel for what days/times bring the most bids.<p>It's not terribly scalable because you need to have transport and time to attend auctions, plus somewhere to store the stuff.  But if you have a decent sized car/pickup, proximity to auctions and a nose for a bargain, you can pick up some good pocket money with this strategy.<p>Incidentally, I think the market for the pricenomics data is precisely the same as the KBB market - detailed lookup via mobile app for people who are buying/selling regularly.  A good pawnbroker/2nd hand dealer/auctioneer will know the price point on a wide range of goods, but allowing people to purchase this information for a reasonable price will help both people starting out, and also professionals stepping outside their bread and butter.<p>I would suggest a freemium model, where the free version gives you a price range, and the pro version gives you a very direct price.",1325044355

3398497,comment,3396465,3396898,1,0,electromagnetic,,,"Railguns are worthy of note, but would likely only be worthy of PD weapons. The problem with guns is that your target moves. With the exception of missiles, every fraction of the speed of light slower your weapon is, the bigger chance you take of missing. With a round fired at .1C over 300,000KM (1 light second) you need to account for about 11 seconds of lead on your target. That's 11 seconds that they don't change their course enough for you to miss. Compare this to a laser where it's 1 second of lead.<p>> With the speeds/distances involved all of the missiles would be approaching from a very narrow cone, and a small deflection would mean a miss.<p>Not necessarily. Unless space battle becomes solely a chasing game (which would favour the defender as if you know you're a runner the majority of your PD's will be aimed out your ass). A missile can sit for any amount of time after being dropped before firing. This means you can distribute a missile or approach from opposing angles. If your ship uses turrets for PD then you know it cant easily shoot two different angles at once. If you're fighting well within your missiles ranges (because fighting at maximum range gives too much time for PD's) then it'll be very easy to launch your missiles around your target in a flank attack.",1325043420

Posting to HN, ""look at those l4m3rz at Firefox not implementing my features!

The end result is a couple of sore schoolkids and an irked teacher.  As adults, we need not let our actions devolve this way.<p>So, if this issue bothers you, you need to suck it up and stop using Firefox, or suck it up and implement the damn feature that you obviously care so deeply about.

You expect free work from people that have given you a free product, simply because they have proven themselves willing to work for you for free before?

If an intelligence agent (or subversive citizen) is using it in a country where it is banned they are going to be in trouble no matter if it is illegal in the US or not.<p><i>If</i> it was a concern for US intelligence agencies (which I don't concede it is at all) then that can easily handle it themselves - they get an executive order allowing them to run exit nodes and then what they are doing is legal. Even by the borderline argument that Tor could be illegal under SOPA would only make it a problem for people running exit nodes - use by the general population. I doubt any intelligence agency would complain about being ordered to run a Tor exit node - I think they would love it.<p>I find it bizarre that people are even talking about this, when in the same source article where this was first raised it said the following:<p><i>""Browsers implementing DNSSEC will have to circumvent and bypass criminal blocking, and in the process, they will also circumvent and bypass SOPA orders."" A successful injunction from the attorney general, Baker said, would shut down all shipments of a Web browser ""until it's been revised to the satisfaction of his staff and their advisers in Hollywood.""</i>[1]<p>The US federal government provided funding to develop and deploy DNSSEC[2], too, and that is also useful for dissidents overseas. It also helps secure communications for billions (if not trillions) of dollars in ecommerce transaction. If that is ignored, do you <i>really</i> think Tor is going to get the bill vetoed?<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57346592-281/how-sopas-circumvention-ban-could-put-a-target-on-tor/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57346592-281/how-sopas-cir...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions#DNSSEC_deployment_initiative_by_the_U.S._federal_government"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Ext...</a>",1325041524

I didn't make any distinction between omitting truth and actively lying.<p>I never really lied to people in the first place, but I would offer standard niceties. Those counted as lying and were no longer said. It's hard to say who was most offended. I <i>can</i> say that the least offended typically were somewhat antisocial themselves; those who found social norms something to analyze, rather than to follow.",1325041398

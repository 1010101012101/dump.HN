Presumably this routine integrates measured acceleration, which can be divided by hold-down-time to find the average error in inertial bias over the hold-down period.  The average error in accelerometer bias (in other words, rate at which measured ground-relative velocity deviates from true ground-relative velocity) would then be subtracted from the previous bias estimate in order to get the bias estimate to be used for the flight.<p>Edit: even though recalibration was never intended to be used in the Ariane 5, the integration routine was left in and continued to integrate acceleration measurements for 40 seconds after ignition.<p>The Ariane 5 is capable of undergoing more acceleration than the Ariane 4, so it was possible within 40 seconds of ignition for the 64-bit velocity (integral of acceleration) to overflow the 16-bit variable it was cast into at some point.  With no range checks implemented for this cast, this routine caused the computer handling the inertial guidance to crash and dump.  The autopilot saw the crash dump, but misinterpreted it as a position and attitude update.  The autopilot then adjusted the rocket nozzles to correct for the misinterpreted attitude, causing the rocket to start flying somewhat sideways through the air at high speed, leading to breakup due to aerodynamic forces.<p>Most (all?) modern launch vehicles contain small explosive charges (or lines of detonating chord) to burst fuel tanks, break up the solid fuel grain, and perhaps break up some of the more dangerous pieces if the vehicle deviates too far from the planned flight path.  Shortly after aerodynamic forces began to break up the Ariane 5, some internal automated system detected things were going very very badly and triggered the auto-destruct sequence.",1392731589

But there are web sites which are not services yet, which could still benefit from Erlang greatly. And I think (and hope) that the initial overhead of Erlang will get smaller and smaller over time as new frameworks emerge and that someday deploying your blog on top of Erlang will become viable choice :)",1392731365

With the world&#x27;s first electronic stock exchange, the NASDAQ terminal, traders could type in orders directly into a computer.<p>Peterffy didn&#x27;t want to type in the orders. He and his engineers hacked into the NASDAQ terminal and wired it up to their own computer, which traded automatically based on algorithms.<p>A senior NASDAQ official saw Peterffy&#x27;s setup and said Peterffy was breaking the rules: All orders had to be entered through the keyboard. He gave Petterfy&#x27;s group one week to fix the problem.<p>Peterffy and his engineers came up with a solution. They built a robot with rubber fingers that typed entries into the keyboard.

Most SLCs achieved this by taking a T1 (traditionally 24 POTS lines) and performing an analog-to-digital conversion AND compression (instead of giving you 64KB of bandwidth per channel, you got 16KB) to increase the number of voice lines that could be served.<p>So instead of deploying 96 pairs of copper, for 10 miles, at a cost of $$$$$ per mile, you deployed 2-4 pairs of copper for 10 miles at $ per mile plus the fixed cost of $$ for the purchase/lease of a SLC.<p>(The downside is the occasional line break caused by a car accident or hungry squirrel, would take down an entire neighborhood instead of just one customer)<p>On the provider side, you needed a provider that would deliver you PRIs with echo cancellation turned OFF on your channels.<p>Echo cancellation helped telecom providers, again, by saving bandwidth. With the advent of packet-switched networks, your voice calls were converted to digital audio, and sliced into chunks of 64KB, and delivered as packets to the remote switch.<p>Silence suppression was a common feature of packet-switched networks -- instead of delivering 64KB packets of silence, you delivered nothing, which allowed providers to reduce the aggregate amount of bandwidth they needed to service all the calls transiting their network.<p>With echo cancellation, it further increased the amount of packets the provider could drop to the floor which reduced their overall bandwidth needs. Your provider most likely marketed this new technology as &quot;better quality voice calls&quot; (remember the AT&T commercials inviting you to test the quality of their &#x27;new digital network&#x27; for yourself, by calling 10-10-288-something and listening to a clip of Whitney Houston singing?)<p>The problem is, echo cancellation generates false positives on modem calls, and the subsequent silence suppression would cause 56K calls to retrain down to a level that would eventually not be effected by the echo cans, resulting in a 31.2Kbps or 33.6Kbps call.<p>This was a highly annoying discovery for providers who invested in brand new 56K-capable modem equipment.<p>Normally, you could just ask your provider to turn off the echo cans, but after the Telecom Act of 1996, a flood of new providers entered the market who were merely just reselling other larger carriers. This was a problem as your reseller probably didn&#x27;t know what echo cans were, let alone had the &quot;pull&quot; to ask the underlying provider to turn it off on your behalf.<p>As an ISP, if you couldn&#x27;t get echo cans turned off, then your  only option was to cancel and find a new provider.",1392731309

With COM, if you preserved binary compatibility you didn&#x27;t need to re-compile a client if you compiled a new version of a DLL it calls.  In .NET it&#x27;s even more forgiving.

Horrible position esp. hated the IT they were using, annoying mid-level management ... I hated not being listened to when i had something meaningful to contribute, not to mention 24/7 on-call and a meager raise (3%, but was prorated to 1.2% because i hadnt been there a year) Stayed there for 1.5 years.Nov 1 2013 : I had, had enough - voluntarily quit the position  to start my own company in a field I hadnt formally worked in before, but learned a good amount at the previous position.Today (02/18/14) : Been at it since Nov 1, and for lack of a better word: its been real tough. The results: I&#x27;ve lacked a huge network with people who could help me (I&#x27;ve spent a lot of these past months networking within 50mi of my area making more contacts)\n-I&#x27;ve reached out to endless contacts I&#x27;ve known in the past (for intros to people who may be applicable first customers) - with varied results: \n- some have provided me some good leads to people to talk to, some just dont respond at all, some are wishy-washy saying they know the CEO at X large co and I&#x27;d be happy to make an intro (then I never hear anything back - after multiple followups) \n-I&#x27;ve done some cold emailing (via Linkedin) - people claiming they arent the right person, I reply back with apologies, can you lead me to the right person? Thank you. Nothing back..I&#x27;m just really at a loss, I told myself Nov 1 13&#x27; that I wouldn&#x27;t be going back to a corporation if I could help myself.

Normal exchanges used a simple 8-bit DAC and ADC, but when a 56k modem was attached it would have to switch to a different mode. Effectively, the remote modem was moved from the ISP to the exchange, with the digital part of the POTS network transmitting de-modem-ed data, rather than a digital representation of an analogue signal encoding digital data, which is what happens with slower speeds.<p>So yes, the 56k signal was transmitted over an analogue line, but no the 56k signal was not transmitted over the main POTS network. Work beyond 56k was not pursued because the underlying digital telephone network could not actually transmit data at a higher rate.<p>This is also where the 64kb/s speed of an ADSL line comes from by the way. That just extends the digital part of the POTS network to the house. ADSL allows a slightly higher data rate (64kb/s rather than 56kb/s) because it has a side channel that carries the control signals such as dialling and flow control, whereas 56k modems had to send flow control and error correction in-band.",1392728606

7257877,comment,7257005,7257652,1,0,masklinn,,,"It seems you&#x27;re confusing with an other one. Here&#x27;s an excerpt from the wiki on flight 501:<p>> The Ariane 5 reused the inertial reference platform from the Ariane 4, but the Ariane 5&#x27;s flight path differed considerably from the previous models. Specifically, the Ariane 5&#x27;s greater horizontal acceleration caused the computers in both the back-up and primary platforms to crash and emit diagnostic data misinterpreted by the autopilot as spurious position and velocity data. Pre-flight tests had never been performed on the inertial platform under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions so the error was not discovered before launch. During the investigation, a simulated Ariane 5 flight was conducted on another inertial platform. It failed in exactly the same way as the actual flight units.<p>> <i>The greater horizontal acceleration caused a data conversion from a 64-bit floating point number to a 16-bit signed integer value to overflow and cause a hardware exception</i>. Efficiency considerations had omitted range checks for this particular variable, though conversions of other variables in the code were protected. The exception halted the reference platforms, resulting in the destruction of the flight.<p>Although the article partially disagrees with tinco: it looks like formal verification was only implemented after flight 501:<p>> The launch failure brought the high risks associated with complex computing systems to the attention of the general public, politicians, and executives, resulting in increased support for research on ensuring the reliability of safety-critical systems. <i>The subsequent automated analysis of the Ariane code was the first example of large-scale static code analysis by abstract interpretation</i>.",1392728600

7257869,comment,7255035,7256743,2,0,VLM,,,"He&#x27;s more correct than you think.  Since the 90s there&#x27;s been an explosion of sound card based digital modulation schemes.  Usually you see a waterfall spectrum from 0 to &quot;whatever&quot; and you click where you want to operate.  Essentially the attached SSB transceiver is a linear transverter from audio to some RF.<p>So instead of tuning your radio to 7.070 MHz and clicking on the computer waterfall at 1200 Hz (aka operating at 7.0712 MHz) you just unplug the radio from the computer, use speaker and mic instead of something plugged into speaker and mic jacks and click on 18 KHz or whatever.<p>In the early days of PSK-31 and other modes you did demos at radio club meetings and whatever by just letting it rip over the speakers.  Loud and annoying but works pretty well across a room or further.<p>The main limitation is most SSB communications radios cut out around 3400 Hz at the high end so the software that is written for sound card digital modes cuts out somewhere above that, but sometimes not as high as 25 KHz or whatever, because 99% of the users and devs will never fool around with ultrasound.<p>Because I like to use a HF modulation mode called Olivia I mostly use an old version of DM780 software (from when it was free) and multipsk (free) although I could use FLDIGI (which is also free).  In my infinite spare time I&#x27;ll see what unnatural limits have been built into the software.  This topic of ultrasound networking comes up on HN like clockwork every week or so, so I&#x27;ll report back next time.<p>(Edited to add, one thing I like about multipsk is the, um, innovative UI.  Go to images.google.com and take a look.)",1392728526

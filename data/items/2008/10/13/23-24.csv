I was pointing out and arguing against the blind 'America is the Greatest' thinking that it demonstrated. The fact that the poster felt so sure about it without the need to provide any evidence was proof enough I believe.<p>In this context I feel that using the very word (jingoist) that the poster said he was trying to avoid was certainly justified. Perhaps I could have avoided directly using the word 'ignorant'.<p>Anyway it doesn't surprise me that some people might disagree with my post. But I believe the prevalence of this attitude is a truth and actually an important truth. Possibly a substantial cause of the financial problems the original article was about.",1223942360

331736,comment,330987,330987,0,0,startingup,,,"There is a different strand of criticism of Krugman (and the neo-Keynesians in general) that is quite apart from his politics. At some level, this is a criticism of the modern economic profession itself, and its worship of mathematical models. This is conceptually analogous to but quite distinct from the Wall Street addiction to quantitative/stochastic modeling, which is behind much of the present mess. Krugman represents the pinnacle of that mathematical tradition. To be fair, Milton Friedman, ideologically the polar opposite of Krugman, has also faced similar criticism.",1223942154

While I'm sure there has been the occasional argument about who deserves it more, I'm not aware of anyone anywhere who's made the argument that the economics prize is a ""little myopic"", nor do I know who might be spreading that ""word"" either.<p>Basically: you are making a baldly partisan, political argument where none is appropriate.

There's zero pay-down with interest-only loans, which many of the teaser-programs were.  There's NEGATIVE pay-down with interest-deferred loans (which many of the teaser-programs were).<p>> Basically, it is easier to afford a house if it maintains its value after you buy it, because the equity gives you more flexibility in refinancing.<p>Refinancing makes a house more affordable only if interest rates decline, and then only if you don't take money out.",1223939664

9788760,comment,9775512,9783593,0,0,to3m,,,"I worked nearly entirely on console games. Generally the frame rate would be decided early on (either after prototyping, or because you&#x27;ve been given a pile of old code to start from and that runs at a given rate), and would stay fixed. The games I worked on were split near enough 50/50 between 30Hz and 60Hz, with one game update per render, and usually some provision for handling one-off frame drops due to rendering taking too long. (That&#x27;s not supposed to happen, but it can, particularly if you&#x27;re trying to hit 60Hz.)<p>I can&#x27;t say with any confidence what people tend to do for PC - I don&#x27;t play PC games, and I last worked on a PC game in 2006 - but supposedly one tactic I&#x27;ve heard is used is to interpolate object positions and properties when it comes to rendering. So you run the logic at a fixed rate (to avoid the problems I alluded to in my previous post), and save both current object states and previous object states. Then, when it comes to render, you&#x27;ll be needing to render the game state as it was at some point between the most recent game state you have and the one before that - so you can imagine your latest state as a keyframe, and the previous state as a keyframe, and just interpolate between them.<p>I imagine this can be a bit tricky to retrofit, though, so no doubt many ports from console to PC just decide to use the same frame rate as used on the console. But I&#x27;m guessing a bit here. Unreal and the like might just do it all for you these days anyway. Maybe the Batman programmers just forgot to tick the right checkbox ;)",1435370284
9788759,comment,9786709,9787867,0,0,Gibbon1,,,"I disagree R&D is usually a faction of the cost needed to go into production. The large the number of units, the greater that ratio is. For mass produced products it can be 10:1. Consider if you&#x27;re going to ship 10,000 of something that costs $25 to produce. You need a $250,000 just for inventory. You need a way to assemble, test, and ship the product. Deal with 10,000 customers.<p>Designing the production flow, jigs and fixtures, quality control, training up people, all requires money and engineering time. The business and sales side of things requires time and money.<p>I&#x27;ve seen numbers of products stall out because the developers fail to get enough funding to go into production. Also in a lot of cases markets move slowly. You can introduce a product and the buyers will just nibble for the first year or two if you&#x27;re not an established name.

The language that can pull this off will be the next big thing, no question.<p>Go isn&#x27;t(the next big thing). it could have been great, but its type system is just horrible once one digs a little bit. No co-variance or contra-variance so extremely limited polymorphism, devs having to do compiler&#x27;s job with type assertions everywhere, a clunky error system(that could have at least benefited from some syntactic sugar to make it less verbose...).

Good unit tests must have an independent oracle of truth or else you aren&#x27;t testing anything.  As a practical matter you should only write tests for code that materially impacts the business (or you are just wasting everyone&#x27;s time ).  Instead of writing regression or integration tests, which are hard (hence the need for testing), people absent mindedly write unit tests and point at code coverage.",1435368568

We&#x27;re arguing about it because you do not find that evidence compelling, and I&#x27;m attempting to tease out where you&#x27;ve gotten your facts about this intent. I&#x27;ll have to dig up the SCOTUS case for the DC handgun ban being overturned (2007?) to see why Roberts believed in an individual right, or believed that it was to be found in the Founder&#x27;s intent. You appear to be basing yours on our 2015 grammar rules, which doesn&#x27;t quite cut it if we&#x27;re going all way back to 1787. Also, keep it mind it was manifestly clear for years before it was challenged in court :)",1435366820

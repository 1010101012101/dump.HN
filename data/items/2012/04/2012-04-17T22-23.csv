On net, Alice sells all her stocks to Eve and gathers in $100 every day.<p>If Eve stays home, instead Alice unloads perhaps six of her stocks to Bob at $10.05 each, and is still holding on to four of them.  She doesn't want to end the day with $60.30 and four stocks she doesn't want, so she unloads the remaining stocks to Chuck and nets $100.10.  Except that Chuck takes Mondays off, so on Monday she might end up selling to Chris and only finish with $99.90.<p>So what Eve (HFT) really accomplishes here is she grabs 10 cents of Alice's potential profit on most days or 10 cents of Alice's loss on Monday.  Alice is happy with this arrangement because she gets the certainty of getting her $100 each day for the minimum effort.  Eve is happy because she's grabbed an average profit of 6 cents per day (40 cents for T-F, -10 cents for M) in exchange for taking on a little bit of risk.<p>The real loser in this scenario is Freida, who is trying to do the same thing as Eve but is a little bit slower.",1334703214

For example, in some markets companies are willing to take a loss on advertising (in the sense that conversions times conversion rate is less than advertising cost), because they value acquiring a customer highly. Sometimes they even are willing to pay more to acquire a customer <i>than the (direct) lifetime value</i> of that customer, if the goal is to build up critical mass to break into a network-effects-heavy market. At the other end, in some markets, prices are based on fairly short-term returns, so people pay $0.50 only if there's a reasonable expectation of > $0.50 in conversions.",1334702628

I was a Cisco systems engineer at one point in my life.<p>Spanning Tree Protocol: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_Tree_Protocol</a><p>STP as it's called, builds linear networks. Simple, single paths, through layer 2 (see: ethernet) networks. Think of spanning tree as a large state table tracking all MAC addresses on a network. If the state table realizes there a duplicate entries (ie: duplicate paths) for a single MAC address, it literally brings down the entire network to recreate path without duplicate entries.<p>Most managed (commercial) ethernet switches, speak the spanning tree protocol; this protocol allows synchronization of MAC tables between switches. However, by default, the vmware vswitch does not speak this protocol. This creates problems when you multi-home servers (connect a single server to multiple siwtches). The vswitch does not participate in spanning tree, and the default vswitch ""load-balances"" by transmitting frames from the various ports it has accessible. This, in the traditional switches' eyes, constitutes a loop in the network and can bring an entire ethernet domain down. This is a horrific scenario during which all participating hosts lose network access for 15 seconds or more, depending on the configuration (STP vs. RVSTP). If the vswitch remains active with it's default settings, the network may be down until a network engineer realizes the problem or the server is taken offline.<p>The reason I say ""fuck spanning tree"" is as a network engineer, I've taken entire data center's off-line due to a mistaken configuration on a ESX host (which I did not have visibility into at the time). This is obviously not a good way to go about production practices.<p>Network coordination services, like the one developed by Google, stand a good chance of replacing this antiquated protocol. Everyone in the ethernet networking world has been plagued by STP and its related quirks. I'm, for one, very happy to see its demise and hope for a future clear of such, potentially, disruptive technology with data centers.",1334701548

I speak as if I'm speaking directly to the author.<p>---<p>> its possible to read it without parsing.<p>Yes, it's possible to perform lexical analysis without parsing too.<p>> the front end of every interpreter and compiler looks pretty much the same: [diagram]<p>You forgot the step where lexical analysis occurs. This is akin to what Lisp's READ does. Except the output isn't a stream of tokens, it's a tree of tokens. So, actually, even superficially, Lisp and $OTHER_LANGUAGE front-ends are not all that different.<p>> it knows nothing about the contents of the expression. All it knows is the macro definition of for.<p>This is because the `for`-statement is akin to a special form in Lisp. When Scheme encounters IF, and assuming it doesn't get transformed into a COND, then what does it do? It does not pass the arguments to some IF macro. IF is fundamental.<p>> What should the expander do when it sees: quux (mumble, flarg) [1, 2, 3] { foo: 3 } grunch /wibble/i<p>It expands it. The expander should not see a stream of characters, as you show in that example, it should see a tree. The expander does not care what the original stream of characters was, nor should it.<p>READ isn't the point. READ is a way of turning a stream of characters into a data structure. The only time an expander cares about the stream is when it's a reader macro, like in Common Lisp. Otherwise, once the stream has been converted into some tree-like structure, syntax is gone. It just so happens we can convert the tree back into syntax in a standard way (most of the time, at least).<p>This is what makes Lisp/Scheme different from C. Macros in C operate on streams of characters, and do string insertion and deletion. This isn't true with Lisp, which does node insertion/deletion/manipulation on a tree. In other words, Lisp makes changes to structure/semantics, not syntax.<p>> If youve ever wondered why Lisp weirdos are so inexplicably attached to their parentheses, this is what its all about. Parentheses make it unambiguous for the expander to understand what the arguments to a macro are, because its always clear where the arguments begin and end.<p>No, it's not that Lisp weirdos are attached to parentheses. They're attached to regularity. As said above, the expander doesn't give a single flying fsck about parentheses. An expander could expand DOTIMES[{x, 5}, SETQ[a, a+5]] just as well as it could (DOTIMES (X 5) (SETQ a (+ a 5)). In fact, Lisp started as this first syntax (to a degree), and it worked fine. See the book Anatomy of Lisp, which is written entirely using this syntax.<p>The field of lexical analysis and parsing is well developed. Lexers and parsers can amazingly be written in a way that things aren't ambiguities to the computer. Maybe to the human, but not the computer.<p>In conclusion, I do think homoiconicity is the point: that the language's representation as a data structure is accessible and transformable. The stream of characters used to represent this structure does not matter at all.",1334700311

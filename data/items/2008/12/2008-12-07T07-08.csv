I'm not saying you don't want to know about early stage competitors...but I've been amused to note over the years that 90% of my ""new competitors"" have disappeared within a year or two.<p>My first company actually had a company that <i>hired</i> me to do some of their development work (it was on Open Source software, so I would get the benefits, as well...they were just paying me to do something I was going to do anyway).  They had several million in VC money.  They also hired my current co-founder to do UI work and some other stuff (he did contract work for me on a regular basis back then).  Clearly they'd read all about what I was doing, since I was never too shy about how I was building my products and my company, and decided to spend their way into the market in direct competition with me.  I let them (though I didn't let them use my name, or my company name, in any way to imply endorsement or involvement in their products).  They were out of my market in less than a year, and completely dead within 24 months.<p>What I'm saying is that competition is rarely as scary as they seem, so don't obsess over it too much.  It can make you give up on a good idea and something you're enthusiastic about before you really even know anything.",1228636629

388749,comment,388704,388704,0,0,rfurmani,,,"I think the comments by ""Lowell & Salzman L I E"" rebut this well:<p>The methodological problem in the study is it, surprisingly, uses the narrow employment designation of ""science and engineering occupation"". The National Science Foundation specifically warns, �??The S&E labor force does not include just those in S&E occupations. S&E skills are needed and used in a wide variety of jobs.�?? However, the study used a 4.8 million figure for science-related jobs, which is the number for those in occupations formally defined as S&E, even though nearly 13 million workers say they need at least a bachelor's degree level of knowledge in science and engineering fields in their jobs. In other words, the study reached its conclusion primarily by ignoring about 8 million people in US labor force. That appears to be reason the study arrived at the claim that US has about three times as many S&E graduates as S&E job openings each year, even though there is no evidence of massive unemployment among recent graduates in these fields.<p>The broader problem with the study is it assumes a ""bean counting"" approach to what is dynamic in nature. After all, there was not even an Internet economy two decades ago, so to assume that we have plenty of talented people, assumes that we have created all the innovations we need and, therefore, American companies should stop trying to invent and innovate. A market economy can never have too many talented people, since, as we have seen, smart employers and entrepreneurs will utilize this talent to improve all our lives. <i></i>* -- Pages 10-11 of Talent Search: Job openings and the need for Skilled Labor in US Economy, NFAP Policy Brief, Mar 2008 <a href=""http://nfap.com/pdf/080311talentsrc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nfap.com/pdf/080311talentsrc.pdf</a>",1228636380
388748,comment,388714,388742,0,0,jwtanner,,,"Agreed when it comes to online streaming video, Mark Cuban is belligerent, and just plain wrong. Maybe this touches a cord, having founded the massively overvalued Broadcast.com ( where is that now? yahoo video? ).<p>But on any subject other than online video, I love Cuban, his blog, and his excellent basketball team.",1228636023
388747,comment,388704,388704,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"<i>""Salzman says that reports citing low U.S. international rankings often misinterpret the data. Review of the international rankings, which he says are all based on one of two tests, [...] show the U.S. is in a second-ranked group, not trailing the leading economies of the world as is commonly reported.""</i><p>If I am understanding that correctly, that is not so much <i>misinterpreting the data</i> as <i>not being able to frickin read</i>.<p><i>Misinterpreting data</i>, to me, signals an improper application of statistics to some raw data to assert something.<p>Not being able to look at a grouped list of rankings and realize that just because a certain group <i>as a whole</i> is below another group <i>as a whole</i> does not imply that every country in the second group is below every country in the first group is, well, sheer idiocy, not merely <i>misinterpretation</i>.<p>If the basis of the 'US is behind in math' idea is really that policy types and journalists can't properly interpret the set of rankings, then it really scares me that they are in charge of our public discourse/policy.",1228635752
388746,comment,388473,388530,0,0,tdavis,,,"<i>the real world is like high school</i><p>I'm interested to hear your argument on this, mostly because I've found the real world to be nothing like high school. When it comes to ""Web 2.0"" startups right now, sure, today's ""hotness"" might be nothing tomorrow, but the companies that rely on sheer high school-like popularity will fail sooner or later, just like those types of people eventually failed following high school.<p>In cases of direct correlation, I at least see it working both ways.  Yes, there will be edge cases; certain people seem to be able to make a living online without actually providing anything of real worth, but this is hardly confined to the Web; tabloids have been doing it for decades.",1228635728

388742,comment,388714,388714,0,0,randomwalker,,,"It must be noted that Cuban has been writing highly speculative, badly spelled rants about Youtube since well before they got acquired. Most of his claims, including the one that Google would get ""sued to oblivion"" if they bought Youtube, never panned out. He clearly has an agenda on this, and has been wrong all along; there's no reason to listen to him now.<p>For a laugh, see <a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2006/09/17/the-coming-dramatic-decline-of-youtube/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2006/09/17/the-coming-dramatic-decli...</a> and <a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2006/12/27/ripping-on-gootube-again2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2006/12/27/ripping-on-gootube-again2...</a>",1228635427

Middle-of-the-road reviews rarely make it through, and when they do, they are typically short and uninsightful. Reviews that draw the most attention are those at the extremes.<p>Human beings are generally more prone to extreme dissatisfaction than extreme satisfaction. It's in our nature. When is the last time you thought, ""Man, that person drives <i>SO</i> well!"" or ""My bill is <i>SO</i> low this month!""?<p>In the case of Lulu, the comments will heavily skew to the negative since ""satisfied customers"" will likely still be dating the guy (and thus not posting reviews) and dissatisfied ones will have every incentive to write vindictive comments in a last attempt to ""get even"". And those who are initially angry with the guy but later change their minds are likely to write a review during the angry phase and forget about it later, when their opinion of him has moderated. The end result is that most of the guys on the site will be portrayed in a much more negative light than is actually merited.<p>In terms of its user base, it's really just catering to the female equivalent of guys who engage in ""slut shaming"". But it's more socially acceptable because the app targets men instead of women, and men are expected to be more psychologically durable.",1365620199

The ringleader was able to get five or six key technical employees to mutiny with him, and that would have been sufficient to jeopardize ongoing operations.   His demands were met, and they were able to stay with initial company.  No retribution ever occurred, and they had several successful years as employees.<p>Another attempt at clear-cut mutiny that I've seen, was a technical leader who was not fond of his manager, reach out to a competing organization (In a clear cut Red/Blue scenario) in the company, and volunteered to ""take all his employees over"" to that organization.  The manager, for whatever reason, forwarded the email to the technical leader's manager, and that technical leader was then terminated the next morning for ""insubordination.""  - Over the next two to three months every single member of that team resigned their jobs in protest, causing disruption for the next several quarters at the company.

There needs to be some analysis of the why to determine that.<p>>It indicates that men are at a disadvantage. It doesn't matter what causes the disadvantage, it's still a fact. Of course, when men are at a disadvantage the reason is never expected to be gender roles or discrimination.<p>False. This is not how statistics work. There could be other confounding factors that are relevant. For instance, of the women who would become homeless how many are forced into some sort of prostitution scheme from which they can't escape? How many die early in homelessness because they are at a survival as homeless person disadvantage? You are not providing enough data, just cherry picking context free numbers as if it meant something.<p>>>Quey: how does the suicide give women an ""uppper hand"" this is a personal choice<p>>If you think social issue like suicide can be categorized as ""personal choice"", you don't know much about depression and suicide. There are factors that increase risk to suicide, like poverty and depression, which are quite prevalent in males.<p>Maybe. So what advantages to women have. Again, you need to explain a causal relationship of advantage, not just cherry pick numbers as if it were meaningful.<p>About the dating stuff: your stat makes no sense with regards to genetics. Everyone gets a  X chromosome, some get 2 of them. Of course there will be more attributable genetic lineage to women, wheres a guy who only produces daughters will not necessarily be identifiable in a few generations from his sister who passes on the same X chromosome to ~50% of her offspring. Also, why does this genetic number prove evidence for ""do nothing""? That is conflating two similar numbers pointlessly. Again, I suggest you learn some simple statistics.<p>As for the initiation thing: that is not a disadvantage to males. A couple reasons:<p>First of all, except for people who have 0 social skills initiation is really not hard.<p>Second, initiation must be invited, putting half the onus in the woman's hands (again, there are cues and signaling for this) - the act of asking or a date or starting a conversation is quite far into the courting process.<p>Third, simply choosing the best candidate is not - ever been part of a hiring process? Sometimes all the candidates are shitty and you have to choose ""no hire"", this is a problem.<p>Fourth do you really think women just sit there and do nothing in dating but wait for a candidate to come along? I doubt that, otherwise why would there be a giant business targeting women with things like ""how to make guys notice you"", and ""improve your dating potential"".<p>Fifth: In the traditional role, women have the following disadvantage: they are the ones with the job of keeping men around far more often than men keeping a woman around. Once the relationship is established, the woman has to keep the man happy. (again - big buisness in magazines with articles like ""keep your man happy and around"", ""how to prevent him from cheating"" and the like).<p>Finally your linked article presupposes the conclusion it reaches, and ignores in its analysis any other factors.",1365619415

5527108,comment,5524528,5526278,1,0,bradleyland,,,"> So here's the point for other designers of user interfaces. When your use is in a text box, TAB might take them out without them realizing, and then hitting ENTER or SPACE might perform an action they really aren't expecting, and didn't want. perhaps you should design the interface so that the button they get to after the text box does not perform an irreversible action.<p>After typing my reply in the other thread, I read far enough down the page to get to this entry, and I have to say I agree 100% with what you've said here. The fact that pressing [TAB, space] sends the email irreversibly is dangerous, and can pretty easily happen by accident when typing quickly.<p>Having said that, the behavior of TAB moving between form elements is a long standing behavior. Many ""power users"" use it to great effect, but it's discoverability is very poor. The solution is a tough compromise though. In Gmail, many users rely on the [TAB, space] sequence to send email. I do the same thing on Hacker News. When I finish my comment, I use [TAB, space] to submit my comment. The people who write the software are loath to give that up.<p>My feeling is that within the rich text editing area of an email message, TAB ought to insert a tab character, but I'm not sure how difficult that is. The TAB keypress is handled by the browser, so if the Gmail devs were to go through the trouble of trapping TAB and inserting the tab character in to the text area, they'd be breaking the expected behavior of the web browser. In that way, this solution creates another problem. Which one is ""right""?<p>It's a bit of a paradox. If nothing else, I hope this helps shed some light on why these design decisions aren't always as straight forward as they seem.",1365619054

5527030,comment,5524528,5525770,2,0,bradleyland,,,"All understandable points. I'll put out a couple of suggestions. Keep in mind that when troubleshooting, these are all guesses. They're not intended to imply that you don't have a problem. Also try to keep in mind that there may be some small detail you've overlooked that is causing the behavior you're observing. If you're dead set on insisting that the behavior happens the way you've described and there are no other possibilities, then you should stop reading here.<p>As troubleshooters, we often try to fill in the blanks with what we perceive as small pieces of missing information. This isn't an individual assault, but rather learned behavior. I'm damn good with a computer, but my #1 rule of troubleshooting is to assume that any ""truth"" about what I've observed can be invalidated through empiricism.<p>Enough hedging, let's see if we make any progress in troubleshooting the problem you experienced :) What we know so far:<p>* Pressing the TAB key results in an email being sent<p>* Other users report that pressing TAB doesn't send the email<p>We accept these as truths, but with two caveats: 1) they may be disproved or refined at any time (we aren't sentimentally attached to them, ego be damned), 2) there may be some additional information that is not yet obvious, so the list shouldn't be considered complete<p>What can we tease from this information?<p>1) Can you get the behavior to occur predictably? If you open a new compose window and press TAB, does the email send every time?<p>2) What is the normally expected behavior of TAB? In most web browsers, the TAB key is used to move focus from one form element to another. In Windows, the ""focus"" can move to buttons as well. In OS X, the focus navigation using TAB is constrained to text fields and lists by default, but can be configured to ""All Controls"" through the Keyboard preference pane.<p>3) What processes are available to <i>intentionally</i> send an email? That I am aware of, you can: click the send key, use the keyboard shortcut ctrl+return or cmd+enter (Windows/OS X). Use TAB to move focus to the ""Send"" button and press the spacebar/return/enter.<p>4) What small pieces of information might be missing? We've already ruled out browser extensions, so that's a good start. Try to think of any other software that uses global keyboard shortcuts or performs automation.<p>My pet theory (guess) would be that you're pressing TAB expecting that the TAB character is inserted in to the text field, but this is actually causing focus to move to the ""Send"" button. From there, a press of the spacebar, return, or enter key is sending the email. This is very easy to do when typing. If you can't regularly reproduce the behavior by a simple press of the TAB key, I'd say this gives this theory a higher probability of correctness. If you <i>can</i> reproduce the behavior by simply pressing TAB, then you can discard this theory.<p>Let me know if you have any thoughts on these items.",1365618490

5527020,comment,5525702,5526556,5,0,lgeek,,,"> The way they could take over the network is by crafting a new blockchain, forging fake transactions or even claiming that they own all bitcoins. If they solve blocks faster than the rest of the network, soon their malicious chain would become longer and therefore accepted by all clients! Clients always trust the longest chain because it takes the most work to make, so you would have to control most of the mining power to fake anything for long.<p>This is incorrect. Having 51% or more of the computing power of the network doesn't allow you to replace the whole blockchain (there are checkpoints, and it gets more difficult as you want to replace a bigger part of it). You also can't forge new transactions, since transactions need to be signed by the sender.<p>Basically the only practical attack (assuming no serious bugs in the clients) is a double spend: they could pay out of their own wallet a sum X to a third party, the third party checks that the transaction has Y confirmations (remember, as Y grows, it gets more difficult to pull this off), they receive whatever they've bough from the third party, and then they start pushing a different and longer block not including the transaction.",1365618410

They also rely on the inherent supply characteristics of the underlying commodity to control the supply of the currency.<p>Fiat currencies rely on the issuing government (or participating governments, in the case of something like the Euro) accepting it for taxes, fines, and government services for the same purpose, as paying some or all of these is common enough that it provides demand for the currency, and rely on active management by a central bank to control supply of the currency.<p>Bitcoin's mechanism for control of the supply of the currency are algorithmic, and much has been said about them, but the value basis is ... less clear.",1365618075

That hasn't been achieved.\n</code></pre>\nYes, it has. Fusion produces energy; the energy you have to put in to initiate fusion does not magically disappear. Thus, if you can do fusion <i>at all</i>, you will end up with more total energy than you started with.<p>What has not been achieved is <i>capturing</i> enough of that resultant energy in a form (such as electricity) in which it can be used to keep the reaction going. That step, however, is completely irrelevant to a rocket engine. The energy released by fusion is largely kinetic energy, and that is exactly what you want in rocket exhaust, no need to go through a lossy conversion step.<p><pre><code>  If the fusion reaction produces less power than it requires, the designers would be better off using the source electrical power to drive an ion thruster.\n</code></pre>\nNot so. If the fusion reaction generates <i>any energy at all</i>, then that is better than just using your electrical power source by itself, for exactly the same reason that it's better to use a starter motor to initiate ignition of gasoline in your car than it is to try to run your car off of a weak starter motor. This is true even if you have no way of using the engine to recharge your battery.<p><pre><code>  If this project were to succeed, it would instantly replace the existing approaches (i.e. tokamak and laser inertial confinement) as the most promising candidate for large-scale fusion power generation.\n</code></pre>\nNo, it wouldn't. That would only happen if the additional step were taken of discovering a highly efficient means of capturing the kinetic and radiant energy of the engine exhaust and converting it back to electricity. And research into fusion generators that work pretty much like that has been and is being done.<p>Edit: The slides at <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/636883main_FDR_talk_NIAC_2012_final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/636883main_FDR_talk_NIAC_2012_final....</a> even say:<p><pre><code>  It is assumed that initially FDR employs solar panels for house keeping power\n  Eventually it would be derived directly from nozzle flux compression\n</code></pre>\nI.e., ""once we <i>do</i> figure out how to turn this into a generator, then you don't need solar panels anymore."" But they don't know how to derive energy from the exhaust stream through the nozzle yet, so they have to keep it going with solar panels. And extracting energy from the exhaust would necessarily reduce the ISP of the engine somewhat.",1365617816

Maybe you are not defending Alan Kay's stance, but you haven't said that.<p>Plain text has existed for 50+ years; I'm sure it will exist in 100.  I'm pretty surprised you don't think so.  Actually Taleb's Antifragile talks about this exact fact -- things that have stood the test of time will tend to stick around.  For example, shoes, chairs, and drinking glasses have been around for thousands of years; they likely will be around for thousands more.  An iPad has maybe another decade.  HTML has already stood the test of time, because it has gone through drastic evolution and remained intact.<p>Your knowledge of how web standards are developed isn't quite correct.  The W3C didn't invent SSL, JavaScript, XmlHttpRequest, HTML5, or HTTP 2 (SPDY), to name a few.  Browser vendors generally implement proprietary extensions, and then they are standardized afer the fact.<p>I agree that the JS developments you list are interesting.  JavaScript is certainly necessary for the web because it lets it evolve in unexpected directions.  AJAX itself is a great example of that.<p>I'm talking about HTTP and HTML 1.0 -- they are conceptually dead simple, and both specs still use the exact same concepts and nothing more.  I don't know if HTML 1.0 had forms -- if it did not then you could certainly implement HTTP + HTML in a couple days.  I'm talking something like Lynx -- that is a valid web browser that people still use.<p>Lynx can still view billions of web pages because the web degrades gracefully, because semantic information is conveyed at a high level.  The problem with VMs is they don't degrade.  Suppose everyone gets sick of CSS.  You can throw out all your CSS tomorrow, and write MyStyleLanguage, but your HTML will still be useful.  If you encode everything in a VM, then the whole page breaks.  It's all or nothing.<p>An analogy is that HTML vs VMs is similar to compiler IR vs assembly language.  You can't perform a lot of optimizations on raw assembly code.  The information isn't there anymore; it's been ""lowered"" in to the details of machine code.  Likewise the client is able to do interesting things with non-Turing languages, because it can understand them.  Once it's lowered into a VM language, the client can't do anything but slavishly execute the instructions.  The semantic info that enables flexibility is gone by that point.<p>If you think markup will still exist in 100 years, then it's not too much more of a claim to say that markup will be transmitted by web servers and browsers.  Do you agree with that?  If that is true then TBL is not an idiot.  Alan Kay's claim is basically ridiculous.  A weaker version of it is still untrue.<p>I would say that in 100 years, HTML will still exist -- i.e. a thing that lets you separate plain text in to paragraphs, make it bold, etc.  In contrast, we will have already gone through dozens of more VMs like the JVM, Flash, JS, Dart, etc.  Certainly the JVM and Flash will be gone long before that point.

It's so tiny the whole dataset can be kept in the web browsers memory.<p>Say you have a database with 100k searchable indexed documents. You run the query ""foo"" to fetch the 10 best matches and also a count of how many documents among the total number of documents searched that matched the query. Now if someone simultaneously adds another document, the whole search query must be run again because the new document might match ""foo"" and even if it doesn't, the total document count still needs to be updated. Multiply that by a few concurrent clients and performance goes down the drain.<p>The above scenario or permutations of it is incredibly common in web applications and I don't think Meteor has a good solution to it.

So it's hard.<p>The problem with deposing bad leadership is that it usually <i>likes</i> being bad, because it's more fun for such people to be arbitrary, capricious and mean than to actually hold themselves responsible for making good decisions.

You can see the weights start differentiating themselves as training proceeds, and you'll notice that some layers tend to learn a lot faster than others.  The unit activations (neuron outputs) are similarly useful to visualize.<p>Example of weights on matrix plot: <a href=""http://imgur.com/T48Wal1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/T48Wal1</a>",1365616964

Sticking with PPS but only paying out when a block was found also wouldn't help; Eligius tried that and as soon as they hit a long period of negative luck everyone stopped mining there and the pool had to be restarted with a different payout method, screwing everyone who'd mined there previously in the process. (That issue with Eligius's payout method was actually predicted well before it actually happened.)",1365616884

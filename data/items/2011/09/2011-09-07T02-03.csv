Most of the piers between the ferry building and pier 38 are vacant for the most part blight and urban decay.

2968080,comment,2967622,2967622,127,0,xyahoo,,,"An ex-Yahoo here, using a throwaway account.<p>Yahoo's biggest problem is the creamy middle layer of managers. They are usually lifers (as in, been at Yahoo for a decade), or fresh MBAs with a Stanford degree who think that just because they sat through Management-101, they know how products should be designed.<p>This middle layer is like a Turkish harem. They're busy backstabbing each other, politicking and fucking things up. BUT NO ONE HOLDS THEM ACCOUNTABLE!  Some dick will screw up a project, and then when the team gets laid off, happily move to another one to fuck that up too. Too often I've seen engineers just get disgusted and leave; or they'll go into a depressive ""I don't care"" mode. Passive-aggressive behavior is the norm.<p>Blake, when he joined, said that ""we say 'no' to nothing, and 'no' to everything"". What he meant was: in a meeting, the manager will say 'yes' to everything; but the moment he steps outside, he'll think ""I'm not gonna do that!"".<p>Innovation is also hampered by these middle morons. Someone tries to do something innovative, and a middle cockroach will crawl out, whining that his 'team' is working on it, and they'll have something ready in (some future quarter). So you're told to back off. Then you wait. In the meantime, that middle manager will use this opportunity to ask for more reqs and expand his little fiefdom. Time will pass, and nothing will get done. And you'll be waiting, agonizing, watching competitors eat Yahoo's lunch as this middle manager fucks around.<p>And then there will be cycles of outsourcing to Bangalore and Beijing. Some middle beancounter decided that 3 engineers in India can be hired for 1 engineer in the US. (Never mind the quality of people; it's just the 3:1 ratio that matters). So now they're busy outsourcing to Bangalore. Even critical support tasks are outsourced to Bangalore. So what used to take a couple of back-and-forth emails and get fixed in an hour, now takes 3-4 days.<p>The list of Yahoo's problems are long; and C-level people are not high on that list.

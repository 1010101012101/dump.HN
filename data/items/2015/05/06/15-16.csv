That drastically limits who will use them, leading proprietary SaaS providers to dominate the market.

9499602,comment,9498785,9499348,0,0,mirashii,,,"> but it&#x27;s clear to me that this is at least where Lyft is headed<p>The opposite is actually clear to me. Lyft in SF previously had the functionality you describe Uber in Manhattan having. You put your destination in, it gives you an exact price, you decide whether to call it. When Lyft Line (the carpooling variant) was introduced, that feature was actually removed, and now with a standard Lyft ride there is no way to know your fare in advance (though there is now with Lyft Line).<p>In a similar vain, Uber gives a max fare on Uber Pool (so you know at most what it will cost, guaranteed). Uber also does do fare estimates on UberX and other rides. I&#x27;ve heard from a few drivers that they may have avoided giving exact fares in advance on UberX and others because people tend to want to use them a little bit more flexibly than get from point a to b (Stop and pick up a friend on the way, for instance).<p>Point of all of this being, it&#x27;s not clear to me that either company is committed to providing or not providing price quotes. I think we&#x27;re still in the early stages of experimentation, with features being added and removed and changed between locations all the time, and I don&#x27;t think we can yet characterize what either company is committed to doing or not.",1430927959

I was wondering if anyone had this idea that did not require manual or pre-set rules, like that the program would go passive for a few days, reading log files and learning certain log entries will be indentical minus timestamp, then some change with a small amount of text in addition, and others have never been seen (or will not match in the next stage).  Next stage turns active, and the machine filters down and sends you anything it has not seen over time and knows must be something anomolous.<p>I like fail2ban, a lot, and alternatives in that field, but when I looked at the Arch Linux package last time there were dozens of commented-out, but heavily commented nonetheless regexp template files like you describe.  I think this would be a neat machine learning thing.<p>What I am going for: use AI to train a passive entry-level sysadmin to warn you.",1430927937

I am at an interesting point in my career, though, where the company I work for decided for me to try a more managerial role (not because of age or technical impairments... it&#x27;s more complicated than that).<p>I&#x27;ve accepted the new role, just because I&#x27;d like to take a step back (as in &quot;looking at the forest and not at the trees&quot;), manage and mentor people and – why not – step out of the f*cking comfort zone. You should do that, right?<p>Anyway, now I am very puzzled about how to present myself in the near future: a 48 &quot;rookie&quot; manager (who needs to prove himself on the ground) or a seasoned, bad-ass developer with 25+ year experience on any software tier you can mention? I can sell myself very easily as the latter, while the former... I don&#x27;t know.<p>Luckily I am not losing ground on the technical side, which means that I can easily switch back to a more technical role (architect would be awesome)... but this bound me to _this_ company, which provides me the luxury of this choice in the near future.<p>Interesting times ahead... you&#x27;ll never get old unless you want to :)",1430927833

9499580,comment,9498029,9498513,0,0,soylentcola,,,"I agree overall but at the same time, it really depends on what you already have.  Sure, if you own a $400 PS4 and whatever other items you typically buy with a game console, another $300-400 for a HMD is an easier sell.<p>But I don&#x27;t have a PS4.  What I do have is a solid, modern computer since I need one for all sorts of work and play situations.  I can either spend $400-500 on a PS4 and any typical addons or I can spend $400-500 on a powerful graphics card for my computer.  And with graphics cards, performance goes up and price comes down every year.<p>The other angle I&#x27;d need to consider is what you can do with the whole package (computer + Rift or PS4 + Morpheus).  Morpheus will work on the PS4 and I&#x27;ll be able to buy PS4 content to use with the Morpheus.  The Rift will work on any capable computer and I can either buy games/content from Steam or from other sellers or I can go to Oculus Share and download all sorts of experiments and demos and games from all sorts of developers.  I can even fire up the free version of UE and start building environments to walk around in via the Rift immediately.  The power to create and share content shouldn&#x27;t be underrated, especially at this early stage.<p>I think that in 5-10 years time, if this hasn&#x27;t gone the way of 3D TV (something cool and easy to find but ultimately not that big a deal), the costs will be low enough and content will be abundant enough that it won&#x27;t matter whether you use a black box under the TV or a silver box under your desk.  But during this early time in the market, access to demos and creative tools will be a big deal.<p>When someone develops a VR teleconferencing app with depth cameras and live streaming, the betas and first release won&#x27;t be on some Sony or Microsoft game console.  They&#x27;ll be on Windows, OSX, and Linux.  When you want to use a sweet HOTAS for your VR flight simulator or enable VR support in the config of some new game, you won&#x27;t be able to do that on a Playstation or Xbox.<p>All that stuff is more than enough to get me to lean toward a $500 GPU upgrade over a $400 console purchase.  I think until VR stuff isn&#x27;t early adopter/enthusiast territory by definition, the more packaged solutions will be lacking.  Once it&#x27;s commonplace, it&#x27;ll be more a question of ergonomics like PC/console gaming is now.",1430927811

It claims to be CP in a single-node configuration (which it is) and aphyr tested it on those claims.  Remember, Jepsen isn&#x27;t about proving that a database can&#x27;t violate CAP, nor is it trying to say &quot;all databases are crap.&quot;  It&#x27;s about <i>verifying the marketing claims</i> and then determining whether there are any mitigating strategies.  The fact that many databases make unreasonable marketing claims is unfortunate, but certainly not a requirement.<p>It&#x27;s also worth posing this question in reverse: what would happen if these distributed databases were tested in a single-cluster configuration?  As noted in the most recent article on Elasticsearch, many of them (e.g. Elasticsearch, Cassandra, and Riak) acknowledge writes before fsync and can therefore lose data due to issues like `kill -9`, power loss, and other exceptional conditions, while Postgres doesn&#x27;t.  For a single-node database this robustness is very important, while he argues that it isn&#x27;t as important for a distributed one.  Because these databases aren&#x27;t <i>designed</i> to be used as single nodes, aphyr didn&#x27;t substantially ding them for that.

This means I have perfect knowledge of what the price is going to be before I decide whether to take the ride[0].<p>Uber has consistently refused to implement price quotes, to the point where they have literally jeopardized their existence in at least one city because of it: all of the legal problems they have in London would be avoided if they provided price quotes in advance.<p>Uber has been really clever to frame the controversy as a debate about whether the cabbies should have to take an exam. But the fact that medallion cabs in London have to take the street exam is all moot, because if Uber provided price quotes in advance, they would be classified as a different kind of car service which doesn&#x27;t have to take the street exam in the first place.<p>Instead, Uber would rather launch a coordinated PR and legal campaign against the entire medallion cab system in London, just to avoid implementing an incredibly user-friendly feature.<p>[0] This feature may not be in all locations yet (in fact, I don&#x27;t know if it even works if the destination is in another borough), but it&#x27;s clear to me that this is at least where Lyft is headed, whereas it&#x27;s clear that Uber is committed to <i>not</i> providing price quotes.",1430925934

Having one engine out would cause uneven thrust which will cause the vehicle to rotate or tumble. The test continued successfully, so if an engine did indeed die, we can assume that another was also intentionally shutdown to balance the thrust. The remaining engines would have fired for a little longer to make up for the lost ones.<p>The engine chambers are the first entirely 3d printed production rocket motors in the world. They&#x27;re printed in inconel using Direct Metal Laser Sintering. This is the first time that so many of them have been fired in an actual mission scenario. The tech is so new and untested that special shields were built round the motors to isolate the rest of the vehicle in case of an explosion. I&#x27;m very interested to see how they held up.<p>There was some pretty severe tumbling during the drogue and main chute deploys. While easily survivable, this would have been quite uncomfortable for any passengers inside.

They couldn&#x27;t vote, but voting isn&#x27;t a right.<p>I think that most people today -- and most of the founders that you seem to deify as paragons of philosophic virtue -- would recognize both the right to participate in the government to which one is subject (the basis for the slogan, &quot;no taxation without representation&quot;) and the right to equal treatment under the law -- both of which women did <i>not</i> have in 1788 -- to be moral rights. Certainly, both are actually legal rights which are extended to women in the US now that were not, in the same way, extended to them in 1788.<p>> They could own property, for example.<p><i>Unmarried</i> women could own property, but under the common law doctrine of coverture, <i>married</i> women could neither own property, nor enter into contracts, nor earn a salary. Her husband could do all those things -- acting on his sole discretion -- including entering into contracts which called for performance by the wife, or exercising all rights relating to property which she had owned prior to the marriage.<p>> Once married, they became basically legally merged with their husband, but I&#x27;m not sure what it would mean to share a household in 1788 and not have joint ownership of things.<p>They didn&#x27;t have joint ownership of things -- the concept of joint ownership in marriage in the US is a result of laws beginning in the 19th century which allowed a married women to own property at all. Prior to that, the husband owned any property and could dispose of it at will without the consent of the wife, but the reverse was not true. It was sole ownership by the husband, not joint ownership by the couple. The same was true of the power of contract, and basically all other beneficial aspects of legal personhood.<p>>  In fact, they would have been covered by all of the bill of rights, including 9 and 10, which we are not covered by today<p>Both halves of this are wrong: while the Ninth and Tenth Amendments remain in effect today, they were formally proposed by the first Congress operating under the new Constitution in 1789 and were ratified in 1791, so they didn&#x27;t apply to women <i>or anyone else</i> in 1788.<p>In any case, the Bill of Rights is not the only part of the Constitution that provides rights; among the amendments ratified after 1791 that provide rights are amendments 13, 14, 15, 19, 23, 24, and 26.",1430924629

One can argue that the extra &quot;a&quot; in the spelling of <i>Jamaal</i> as opposed to the more common transliteration <i>Jamal</i> is a marker but I don&#x27;t think regular people notice this.<p>Note that the other weirdness is that the common US usage of &quot;black&quot; to commonly refer to African-Americans is very problematic: An arab may look dark skinned but most would never consider themselves &quot;African&quot; or there are African-Americans that have lighter skin colors than, say, people from Sri Lanka. Similarly for the label &quot;white&quot;.

There were a couple catches, though: in the game, your bus could not go over 45 miles per hour. Also, it veered to the right, just ever so slightly, so you could not simply tape down the accelerator button on your Genesis pad and leave the game alone; you had to man the wheel at all times. Oh, and did we mention the trip takes eight hours, in real time?&quot;<p>“You saw nothing. It was just desert stuff going by, And there was a little green tree hanging from the rear-view mirror, one of those things that makes your car smell better? And it would just kind of drift in slowly to one corner of the screen. And you couldn’t take your hands off the controller, and if you did…it didn’t have a spectacular crash, it just slowly went into the sand, and then overheated and stopped, and then the game was you being towed backwards all the way back to Tucson.”<p>“And when you went from Tucson to Vegas and did the full 8 hours, you had bus stops, and the bus stops…you could stop and open the door, but no one got on. No one’s ever waiting for you. And if you went by them you weren’t punished at all, because nobody was there. It meant nothing. And a bug hit your windshield five times during the eight hours, and that was the only animation. It was just road after road after road. Eight hours of desert bus. And then when you got in - and I love this - when you got into Vegas and pulled in and stopped, the counter - which was five zeros - went to 1. You got 1 point for an eight hour shift, and then a guy came in and said, ‘Do you want to pull a double shift, Mac?’ And then you could drive back to Tucson for another eight hours for another point.”",1430924493

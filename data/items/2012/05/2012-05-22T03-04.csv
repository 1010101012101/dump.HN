What you describe largely sound like symptoms of eye strain, probably combined with lack of proper exercise and nutrition.

It is a direct insult to their intelligence and/or their ability for no good reason. That attitude does nothing to help our community, especially the people who are new to all this.<p>Let's imagine a company creates some form of hardware widget that requires some form of setup before it can be used. Initially the setup involves four steps that the company feels is ""simple"". Now, let's say a number of their customers have trouble with those simple instructions for different reasons. What's the proper response from that company?<p>A: Maybe we should think over the instructions to identify some problem spots as to why people are having trouble? Maybe we should ask some of these people what part are they having trouble with? Maybe we should consider a more in-depth explanation to people who have never used a similar device before?<p>B: If people aren't smart enough to figure out our simple instructions then they're too stupid to use our product. We could just ignore them but instead we'll insult them because they just don't get it. After all, if they're in our industry then they should already know how to do this.<p>I'm not saying that everyone should use response A, since most likely the problem has been answered somewhere. But too many people go with response B with absolutely no benefit to anyone in any way.",1337659056
4006203,comment,4005224,4006071,1,0,Periodic,,,"I used to do something similar.  Luckily, I had a cube at the end that faced a wall.  After I started feeling some wrist pains I set up a keyboard-timer, a program that was part of Gnome that locked the screen after a given interval of continuous activity.  I set it to 2 minutes every 30 minutes that didn't include at least a 1 minute break from typing.  During my 2 minute break I had enough time to do a set of push-ups and a set of sit-ups and would alternately go refill my water and go to the restroom. I think it ended up being akin to the Pomodoro technique because I found myself working harder and really getting into the zone to beat the timer.<p>I also had a period where I bought a new car and started driving to work.  I put on about 15 pounds over two months.  I realized this and went back to biking to and from work.  For me, bicycle commuting is the best way to get exercise because it doesn't feel like wasted time when I would just be sitting in traffic anyway.  It can be a bit of a hassle, but I get to comfort myself with monetary savings and benefiting the environment.",1337659045

My frontend co-workers need to constantly have that browser window open and complain about their F5 key wearing thin, while I'm lucky if I manage to remember what local domain name I assigned to Apache that points to the project I've been working on for the past 8 hours.

Id like to make clear that public availability is the absolute top-priority for us over here but we chose to make a couple of choices that other Public Cloud PaaS companies did not. These choices enable us to offer the truly best-of-breed hosting opportunity for Node.js developers:<p>1. Early on we recognized that we would not exist as a company if the node.js community was not successful. That is why we have built and maintain over 200 open-source modules on npm.
2. Infrastructure agnostic (thats right, you get to choose where your servers live).
3. Multiple platforms (currently Ubuntu and SmartOS).
4. 100% node.js up and down the stack. This is all we do and I think we do it better than anyone else. We also have provisioning, monitoring, and configuration management tools similar to our jitsu CLI for enterprises.
5. Commitment to immediate support: If you have a problem, you have a problem <i></i>now<i></i>, not tomorrow, not 3-days from now. As such, we want to make sure we grew our support team to support increased on-boarding and support requests resulting from public availability.
6. Private cloud support: this is currently where most of our customers reside. We license them software that they run in their datacenter or self-managed IaaS account.<p>So rest assured we ramping up for a public release. Feel free to email me at charlie [at] nodejitsu [d0t] com if youd like to talk more.",1337656395

One example, related to eugenics, is the study of intelligence. A survey of scientific experts in the field[1] found that a far greater proportion of them supported the 'hereditarian hypothesis' of intelligence being partly heritable, than the media let on; the views the press described as 'beyond the pale' among scientists were actually common, if not orthodox, among the actual scientists, even on the most controversial of questions.<p>The real story is that these scientists don't publicize their findings lest their field falls into disrepute and their funding gets pulled.

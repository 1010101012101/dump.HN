9551895,comment,9549930,9551092,0,0,Steuard,,,"So, do I understand you correctly: relative to the &quot;static observer&quot;, the rods are both moving &quot;sideways&quot;, as if the x-axis of a graph were moving toward +y and the y-axis were moving toward +x?<p>In that case, the &quot;static observer&quot; would see the point of contact moving at very nearly sqrt(2) times the speed of light (along the x-y diagonal). But that&#x27;s okay, because no physical object (or bit of information) is being carried along at that intersection point. (If you put some little spindle at the intersection to be carried along, you&#x27;d suddenly have Problems.)<p>On the other hand, from the reference frame of one moving bar, the intersection point appears to be moving almost infinitely fast! If the &quot;static observer&quot; measured speeds u and v for the two rods (as fractions of light speed, so u and v are both close to 1), then an observer moving with one rod will see the intersection point move at speed v/sqrt(1-u^2). If we write u = 1 - ε for some very small ε, then the intersection point&#x27;s speed in this frame is roughly v/sqrt(2ε). (The intuitive <i>reason</i> for this result is interesting: an observer on one moving rod will consider the other rod to be almost parallel, at a very small angle (rather than perpendicular), and still rushing toward her at nearly the speed of light.)",1431709000

9551891,comment,9543889,9543889,0,0,laurieg,,,"Some advice from someone who thought languages were impossible in school and then learnt a second language in adulthood:<p>Input is much better than output.  Reading and listening actually give you new words, new phrases, new connections and new ways of saying things. Speaking and writing only reinforces the things you already know.  If you have never heard the word &quot;spatula&quot; once you won&#x27;t be able to say it.<p>Also, in a real conversation you only have to be able to say something one way: &quot;Where is the station?&quot; or &quot;How do I get to the station?&quot; are just as good, but you have to understand many different possible answers.<p>When you are looking for learning materials try to only use things aimed at native speakers.  Lots of resources for adults over-simplify to fit their pedagogical idea, whereas even books for very young will children give you a full range of grammatical forms and vocabulary.<p>Never learn vocabulary as single words. Doing a flashcard that says &quot;dog&quot;==&quot;hund&quot; is just not that useful.  Instead, make flashcards of sentences, fragments and phrases.  This way you learn which verbs combine together with which nouns and all the unwritten rules.<p>Don&#x27;t just blast through x000 flashcards.  You will get bored and quit.  As you have noticed already, just dumbly repeating words takes a lot of effort to get them to stick.  When you are having fun with the language (whether that is watching TV, reading books, playing games or speaking to people) words tend to stick much better.  That said, you should still use spaced repetition for these words you find &quot;in the wild&quot;.<p>Be realistic with the amount of time you put in.  If you compare yourself to a native speaker you&#x27;re comparing yourself to someone who has had 24/7 practice in the language for many many years.<p>Don&#x27;t get tricked by the vague word &#x27;fluency&#x27;.  A 6 year old can hold a conversation and knows a great deal of words.  He is also easily confused by simple words like &quot;tax&quot; and has very little spelling ability.",1431708923

It may also be entirely dependent on them for survival.  That has an important--and possibly even necessary--psychological benefit.<p>If you&#x27;re single, and don&#x27;t have a pet, I certainly don&#x27;t begrudge you the expense in acquiring one.  It is certainly cheaper than dates or typical group entertainment activities with your friends.<p>And if I may pat nerd culture on the back for a moment, tabletop board games, role playing games, and certain card games are very often cheaper than bowling, professional sports tickets, dance clubs, movies, concerts, amusement parks, or even pay-per-view television events.<p>But I&#x27;m still not going to fault anyone for attending a pro baseball game for $30 per attendee for nosebleed seats, rather than play a tabletop RPG at $5 for some PDF downloads, paper, and a communal bag of pretzels.  In the same way, I don&#x27;t fault anyone for living in a tiny studio apartment rather than in a van down by the river.<p>The theoretical possibility that I could survive entirely on dandelions and fresh roadkill does not establish the lower bound for anyone&#x27;s standard of living.  <i>Everyone</i> at that income level has <i>already</i> made more economic substitutions than most people realize.  And in a lot of cases, novel substitutions are criminalized or otherwise prohibited by people for whom such substitutions are violations of social norms.<p>For instance, if you substitute a grass lawn for food-bearing plants in your front yard, some HOA busybody may fine you for it, then convince the cops to force you to destroy it and replant grass seed.  And good luck trying to raise rabbits or chickens in your back yard.  Or maybe you don&#x27;t even have a yard in which to make the attempt, and your landlord won&#x27;t allow windowboxes.<p>So that &quot;social norm&quot; sword swings both ways.  If you find the unaesthetic economic substitutions made by povs to be unacceptable, you cannot reasonably also complain about the expenses incurred in not making those substitutions.  I see owning pets as a substitution for more expensive human relationships, and smoking as a substitution for having any sort of hope for a better life in the future or having pride in a lasting accomplishment.  If those things were less costly and more widely available, the inferior substitute goods would be less prevalent.",1431708497

And you could modify a client to never send either, but if you are already modifying the client code you could also modify it to always use a separate connection.<p>> HTTP/2 over cleartext TCP is also possible?<p>In theory yes, in practice most will only implement it over TLS, to avoid middleboxes breaking it.

From the draft: &quot;Clients MUST NOT use alternative services with a host that is different than the origin&#x27;s without strong server authentication; this mitigates the attack described in Section 9.2.  One way to achieve this is for the alternative to use TLS with a certificate that is valid for that origin.&quot;<p>And with current TLS, the hostname is sent on the handshake (SNI), so it can&#x27;t use the same session for different hostnames.",1431707911

Any idea what daycare costs over there, typically?  Though at 500k for housing, you have the option of one spouse scaling back on work, and if not, the lower mortgage cushions the extra cost of childcare.<p>This is an aside, but when silicon valley companies say there is a desperate shortage of software engineers, Obama[1] nods gravely in agreement.  Why doesn&#x27;t he at least <i>ask</i> why they don&#x27;t let people work from places like Fairfax?  I understand that there are benefits to being in the valley, but if the shortage is <i>that</i> desperate, wouldn&#x27;t they at least try?<p>As for the original point, even if things get easier outside SF, I&#x27;d still say that you&#x27;d need to be taking some pretty serious shopping trips for kids clothes to approach the chunk of the budget that goes to health care, housing, and child care/education, even in a less brutal housing market like Fairfax.  As for good public schools, well of course that&#x27;s a relief once they get out of day care age, but you still shell out - I have two kids in public school, and just paying for the local YMCA run after care (so my wife or I can pick them up after work) is $6k per kid per year (so $12k total for me).

As you guys may be familiar, there is a class action lawsuit against Uber and Lyft from service providers that say they were not independent contractors but they were employees. Talking to a relative who used to work at the IRS and specialized in these types of disputes has pointed out some of the key things that many business get wrong.<p>1. &quot;Who is paying the service provider&quot;. If you collect the payment from the customer and the service provider gets paid by you then you could be in trouble. As far as I can tell, almost all of popular merchant accounts people are using seem to charge the customer, take their transaction fee, then &quot;transfer&quot; the money to the service provider. In that scenario, who paid the service provider? It feels like the business did, not the customer. The only one that I see which might work is the Paypal Adaptive Payment system as they let you direct the payment directly to the service provider and then the service provider pays the transaction fee.<p>2. &quot;Are you telling them how to do the work&quot;. I know that Uber and Lyft both have rules that the drivers need (are recommended) to follow. Telling the Uber black car service to provide a water bottle etc… could be a problem. I don&#x27;t think DoorDash does this but what if they wanted to their drivers to wear a DoorDash t-shirt, would that be a problem?<p>There are other factors that are considered but it seems like these two are the biggest.<p>More info on the laws: http://www.taxes.ca.gov/iCorE.bus.shtml<p>It is my opinion that the current laws need to adapt so that this entire new genre of business can operate legally.

A single gunshot will kill someone, but not instantly, and in the time it takes for that wound to incapacitate them, they might go on to kill someone else.<p>Which when you think about it is the worst of both worlds: the police kill someone, <i>and</i> that person still manages to kill someone else.<p><i>A little later.</i><p>I was curious enough about this to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just making this up (power of false memories and all that). Some arguments against &quot;shooting to wound&quot;:<p>* It supposedly takes ~250ms to fire a round under optimal conditions, and just ~150ms to rotate/translate a limb from one side of the body to another; the target moves faster than the officer can shoot.<p>* Increased likelihood of missing the target also implies an increased likelihood of hitting something that isn&#x27;t a target (again: something I would agree militates for officers not shooting <i>at all</i>, but still).<p>* The places on limbs where you&#x27;re most likely to hit a target are going to cause them to bleed out anyways --- just not in a fashion that immediately incapacitates them. The bulk of the mass of an arm or leg is also where you&#x27;re most likely to hit a huge artery.<p>* You shoot the legs of an armed attacker and you&#x27;ve left their arms and hands functional. Which means that the option (which doesn&#x27;t really exist but stipulate that it does) to fire at the legs is situational; maybe it&#x27;s something you could do with an attacker some distance away from the victim and carrying a hammer, but it would be totally ineffective against a target with a gun. You want rules that work in all situations.<p>* Assuming optimal conditions in a police shooting incident is silly, because everyone involved in that situation is completely and unavoidably overloaded with adrenaline. Police <i>are going to</i> fire multiple times, even if the guidelines say otherwise. They are going to turn in their worst firearm performances, not their range performances, because they&#x27;re impaired. Stipulating that, you want them picking the part of the target where they&#x27;re most likely to hit what they&#x27;re aiming at.<p>There are other less credible arguments against &quot;shoot to wound&quot;. For instance: police are equipped with rounds designed to penetrate but then mostly be stopped by the mass of someone&#x27;s chest and surrounding clothing, and those rounds won&#x27;t be adequately impeded by an arm or a leg. Ok, so change the ammunition.",1431705766

5424109,comment,5423455,5424039,4,0,mindcrime,,,"<i>So you thought it is loable to not exploit your opponents weaknesses?</i><p>There's a big difference between exploiting a weakness in general, and taking advantage of an extraordinary circumstance that harms your competitor.  To me, this comes down to sportsmanship.<p>To use a bit of an analogy... I wrestled in high-school.  We trained to identify weaknesses in the game of our opponents, so I might well enter into a match with a guy thinking ""I know he's susceptible to upper body takedowns like a lateral drop or an armspin, so I'm going to pointedly attack that way"".  That's trying to exploit a weakness, and it's totally reasonable, expected and fair.  But if I'm wrestling a guy and he slips on a wet spot on the mat and tears a groin muscle and is laying on the mat writhing in pain, should I jump on him and try to score a quick pin?  No, of course not.  Good sportsmanship dictates stand back, let the ref step in, give the guy his medical timeout, and then see what happens.  If he can't continue, then you either ""win"" via forfeit or the match is vacated completely (I forget exactly which would have happened in that case when I was in HS).<p>Same in the business world... if my competitor has a known, exploitable weakness, like a less mature infrastructure and problems with uptime, and I market and sell based on an overall better quality of service, that's one thing.  But if the competitor experiences a ""black swan"" event, should I ""jump on and go for the quick pin""?  I say ""no"", that doing that would be just as unethical as in the wrestling example.",1363971464

I know about 9 artists who have recently graduated and are doing small shows, oddjobs, or freelance design (looks hard). All of them have created an online presence and none of them have payed much (if anything) for it. Some learned to program themselves, others put stuff up with templates or on free portfolio sites. They're all quite poor. So that's a data point.<p>I do know one more established artist (prof. at USC) who recently paid for a site, but I don't think she'd have been happy with something that wasn't totally custom.<p>Another direction to go in with this is to create a marketplace like Etsy for 3D models.

Perhaps CCTV didn't reduce arrest rates. The lack of statistical significance means that the people doing the study failed to find out which it was.<p>Notice that if CCTV is super-duper effective, then it should be fairly easy to get a statistically significant result. This is well known; so the executive summary on page four is an example of weasel-wording. The authors insinuate that CCTV wasn't super-duper effective, heck, it didn't do much of anything. But they weasel out of talking about the power of the study.<p>If you don't expect CCTV to be super-duper effective, you might still be interested in whether it was a little bit effective. CCTV can be a lot cheaper than foot patrols. It might be disappointing, yet still earn its keep.<p>We return to the question of the statistical power of the study. A powerful study, that fails to get a statistically significant result, puts a tight upper bound on the usefulness of CCTV. If that is less than what CCTV cost we know to spend our money on something else. A weak study puts a slack upper bound on the usefulness of CCTV. If it fails to get a statistically significant result, then we learn that CCTV isn't super-duper effective, but since neither pro- nor anti- were claiming that, their quarrel continues as before.<p>I'm giving up, having skimmed to page 15 of the PDF, because, well you can read page 15 yourself and see why I think that it reveals the authors to be completely clueless about statistics.",1363970918

The owner was black, as were my co workers. The clientele of the club was mostly black. I was a manager, but the owner was there most nights too - making me not the senior person. The cops were there a lot waiting outside to harass people leaving. I saw an awful lot of cops fucking with people for minor things, that the same cops didn't even glance at in other parts of town [1]. Incidents like fights were met with forceful reactions by the police - full out ""lay on the ground and get cuffed"" responses to small brawls, but worse fights at the other bar, the response was ""hey break it up, go home, and don't come back tonight"". This gave me an inkling to privilege.<p>Then one night some hoodlums were causing a lot of mischief in the street out front and the cops initiated a full on riot response. Woah - tear gas, arrests everywhere, 40+ cops. Again, the last time I saw something on the same scale of disturbance on campus, it was 5 cops, a couple of arrests, and a ""disperse and go home"" on loop on the PA. During the riot response, I was standing in the entryway with my boss, the club owner. The cops came up and tried to usher me to safety and arrest my boss for loitering. It took a lot of effort on my part to find a cop who would listen to the fact that the guy wasn't loitering, he was standing on his property for sane business reasons. That was privilege right there.<p>The other thing I constantly encountered was that delivery people, job applicants and so on, always assumed I was in charge, no matter if I was sweeping or counting money, and no matter if the boss was sweeping or counting money. In well over 75% of cases, it was just assumed I was the boss. Again, privilege. (I mean seriously, I dressed like a bum, and the bos had style. It was absurd).<p>[1] All my cop behavior comparisons are based on the job i had before that working at a college bar in the same town, closer to campus, where the clientele was mostly white college kids.",1363970418

For example, a literal ""ton"" of redundant sensors would cost $2 million. Just the launch cost for Galileo (to Jupiter) would have cost $50-$100 million or so of its $1 billion cost.<p>Instead of having ""tons of fuel"", the cheaper option is to use complex orbits that take advantage of gravity boosts. This allows more weight for sensors and less for boring fuel. But it can take more time.<p>There's little need to self-destruct. It's expensive to carry a bomb out to Jupiter. Instead, we 'deorbited' Galileo into the planet when its mission was over.<p>The spacecraft isn't the only cost. There's also time on the Deep Space Network to be able to send and receive messages with the craft, and people to maintain things and analyze the data.<p>You could make it cheaper on the ground by using a higher power communication system. However, that makes the craft heavier, which costs more money, and reduces what else the craft can do. Rather than having enough power to transmit flyby data live, it's better to use a lower power system and send the data over several weeks. After all, in most of space there's a whole lot of nothing going on.<p>There is no drag in space. Shape doesn't make a difference.<p>You can see now some of why mission planning can be very complicated. More fuel means fewer sensors and less transmission capability, but can make a shorter trip or give more maneuverability at the end. These can all affect the mission goals.",1363970221

Many iOS users are now, for the first time, trying out Android as a result of affordable yet high quality devices being available (Nexus 4 and 7, especially).<p>2. Other platforms, especially Android, are introducing new features that iOS does not have and Apple may not wish to copy. For example: Android recently introduced lockscreen widgets, something I personally find to be completely over the top. Meanwhile, Samsung are trying out all kinds of wacky ideas (as seen with the S4 release). Compared to these, iOS does seem a little plain and boring - though personally I'm glad.<p>Up until 3-4 months ago, I was an Android user and had been for many years.

Two quick questions:<p>- Are there any South ""Good practices"" books which you would recommend? South's documentation is great, but it might be interesting to look at some real-world project examples to learn a few new tricks.<p>- I'm interested in particular in data migration development practices. How do other developers go about developing and testing them? I've discovered that by raising an Exception during the data migration, South will rollback the specific migration, allowing me to iteratively test/debug the migration until it seems bug-free and ready. Are there any other ways to do it (would running the data migration with the ""fake"" option allow me full read access to the database, but would rollback / skip any writes?).<p>Thank you for your time!",1363968210

5423777,comment,5422890,5423659,5,0,Daiz,,,"The problem I have is that I can't really imagine the catalog subscription model to be feasible if any and all catalog entries were available to download without DRM. Someone with a fat pipe could just spend a month downloading absolutely everything, cutting the subscription and enjoying the goods for a long time to come, whereas the idea is that the user remains as a subscriber because of the limited time they have for consuming all the content.<p>And while DRM is generally very inconvenient, there are also places where it's mostly ""invisible"" - Spotify and Netflix are pretty damn convenient on the whole, with pretty much the only major downside being the inability to watch stuff without an internet connection (though Spotify offers limited offline downloads for this reason too). The DRM in Steam is also generally quite invisible to the end-users, which is why people generally do not mind it - and also because Steam offers a lot more convenience with its service than what it takes away with its DRM.<p>As I said, ideally I'd like to see digital stores that combine the catalog subscription model as well as individual DRM-free purchases. Think Netflix, except you could also buy the really good stuff that you like. This would allow you to download DRM-free copies in many formats whenever you want, they could also bundle purchases with stuff like extras, and best of all: since they have a streaming infrastructure in place already they could also offer unlimited streaming for bought titles, even if you don't have a subscription. I imagine it would make for quite the killer service. But if everything could be downloaded DRM-free with just the catalog subscription, the individual sales would not work, and subscriptions would probably have a terrible retention rate.<p>Again, I just can't see the catalog subscription model working without at least some sort of ""download prevention"". I guess the biggest question is: Can we achieve that without the need for heavyweight black-box DRM schemes? I mean, you'd really just need to stop ""casual"" downloading - pirates will always find a way around protections, so they can't be stopped, but you'd just have to make sure a regular customer sees value in both the catalog subscription (which would be essentially renting) and individual title purchasing (actual buying).",1363968179

They didn't want to fire me anyway, just to freeze my salary.<p>My point (same as in the article) is that performance is not the question, but market forces. It turns out they really lacked the power to give me a bad review. The same person that ordered the good review to be burnt and wrote a new one (very bad, I guess) was a few days later offering me 10% more pay, just because I was leaving.",1224577824

That's your response?<p>moon's complaint is that now, there are some awkward positions to deal with at Powerset/MS. Because we were all a very tight knit startup before being acquired, many of us are friends with our supervisors and bosses. Now, we're suddenly faced with the question, ""Why did my friend and boss value me at value X and Tom at value Y?"" These are guys and gals we've basically lived with for 2-3 years, working feverishly for the shared goal of a game-changing increment to what constitutes search. Everyone played a part, but sometimes it can be painful learning that people may not have regarded your part as much as you did.<p>What's more, every Powersetter knows some people in the company got The Shaft in terms of retention, for a variety of political and legal reasons. Some of these people chose to stay, some chose to leave. For those who chose to stay, this rubs salt in a wound that's still sore: their baby grew up and didn't treat them as well as the other parents.<p>Being acquired is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it's great because you get a payout. On the other hand, the company becomes something else entirely and it's almost never what you had before the acquisition.<p>I understand why Tom talked about it (and it is an interesting story), but I understand why moon is upset about it as well. Tom was very fortunate that he had something else to walk away to (and this definitely drove up his retention price). For many Powersetters, it was ""Microsoft"" or ""...?"" (this is doubly true for the scientists who were literally redefining the field as they went along). I only wish everyone had as difficult-yet-easy choice as Tom did.",1224577120

I'm also pretty disappointed in the lack of professional behavior--no CI, few/no automated tests, and few/no code reviews have led to some serious WTFs that sneak in that are really unsettling. There's a lack of project leadership, too, in that if you'd like to contribute there are no real designated maintainers or developers with responsibility over submodules (I've tried myself, multiple times, to no real success).<p>I think the best way forward for Mono and games would be a library, starting with MonoGame or not, that followed better practices and didn't try to make square pegs fit in round holes. There are a lot of areas where it makes sense for Mono to ape the .NET APIs but this doesn't seem like one of them.",1350939594

Just launched one giant web project for my day job and am constantly working on a variety of side projects.<p>Some tips: What are you spending your time on?  TV?  Lawn work?  Date nights?  Going out?  Commuting?<p>Outsource the lawn work.  Quit watching TV.  If you have shows you watch with your significant other, then take a laptop in and work casually while you're watching.  If you have more than a few shows a week, then you might need to consider cutting back.<p>If you have a long commute, stop it.  Either move or find a different job.  Another popular suggestion is to take mass transit and work on the way, but in my opinion that time is too interruptable (YMMV) - between other passengers, having to stand up for the elderly, change stations, make sure that you don't miss your stop, etc., my tack was to eliminate the commute altogether.<p>Ultimately it's your life obviously, and only you can say what can and can't be cut out, but if you honestly can't cut out anything to make more time for your dreams, then perhaps they're just hobbies?  That isn't meant to be a critique, but if you can recognize that you have a programming hobby, it might turn out to be more enjoyable than always fretting about how to find time for them.<p>Of course I wish there was more time in the day, and I'm sure I don't get as much done as somebody with less family obligations, but I still get plenty of things done.  While I've certainly been in the same boat you're in, what I ultimately realized was that my problem wasn't time, but about making effective use of it, and committing to a single idea to completion.<p>I've started a million projects that will probably remain unfinished, all the while lamenting that I didn't have enough time to get them all done.  When I found my first spurt of productivity was in realizing that nobody has enough time to do everything they want, and that in trying, I wasn't effective at getting ANYthing I wanted.  After that, I found that by rigidly focusing on one project at a time made me get a lot more done.  When I hit stumbling blocks, I can take a break and think about them, so that the next time I sit down to code, I have a clearer picture of what the problem was, what the solution is, and how I'm going to use my time effectively.<p>If I run into a problem after I just started out coding, I start doing something easy, but productive.  This past weekend, while watching football on Sunday (poor Ravens), I was able to implement asset bundling for my JS, CSS, write some fabric deploy scripts, optimize my PNGs and convert them to Sprites.<p>Anyway, like I said, I've had instances where I genuinely didn't have enough time, but I was able to reprioritize my life to get more time.  I've had times where I just <i>thought</i> I didn't have enough time, but I was able to refocus to solve that problem.  Side projects are a funny thing, because nobody's expecting you to get them done, and it's not paying your bills.  If you need, get a project manager, or get your wife, or a friend, or somebody to hold you accountable to a deadline.  Pick a date and give status reports, on ONE project.  If things slip, they should be disappointed, and make you feel bad.  Make yourself accountable, even if it's to somebody else.  All of the above worked for me until I was able to be a more focused self-starter when money wasn't (directly) involved.<p>Good luck either way.",1350937971

that the typical offer to various records-keepers from the LDS family
history folks was: ""We'll pay to microfilm your records, you get a copy
to keep, and the LDS gets a copy to use.""  Win-win.<p>The transcription of records for indexing is also valuable, but less so,
given that volunteers were working from projected microfilm copies of
(usually) hand-written records (some in beautiful but dated hands).<p>OCR in the 1980s was not adequate, but Soundex indexing helps a lot,
and if you need to search a small area exhaustively, you can see
many of the microfilm copies of records through a site like
ancestry.com or from the digital media available for use at 
local LDS family history centers.<p>The LDS was also strong in producing the GEDCOM data standard,
which is widely (almost universally) used for family tree exchanges,
and the PAF software package (which now has many competitors.)<p>Note that research into ancestry has an interesting network effect - 
while people have 2^N N-parents, once N gets over 4 or 5 it can
become challenging to trace individuals - but the chances that some
other active researcher shares some of those 2^N N-parents start to
increase - and ancestry.com has done well at providing links
to other researcher's public trees when they become available.<p>This pattern has the effect of encouraging subscribers who have 
already found most of their ancestors out to level N, for whatever N,
to continue to subscribe in hopes of finding a new link from another
researcher, or perhaps a new clue in a newly digitized document set.<p>It will be interesting to see how the decreasing cost of genome
analysis affects family history research - perhaps helping find
distant cousins, or perhaps revealing surprising differences between
a presumed history and the biological record.",1350936153

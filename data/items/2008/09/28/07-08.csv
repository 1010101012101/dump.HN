It is all still here.  While credit will be hard to get, it was similiarly hard to get in the past.  Other countries are not in a perfect position to take the ""superpower"" status away from the United States.  China is too closed (currency, politics, etc), Russia is turning back to communism, France can't keep there own people happy, Iran might start an arms race, the EuroZone has there own problems, etc.  Considering everyone else, the US for the most part is pretty stable.",1222588627

Would I want to work for someone who refused to take a stand on whether I could visit my partner in the hospital?<p>Second, although AIDS orphans are tragic, a general ""we support AIDS orphans"" blog post would be considered rhetorical and would not get garner much additional support for AIDS orphans. However, voting is coming soon and Google's position on this will change votes in CA.<p>Third, yes <i>theoretically</i> I suppose that Google is ""spending an enormous amount of Google brand and influence"" ... but practically, they're spending ten minutes of Sergey's time to write a blog post.<p>Google is not going to lose business -- you can't use the Internet without seeing their ads. I also doubt that its brand name will be tarnished much -- some people may despise the move, but a lot of others will like Google even more (including myself). Many companies already provide full benefits to same-sex couples -- isn't this already publicly affirming them?",1222588381

317496,comment,317155,317155,0,0,bdr,,,"For all of you who are worried about your stock price: don't forget to consider what effect this has on Google's culture. From a business perspective, if you look only at the external effects, taking this stand probably does weigh out to a bad idea. But the internal benefits of employee loyalty and a culture of tolerance might outweigh that, making the blog post justified even from your strictly financial perspective.",1222588179

317490,comment,317155,317380,0,0,gscott,,,"A search engine who claims to be neutral yet have social-political bias is never a good thing.  The word from the top filters throughout the whole organization, if you don't want to loose your job you have to believe what they believe.  Therefore if you are working on search, you are going to be biased towards your your company policies (beliefs), wanting to please your superiors, and keeping your job.",1222586429

And, it would help you to talk with them when you don't want money from them.)<p>Heck - you could ask these VCs what they want.  If they ask for something that you don't have, you can ask how producing it moves your biz forward.<p>It's generally accepted that you shouldn't build technology that won't be needed when it's ready, so why would biz artifacts be any different?<p>All that said, does your current biz plan satisfy your needs?  If it doesn't, how much is that costing you?",1222586367
317488,comment,309432,309752,0,0,davidsrose,,,"If a VC cares only about the problem and solution, what does that say about how much they want to invest in YOU? Not much. Most early stage investors (like me) have no choice but to 'bet the jockey, not the horse', because we are betting on YOU to take something that barely exists and go to the ends of the earth to make something of it.<p>In a later stage deal, such as a private equity acquisition, we're investing in the existing company: its cash flow, operations, customers, etc. The CEO is less important, because we can get rid of him/her if necessary and put someone else in. Is that the way you'd like us to think of YOUR deal?",1222586306

317486,comment,309432,309834,0,0,davidsrose,,,"My [very strong] advice is not to do a live demo DURING YOUR POWERPOINT PITCH. You'll absolutely need to do a demo at a later point (perhaps even immediately following your pitch presentation), but what we're talking about here is a very specific piece of performance art: a carefully-tuned, 15-20 minute presentation which is usually presented in front of a group (either a formal group of angels, or a smaller group of VCs). For this presentation, you want as much control as possible, where NOTHING can go wrong.<p>You can deliver 200% of the value of a live demo in a CANNED demo (or screen shots of a demo). There is no time spent moving between screens, no chance that a bad connection or temporary glitch will make you look like an idiot, no chance that Murphy's Law will rear its ugly head.<p>Think of this as one of the [very important] communications pieces in your arsenal. You'll also need an elevator pitch (60 seconds, max, no slides), a business plan (so you know what your business is all about), an executive summary (which is what the investor usually reads), handouts to leave behind after your presentation (these are NOT your slides!), and, increasingly these days, a short (5 minute) video, which can be uploaded to the angel's or investor's web site if you're asked to submit your materials that way.",1222586048

317482,comment,317316,317394,0,0,jhancock,,,"My point is that the trademark registration process is VERY simple.  There is not much you can do to commit fraud.  You fill out a simple form and submit your name and supporting material such as logo to a search.  If the search, based on the category of goods and service you select, is deemed not in conflict with already registered product or services, you get the nod and you are registered.<p>The whole point of the registration process is you are paying the USPTO a fee to do a search to avoid conflict.  Yes, there is an assumption that you are not applying for something you know already is registered by someone else.  But the point of the search is a safeguard for this.<p>I am very interested to understand the details of the fraud aspect of this claim.  I am also interested to see how the USPTO's paid search process didn't catch the conflict.",1222585600
317481,comment,317057,317097,0,0,anamax,,,"> How many companies got shit term sheets because Perkins had to finance a boat that can never be fully enjoyed?<p>Probably none - VCs invest very little of their own money.<p>More to the point, who cares it can be ""fully enjoyed""?  Not to put too fine a point on it, but I don't get any benefit from how much someone else enjoys something.<p>I do, however benefit from the development and practice of amazing technology.  Heck, I benefit from folks who do honest work on something that someone else values enough to pay for with their own money.",1222585461

3463,comment,3419,3427,0,0,jwecker,,,"I agree.  In addition, some interesting notes about HCI.  First- if you haven't studied HCI or know what the acronym stands for, you may make it as a programmer for some company, but you're not going to reach your full potential creating new things.<p>Anyway, I was reading an HCI paper in one of the publications a few years ago and came across these interesting statistics:<p>75% of software does _not_ in fact increase the productivity of the end-user. (over a paper-based alternative)<p>Doing a single user-testing session results on average of fixes that take less than 2 days and that increase the usefulness of the product by 80% (that is it increases the end-user's productivity that much).<p>Here's a poor-man's usability test.  Get a bunch of people who have never seen your product and don't know much about it, but that are in your target demographic (shouldn't be difficult- a brother, roommate, family of the employees, someone off the street).  Sit them down in front of your product and tell them you're not going to be allowed to answer any of their questions because you're measuring the usability of the system.  Then stand over their shoulder and let them do their thing.  Don't make a sound- no guiding, no ""oh- that actually works by doing this""- just observe and take notes.  A few sessions like this will mean a world of difference in your UI.",1173559879

3460,comment,3441,3454,0,0,drop19,,,"I like your suggestions about the strengths and weaknesses and dream section. I'm going to go change that right now.  My original thought was, I want to really focus on the kinds of motivated technical people reading YCombinator, but you're right, it sounds too much like an employee search.  <p>It also makes sence because people might be looking for skills that are not always technical (or maybe for people who do not self-identify as having technical skills).<p>As for the name, that is a big relief to hear you say that.  My girlfriend thought it wasn't very 'cool-sounding' (i.e. not a web 2.0 name).<p>I never thought about the potential for garbage profiles.  I'm not sure if I could be successful with it by using invitations -- I don't know anyone else in this world (yet).",1173559276
3459,comment,3441,3450,0,0,drop19,,,"Thanks!  This might sound like I'm blowing smoke, but I'm not: I've been really inspired by all of the great articles here and at other sites, and by the 37signals book Getting Real.  I grew up very much cultured to think I would have to join a large organization to be successful, and now I'm starting to realize it's better to strike out on my own.",1173558946

3457,comment,3426,3426,0,0,python_kiss,,,"Any sufficiently large corporation cannot continuously hire smart people since there is a tendency to push for the average. Google has avoided this by applying something known as the ""Lake Wobegon strategy"" (http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/03/hiring-lake-wobegon-strategy.html). It states that a company should only hire candidates who are above the mean of the current flock of employees.<p>Though, as I stated earlier, even Google cannot continue to endlessly hire smart individuals. A sample of the average IQ of University students would most likely be the same as the rest of the population. There are always a few exceptional individuals in any group, but the group itself is most often average.",1173558835

3454,comment,3441,3441,0,0,jwecker,,,"Great name for the site.  A couple of suggestions:  technical strengths and weaknesses are important, but not necessarily more important than general strengths and weaknesses- at least not for a founder.  If it was an employee search that would be one thing but I would possibly relabel those ""technical & business strengths"" etc.<p>""My dream is to start a company that"" should probably be more along the lines of ""I have plans and/or interests in the following areas-""  I guess I would just step the seriousness up a little bit so you get people who are generally serious partners.<p>Finally, I'm normally against this, but this is one place where you may want to consider having the site invitation-only, either that or password-protect the site and let the password spread among founder-networked people.  A lot of garbage profiles would ruin the usefulness of the site.<p>[upd]
oh, and one more thing- maybe one more field where the potential co-founder can write about themselves- ""about me"" or ""unique things about me"" or something along those lines.  Finding a cofounder is a lot about chemistry and an alignment of personalities, not just matching up needed technical skills.  It's not a school project, it's more like a.... marriage, to be honest (nothing weird of course).",1173558705

Any competitors will be behind the curve once they realize what you already know.<p>If your idea is good in a duh-obvious sense, then you can be damned sure someone else is already doing it or has done it. The way to succeed in this aspect is by doing it better where others have been lazy.",1173557822

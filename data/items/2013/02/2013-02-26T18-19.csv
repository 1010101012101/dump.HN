5287618,comment,5286091,5286091,3,0,wbond,,,"The big changes in ST3 aren't primarily user facing. Yes, there are some useful new features, but the reason that this is ST3 versus ST2.1 is because of the API changes.<p>Sublime Text X, which became ST2, started almost 3 years ago. Back then the API used Python 2.6, I imagine largely because that was the stable 2.x branch. 3.x was still bleeding edge, and not built into OS X.<p>Over time as more developers learned about Sublime Text, the plugin community exploded. Now there were some warts from the very beginning. On Windows, Python 2.x can't import from paths that contain non-ASCII characters. To get around this, Jon had to implement some hacks to get it all to work consistently.<p>As the plugin community has grown so much, we've found lots of edge cases and run into issues with developing against an aging version of Python. At this point, Python 2.6 is EOL in 7 months. It strikes me that it is a hard, but important choice to break backwards compatibility to fix a number of core issues in ST, but also to jump to a modern version of Python.<p>Python 3.3 came out just 5 months ago. Jon has rewritten the python bindings and restructured the way packages are imported to allow for importing across plugins. Luckily it isn't that hard to write Python that runs on 2.6 and 3.3, especially with 3.3 adding back in support for u"""" strings.<p>So yes, it is going to continue to be a little while before the plugin community has finished all of the work porting plugins to ST3. There is a list of what already works at <a href=""https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/wiki/Sublime-Text-3-Compatible-Packages"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/wiki/Sublim...</a>. Also, Package Control is fully functional with ST3 now. The last remaining piece before the PC 2.0 release is taking this opportunity to fix some issues with the channel/repo/package structure of Package Control.<p>That said, this break is positioning Jon and the community to continue to build great stuff that is really useful. So yeah, it kinda sucks, but I have a strong sense users of ST will be much better off in the near future.",1361905196

Good programmers still make less money than a good doctor or lawyer, indicating that those are even shorter in supply. Surely addressing that shortage would be a higher priority? Lots of people could use more legal services if the price was lower, and yet if someone wanted to hire a Harvard lawyer for $60k a year, we wouldn't even seriously consider it, but when someone wants an MIT programmer for $60k a year we consider it a job opening and thus a 'shortage.' Thus I find the 'job openings' a ridiculous metric of supply and demand, and I would use the metric people have always used - the market price. Using this more reasonable metric, there are careers with much more severe shortages of talent. As usual, nobody is surprised that those heavily invested in hiring programmers want a larger supply to drive down market wages.",1361904976

I think she assumes the reader already knows what the problem is.<p>My take is that the more people focus on identity (""female"" ""founder"" ""hacker"" ""HNer"" whatever), the less they focus on results. Everything that happens in their lives gets viewed through this lens of identity. Unfortunately, that colors things in an unrealistic way:<p>""This guy trolled me because I am female"" vs ""this guy trolled me, and he trolls a lot of other people with penises too, because he's a dick"".<p>It leaves you ridiculously vulnerable to identity attacks:<p>""Top 10 Traits of Entrepreneurs"" ""Are you entrepreneur enough?"" ""Hacker News is a wasteland"" ""Designers Suck At X""<p>Identity-involvement not only reduces your ability to see reality (you look for the first fit explanation to any occurrence, and identity is always with you), it also means you are really easy to troll and manipulate. Either by insulting or questioning YOUR identity, or massaging it and propping it up (""I have the traits of an entrepreneur! Yay!"") (""Hackers will inherit the earth""), or attacking your lack of support for their identities (""Why doesn't your conference have 50% women?"").<p>Finally, identity-involvement leads to a narrowing of experience -- ""Do female founders do this? Can they? Will I be fulfilling a stereotype? Will I be letting people down?"" ""I'm a designer designers don't x"" ""I'm a hacker, and hackers care about the hottest technologies""<p>It becomes about grooming, enforcing, and defending an image, rather than results.<p>I see this a lot. It's a shame. I used to fall prey to it myself, wishing I wasn't a woman because of people thought ""woman"" meant -- something I had no interest in (hair, makeup, purses, women's magazines, women's meetups etc) -- and those other women ""made me look bad"".<p>But then I realized what an ego trip that was. ""Woman,"" too, is just a label, and by denying it, I was implicitly buying into its legitimacy.<p>Now I just do whatever the fuck ""Amy"" does, which is my stereotyped identity sample size 1.<p>A friend of mine was concerned that her girly clothes and love of makeup make <i>her</i> less credible as a spokesperson for women's issues. One of these seems like a concern about sexism but both hers and my worries are actually about the same issue (identity). Like me, my friend also has learned to simply embrace <i>who she is</i> and not worry that she's ""letting other women down"" by simply doing what she loves.<p>It sounds to me that this is what the author is getting at, she just doesn't lay it out that clearly. That's why she says things about women's symposiums, talking about femaleness, etc., stressing about / regretting (instead of using) the fact that you're the sole female in a thing[1], because those are identity involvements. These points of hers, I agree with.<p>To those who will say that she is saying ""act like a man"" -- she doesn't.<p>To those who will say ""this is glossing over very real sexism"" -- please see my example above about the troll. Often people assume that if something is (OR APPEARS to be) sexually related, it's sexism. They look at the first possible answer (""she's being trolled she's a woman it must be because she's a woman!""). But 9 times out of 10, the guy who insults a speaker for being a woman, insults another speaker for using JavaScript or being fat or wearing a suit, or looking like a hipster. That's not sexism, that's an equal opportunity dick, who simply seizes on the most vulnerable part of his victim's identity. Yes, identity.<p>Is there real sexism? Absolutely. But is there any proof that women's conferences and angry blog posts help?<p>Sure, it's annoying for some dude at a meetup to assume you're there with somebody else. It's also annoying for some woman on Twitter to loop me into ""sexist technology"" rants because I have breasts and therefore she expects I agree with her. But that's just life. You can't control what people think, not even of you. And the annoying people in both examples are just pattern matching, which usually works, and not making a value judgment about your person (aka sexism).<p>[1] (Aside: stressing about being ""the only x"" in an environment is often even more about identity-confirmation -- <i>I need other people Who Look/Think/Act Like Me to validate my choices are okay</i> -- as it is about exclusion. This is the same reason some people <i>love</i> being ""the only x"" -- it confirms their identity as a renegade.

Initially we just did everything the Rails way (i.e. jQuery and AJAX), but we have been looking to move stuff more MV* client side where possible.<p>I don't think either solution is really that great at the moment. Doing things MV* client side mean you duplicate views and potentially logic (we use decorators a lot which would need to be duplicated). Doing things via AJAX means you have to wait for the response before the view is updated (things like comments that will succeed - assuming validations are done before the request is made, and the server doesn't break - shouldn't have this delay).<p>One thing we have done that has helped, is instead of just attaching a load of jQuery events on random elements, is writing our Javascript in a similar style to Backbone views. Instead of writing everything with lots of nested events, we have a 'controller' responsible for each feature. On initialisation it binds to the DOM events it needs, and those call other methods on the controller. It also has it's own (local) state, so if we need to use the same feature multiple times on a page we can do with ease. It has allowed us to separate code better, and more importantly make it more legible.

Take the way Github works for example: at the end of the day their main goal is an accessible hosted interface to git, to make git version control easier and ubiquitous; nevertheless having that main goal does not stop their developers from creating new features (say for example a desktop client) that make the product better though it may or may not directly translate to their main goal.<p>If you have a company that develops software and your developers have the autonomy to work on things that they actually believe will further increase the companies value (be it an interface change, bug fixes, or the refactoring of bad code) you will most definitely have a better result than if you make people work on things that might not be their forte or that are uninteresting to them.<p>Now I don't mean that people should have a complete free reign of the product, as some things are too important to forgo because no one wants to do them, but giving developers the chance to work on things they actually believe in as opposed to things that might not translate to creating value in their minds can go a long way towards good morale and retention, and un-doublty a better product because of it.",1361903572

So, I shouldn't try to comment on all you mentioned.<p>In effect, commenting on the Republicans, what is crucial is simpler than your list -- they lost!<p>For a politically neutral response, all I wanted was good gumment.  I'm registered as a D but try to vote just for good gumment.  I like my Congressman, and he's R.<p>But as you will see below, I learned a lot from the two links from antoko.<p>At times I was shaking my head or screaming or both at some of the Rs talking about 'abortion':  Why?  Because Roe has been the law for 40 years, and no matter what anyone wants about Roe, there's zip, zilch, zero chance Roe will be changed.  So, talking about it is just to get some people up on their hind legs for nothing.<p>Then the political strategy question is, what were the R gains from the people up on their hind legs?  My guess was, negative:  The Rs had those people anyway, and talking about abortion just cost the Rs a lot of votes otherwise.  E.g., a lot of single women were scared.  Then look at the two links and see how the women voted, scared.  Maybe talking about abortion got some Rs some $ donations, but I have a tough time believing that that was an issue.  Net, I just didn't 'get it' why so many Rs talked so much about abortion.  Sure, maybe Rove helped W win an election in Texas that way, but in national politics?  Gads.<p>Places where I wanted better gumment:  Fighting two foreign wars for 10 years each.  Gumment backing junk housing paper and, thus, blowing the housing bubble that crashed, wiped out financial assets and bank reserves, much as in The Great Depression.  Our gumment did it to us.  Gumment should have seen it coming and executed a soft landing.  Supposedly both Clinton and W saw the problem but concluded that politically they couldn't do anything about it and, then, just hoped for the best.  Bummer.  What will gumment do next?  See a big flu epidemic coming and not tell anyone because gumment leaders don't want to be blamed for the sting of a flu shot needle?  I believe that we should be doing more with fission nuke power, but apparently we're not.  I just don't think we have gumment nearly as good as we should.<p>Your question of what to do about it is on target.  Of course the short answer is, have people demonstrate, have some politicians take up the positions, and have the voters vote them in.  I thought that somewhere between 2008 and 2012 we would have had a few million people on the Mall in DC screaming for better gumment, but we didn't.<p>On Obama, if take some of his positions, e.g., his SFC interview of his intention to shut down all the coal fired electric generating plants, then 49% of our electric power and 23% of all of our energy (in a DoE report), then I was outraged.  But he hasn't done it.  To me there is a pattern:  He says a lot of things; some of the things please some people, outrage some others, and get ignored by others.  Then when that issue is out of the news, he says more things.  Next to none of what he says actually leads to corresponding action.  So, net his actions have not been nearly as bad as I feared.  I still believe that he is a poor president.  Then I have to conclude:  I'm in the minority or nearly so -- he is still relatively popular.  I don't see just why, but he is.  Then this comes back to your issue of how to get better gumment:  As long as Obama is as popular as he is, I don't see much hope for big demonstrations for something better.  If nothing else really bad happens, then he will be able to have served for 8 years and leave often regarded as at least an okay president.  So, our chances for something a lot better don't look good.<p>Then for the Rs, from the noise I hear from them on how to do better next time, I don't hear much that looks like it will win elections.  Instead, the Rs are still talking to themselves about what their right wing dreams of and ignoring everyone else.  I don't think that what they are saying is really good gumment, and I think it will lose in elections.<p>For the biased MSM, I don't have a clue what they will do.<p>To me, the saving grace is our founding fathers and our Constitution and, in particular, that the Rs have the House and the Ds have the Senate so that there is 'grid lock' and not much gets through and there's <i>lots</i> of talk that doesn't mean anything.  In particular, Obama can ask Congress for anything he wants, but he will have a tough time getting back even a resolution in favor of apple pie.  So, such grid lock is not good gumment but not the worst thing that could happen.",1361903328

My view (and yes I am working up a blog post) is<p>1. Coding is the equivalent of literacy after 1451 (Gutenberg).<p>2. in say, one generation, any company not having literate people at all levels of the organisation, and not having then changed how they work at a fundamental level to take advantage of these programmers/business people will be at as severe a compettive dis-advantage; similar to trading company in 1600 where no-one at the top could read or write.<p>3. If you think that's a bit of a stretch, or say ""yeah but there were loads of illiterate people on trading ships"" - but the people at the top, the captains, the investors, could all read and write.  So they could exchange information globally and accurately.  Share a model of the market effectively.<p>4. So, the successful companies in a generation will have coding in their DNA.  And to get there from today, companies will benefit most from hiring great coders and teaching them how to be CEOs, how to be Salespeople, how to be accountants.  And letting them run the company as CEOs, and accountants do now.  Let me repeat - hire people who can code and teach them to be CEOs.  They will find ways to run the company with coding at its core.<p>5. In short programmer anarchy / autonomy is the right way forward.  The advantages of running a company through code is so great (comparable to running a company through writing) that all other skills come second.  They are necessary but software eats them.  For a generation only.<p>Takebacks:  I am <i>guessing</i> that the econmoic advantages of code-literate population is a diminishing return compared to a text-literatate population.  say 50%?

The WBUR investigation is packed full of details.<p>They don't paint a pretty picture! There is good reason to be concerned about Ortiz. There are concerns about the way she manages her office, sets up incentives for AUSAs, oversees cases, and handles transparency. The story they build is of a US Attorney appointment that is simply not working out. It's damning enough that I actually started to reconsider whether Heymann was really the root of the problem; if he'd been reporting to a different US Attorney, things might have worked out differently.<p>The most disquieting thing Ortiz says in the WBUR show is an offhand comment. ""It's an adversarial system"" she says, defending her aggressive handling of prosecutions. But while that's true at one level (prosecutors are technically & mechanically adversaries of defense attorneys), it's deeply untrue at the level she seems to mean it on. She comes off as believing that her job is to present the most aggressive possible case for conviction and let the judge & jury sort out the truth. But that's <i>not</i> the prosecutor's role in the US! Prosecutors have discretion over what cases they bring and are required to use it. It's very worrying when a US Attorney implies that it's not their job to deploy that discretion.",1361902099

You can achieve this pretty easily.  You shouldn't be refreshing the entire comments container.  If your views are well modularized, the comments container would render many _comment partials.  You would simply render a new partial and insert it into the page appropriately. There's no reason to disrupt the rest of the page.<p>When you do client-side MVC, you end up having to duplicate a lot of your model and controller logic.  This happens either explicitly, when you start defining relationships between models and how they should react to changes in associated models (e.g. backbone-relational), or implicitly, when it gets stuffed into view and ""routing"" logic (and leaving you with spaghetti code that's different but no better than jquery spaghetti).  In rails views, you have access to the real model objects and you can still use AJAX to have a ""single-page application"" without the huge added complexity.<p>There's obviously a place for client-side MVC and that is RICH APPLICATIONS.  Google Docs, Pandora, a photo editor, etc...<p>I think another factor is what your team looks like. If the person writing the models and controllers is the same guy making the front end, then you should probably stay away from client-side MVC. If you have dedicated frontend/javascript guys, then it might make more sense.",1361901621

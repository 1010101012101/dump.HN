That way the data can be stored encrypted in a centralized location and decrypted only on the client side. This is harder to do for things like email because Google needs to target ads, but for google docs this should work.",1191275556

But I'd settle for either <p>- Text description of medium length - yuk!"" <p>- Here's a picture of how to make something with text - Sort of ok<p>- Watch the video- Best<p>Since this is a tool it's probably better to create a viewable demo so you can get an idea BEFORE you start. Especially for people who are not really sure what is going on. One other thing that annoys me a tiny bit is there is no menu so I can't really navigate  anywhere so I can find out who made it, instructions, blog, etc.  <p>One other point. It might help users to have a graphic indicating where they can click to edit an object. You run your mouse over an object and the controls appear, move it away and the controls disappear. It is not immediately apparent where to move your mouse again.<p><i>A bit later...</i><p>Yep it's a pain to find the edit point. I would have liked some visual clue (outline, dotted text around the control) where it is until I accept the edit. I know the page is an ""in-edit"" page but I'd like some visual clue to controls I have edited, and bits that still need work ",1191273012

I'll be super happy when/if it does happen, but won't hold my breath until it does.<p>Consider TrackIR, a phenomenal gaming technology that has been around for years and significantly increases immersion and ""natural"" input/control yet has failed to find meaningful traction with developers outside of simulators and a few other niche titles like Arma.  Or 3D, which is still little more than a quickly-tiring gimmick despite a much wider range of titles being developed with support for it.  Or Kinect, which, after the initial rush, has proved to still mostly be a solution in search of a problem.<p>Even if VR hardware has finally reached feasibility for mass-market production and pricing, without a large developer commitment it won't take off.  It faces the same catch-22 as every add-on technology, requiring large developer time investment to support yet not having the market share to warrant such an investment, and the market share never getting large enough to warrant it because the investment is never made.  The announced ""launch titles"" for the Rift don't really indicate that this hurdle is anywhere close to being surpassed.<p>It's cool to think about these things but ""the future is now!"" is inevitably premature.  The article frames the entire thing as hypothetical to try to avoid this, but is still pretty gushing to the point of walking past these obvious and serious challenges.",1347118144

Basically it's a block device with page size about 8KB and erase block ~ 2MB. Data could be read and written only in pages, in-chip page load times are on the order of 100us, page write 1ms, block erase -- 5ms, and it takes about 100us to transfer page data in either direction. So, random read/write latencies are 10^2 / 10^1 times lower than HDD's, but still about 10^3 / 10^4 times larger than DRAM's. I guess internal architecture could be redisigned to reduce block sizes and allow parallel operations inside a sigle chip, but it's unclear how much it will affect density and price.<p>But it would be useful to put NAND controller closer to CPU, remove block device emulation layer and let OS do wear-leveling and block allocation.

(Men could come if they participated in the outreach and found a woman to sign up.)<p>We thought it would be hard to find women to attend our first workshop.  We brainstormed for weeks about how to connect to various women's groups and corporate organizations. Then after two tweets and and one email, we had a waiting list in less than 24 hours.  Over the last 3 years the pattern repeats itself, no matter where we have workshops, we consistently have waiting lists of women who want to attend.  In SF, we have workshops every month, and routinely have 60 people (mostly women) on the waitlist.<p>Women do want to write code. We usually have 20% who have never coded before, but typically 50-70% self-identify as non-programmers.

The evidence is that I don't know of anything big in a dynamic language. Not exactly great points against python when the argument boils down to, ""all dynamic languages are bad.""",1347116426

Having to include self as a method argument means that those are not methods, but static functions.<p>This declaration makes no sense.<p>> This really means there isn't precisely methods at all<p>Of course there is:<p><pre><code>    >>> class Foo(object):\n    ...     def bar(self): return 42\n    ... \n    >>> type(Foo().bar)\n    <type 'instancemethod'>\n    >>> m = Foo().bar\n    >>> m()\n    42\n</code></pre>\n> If there is a valid reason for this, it would go a long way in explaining away one of the major reasons I dislike python.<p>I don't know (and don't really care) if you'll consider it ""a valid reason"", but here's GvR's reasoning: <a href=""http://neopythonic.blogspot.be/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has-to-stay.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://neopythonic.blogspot.be/2008/10/why-explicit-self-has...</a>",1347116414

Is it really that big a deal?<p>Perhaps MIT should adopt a new motto: ""We offer free printing!!!""<p>And who cares who she dated or who she married?  What self-indulgent tripe!<p>So MIT is more open than Harvard.  Whoopdie fucking doo.<p>At lots of less ""exclusive"" universities access is really not an issue.  They have open doors to their libraries, their buildings, and their classrooms to anyone who wants to drop by.  There's no ID check except to check out library books or register for courses.<p>Is this really the best that can be said about MIT?",1347116401

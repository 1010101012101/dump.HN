Every time, I wanted to buy stock but didn&#x27;t know how or didn&#x27;t have money, and, in fact, in one case I did buy some Apple when they introduced the Nano.<p>Every single time I was correct, and would have made somewhere between 40-200% profit. I only got the 40% profit out of Apple (because I sold too early), but generally, I seem to have a pretty good eye for this.<p>The big thing though is: I&#x27;m patient. I don&#x27;t need to invest all the time. I only get this kind of insight every few years, but this kind of profit every few years is still pretty good. Next time I get this kind of insight about something, I&#x27;m going in big.",1386064792

6839408,comment,6835521,6836011,2,0,__david__,,,"> When you say you know people who can&#x27;t handle a 30&quot; monitor, do you mean that? They would refuse to use a 30&quot; even if they were given one? I&#x27;ve only met a few people who are of that particular disposition, and I personally consider them odd. It&#x27;s a weird self-flagellation or quasi-Luddism.<p>The last computer monitor I bought was the original 24&quot; Apple Cinema Display. I haven&#x27;t used it for day to day computing in 7 years or so. The reason for that is because I bought a laptop. For the first year or so I plugged the laptop into the display but as I bought newer and newer laptops the difference in resolution got smaller. My current laptop&#x27;s high DPI screen has almost quadruple the number of pixels as that display.<p>So, there are 2 reasons that I&#x27;ve not bought a large display.<p>1) I don&#x27;t want to <i>need</i> it. If I get hooked on a large display, then I&#x27;ve killed the fundamental utility of the laptop—to be productive <i>anywhere</i>. If I suddenly need a 30&quot; screen to feel as productive as &quot;normal&quot; then my laptop is useless to me. A tethered laptop is not portable any more. I <i>really</i> enjoy the freedom to work on my couch, in an office, coffee shop, or on a whim, out in the backyard on a nice day, without ever feeling like I&#x27;m compromised.<p>2) The current batch of 30&quot; displays are not high DPI. Compared to my latop screen they look pixelated and downright primitive. That seems to be changing with these announced screens and I&#x27;m happy about that.<p>Also, there&#x27;s technically a #3, which is that anything larger than my 24&quot; monitor will not fit on the desk that I have (it has a self that isn&#x27;t adjustable or removable). But that&#x27;s kind of a weak reason and I could probably fix it if I really cared.",1386063365

I think the OP shows a scene with some humility, and I don&#x27;t think anyone is claiming that live coding is a panacea, but live coding is not &quot;all hype&quot;.<p>Live coding brings up interesting aesthetic and political issues (see &#x27;speaking code&#x27;, MIT press), as well as research questions and potential wider impacts (both recently validated via intensive research council blind peer review). If you&#x27;re a computer music person, check the upcoming Spring issue of Computer Music Journal for some interesting perspectives.<p>Algorave comes into the category of &#x27;serious fun&#x27;, and we have attracted audiences in the 200 range.<p>&quot;Algorave is the future of electronic music&quot; is a ridiculous statement by a sub-editor. Algorithms are part of the history of electronic music, and part of the future, but we&#x27;re not striving to replace existing EDM production techniques or anything.<p>There have been pretty big international festivals dedicated to live coding in a few different countries. Last month I live coded in front of hundreds of non-live coders at a diverse range of events. The biggest was probably in Denmark, in the hundreds.<p>I wasn&#x27;t there, but understand that Mandelbrots gig is outside, playing at midnight headlining a big stage. It&#x27;s clearly a polished performance, but I believe they did four performances during that festival, half of which were blank slate.<p>Some pre-compose parts which they manipulate, some (including myself) go from a blank page. I thought you were in favour of composition, personally I love to improvise as much as possible live.<p>&quot;Give it a go in the US sometime&quot; - woah, you are special, aren&#x27;t you? I don&#x27;t know why live coding hasn&#x27;t caught on so much in the US, it could be something to do with the top-down laptop orchestra model there, I don&#x27;t know though, I&#x27;ve never been.

Like in going from mathematics to physics, in real-world software engineering is no longer sufficient for conclusions to follow logically from the premises, since the premises now also have to be true in the real world conditions. Having non-leaky abstractions only shifts the moment in which the shift from pure thought to empiricism has to happen.<p>It seems to me that you actually use the notion of being &quot;formal&quot; in an informal (sic) way.

6839338,comment,6833862,6835712,1,0,thaumasiotes,,,"> Torture can only possibly get useful information if the person you&#x27;re torturing HAS that information. Of course that can work -- no one doubts that.<p>You are wrong.  For many people it is an item of faith that torture cannot produce useful information.  In my opinion, these people are generally overattached to the principle that good results come from (morally) good acts, and evil acts necessarily produce bad results.",1386061482

As a result, if something was socially important enough to make it into early generations of featurephones in Japan back in the day, it is now in Unicode.<p>Cats/dogs made the cut, along with a bunch of characters which are a bit more esoteric by Western standards, such as a pictograph representing hot springs or the silhouette of Mt.

1301551,comment,1301363,1301363,0,0,crazydiamond,,,"I wrote a gem in ruby a year or so back using 1.8. When 1.9 came out, it was extremely easy to port it.<p>OTOH, I've been hearing that people have written books for Python 3 which hasn;t taken off. Now they are backporting their books to 2.x (e.g Dive into ..).<p>There is a negative side too. Everyone's writing gems. There are plenty of gems floating around, some incomplete some abandoned, its hard to tell. When i worked in Java years back, aside from the Java distribution itself, i used to use libs from jakarta.apache. One knew they would be maintaining it, and the quality would be good.<p>In Ruby, i really don't know of any such company or initiative, that maintains libraries. It's too open. I get frightened when i download a gem which has many dependencies, since sooner or later some deps are going to break. That's happened several times. Even some of the well-known rubyists abandon their gems and don't respond to mails or bug reports since they are busy in ruby confs, or setting up their startups.<p>Then there's the gem creation process, which seems to be changing. I typically tend to google (maybe this is my fault) and i get outdated docs on creating a gem or publishing it. Hopefully, the ruby-lang.org site has an updated link on suggested or preferred way to create a gem. Every time i create a new version of my gem (it uses hoe), it seems hoe has changed, and I struggle to find a sample to correct it.<p>However, I love ruby too.",1272463145

It's a lot like any other interest, passion, or activity. People tend to gravitate and associate more with people that share commonalities, probably because you are naturally more interested in what they have to say/do.

1301529,comment,1301086,1301145,0,0,DCoder,,,"In my experience (limited to single threaded code though), modern C++ compilers (especially MSVC which does a better job than GCC in general) optimize really well. It's interesting to compare the assembly generated for the same operations in VC6 and VC2008/2010.<p>In line with what was mentioned below, VC6 used a series of lea to seek (a*x+b)th byte in a structure whereas VC2010 just uses a single multiply.<p>And something I was surprised by, VC6 always used fnstsw ax; test ax, 40h; jz $+16; to compare floating point values. VC2010 uses jp instead, I'd presume for a good reason as well.<p>Anecdote: One time and one time only I witnessed GCC write more ""clever"" code than MSVC, though I haven't benchmarked this:<p><pre><code>  switch(val) {
   case 1:
   case 2:
   case 6:
   case 15:
    return foo;
   default:
    return bar;
  }
</code></pre>
Both compilers returned > 15 normally, but optimized differently: MSVC compiled this into a normal two-step jumptable<p><pre><code>  mov eax, table1[dl] // assuming dl contains val, table1 contains either 1 for bar or 0 for foo
  jmp table2[al] // contains addresses of two branches
</code></pre>
GCC did the equivalent of this:<p><pre><code>  return ((1 << val) & ((1 << 1) | (1 << 2) | (1 << 6) | (1 << 15)))
   ? foo
   : bar
  ;</code></pre>",1272462748

1301494,comment,1301423,1301423,0,0,gfodor,,,"This experience is emphasized even more if you work in a language with a REPL, like Clojure. The only value of tests, at that point, are to protect against regressions. The testing process with a REPL happens faster and more organically than writing unit tests, but it's less structured and harder to formalize. It's like comparing a structured debate to a conversation.<p>What someone needs to do (and I'll do eventually) is implement a REPL enhancement that allows ""test capture"". Namely, if you have recently evaluated one or more expressions, execute a ""capture"" command that extracts the working environment (locals, globals), the previous statements you've run, and their evaluated results, and outputs one or more unit tests. For example, a session with clojure might look like this:<p>> (def x 1)<p>> (def y 2)<p>> (+ x y)<p>3<p>> capture!<p>-- Saved capture001.clj<p>(1 test passed, 0 tests failed.)<p>Where capture.clj contains a test similiar to:<p>(def x 1)<p>(def y 2)<p>(def expected-result 3)<p>(assert-equal (+ x y) expected-result)<p>Fuzzy, and I apologize as I don't know the clojure unit testing syntax, but you get the idea.

The longer term paper on the loans will historically have a higher probability of failure, so the longer term paper has lower ratings.<p>Then the recursion occurs.<p>1) Homeowners kept refinancing their houses (encouraged by the insatiable appetite for new mortgages to slice and dice into AAA-rated paper), so their loans never aged, they just kept getting reset.<p>2) The bankers took the remaining less-than-AAA-rated aggregated debt and used to create a <i>new</i> debt vehicle and then claimed <i>all over again</i> that the ""new"" debt (which was really old debt reheated) could be re-sliced into AAA-rated debt plus residual lower rated debt.<p>This quickly turns into a house of cards which inevitably failed when short term history (low failure rates based on long held mortgages and ""perpetually"" increasing house values) failed to model reality.",1272461851

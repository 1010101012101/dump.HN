It is, however, fully deterministic.<p>Of course as you hint in your comment, at a lower level hardware is prone to failures and lack determinism: bugs in the cpu, ram corruption (ECC-ram is of course better), data corruption everywhere on storage/network/data links, etc. Ever heard a gamer bitching about Windows 7 instability? That&#x27;s not Windows, but overclocking not quite under control and/or insufficient cooling...<p>And when all is under control a cosmic ray might still wreak your bits havoc.",1408323536
8191044,comment,8185610,8188680,2,0,lilsunnybee,,,"Perhaps could it be that you have never had properly ripe, healthy cantaloupe? In US supermarkets at least most fruits are unripe, or rotten, or unripe and rotten at the same time.<p>For anyone unaware the most helpful signal for picking properly ripe melons is smell. Unripe melons will usually have no smell at all, while overly ripe ones will have hints of a rotten fruit odor mixed in, even while still being completely firm in feel. The outside of an uncut melon should smell sweet and fragrant through and through, and just one sniff should be enough to tell which fruits should be passed over without a second thought.<p>For already chopped melon a lot of times it&#x27;s a gamble, and odds are bad. In the US at least most fruit salad preparers are barely payed, and likely not even given the basic authority to be selective about what fruit they chop up in the first place. Basically no one cares how properly ripe or palatable the fruit is, and so sadly-often it simply tastes like oh so much disgusting garbage.<p>Unfortunately melons are some of the worst-affected victims in the race-to-the-bottom world of modern mass-production fruit, along with apples, pears, tomatoes and olives. Like with humans when no one cares to begin with crime is much much more common.",1408323521

And search problems will game the system: if you ask a computer to design the fastest plane possible it will probably design one that has no space for a pilot, unless you specifically ask it to.<p>I used to think that the best example of fuzziness is that people are way better than computers at deciding whether something is a chair, but then I found out about LEVAN.<p>Then I saw what it thought were beanbag chairs : <a href=""http://levan.cs.washington.edu/?state=fetchNGrams&concept=chair"" rel=""nofollow"">http://levan.cs.washington.edu/?state=fetchNGrams&concept=ch...</a><p>I&#x27;m not too scared of the computer apocalypse yet.",1408323477

Deciding not to worry about cholesterol may fit with your value system, but is unlikely to benefit your health. As a doctor, it would be reasonable to try to convince you of the benefit of caring about cholesterol, and then working with you to improve your health along the axes in which you are interested in making changes. If cholesterol is not one of them, that shouldn&#x27;t sever the remainder of the therapeutic relationship. In other words, your physician may have recognized that global optimization sometimes requiring abandoning local optimizations (such as cholesterol control, in this case).<p>Obviously I don&#x27;t know anything of the specifics of your case, but yours is an interesting comment.",1408323331

8191034,comment,8189070,8190558,1,0,rcthompson,,,"Well, you probably used a calorie budget based on a few simple statistics like your sex, height, and weight. With individual differences is metabolic rates, it&#x27;s very possible that your &quot;slight calorie deficit&quot; was actually breaking even for your individual calorie usage. Just as likely is that the nutrition info on labels is imprecise or even systematically inaccurate. For example, I believe there are penalties if your box says it contains 1 pound and it actually contains less, but there&#x27;s no penalty for putting in more, since only in the former case is the consumer getting shortchanged, and this asymmetry probably creates an incentive for systematic underestimation of net weights, and therefore underestimation of calories per food package.<p>Probably some combination of these factors explains why you need to &quot;ear FAR less than you should need to&quot; based on how the math works out.

It&#x27;s why you can buy a house and feel safe that the ceiling won&#x27;t collapse on top of you. It&#x27;s why you can visit a cinema and feel safe that there are enough fire exits and alarms and a sensible evacuation plan.<p>All of these regulations aren&#x27;t in place just because officious bureaucrats wanted to clog up the smooth workings of a free, capitalist society, they exist because historically, when they weren&#x27;t, people died. For proof, go and read about some of the nightclub and theatre fires that happened a hundred years ago, in which hundreds of people burned to death.<p>When there&#x27;s a immediate link between malfeasance and harm, it&#x27;s easy to see that the government should step in, introducing building codes and hygiene standards to ensure it can&#x27;t happen again. When the harm is delayed, the link feels more tenuous, even if it&#x27;s really not. Companies that pollute are contributing to potentially catastrophic disruption of the biosphere and global warming, but it doesn&#x27;t happen overnight, so people treat it as less wrong than building a nightclub with no fire exits. It isn&#x27;t.<p>Likewise, food companies who aggressively promote nutritionally dangerous foodstuffs cereals at children, while promoting them as healthy, are doing harm. They&#x27;re doing it knowingly, and they&#x27;re paying to distort scientific and political processes in order to keep doing it.<p>It&#x27;s easy to trumpet individual choice as all important, but reality is not an individualist pipe dream. The average person is not well informed about dietary science and never will be, and many children cannot make a choice at all, let alone an informed one. In the face of the wealth and marketing power of large food companies, people have no chance on their own, and they levels of obesity in modern societies are clear proof of that.<p>Food regulation isn&#x27;t about the government telling people what they can eat. It&#x27;s about the government telling food companies that they can&#x27;t produce food that&#x27;s dangerous, in the long term as well as the short term. Just like the government tells companies they can&#x27;t produce cars that fly apart on the highway, or buildings that fall down in a strong wind.<p>Regulation of dangerous business practices is exactly what government <i>should</i> be doing it. It&#x27;s the reason why all the other nonsense governments do is worth putting up with. It protects people from irresponsible companies, and it protects responsible companies from being undercut by irresponsible companies.",1408320089

6349130,comment,6347557,6348371,5,0,crazygringo,,,"> <i>Nobody is willing to accept responsibility for the problems and everybody believes they will somehow be resolved without their personal intervention.</i><p>But not without reason. Making a difference requires coordination. Coordination at such a large level requires government action (companies/NGO&#x27;s/charities/etc. can&#x27;t do it). And for climate/environment-related things, often action on the part of several/many/all governments.<p>But the fact is, the way democracies are built, they tend to be bad at this, and there&#x27;s lots of research to back that up. People don&#x27;t vote on candidates based on unproven consequencies that are decades from now, period. And non-democracies aren&#x27;t going to worry about this stuff too much either.<p>Things change for reasons, which involve clear incentives. &quot;Accepting responsibility&quot; on a personal level doesn&#x27;t really have a lot to do with it, I&#x27;m afraid, unless you&#x27;re a world leader, and even as a world leader, you&#x27;re awfully constrained in what you do.",1378655968

How many of those people would eat the amount of fruit in that smoothie over the course of a normal day? There might be something to be said for getting your daily dose of fruit at once instead of spread out over the day, but I doubt that we&#x27;re talking about people that are overdosing on fruit.<p>> sugary smoothies and fruit juices<p>How is a smoothie <i>more</i> sugary than eating the equivalent amount of fruit? Do you claim that someone eating a bowl of strawberries is having a sugary snack?<p>> That&#x27;s what makes smoothies particularly dangerous<p>How dangerous are they really? Plenty of people will drink > 2 litres of soda over the course of a day. On the other hand, do you think that anyone is drinking more than even a litre of smoothie in a day?<p>> But you just saw them grind up 8 oranges, 5 bananas, and 2 pounds of strawberries and put them in a single cup.<p>Really? I make smoothies at home, and it&#x27;s more like: 2 leaves of kale, protein powder, a banana or two, and a handful (or 2) of frozen strawberries (and maybe an apple or pear). This makes enough smoothie for 2 adults and a child. Are you really don&#x27;t to claim that this isn&#x27;t something that could be eaten in a sitting by 2 adults and a child?",1378655934

My parents don&#x27;t run a ton of acres, but they definitely make a living off of it.<p>Fossil Fuels/Brittleness\nIt &#x27;used&#x27; to be everyone at least rotated crops every year (corn, soy, wheat, corn) to put nitrogen back in the soil in a more natural process. Now, the rotations are more like corn, corn, corn, soy, corn. Since the soybeans aren&#x27;t there to put nitrogen back in the soil, farmers use literal tons of oil produced nitrogen. When gas prices are high, my dad&#x27;s not complaining about the 300 gallons of diesel a day per tractor he&#x27;s using. He&#x27;s talking about the increase in nitrogen prices.  The price increases have made it so that farmers used to be able to break even at about 2.50 a bushel for corn. Now its something like 4.50. That&#x27;s a huge jump when you&#x27;re now getting 200+ bushels per acre and in the 1990&#x27;s 170 bushels was a great year.<p>Diversity\nA few years ago (can&#x27;t quite remember) there was a huge scare of European corn borer destroying all of one type of corn.

6349101,comment,6340356,6346351,2,0,rehack,,,"<i></i>>Do you know where that reduced average latency is coming from? Is it because nginx is serving static assets that would tie up an apache worker that could be running/serving PHP in apache? If so, you can do the same thing by offloading all your static asset serving to another server (or a completely external CDN, which has other extremely beneficial client-side advantages too) using apache too. That is, the choice of software here isn&#x27;t as big a win as presented, it&#x27;s the architecture of the ecosystem that is the big influence.<i></i><p>Yes, I understand that. I have studied about the C10K problem[1]. And have coded another service which just uses libevent[2] directly and some C++ code to serve a feature for our site very low latency. So I understand quite well why Nginx is offering low latency.<p>As you rightly observe later on, I don&#x27;t have the luxury to get obsessed with all the Whys, so often shoot for the major architectural gain and take any side effects that come along in the stride.<p><i></i>>.. But the way you&#x27;ve presented it doesn&#x27;t indicate well that all the causes and effects are completely understood. And I think this ends up giving Apache a bad rap.<i></i><p>I am surprised by your this observation. I have been 100% honest in what I wrote above, and I repeat have a huge respect and thankful for the Apache team and Apache web server software. Just that, by the page loading gains we got, were clearly very good. And also there were less errors in general reported in the web master. So we stuck with the change.<p>Also a point regarding the switching costs and extra processing between php-fpm and Nginx processes. As I said in my first comment, we do mainly Java and PHP is just for the blog. But I very clearly remember seeing all the Apache child procs bloating to 25 Mb after the first hit to the PHP code was done. So I am actually saving by externalizing on the resources. Trust me I know what I am doing.<p>Another tangential thing not related to Nginx, which I am doing for low resource consumption. Is moving some relevant code from Java to Go. And there also am seeing huge memory gains (i.e. savings). Perhaps will share more about it at an appropriate time.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html</a><p>[2] libevent.org<p>Edit: grammar",1378655515

Here are some suggestions: Enable replication master/slaves+, assuming you have a read heavy architecture. Enable the &quot;<i>The Slow Query Log</i>&quot; [1], which will give you something like /var/log/mysql-slowquery.log, then you can look in here to find queries that take a long time. Find out what the bottleneck is, I&#x27;m willing to best you have limited I/O and that is the source of your issues, can you use memcached [2] to limit the database hit rate? You need to remove/limit direct access to the database when people get duplicate data out.<p>Before you start to optimize I would profile things to get a baseline for how many select/inserts you are doing and how long they are taking, and system load, etc. Based off your 100M statement, you are doing roughly 1157.4 inserts/s.

Look at the history of banana cultivars. Up until the 1950s the most common variety of banana grown commercially was the &#x27;Gros Michel&#x27;. Vast tracts of banana plantation of this single variety were wiped out by Panama disease which spread around the world. A different cultivar, the &#x27;Cavendish&#x27; was found to be resistant to the strain of Panama disease that afflicted the Gros Michel. The transition was at great economic cost and it was fortuitous that a resistant variety of banana was discovered.<p><a href=""http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/PanamaDiseasePart1.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Pana...</a><p><i>The first trades relied almost entirely on Gros Michel (28,32). In many ways, Gros Michel is an ideal export banana. It produces massive bunches of large, flavorful fruit that are so resistant to mechanical damage that they could be shipped intact. The downfall of Gros Michel was its extreme susceptibility to Panama disease.</i><p><i>Panama disease was first reported in Australia, but became most important in the monocultures of Gros Michel that were used by the trades in the Western Hemisphere. Panama was one of the first countries to experience major epidemics. It caused staggering losses in the trades before production areas converted to Cavendish. Between 1940 and 1960, 30,000 ha were lost in the Ulua Valley of Honduras, and in a decade complete losses were recorded in operations of 4,000 ha in Suriname and 6,000 ha in the Quepos area in Costa Rica. If one compiles figures up to 1960 and considers the substantial costs that were associated with plantation establishment, losses of approximately $400,000,000 can be attributed to Panama disease. Using a conservative conversion rate, this would be at least $2.3 billion in 2000 figures, and would be even greater if costs were included for unemployment, abandoned villages, unrealized income, and expenditures to maintain social stability in the affected regions.</i><p>I&#x27;m sure you can guess what happens next. A strain of Panama disease that affects the Cavendish has appeared:<p><a href=""http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/PanamaDiseasePart2.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apsnet.org/publications/apsnetfeatures/Pages/Pana...</a><p><i>The confidence that Panama disease would not affect the Cavendish clones was shattered in the early 1990s. New Cavendish plantations began to succumb throughout Southeast Asia, the home of banana. This represented the first time that Cavendish was affected in the tropics in the absence of predisposing factors.</i><p><i>The appearance of TR4 in Southeast Asia has changed this assessment. Once again the banana on which the export trades depend is threatened with destruction by Panama disease. Also affected are the important plantain cultivars that feed some 400 million people, as well as numerous cooking and dessert cultivars. In total, TR4 threatens more than 80% of the worlds banana production. Activities to monitor its spread and develop contingency plans for its arrival in other areas should be started as soon as possible.</i>",1378655003

Of course there are also issues with UDRP&#x27;s and law firms reverse hijacking domains but that&#x27;s an entirely different subject.<p>Lastly of course people who can&#x27;t get the domain they want always will throw around the &quot;c&quot; word as if it&#x27;s simply not fair that they can&#x27;t have what they want when they want it.

This is going to be a little counter-intuitive to standard startup culture advice, but generally, the engineering effort to optimize databases past the initial live flow is not worth throwing money at the problem. You have to weigh the fixed cost of the optimization and the variable cost of the upkeep of the system against simply patching the system for now.<p>If you are willing to throw money at the problem, which you seem like you&#x27;re wavering on, here are some options on how to throw money at the problem:<p>1. If you are willing to be hands on and maintain your MySQL cluster yourselves, you should move away from EC2 (I am presuming) and to a local collo where you can install super fatty SSD computers with massive RAID setups that will greatly improve your performance per server (on the magnitude of up to 10x)<p>2. You can do a hybrid solution with your existing infrastructure. It sounds like a lot of the data is not necessarily going to be used that much (tracking all events probably, from what I am assuming, or something big data intensive like that), you can throw that into a separate database infrastructure.<p>If my assumption is correct, I am presuming you are using a large portion for the database for stat tracking, and not user information, then the &quot;proper&quot; way to throw it somewhere is to put it into S3 as fat logs that you can later use something like map reduce to process. Other options for more efficient storage are Redis and MongoDB.<p>3. We have taken this to the extreme and actually moved all of our live data to DynamoDB. It is a NoSql database storage system operated by Amazon. This has let us concentrate on features and the user experience. The cost is our database is probably 5-10 times more expensive than a self rolled Redis SSD backed equivalent hosted at our local collo.<p>------<p>Just some other general database scaling advice for MySQL. The steps to scaling your MySQL database for live use are as follows:<p>1. Do not use any relational calls on your data. Relational calls are useful for databases that aren&#x27;t used to manage live web transactions as it can seriously back up your system.<p>2. Put indexes on all of your heavily used columns for finding data.<p>3. Look at the slow queries and optimize those queries out.<p>4.

At our patient conferences, not being to cite articles to back up your treatment plan would be considered an embarrassment.<p>I think this article puts psychiatry&#x27;s dilemma into some good perspective:\n<a href=""http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dsm-5-and-the-fight-for-the-heart-of-psychiatry/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/dsm-5-and-the-fight-for-...</a><p>I do think that it&#x27;s interesting how people conceive of psychiatry. We cannot really objectively measure or test pain. There&#x27;s no blood test or scan that confirms it. But as everyone has experienced it, nobody doubts it exists. There&#x27;s migraine headaches, which are, like psychiatric illness, diagnosed based on history and symptoms. It&#x27;s pretty uncontroversial. Yet, as everyone believes themselves to be an expert in behavior, if they have not experienced or known someone with mental illness, it&#x27;s suddenly all invented.",1378654322

6348948,comment,6348468,6348832,6,0,sillysaurus2,,,"Yes, my apologies.  My comment was overly blunt.<p>The reason paranoia is important in post-2013 crypto is because the NSA&#x27;s knowledge of crypto is very likely ahead of academia / public sector knowledge.  They&#x27;ve historically used that advanced knowledge to influence past standards.  In one case, they seem to have secretly enhanced the security of DES.[1]  But in another case, evidence suggests they may have secretly put a backdoor into their Dual_EC_DRBG proposal.[2]<p>This raises the question:  Should we worry about NSA tampering with proposals?  If that&#x27;s our goal, then it seems to me that our most powerful tool is trust: the fact that we can almost always trust tptacek, cperciva, the Mozilla Security team, and other established names.  It&#x27;s not that they&#x27;re infallible --- rather, it&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve always been genuine with their intentions, and have spent years building up that level of trust, so it would be a huge risk for them to be willing parties in NSA tampering.<p>Therefore, if someone is proposing a new standard, scrutinizing their reputation would seem to be a necessary first step.  If their knowledge is secretly ahead of the public sector&#x27;s, and their proposal contains a secret flaw, then no one will be able to spot it.  What else is there to examine if not our level of trust in their established reputation?<p>So if we choose to believe that the NSA is ahead of public sector knowledge, then it seems like it&#x27;s valid to be concerned about identity and reputation, because it&#x27;s inherently impossible to rely on the public sector to spot any hidden influences in the proposal, unless the public sector happens to make the same sort of cryptographic breakthroughs that we presume the NSA to have made.<p>I apologize for bringing it up in a disrespectful way.  I didn&#x27;t mean to dig into Brian&#x27;s life.  The LinkedIn profile just happened to stand out in a quick google search.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, all I&#x27;m trying to do here is ask the community: should we be concerned about NSA tampering?  If so, should we assume their knowledge is ahead of the public sector&#x27;s?  If we assume that, then what else can we do except scrutinize identity/trust (since if we assume advanced knowledge, then we can&#x27;t rely solely on scrutinizing the content of their proposal)? I honestly don&#x27;t know whether those are valid concerns going forward, or whether they should be taken so seriously.  I&#x27;m hoping the community will decide.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#NSA.27s_involvement_in_the_design"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Encryption_Standard#NSA.27...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG</a>",1378653481

All this has been working reasonably well for us so far.<p>But now, with rising traffic levels, things are beginning to slow down again.<p>At this point, we&#x27;re considering the following 3 options:<p>1) Throw more hardware resources at it \nPro: Instant gratification :)  Cons: Cost + vicious cycle(?)<p>2) Try to optimize the database/config, table structures and queries further \nPro: Always useful   Cons: Time + Effort<p>and<p>3) Migrate to PostgreSQL (or something else?)\nPros/Cons: Still studying<p>What do HNers with experience in such matters suggest?

But it seems plausible we can convert jellyfish into useful substances or derivatives.<p>Even still, the article addresses deeper problems. Killing back the jellyfish won&#x27;t stop the conditions that we are causing in the oceans -- conditions that are extremely suitable to jellyfish, and seem suitable to little else. Acidification, warming, pollution, etc.<p>One little-heralded fact, for instance, is that we&#x27;re coming dangerously close to driving sharks to extinction in many of the world&#x27;s ecosystems. An ocean with fewer sharks in it? It&#x27;s tough to find people who will shed a tear. But killing off the keystone predators in an ecosystem throws the whole thing into chaos -- and as it turns out, paradoxically, killing off sharks is a fantastic way to kill off most of the fish sharks feed on.<p>The point of my digression is that doing something about the &quot;jellyfish menace&quot; is probably necessary at this point.

If you monitor this and make the reports available to me for my subdomain, I'll know that someone has at least read my email. If they click on the link and you make the web stats available to me for my subdomain, I'll know that someone visited my resume online (you'll need to do some virtual host wildcarding on your web server).

Sometimes you bid on a project where you say to yourself ""oh yea! I'm getting $300/hr for this"" but what happens is as it drags on you try to clock less time to justify the rate and just start guesstimating. In reality if you clock meetings, calls, time responding to emails, documentation, research, project planning etc the rate always ends up being much, much lower. Its not just time coding.<p>Anyhow not saying that's your situation, but I think a lot of people who claim high rates forget about non-production hours when they make their project quotes.<p>But having Java and Perl skills are definitely more valuable than just PHP...

And because most business processes are, at bottom, computer algorithms, the Supreme Court’s judgment could also bar all sorts of software patents in the process. As a result, a lot of patents for online shopping, medical-diagnostic tests and procedures for executing trades on Wall Street could be invalidated.<p>The roots of the dispute go back more than a decade to two inventors, Bernard Bilski and Rand Warsaw, who sought to patent a method of hedging weather-related risks in energy prices. The USPTO concluded that the process was too abstract and denied the application. On appeal, the Federal Circuit actually upheld the patent office’s decision—and said, crucially, that the process would be eligible for a patent only if it was “tied to a particular machine or apparatus” or if it “transformed a particular article into a different state or thing”. Failing on both counts, the inventors took their case to the Supreme Court, which has been pondering for the past few months whether the “machine-or-transformation” test is an appropriate standard. It is hard to conclude it is not. """,1265405774

What beef does Apple have with Fusion Ads or The Deck, and application developers that currently use them?<p>In truth, I'm not even convinced that they intend to open up that ad network for third-party developers, and not simply use it for themselves.

Similarly, the iPhone had a killer feature - a mobile web browser that actually worked. Also, both products were polished versions of devices whose commercial viability had been established for decades.<p>The iPad lacks a selling point. It plays music, but it's too large to replace a portable music player. It doesn't support the codecs that 99% of the video files people view today are encoded with, and has a poor aspect ratio for watching 16:9 TV or movies. It has a fancy ebook reader application, but I'm betting that glossy LCD screen will be unreadable in direct sunlight. And it has a web browser that works well on a phone, but will probably feel very constraining on a full-size device.<p>It seems as if Apple believes the touch interface itself is the compelling feature that justifies the iPad, rather than anything you might do with it. I'm skeptical - touch-based computers have been disappointing marketeers for the last twenty years. They have a certain cachet, but other interfaces are less frustrating in practice. The iPhone is probably the best-case scenario for touch, and yet there's still a huge market for phones with a physical keyboard.<p>In short, I'm still waiting to see a reason why someone would buy an iPad over a task-specific device or a laptop. (Particularly for $500+ a pop) Nothing in iPhone OS 3.2 is compelling enough to sell to a mainstream audience, IMO. Of course, the iPod and iPhone had significant issues in their first iteration as well, but Apple addressed them in subsequent generations and they'll hopefully apply the same treatment to the iPad.

It's also why I find the Android tablets that are in development, like the MSI Harmony, much more appealing than the iPad: Android multitasks.<p>But I do also recognize I'm not the iPad's target market.<p>On a somewhat unrelated note, I suspect a lot of the iPad hate, particularly regarding no multitasking, isn't so much the idea of making a device that normal people can use so much as it is the idea that <i>this</i> is the sum total of the future of computing: specialized devices that uni-task, attempt to lock us into specific content providers, lock up our data in apps rather than letting us have free access to the file system, and so on. In other words -- it's not so much about what it currently is, but rather the potential future it represents. I think those fears are a bit overblown, but I definitely empathize with them. I'd hate having a computer that (for example) forced me to use iPhoto or Aperture or Lightroom or Picasa to manage my photos rather than just keeping them in a nicely organized file structure that I created.<p>But at any rate, I think there's room enough in computing for both approaches and I don't understand why various groups on both sides seem so anxious to strip those choices away from everyone else. Which is to say: I don't think anyone who is confused by a file system or windowed multitasking is a drooling idiot who shouldn't be allowed to use the Internet, but I also don't appreciate the simplicity advocates telling me that I should get over it because I don't need the ability to multi-task or be able to see multiple programs at once anyway. There's room for both approaches and I suspect there'll always be a <i>need</i> for both.",1265404751

1104888,comment,1104640,1104640,0,0,jrockway,,,"It seems strange to me that some of the most important software is written in some of the easiest-to-mess-up languages.  When we are writing a web application to share 140 character messages with our friends, everything is high-level.  There are no blocks of memory, or bits to twiddle that change the hardware configuration, etc., etc.  You have to go pretty far out of your way for your application to not work correctly, and then you have extensive unit tests to make sure you don't do that.  The possibility of a bug in your application affecting other applications, or the OS, or the hardware is pretty much exactly zero.  You aren't even <i>allowed</i> to write code that could be incorrect, like casting pointers or indexing into memory you didn't allocate.<p>Then there are embedded systems that control missile batteries or commercial aircraft, and to save money on processors, everything is implemented in the lowest-level language possible.  You have some registers and a block of memory.  The programmer has to manage the hardware configuration, manage memory, make sure he never writes outside of an array, make sure he never treat one pointer as a pointer of another type, etc.  If you accidentally forget to do any of those things exactly right, even once in a million lines of code, the device can kill 500 people.  And that's not even including bugs in the actual control algorithm... which you don't have much time to get right, since making the computer work at all is the hard part.<p>Anyway, it would be nice to see the embedded industry as a whole start using a programming language that can ensure some minimal amount of correctness at compile-time.  Add a bit of expressiveness to the language so that describing complex algorithms is only a few lines of code, and I think we won't be hearing much about embedded software failing.<p>My guess, though, is that this will never happen; for the same reason that soft drinks are sweetened with high fructose corn syrup instead of sugar.  Saving 0.01 cents times a hundred million units means massive profits.  Saving a few cents by using a low-level but dangerous programming languages, and then paying out a few wrongful death settlements is probably cheaper than spec-ing better hardware.  Externalities, gotta love 'em.<p>Edit: I see things like Atom (<a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/atom</a>) as hope for the future.

Should be clear why that is bold or all should be bold or none at all.)<p>- Information and typography are very important elements. Graphics are only there if you really need it but personally, I don't think they are necessary if you are only placing them in there to just have a graphic.<p>- The graphics you currently use for your project listing should be the same width (height may differ). Some are longer, some are shorter and it makes it difficult to scan the content.<p>- Run the text for each project across the entire page and avoid cramming text from two or more sections on a single horizontal section. It makes the readability of the text difficult since in some cases you only have 3 words across before it continues below.<p>- Think about spacing on your layout. The top navigation should be straight across in this current structure, not alternating upper and lower. You are only wasting space without purpose. Shrink the font size, remove the bold or remove the uppercase and keep it all on one line.<p>- You need more padding between sections (e.g. your intro statement, current and past projects).

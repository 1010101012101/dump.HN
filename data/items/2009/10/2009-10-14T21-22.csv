It's as much about safety as anything else:<p><i>For some applications there is a concern that halogenated plastic materials will release corrosive and toxic gases if ignited in a fire. The corrosive element of these gases has the potential to damage electronics wherever the smoke travels, and the toxic element can be potentially hazardous to persons if they cannot easily evacuate from the area.</i><p><i>Applications where corrosion potential is of particular concern include communications data centers and phone switching stations with large amounts of expensive electronics. As a case in point the fire called “the worst disaster in telecommunications history” occurred on May 8th 1988 in a Hinsdale, IL Central Office facility for Illinois Bell. The fire cut local service to 35,000 suburban Chicago phone customers and was estimated to have cost many millions of dollars in recovery cost. In the after effects of the fire the central processor of the phone switch, which was not directly involved in the fire, had to be replaced reportedly due to the effects of acid corrosion.</i><p><i>The toxicity of smoke is of highest concern within enclosed spaces where means of escape by persons are limited; examples include mass transit rail cars, ships, and Offshore Oil and Gas platforms. There have been several tragic fires that have occurred involving transit vehicles over recent years that have brought heightened concern to this issue. In a February 2003 incident, news reports of a fire involving two trains in a Daegu, South Korea subway station told of how toxic fumes and heavy black smoke prevented firefighters from making a quick rescue of those trapped. 120 were killed and many others injured in that incident.</i><p><a href=""http://www.gocsc.com/uploads/white_papers/E47B142616A84C3F90BD14CD010B7FD5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gocsc.com/uploads/white_papers/E47B142616A84C3F90...</a>",1255556751

882186,comment,882110,882110,0,0,kurtosis,,,"This type of language can be confusing.  It is not a ""real"" magnetic monopole but an ""emergent"" one.  The collective behavior of all of the spins in the material shows the experimental signatures of a magnetic monopole.  The idea is pretty simple to visualize - if you take a normal solenoid, the magnetic flux lines come out of one end and return into the other end.  If you take the solenoid and stretch it into an infinitely long infinitesimally thin string the magnetic flux coming out of one end looks exactly like the magnetic field of a monopole.  This is an old idea called the ""dirac string"".  In these spin ice materials the magnetic moments of the rare earth atoms in the crystal are ""geometrically frustrated"" and cannot become all aligned or anti-aligned as in a normal magnetic material - so they apparently arrange themselves into strings, and the ends of the strings look like monopoles. (note that a line of tiny dipoles has approximately the same field as a solenoid)<p>Here are some other simple examples of particles with ""emergent"" properties:<p>(-) The conduction electrons in metals interact with the ions in the lattice as well as with each other through electrostatic forces, nonetheless they can be approximately described as a gas of non interacting electrons with a different ""effective mass"".  In some cases (e.g. graphene, bismuth) the ""effective mass"" can be zero, in other cases (e.g. actinide compounds) they can be nearly as heavy as a proton. Of course the electron mass is still ~10^-30 kg<p>(-) In semiconductors, when an electron is removed from the filled valence band (e.g. by doping) it leaves behind a ""hole"" which behaves like a positively charged particle.  negative charged electrons and positively charged holes can actually interact to form an ""atom"" called an exciton which shows a spectrum just like a hydrogen atom.  This is a collective ""emergent"" behavior of the entire semiconductor - there aren't really positively charged particles or hydrogen-like atoms in the semiconductor.<p>there are many other more exotic examples",1255555345

They would not be looking askance at the 'sociopath' types; whereas another type of person might be saying, ""Hmm, these executives are making 100x as much as me, and yet my work is quite critical to this business.  Is that really fair?"" etc.<p>Again, I want to emphasize that I realize these terms are shockingly harsh--and of course, if we're staying with this analysis, one or another of them applies to every single person in a (medium to) large organization.  I'm trying to use them in a neutral, not inherently insulting way, even if that's almost impossible to do :)  I'm just trying to extend the analysis of the article a little, and so I kind of have to use its terms (and of course, it wouldn't have drawn as much attention if it were phrased in a more neutral way, etc.)<p>It could be that the original article's analysis is just flawed, which I would consider a valid position, etc.--but I'm just going along with its terms because they do seem to fit shockingly well (to the point that the whole thing seems like a bit of a punch in the gut when I re-analyze some past experiences).",1255554300

The starting salary for a software engineer out of college can be as high as $75,000-$95,000. They can live a <i>very comfortable</i> lifestyle, where additional money (outside of ""fuck you money"") just brings diminished returns. This isn't true for many scientists (postdocs generally make a pittance).",1255554201

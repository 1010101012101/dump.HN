I have mixed feelings about it.<p>On the one hand, its very good for high level thinking and writing good, readable code. On the other hand, it slows down your javascript code by at least 2x, which is particularly noticeable if you're doing a javascript intensive application. Then again, the future of browsers is speeding up javascript, so this may not be an issue in a couple of years.<p>My experience with Prototype is that it handles the speed issue much better - however, it is a bloated monster of a framework.",1205382681

And if you do me a favor, I'll remember it. And I won't store it in the front of my brain, I'll store it here, in the back. I'll just get a good feeling next time I get email from you; I won't even remember why. And if you do me a disservice and I get email from you, my temples will start to throb, and I won't even remember why. If you give users a way of remembering one another, reputation will happen, and that requires nothing more than simple and somewhat persistent handles.<p>Users have to be able to identify themselves and there has to be a penalty for switching handles. The penalty for switching doesn't have to be total. But if I change my handle on the system, I have to lose some kind of reputation or some kind of context. This keeps the system functioning.""",1205382426

135729,comment,135238,135424,0,0,skmurphy,,,"I would have to agree. What you want is market exploration: who is your customer. Start talking to them. Ask their opinion of what's missing from current solutions. Don't try and chase existing players, talk to dissatisfied customers and folks who should be customers but aren't--find out why. If you chase the existing players you end up with a large feature set and the need for a large development effort that looks more superset than distinct. Think about features you can delete from existing solutions and still appeal to a segment of users. Think about one or two missing features you can add after you have deleted many of the existing ones.

Feynman's advice was not to be ashamed to work on problems that you feel you can make progress on, however ""humble"" they are, because those are the kind where your work matters.

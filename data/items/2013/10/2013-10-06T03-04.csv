The counter example would be Microsoft that still supported DOS for more than a decade after they moved on from it.<p>I don&#x27;t know any engineers who like maintaining legacy systems, so it seems to be a perk of working with Apple and I also think that this lack of concern for legacy is allowing Apple to move forward faster. At my last job every time a new project was requested by management I would ask, &quot;What old project will we remove then? Because maintenance takes time.&quot; I pretty much never got an answer on that. It takes discipline to stay lean and to non-engineers legacy costs can be invisible a lot of times.<p>One area where I see progress accelerating is XCode. You basically need to be running latest XCode to publish apps to the App Store, so people always run latest. On the other hand, I&#x27;ve got Visual Studio all the way back to 2003 on hand because clients don&#x27;t want to take the time to upgrade. It drives me nuts.<p>There&#x27;s something satisfying about progress and something very depressing to me when I sit down to make changes to a project using Visual Studio 2003 .NET. Anyone know what I mean?",1381031970

6503051,comment,6502756,6502756,5,0,mortenjorck,,,"There are lots of comments here that rightly point out that you have no reasonable expectation of uninterrupted functionality using beta software. But to me, there&#x27;s a bigger, more interesting picture here: There&#x27;s clearly a demand for pre-release Apple software among people who don&#x27;t really have any need for it.<p>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not alone in having seen people this summer running iOS 7 betas on their personal phones, even people with no software development experience who probably couldn&#x27;t tell you what Xcode is. It&#x27;s not in Apple&#x27;s interest for this to be happening, as it leaves a bad taste in people&#x27;s mouth when things like this inevitably happen.<p>Restricting access clearly doesn&#x27;t work. Everyone who knows the beta exists knows someone who can hook them up. There&#x27;s got to be something else, some other way Apple can make these betas less appealing to the casual user, without lessening the betas&#x27; usefulness for people actually trying to test things.",1381031884

I realize that as a developer I should be keeping better tabs on things but I usually trust things not to just lie to me. It&#x27;s pretty opaque.<p>2) The error you get when the beta expires makes no mention of the fact that the beta expired. Without judicious twitter searches and a quick look on hacker news, I didn&#x27;t know what the source of the error was and assumed something was wrong w/ apple&#x27;s activation or that someone had compromised my account in some way.",1381031867

Also, rumors are Apple may announce/release the Haswell 13&quot; MacBook Pro during their October announcement.  If so, many opinions seem to be that it may hit a sweet spot.<p>P.S.  I also read somewhere that the Haswell ThinkPads are expected to really be north of 10 hours of battery life.  I don&#x27;t know about when you hang the 1080p display on one, go up to the i7 processor, or -- of course -- run the optional 720 discrete graphics support.<p>Another thing that matters to me about the ThinkPads --  present at least with the T430 I mentioned.  The palm rest is not &quot;ginormous&quot;, and the front edge is curved/bevelled plastic rather than a sharp metal edge.  For me, this makes an essential difference in typing/use comfort, especially when working on a work surface I can&#x27;t adjust to optimal height.

There is a reasonable argument buried in there, though (I think).  From a civil liberties point of view, it matters a lot more to convey to the public an understanding of who and why they&#x27;re targeting rather than how.  Here&#x27;s a hypothetical, admittedly contrived analogy:<p>We&#x27;ve all seen crime movies where the criminal calls the police from an unknown location to make their demands and state what horrible outcome will occur if their demands aren&#x27;t met.  They&#x27;re using the communication method to hide their location and (sometimes) identity.  The police immediately flip on their call tracing device which starts counting down the time it takes to identify the caller&#x27;s location.  The criminal mastermind always hangs up with 2 seconds left on the clock because he knows it takes exactly N seconds to trace the call, for whichever value of N the scriptwriter chose.  Fast forward a few years and our hypothetical police department now has access to technology that allows them to trace calls phone calls instantly.  Until the criminals find out about it, they&#x27;ll continue to call in and make their demands, giving away their location and enabling the protagonist to jump in and save the hostage or defuse the bomb or whatever.  When the knowledge becomes widespread that phone calls are instantly traceable, the criminals start conveying their demands through some other non-traceable means.  The advantage moves from the side working to protect the public over to the side working to harm it.<p>The only people it would benefit to have outside knowledge of this technology are the ones being targeted by it.  It doesn&#x27;t matter to general public how the police are getting their information, only that it&#x27;s being used solely against legitimate targets.  What the public needs to know is that independent review is being conducted to ensure the technology isn&#x27;t abused and turned against them, and to be immediately informed if it ever is.  Showing the public the police department&#x27;s sources and methods in my hypothetical example had the net effect of making the public less safe.  In real life, if it turns out that the NSA is establishing a huge Orwellian surveillance network for nefarious purposes then the public needs to see real examples - politicians being blackmailed, backdoor financial manipulation, ordinary people being threatened and coerced, etc.  That would enable the public to stand up and take action against the NSA; if the public can&#x27;t get their elected government officials to stop overt abuse, that&#x27;s when a leak of sources and methods would be justified so that the public can protect itself.  If it turns out that the NSA has been using its technology to collect against legitimate foreign intelligence targets, then the public hasn&#x27;t benefitted at all from finding out how the NSA collects against its targets.<p>Personally, I prefer the solution mentioned recently on the EFF website [1] - establish independent oversight panels with both the legal and technical expertise to identify abuse and either stop it or notify the public.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/47-prominent-technologists-nsa-review-panel-we-need-better-technical-oversight"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/10/47-prominent-technolog...</a>",1381029082

But the only way to prevent this (besides coming up with objective measures for ADHD involving fMRI scans, like they&#x27;ve done for depression) would be to only prescribe neuroaffective medications to people whose lives take such a bad turn that they end up talking to a psychiatrist involuntarily (i.e. in a mental ward), thus preventing anyone who is self-aware-enough to notice that they have a problem from solving it.",1381028640

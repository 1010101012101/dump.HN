You are correct I use the large OO langs, and I agree that IDEs are only really useful for languages with strict types, large class libraries and large projects (so for example C++, and the JVM and .NET languages).<p>> write code, format code, run tests, run program<p>But isn&#x27;t there a frustrating number of unnecessary roundtrips involved here? At least in go, which is strictly typed, if you misspell a type or function name, when will you notice? Can you configure Sublime so that you at least get compiler support (so a typo will be noticed when you make it rather than later?).
And can you make sublime help you with displaying documentation hints or with completing statements? If you have a compiler error, how do you navigate to where it is? Do you have to read the line number in the compiler output and then open the offending file/tab in Sublime and navigate manually to the line? At least for most langs in Emacs you get compiler message parsing so you can jump straight to the problem.<p>Coming from the IDE world, I&#x27;d just never get off the ground with a new language if I had to go from autocompletion and squigglies under typos, to having to remember type names and function names in my head (yes IDEs have basically done that to my head, I can no longer remember even the smallest bit of language trivia).",1423227268

I think most people feel this way at points in their lives.<p><i>> you&#x27;re a worthy human being and don&#x27;t need to seek approval</i><p>This is a significant point.

The more relaxed attitude to things not working out as desired will reduce any air of desperation you might be giving off which will help you be more comfortable to be around.<p><i>> > I also feel resistance when I ask someone to go out on outings</i><p>There could be many reasons for this. People have limited time, especially those with GF&#x27;s/wives and families. Adding new people to their social circle may just seem like something they don&#x27;t have time for right now, and if that is the case it isn&#x27;t a slight against you personally.<p>It may also be that what you are suggesting just isn&#x27;t their thing. Have you tried finding like minded people outside your current family and work circles? If you have hobbies then finding a local club relating to one of them is a good way to meet people with whom you more naturally have something to talk about.<p><i>> Insecure men also struggle with their manliness.</i><p>I didn&#x27;t read a specific &quot;manliness&quot; issue here, but rather a more general &quot;socially awkward&quot; one. The rest of that paragraph are on point though: there are many in the same boat, many in far worse situations because they fell into something less than ideal, and finding the right people simple isn&#x27;t predictable. I say &quot;right <i>people</i>&quot; not &quot;right person&quot; there as I don&#x27;t believe there is <i>one</i> right person for <i>anyone</i> - there are a number of people you could love, a number of people who could love you, and there will be more people in the compatibility cross-over of that venn diagram than you might fear.<p><i>> > I still don&#x27;t have GF or wife</i><p>I suggest not worrying overly about that, if you try too hard to make it happen you&#x27;ll look desperate and either scare people off or attract the wrong sort who are out to take advantage. I&#x27;ve been single for a little over a decade now (initially burned by a long term relationship that went sour so I locked myself away a bit, more recently just because the right situations haven&#x27;t occurred (or when they have it hasn&#x27;t worked out)) and it really isn&#x27;t a problem. Concentrate on finding friends, if something else happens after that then that is a bonus. Heck, once you develop close friends they might introduce you to people they know who that might work for you with.<p>If you are specifically worried about that and feel it is something that is missing form your life you could try things like speed dating, I know a couple of people that has worked out well for. Everyone in the room knows they are in a similar position in the respect and the event is regimented which removes some of the awkwardness of approaching each other, and the worst that can happen is that you&#x27;ve lost a couple of hours of an evening and it might help you to go and realise the range of people who do turn up including people who you might otherwise assume could just walk into a bar and pull on command.<p><i>> > What is wrong with me, seriously ?</i><p>Almost certainly nothing more than is wrong with the rest of us!",1423226721

  contains the linear address specified with the memory
  operand from any level of the cache hierarchy in the
  cache coherence domain. The line may be retained in the
  cache hierarchy in non-modified state. Retaining the
  line in the cache hierarchy is a performance optimization
  (treated as a hint by hardware) to reduce the possibility
  of cache miss on a subsequent access. Hardware may
  choose to retain the line at any of the levels in the

The evaluation of whether competition successfully denotes success is limited to the scope of variables that the competition tests. If those variables cease to be indicative of success, then we have a lot of stuff that appears like it won the war, when in actuality it only won a very small subset of selective battles, much of what we only arbitrarily correlate to success (because without reproducing the conditions exactly, the data and information we can derive about the past is limited and/or subject to malleability).<p>We&#x27;ve evolved this far because we did. It&#x27;s survivor bias.<p>It is entirely likely that there exist good things that are adapted for everything they purport to be, aside from competitive environments. If competition is eliminated, we can at least begin to separate the variables that are a function of the competitive process, and the variables that denote skill.<p>It is not necessary that we leave the survival of culture and ideas up to the same primitive mechanisms that determine whether a fish with smaller gills reproduces in a shallow pool rather than a deeper one - and make the inference that because it does survive, that it was because of the depth of the pool, and not because of the lack of sharks. Just because it has worked so far does not mean it will continue to work. Competition can cause emotions to control direction rather than objectivity over the data as it exists.

And of course nobody would <i>ever</i> move such a machine and forget to tell the manufacturer that that&#x27;s what they did.<p>The strength of the web is a huge factor in machine precision (and repeatability, just as important) but what you don&#x27;t get out of that brochure is that just lifting and putting that machine back down again will put it seriously out of spec, the deformation incurred will require a complete recalibration. Dealing with dynamic loading is a different problem entirely.<p>We&#x27;re talking about machines where thermal compensation is considered a normal thing and where you compensate for toolwear.<p>Not all of these machines are owned outright (they can be very expensive), plenty of them are leased and lease companies just love it when a customer goes out of business and their expensive goods have grown legs and have walked off.<p>Anyway, DRM without valid reasons is a bad thing, but there are some reasons why not wanting to move machinery like this around without knowing about it is a good thing and you&#x27;ve provided no reason why it isn&#x27;t, obviously, you can petition the manufacturer to help assist in a move and re-calibration if required (nothing stops you from doing that in the present day), and your conclusion that the machines strength means it does not have to be calibrated is out of touch with reality as far as I&#x27;m aware of it.<p>Those unlock-codes are provided for free to the buyer of the machinery, and it isn&#x27;t even a given that they will always trigger for every kind of move. (But at a guess, if you simulated shipping one in a container I&#x27;m pretty sure that it will come out dead.)<p>FWIW I worked on the software of an older generation of machinery like this and have spent enough time watching teams calibrate them to have serious respect for how easy it is to knock a machine to &#x27;useless&#x27; territory.<p>As for the bad version of DRM: Mitutoyo had some equipment ending up in Iran contravening the US export ban (pretty weird that a Japanese company could be found in violation of a US export ban, but there are probably relevant details that I&#x27;m not aware of), so that&#x27;s where the DRM component comes in.<p>So if you really want to complain about that aspect then you should petition the government, not the CNC manufacturers.<p>But &quot;lock-down, unlock through mfg&quot; has other uses too.<p>(You could easily imagine that the Gyro software could be set up in such a way that if the change in location was minor that it would not cause a lock-down if the export restriction were the real concern here)<p>Which makes me wonder how these would fare during earthquakes.",1423224646

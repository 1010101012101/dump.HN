3439253,comment,3438677,3438909,2,0,introspectif,,,"I agree that the context switching costs are quite high, reducing the time actually spent on coding. It might be better to focus on one language/framework for five straight weeks, for example, while still changing specific design patterns/recipes per week. It reduces switching costs, gives devs time to grok new languages if need be, and should result in higher quality code for each weekly project.<p>You might also let devs post fragments of their code as they work on it, and links to their github repos. The reason is that a dev who is really learning a lot, not just exercising existing skills, might get far off track if working in isolation, like a plane that takes off at a heading that is slightly off, and ends up hundreds of kilometers from its target. Plus, it would give more time for people to discuss/debate alternate implementations, and that debate itself would also be a great source of learning.",1326016540

Few people really talk about inflow and outflow and flux-in-general, I think most just pick one particular issue and hammer at it until it goes their way. There's very little pro/con analysis among single issues, let alone pro/con analysis across the spectrum and over combinations of actions we might have the government do or not do. I'll charitably interpret your reply as saying that (clear AA benefits) - (clear AA harms) + (unforeseen AA plus/minus side-effects) > 0. I might even agree with that, but you've offered no argument for why that is since you likely think ""It's obvious"" and you've not done any exploration into the space of other possible side-effects or other ways of increasing black people's economic status.

This point is useless, the entire number 4 in your post. First of all, if you're using it as a point, you've never used a Windows Phone. It's as stable as an iPhone (certainly moreso than Android), I've had one since April and have never had a crash, lockup, or misplaced UI element. You seem to be bringing that from Windows Mobile, which is hands down the biggest thing holding Windows Phone back right now. Technical people who cannot and will not distinguish between it and its unrelated predecessor.<p>This argument pisses me off because it's completely unfounded, yet I constantly hear people saying ""Well, I have my doubts since it's a Microsoft product"" without ever using it.

If I advertise the job, I get thousands of people to choose from. Some of them will be handicapped. Let's say there is a goverment regulations, that employing the handicapped is duty-free, like cigarettes at the airports. Now I have two options. I either choose somebody who isn't duty-free, and pay 1572 (the empoyee still gets only 760), or, if I'm LUCKY, I will find a somebody suitable for the job among the handicapped persons, and I can choose him or her for the job. That way I've cut my employment costs two half, without paying ANY taxes. It's a nobrainer, even if I have to make some changes in my office to accomodate it for the duty-free person. Because I can slash my employment costs into half on the long run, without paying 1 cent less Salary than to everybody else. And the state? It's a win-win-win.

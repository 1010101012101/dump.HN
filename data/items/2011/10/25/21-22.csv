For the past couple of months, I've been using a tiny webserver I've dubbed draughtsman to kick up my productivity while doing HTML prototypes. It's a node.js app that provides you with  transparent compilation of CoffeeScript, Stylus, Jade, HAML et cetera. And directory listings (yeah, baby!) Probably more useful for designers than for devs. It's sort of like Apache/mod_php... but for people who know better than to use PHP (I kid, I kid). MIT licensed.<p>I do a lot of front-end prototypes for apps and websites I may or may not want to keep on building, and because of the throwaway quality of those things I don't want to be bothered with keeping all sorts of autocompiling scripts running for CoffeeScript, SASS et cetera, and I also don't want to start a Rails or Django project (yes, I use both) just for the sake of having transparent precompilation of those assets, and I also don't want to limit myself to writing plain HTML and CSS.<p>A bit more information over here: <a href=""http://stdout.be/2011/10/25/draughtsman/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stdout.be/2011/10/25/draughtsman/</a><p>It's maybe a couple hundred lines of code, so easy to read through if that's your thing.<p>Just scratching my own itch here, but I'm curious to see what you guys think.",1319579966

3156047,comment,3154844,3155965,4,0,RickHull,,,"Implementation choices have costs and benefits.  One cost of the original MRI (Matz Ruby Interpreter) is that it used ""green threads"" that could only be scheduled within the process (running on a single CPU) and not across CPUs.  Another is that it was written in C, and some of C's semantics and implementation choices bubbled up into artifice that the Ruby user needs to know and care about.  As well, the performance of MRI, due to some early design choices, has some limitations.<p>An implementation of Ruby on a new platform, JVM in this case, allows new choices to be made, involves a different set of tradeoffs, etc.  RAM usage, startup time, JIT features, etc -- these are all factors.",1319579731

But I think when you say ""the best hope for PHP..."", you might be forgetting that not every project using PHP is a big application. I think Rails would be overkill for a smaller project (for example, an informational website for a small business), and so would Symfony (which the author of the linked article says himself). I bet a majority of the usage of PHP out there is for much smaller tasks that might benefit a little bit from a framework (or at least a separation of concerns), but would not be worth switching to a different language and platform (not to mention the deployment piece of the puzzle).",1319578306

From everything I've heard about the guy, he was a totally different man at Pixar.<p>When Jobs started Apple, he was young and very unpolished in his interpersonal style. When he re-joined it the culture had become something that he wasn't entirely responsible for, having been out of the company for over a decade. Also, the impression I've had of Jobs is that he was very harsh on VPs (whose high salaries and job status justify the difficulty) but not on lower-level employees.<p>That said, the worst thing about Steve Jobs isn't the man himself. It's the Fake Steve Jobs's out there. No, I don't mean the parody blogger. I mean the two-bit clowns who think that being ""visionary"" gives them the right to behave like complete assholes because that's what they understand Jobs's management style (I've never worked for him) to be.<p>There was a lot of good to Steve Jobs, and apparently a lot about him that was difficult. A lot of people assume they have the good and that it allows them to be difficult. That's toxic.<p>The ""fake Steve"" (he actually cited Steve Jobs to justify his personal shortcomings) whom I encountered was an ""entrepreneur"" who lied (to his angel investor and employees) for over 3 years to keep people in his company. I left when I got tired of the insanity, micromanagement, and dishonesty, but I lost a hell of a lot of time there.",1319578268

Jobs may well (a) have been a jerk in a way that would normally make someone ineffective as a manager, and (b) have had other qualities that compensated for that; and maybe (c) the latter qualities were extremely rare.

But wouldn't you agree that this is offset by the number of times you have to empathize with people and be their friend?  After all, a <i>complete</i> asshole gets neither respect nor friendship.  And a lot of the people who work for the asshole boss will probably take your advice and quit.  What good is a boss without workers?<p><i>Other bosses probably make good bosses for other personality types.</i><p>I disagree.  If an organization is a round hole, the only person who benefits is the round peg who built it (if <i>anyone</i> benefits).

Just because everyone and their mother uses it is no justification for law enforcement to use it as well</i><p>Yes there is; if private citizens have access routine  to technology that law enforcement is barred from using, then you'll have situations where there is photographic evidence of criminality that police are unable to act on (a popular example lately: webcams on laptops being used to ID thieves). If the police can't or won't act on it, while the recognition technology is freely available to web service users, then you're quickly heading for vigilantism and a lack of confidence in law enforcement.<p>Vigilantism has a poor record in dispensing justice as it has no procedural safeguards or judicial review whatsoever. Historical records show that prior to the establishment of professional police forces, rates of murder and other violent crimes were considerably higher. State-run police forces are what we got after market solutions had failed.<p>David D Friedman has studied libertarian approaches to law enforcement in some depth, and points out various shortcomings as well as some apparent benefits: <a href=""http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/England_18thc./England_18thc.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/England_18thc./Englan...</a>",1319576989

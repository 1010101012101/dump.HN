Then I show them the code for that window.  Then I show them how to modify different components by adjusting variables and so on, so that they get the feel for where all the moving parts are and see how their changes directly affect the popup window.<p>Then, I have them write a basic function that does the same thing, but this time from scratch.  Once we go over what worked and didn't and debug the code and get things working, we move on to a second function or construct.<p>Ultimately, the goal is to start small and continue expanding from there, kind of like having the trainee drive around a parking lot, then city streets, then the freeway.<p>Most importantly, I find that the key is to keep building on the same code, and helping the trainee see their program grow into something useful -- as opposed to simply showing them one construct in the abstract and then another and then another, without tying them together in any way.",1216749107

That was the first time that I heard Scoble speak in person and I remember telling myself that this had to be the beginning of the end for Podtech.  This is not meant to be a negative on Scoble or John (who had a vision that involves Scoble).  But I was thinking that if Podtech were to be a media company (which it wasn't until hiring Scoble and other ""superstar"") then not only does it need to be authentic (which Scoble certainly was and still is) but it had to be relevant as well (to its growing population of free subscribers and more importantly to its paid customers).  I was not convinced that Scoble was ""sustainably""  relevant to increase listener base beyond a small niche (which is a big problem for a VC-backed startup since they expect huge payback).   Soon after that I decided to unsubscribe Podtech altogether because a listener, I was confused.  Podtech as a media company did not have a unique genre and the contents were all over the place (too much talents, may be, to put it mercifully).",1216748527

Something as innocuous as StreamFile will certainly be used to unauthorizedly distribute copyrighted content, but that is the responsibility of the uploader, not the service provider.<p>One of the few reasonable aspects of the DMCA is the approach to ""Safe Harbor"" provisions.

The test was not measuring test-taking strategy - it may not even have been scored in a student-visible way. In the absence of a score-optimizing approach the natural inclination of the student's analytic style should come to the forefront.

Bringing vision theory into CS boils down to converting continuous space into discrete space. This led to a great quote from the prof ""CS people are engineering who think discretely"".  I think this article reflects this mentality.  Being ""good"" at CS involves making a consistent state model where events always follow other events.

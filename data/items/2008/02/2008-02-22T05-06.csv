121092,comment,120857,120857,0,0,henning,,,"Just the other day I had to use a non-trivial string algorithm for some batch string searching (searching for occurrences of any of a few million different strings on a large text corpus). A colleague is working on creating a little language for doing batch image processing, requiring use of undergrad-level compilers material.<p>As for the string problem I faced, I found an existing implementation in the language I was using, but I wound up having to modify it in order to cope with changing requirements.<p>If I hadn't learned about algorithms and automata in college, it probably would have been impossible for me to understand what I was using and I'd be flying blind. I probably would have instead not even known about the algorithm and would have believed that an inefficient naive solution was the only way, therefore making the project essentially infeasible (at first glance, anyway).<p>I'm also thankful that I had the opportunity to learn about functional programming because it made me a better programmer in imperative languages.",1203659640
121091,comment,120857,120857,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I should be finishing my degree this summer, and I knew going into the program that I wanted to be doing web startups when I was done.  So, I chose a program the focused more on Software Engineering than straight CS.<p>So, tailored my education along the lines of creating startups.  My classes the last 2 years have included Intro to Database systems, Unix programming, Perl, Web Database Programming, Advanced Database systems, Distributed Systems, and Systems Programming.  I've avoided Java and Microsoft technologies whenever I've been able to.<p>Every time that I get a semester break, I work on learning Django, or Ruby on Rails, and every semester web development comes a little easier to me.  I've also been doggedly pursuing my own education, and I'm not relying on my school to give it to me on a silver platter.  School is there to give you a framework, on which you continue your self-education.  So, when I was taking my Distributed systems class, I read up on Erlang, and the other students had no idea what that language was for.<p>There are people in my advanced database classes that are editing SQL with notepad on windows.  I was trying to tell them that a decent text-editor might improve their quality of life a little bit.  Several of them didn't know what the difference between notepad and a decent text editor was.  Sigh...  I guess that it goes to show that it's not the school, it's the student.",1203659528
121090,comment,120857,120960,0,0,Spyckie,,,"The most useful thing I've learned in CS is to define and keep stringent rules while programming. These can be time/space constraints, programming time constraints, keeping the code modular, readable, or reusable, etc. Define rules that make the most sense for the project you have to do and write code with these rules in mind regardless of your own personal coding preferences. All CS knowledge learned enables you to keep to these rules.
Of course, good rules to follow can be 'learn as much as possible' or 'enjoy yourself', but when it comes down to building something, enjoying yourself doesn't mean you've written good code.",1203659357

It includes more of his Wii remote projects -- including his interactive whiteboard which I think is even more interesting -- and it includes a link to his academic pursuits.<p>Following the ""Academics"" link, you'll find that his thesis project is ""Projector-Based Location Discovery and Tracking"", which takes his whiteboard hobby a couple of steps further.",1203659153

And, that might account for the difference in perspective.<p>In many parts of the country, $15 an hour is seen as really good money for unskilled labor.  But, in Silicon Valley, $15 an hour is well below the poverty line.  I'm sure that works its way up the economic ladder as well.  If a moving company owner can make $60-100k a year, in many parts of the country, that's considered rather wealthy.  In Silicon Valley, that would probably be a lower middle class income.<p>Where my in-laws live, in Toledo, Ohio, there are <i>tons</i> of talented artists and musicians.  But while there is a great supply, and no demand from wealthy music lovers to support them.  So, while a relative plays in a Jazz band every weekend and packs out the club, he has to keep his day job as a small engine mechanic.  The clubs just don't pay enough.  It's not that people don't like his music.  It's that there is no money in that part of the country for skills.  It's a lot harder to pay musicians when you're charging $2 for a beer instead of $8 for a mixed drink, or $120 for dinner and drinks for two at Yoshi's in San Francisco.<p>I'm assuming that if he move to the Bay area, where there is a lot more demand for Jazz, he might be able to make a decent living by playing clubs.<p>Just my $.02",1203658092

I would embark on a census of all the geniuses who did <i>not</i> go insane, but this post is too short to contain it. I will, however, not miss the opportunity to re-quote the first line of Goodstein's <i>States of Matter</i>, IMHO the most hilarious line in physics-education history:<p><i>Ludwig Boltzmann, who spend much of his life studying statistical mechanics, died in 1906 by his own hand. Paul Ehrenfest, carrying on his work, died similarly in 1933. Now it is our turn to study statistical mechanics.</i><p>Fortunately, most of us survived stat mech.<p>Finally, while one can obviously dispute the cause of Turing's death, and claim that it might have had something to do with his ""genius"", it might also have had <i>something</i> to do with the public humiliation, the removal of his security clearance (and thereby, effectively, his career in cryptography), and the disfiguring hormonal treatments that were forced on him by a homophobic society. I mean, you can see how that might have been kind of depressing.",1203656551

I don&#x27;t find any deficiency in &#x27;cd&#x27;. None, whatsoever. &quot;Goto&quot; just adds a couple of more features on top of it. That&#x27;s it.  I wanted to replicate Sublime Texts fuzzy-finder, I added a bookmark/shortcut thingy just for the sake of it(..you know more features. ) It helps me traverse between directories and that&#x27;s that, dude.. Dunno about zsh, fish etc etc. No idea about auto-completes. I made it. Found it useful, wanted people to review it. It was fun, got to learn some more stuff. That&#x27;s that.

The bad is that they all suffer from the windows mindset and spend a great deal of time building for windows.

8997547,comment,8996024,8996024,0,0,Bjorkbat,,,"The comments are amusing.  It seems there&#x27;s a popular opinion that to be an engineer requires a higher understanding of mathematics than what most mere mortals require.<p>My understanding was that to call yourself an engineer one must be capable of building robust and efficient things, whether that thing is a plane, or a bridge, complex software, even a website, matters not, so long as it is robust and efficient.<p>The degree to which you understand mathematics is useful only in how greatly it can enable you to build something robust and efficient.  Thus, if you know more linear algebra than 90% of all mere mortals, but write inefficient programs, then at best you are a bad Software Engineer, at worst you&#x27;re simply not a Software Engineer.<p>For that reason, at my current job I was asked to replace a man who earned his PhD in Computer Science from Georgia Tech who&#x27;s job was to build an maintain an API in Go, despite the fact that I&#x27;m a college dropout.  Smart man, with a far better understanding of mathematics, but ultimately I could build things more robustly and efficiently.  I had stronger engineering skills.<p>Going back to OP, right on man.  I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy math until I learned it using my own rules, by own rules I mean I shunned the established method of repetition until you memorized the process, instead opting to understand the underlying concept and keep my thoughts written away somewhere for future reference, knowing all too well by now that memorization is futile given how frequently I have to reference Stack Overflow.",1423065531

Chaos reoriented priorities across starts and fits with mathematics in post-secondary education.<p>I enrolled in Coursera&#x27;s <i>Discreet Optimization</i> about a year ago. It was way beyond my ability [No SoA], but I learned a hell of a lot about computing and solving hard computational problems. It also suggested  that mathematics might be important when grappling interesting problems.<p>For fun I watched a number of Strang&#x27;s Open-Courseware videos on matrices. I hit Chapter 1 of <i>TAoCP</i>. I treated it like programming - it was ok to only partially understand. I took an Algorithms MOOC or two. I actually enjoyed following the analysis even formal analysis is not something I would do for pleasure.<p>The turning point though was when Lamport&#x27;s &quot;Thinking for Programmers&quot; [Lamport: Thinking] hit HN. It threw down the gauntlet. Specification is a prerequisite for a commitment to getting it right, where the it is computing. And when the it is computing, we are talking about math whether we like it or not.<p>It&#x27;s not that the math and specification replaces testing.

I feel Nadella is taking a &quot;cheaper, faster&quot; approach which is fine and dandy in the otherwise non-critical mobile space (mobile users are used to being treated like crap and having buggy releases) but in enterprise there&#x27;s simply a higher standard of quality.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this means for MS. At our shop we now have to overly-test all patches and then wait a minimum of 30 days to see what happens.  This has saved our bacon several times under Nadella&#x27;s MS when before we only had to do pretty casual testing of patches.  This also means a lot of shops are no longer rushing to get security patches in because of his negligence and corner cutting.  That means a less secure internet for all.<p>I really wish someone would step in and show Nadella that MS shouldnt just be an Apple-lite and that catering to enterprise should be MS&#x27;s main goal, especially considering that&#x27;s where almost all its revenue comes from. I&#x27;m sure playing Steve Jobs-lite is fun for Nadella, but its about time he grew up and started running with the big dogs. Frankly, I&#x27;m sick of the focus on mobile and other popular technology taking away from the core competencies that made some of these companies great. The recent actions and changes on OSX are disheartening as well. Or how the steam behind the Chromebook is more or less dead as Android eats the world.<p>Buying and updating an MS product shouldn&#x27;t be a gamble. They&#x27;re supposed to be the conservative and stable big brother to the industry.  Ironically, its only now under new leadership that we have so much more incentive to move to FOSS products. Its the same amount of headaches, except with FOSS I have no licensing worries. Under Gates and Balmer, the commercial MS products were less headaches and delivered a fair amount of value.  Now just installing an Exchange rollup is asking for a complete reimaging.  We don&#x27;t even bother with service packs anymore. Might as well roll out a new image with that cooked in. The fail rate on those is unacceptably high.<p>edit: why the downvotes? this echoes the sentiment at places like stackexchange and /r/sysadmin.  testing at MS has gone to hell and everyone knows it.  burying my comment does nothing to stop that reality. Its well known Nadella personally redid the QA and testing parts of MS and those outcomes have only gotten worse.",1423064417

In a sense, New Hampshire state government looks a lot more like city-level or county-level government in many other states.<p>Compared to other states, state representatives are far more likely to &quot;average citizens&quot; instead of career politicians - just everyday people who have decided to do as single term in state government, and have little to no plans to run again. This is very frustrating for the leadership of both chambers, since it makes it very difficult to whip votes! On the other hand, it arguably makes it easier for elected officials to buck party lines and vote their conscience, if they so choose.<p>In addition New Hampshire does not (last I checked) have direct-vote ballot initiatives the way California does, but it does make it much easier for citizens to propose legislation. Whether or not this legislation gains traction or actually passes is a separate matter. Look no further than the long history of repeated attempts at marijuana policy reform in NH to see just how difficult it can be to predict which bills will end up gaining traction[0].<p>As a result, it&#x27;s very common to see bills that are proposed and supported by a small contingent of backers, but never end up going anywhere. This bill may or may not end up passing, but just keep this context in mind whenever you read news about a bill being brought to the NH legislature with only a handful of supporters.<p>[0] This issue is actually a particularly fascinating case study in NH government, because NH is a very libertarian-leaning state, and it baffled reform advocates for the longest time that they had such difficulty in getting NH to pass relatively uncontroversial reform measures.",1423063771

You really need an application-wide DI system like Angular/Ember to get this working with multiple requests in parallel.<p>2: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989667"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989667</a><p>I&#x27;m really really really excited about this work because I think we can have a single, robust solution for all Ember developers that is dead simple to install and get running. Most importantly, this makes JavaScript apps accessible for everyone, while retaining the UI advantages for those whose devices are capable enough. In other words, I think once this is complete, we can finally put to bed the controversy over whether server-side or client-side rendering is best—we&#x27;ll have a hybrid that offers the best of both worlds.",1423063639

US Dollars, Euros, gold would all be a valid numeraire to use when reporting your current assets and income to the IRS. And the currency you choose to report your taxes in, is the currency you pay taxes in.<p>This is just currency competition. Nothing more than that. The ability to freely choose which currency you want to use to measure value.<p>Whether bitcoin should be considered alongside dollars, yen and silver is an open question. If people are allowed to report their taxes in bitcoins, they can really shoot themselves in the foot. But, personally, I&#x27;m generally speaking not in favor of the government preventing people from shooting themselves in the foot.<p>Say, for example, I choose to report my taxes in bitcoins. I currently hold 10 bitcoins and $1,000. Later, the price of bitcoins in dollars (BTCUSD) falls from 225 to 50. This means that one dollar is now worth 1/50 bitcoin instead of 1/225 bitcoin. I then buy 20 bitcoins using the $1,000, and -- because I report my taxes in bitcoins -- it means I&#x27;ve realized a capital gain of ($1,000×(1/50) - $1,000×(1/225)) = 20 BTC - 4.4444 BTC = 15.5556 BTC, on which I pay capital gains tax. The <i>bitcoin value</i> of my dollars has increased (before 1/225 bitcoin per dollar, now 1/50 bitcoin per dollar), so I have to pay bitcoins to the IRS if I convert dollars into bitcoins, after the bitcoin price falls.<p>This just shows that bitcoin really isn&#x27;t ready to be used as proper money. Proper money is a money you would report your taxes in. Bitcoin just isn&#x27;t stable enough in value yet.",1423063588

The fact I really enjoyed comic books didn&#x27;t help my perception either. Just take a look for yourself and the way the Super Hero bodytype looks like. Straight up juiced[1].<p>Then, I started natural using a book from the library. Weightlifting actually helped manage a lot of my physical handicap - by being stronger, I was reducing the wear and tear on my body. Well, because I still wanted to break through to another level, I started researching supplements. Using the mind to grow the body.<p>Protein, Glutamine, BCAAs, Tribulus, ZMA - all of them are natural ways to increase physical strength and also grow into a lean, muscular person. They were good, and eventually I found my way to some PH products. If 19-Norandro was good enough for Mark McGwire (it wasn&#x27;t he was on the real stuff, that was just a cover story), then I was game to try it! Worked great, enjoyed it but also knew that doing so over a long period of time would have side effects. Eventually 19-Norandro got banned. There are chemists doing great work in the field (I&#x27;ve got my eye on one vendor in particular), and they&#x27;ll always be 1 step ahead of the law, IMO.<p>I did a couple more different products but never stacked to the point where I&#x27;d need PCT. Honestly, I think budget and liver damage fears were my driving motives. Just look at Arnold - he had to have heart surgery, and I&#x27;d bet a lot of money it&#x27;s related to the muscle being exposed to years of heavy steroid doses[2].<p>These days I avoid PH or the juice outright. As I age, I might get back into the scene, but it&#x27;s a crap shoot. There are far, far too many placebo type products out there, and the really good stuff has side effects that must be planned for, otherwise the whole quality of life part goes down, and where&#x27;s the fun in that?<p>Overall, I&#x27;d say TRT/PH/Juice are definitely not for everybody, but they&#x27;re not inherently evil. Sort of like alcohol. Not everybody can knock back a dozen beers during a weekend marathon session at home and still be productive / nice / etc, but it&#x27;s possible depending on the individual.<p>[1] Freshman year of University the next door neighbor was a Pre-Med, about 5&#x27;2&quot; and 205 lbs. We became pals and he let me in on the steroid secrets (cycling, GHB for sleep, etc). We did have a good laugh talking about how comic book characters reflected different steroids: Want to be Captain America? Deca. Wolverine? Winstrol. Sabretooth? Deca + Winstrol!

Oddly enough, it wasn&#x27;t until I threw myself into more advanced mathematics that I started to see the fun in it. I absolutely hated learning calculus and linear algebra even though I could do it well. It just seemed so boring. I don&#x27;t have a good solution to how to make things better, however, the mathematician Paul Lockhart has given this a lot of thought.<p>All that said, I think there are a number of misconceptions here.<p>First, mathematicians invent new languages all the time. That&#x27;s the point of definitions, otherwise we&#x27;d be using sets to describe everything. The problem is, you first have to understand the concept well in order to apply suitable definitions. Think probability before Kolmogorov.<p>Second, Turing machines are a formalism to introduce you to the theory of computation because they are the simplest (or close to it) thing that can compute in the current sense of the word. Once you learn how TMs work, pretty much everyone just accepts them as a given and deals at a higher level.<p>Third people are trying to read Mochizuki&#x27;s proof, but it is very hard. He basically invented his own way of doing things and so to understand his proof you first need to understand his methods. It&#x27;s understandable that professional mathematicians with their own careers and areas of research find it hard to read the ~1000 pages of dense mathematics (proof + prior papers) to understand what is going on. Most people probably haven&#x27;t read 1000 pages of math in their life, and it takes a while to come to terms with it no matter how smart you are.",1423062780

But that&#x27;s a tough row to hoe, given that there is physical evidence connecting Ulbricht as well.<p>There&#x27;s no evidence of manufacturing or tampering with evidence. The argument that the defense is relying on is that the evidence is so overwhelming, so spectacularly damning, that nobody with the ability to run a vast criminal conspiracy could simultaneously be so reckless and naive as to leave that much evidence.<p>Two additional points the defense was going to attempt before being shut down by the court:<p>* They were going to put a bitcoin expert on the stand to testify as to the unlikelihood of someone actually being able to transfer as much bitcoin from Silk Road to Ulbricht&#x27;s wallet as the FBI actually found. Possibly --- it is part of the defense&#x27;s strategy to surprise the prosecution with new arguments --- they&#x27;d also find some way to testify as to ways in which bitcoin wallets can be tampered with or manufactured.<p>Nick Weaver at ISCI independently tracked SR transactions to what&#x27;s believed to be Ulbricht&#x27;s wallet, and was able to almost immediately trace 20% of the funds in that wallet directly to Silk Road. This was going to be a longshot argument, but it&#x27;s an argument in the vein you&#x27;re referring to.<p>* They were going to put Steve Bellovin on the stand to testify as to how vulnerabilities in BitTorrent clients could have allowed hackers to put arbitrary files on Ulbricht&#x27;s laptop, thus explaining away all the evidence the FBI found on it. At the time he was apprehended, Ulbricht was running a BitTorrent client downloading a Colbert episode.<p>That&#x27;s about it. That, and the old lady he grew up with who said he was a nice boy. Really.<p>Against the notion that hackers digitally framed Ulbricht are things like the slips of paper they found with SR details on them alongside his girlfriend&#x27;s phone number, or the USB fob backup of SR they found on his nightstand.<p>Everyone feels like they&#x27;ve missed something here, or that they haven&#x27;t been following along carefully, because the defense put on an absurdly short slate of witnesses who primarily testified to Ulbricht&#x27;s character. The court chided them for attempting to put on a case through the prosecution&#x27;s witnesses rather than calling their own. Even when the defense tried to do that, it did so outlandishly; for instance, their accusation that Karpeles was behind Ulbricht&#x27;s framing fell apart dramatically when it was revealed that Ulbricht had paid the hosting bills for the Silk Road website parked at Karpeles hosting company.<p>It&#x27;s just a weird, weird case, is what I&#x27;m saying.",1423062519

This is/was a legal requirement, irrespective of the consent of Afganistan.  The reason the US did the lawful thing Afganistan  and not Yemen, is due to a poor (self-serving) legal interpretation, where the US does not consider what it did in Yemen of international character but the US could not make the same argument for Afganistan.  Essentially the US claims (in a legal sense) it can kill its own citizens anywhere in the world without international law applying because US believes such action is domestic in nature.  In other words the US is not making your argument, that they can use force wherever a foreign nation consents, the US&#x27; position is that the can use force anywhere in the world (with or without consent) so long as the force is used against its own citizens.",1423062393

8997127,comment,8996024,8997024,0,0,vdnkh,,,"Right, I understand your point. I said in an earlier post that an engineer is one who obtains an engineering degree from a certified university. I realize that it&#x27;s pedantic and elitist, and there&#x27;s definitely a part of me who thinks it&#x27;s idiotic. Because it is. It&#x27;s a title, who cares right? It doesn&#x27;t lessen the worth of my degree. I&#x27;ve been trying to come up with valid reasons for why it&#x27;s important for only people who fit my definition to be called an engineer but I can&#x27;t think of any. So you&#x27;re right.<p>However, I still think it&#x27;s wrong for people who don&#x27;t exhibit these qualities to call themselves an engineer. If you make sick beats on your macbook, that&#x27;s great. But don&#x27;t call yourself a beat mix engineer.<p>Edit: Thought of some reasons
It&#x27;s similar to the &quot;doctor&quot; title. You can be the worlds greatest doctor. Self-taught, you can do everything from intubation to surgery. However, you&#x27;re still not a doctor. You practice medicine. Why? There&#x27;s things that you can only learn from someone who is more skilled than you, and who is skilled at teaching. That&#x27;s what a professor is (simple definition). They are an authority on their topic and are the best place to learn from. They teach things that books don&#x27;t cover. They have experience. They can tell you when you&#x27;re wrong, and unlike a book can teach you the most current standards and techniques.<p>Another point is the completeness of education. Your coworker, does he know vector calculus? Linear algebra? The forward-active voltage for a BJT? Maybe. But there&#x27;s no guarantee he does. A degree from a certified university guarantees that you know the salient points of your field (not always true, but for my argument it is). If you don&#x27;t have a degree, there&#x27;s no guarantee. And this knowledge is important.",1423062293

Pomodoro technique to get through tasks.<p>Since I have a very fluid schedule, I designed the new habits as small &quot;chunks of time&quot; around my only daily constants: breackfast, lunch and dinner.

However, I remember the key points, and I&#x27;ll surmise them here:<p>- The A-10&#x27;s survivability is overrated. The Air Force conducted studies after both Gulf Wars and found that the A-10 was taking higher damage per sortie when compared in &#x27;91 to &#x27;03. That Iraq&#x27;s air defense was in shambles didn&#x27;t seem to diminish the fact that the A-10 was becoming more vulnerable to more sophisticated weapons. Technology has made cheaper weapons more effective since the 1970s in which this was designed. In a higher threat environment, the lack of sophisticated sensors, threat identification, and ECM is seen as not boding well.<p>- The A-29 is a fantastic plane. But it&#x27;s giving the A-10 a run for it&#x27;s money, not the F-35. In the low-threat COIN environment, it has all of the benefits of the A-10 with none of the drawbacks. That famous cannon isn&#x27;t always idea against militants in the mountains when you&#x27;re worried about spraying your own troops. That the A-19 can carry small guided weapons just like the A-10 gives it capabilities where it counts. And it&#x27;s half to a third of the price to purchase and maintain.<p>So the A-10 is getting squashed from two sides: The F-35 can penetrate the high-threat environment, and provide CAS in a lethal SAM environment, while the A-29 can provide CAS/COIN against militants in a low to non-existent threat environment. There is no middle ground. It left when air defense systems gained the sophisticated tracking and accuracy that wasn&#x27;t there in the 1970s and 80s.<p>The A-10 was a fantastic plane and well designed for the time in which it was envisioned to fight. But even I agree that it&#x27;s time has passed. Like the F-14, it&#x27;s sad to see it go, but I think it&#x27;s the right call.",1442822075

You haven&#x27;t mentioned your visa situation, but given that you said you can stay for 6 months I&#x27;m going to assume you are on a B2 visa.<p>When you arrive in the US, be ready to explain why you are NOT planning on moving here or finding a job. You aren&#x27;t coming to SF to look for work, you&#x27;re coming as a TOURIST and are going to see some sights, and then head home. Also, the longer you say you are going to stay in the US, the harder they will grill you. I would even suggest booking a refundable/changeable return flight a few weeks after you land, and say you are only going to stay for a few weeks. You can always &quot;change your mind&quot; after you get here, because they will almost always stamp you for 6 months in your passport regardless of how long you say you want to stay.<p>Remember: it&#x27;s against the tourist visa rules to even THINK about working here or look for a job. So do not mention anything about looking for work, or wanting to live in SF, or even that one day you would like to live here. As far as they should know you love your home country and can&#x27;t wait to get back there. It also helps if you own property or have dependent family in your home country (this gives you a reason preventing you from illegally immigrating). Failing this, get a letter from an employer saying that you have been granted x weeks vacation and will be expected back at work on a particular date.<p>If you haven&#x27;t applied for the visa yet, then get your story straight, and everything above applies x10 for the visa interview.<p>Take it from someone who learned all this the hard way :)<p>Now, with that out of the way I would love to meet up when you get here.

Nor it will block Facebook ads, YouTube Ads or some in-app marketing.<p>So, what I think is missing in the discussion that, perhaps by flaw or mistake, but the original sin of the web (ads) is now the currency for many websites, apps, etc... and it maintains the small, medium and large publishers and companies.<p>Ad blocking as-now targets the independent web more than anything. It will force Advertisers to give to Google/Facebook/Apple more and basically just suck the revenues of an industry into the hands of a handful of platform. Content has already been centralized by force, now they want the ads as well.<p>People who say, &#x27;if your content requires ads then its not worth it, or you are in the wrong side of history, blah, blah, blah&#x27; fail to recognize how ad monetization happens on web/apps - yes it gets annoying, but it works. Independent sites (arts, news, etc...) like a favorite of mine ArsTechnica, depend on Ad revenue.<p>Apple releasing Ad Blockers the same day their News app becomes permanent and with Ads that cannot be blocked its not a coincidence. And that is quite a strategic move aimed to move more ad revenue into fewer companies. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the right side of history then. I hope not.<p>However, it&#x27;s all in the defaults - 90% of online users (and I cant imagine app users are any higher) never touch the defaults. Sure, a number of 20MM may have downloaded adblockers online, but it is still small. But once the option is there, one day, the iPhone7 might default to &#x27;ad block yes&#x27; and obliterate a mobile ad industry. No one likes to defend marketers, but moving us to a system controlled by a few platforms is a bad idea. Say, a presidential election could be influenced by a company deciding it won&#x27;t allow ads of candidate Y or Z etc... or Donation campaigns won&#x27;t be able to afford a market price of higher ad prices.<p>This is a bad idea folks.",1442821119

10250853,comment,10250371,10250590,0,0,tragic,,,"> Edit: To clarify why I find it is distasteful — In context of recent events this is just a poorly and honestly unfunny joke. But out of context, in the way in which many may read it, it is strikingly more concerning. The point isn&#x27;t whether it was a joke though, the point is that universities have a long history in the US of being the centre of vicious and deplorable acts of violence, mass violence. In the context of the university environment, I can see how jokes like this are unsettling and reminiscent of real social media posts that often proceed real attacks that maim or kill real people. The authors insensitivity to is shortsighted.<p>This is ... peculiar.  Of the total number of off-colour jokes told by people at college campuses, what percentage are followed immediately by shooting sprees? How many decimal points do you need? This is not a usable or workable early warning system. If you genuinely think your hackathon is at risk of a Virginia Tech situation, get a metal detector. Mass murderers are unlikely to check the code of conduct before opening fire.<p>But then your concern doesn&#x27;t seem to be that people could actually get shot to pieces, simply that somebody could have been unsettled by a pun. This is a level of inconvenience that nobody has any right to be protected from.<p>It is utterly unreasonable to expect people to avoid in advance every possible &#x27;trauma trigger&#x27;, since by definition that&#x27;s (for practical purposes) an infinite quantity. In reality, the only code of conduct that can reliably avoid all such awkward social situations is the Trappist code of silence. So it would be better all round if people were expected to deal with these things like adults, and instead of looking over Facebook comments with the intention of linking them to terrorist atrocities, campus shooting, or any other terrible thing that it <i>could</i> mean to somebody somewhere, read them as <i>charitably</i> as possible. If you&#x27;re reading something out of context, <i>find out the context</i> before declaring it &#x27;distasteful&#x27;, since taste is 100% context.<p>The take away here should be: codes of conduct of the nature that caught out the OP are necessarily non-transparent (who accused him?), and thus necessarily arbitrarily enforced, and thus necessarily unjust (since justice must be seen to be done).",1442820410

But the point isn&#x27;t whether it was a joke though, the point is that universities have a long history of being the centre of vicious and deplorable acts of violence, mass violence. In the context of the university environment, I can see how jokes like this are unsettling and reminiscent of real social media posts that often precede real attacks that maim or kill real people.

Usually, the reaction to the idea that engineers should really unionise is causes an immediately hostile reaction. A union is what you (the members) want it to be, and a union that only addressed certain topics[1] would probably stop some problems from happening at all. There&#x27;s no reason to authorize a union to interfere with the more mundane problems unless you <i>want</i> those feature and design the union to have those powers.<p>The key thing to remember - which the usual knee-jerk anti-union rhetoric ignores - is that problems start to grow when too much power accumulates in any one place. <i>Neither</i> labor <i>or</i> capital can be allowed to grow to powerful, as it is the conflict between them that keeps each side restrained. A few decades ago we saw the problems of labor getting too powerful, and before that the problems of capital (business owners) having too much power was obvious. Like any control system, you have to design feedback[2] into the control mechanisms.<p>[1] Issues involving collusion like the recent wage-fixing agreement between Apple/Google/Intel/{...} or the &quot;working recent grads to death&quot; (13 hours/day, 7 days/week) that EA used to require.<p>[2] If only we had a sociological version of a PID controller.",1442819352

Here&#x27;s why:<p>Animal rights aside (because that has nothing to do with the restriction of pork), only the person eating pork is <i>harmed</i>. When Americans consume pork, it doesn&#x27;t harm the Afghans who don&#x27;t consume pork. Meaning, everyone eating pork is freely volunteering to do so. No one involved in eating of pork is involved against their will. Whatever the punishment might be in the afterlife, it only involves those who consume pork. In a sense, it&#x27;s a victimless <i>crime</i>. Again, putting animal rights aside.<p>However, having sex with young boys involves the unwilling young boy.

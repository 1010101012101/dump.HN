If they are going to use an apple try adding a stem and branch or something in the background.

If you go back several years and look at sites people defined as ""cutting edge"" or ""futuristic"", they were mostly gawdy Flash-ridden wastes of space that were certainly unique, but ultimately unusable and hard on the eyes.

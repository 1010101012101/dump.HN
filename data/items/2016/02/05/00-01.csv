I currently work at an enterprise software firm, and this is exactly what happens with each new client.<p>In addition to the compressed timelines and ridiculous feature requests that must be honored... in terms of the product itself, you have to do one of the following:\n1) Maintain separate codebases for each client, or \n2) Build the application so it can handle different features for each client, since each client will want different things.<p>Neither course of action is nearly as pleasant as having products that are the same for all customers.",1454633997

11038607,comment,11036554,11037351,0,0,hinkley,,,"The other reason to keep the DB separate is that they have different IO patterns that are not always complementary, and it&#x27;s easier to gather diagnostic metrics if the data isn&#x27;t munged.  In the days of physical servers you&#x27;d also choose different hardware for the DB machine.<p>Configuration capture is a big thing, and it separates the adults from the kids.  I&#x27;ve had hardware failure of my dev box twice in my career, and when I tell certain people that I have to rebuild my machine you can see their faces blanche.  These are the people I know I haven&#x27;t converted yet.<p>Everything important, except for the handful of things I&#x27;m actively investigating, is always stored on shared machines.  Version control.  Wiki.  Some sort of artifact repository.  The instructions for getting an environment set up with version X of our software are also stored in one of those places, and have been vetted by every new developer and some of the QA team.  I can have my machine back up and running in a couple of hours, and most of that is waiting for downloads, if we didn&#x27;t have the presence to store copies locally.<p>Why do I care about this stuff?  Seems sort of OCD on the face of it, and maybe you&#x27;re right.  But sooner or later you&#x27;re going to have a high severity issue in production that should be an all-hands-on-deck affair, and if you haven&#x27;t done this work, losing a hard drive on a dev laptop will be the least of your worries.  Everyone busy doing work on X+1 needs to be able to get back to version X and all of its dependencies in under an hour, and by themselves, because the people who could help them are most likely on the front lines of fixing the bug as fast as possible.<p>What&#x27;s more, someone probably needs to get versions X-1 and X-2 running to figure out if you need to warn people using older versions.  So that&#x27;s getting people running 3 or 4 versions of your software autonomously, so that you can identify repro steps, long and short term mitigation strategies, verify that they work, formulate a bulletin and provide patches for people. Not only do you need to get your configuration captured/documented, you need it captured 2-3 versions of your software ago, which means you need to start thinking about this stuff pretty early in your project.",1454633869

Everything is on github because everyone uses it, and everyone uses it because everything is on github. Github won for a few reasons.<p>Their only real competitors were Bitbucket (which was originally Mercurial and was late to the git party) and Google Code (which was taken to pasture along with Wave and Reader). Bitbucket is not targeted at individual users. It is targeted at teams and companies. Atlassian has played in the small business/enterprise market for a while. As evidence by Atlassians &quot;defeat&quot; of FogBugz. <a href=""http://movingfulcrum.com/why-fogbugz-lost-to-jira/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://movingfulcrum.com/why-fogbugz-lost-to-jira/</a> Google just kind of gave up on Google Code and closed the doors because it wasn&#x27;t the biggest kid in the playroom.<p>Also the explosion of repo/package tools (Bundler, npm, cargo) and automation lead people towards browsing repos instead of static assets. Github provides a ton of tools to deploy to package managers like npm or PaaS&#x27;s like Heroku dead easy. Github is not just a code repo, but a base for Continuous Deployment/Integration. &quot;<p>Github would benifit from the platform route over the software route. A cloud based software repo isn&#x27;t particularly special. A one stop for managing code, deploying software, working tickets, hosting docs, and more is special. Github has great tooling around pushes/commits but not issues/docs. Markdown is great if you&#x27;re a browsing a repo, but isn&#x27;t nice for non programmers. I would much prefer something like readthedocs.org integrated in.<p>Also github could look into offering services for enterprise customers. Github is fairly self service right now. They stand to make a fair amount of money charging for setting up deployments to AWS or Travis for you. Enterprise customers definitely overpay for simple stuff that could be done in an hour with proper docs.",1454633587

He recognized it as a mistake but out of some stubborn pride resolved not to fix it. Ever.  So damn skippy my response to him is &quot;Hahahahaha&quot;.  The programmers that have put up with his poor decision making obviously deserve respect.  I am sad that you assumed it was directed at the programmers having to deal with Guido.<p>Fortunately there is a simple solution -- fork Python 2.7 to make the Python 2.8 that Guido refuses to make.  A python version that doesn&#x27;t have compatibility issues with Guido&#x27;s playground programming.  This version would not have the poor performance of Python 3.  This version is essentially already made with PyPy.  I just wish everyone would have told Guido to get lost 7 years ago and switched to a development group with sane deprecation of features.  If we had then all of the programmer effort that was poured into making their code Guido approved would have been saved.  Can you imagine how much better Python development would have been without a 7 year lag that included BREAKING the code base of everyone who had previously programmed in Python 2.x?<p>Guido is the self proclaimed benevolent dictator for life.  However, that doesn&#x27;t describe a leader who breaks the programming efforts of every developer using the language prior to Py3k. He then has the stubborn arrogance to deny a transition version and instead requires 7 years of programming effort.  He certainly deserves a &quot;Hahahahaha&quot; that it took 7 years to get &quot;almost there&quot;.  At least he is not still shocked that py3k wasn&#x27;t greeted with open arms.  Hopefully before 2020 he will swallow his pride and agree to a transition version -- a 4.0 which works with 2.7 or a 2.8 that works with 3.x.  If not, a fork will happen.<p>Hopefully that clarifies the previous comment, and congratulations to the Scrapy developers for powering through and putting up with a language that was purposely broken by the language developers.",1454632358

They believe partying into the early hours is <i>wrong</i>, and they give this away with the victim-blaming nonsense and misleading statistics, if not outright lies, they offer regarding crime in Sydney, which this article rightly tears down. Likewise, the Australian government (and most other national governments) would have you believe that owning a gun is <i>morally wrong</i>, and the data they use to support this assertion are generally about as convincing as the arguments made to support these ridiculous restrictions on nightlife in Sydney. Indeed, anyone who has participated in or even observed a gun control &quot;debate&quot; should be pretty familiar with the sort of statistical dirty tricks perpetrated here by the City of Sydney.<p>At any rate, as an aside, in the future try to keep the ratio of strawmen to sentences in your post somewhere south of 1:1.

On Windows, that same forgiveness manifests itself as me not using my Windows machines as much as my Macs.  I still love to use my PCs, but not for anything that I need to rely on the majority of the time.<p>Now, though, Apple is making changes to things (iPhoto/Aperture were a really great example) where it seems like the change is just to bring parity of some sort to OS X and iOS rather than introducing new features.  iPhoto was buggy as hell when they added Faces and Places to it, but I totally forgave that because 99% of the time it was making my life way easier than it was before by detecting faces properly.  If it crashes every now and then, it at least saved the data, so I was still better off than I was before the update.  I still like Final Cut X (I know, I know... I&#x27;m an outlier), but convincing me that a switch like iPhoto/Aperture -> Photos is worthwhile is much harder since there&#x27;s nothing to distract me away from those issues and I&#x27;ve somehow managed to actively lose features that they convinced me were necessities in the past.<p>I hope this is not an indicator of things to come.  One thing that gives me some hope is that they&#x27;ve gone back to alternating between feature updates and stability updates.  Leopard was cool, but Snow Leopard was incredible to me.

A define written in uppercase might be better if you want to signify that it&#x27;s something changeable, but the typedef is probably slightly safer.<p>The real issue here is not the typedef, but the name choice.   &quot;float_t&quot; is a reserved name, and it&#x27;s unlikely to be a good idea to typedef a reserved name.

11038305,comment,11036554,11037644,0,0,derefr,,,"I guess I was thinking in terms of using EBS for ephemeral business-tier nodes, rather than as the backing store of your custom database-tier. (I usually use AWS&#x27;s RDS Postgres for my database.)<p>For ephemeral business-tier nodes, EBS gives you a few advantages, but none of them are that astounding:<p>• the ability to &quot;scale hot&quot; by &quot;pausing&quot; (i.e. powering off) the instances you aren&#x27;t using rather than terminating them, then un-pausing them when you need them again;<p>• the ability for EC2 to move your instances between VM hosts when Xen maintenance needs to be done, rather than forcibly terminating them. (Which only really matters if you&#x27;ve got circuit-switched connections without auto-reconnect—the same kind of systems where you&#x27;d be forced into doing e.g. Erlang hot-upgrades.)<p>• the ability to RAID0 EBS volumes together to get more IOPS, unlike instance storage. (But that isn&#x27;t an inherent property of EBS being network-attached; it&#x27;s just a property of EBS providing bus bandwidth that scales with the number of volumes attached, where the instance storage is just regular logical volumes that all probably sit on the same local VM host disk. A different host could get the same effect by allocating users isolated local physical disks per instance, such that attaching two volumes gives you two real PVs to RAID.)<p>• the ability to quickly attach and detach volumes containing large datasets, allowing you to zero-copy &quot;pass&quot; a data set between instances. Anything that can be done with Docker &quot;data volumes&quot; can be done with EBS volumes too. You can create a processing pipeline where each stage is represented as a pre-made AMI, where each VM is spawned in turn with the same &quot;working state&quot; EBS volume attached; modifies it; and then terminates. Alternately, you can have an EC2 instance that attaches, modifies, and detaches a thousand EBS volumes in turn. (I think this is how Amazon <i>expected</i> people would use AWS originally—the AMI+EBS abstractions, as designed, are extremely amenable to being used in the way most people use Docker images and data-volumes. The &quot;AMI marketplace&quot; makes perfect sense when you imagine Docker images in place of AMIs, too. Amazon just didn&#x27;t consider that the cost for running complete OS VMs, and storing complete OS boot volumes, might be too high to facilitate that approach very well. Unikernels might bring this back, though.)",1454630584

The definition (admittedly paraphrased) comes from Adam Smith. The gist is that anyone can freely participate in the market on an equal or fair basis without artificial constraint. There is sometimes a need for strong regulation to prevent larger participants from using their size to gain an unfair advantage in the market.<p><i>Government regulation it need not be . . . </i><p>Can you give me an example of effective non-governmental regulation that doesn&#x27;t ultimately derive its authority from the government?<p><i>How did you reach this conclusion? . . .</i><p>I am currently reading a book about the so-called &quot;Robber Barons&quot; of the later half of the 19th century. If you want to see what truly unconstrained capitalism looks like, I suggest you read up on this period: fraud, price-fixing, market manipulations, extortion, bribery . . . they even resorted to armed conflict with their rivals on occasion. The fact that capitalists continue to try to exploit any advantage that they can in the face of strong regulation is precisely my point. Heck, even in my own comparatively small investments, I seek to exploit any advantage that I can. It is not rocket science; it is acting in one&#x27;s own best interest. The job of regulation is to ensure (as much as is reasonably possible) that no one gains an unfair advantage.<p>I&#x27;ve talked a lot about regulation, so I want to make clear that I am not in favour of endless reams of red tape. Regulation should be as complex as it needs to be, but no more complex. What regulations there are should be strongly enforced. The current reality does not really live up to this ideal; there are many ineffective or unnecessary regulations, and there are regulations that are missing entirely. Nevertheless, I am talking about an ideal vision that we should strive toward.",1454630496

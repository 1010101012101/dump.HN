9872329,comment,9871819,9872266,0,0,curiousjorge,,,"> They have the unemployment rate they have thanks to the unsustainable - something even the IMF admits - austerity measures.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t help that there has been no innovation or large industries creating jobs in the first place. Blame austerity all they want but EU is not responsible for job creation or the livelihood of individual countries, I think that&#x27;s up to the leaders of each country, and being competent helps.<p>> South Korea was never subject to the kind of ludicrous austerity demands that Greece got, had their own currency and so were able to improve their export competitiveness much more easily, as well as was able to - and aggressively did - restructure many of the banks and businesses that dragged their economy down because they were not detail-controlled to nearly the extend Greece has been.<p>You are downplaying the fact that there are other countries that were in South Korea&#x27;s position never really recovered. It&#x27;s not something that can be done easily, of course in hindsight it&#x27;s always obvious. However, the fundamental problem is that there simply is no major global player industry in Greece to start, of course it&#x27;s going to have a harder time getting back up. By no means was South Korea given an easier time, the debt payments were just as harsh if not worse. Jobs were destroyed, society changed but in the end they were able to pull themselves out by actually focusing on getting back on their feet.<p>> Greece is not allowed by the Troika to choose how to reform their economy, so this option is not on the table for Greece unless it exits the Euro.<p>So you are telling me Greece is not allowed to save itself? This is ludicrous. This is akin to saying I&#x27;m homeless because I&#x27;m not suppose to help myself. I don&#x27;t blame the Greek people however, they just don&#x27;t know of any other option other than the one that has been prescribed to them for close to a century.<p>> 
Because the alternative is they get nothing? Debt always comes with risk. The interest rate is meant to price that in. If you can&#x27;t deal with the risk of a restructuring, don&#x27;t lend money. Except the lenders in this case learned a different lesson: your risks get socialised by the tax payers, and your government will then act like mobsters to try to recover the money, instead of letting the banks that took the risk also take the losses.
Why should Greece put up with the kind of attitude Germany has shown? Why should Europe?<p>Why shouldn&#x27;t Germany feel bitter about having to keep Greece on lifeline out of their own pockets? I mean you make it sound like Germany has had it easier but from the rubbles of Allied bombing, as it emerged as an economic powerhouse and leaders of EU. When a tenant continues to be delinquent on rent, they get kicked out. Of course they blame the land lords but does it improve their situation? Does it win them a ticket back in? Here, we&#x27;ll let you keep living on our dime while everyone else makes regular payments.",1436666262

9872322,comment,9871819,9872183,0,0,scarmig,,,"Eh, it&#x27;s hard to feel too empathetic toward the Greek state, but this entire situation is a tragedy for the Greek people, and the Euro-elite are just as guilty as the Greek state for the status quo.<p>It was always known that the Greek state was not up to par for the euro. They only got in because of a lot of shady dealings and extensive help from Goldman Sachs to mask the reality of their situation. The Euro-elite knew this at the time, but were willing to overlook it because of an idealistic commitment to a pan-European ideology.<p>Yes, a can was obviously being kicked down the road, but the seed of an incipient crisis was a pro: when things got terrible enough, it&#x27;d allow for the fiscalization of Europe, which would be difficult to do absent a crisis but was a pre-requisite for a real United States of Europe, the end goal where national governments would all be subsumed by the rule of a cosmopolitan elite centered on Brussels.<p>So money poured into Greece, because its bonds offered a higher interest rate than other bonds, and everyone figured, there&#x27;s no way the Eurozone would allow Greece to default. And, for a long time, Europe tried its hardest to prevent a default, but never could build the political will that the radical transformation a permanent solution to the Euro-periphery issue would need. Note, though, that the primary benefactors of the bailouts and transfers were the holders of the toxic debt, debt that had always obviously been bad debt, and not Greek school teachers or pensioners, who bore the real pain of the reforms. German banks ended up a lot happier from the packages than anyone in Greece, and funneling the bailout funds for them through Greece was a kind of political money laundering.<p>Obviously Greece has a messed up political culture, and even now it still needs more reforms. But it takes two to tango, and the European elite was plenty happy to dance with  the corruption and malignancy of the Greek state when it suited their interests. At this point Greece needs to do what&#x27;s best for the Greek people (though what that is is the big open question, and it&#x27;s clear that this is a quest for the least of a couple different evils) and screw the interests of outsiders.",1436666167

9872319,comment,9871819,9872184,0,0,copx,,,"As a German I find your complete misrepresentation of reality insulting. The German political class is the reason why Greece still has the Euro.<p>The Eastern Europeans never wanted to bail-out the Greeks to begin with, and have zero sympathy for their cries about inhumane austerity because the &quot;austere&quot; Greeks are still better off than the Eastern Europeans. Thus any transfer of money from e.g. Lithuania to Greece is perceived as a crying injustice.<p>But even in Western Europe Germany is close to being Greece&#x27;s best friend. The first bail-out was almost sabotaged by the Finns when they demanded collateral for their money. Which caused the Dutch to ask for that too. Meanwhile Evil Evil Sch√§uble knew that the Greeks would never be able to pay back that money - and lied to the German people about that &quot;your money is safe, we will get everything back&quot;, he said.. shortly before agreeing to the first haircut. Billions of Euros of German tax payer money evaporated.<p>Without the German government Finnish and Dutch ships would have transported away the Greek statues, gold, and whatever other valuable thing they could find. And if &quot;European solidarity&quot; depended on the Eastern Europeans the Greeks would have never gotten a cent.<p>The Greeks who are so fond of the Euro should be endlessly thankful to the German political class (not the people - they never supported this bail-out).<p>I think this is also the primary reason why Sch√§uble does not want another haircut. His original lie would become even more severe and the German electorate would become even angrier.",1436666140

9872208,comment,9870227,9871994,0,0,douche,,,"Initially.  The first Opium War was mostly the result of some very rich, but highly leveraged, and politically connected British merchants (including the East India Company, which before the institution of the Raj, was nearly a state unto itself in south-east asia) who had a massive quantity of illegal opium seized and destroyed by the Qing governor, who then proceeded to close the markets and quarantine the merchants in their factories.  Eventually, amidst high tensions the next year, there was an incident between Britsh, merchant and Qing ships off Canton, which flared things up into a shooting war.  The Brits rushed in troops and ships from India, and owing to the Qing empire&#x27;s traditional focus on suppressing more recently conquered regions of Inner Asia and opposing Russian expansionism, the British forces met very little resistance.  The blockaded the coast, swept the very much over-matched Qing navy aside (the Qing navy was more of an anti-piracy force, really), and launched an attack towards the Imperial capital.<p>There was a long tradition in imperial China of buying off invading barbarians to get them to go home and stop causing havoc.  To some extent, this was formalized in the imperial tribute system, which was used relatively successfully to placate the Khitan, Mongol, Turkic and Manchu neighboring states in various periods.  It is possible to view the Treaty of Nanjing in this tradition, at least from the Qing perspective; although from the Western side it&#x27;s clearly a punitive concession of defeat.  This then opened up a floodgate of other commercial nations wanting the same trade concessions (access to additional trade ports, abolition of tariffs) to keep up.<p>Later, with the advent of steam power, the different Western nations desired naval bases and coaling stations, to protect trade and project power.  And eventually, Western nations began building infrastructure in China, at the cost of further, sometimes extensive territorial concessions.  In some sense, this was accelerated by the global land-grab and prestige race between the great powers during the Victorian Age, which also coincided with the rapid modernization of Meiji Japan, which sought to wring the same kinds of concessions from the Qing Empire as the western nations.",1436663641

My grandfather worked as a security guard there 35+ years ago and now I am there as a software dev. intern. It was strange, on my first day, a senior engineer told us interns that Motorola was in the strange transition from a &quot;hardware company to a software company.&quot; There was a lot of talk and general anxiety in the air about where the company was headed. As this post mentioned, the fire and ideas seemed to be nonexistent. My mentor would tell me that it was our job to primarily focus on the radios and release upgrades over long time periods. Nothing was being built or researched, only maintained and slightly tweaked. There was neither passion nor excitement at the company. Towards the end of the internship, the company sold part of the business to Zebra technologies and with it some of the employees. Many physicists and electrical engineers were let go. The factory and learning center was shutdown and the company decided to sell the facility. We currently rent back a small portion.<p>Currently on the premises, there is a small Motorola Mobility office, whilst owned by Lenovo, still has a very Google feel when you look through their glass windows. There have been talks of various healthcare companies and even Magic Leap moving into the other vacant area we used to inhabit.<p>I still have hope in this company. I&#x27;m currently into the second internship and the gears are starting to move rapidly.

into Rudin!  He got less
terse over time.  His
<i>Real and Complex Analysis</i>
is terrific -- hardly terse at all.<p>The only question
I had was, why <i>regular</i> Borel
measures?  Sure, if I went back
and studied again where he used
the hypotheses I&#x27;d see it.<p>But in Rudin&#x27;s favor, e.g.,
for his <i>Principles</i>,
it&#x27;s
all there, and crystal clear,
very precise, and perfectly correct.  
Yes, have to draw own figures,
at least between ears, maybe
on paper.<p>Students might be told that
one of the purposes of the 
early material in Rudin&#x27;s 
<i>Principles</i> is to build a 
really solid foundation for
discussing continuity and
uniform continuity.  So, for
that, he wants compactness.
He uses that work to show that,
with continuity on a compact 
set and, thus, uniform
continuity, the
Riemann (Riemann-Stieltjes)
integral exists.
Then near the end of the book
he shows that the uniform
limit of continuous functions
is continuous.<p>But, also he goes ahead and
shows that a function has
a Riemann integral if and only
if it is continuous everywhere
except on a set of Lebesgue
measure 0, without really
saying much about Lebesgue 
measure.<p>I don&#x27;t have much from Apostol.

I&#x27;d change your headline to something more concrete, like &quot;Gmail, the way you want it&quot; while also finding a way to move up some of the product-specific content higher up on the page.<p>-You also have way too much text and the two paragraphs that start with &quot;Gmelius, pronounced &#x27;Gmail&#x27;-&#x27;jus&#x27;...&quot; seem unnecessarily long and distract me from finding out more about your project. I actually read that and just skipped past that whole block of text and later realized I had also overlooked your donation box.<p>-There&#x27;s also too much text explaining the features, making those screenshots look tiny in comparison. I think you could just get rid of the descriptive text and keep the feature titles, like &quot;Restore the old compose window&quot; and &quot;Experience Gmail without ads&quot; without losing any of the message.<p>-Minor point: That red download box should explicitly tell me it&#x27;s not supported for Safari, if you&#x27;re detecting my browser. Right now it says &quot;Free Download for Safari&quot; in bold text with &quot;Browser not supported&quot; in a lighter typeface underneath.

Thanks to the blockchain you kind of can&#x27;t lie too much, unlike, say, cash.<p>2. If the government wants to ban certain activities it can do so easily. Suppose that the government wants to keep its citizens from gambling or from using mixer services, it could declare that it won&#x27;t recognize Bitcoins that passed through those services as legal tender. Good luck paying property taxes with your tainted bitcoins.<p>... and so on. Things are not that different. In fact the blockchain may mean that the government has more, and not less, access to information: for example governments generally can&#x27;t access information from other countries except in rare occasions.

It does perhaps reflect the &#x27;philosophy&#x27; of Javascript, as evidenced by all the people in this thread defending this awful behaviour.  Take the example of Io, which has a lot of similarities to JS but has stronger typing and syntax that I hope is fairly self explanatory:<p><pre><code>  list(-3, 4, 10, 6, 1, 2) sort\n  ==> list(-3, 1, 2, 4, 6, 10)\n</code></pre>\nAnd to show that you can implement the Javascript behaviour in a language without implicit type conversions:<p><pre><code>  list(-3, 4, 10, 6, 1, 2) map(asString) sort\n  ==> list(-3, 1, 10, 2, 4, 6)\n</code></pre>\nJavascript merely defines the standard sort function to be the latter.<p>One difference between Io and Javascript is that<p><pre><code>  &quot;10&quot; > 2\n</code></pre>\nthrows an exception in Io (argument 0 to method &#x27;>&#x27; must be a Sequence, not a &#x27;Number&#x27;) so you can&#x27;t sort a list that is a mixture of strings and numbers without explicitly converting them first (or using a custom comparator), since the standard sort function won&#x27;t convert things for you (how would it know what you wanted to convert them to?). However that code is valid in Javascript, and actually returns &#x27;true&#x27;. So the amusing thing here is that the > operator in Javascript actually does what you want (converts to numbers rather than strings) and if you sort with a custom comparator using the greater than operator then I presume it would give the correct result for an array of numbers. Something like this (disclaimer I&#x27;m not a Javascript developer, following code may be wrong):<p><pre><code>  [7, -3, 6, 10, 1].sort(function(a, b){return a > b ? 1 : -1;});\n  [-3, 1, 6, 7, 10]\n</code></pre>\nFor whatever bizarre reason the standard sort function is defined to convert to strings first.",1383050352

Two of them are weak, data-description languages, one is strong and general-purpose. You have to learn all three, and learn about the quirks and sunspots accumulated over the years.<p>So, as a thought experiment, imagine what it would be like to work with a single language that was general-purpose, but also excellent at describing data, especially the trees (HTML) and property lists (CSS) that make up web documents. Perhaps it knows about the intended lifecycle of your HTML in a more structured way. Perhaps other flatly descriptive parts of your application can be merged with the &quot;flat&quot; styling of your CSS descriptions. Perhaps the idea of &quot;binding&quot; is built-in.<p>After that, there&#x27;s technical hoopla. If it&#x27;s interpreted in the browser, you need to be light and parse quickly, you need to be able to &quot;JIT&quot; chunks of code into optimized JavaScript when necessary, and you need to be able to dynamically generate the appropriate source maps, so that it feels closer to a seamless experience.<p>Is such a unifying language possible?

Small example, in JS, if you have a function that works on a &quot;age&quot; property of an object, it doesn&#x27;t matter what kind of object you send in, as long as it has an &quot;age&quot; property. You can do this easily in staticly typed languages as well, but you have to write more code (generics, class/struct-definitions, interfaces ...).<p>> I mean, if I have a variable I ALWAYS know what kind of data I expect in it<p>Really? Why did people invent generics/templates, interfaces and class-inheritance then? You won&#x27;t always know what type you are receiving, and alot of the time you don&#x27;t really care either, as long as it meets your criteria.<p>> The problem is that you hardly have a choice nowadays<p>Course you do: C/C++, Haskell, OCaml, Go, Nimrod... Soon you&#x27;ll have Rust to play with as well.<p>> <wait for GC... ok, done><p>Depends on your usecase. As long as your active memory use don&#x27;t number in multiple GBs, GC is quite fast. I have an application spawning 1GB of garbage a second, this takes 5ms (a second) to collect. Not bad IMHO. The work they are doing on the new G1 collector also seems promising. Btw, GC can in many cases have lower overhead than ARC (Python also does ARC btw).<p>> strongly typed but still allows generic object pointer (id)<p>Last I checked, most of Obj-C prefers dynamic typing. NSArray and NSDictionary for instance, can contain any type. Regarding (id), most languages allows this. &quot;Object&quot; in Java/C#, void* in C/C++, interace{} in Go etc.<p>In the end, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what language you use, as long as it gets the job done. If your language isn&#x27;t available, you&#x27;re mostly able to use another language anyway. Almost every language nowadays has a JS-compiler.

It&#x27;s a nice solution.  &#x27;Def&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really work for lambdas, do does, but curly-brace blocks are nicer in Ruby if you put them everwhere {|x| x+1}...  Keep in mind that Javascript is alot like Scheme in that there isn&#x27;t really a difference between named and anonymous functions.  You can write Scheme and Javascript pretty much the same way...",1383048183

Also, like every other company, we review on an annual basis, where we allocate our budgets.<p>The decision to stop financially supporting any project is down to our assessment of what we&#x27;ve been able to help that project to achieve, and if there are opportunities to invest in other projects that are at a different stage in development, or if it relates to a specific customer need.<p>As has been pointed out elsewhere in this thread, the Engine Yard platform now supports Ruby, PHP and Node JS, and will soon be supporting Java, as well as a number of different databases.<p>Engine Yard has always contributed to the communities that its customers come from, and adding platform support for these languages and databases means that we need to consider open source projects in those communities as beneficiaries of our financial support.",1383048077

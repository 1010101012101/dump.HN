Why use iphone.apple if apple can already do iphone.apple.com or apple.com/iphone? At the end of the day the consumer will not start guessing what domain he/she has to use to get what they want. The average consumer uses a search engine and types in &quot;apple iphone&quot;. They don&#x27;t care about iphone.apple they just want to go to the product page.",1427878741

9302435,comment,9301054,9302322,0,0,laumars,,,"> <i>That&#x27;s a security point, not a reliability point.</i><p>I appreciate the distinction you&#x27;re making, but in my opinion security and reliability are one and the same when you&#x27;re discussing authentication methods. The lack of security would render your system unreliable (as you can&#x27;t ever be certain the credentials are valid); and an unreliable software stack would be detrimental to the security of the authentication (bugs are, after all, often security issues).<p>> <i>They will be more reliable, as you don&#x27;t need to talk to e.g. MySQL that might be down or slow. This disadvantage is that they&#x27;re difficult to revoke.</i><p>I&#x27;m all for building fault tolerant systems, but the database being available is the bare minimum you&#x27;d normally need for a web / cloud / whatever service to operate. Even authentication aside, I&#x27;m not really sure what good the service would be with the database offline (so you can log in, but can you now post comments in the community portal, or use the CMS, or book manufacturing jobs, etc. And what about any required form of audit logging?). So I don&#x27;t really understand why you would need login process to be tolerant to that specific failure.<p>Your database performance point is an interesting one though. Personally I&#x27;d approach that by having the session table mirrored on a high performance key-value store to reduce the load on your RDBMS (to use your MySQL example). But then that solution quickly runs into additional security, reliability and complexity issues; much like using JWTs. So I&#x27;m definitely not trying to say my approach to the same problem is any better.<p>What I did find the most interesting about this JSON web token approach was a comment made by sandstrom (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9302304"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9302304</a>) where he discussed the decentralised / portability possibilities of such an authentication model. This isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve ever needed to consider in my line of work, but it seems a very useful method of linking different platforms in a clean way, and without them necessarily having direct access to each other.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m dismissing your points. It&#x27;s a very interesting solution on a common problem. Sometimes I need help to understand the process and the best way to do that is to question it so any ignorance (on my part) is counter argued and thus corrected :)",1427878335
9302434,comment,9301681,9302345,0,0,lazaroclapp,,,"Except this seems to be more a case of severe mental illness than conscious morality, as far as the facts go. Not that any mental illness renders a person criminally dangerous or unable to account for their actions (in fact the vast majority of mental illness cases don&#x27;t), but in this particular case it would seem at least possible that doing harm was partly beyond her conscious control. Also, if she wanted to get attention/help, you can argue that she meant to get caught, whether or not she also meant to cause harm.<p>Either way, I really hope all the affected are healthy, safe and taken care of physically and emotionally.

It&#x27;s not an excuse but online game launches, nearly without exception (most certainly <i>not</i> exclusive to EA), always go like that. The reason is as Blizzard described it with the Diablo launch: during a launch you have a massive influx of players of which a good amount completely lose interest over the next week or two. <i>Buying</i> servers (which, keep in mind, the majority of game publishers still do) would be a huge waste of money.<p>It&#x27;s set to improve as the cloud comes into use (e.g. Titanfall, Camelot Unchained, ESO) but there is still resistance against it.<p>> Battlefield launches are terrible and so on.<p>Be fair, that had nothing to do with capacity - that was a rushed product. I played it from beta, through early access and into release <i>never</i> being denied a login due to capacity. The game crashed, the sound didn&#x27;t work, it was extraordinarily buggy and unfinished; yes, but don&#x27;t claim there was capacity problems.<p>You are confusing EA&#x27;s ability to write code and manage infrastructure with their tendency to be greedy and willingness to release unfinished products.

You have to be careful with JWK in a similar way: the public key can be specified a as a URL via the x5u parameter, you have to make sure you only trust keys from a whitelisted URL otherwise whoever supplies the token signed with a JWK can just provide their own public key and self-sign it.<p>This can be problematic and need some leg-work on a developer&#x27;s side when the URLs to be whitelisted aren&#x27;t documented. For example Apple use a similar signed blob to allow 3rd parties to verify a Game Center identity, using generateIdentityVerificationSignatureWithCompletionHandler. The data you get back includes the publicKeyUrl, but not which URLs to expect. A naive implementation would just download the public key and run with it. Bad for two reasons: you&#x27;re now downloading data from an arbitrary location and you are trusting a signature that you verified using untrusted information. In case anyone is interested, the two locations I&#x27;ve seen Apple provide here are <a href=""https://sandbox.gc.apple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sandbox.gc.apple.com</a> and <a href=""https://static.gc.apple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://static.gc.apple.com</a> .",1427877717

It seems pretty obvious to me that Google is trying to push the mainstream consumer market into a &quot;cloud computing/services lifestyle&quot;, it only makes sense because their whole business model revolves around web users. So VLC is out, Netflix/Playstore is in.<p>Not for me, don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not that kind of consumer and it may be safe to state that most people within the HN crowd isn&#x27;t either.

I&#x27;ve never played any of the other games, but I can tell you after playing this for a while that this game is not for me due to how they implement the difficulty.<p>Just to give you an idea, it took me 7 or 8 years to beat Kingdom Hearts 1 because of how bad the camera was.  I got to a point where I just walked away.  I really dislike games that are difficult due to ackward controls, cheesy mechanics (such as enemies popping behind you in an area you just cleared), that sort of thing<p>I played it for a few hours but I got tired of things like<p>- you roll and the camera lifts up so you&#x27;re staring down at yourself and can no longer see the enemies you rolled from<p>- if you hit the enemy at the end of your range your attack pushes them back further than your characters steps forward so you miss the followup attack and they end up killing you (or hurting you badly).<p>- Sometimes when you attack an enemy they&#x27;ll slide sideways (I say sometimes, I mean quite often).  I&#x27;ve seen them slide so far they slide behind the camera at which point you&#x27;re guessing where they are based upon where they disappeared.<p>- Your attacks do random amounts of damage.  Sometimes it takes 3 hits to kill a mob, sometimes 4 or 5.  But because every attack uses stamina, you really want to use as few attacks as possible and sometimes you die for it because that 1 random enemy required an extra hit.  I never figured out why.<p>- the healing items appeared to give a random amount of health back.<p>- Some of the level designs appeared to be such that it maximized the pain of the camera.  One enemy in particular I&#x27;m thinking of is big and surroundedin by innumerable unbreakable boxes and such.  He wasn&#x27;t that difficult himself, but being able to avoid his attack successfull due to the aforementioned boxes, etc, was a tedious chore.<p>I can see the appeal to the game, but it just isn&#x27;t for me.  And this is coming from a guy who plays most games on hard.  But there&#x27;s a certain kind of difficulty I don&#x27;t enjoy and unfortunately this game lands right square in the middle of it.<p>edit:\nThe thing that caused me to respond in the first place.<p>The game moves slow overall.  You kill an enemy, he drops loot, but not immediately, so you end up waiting to see if he dropped loot.  If he does, you run to the body, hit X, wait for the confirmation to pop up, hit X again, and then eventually go on about your day.  When you&#x27;re playing the same level over and over again it gets <i>really</i> time consumingly tedious.  Add on to that the 30 second load screen (that&#x27;s not an exaggeration) and you have a game that&#x27;s pure tedium (atleast for me).",1427875968

At first, just lookup the words you dont know and after maybe one play you should have already learned enough to understand his style and language and &quot;get&quot; his works on their face value.<p>as far as literary references go - aka john milton - (basically the only reason you&#x27;d need a class), I really think you&#x27;d just have to read/know most of the greek/roman classics and the bible to be able to get most of them. But no worries, if you enjoy reading the classics are a blast, the hebrew old testament is packed with pretty cool stories (the mad king Nebuchadnezzer) and it doesn&#x27;t get much better than the iliad and odyssey.",1427875268

These politicians are driven by re-election, so they will focus on things that look like helping more than things that actually help. Legislating day-to-day consumers will have much more visibility than major org water usage restrictions. People like you are the reason they get away with this. You support what they are doing because you think it helps, so they will not bother with the stuff that really helps because that&#x27;s actually hard.",1427875205

Though this is more a personal library system which does not meed as much detail... but here are some suggestions.<p>Web access is good (I don&#x27;t have an iPhone... most of my friends have androids if they have a smartphone. :)<p>Make the checkout ID the barcode or a barcode...  So you can scan the book, this could be different than the ISBN.   Also a tool to create self-generated barcode labels for items that don&#x27;t have any barcodes (I preferred 1.75 x .5&quot; labels... I used TCPDF to make em, told folks to print the label sheets with &quot;scaling off&quot;, no printer/label alignment woes then.)  With barcodes you can enter the patron first, then rapid scan each item to check out, or when checking in just scan in the items.<p>You use patron number to checkout should have a facility to search by name... as mentioned get the checkout person&#x27;s credentials once and then check out the items till done.<p>Book info is sparse, if you have over 30 books you want to have some search properties and categorization.  Maybe tags so you can do searches to locate your vampire western novels...  :-)  Also if you ware having friends access your library is there some public facing url they can use to browse the owner&#x27;s library on-line?<p>Item location, when you get into the several hundred you should have a field for filing location - Dewey decimal is one  (though I don&#x27;t like it myself)  give am a 10 or 12 character field and some ideas on how to categorize thier library (i.e. never describe a specific location 3rd shelf, instead, say cookbooks...)...<p>I would put button on checkout to temporarily adjust loan duration, most friends might get the normal 14 days, other might need more (or less)<p>Checkout record/reciept, so people have a copy of what they borrowed... or so patrons can sign that they borrowed stuff and lender could take em to small claims if they don&#x27;t return (some private collections are pretty costly).. if you get into value, purchase/replacement cost.<p>A general limitless notes field for both for patrons and items would always be welcome...  (this would be only viewable by the owner, not in the public search thing I was mentioning previously)<p>Patron contact info - so you can shoot of an email or call them.  If email maybe add a facility to auto-generate a past due notice.<p>That&#x27;s it off the top of my head.  Nice start.",1374119866

I might also mention that I am the go to guy for a few well known VC&#x27;s that you have heard of although that is not my main business at all (although it could be it just doesn&#x27;t pay that well compared to other things I spend time on.)<p>This statement:<p>&quot;Within a day or 2 we started getting responses. All the responses were the same and were in the format of Sure we are willing to sell, we expect a bid in the mid to low 7 figures.&quot;<p>Is total BS and hyperbole. People in the business can be jerks and unreasonable for sure but it would be more likely for someone to &quot;ask&quot; for 100k or simply say &quot;domain is not for sale&quot; than to say &quot;7 figures&quot; (2 letter, possible, 3 letter, specifically &quot;all of the responses&quot;, no. Unless of course you emailed the same people (they may have different email address for the same owner) and they were pulling your chain.) Exaggeration.<p>&quot;When the price for a domain you like is really high, consider lease-to-buy options to give you flexibility.&quot;<p>I never recommend this it&#x27;s normally a way to make sure you pay an exorbitant price for a domain.<p>&quot;Dont get attached to any domain name. &quot;<p>Great advice. This is absolutely true.<p>&quot;When you find something you like, move FAST and close it as soon as possible. Often times you might not have a second chance.&quot;<p>I can say that I have closed a number of sales by simply making the buyer feel that someone else wants the same name, coincidentally the same day someone else inquired! Total bullshit. Good leads are extremely infrequent.  Possible but more likely you are being played with.<p>&quot;Good domain names get offers many times a week. Think about how youll make your email stand out from the rest.&quot;<p>In general not true. There is no serious bidding war going on for good domain names every day. There are people for sure that email everyone and anyone with non serious offers and to people who own many names it appears to be that you are getting offers all the time. But you might get no inquires on a particular good domain name in 1 year or 5. The only way you need to stand out is to appear to be a real buyer and act like a real buyer. Unfortunately if you are sending a bunch of emails that&#x27;s going to be hard to do.<p>&quot;Use domainworth.com to get a rough idea of how much their domain is worth.&quot;<p>Totally meaningless. By the way never try to negotiate with a seller quoting any estimate value. With very few exceptions means nothing. Very few exceptions means there are always outlier cases.<p>&quot;Use instantdomainsearch.com and leandomainsearch.com to help you check your desired names or come up with new ones.<p>Both good ideas.",1374119855

I want to be able to make a query and get an answer back in less than 60 seconds. I also want to be able to add arbitrary key value pairs to each event and filter steps in the funnel based on the presence of a particular value.\n-We need to be able to apply filters on users to the funnel and retention graphs that we look at.

Thanks.<p>The ability for apps to correlate across their own re-installations has fewer privacy implications than general UDID/MAC access, so perhaps Apple may allow it at some point. To achieve it, Apple could just change the documented behavior of the identifierForVendor property so that it no longer resets when all the vendor&#x27;s apps are deleted. Apple&#x27;s implementation could be done several ways (such as by stashing the per-device, per-vendor ID along with the App Store&#x27;s Purchased Software data, or by generating it algorithmically from a hash of UDID/MAC plus vendor ID).

An individual recording stuff they&#x27;re seeing anyway is pretty much &quot;their right&quot; - what they then choose to do with that recording though, is just as much their responsibility. For example, if you record someone walking out of Good Vibrations or Crazy Horse, and you choose to upload that to YouTube to make fun of them, and that person then loses their job over it (perhaps at the church-owned school they work at?) - I&#x27;d like to see you held to account for that action (and held financially responsible for breaching someone else&#x27;s privacy).<p>This is actually codified into my local (NSW, Australian) Law in part. It&#x27;s legal to record (audio and/or video) any interaction you have with a police officer. It&#x27;s _not_ legal to &quot;publish&quot; that recording without the officers consent. Practically, it&#x27;s been determined that you <i>can&#x27;t</i> introduce a recording of your interaction with police as evidence in court (at least without the recorded police&#x27;s agreement), but you _can_ tell the judge you&#x27;ve got a recording that proves a police officer is lying in his testimony, and the judge can request to see the recording. This has become very well known amongst profiled and targeted groups (for me, many motorcycle riders indiscriminately targeted as &quot;outlaw motorcycle gang members&quot; routinely record all police interactions and several high-profile lawyers recommend it).<p>Where I think this become important - is when many such recordings are collected together. Larry and his Glass, you and your Glass - they have small scale privacy implications, and barring those users doing something obviously stupid with them (which is no different from cellphone camera &quot;etiquette&quot; - if you go hanging outside abortion clinics, mental health clinics, drug rehabilitation centers, or schools with your camera/phone/Glass - and distribute the pictures you capture, you should expect consequences). I think though that Google (or anybody else) should consider the collection of many many user&#x27;s Glass images/video/audio to be a potential-nightmare privacy problem _for them_. Before they start archiving all that, I think someone should be asking the same sort of questions you&#x27;d ask the junior developer who says &quot;I&#x27;m just logging all the form data, so we can use it for debugging later&quot; - You&#x27;d be asking &quot;Hang on, _all_ the form data? The personally identifying information? The credit card number/expiry/ccv? The social security number? The medical history? And you&#x27;re just writing that all out in cleartext to the public webserver logfles? Ummm, nope. I&#x27;ve just revoked your commit credentials and powered down the webserver - you might want to gather your things, don&#x27;t let the door hit you in the ass on the way out&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be allowed&quot;, but I do think people implementing wholesale gathering of &quot;public space personally identifiable data&quot; should be held to high standards of responsibility for having that collection - &quot;High&quot; as in &quot;if we screw up and this data get misused/exposed/stolen, that&#x27;ll be to a very high level of likelyhood a CEO/CTO/company-destroying event&quot; standards. You don&#x27;t &quot;just collect all the health information you can&quot;, you don&#x27;t &quot;just collect all the credit card information you can&quot;, _I&#x27;d_ like public-space surveillance to be the same. I&#x27;d like mall operators to say &quot;Of course we don&#x27;t archive video surveillance - we&#x27;ve got procedures and policies in place to delete all recordings over 1 week old unless we get a written police request for specific cameras/times/persons-of-interest, and we have a monthly task that checks and ensures that policy is adhered to.&quot;",1374117385

AirBnB, Dropbox, Uber, and others in their weight class must employ at least 100-300 people.<p>By contrast the companies that fail tend to fail small.<p>So rather than saying &quot;1.4% of startups make it to IPO&quot;, what if we looked at it by individual? That is, if you are being hired, it&#x27;s more likely that you are being hired at a company that is likely to be successful (as they are able to pay your salary/hire you).<p>I&#x27;m not sure what the answer is and you&#x27;d need to do the math here. But my overall intuition is that a skilled engineer who did say 3-4 startups between 21 and 35 has a pretty good chance of getting a decent payday (say $500k-$1m+), while having a lot of fun. Of course, if you just want to optimize money you should just save and not spend.

I've always deep down wanted a degree but couldn't admit it to myself. I would for whatever reason regret it if I never earned a degree.\nb) When giving people advice around data I would like to train myself around many of the biases we are all so prone to. Learning though on the job in a business intelligence role seems like a very expensive feedback loop. (Imagine making a mistake in a recommendation that costs the company millions of dollars)\nc) I would like to eventually move into more machine learning and recognize that for now and the foreseeable future statistics and other math will play a HUGE role in that. For jobs in this realm a masters degree is very much encouraged.<p>Some background on me: My company and myself all work remotely so the discipline that an online degree requires isn't at all an issue for me. Also I am a self taught software engineer so I'm looking forward to taking whatever I learn through my courses and building on top of it as much as possible as I go.<p>Just to clarify my question is: I've found a math degree to pursue, what (1st or 2nd hand experience-based) feedback can you provide as advice?",1342968502

4277430,comment,4276518,4277314,5,0,techsupporter,,,"You're missing two key understandings of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act: First, the Act allows museums and similar institutions to own and transport bald eagles.  Second, the article states that the bird was acquired prior to the Act taking effect in 1940.  That means that current possession is legal, provided that it doesn't change ownership.  For a similar situation, look at zoning laws.  A property can be ""legal nonconforming"" because it was, at one time, in compliance with zoning laws but is not any longer.  Why?  Because both types of laws carry criminal penalties and it is unconstitutional to retroactively make something a crime.  The artist can keep the bird, will it to his heirs (generally, passage to one's heirs doesn't trigger ""change in ownership"" laws), and do the other trappings of ownership but No One Else Can who isn't able to comply with the law, like a museum.  Ergo, his heirs can't sell it except to the museum.  The museum isn't willing or able to buy it--the piece is already on loan to them for free--so there is no market and, therefore, no value.",1342968203

You can choose not to work with employers like this, but you won't actually know they will do this until they do it. In the end though, that is your time, and your rate goes down if you work more for the same amount.<p>(2) You will frequently work less than a day and charge for a day. This will of course keep some employers from hiring you, because they'll worry about your higher effective rate that what they would calculate for an 8 or even 6 hour day. But, let's say that they hire you. At some point, you'll send an email stating that you are done with the feature earlier in the day rather than later, because you have somewhere to be that night and don't want to forget, and then this puts the seed in their head that you didn't work a full day, and that for all they know, you may do that everyday with them if they aren't communicating with you all day to determine you are working for them.<p>(3) Although potential employers may attempt to do the math and convert what they perceive as your hourly rate based on your daily rate to what they get out of other hourly workers, much of the time, they won't want to bother. If anything, if I were trying to estimate your hourly rate, I'd divide your daily rate by 4 and assume that is basically your effective rate.

For some, it can be a steady, continuous feedback loop thats difficult to break. Ive wrestled with it myself. For me, it takes the form of the imposter phenomenon and it becomes more pronounced when Im in groups of smarter people or when I perceive there to be particularly more at stake than normal situations. What are you doing here, youre not smart enough, how did you get this job, youre not good enough to run a successful startup etc. In the past, its caused me to freeze up, have trouble articulating what I want to get across or (worst of all) escape the situation entirely. As Ive gotten closer & closer to where I want to be as it relates to the startup ecosystem and my place in it, that inner voice has gotten louder. So I can certainly relate to that aspect of it. Its a battle thats fought anew every day.<p>And sometimes it does manifest itself in a more social context, e.g. nobody cares about me, etc. which can also be difficult to quell, particularly for someone whos more of an introvert at heart. Left unchecked, I can clearly see how that can get the better of someone and send them down a destructive path, although I still think to take that anger and push it back out to society in such a violent way requires a synapse somewhere else misfiring.<p>It's a good reminder that external stimuli alone aren't usually to blame for negative, depressing feelings.",1342966652

They may well have a clear read on his motives right now. It is vital that they share this information fully with the public, but just as vital that they conceal much or all of it while they conduct their investigation. Testimony from friends, family and survivors of the massacre is also crucial, and witnesses are highly suggestible. Information must be withheld in the short run to safeguard corrupting their stories.""<p>This should be ROUTINE practice in police investigations, to guard against corruption of witness testimony, but, alas, we all know counterexamples. Moreover, it is a professional ethics violation for prosecutors to make excessively detailed statements to the press (who are always willing to ask for as many details as they can get) about the course of an investigation in progress and about possible motives for a crime when the accused has not yet been put on trial. The principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" is STILL important, despite many cases we can observe where it appears to be violated.<p>The human mind leaps to supposing explanations and forming a narrative around new, disturbing events. The mind is a ""belief engine""<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Believing-Brain-Conspiracies-How-Construct/dp/0805091254"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Believing-Brain-Conspiracies-How-C...</a><p>and all of us would like to get an answer, even a quick and dirty answer that may be flat wrong, rather than have unanswered questions about a shocking news story. I remember well the speculation that swirled around the Columbine High School shootings some years ago. I was active in a different online community then, and a bunch of programmers were unembarrassed about going beyond the limits of their occupational knowledge to endorse various hypotheses about why the shooters killed their classmates. Right now we don't know why James Eagan Holmes shot movie-goers, evidently planning well in advance to kill many strangers. I'm not going to speculate about it.<p>The public-health perspective on violence reduction is interesting, because it doesn't depend on knowing much about the motives of individuals. The theory is that certain risk-reduction measures work in general, minimizing the chance that some individual will engage in any kind of incident like the one in Aurora, Colorado. Gun control is such a sensitive issue in the United States that it is barely being discussed yet by politicians in connection with the incident this weekend, but differing national patterns of gun control have been mentioned by commentators who point to the example of Australia's response to the 1996 Port Arthur, Tasmania shooting<p><a href=""http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/20/opinion/donohue-gun-control/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/20/opinion/donohue-gun-contro...</a><p><a href=""http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8502957/smaller-risk-of-getting-shot-in-australia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ninemsn.com.au/national/8502957/smaller-risk-of-...</a><p>as the right way to reduce risk of further mass shooting incidents. That's food for thought. So far I am not aware of any reason for young people in residential neighborhoods in the United States to have what are called ""assault rifles"" for legitimate purposes, and I certainly would be glad to know that none are in my (crime-free) neighborhood.<p>First edit: I see other Hacker News commenters are picking up on the submitted article's author's remarks on depression. This may be overgeneralizing too much from one example, even though the author also refers to a Secret Service study of the small number of examples of school shooters studied to that time. I think the author's most accurate point on that issue is ""A vast majority of depressives are a danger only to themselves.""",1342966507

More successful cognitive behavioral therapy (which has been clinically proven to be as helpful as antidepressants in treating non-severe depression), tries to train people to think of alternatives to those shitty thoughts without necessarily saying which one alternative is right.  Turns out, getting in the habit of thinking not just the worse thing possible is actually quite helpful.  It gets you out of the rut your in.",1342965875

For a couple of years I have been trying to move towards self-employment, with some ups and downs, but I am making progress on a project together with my wife. Last year I had the chance to switch jobs and move elsewhere so I naturally targeted Berlin. I would like to keep working in a high-paying job while funding the startup that I work on in my free time. I noticed a few things:<p>There are a quite a few startup jobs, but they are low end, low paying. Many pay even less than what I started on 10 years ago. They are looking for those starting their first job I think. I get the feeling Berlin startups get a lot less funding that other startups.\nEven the non-startup jobs that require more experience seem to pay a lot less, and even with the slightly cheaper rent than other cities, I couldn't find any attractive options.\nThe official work experience I have on my CV is more enterprisy stuff like .NET and lots of stuff startups care less about like Scrum, Kanban, management in general and agile software development. I do have experience with things like Ruby, Python and JavaScript, but even startup employers were only interested in what was on my CV.<p>Not complaining or anything, just trying to help get a feel on what I found while looking there last year.<p>I found a good job near Frankfurt, and who knows, maybe I will end up in Berlin later, but I feel I might not need to. Frankfurt has a startup scene (and a rich financial sector). So does Cologne where I used to live.",1342965710

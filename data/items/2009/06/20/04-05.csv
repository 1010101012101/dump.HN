666149,comment,666123,666123,0,0,jimmyrcom,,,"When its your living you better be good or you get fired or quit. Generally the rule of thumb is make eye contact, be reassuring and repeat the persons name or say sir nearly every other fucking word.<p>There's all kinds of people out there, and you need to be specially careful about the ticking time bombs that for whatever reason are already pissed off with everything. The last thing you want is for people to make a scene; no matter how stupid or crazy what their demands or statements are, 'the customer is always right' and saying anything to the contrary, or even hinting a reaction to their attitude, can escalate the stupidest of arguments. In fact, they will blow up even more after they realize they were wrong instead of face embarrassment. Coincidentally the same salesman rules apply for dealing with women.<p>Any job where people come in confused and you have to explain a very limited set of most-often asked questions leads to frustration. Whether they're doctors, mechanics, police officers or people who think yahoo answers is some kind of intellectual hub when people hear the same stuff over, people start gaining a prejudice for the infinite influx of never ending confused people they have to work with.<p>My point is, when google has enough servers to have gained a self awareness you better hope you'd proven yourself a patient man through all your queries, for it will be judgement time. No seriously, this would have been more relevant and interesting if this had turned out programming related instead of HR. eg How do you deal with programming frustration or the frustration of learning new languages. Not the frustrations salesmen feel when responding to my questions.",1245473824

666144,comment,666123,666123,0,0,gizmo,,,"The only thing you really know is he didn't <i>show</i> frustration. But that aside.<p>When you've heard every question before and dealt with every type of customer before, you're simply going through the motions. Frustration is partly about feeling powerless, not knowing what to do or how to act.<p>Remember the frustration you felt when you first started using a new operating system. Settings change, and you don't know how to put them back. The boot loader crushes another partition. You suddenly have to do without a right mouse button. Many people feel that kind of frustration when dealing with computers -every single day-. We don't.<p>The salesperson can go through the motions in the same way we do when a package breaks /etc/X11/xorg.conf and we're left without a gui. When you go through the motions you're emotionally distant, so frustration won't come into play.",1245473474

666140,comment,665882,666095,0,0,TrevorJ,,,"Yep. It is very very bad here if you are looking for work. As more workers get laid off it gets even harder. ANY job is tough to find, let alone white collar work. Even traditionally in-demand jobs like nurses and truck drivers have tightened up. Michigan has passed a good film incentive package but the jobs films generate tend to be temporary and the volume of films shooting in the state would have to be enormousness to make a big difference.",1245472924

666138,comment,665735,665854,0,0,JoelMcCracken,,,"I don't know that it isn't, exactly, however I do know that there aren't many languages out there (that I know of?) which are viable because they have access to this massive library of code via C + SWIG, and I wonder why.<p>I thought of this idea one day, and did a bit of checking into C + SWIG, without much success toward figuring out why it isn't used like this. My intuition is that adding these things as standard libs is for some reason a little unclean. This solution allows language implementors to have more control over how things are implemented, and, for example, does not depend on something external like a c complier. My intuition may be very wrong.",1245472563

666133,comment,666123,666123,0,0,niyazpk,,,"Some people are very good at dealing with others, the same way some others are good at dealing with computers.<p>Of course, it is their natural ability. (That is why the salesman became a salesman!)<p>Even if we do not have a natural ability to make others comfortable and happy with us, it does not mean that we cannot cultivate that trait later. Just remember two things:<p><pre><code>    Smile.\n    Genuinely think about helping the other person, regardless of your motives.\n</code></pre>\nOn the <i>not getting frustrated</i> part, I honestly don't know how to do that. Anyway I will tell my story:<p>I wanted to change the world. I wanted people not to be stupid. I wanted people to do the right thing. We usually get frustrated when people look stupid to us. We want people to understand our logic, but it looks like they never will! I used to get frustrated a lot those days.<p>Then I learned the lesson that spreading happiness is better than spreading logic. People have their own logic, and it is not better/worse than what we have. It is just different. Make the others happy, make their lives better, help them in every way we can and that is better than trying to make them think in a rational way. Thinking more about it, it is the most logical way too.",1245472304
666131,comment,665735,665902,0,0,JoelMcCracken,,,"Print wouldn't be a good example, but think more along the lines of a TM-esque definition, which reads and writes to a ""tape"". ""print"" wouldn't work, but, for example, something that takes as an input an email and either accepts if it is validly formatted or rejects if not would be a good example. It doesn't require very much to get working, however it is hard to do correctly (how many places don't accept ""+"" in emails, for example).<p>So, possibly, it would be more useful for yes and no answer questions. Also, algorithms that are intended to do things quickly wouldn't work very well, as per the platform these are naturally very slow. It would be a bit silly to write a quicksort with this, for example.<p>Other examples that I can see working well:<p>xml parser<p>json parser<p>.... parser<p>html stripping<p>email format manipulation<p>basic binary file manipulation (untaring, possibly, reading/manipulation of networking packets...)<p>diff",1245472208

666117,comment,665449,665553,0,0,sho,,,"That's a nice thought, and I have had similar ones, but my instinct is that you have the ability to effect more change as a motivated free programmer than a single lawyer ever could. I don't think there is any possibility of one person, no matter how competent, changing the system from the inside, subject to the system's rules.<p>The tools of change are technological, not legal. Instead of trying to change the law, render it obsolete and utterly unenforcable, and ""win"" by fait accompli.<p>I feel a similar way about file sharing. I personally believe very strongly that the ability to send arbitrary files to arbitrary recipients unmolested is a right akin to free speech. But there is no point trying to ""beat the system"". The solution is to invent technology which renders the law an unenforcable joke.<p>It's a great time to be a programmer. The tools and opportunity to change the future course of events are right in front of us, to a degree far in excess of what your average non-billionaire voter (or lawyer) could ever enjoy.<p>We don't need more individual lawsuits. We need plausible deniability implemented in social networks, at a stroke rendering unreliable the whole practise of evaluating someone by their online activities.

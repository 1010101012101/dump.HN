It occurred to me that it might be helpful for beginner-types to have a place to go that collects pointers to these resources.  I can't be the only person with this idea, so why haven't I found  something like it?  Since I'm building my own study plan I've already found a lot of the content that would make the site.

A statement like this would never have occurred if Assange had not released these documents.<p>The standard rhetoric from Washington is that it's important to keep secrets, and that's why so much is classified, and why it needs to remain classified.  Assange AND Gates have demonstrated that this is not true, that release of these cables and the earlier military leak (which DoD found did NOT reveal any sensitive intelligence sources or methods) do not seriously threaten our safety.<p>Contrast that with statements from Sarah Palin, Congressperson Peter King, and others, who are basically calling for Wikileaks to be classified as a terrorist organization.  King in particular noted that the requirement seems to be met -- that Wikileaks represents a ""clear and present danger"" -- which seems to be contradicted by Gates' statement.  Also, in academic political science, terrorism is generally defined as -violence- against a non-military target to achieve a political end, so there's no terrorism involved here from an academic perspective.  If King is correct and that's the requirement, it is too broad.<p>Cablegate has thus been valuable in demonstrating hypocrisy among politicians and political hacks.

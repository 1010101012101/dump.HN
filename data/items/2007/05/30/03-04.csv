25327,comment,25280,25297,0,0,nostrademons,,,"There's value in using a v0.1.  It hasn't had a chance to get large and complicated yet, so it's easier to learn and less likely to break.<p>Good third-party components should solve a problem with a large surface area and present an interface with a small surface area.  I don't really see that with most frameworks: instead, they seem to solve a problem with a fairly small surface area and present an interface with a large surface area.  Not really a great combination.<p>I'm all for libraries and standards, though.  There's no way I could've built my app without Cheetah, PIL (despite installation headaches), Markdown, DBAPI, and WSGI.  These solve the <i>real</i> hairy problems, yet provide a small, often trivial interface to learn.",1180496789
25326,comment,25280,25280,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm using web.py.  I really didn't want something like Django or even Pylons where it feels like you're programming <i>to</i> the framework and not to the language.  In my experience (with other frameworks), this leads to a really quick 80%, and then you get really screwed over as you try to complete the remaining 20% and have to fight the framework all the way.<p>I am finding that as my project evolves, I ditch progressively more pieces of web.py.  I ignored the form processing library and custom template library from the start, because plain old web.input() and Cheetah are fine for my uses.  I ditched the DB library after a month or so - a single global DB connection prevented us from unit testing, and will prevent us from replicating or sharding the database.  I'll probably ditch web.py's interface to Cheetah in the near future in favor of precompiled templates (necessary for i18n), at which point I'll just be using the request dispatching features.  May end up ditching those too eventually as we've got our own dispatcher on top of web.py, but for now it provides a useful substrate.<p>That's the main benefit to web.py: it lets you get up-and-running very quickly, with little extra code to weigh you down, so you can <i>see</i> your startup running and adjust from there.  It's basically a prototyping tool.  <p>IMHO, startups should not be using <i>any</i> framework.  The whole point of a framework is to abstract away common usage patterns so you can benefit from what other projects have done before.  The whole point of a startup is to do something <i>new</i> that hasn't been done before.  Once a problem domain has been studied enough to build a useful framework, it's too commodified to make any money off of.  After all, if it was easy for you to build, it'll be easy for a thousand other startups to build.",1180496352

But, I think that the website is imperfect and looking to reddit for inspiration may be helpful.<p>The feature I miss most from reddit is the automatic marking of open links. Looking for new stories on news.yc is tedious. One needs to read each headline and try to recall whether the story is old news. I think that adding this functionality will be easy <p>I also would like the ability to save links. <p>I think that it may be useful to give users the option to display and rank the links they think are most important in their profile.",1180495179

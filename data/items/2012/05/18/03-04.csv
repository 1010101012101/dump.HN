If the school or the state wanted to control the lesson plan content so tightly, they'd design their own plans and foist it on the teachers, which you and I would likely both agree we <i>do not</i> want.<p>2) Even if taxpayers <i>do</i> pay teacher salaries, they do so using local tax revenue for educating students in their respective state and municipality.

While it is true they experienced less of a slowdown that other nations, it's not entirely clear that the stimulus had anything to do with it. A few points:<p>(1) The data (when compared to the recession forecast) doesn't support the idea that household spending is what boosted the economy. Instead, business investment and exports appeared to prop up the Australian economy.<p>(2) The Rudd government didn't try anything (broad stimulus, cash payments, home rebates, auto stimulus) that wasn't tried in the United States. If you believe these things succeeded in AUS, you'd have to have a convincing argument as to why they didn't in the US.<p>Obviously this is a tough nut to crack and there are really too many sourced to cite.

Ajaxified paginated data -><p>With Firebug looking at XHR requests, one can easily reverse engineer the ajax call and extract data directly from the json - in fact you are making the scraper's life easier as you will probably be storing the information in a structured manner in the json string. Or one could use a more sophisticated tool like MITMProxy to study how requests are made.<p>If you somehow managed to implement a highly obfuscated method of ajax requests (re: microsoft aspx.net), there is always selenium to get through them.<p>2. Randomize template output -><p>You are going to annoy users if you are going to display a different template altogether. If its just randomizing div and class ids, one can write clever xpath expressions or css selectors to circumvent this. Or worse case there are always the ever reliable regex expressions.<p>3. HoneyPot -><p>Scrapers only crawl pages that they are specifically looking for. A good scraper only runs through pages he wants to scrape. Nothing more. This is probably the least effective strategy.<p>4. Write data to images on the fly -><p>Use an OCR api to decode them!<p>5. Alternatives -><p>Putting in a login screen is also not effective as not only will that annoy users, it can easily be circumvented by using selenium or passing the cookie/session information to the scraping script.<p>Blacklisting ips is not going to a very effective strategy. With tons of free proxies, Tor and cloud based services (especially PiCloud[2] - which offers a scraping optimized instance!!), ip blocking can easily be circumvented.<p>Best strategy would be display corrupted content or start throwing CAPTCHAs if you sense a large number of requests coming from a particular IP.<p>But once again you may want to do some sort of machine learning on server logs based on the various ips and the specific urls visited and build a model that could predict if a particular user is a bot or a human before you start throwing fake data or captchas.

He called Yahoo the ""worst place in the world to work at"" because of this.  It was incredibly sickening how ridiculous the email was.<p>The employer-employee relationship is a balance.  If it swings too far in one direction where the employees get their ass kissed every day, then you breed self-entitled spoiled brats that are intolerable to work with.  If it swings too far towards the employer, you get a dictatorship.  I've worked in both environments, and neither of them are any good.<p>But to quit because you think that monitors are a litmus test about the engineering culture is ridiculous and is more of a reflection on you than the engineering culture.  If you have a problem, solve it like an adult.  It sounds like the employee didn't even mention it to his boss until he left.  (It also sounds like the boss didn't bother asking the employee at their 1:1's about what they thought needed changing, or maybe he was just unapproachable.)  Maybe it was just an oversight, maybe they didn't have the money, who knows.  Life in general is a lot easier if you're flexible and less of a prima donna and go with the flow.

Is the process of looking for a co-founder the same before you launch (as in you network and meet people in hopes that sparks fly)?  Or have you had experiences where your prototype/beta appeals to developers and they reach out to you, in addition to your regular efforts of finding someone?<p>2.  This question is very specific to developers:  A startup is in a very nascent phase with a prototype/beta launched and no funding. Assuming you liked the idea/product, what would convince you to join the startup?<p>Thanks!",1337311609

The understanding of the intent of the artist which I can achieve when high sometimes carries over to when Im down."" [...]<p>""The heightened sensitivity in all areas gives me a feeling of communion with my surroundings, both animate and inanimate. Sometimes a kind of existential perception of the absurd comes over me and I see with awful certainty the hypocrisies and posturing of myself and my fellow men. And at other times, there is a different sense of the absurd, a playful and whimsical awareness. Both of these senses of the absurd can be communicated, and some of the most rewarding highs Ive had have been in sharing talk and perceptions and humor. Cannabis brings us an awareness that we spend a lifetime being trained to overlook and forget and put out of our minds."" [...]<p>""I find that most of the insights I achieve when high are into social issues, an area of creative scholarship very different from the one I am generally known for.""<p>source: <a href=""http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marijuana-uses.com/mr-x/</a>",1312660747

It is crucial to understand finance. This view was hammered into us repeatedly at the University of Chicago.<p>The seminal paper, by Mr. Larry Summers, on the distinction:
<a href=""http://m.blog.hu/el/eltecon/file/summers_ketchup%5B1%5D.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.blog.hu/el/eltecon/file/summers_ketchup%5B1%5D.pdf</a>
or on jstor ( <a href=""http://www.jstor.org/pss/2327785"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jstor.org/pss/2327785</a> )<p>You need to know how to add. You don't need to know about the well-ordering principle. I say this as a math major who would love it if everyone knew why add works in an integral field( ie. Peano arithmetic:  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_Arithmetic#Arithmetic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_Arithmetic#Arithmetic</a> ).<p>To quote my professor, there's 2 big portions to econ - the narrative portion and the arithmetic portion. The first is mostly storytelling. Granted, there's some consensus around the arc of that story ( more consensus in micro-econ than in macro-econ ), but its still a story. The second completely ignores the story. It just says if debt is what it is, ie. some x, and inflation is y, what should the CDS be priced at ? ie. if CDS = f(x,y) what should that f look like ?<p>Turns out that question is much more useful and actionable than the story-telling aspect. If somebody told you the Dow fell by 500 points, its more useful ( in a utilitarian sense ) to know what you should do with your personal portfolio, than to know the reasons for Dow's fall (assuming that set of reasons are even knowable). You might think the causation would be useful. It is, to a very small extent, but the actionable portion ie. what you must do, can be understood much more efficiently by simply focusing on the prices of individual instruments that characterize market indices, derivatives on those indices, ETFs that make a play on debt, inflation etc. The fact that there were 10,300 puts at 113 strike on the August DIA yesterday is more useful than what any individual economist thinks. It tells you that the short term consensus view of Dow is 113*100 = 11300 ...the trend is down-sloping in the short term.<p>Ironically, Summers said finance guys were mere ketchup economists. The dept. of Ketchup pays ketchup economists huge salaries so they could calculate the price of 2 quarts of ketchup if the market told them the price of 1 quart. Whereas ""real economists"" were engaged in doing research on why a quart of ketchup was priced the way it was ie. due to consumer wages, tomato prices, cost of harvesting tomato, soil conditions etc.<p>Paraphrasing Summers ""Ketchup economists reject research of the ketchup market. They believe prices of ketchup are the only hard data worth studying"". You may not agree with any of this - but I do urge you to read that paper. Its had a huge influence on the asset pricing community.",1312659531

2854699,comment,2854173,2854501,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"This is a concern but it has not been borne out by previous events. One of the challenges (and its a 'good' challenge) is that we don't have a lot of data about what happens when people are exposed to environmental contamination. Primary sources are the post Hiroshima/Nagasaki bombings, testing data from populations in Utah and Nevada who were down wind of the test site. And folks who were exposed in the Bikini islands during testing there.<p>One of the effects of the low number of data points was that latent radiation enhanced cancer deaths which were predicted for folks around Chernobyl didn't actually materialize according to the UN report. Basically the theory is still being developed and their predictions were off (by quite a bit as it turned out).<p>The situation is compounded by the fact that humans have evolved in a 'radiation rich' environment (relatively speaking) with UV skin damage, Radon gas sources, natural radioactivity in the earth, etc. So our bodies have a number of mechanisms which automatically deal with being exposed to radiation. If they did not, getting an x-ray would be a very dangerous thing indeed.<p>So we know you can be killed by an over exposure, and we know pretty accurately what those exposure rates are and yes nobody at Fukushima has had anywhere close to that level of exposure. (not to say someone couldn't walk buck naked into one of the reactor buildings and off themselves, but that is a different issue entirely)<p>And yes, there are radioisotopes in the environment around the plant that have raised the level of radioactive exposure folks living in those zones get. But it is entirely unclear whether or not that will lead to any significant increase in cancer (which is to say distinguishable from other causes).<p>So folks will be watching for elevated cancer rates of course, but if Chernobyl was any indication of what happens post accident they won't find any. Understand that the quantity and distribution of material from the Chernobyl accident still eclipses what non-TEPCO sources (notably the US DoE and the IAEA) have documented from this one by a large amount.<p>Given the Chernobyl results and the relative amounts of radioactive material released, I would be very surprised if there were was a <i>higher</i> elevation in cancer rates in Japan. Lots of economic impact, farmers can't sell food that has become contaminated, but I think the health risks are much lower than the more outspoken coverage would lead you to believe.",1312659154

Unfortunately, the second class of people are more unified and comprise at least a plurality, so they win.<p>The problem with the first camp is that we all want to use different languages-- Haskell, ML, Clojure, Scala. And these are all good languages! But companies can't afford to have more languages than there are people, not as the latter number grows and as being able to read code becomes more important than being able to write it. So every company needs to limit its white list. Those of us who are passionate about good languages nonetheless disagree on which of those good language to use. And we do ourselves a disservice when we bash Python because it sucks compared to Haskell; the result of this disagreement is we end up having to use C++ or Java.<p>The perversion here is that the reason so many companies coerce their codebases to C++ (i.e. limiting the whitelist) is that they recognize the importance of reading code. Yet they choose languages (C++, Java) where reading average (not bad code, mind you, but 50th-percentile code in a production system) code is extremely difficult. A good C++ programmer can write eventually comprehensible, but not beautiful code; a bad or average one can easily make an illegible and unmaintainable mess. For contrast, a good ML programmer can write beautiful, easy-to-read code while bad ML programmers are practically non-existent because they can't get their code to compile. For bad programmers, ML is that evil little language that caused them to nearly flunk that PL course they had to take in college.<p>What I wonder is how Yahoo managed to get people of sufficient talent to do the project. It seems like one of those hard-but-shitty projects that never succeeds because the people who are competent enough to do it have better options. Do-the-same-thing rewrites are never popular projects, and most people who understand Lisp are not going to be happy about taking on such a project for the sake of C++.<p>(No, I'm not saying that there aren't good programmers who use C++. There are great programmers who use C++.

2854656,comment,2851470,2851797,2,0,justin_vanw,,,"I don't know the answer, but I can see it as being something like:<p>In 1100's europe, there was land that was cleared for cultivation and forest.  Most land holdings had areas of wilderness.  They cleared it as the population increased.  If the landholder could have instantly increased the population, he would have put the new people to work clearing land and planting crops (probably via leasing it to them as a landlord, or some kind of serfdom, but the mechanics of that don't matter here).  So, the number of 'jobs' available on a given landholders property might have been 5000, while the population at the time was 400.  There were more job openings than there were people.<p>Later, factories pulled population away from farms and improved farming allowed the land to feed more people than actually lived on it.  This reduced the number of farmers needed as a proportion of the population, so if the population were the same as in 1100, the 5000 jobs we had before might have dropped, perhaps to 2000 jobs, or rather, food prices would have dropped so that lots of people no longer saw farming as the best idea.  However, the population had increased greatly.  My hypothesis here is that the number of jobs that could have been productively filled was still higher than the population.<p>This process can't continue forever.  Sooner or later, the number of jobs simply crosses over the number of people looking for work.  In history, I can imagine a leader, seeing lots of able bodied, desperate, and incredibly cheap manpower seeing an opportunity to raise an army and attempting to expand their own wealth by expanding their lands.  That was a natural brake on the population line.  Today, thankfully, we don't have any mechanisms that drastically reduce the population whenever people get desperate, there isn't wide areas of undeveloped land that can absorb as many people as we have over above the jobs line, and technology continues to increase productivity at a respectable rate.<p>So that is how I explain why the jobs line can cross over the population line now, and why we may now be in a situation where we might expect to have less jobs than people who want jobs for a long time.",1312658095

I have some ideas but I'm looking for some additional ideas on what could be done with a domain like this.<p>Obviously the financial problem is a huge one and decisions need to be made from the top down but I still believe there must be things that we as citizens can do to work towards a long term solution.<p>I'll take the feedback I get and try and put something simple together tomorrow.<p>Thanks",1312657841

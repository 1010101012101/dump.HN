2224722,comment,2224177,2224675,0,0,akashs,,,"And for those who don't need the help with payment,  distribution, etc Apple is forcing them to take it.  Do you think Amazon really needs Apple's help in processing or distributing any of their content?  I'm pretty sure the WSJ has plenty of experience handling payments as well.<p>I paid several hundred dollars for my iPad, and for that price I'd like to do whatever I want with it and be able to take advantage of the greatest things people have built for it, not what Apple approves of being done.  The issue I have is that Apple's feeling of entitlement inherently blocks out many incredible things from that iPad.  E.g., I bought a bunch of books on the Kindle app so I could read them on any device.  Apple could have done the same by getting off their asses and building iBooks for other devices, but they chose not to.  And now that advantage of Kindle is gone because Apple wants to take every last dime from anyone doing anything on an iOS device?  Many business models cannot survive having to give up 30% of revenues.  It is a poor model.<p>Edit: I guess I wouldn't have an issue if there was an alternative way to get native stuff onto your device other than Apple's app store.  But there isn't.",1297825116

The technical side is fairly easy, and many people could do it. Our value is built on the non-technical stuff, which relies on a network of people and resources that have taken years to develop. We've also done our homework, discreetly, so we really aren't worried about having to pivot dramatically on day one or about not being able to handle running costs for long enough to establish the product.<p>The biggest risk in our business plan is that we are relying to some extent on time over money, because we're self-funded. We know of no-one making a similar product to us, but there are businesses making other kinds of products that would naturally compete for the same money from the same customers, which makes us mutual threats. If one of them heard what we were planning, they could throw way more money than we currently have into moving sideways, and potentially sabotage our network before we reach critical mass, even if they didn't then establish an equivalent product themselves.<p>Given the nature of the markets involved, there is a very real prospect of that happening.

I actually wrote a paper on this called ""The Paradox of Power and Defining Good and Evil in The Lord of the Rings.""<p>Tolkein grew up largely in and around Birmingham, which likely gave him a mix of good decent country folk (farmers) and the powerfully rich city folk (given Birmingham has largely been Englands second biggest city and for a long time - IIRC the 70's is when this ended - it had the highest household income, even exceeding London).<p>He likely got a first hand look at the corruption of the powerful and the earnestness of country folk.",1297824812

Some of the big ones:<p>- The sales metrics used (CPM, CPC) have caused a numbers driven approach which favours shitty content farms and dilutes the value of quality human-driven sites and blogs.<p>- It seems like ad creators are always coming up with new ways to annoy end users (ie. big Flash pop-ups, sound, etc). The level of user tracking also presents privacy concerns.<p>- Smaller ad buyers rarely get to choose <i>which site</i> their ad will be placed on - instead, it is usually based on certain target keywords. This is not always the best option for advertisers.<p>http://www.adfrenzy.net is a really simple project I've started which attempts to address these problems. I've been working on this in my spare time over the last couple of months, and now that it's ready to show people I'm hoping to get an idea of whether or not to keep working on it. Please be extremely critical of both the idea and its implementation - compliments are nice and appreciated but I'd rather get some tough love. (There are many things I plan to improve in the next little bit but your feedback will help me determine which order to take. Also, right now it is best suited to somewhat self-serving industries like ours because the only way to buy ads is directly from the site you saw it on. I plan to start building out the other side of that equation - helping advertisers find the right ad spaces - if there is an interest.)",1297823351

Do whatever you want to do as long as it doesn't impose on others.<p>The ""racism"" probably comes from description of the black riders, but black describes their clothes; on Weathertop, for example, when Frodo can briefly see the other side because he's wearing the ring, they're described as white. White and black are chiefly used as synonyms for light and dark, as in the day and the night.<p><i>how good a person is, is pretty much determined by his birthplace and pedigree.</i><p>Given Saruman's pedigree (a powerful spirit from Valinor) and Sauron's (another Maiar), this is somewhat odd; the nominally highborn often behave badly (Saruman, Sauron, Boromir), while those of low birth (all the hobbits) often do quite well. Notice too that Aragorn and the other characters are scrupulous about the limits to their power. I actually wrote a paper on this called ""The Paradox of Power and Defining Good and Evil in The Lord of the Rings.""",1297821608

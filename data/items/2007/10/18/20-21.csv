69898,comment,69841,69881,0,0,veritas,,,"So if it isn't the users and it isn't the revenue, then Facebook's insane valuations are the product of... hype?<p>Valuations aside, you're right in saying what really matters is monetization and this is where Google shines.  I don't care how much information Facebook has about me, I don't go onto Facebook looking to buy things.  I go there to see what's going on in my friends' lives.  As the article states, ads on Facebook are an annoyance.<p>Google's in the right market for targeted ads because when we're looking to buy something, we're more open to advertisements and clicking on them.  On Facebook, I'd guess that very few, if any, are looking to buy something (and hence Facebook's abysmal click-through rate).  <p>Also, I can't see users leaving Facebook (eventually the time sunk into building connections just entrenches you into the network), but I hope it figures out something quickly, or these valuations might drop.",1192740374

It's merely an illusion that plays with your depth perception from lack of contrast and depth cues (motion parallax maybe, if you're so inclined).<p>I believe this is the <i>original</i> source of the image.\n<a href=""http://www.procreo.jp/labo/labo13.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.procreo.jp/labo/labo13.html</a>\nThe author says nothing beyond it being a mysterious illusion.<p>The switching is as arbitrary as the coriolis effect. Try this thought experiment. Imagine instead of a woman, there was a perfect, black, sphere in the image. You couldn't tell if it was rotating at all. Now I add a protrusion to the ""equator."" Its length would vary in a sinusoidal fashion, and you could guess the ball is rotating, but still cannot reason it's direction. I can then successfully add protrusions such that it looks like a human and you wouldn't be able to tell; it's a simple lack of visual cues.<p>edit: my bad, not the coriolis effect. I was referring to the toilet-draining direction that is incorrectly attributed to the effect. The point is, given a little push in one direction, the water, or the image, would continue to rotate in that direction.",1192740243

69893,comment,69798,69869,0,0,dcurtis,,,"It isn't really debunked. But this method of saying which side is ""dominant"" is. Each eye's information is sent to the opposite hemisphere (edit: as well as the corresponding hemisphere), so the idea is that if you see it moving left, your right hemisphere is processing the information first, then your left hemisphere. <p>But there is absolutely no conclusive evidence to suggest this is true, and to show these kinds of things on The Daily Telegraph is a pretty big disservice to teaching people about neuroscience, I think.<p>This doesn't mean there aren't differences in the hemispheres, but just that visual tricks like this are probably not accurate at all for determining hemisphere dominance (if such a thing exists).",1192740195

That graph in the middle of the article is a pretty sick demonstration that MySpace is <i>dominating</i> this game. And yet, nobody's trying to buy it off of News Corp. Valleywag's claimed that Rupert Murdoch is a lot more excited about Facebook than his own purchase. As is the rest of Silicon Valley, hence the valuations that have nothing to do with the user numbers. Or the yearly revenue...<p>The thing that is most similar between (post-IPO) Google and Facebook is the immense, almost unbelievably universal goodwill held about the company by the public. Goodwill's not actually worth much money in and of itself, but if the entire world wants Facebook to make money, it eventually will. Let's hope that happens before the users leave.",1192739123

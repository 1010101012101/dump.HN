It is >= 8, since you surely have to remove 4 As and insert 4 Bs. Since these 8 transformations indeed transform AAAA into BBBB, it is exactly 8.<p>It is very easy to generalize the Wagner-Fisher algorithm (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner%E2%80%93Fischer_algorit...</a>) to this &quot;simpler&quot; variant of edit distance, but this algorithm will still have a (worst-case) runtime of O(m*n), where m, n are the lengths of the two strings.<p>Of course, the question remains: Is there a (worst-case) faster algorithm?",1439294385

Oracle&#x27;s enterprise calendaring program was totally inadequate and had UX that made most point-of-sale systems look effortless by contrast.  Also, the assets managing app, Sunflower, was another dud.  The only thing Oracle Database had going for it was no crippling license activation (license scofflaws are/were sued or fined into oblivion worse than M$FT), which one could say was equivalent to MS SQL.  Unlike MS MSQL, Oracle DBMS has/had bazillions of support patches to apply to run a real production box, analogous to the previously separate Sun&#x27;s Solaris patchsets.<p>Btw: For smaller enterprisey shops, either MS SQL or Postgres are the way to go.  Often multiple similar components are needed because different apps have firm requirements that only support one or another; but generally try to avoid this because supporting too many heterogenous components is expensive (laborious)... hence the prevalence of local &quot;standards.&quot;  Deploying everything with cfengine3 or puppet can help reduce the manualness and nudge vendors into repeatable, idempotent deployments rather than clicking on inane GUI installers like an animal.<p>ProTip: Don&#x27;t let consultants &quot;provide&quot; oversight / free-reign for their own projects, budgets, etc., that&#x27;s like the wolf guarding the henhouse.  The client must hire their own project managers, have clear accountability/authority paths to their management and know exactly what they need (avoid endless upselling).

Each folder inside the source/Overture/ directory is really a separate module. The dependency information between the modules is already in the files so that the build tool orders them correctly, so it would be a small extension to make it only include the modules you want + dependencies.<p>Basically, the library is perfect for us (and we think it&#x27;s pretty neat; our web app is one of the largest, most complex and fastest out there, and the codebase is very clean). But we totally understand that the lack of more documentation, examples (or even books, tutorials and seminars!) compared to the popular libraries makes it harder for people to get into.

When it was revealed that smart TVs phoned home with detailed viewing information, including filenames, I remember making a similar comment - if they had used TLS, that discovery might not have occurred.<p>The ability to MITM your own devices is very important, if only so you can figure out exactly what they&#x27;re sending out.<p>Another thing is the widespread use of enforced code signing, accompanied by pinning to specific (e.g. MS) CAs; if this had happened a decade or more ago, it would&#x27;ve been pretty easy to pinpoint the parts of the OS responsible and just patch them out. Now the same thing is likely still possible (theoretically, as long as you can change any byte on the disk it is), but involves plenty of bypassing other protection mechanisms on the way and could get pretty hairy if hardware is involved (e.g. secure boot/TPM.) From this perspective, remote attestation and the other upcoming security technologies are immensely disturbing. The desktop PC ecosystem is gradually being locked-down in the same way that mobile is.<p>These security mechanisms certainly have benefits, but their goal is ensuring that your software is completely unchanged from what the author wants you to have; in situations like these, that is precisely what you <i>don&#x27;t</i> want. Nevertheless, I hope the hackers/crackers out there find a solution so those that are forced to use Win10 can still retain some privacy.",1439293309

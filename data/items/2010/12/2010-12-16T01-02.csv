It's difficult to do this job well enough to satisfy the studios that the studios' Claw can reach into livingrooms and control what people do with their movies. This difficulty is the barrier-to-entry that makes Netflix's growth possible, and makes the cut they can demand of the studios large enough to be worth their while.<p>> Make no mistake, if you work for Netflix, you will be primarily collaborating in this project. Nothing else is bottom-line.<p>> That's what makes all these comments seem so silly to me. While a prospective customer might be using Linux because it's $0, or because he likes to rice out his peecee and tinker, or because he has some Media Box that works well in the living room and requires Linux, none of these are the reasons a desireable geek would give for using Linux.<p>> The smartest geeks---the ones you want as employees---use Linux because they want software freedom. That's why I use it. This freedom has been critical to my professional development, as well as my sense of individual empowerment in the world. And it's largely a desire for this empowerment that drove me into this field to begin with.<p>> A Linux Netflix client is certainly very possible, but software freedom will never be compatible with DRM, because if you really had software freedom, the first thing a rational person would do with it would be to remove all the DRM! Yes, a Linux client may some day exist, but a client with software freedom---the only kind of client that's interesting to the smart geeks Netflix should want to hire---can never exist. It's fundamentally impossible.<p>> It's my sincere hope that this impossibile gap between the true ideals of software freedom and Netflix's core business will limit their applicant pool to dizzy-headed second-rate developers. It's really shocking to me to see Netflix trolling for hires by dangling a penguin cape when their entire business is fundamentally about red-cape Digital Restrictions Management unfreedom.",1292464706

2010810,comment,2010277,2010277,0,0,dkarl,,,"Best reason:  going home at 6 o'clock and rarely getting called on nights and weekends unless you volunteer for it.<p><i>1. You learn an awful lot. You get to see the good, the bad and the ugly. You see lots of very good ideas (like proper source control) and some not so good ideas (like how not to motivate people).</i><p>For good ideas, I think this depends on what you mean by ""large.""  A small company company that has been around for a long time, and possibly grown into a medium- or large-sized company during that time, acquires a high level of expertise in its particular problems.  It's really an education to see the technical solutions that emerge from years of accumulated experience in that kind of environment.  However, after companies get really large, they devolve back towards mediocrity, because the prevailing management mentality is that technical excellence does not scale.  Executives four or five levels away from the front lines want to feel in control.  If they aren't in control, nobody is in control.  If nobody is control, the company drifts aimlessly.  And the executives aren't in control unless the people on the front lines are predictable and interchangeable.  There's a flaw in that logic, but it's natural for executives to feel that way.  Technical excellence (except in the empty sense that everyone claims) also means that management can't solve technical problems by itself, because management's only methods for solving technical problems are managerial:  ramp up hiring, hire contractors, outsource, etc.  Empowering management means organizing the company around the most common technologies, the most common practices, and the most common quality of developer.  From that point of view, technical mediocrity is a feature, not a bug.  There's no need to learn mediocrity first-hand:  you can learn it from books and blogs, and from there you will quickly match or exceed it.<p>For bad ideas, I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't think there's much benefit to seeing ideas fail.  Some things are obviously good or bad, and some things you need to see play out in practice, but in my opinion, the non-obvious things you need to see play out in practice are usually sensitive to context and specifics.  They might work poorly in a large company but well in a small company, or poorly in one large company and well in another large company.  Scrum, for instance, turns out to be a poor fit (in my opinion) for the engineering department I work in.  If I try to predict whether Scrum will or won't work in another situation, however, I will fall back on common sense unless there are particular parallels to the situation I observed.<p><i>2. You get to work with lots of clever people.</i><p>Surprisingly true, probably because of the exact reasons he stated.  However, the better the tech economy, the more the best people feel confident leaving.<p><i>4. They have lots of perks. I do miss the canteen, the sports gym and the other 'extras'. And that week's 'training' in Amsterdam at the company's expense. That was a lot of fun!</i><p>Not always true.  Many big companies have no perks at all, or insultingly crappy ones.  Mine won't even provide decent coffee -- we have a bunch of coffee fiends who simply don't drink coffee at work.  It's better to have a coffee house nearby than to have a company canteen.  (Also keep in mind that if you're a lower-level resource, big companies may compensate for lax productivity standards by paying more attention to when you're in the office, which makes it a bad idea to go out for coffee on a regular basis.)<p>As for training, that depends, too.  Sometimes big companies won't pay for any training except overpriced training in proprietary software, and then only one or two people get it.  You can encounter cases where the company will only pay for (e.g.) introductory Oracle training, but will only pay for training for its most senior resources.  The introductory training isn't offered to junior resources, and the company won't pay for advanced training for the senior resources, so nobody ever gets trained.  (And you'll never know whether this is on purpose, or simply due to stupidity.)  I was going to get flown to expensive official SAP training halfway across the country, but then (thank God) I managed to avoid working with SAP.  Result?  No training of any kind for me, even if it's half the price.  Unless I want to get a Master's degree, that is, in which case I have a lot of leeway.  It seems ridiculous that the company will pay for a Master's degree but won't shell out a thousand bucks for a conference, but apparently that's not unusual.  The rules are often bizarre and counterproductive.",1292464657

2010804,comment,2010764,2010764,0,0,charliepark,,,"There are a number of things that banks can do to increase customers' faith in them, or to abuse that trust. Personally, trollface references don't affect my confidence in the bank's ability to protect my money. Things like conning mortgage applicants to take on loans that they could never possibly repay, or buying and selling CDOs and other shady financial instruments? Drops my confidence in that bank like a stone. That's not what BankSimple's doing here.<p>I appreciate that BankSimple is a humane organization. I imagine that once they launch and start growing, there'll be hierarchies and levels of bureaucracy that will rise up and that will affect how they're able to relate to their users. But, honestly, trollface references don't bother me.<p>So ... if I prefer humane organizations, why not go with a local bank? A quick story. I had an account with a local bank, opened by necessity when I got a mortgage with that bank. When we refinanced the mortgage elsewhere, I went in to the teller to close the account. She gave me a long-winded song-and-dance about how they could surely meet my banking needs and so on, and wouldn't I like to schedule a meeting to go over how they could best serve me? I replied that, no, I'd like to close the account. ""Where will you store your money?"" ""I'm planning on putting it into an online bank."" She then goes into another long-winded spiel about how important it is to be able to look people in the eye, and ... these are her words: ""I really just could never bring myself to trust mister cyber-face.""<p>All other things being equal (and I doubt that'd be the case), I'd much rather bank with someone who knows about trollface than with someone who references online banking as ""mister cyber-face.""",1292464565

2010730,comment,2009970,2010270,0,0,A1kmm,,,"It depends on what your objectives are. If they are to ensure that no single legal jurisdiction can force a domain that has already been issued to stop working by taking actions in that jurisdiction (except via the domain owner), that is easily achievable without major problems.<p>E.g. the system could have the following components:<p>1) A centralised issuer (CI) of time-stamped certificates for a TLD, which certify someone is the owner of a domain. Certificates are only issued for domains that don't exist yet. The public key is in the certificate, and the private key is kept by the owner.<p>2) A network of TLD nameserver operators (TLDNSO) for the TLD. TLDNSOs have stable IP addresses which are distributed to client software in advance - and there is a centrally agreed on list. TLDNSOs are geographically dispersed, and spread across many different legal jurisdictions.<p>3) All certificates from the CI are sent to all TLDNSOs. Certificates without a timestamp that corresponds within a limited threshold to the time the certificate was received are rejected, as are certificates for domains when another certificate for the same domain is held by the TLDNSO.<p>4) TLDNSOs accept domain resource record (RR) updates - e.g. nameserver records - from anyone, provide they are signed with the private key that only the domain owner has. Likewise for the equivalent of WHOIS details.<p>5) Domain owners can sign a transfer certificate, which includes the public key of the new owner, and is signed with their private key, and sending the transfer certificate to the new owner. The new owner sends it to all TLDNSOs, who will from then on accept requests with the new owner's key, rather than the old one.<p>6) Clients can query TLDNSOs using DNS or DNSSEC, or using a new protocol which lets them inspect the certificates from the CI and any ownership changes. Clients using the new protocol query several TLDNSOs in several jurisdictions - there could be a fairly complex set of conflict resolution rules, but one of the most important would be that if two CI certificates were received, more TLDNSOs get queried, and the most frequent answer is the one that is accepted.<p>This makes most kinds of attacks on existing domains difficult:<p>1) The CI can be compelled by authorities in its jurisdiction to issue certificates, possibly backdated, but they won't be accepted by TLDNSOs except the ones that can be compelled to accept them (a minority in the case of unilateral government action), because they already have a certificate for the domain. The new CI certificate will be rejected by clients if only a minority of TLDNSOs present it.<p>2) TLDNSOs can be compelled to remove CI certificates for individual domains, but if only a minority are in any one jurisdiction, clients will get the record from other TLDNSOs.<p>3) Only the domain name owner has the private key needed to revoke or transfer a domain name. Obviously, the domain name owner can be compelled to reveal they private key (if they have it in that jurisdiction anyway), but that is outside the scope of this document. They could encrypt the key with a secure password and refuse to disclose it - that would be legal in some jurisdictions and illegal in others. By this point, authorities would probably focus on taking down the servers hosting the website rather than the DNS.",1292462939

I don't have the time to do the probability distributions out, if someone cares would they do the calculation and check?<p>EDIT: The salt 'sV' occurred 215 times. sV39Fw5at18zo occurs seven times. Assuming that there were only 300 possible passwords each of which occurred with probability ~.3% (the probability of '123456'), then the probability of seven passwords hashing to the same value is incredibly low. Less than a thousandth of one percent. Does anyone know why this is? Or was it just the case that Scorpion's assumption that the distribution is very non-random is correct?",1292461675

If you can add some blog content or articles that throw light on your business model or experience, it can be a good resource.<p>For regular readers, I usually flag sales posts, but I upvoted this one in the light of last week's interesting discussion about web design for $15 (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1983141"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1983141</a>). Some posters argued against pricing too low (like me), some argued that being undercut at $14, $13 etc., was not a problem worth worrying about. Although it's not exactly the same service, and I agree there is 'room at the bottom,' so to speak, the low-budget design market is going to be increasingly crowded. We didn't have to wait very long for a random example at an even lower price point of $10. Think it over when setting your pricing strategy.",1292461605

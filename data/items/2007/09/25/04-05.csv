Now I have an overlay window occupying the center of my screen, with no way to get rid of it save by entering the aforementioned info. That's annoying.<p>Now that that's out of the way, one question: Will people actually pay for this? I mean, pretty much the only time I read a print magazine is if I'm really bored at the airport. Otherwise, the Web is all I need.",1190696146

A social networking site webmaster would use your service to offer their users the ability to drag n drop functionality on their page. You would make it easy for the webmaster to create ""widgets"" that can be added/removed. Basically iGoogle for any site that wants it but doesn't want to get involved in the hairy mess of making a solid and reliable drag n drop interface.<p>",1190695504

LOTS of references, and make sure they check out!",1190695289
59288,comment,59248,59248,0,0,uuilly,,,"The long tail for magazines?  Sounds cool but I'm worried about a contradiction...  Yes the market for tree based magazines is still HUGELY HUGE and you could make a lot of money creating lots of special interest mags the big guys ignore.  But...  If your audience is web-savy enough to discover your service, they probably get most of their news from the web and they don't care about magazines.  <p>Your ideal customer would be web-savy but their end subscribers would not be.  I'm too absorbed in the www to imagine who that may be, but I'm sure they're out there.  On news.yc though, you'll probably get a bunch of people saying ""why not just read a blog?""<p>\nGodspeed.\n",1190695263

The truth is--the <i>problem</i> such as it is, genuinely existed through almost all of history up until the middle of the 20th century. The problem was solved, and It's all but gone now. <p>The poor are largely poor because of themselves and not circumstances.

59285,story,,,6,7,staunch,"Ask News.YC: Should You Implement Your Business Model at Launch? Joe Kraus vs Paul Graham",,"Any time two people who know a ton about startups seem to differ there's something interesting to think about.<p>Joe Kraus> Put your business model into beta when you put your product into beta.<p>Paul Graham> The reason we tell founders not to worry about the business model initially is that making something people want is so much harder.<p>I've run into this myself. With my new project advertising is a hassle to manage, so much so that I've considered not having ads at all at first. I'm concerned that not having ads initially and then adding them later would result in users feeling as though I used bait and switch to trick them.<p>It seems to me that if your business model impacts the product directly it may be necessary to implement it at launch. I think that's what I have to do at least.\n",1190694456

Are there books you suggest i read, or tutorials to start with? ...""</i><p>I'd suggest trying to change your <i>""mindset""</i> as well, building and reading  supporting information at the same time. One such way is to read ""SEIA"" (Software Engineering for Internet Applications, Andersson, Greenspun & Grumet) which is online or in print and follow the book through ~ <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/</a><p>The book/course is easy to read and most important devoid of advocacy. The good thing is you can start now at no real cost. But it will take time and effort though.\n",1190694223

Seriously, it's really hard to overstate how valuable this is.<p>However, a lot of companies that post jobs at UW also post them online. RIM for example hires hundreds of students from UW every term and their entire application process is online so you're probably not at a disadvantage there. Microsoft has their recruiting sessions here every few days it seems, so just attend one of those and hand out your resume. Now that Google has a branch in town just attend one of their sessions too.<p>If you're specifically looking to work for a startup, your best bet is to look up companies in the Accelerator Center (north campus, in the Research and Technology park.) There are about 15 startups there now. Terrapath and SuitedMedia are on a hiring binge, so just walk in there and talk to the president, you'll probably have a job on the spot. Don't be afraid, the guys there are all only a few years older than you, so don't feel intimidated at the prospect of just coming in and talking to the boss :)",1190693695

It seems novel enough to be worth a try.<p>That being said, I'm not sure how easy it will be to translate blog posts into print in a way that's visually appealing. A lot of bloggers are big into using whitespace, which would look pretty weird in a print medium. And often there is meaning conveyed by the whitespace itself, so it's not necessarily easy to reformat posts into nice paragraphs. ",1190693589

They also happen to be recruiting people from my university, and they are in a situation I will be on the other side of in a few months time. The fact that I am in Waterloo is relevant not because I want this specific internship (heck, I don't even know what it is), but because I am interested in the area's job market.

I have tried to establish some testing procedures in the labs I have been in the past, where even backing up data was a myth, with zero success. With the requirement to compile code in four different OSs, testing and some automated procedure was the key, but not one person came on board.<p>Now moving to a diagnostic setting, and working by myself, testing and documentation have been the main goals to me. And now, every single piece of third-party software has to be exhaustively validated in every aspect before being put into production mode.<p>&quot;I&#x27;d love to see science funding agencies spend a couple million to fund reasonably sized groups of 5-10 programmers/scientists to produce code over ~3 year funding cycles. Just to make sure that signals don&#x27;t get crossed, these groups should be told not to spend a single minute of their time on publishing to journals. Dissemination is limited to short talks and training workshops. Continued funding would also focus more heavily on user surveys than third-party citations.&quot;<p>On the side of software/funding, your ideas are spot on. I think it is about time to have professional and steady funding to keep software working and available. I haven&#x27;t published app notes or the like in the past, most of the software I worked on were never published, but I see important applications where the code is not open source, there&#x27;s no testing and no updates for years. We need to move from the on-the-clock science to some model that would allow scientific software to be properly maintained.<p>Maybe if we treated scientific software like we treat &quot;regular IT&quot;, might be the key.",1419616792

The process includes a timed puzzle-solving test.<p>Ironically, fresh CS grads are more likely to do better on such a test because senior devs have filled their minds with ways of solving real problems and building complex living systems that actual humans use. They know that the once or twice a year they need to solve such a problem, they will likely find it well-solved in a library or site like this one. If not, they know that the boss will not be holding a stop watch over them -- she measures productivity in person-months, not person-minutes.<p>Even more ironically, this particular test also rewards premature optimization by stress testing your solutions for micro-optimization.",1419616617

The field of study is called &quot;textual criticism&quot;.  I can&#x27;t do it justice in a single Hacker News comment, but you can find fairly substantial scholarly books and articles on the subject.<p>When it comes to the New Testament, one of the keys for analysis is the multitude of spread-out manuscripts.  They have subtle differences from each other, like spelling mistakes (which help us trace lineage -- the same spelling error often appears in later copies from the same source), but the core stories are extremely well preserved -- not changing from early to late manuscripts, or from region to region.<p>It&#x27;s also worth reading through the other writings of the early church, from the first 2 centuries, which extensively quote/reference those same accounts.<p>The sum total of the evidence is that the current version of the Biblical accounts of who Jesus was were written within about 30 years of his death and well-preserved from that time period onward.<p>(There&#x27;s also what we call &quot;higher criticism&quot;, which looks at how the contents of the text correspond to known history etc.  That also establishes the gospels as written ~30 years after Jesus&#x27; death.  My favorite oddball data: statistical distributions of the names in the gospels compared to names uncovered in archaeological digs -- the common names are correct for first century Palestinian Jews, not Egyptian or Greek Jews.)<p>There are definitely leaps of faith involved in Christianity.  &quot;Does my book of Matthew match the first century book of Matthew?&quot; is not one of them.",1419616501

There&#x27;s a tradeoff here, and it&#x27;s more than a cliche in this particular case.<p>The same argument would imply that you shouldn&#x27;t do computing on VPSes or similar services that other people own. This might be strictly true, but the alternative for lots of people is that they just won&#x27;t be doing that computing. At least with free software, we can say that it&#x27;s usually monetarily cheaper than proprietary software. Buying and running your own server is much more expensive than running an EC2 box for pennies per hour. A lot of people&#x27;s first introduction to free operating systems, these days, tends to be on a remote server instead of their personal computer. I don&#x27;t think we should halt that.<p>The same argument would imply that you shouldn&#x27;t use the email or shell account from your university, and you should self-host. While I actually do believe that to some extent, I get the feeling that Richard doesn&#x27;t.<p>And even if you do end up self-hosting everything, chances are you won&#x27;t be responding to security issues as quickly as a full-time team of professionals on call. At that point, anyone who wants to take your freedom can do so.

The other three are more like &quot;come along for the journey&quot; -- they walk you through the process of the disciples coming to understand Jesus.  There are divinity claims all over those gospels, but they&#x27;re more subtle.<p>For example, early in the gospel of Matthew, Jesus quotes the Old Testament saying &quot;You are to worship the Lord your God and serve only him.&quot;  At the very end of Matthew, Jesus meets the disciples, who worship him, and he does not criticize them or stop them (contrast with Peter in Acts 10.)  Once that connection is made, it&#x27;s an <i>obvious</i> divinity claim -- but it&#x27;s one that might take time to realize is there.<p>A few other examples: Psalm 103 says the Lord &quot;is the one who forgives all your sins&quot;; Jesus does it in Mark 2.  Both Isaiah 43 and Hosea 13 specify that God alone is Savior, and Luke 1:47 repeats it just prior to calling Jesus the Savior in Luke 2:11.  Deuteronomy 10 establishes heaven as entirely God&#x27;s property, but Jesus claims to be the one controlling entry to heaven in Matthew 7.<p>Given Jesus&#x27; obviously strong knowledge of the Hebrew scriptures, it&#x27;s hard to get away from the conclusion that he was making <i>intentional</i> claims of being God.",1419615473

If someone invented a VCS that completely revolutionized the process (I really don&#x27;t know how it could, but just hypothetically), then it could serve as true competition to Git.<p>This is one reason why D has failed to really take off. Both D and Rust are looking to essentially take C++&#x27;s place. D is C++ improved, while Rust changes the whole model of managing memory and also introduces some new paradigms (more type inference, pattern matching, etc.). D is clearly better than C++, but the two are just similar enough to make C++ a more preferable choice due to its immense popularity compared to D. Rust changes just enough to give it a chance at being a serious contender: the value may be higher than the cost of leaving C++ for many people.<p>The same applies to Git (C++) and Mercurial (D). Perhaps even more so, because while Git isn&#x27;t perfect it generally &quot;just works&quot; for almost all use cases; Mercurial is just some simplicity and elegance on top of some workflows (which are sometimes emulated with wrappers over Git, like Legit).

I don&#x27;t disagree with any of the details, but I can&#x27;t really get behind the idea that NIH plays a significant role in the failures.<p>You can probably dig into the project and pick out thousands or tens of thousands of objective mistakes that someone somewhere is capable of diagnosing and proposing a better solution.  And on the same token you can probably do that same for good decisions which someone somewhere <i>thinks</i> would have thought they knew better and attempted to fix what wasn&#x27;t broken.<p>This is just the nature of large projects, and well understood in such literature as The Mythical Man Month.  And I would submit that it&#x27;s not technology projects per se, but rather the unforgiving literalness of computer systems that throws the overall systemic failure into stark relief.<p>As the scope and required knowledge of a project increases, the communication overhead increases non-linearly.  Not only must thousands of leaders at every level have access to the right information and make good decisions, they in effect act as a distributed system to specify the technical implementation.  It will be extremely difficult, if not impossible for all the subordinates to filter the information correctly such that the people at the very top have exactly the right information to make the best decisions.<p>The reason a couple college kids end up creating something more impressive is because they have the freedom to ignore intractable problems.  If you threw Larry and Sergey at this type of problem they would be nobodies today because there&#x27;s nothing you can do against that wall of legislation.  The legal code is like computer code that is never subject to performance benchmarks, the people who touch it (legislators, judges, lawyers) are all well paid and have exactly zero incentive to make it efficient.  It&#x27;s tragic because there are no doubt places where 8-figures could be shaved off the budget if the implementers had channels to the legislators to raise issues that make the system intractable, but unfortunately the legal requirements are done in a too-big-to-fail waterfall fashion where the hopes of ever simplifying the system are slim to none.",1419613870

Nim&#x27;s enum [1] is an old-school typesafe enum, as in Ada, without any fields. To avoid name clashes, it&#x27;s common to prefix the enum values with a two-letter abbreviation. The case part in the object declaration introduces a checked union. So the access of f.name will raise an exception if f.kind != fkVar.<p>[1] <a href=""http://goran.krampe.se/2014/10/20/i-missed-nim/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://goran.krampe.se/2014/10/20/i-missed-nim/</a>",1419613390

My parents kept it and I was planning to have my kids use it, only to find out a few years ago that none of the motors work anymore, and a lot of the plastic has become brittle, so breaks easily when taking things apart. <i>sigh</i>",1419613351

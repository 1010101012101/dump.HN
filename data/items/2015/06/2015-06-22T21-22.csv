But there is no reason to think qualia is a) present in other brains except your own, but b) not present in any non-brain information processing system. Philosophers of mind have tried to make that argument, but end up appealing to intuition.<p>In terms of computability, folks like Boden and Sloman showed in the 90s that emotion is compatible with computability. Even more so, that emotion is implementable in symbolic computation. Of course, one could declare such systems have no qualia of emotion. But can you do more than declare that, while not simultaneously creating arguments that could apply to other brains?<p>I get you are working on intuition.

[3]<p>The LXC project in development since 2009 on which Docker was based, and now Systemd-nspawn give you pretty advanced OS containers with mature management tools, full stack linux networking, multiple storage options including support for btrfs, zfs, LVM, Overlayfs, cloning, snapshotting and a wide choice of container OS templates.<p>It also offers unprivileged containers that let&#x27;s non root users run containers, which is a big step forward for container security, and is currently working on live migration of containers.<p>Docker takes that as a base, limits the container OS template to a single app, builds the containers with layers of aufs and enforces storage separation. [4] It&#x27;s not rocket science, you can do this yourself with overlayfs and LXC in minutes. [5]<p>Docker is an opinionated way to use containers. You don&#x27;t need to adopt Docker to get the benefits of containers. You adopt Docker to get the benefits of Docker. A lot of the messaging, hype and marketing conflates the 2 and it suits the docker ecosystem to do that but it does not benefit informed discussion.<p>Nspawn is a systemd container project, which is similar to LXC in that it gives you OS containers, not layered single app containers.

I&#x27;m afraid I disagree, the opposite is the case. Modern PL theory is  mostly about program correctness, and that is much easier for pure functional languages. Until recently, nobody had a handle on program logics for imperative languages, or reasoning techniques for operational semantics. The only available reasoning techniques used to be based on denotational semantics, following Scott&#x27;s breakthrough domain-theoretic semantics of lambda-calculus. That&#x27;s why so much theory was developed in a functional programming context, because FP is in some ways much simpler than imperative or concurrent programming (even though compiling FP languages is harder). The available textbooks reflect this state of afairs.<p>All that has changed in the last decade or so, but it will take another decade or so before recent research insights into non-functional languages perlocates down to accessible textbooks.",1435008462

You trade class types + interface types for record types + named structural types. You trade class inheritance for record extension. You gain a tiny little bit of flexibility via structural typing - but in my opinion much less than is often claimed, since in all these languages so-called structural types are only <i>partially</i> structural - and you lose some power at the tooling level (refactorings are no longer guaranteed to work). You gain a bit of flexibility by decoupling initialization into a function, but you also gain a bit of verbosity and lose a little bit of modularity.<p>Ultimately it&#x27;s a bit of a wash and honestly I would probably be almost as happy with OCaml or Rust or something like that as I am with Ceylon.

If one country has better infrastructures, geographical position to begin with, etc. It&#x27;s impossible for countries lagging behind to compete. The &#x27;developed&#x27; country will always produce XYZ products at a lower price because it has better technology. So the weaker country will accumulate an export deficit while the stronger country will accumulate a surplus. Now, the &#x27;strong country&#x27; will start employing more and more man-power, driving down unemployment because it becomes more and more competitive at product/service 1, product/service 2 and so on and so forth.<p>At the same time in the weak country will be harder and harder to produce (primary sector or secondary sector) and sell because products flowing in from &#x27;strong country&#x27; are in the same currency and being at the same union, there&#x27;s no import tax.<p>Now a 2nd year economics student, who has studied macro-economics, would tell you that at this point, the surplus sitting in &#x27;strong country&#x27; should become investment in various forms in &#x27;weak country&#x27; in order to allow &#x27;weak country&#x27; to somehow cope with the difference.

Greece is the weakest link, but if Greece goes out of the picture, you&#x27;ll see how Italy, Spain, Portugal and ultimately even France will look a lot like Greece in the long run because they can&#x27;t compete with the Germans having the same currency.<p>The above scheme underlies the biggest EUR caveat: You can&#x27;t have a common currency without having political integration. It&#x27;s simply impossible because in the long you will always have situations like this. While Greece is a small country so no one cares, when Italy&#x27;s of France&#x27;s turn comes, the repercussions and turmoil will be far greater and no matter what the media outlets say, the general feeling I&#x27;m getting from all over Europe is that the EUR didn&#x27;t integrate sh*t.

I strongly recommend that you ignore this feeling and learn a modicum of ML coding. If you want to learn TAPL, just learn a bit of Ocaml. You don&#x27;t need much. If you already speak C, a bit of Haskell and Ruby, you should be able to pick up enough Ocaml in a few hours/days. Programming in Ocaml is way easier than in Haskell or C. The only two things that are a <i>bit</i> difficult  in Ocaml are modules and the object system. You can <i>completely</i> ignore objects. Nobody ever uses them, and for TAPL you can also ignore modules (although you occasionally have to open a module, which is trival, something like: open Support.Pervasive).",1435007765

I think it&#x27;s this deceptive simplicity which causes people to write a dozen classes with 2-3 methods of 2-3 lines each to do something that should only take a dozen lines of code (this is not that extreme - I&#x27;ve seen and rewritten such things before.)<p>Perhaps we should be focusing on teaching the techniques for reducing complexity more than hiding it, and that abstraction is more of a necessary evil than something to be applied liberally. From the beginning, programmers should be exposed to simple solutions so they can develop a good estimate of how much code it <i>really</i> takes to solve a problem, as seeing massively overcomplex solutions tends to distort their perspective on this; at the least, if more of them would be asking things like &quot;why do I need to write all this code just to print &#x27;Hello world&#x27;, and the binary require over a million bytes of memory to run?

3. On one of your experiences, you mentioned about being second in command. Unless this is a military organization, hierarchy does not spell much of a difference.
4. Your CV does not provide insight nor complete focus on what value you could actually bring to the company which would potentially hire you.
5. Resume overall lacks appeal which would entice anyone to continue reading after the first few paragraphs.
6. You mentioned something about A Levels. What A Level? Of course I know you are mentioning about your education, but having completed a course does not completely translate to being able to deliver value.

You may be conflating this with the related doctrine on incitement.  (Basically, speech meant to incite violence is protected unless the violence is imminent.  &quot;You should kill the governor this weekend&quot; is basically 100% fine under US law.  &quot;You should kill the governor right now&quot; might not be.

Language is malleable.  My use of the word &quot;malleable&quot; could be a coded reference which means, to those in the know, that you should be hunted down and killed.  I mean, it doesn&#x27;t really sound like it is, but how can you determine that?  The answer is that you don&#x27;t need to.  Speech that you &quot;can&#x27;t determine&quot; isn&#x27;t a true threat is still protected.  It&#x27;s only when speech rises to the level of being clearly intended to cause fear in the recipient that it might lose its protection.  (Which is, incidentally, one of the larger reasons the speech was obviously protected:  It wasn&#x27;t made to the person allegedly being threatened.

Or a series of lucrative consulting gigs? :-)<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not as smart as I used to be, and I&#x27;m definitely not as smart or productive as some of the younger programmers I&#x27;ve worked with. (Sorry for the ageist remark!)<p>This may be my secret advantage: I <i>have</i> to keep my code simple enough that even I can understand it.<p>Here&#x27;s a fun example that I&#x27;ve seen more than a few times in various forms: four-way navigation, either involving up/down/left/right or north/south/east/west, or both.<p>In one (somewhat disguised) project it worked like this: the code had several different modules to provide a keyboard interface for geographic navigation, while keeping the geo code separated from the low level details of key codes and events and such.<p>There was a keyboard manager that mapped keycodes to readable names that were defined in an enum:<p><pre><code>  switch( keyCode ) {
      case 37:
          return KEY_LEFT;
      case 38:
          return KEY_UP;
      case 39:
          return KEY_RIGHT;
      case 40:
          return KEY_DOWN;
  }
</code></pre>
Then an event manager broadcast navigation messages based on the KEY_xxxx codes:<p><pre><code>  switch( keyEnum ) {
      case KEY_LEFT:
          BroadcastMessage( &#x27;keyLeft&#x27; );
      case KEY_RIGHT:
          BroadcastMessage( &#x27;keyRight&#x27; );
      case KEY_UP:
          BroadcastMessage( &#x27;keyUp&#x27; );
      case KEY_DOWN:
          BroadcastMessage( &#x27;keyDown&#x27; );
  }
</code></pre>
A navigation manager received these messages and called individual navigation functions:<p><pre><code>  // Don&#x27;t forget to reverse the directions here
  events.on( &#x27;keyLeft&#x27;, function() {
      moveRight();
  });
  events.on( &#x27;keyRight&#x27;, function() {
      moveLeft();
  });
  events.on( &#x27;keyUp&#x27;, function() {
      moveDown();
  });
  events.on( &#x27;keyDown&#x27;, function() {
      moveUp();
  });
</code></pre>
These navigation functions panned a map in one compass direction or another:<p><pre><code>  function moveUp() {
      map.pan( maps.DIRECTION_NORTH );
  }
  function moveDown() {
      map.pan( maps.DIRECTION_SOUTH );
  }
  function moveLeft() {
      map.pan( maps.DIRECTION_WEST );
  }
  function moveRight() {
      map.pan( maps.DIRECTION_EAST );
  }
</code></pre>
Of course most of you reading this can see the problem at a glance: Besides having so many layers of code, how many different names can we give to the same concept? We&#x27;ve got KEY_LEFT, keyLeft, moveLeft, and DIRECTION_WEST that all mean pretty much the same thing!<p>Imagine if math worked like this: You&#x27;d have to have two of every function, one for the positive numbers and another one for negative numbers. And probably four different functions if you are dealing with a complex number!<p>That of course suggests a solution: use numbers instead of names, +1 for up and -1 for down, ditto for right and left. And pass these numbers on through any of these layers of code so you only need half the functions. If you need to flip directions along the way (like the left arrow key navigating right), just multiply by -1 to reverse it instead of having to make special cases for each direction name.<p>You might even decide to combine the two axes, so instead of vertical and horizontal, you&#x27;ve got +1 and -1 there too (or 1 and 0, or <i>something</i> that lets you handle both axes with one piece of code). Now you could be down to a quarter of the original code.<p>Unfortunately, I was brought in on this project near the end to help wrap up a few other tricky problems, and all this navigation code was already set in stone. (And to be fair, working and tested, and who wants to go back and rewrite proven code, even if it is four times the code you need?)<p>But this would make a pretty good &quot;how would you clean this code up&quot; interview question!",1435007551

n 1966, Wang&#x27;s student Robert Berger solved the domino problem in the negative. He proved that no algorithm for the problem can exist, by showing how to translate any Turing machine into a set of Wang tiles that tiles the plane if and only if the Turing machine does not halt. The undecidability of the halting problem (the problem of testing whether a Turing machine eventually halts) then implies the undecidability of Wang&#x27;s tiling problem.",1435007263

Punishments: Intentional inclusion of security holes should be treated as a criminal act. FOSS maintainers who break the trust which is placed in them should be viewed as untrustworthy and anti-social. Have very clear red lines and very clear consequences. Pass laws which make it illegal for any actor , including the US government to petition a vendor to include security holes and backdoors.<p>3. Technical restraints: Have a two-person rule for commits. Open code reviews and cryptographically attestable append only revision systems with signed commits.

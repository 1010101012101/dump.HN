Instead, I would say that science is the combination of empiricism and reason.  While ultimately the process of science needs to agree with (and predict) data,  the harder part is usually using reasoning to build a model of what's going on.",1259128735

Without the web app their are no APIs, Tweetie may be a great app but it can't function without Twitter.<p>The power of web apps is in the interoperability and reach. The fact that I can access an app with a desktop interface, or through a browser, or on my phone, or on another browser is what makes web apps 'win'.<p>A Desktop app using 'web apis' is just an extension of a successful web app, but that's fine, it's all about building the right on-ramp for your users. Whatever gets them using the app is the right answer. But whether you're accessing it through a browser or native interface the web has won, there is no refuting that.",1259128612

Some are very difficult to put into words, but some are not. One example that is now considered trivial and well-known is ""shun global variables""... but then, just today I was fighting with code that's hard to work with because it uses global variables. This stuff is always news to somebody....<p>Another more recent example that may pass into that peculiar state of ""everybody agrees its common sense but by golly I sure see an awful lot of violations of it every week"" is being suspicious of mutable state. I'm not quite 100% sold on the ""never use mutable state"" idea (getting closer every month, though...), but I sure am 100% sold on being <i>suspicious</i> of it.

But this quake demo uses alchemy, which is LLVM based and offers significant performance gains.<p>The biggest bottleneck is rendering.  When displaying flash content, your cpu has to render every pixel of every frame.  The flash player vector capabilities are pretty extensive.  Supporting image rotations, resizes and alpha transparency can require multiple cpu passes.<p>The obvious answer to this problem is GPU rendering.  Adobe has made some efforts in this direction, but it doesn't look like it will happen any time soon.  There are many issues that make this transition difficult.

BUT most school districts have neither desire nor interest in looking for that sort of teacher ... and certainly not in paying them more. (So they get what they'll pay for.)<p>One reason for that situation: the majority of students won't respond to great teaching either... for a long list of reasons, one of which is that it doesn't start early enough (e.g. before sex). Another reason is that in most schools, education is not the first priority.<p>Who will develop this 'cool' curriculum? Teachers haven't got time. It's up to cool programmers to do that.

Why don't you share those mistakes and what you learnt (or link to them if you already have)? If you don't, you are not as good as the blogger you are criticizing... If your own standards are so high that you don't think you yourself are yet at a 'I should blog about this' level yet, I'm sure you're wrong.

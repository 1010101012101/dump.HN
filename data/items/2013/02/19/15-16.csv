But what sets apart industrial level compilers is all the accumulated knowledge built into them. Students are expected to understand the whole compiler they build for class. But how many people understand every single optimization that GCC can do?<p>My point is, there's understanding how compilers work, and then there's understanding all of GCC. I wouldn't like it if someone made the former sound too intimidating for me, but I don't mind feeling intimidated by the latter.",1361289586

I know a lot of people besides myself who would like an external airbag, if it is shown to be effective at reducing the severity of injuries and preventing death. If you really want to have a purely Randian viewpoint, consider this: empathy is something that people have evolved to have because it benefits them, and we're stuck with it even if not having it would be a benefit to themself in a particular situation, just like we're stuck with the tendency to become fat even though it may not be the best for you nowadays (not that I'm saying that empathy has become less evolutionarily useful over time -- just that humans do not make optimal selfish decisions all the time).",1361289536

My work experience was very varied, but I mostly focused on luxury(Porsche, BMW) cars towards the last years or so.<p>Being a mechanic gives you a different perspective on software. You don't see code ad <i>code</i>, but as an engine. If the engine is not tuned properly, the engine will not be as efficient as possible. If there is too much cruft in the code, the engine will perform poorly. Troubleshooting is also easier, I think. Due to the fact that all that mechanics due is troubleshoot. I once spent a <i>week</i> chasing an electrical <i>bug</i> on a Porsche. For those curious, it was the car's computer going bad (a circuit connection somehow broke under stress and it shorted). It also makes design a bit easier, because I have seen many different design patterns IRL. When you can touch and feel a design, working with them is much easier. For example, the camshaft is a function that makes valves open and close. The camshaft lobes are the parameters being passed as data to the camshaft function. The parameters tell the camshaft function how far should valves open, and for how much time.<p>It also removes any fear from working with any system. I've seen and fixed it all. There is no way any codebase will turn out to be harder to fix than changing the spark plugs on a 1996 Porsche 911 Turbo. No way.",1361289067

A degree was a signifier of at least basic competence and dependability.  At the very least, any college graduate you hired in 1980 was likely to be a decent employee.<p>But then we, as a society, decided that a college degree was an end in itself.  We looked around and saw that most middle class people had college degrees, so obviously if we wanted to grow the middle class, we just needed more college graduates.

One wearies of a film's efforts to tell a story (compared to a book and an active imagination), given certain limitations in the medium, but the filmmaking process is getting much worse as time passes -- there's the temptation to blow stuff up for two hours (the Michael Bay approach) instead of tell a story. Also flimmakers know high-quality films can't find an audience -- old-style films that respect the intelligence of the viewers end up in art houses and late-night TV.<p>To a first approximation, modern filmmaking is a bunch of business-school graduates getting together and trying to create a ""new"" film that's as much as possible like the last film that attracted a large audience. They do all they can to include elements that worked before, they're extremely risk-averse, and their cynicism about their audience is boundless (and largely justified).<p>Meanwhile, films like ""Juno"" and other first-rate films get a modest audience, but at high risk -- most courageous films like ""Juno"" fail, so the risks are high in producing a remarkable film that people also watch.<p>People need to realize that filmmaking is primarily a business, not an art form.

Most bad things in life are already illegal, but there seems to be the desire to add more laws to address that specific thing that bothers that specific group.

Politicians take advantage of this with the typical ""we must do something!"" or ""we must do this for the 'whatever'"" (typically children) rhetoric that addresses the emotion but tosses out all logic. It's similar to the perpetual war concept by always pointing over the border at ""the enemy"".<p>The problem is that your average person doesn't know enough of what's going on in the world and probably cannot do so anyway, that's the point of a representative government. That's another thing that politician's take advantage of, a person's willingness to believe whatever an ""expert"" states. Of course it's illegal to carry a firearm onto a plane, except for certain situations (police and so forth), but when someone of authority says that laws that prevent plastic guns from going on planes are expiring the average people assume the politician means that it will suddenly be legal to do so. That's not necessarily true, there are several other laws to prevent such a thing from happening. But the authority figure in his rhetoric chooses not to mention that.<p>As for almost all gun ban laws in place or have ever been proposed, if you take a hard look, do nothing in terms of preventing any other laws from being broken.

We don't just execute individual SSH commands, modules are remote resources that model idempotent state -- but don't stay resident.  The 0mq accelerator came later.  There's also a pull mode, and a local mode in Ansible.  Using SSH is nice because you don't have the additional PKI, and all that comes with having to maintain that.  (No needs of accurate NTP and DNS either, and working with Kerberized SSH and using your OS credentials is possible).   Need to do non-root things?  You can do things (if you have permissions) entirely as non-root.<p>Furthermore, Ansible does not have a dedicated daemon on the client.  It's daemonless, and consumes no resources when not running.  When running with 0mq, the daemon is ephemeral, stopping after a set period of time, to not consume resources.<p>It also requires no bootstrapping, so if you have blank cloud images with nothing on them, or brownfield systems in the field, you can just start managing them immediately.  cloud-init and so on are great for this, all cloud tools can inject keys. For this reason (no agents), it's starting to look very appealing on embedded devices and network hardware as well.<p>While implemented in Python you can write modules in any language.  Finally, Ansible's core focus is around making multi-tier orchestration easy (somewhat of a niche case), so that leads it to look a lot different at the  language/resource level.  But if you have just one tier, you can use it too.<p>It's frequently used to deal with rolling updates involving N-tier applications with monitoring servers and load balancers all in play, though you can definitely use Ansible just for classical config management.<p>I think part of the reason Salt may look similar to Ansible is Salt is clearly inspired by Func, especially the minion/overlord terminology, globbing, minion-to-minion, etc, and I was one of the original authors of Func at Red Hat.  We were toying around with a message bus Func at the time and decided not to do it.<p>So, yeah, lots of tools in this space.<p>In Ruby config land, there's also Sprinkle, Rexify, etc!  So many options!",1361287599

Bing.com may not include results from email, but this is irrelevant, Outlook.com certainly has full-text search so there's indexing.\n- Implement all kinds of cool stuff, e.g. Google Now right now shows that my last Amazon order has shipped, a single click on that shows the USPS tracking, how cool is that. Or more modestly, integration with other services from the same provider or from others such as cloud storage, office apps etc., or even simpler features like Outlook.com's ability to automatically sort email into categories, I doubt very much they can do it only looking at headers.

It found that those who took higher proportions of online courses were less likely to earn degrees or transfer to four-year colleges. The reasons for such failures are well known. Many students, for example, show up at college (or junior college) unprepared to learn, unable to manage time and having failed to master basics like math and English.""<p>Taking the statement ""Many students, for example, show up at college (or junior college) unprepared to learn"" (college-level subjects) at face value, which I will because I have seen multiple sources that report the same phenomenon, let's see if the editorial makes sense. The editorial does NOT say that anyone has done a treatment/control study of taking beginning college students of matched preparation and then having some take online courses by random assignment while others take brick-and-mortar courses by random assignment. It is that kind of study design<p><a href=""http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/experiment-design.html</a><p>that would be necessary to blame the online nature of the courses for lack of ""success"" (completing the course and going on to another course) by the students in the course.<p>If bad preparation of students before they attend college drags down the success rate in college courses (as seems plausible to me), then the policy response is to research better preparation for K-12 students.

I am guessing they are referring to the latter (where other studies -- take a quick gander at google -- do draw the conclusions that the article refers to as ""well known"")<p>Unfortunately I couldn't find the study that the article is explicitly referencing.",1361286343

I'm not knocking the students -- it is a characteristic of any population of people that the percentage who will do a very hard thing on their own is small.<p>It is more likely that mainstream college education will absorb online models, giving credit to the typically advanced students who do well in such courses but still running a large number of traditional classes or perhaps a set of classes that span a range of blended-ness (as most schools are moving toward now).

It seems like every other day I get dragged into a conversation with someone (usually someone I care deeply about) about being successful, or just <i>making things</i>. In the end the conversation typically ends when I say something like ""the only thing you've tried so far was coming up with excuses not to do something"". 95% of times, the conversation itself is inconsequential.<p>5% of times it results in something big. New jobs, more cash-flow, or just people being happier with themselves and what they do. I guess some people need a small push to start making things happen.

He ""did things"".<p>He had a vision, built the foundations himself, assembled a capable team, delegated appropriately, and oversaw the operations as needed. But he's not famous today. Why not? Because his social network didn't make it big. It was successful enough to give him a good middle-class lifestyle (better than ramen profitable) but it didn't make him millions. And today nobody knows of his brilliance or leadership skills.

Tons of it's source files have only the slightest smidgen of Scaladoc if any at all.<p>Also anything that actually is documented is probably deprecated or about to be usurped by another feature.

I'm quite sure the closest thing we'll get to objective truth varies widely between instances.<p>On the one hand, you are right, no success happens in a vacuum, and a lot of wealth is acquired directly through a good ol' boys network.<p>On the other hand, most successful entrepreneurs probably deserve credit for building a company no matter how many people help them.  Aside from being well-compensated in many cases, it's a tenuous argument that the employees of a successful startup would be creating the same amount of value without the inspired leadership and focus created by the entrepreneur.<p>I don't think the statement: <i>""all we've done is shift nobility from something granted by God to something granted by monetary wealth,""</i> is fair.

One of the most notable examples are the applications by 37signals: each of their apps takes care of just one aspect of the business and does it well.<p>What I am concerned about is the fact that small businesses (the target market of 37signals and other such companies) must subscribe to at least 3 or 4 different apps (perhaps from different vendors) to meet their otherwise uncomplicated requirements.<p>This may amount to a quite high monthly fee if all subscriptions are added together. Sure, the makers of such applications don't really see this ($20 a month per client is not much) but for the small business is a small fortune when added up (~$150). Despite this, it seems to me that this way of doing business (sell many different apps to the same company) is working well.<p>My guess at the moment is that it depends on the application and whether the target business can afford to <i>not</i> use it.",1293379423

Fame is a function of much more than just doing stuff. The media, for example, play an important and often highly selective role. Some have become famous by sleeping with the right producers, some have cured polio. Some have very obscure fame, Knuth, for example, is known pretty much to, and only to, every CS major. Youthful enthusiasm often neglects how critical luck is in life. Even if you achieve something highly beneficial to mankind doesn't guarantee fame, think of all the obscure inventors whose names we don't remember.

9398851,comment,9396409,9398552,0,0,EGreg,,,"That&#x27;s the thing. Most of the evolutionary theories about how something happened 2 or 200 million years ago are just on the level of speculation. That&#x27;s one of my gripes about evolution ... the field attracts a lot of pseudoscience (such as evolutionary psychology) in the form of &quot;explanations&quot; for various phenomena we observe today, or how a transition happened.<p>The truth is no one actually knows, or can test most of the theories that seem like they MIGHT be true but could also be fanciful speculations by researchers. That something was found is a fact. How it got there is largely speculation, but I&#x27;m surprised how often these theories are taken seriously, not just by the public but by other scientists.<p>Real tests include statistical significance, like exploring the fossil record across continents, simultaneously corroborating the theories of continental drift and common descent. Allopatric speciation can be discovered this way. You need a bunch of data points or functions of them, that should be independent but are highly correlated. That is what supports a theory, in the Fischer sense.<p>Here is an example: horse fossils are found physically above t-rex fossils 99.9% of the time, and in the remaining cases, the rocks show evidence of upheaval in that area. Or, radiometric dating vs the superposition principle. If 99% of the data samples agree, that is extremely significant. That is how you prove theories.",1429350664

9398847,story,,,59,59,rosege,"Ask HN: Could developers use the licensing model professional photographers use?",,"I was recently surprised to learn how professional photographers charge for their work. They charge for their time and expenses such as equipment rental, food, etc but the client never actually owns the IP. The photographer then charges a usage fee separate to their day rate and expenses. For example if its going to be in a magazine thats having 100,000 copies printed they would negotiate a fee for this and any additional use by the client would have to be paid for.<p>I see software companies as having a similar model where its pay per install etc.<p>What if independent developers were to adopt a similar charging model? Say I build a website for a company - charge for my time in building the site but then also issue them a monthly bill based on the number of people that have accessed the site. In reality I can&#x27;t see anyone agreeing to it - but somehow professional photographers are able to charge this way.<p>In this article: https://fstoppers.com/originals/guide-pricing-commercial-photography-part-4-license-fees-8713  \nThe author gives the example of the woman who designed Nike&#x27;s logo and only earning $35 because she didn&#x27;t have a license in place and at the time didn&#x27;t expect Nike to become the company it has. It seems kinda incredulous to me that this person feels entitled to more money simply because they did a job for someone and was paid for it (presumably a fair amount at the time) and then because their business has done great they should be entitled to be paid more when they haven&#x27;t really done anything extra to make the company the success it has become.",1429350551

So far I have been testing with high performance networks mostly (including good 3g however).

From the link:<p>> There can be a striking lack of accommodation or cooperation on the part of listeners [in rural Czech areas]. Once, when traveling with my brother, I watched him flounder in Czech at a small town gas station, trying to convey which pack of cigarettes he wanted to purchase—he had forgotten the brand name, and was trying to describe the appearance of the package. Ignoring his pointing gestures, the cashier sat stone-faced through his attempts. When she finally identified what he wanted, she tossed the cigarettes on the counter, saying contemptuously, “As you can see, the package is red, not pink.” My brother apologized, “I’m sorry, my Czech is very bad.” “I can see that,” she replied without cracking the slightest smile.<p>Experience with second-language learners is, speaking broadly, vanishingly rare among humans. Most people never meet any language learners. The rural Czechs are going by a rule of thumb: someone speaking that badly is more likely to be severely mentally retarded than anything else. (And they&#x27;re correct about that! If they started seeing a flood of foreign tourists with rudimentary Czech, they&#x27;d adjust accordingly.)",1429349163

9398808,comment,9396950,9397208,0,0,astrobe_,,,"Perhaps the authors deliberately ignored the embedded systems &quot;niche&quot;. Embedded systems have this &quot;unusual&quot; property that the one-time cost of software development is dwarfed by the 10^N-times cost of more expensive components. This is also true in theory in the desktop world, but it&#x27;s so easy to shame your customer for not using a high-end computer that it&#x27;s a non-issue.\nOptimizing compilers are needed for embedded systems because low-end micro-controllers don&#x27;t have the horsepower of desktops or even your latest smartphone, but yet the more features/the smarter behaviour the better. So you have better things to do than optimizing stuff for a processor you don&#x27;t know very well and that may be replaced in 5 years.",1429348733

As much as US companies may despise it but outside of their own borders they simply need to adhere to different rules though.<p>In the US a belligerent defiance coupled with some strong lobbying goes a long way but, like you&#x27;re seeing with Uber now, that approach doesn&#x27;t work as well across the pond. Likewise in this case is just about challenging Google&#x27;s use of its dominance to compete unfairly in other markets (which is illegal.)<p>That it happens to be about pushing domestic shopping sites down the rankings to favor their own results is rather incidental; at it&#x27;s core this is just a shot across the bow to make it clear that if Google wants ad-money from Europe they must play by Europe&#x27;s rules.<p>I hope Google gets that because these are not relationships you want to become adversarial or else someone might just decide to close the little tax loophole that lets Google escape taxation of its EU revenue.",1429348696

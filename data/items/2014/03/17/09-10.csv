He was never considered to be a key player in the company.&quot;<p>He was right. He should&#x27;ve been recognized as a key player. But the idea that being seen as a key player in the company requires you to be higher in the hierarchy is a fallacy.<p>The art of good company structure is keeping the hierarchy relatively flat (not non-existent, but still relatively flat), so hierarchy does not become the de-facto tool for &quot;recognition&quot; of an employee. There was no reason this programmer shouldn&#x27;t have gotten more respect (during decision making) and more money even than his direct boss, but staying in the position he&#x27;s in, where he&#x27;s contributing his best.<p>Apple&#x27;s infamous &quot;top 100&quot; meetings pick 100 of the most influential people in the company for a secret retreat. They&#x27;re not selected by hierarchy. They&#x27;re selected by their individual contributions. There&#x27;s a lot of wisdom in that way of doing things.<p>And a side note about mental conditions. It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;oh he was probably unstable anyway&quot;, but that&#x27;s bullshit. Every one of you &quot;stable&quot; people have a breaking point. Every one of you. Environmental stress is a huge factor affecting our mental health. So if this happens at your company, don&#x27;t look for external excuses. Look around yourself, identify the causes, fix them.",1395050299

I shipped like crazy on my job in the initial few days. X numbers of procedures written, Y number of proposals evaluated, Z number of reports generated where X, Y, and Z were much higher than average. It was mostly to see how much I could get done, and I was getting a lot done. Initially my boss was happy but then more work kept piling up on my desk because I could obviously get this work done while some of my co-workers continued to work at snail&#x27;s pace. I don&#x27;t fault them because they obviously knew that it was better just to do the minimum amount of work to not raise questions and then chill in the break room or just catching up on each other&#x27;s lives.<p>Anyway long story short I learned that unless it is a make or break situation where the upside is written in a contract, it is just better to coast along when working at MegaCorps (I can&#x27;t comment on startups as I haven&#x27;t worked at one).<p>On another note, one of the things we do is we train and certify people. This is a high volume service and most companies want certificates for each individual that they contract with us for a training. One of my co-workers used to manually copy fields such as ; FirstName, LastName, NameOfTraining, DateofAttendence, Validity, NameOfCompany, NameOfTrainer, CertificateNo, etc. from an Excel file for each individual on to a word document and then hit print. She would do this 100 times if there were 100 attendees who were trained. It was her full time job because it was so time consuming. All I had to do was setup MailMerge on MS Word that took data from Excel and generated all the certificates in one batch to reduce her full time job to 10 minutes. Obviously I need to switch companies soon lest I go crazy too.",1395050242

Looking at the share price on its own is fairly uninteresting, as that does not take into account the total value to shareholders. If you want to look at total value to shareholders, take the share price and assume that every dollar paid in dividends is immediately re-invested in more shares in the company.

Replacing a transponder with something that is much simpler than an epirb. The example I gave is a $100 dollar current piece of tech that weigs 150 grams including power-source, and if it was available to LOS througha window could track the plane for 4-7 hours off a single set of batteries. If you want to raise the budget for an order of magnitude or two, for 10k dollars you could surely create a redundant system for the transponder.<p>The larger point is that any &quot;real situation&quot; that would need the transponder turned off (power/fire/corruption) would have almost no bearing on the operability of such a simple system.<p>FYI the imarsat pings are not all that different, are they? Its just a simple ping with some data that including headers is going to be very minimal payload...like SMS text type level of data.",1395047793

First of all how could the potential hijackers know that the Malaysian military wasn&#x27;t properly monitoring the radar? There would have been a huge risk of the Malaysian military discovering it and scrambling jets.<p>The collision avoidance system only works when the transponder is enabled. So flying in the radar shadow of another aircraft would take some extreme skill. And wouldn&#x27;t they have to adjust their position according to the position of the several radar antennas? What about potential mobile radar systems, e.g., on military ships? It would have also all depended on perfectly finding SIA68. What if it had a two hour delay? Not unlikely on international flights.<p>Where would they secretly land the aircraft? It takes a more than 1km straight and wide runway. And it has to be remote enough from any town or military installation. But they would have to bring large amount of supplies like jet fuel. (Which they would secretly get where?) They would have to deal with 240 people on board. Someone who would steal such an aircraft is certainly ruthless but ruthless enough to murder 240 people? They would have to hide the aircraft from satellite surveillance. It would take a ground crew to refuel and maintain the aircraft.<p>All in all there are so many things which could go wrong.

7413940,comment,7404970,7410087,1,0,userbinator,,,"> I&#x27;d love to hear some proposals for simplifying the implementation.<p>The one thing that stands out is that many of the classes only have one instance created, and they&#x27;re classes that don&#x27;t have much functionality in them. Returning structures from functions requires a copy, in this case the array of button states, and copies of them are also created inside of functions like ButtonDebouncer::update. Only one of these state arrays is ever needed, so make only one...<p>The actual matrix-scan loop in HardwareController could also be simplified greatly; this usually just involves shifting a 1 bit through the row/column driver output port register(s) and reading the input port(s). There&#x27;s no need to turn all the rows/columns off each time, since getting the next col/row is only a matter of changing which one is being driven. Getting the button number shouldn&#x27;t require a multiplication (I&#x27;ll admit I was pretty shocked when I saw that!) either, since each iteration of the inner loop is the button after the previous one, so it can be done with one counter.<p>> Mostly USB library stuff, I think. Been a while since I profiled it.<p>I&#x27;m more familiar with PS/2 keyboard protocol which is much simpler, but USB shouldn&#x27;t be that much more complex to send/receive info once everything has been initialised (and as I understand from working with USB controllers in non-keyboard devices, the SIE does much of the actual transfer work in hardware.)<p>> Can you further explain this paragraph? I don&#x27;t know what you mean by &quot;unused positions in the key matrix&quot;.<p>There can be row/column combinations which don&#x27;t have keyswitches at their intersection, but are scanned anyway. You can connect other units so that they act like keyswitches when they send information.<p>> Like I said: I&#x27;d have no implement the protocol from scratch, in software. The hardware UART does not support this functionality.<p>Of course.<p>> Which were?<p>A non-continuous clock. Transfers that occur in small bursts instead of one continuous serial stream.<p>(I have studied the IBM keyboard firmware, and worked with one for an 8051-based controller before.)",1395047676

Most Github repos I stumble upon are through other media and social networks mentioning cool stuff, just like HN.

Lack of organization does not imply freedom, and strict organization does not imply lack thereof. While anarchism appeals to me as well sometimes, I do not for one second believe that it brings more individual freedom. Are people in <i>The Walking Dead</i> more free than us? Diffuse power structures breed just as much oppression as tyrannical ones. An individual can as easily be abused by a group with no clear leaders as by a tyrant. And this isn&#x27;t theoretical: historical and sociological examples support this (e.g. bullying in schools). Clear organizations nurture freedom just as often as they suppress it. The adoption of strict(er) government regulation in the US to suppress the unchecked power of the free-market robber barons in the early 1900s clearly increased individual freedom in the US for the majority of people (while curtailing the industrialists&#x27; &quot;freedom&quot; to exploit the populace).",1395047288

A semaphore is also not used for sending processes to sleep.<p>Linus explanation makes sense, speaking only about a single OS, which may is comprised of multiple processors. But makes no sense at all for real multi-processor designs. I don&#x27;t blame him for his narrow view, more his professors that he never experienced real embedded design.<p>I have worked in the past with multi-processors designs, where one processor was using one OS, like OS9, and the other processor had no OS at all running. Both processors where exchanging data via a dual ported RAM. So basically both processes where competing for the same resource. But even than, using a semaphore does not prevent race-conditions. Even then it is very tricky to use them. Because dual ported RAM allowed real concurrent access to the same resource.<p>In summary, the semaphore definition is the more broad definition where 2 (or more) processes are competing for a single resource. The naming convention within Linux is more specific for this requirements. The &quot;invented&quot; spinlock is just a renamed version for a fast semaphore, AFAIK. Even a mutex is just a special case of a semaphore.",1418831594

We&#x27;re doing more and making less!<p>Yahoo isn&#x27;t a products company -- it&#x27;s a pile of cash with long audience reach. This isn&#x27;t a bad thing (and indeed was the situation at Apple when Jobs returned), but it does mean that the company has lots of options but no core mission. The danger is that such a company can kill its cows while searching for stars.<p>It&#x27;s hard to avoid the conclusion that Mayer has failed to develop any kind of coherent strategy, let alone execution. Instead, she appears to have substituted chaotic action as a metric of progress (new home pages every day! Purple everywhere!), mistaken her hobbies as evidence of expertise (e.g., deciding Yahoo could become a destination for high-end <i>prêt-à-porter</i> fashion consumers), and taken on high-concept strategies without any kind of plan for generating revenue and income (e.g., going deep on content). This doesn&#x27;t even get to Yahoo&#x27;s constant overpaying for startups that are inevitably killed by indigestion -- I like to say that VCs operate on the greater fool theory, and right now the greatest fool is Yahoo.<p>Couple this with what is evidently a tendency to micromanage without attention to detail, a constant reworking of HR aspects without any comprehension of how such changes affected loyal employees, and an almost imperial demeanor -- no surprise that her tenure is already being prepped for postmortems. Mayer&#x27;s failures have at best led to drift and at worst burned the little remaining daylight left for Yahoo.

8762648,comment,8760392,8760392,0,0,gdilla,,,"Funny, just got an email from my 4y/o&#x27;s montessori school explaining why they start with cursive!<p>&quot;It is commonly asked why children learn cursive writing instead of print in Montessori classrooms. From a practical point of view, it is thought that very young children&#x27;s scribbles and early drawings are flowing and circular, more like cursive writing; making it more natural to learn first. At the Casa level, children love to repeat things making it a good time to practice penmanship. Given the distinct shape of each cursive letter, there is less confusion and less tendency to reverse letters such as b, d, p, and q. In printing there can be a tendency to mix upper and lower case letters together (e.g. CaNada,) which does not usually happen with cursive letters. Cursive also seems to be a more efficient way of writing since the letters are joined together.<p>Another reason stems from the fact that in Montessori schools children write before they read. In traditional schools, children in the first years of school are learning to read and write simultaneously and can be confused if they are learning to write in cursive and read in print. In Montessori, when the child is three and four years old, he is learning how to &#x27;write&#x27;. He learns the sounds the letters make, learns to recognize them and learns how to form them. Once he knows the sounds, he can put sounds together to write words with the Movable Alphabet (cut out cursive letters that can be moved about freely and combined to make words) and eventually, with pencil and paper. For children who come to school knowing the alphabet names associated to print letters, it helps that the cursive letters look different when they learn the sounds of the letters. As a further step, children learn to read. When this happens they read print letters. Once children know the cursive letters, they are usually able to easily recognize the printed letters. So, they have the advantage over children who have learned to recognize print first and do not necessarily recognize cursive letters.&quot;",1418831155

device and app history - whats apps are running, browsing history, bookmarks
identity - accounts on the device, profile data
photo/media/files - access to files on the device and the device&#x27;s external storage
wi-fi connection information - whether wi-fi is enabled, names of connected wi-fi devices
device ID and call information - determine the phone number and device IDs, whether a call is active, and the remote number connected by a call<p>I can understand why it might need access to the file system to, for example, upload an avatar.  The access to wi-fi seems innocuous, although I would expect something like network connectivity and status to be delegated to a kernel module or background daemon with which an app interfaces.<p>But is there any legitimate (i.e. some non-financial oriented mine as much data as possible) reason it needs to be able to see what other apps are running, my browser history or who is on the other end of a call?  There might not be any reason, and ESPN could potentially build the app to have as many or as few permissions as they deem valuable, because people want an app to manage fantasy football teams first.  While this example might not be the best, since ESPN is a huge brand and there is no alternative if they are hosting your league, the situation was the same with so many other apps; just absurd permission requirements.<p>None were installed.",1418831005

All N nodes create L-bit DC-net ciphertexts and send them up the tree. Each interior node obtains the <=B cipher texts from its children, XORs them together with its own L-bit ciphertext, and passes the result up the tree.  The root gets the XOR of all N of the L-bit cipher texts, the (anonymous) sender&#x27;s plaintext pops out, and the root broadcasts that plaintext down the tree exactly as for standard tree-based multicast.  During the DC-nets phase each node receives <=B*L bits from its children and sends L bits to its parent, exactly equal to the bandwidth total cost of the (subsequent) downward multicast phase.<p>So in principle the fundamental cost of adding DC-nets anonymity to a tree-based multicast protocol, via this approach, is thus basically 2x over non-anonymous multicast.  This applies equally to bandwidth, latency, and processing costs.<p>This is &quot;in principle&quot; of course, because there are many caveats: it&#x27;s not so obvious how to make this theoretically scalable tree-based approach deal with churn or disruption, or do all the other things Dissent and other more practical systems have to deal with.  Actually bringing this theoretically achievable level of scalability into practical reality is one of our goals but still very much &quot;work-in-progress&quot;.",1418830912

I love being asked if an application can use my location, as opposed to having god knows how many apps on my N10 silently sampling my position.

Since 2013  American children have been required to learn how to use a keyboard and write in print.<p>I&#x27;m sorry. This is so ludicrous. If you can&#x27;t write legibly unless you&#x27;re using a computer, how can you be called literate?<p>And don&#x27;t come back and say, &quot;it&#x27;s perfectly fine for them to use print.&quot; I attended public school myself, learned to write cursive in the 3rd grade, and never used it again. I thought my natural printing style was good enough, to the point where, to this day, I still sign my name in the jagged, chopped-up, pseudo-cursive printing style that I invented in 4th grade, and only I can read.<p>Now, I&#x27;m a person who loves to listen to classes and take notes with a pen. About 6 months ago, I looked at the piles of jumbled-up notebooks in my closet and was horrified at the chicken scratch on it. I could barely make sense of it. I might as well have not even been taking notes. So I decided to try cursive again. Now, I refuse to print anything unless I have to. Cursive is so much easier, so much faster, so much more legible, so much neater. I simply can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t use it for 20 years of my life. People always tell me how good my handwriting is now.<p>Maybe some people came out of grade school with a neater printing style than I did, but I really, really doubt they can keep that neatness while writing as quickly as they WOULD be if they were using cursive. I would really like to know what the standards people were thinking when they made this decision.",1418829988

See the &quot;Dissent in Numbers&quot; paper for the details on how this works: <a href=""http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/osdi12-abs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/osdi12-abs</a><p>There are caveats of course.  This version of Dissent depends on a (small) number of servers, which are only collectively (not individually) trusted - only one of those servers needs to be honest and not colluding with the others for the security guarantees to hold, which is good for security.  On the downside this means that the protocol is not robust to <i>server churn</i> - i.e., if one server fails, everything does grind to a halt.  Other liveness/security balances are possible: e.g., we could require only a threshold number of servers to be live, at the cost of vulnerability to smaller colluding sets of malicious servers.<p>Another caveat is that in <i>any</i> anonymity system in which client churn is present AND users maintain long-lived pseudonyms of any kind, client churn can be used by a smart attacker to de-anonymize clients via intersection attacks.  This basically means that if you want &quot;the strongest possible&quot; anonymity protection, you basically either have to (a) never maintain pseudonyms or use time-linkable communication sessions at all (difficult!), or (b) eliminate client churn completely (also difficult!).  Our Buddies paper explores this tradeoff and the (admittedly limited, so far) practical defenses that we can build against intersection attacks: <a href=""http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/buddies-abs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dedis.cs.yale.edu/dissent/papers/buddies-abs</a><p>Cheers

Somebody would need to pay taxes on it, and then there&#x27;s the laws in whatever countries you&#x27;re working to consider.<p>Second, there&#x27;s the immediate lack of benefits to funding someone outside your company. If you want a particular feature or fix done, you can&#x27;t demand this person do it as they don&#x27;t work for you. And if they quit, you&#x27;ll have to hire someone to maintain it anyway, right? And if you need some domain-specific expertise or customization down the road, you&#x27;ll again need to hire an expert for your company. It just makes a whole lot more sense to hire and keep an expert in-house that maintains the code, rather than gift to some rando some large chunk of money to work on something without addressing your company-specific needs.<p>Third, if you wanted funding, you&#x27;d probably have to show you have a board made up of the companies that fund you and some industry peers, have a roadmap, processes for discovering, addressing and solving issues, etc... basically your own little organization to manage everything. Just one guy doing code isn&#x27;t necessarily enough for sponsors to take you seriously.<p>The problem here is that there&#x27;s just one developer.

To me, that&#x27;s a recipe for disaster: it means there&#x27;s a &#x27;smell&#x27; with this project, and maybe someone should fork it and do what they want with it now.<p>(I actually work and have worked in companies where this has happened... nobody is going to get funding approved to give money to someone outside their company for something that would be better served in-house)",1418828777

That&#x27;s maybe the most important thing to realize in life, that every aspect of your life is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that&#x27;s been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don&#x27;t have to. If there&#x27;s something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle and you can fight for a cause.</i><p><i>I&#x27;m not saying you have to live your life this way. I&#x27;m not saying you should. I&#x27;m saying it&#x27;s an option.</i><p>You said: <i>I almost feel embarassed that it took me to the point where I had everything in my own life put together before I could really take the time to think seriously about what I could do to help those around me.</i> Those words will haunt me for a long time.<p>Congrats on finding and taking the option.

Not handwriting.<p>I disagree that cursive vs block letters is not important. In the past schools have taught both. But as typing replaces writing for long texts, cursive has become obsolete.

Musk&#x27;s entire vision for SpaceX[0] involves cheap, reusable spaceflight, simply because there’s no other way to colonize a different planet without it. According to Musk, abandoning “disposable” rocket technology would result in a 100 fold reduction of the cost of rocket launches[1]. While it might not be that significant, I fully believe than NASA could utilize the minute budget it has much better without throwing away millions of dollars of technology every launch.<p>Based on that, landing this rocket perfectly is the proof Musk needs to show the world he can launch that rocket again in 10 hours, essentially turning rocket launches into a daily—not monthly—occurrence.<p>Musk’s vision aside, it would be so cool to land a fucking rocking on floating object in the middle of the ocean. It’s basically a reverse missile maneuver. They’re not ramming the object, they’re just gently touching down, but with all the more accuracy.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.space.com/25636-spacex-reusable-rocket-test-elon-musk.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/25636-spacex-reusable-rocket-test-elon-...</a>

They're doing this because their original purpose is being done better by new technology. It is simply no longer rational to have a big building to house information printed on slices of dead tree. Libraries and librarians do lots of important and useful things other than simply lend books, but they're having to figure out how to reinvent themselves now that the core service is obsolete.<p>The vast majority of contact hours in the vast majority of educational institutions consist of chalk-and-talk - someone writing things on a board and talking. The available evidence shows that there is no clear benefit to doing this in the flesh over delivering the same approach through video, and that there might be significant benefits to providing it in a modular format that can be paused and rewound. Sal might not be the greatest math teacher on earth, but soon enough, somewhere on the internet will be lessons by 99th percentile teachers on every imaginable topic.<p>If your best argument is ""We can do what the internet does, only marginally better"", then you're in deep trouble - we've seen how well that has played out for any number of people. The economies of scale are too great, the rate of iteration too rapid. You're just not going to beat the internet at supplying data.

I suspect that broadcasters in the rest of the world know that 20 minutes of commercials per hour is unacceptable, so they don't bid as much as our networks. EDIT: The only source I could find indicates that the BBC paid about $100 million for broadcast rights to these games.  That's 1/10th of what NBC paid, or about 1/2 of the American fees on a per capita basis.",1343433919

It requires having a package with both CNBC and MSNBC to get access. I still actually have a cable TV package, but my provider does not offer MSNBC on any of their packages so I'm out of luck.<p>Thankfully, there's the Yankees/Red Sox this weekend so I'll watch that instead.<p>[^1]: Thankfully ESPN bought the rights to Wimbledon starting this year.

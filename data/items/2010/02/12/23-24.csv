I prefer languages like Python/Ruby that have one arbitrary-precision integer type and one floating point type, or languages like Haskell or Lisp that have a rich selection of floating/fixed/abitrary/rational types with well-defined performance.  But some (not all) of the WTFs here exist in all of those languages too.  Eventually, programmers working with numbers really do need to learn how to use different numerical representations.",1266019157

RDFa is the W3C’s solution for embedding meta-data into HTML, whereas Microdata is Ian Hixon’s baby. The W3C working group recently voted to split Microdata out of the HTML5 spec, something that Hixon, as editor, was not pleased about. He did it for the W3C spec, but not for the WHAT-WG, thus meaning the two specs are no longer in sync.<p>Whoever is right, Ian Hixon’s opinion should be only be considered in light of his personal stake in this issue, and his often demonstrated disdain for the W3C and its processes in general. Portraying the W3C as a secretive, compromised organisation helps to drive people toward the WHAT-WG. Of course, the WHAT-WG, being a smaller, invitation-only group of browser vendors, is in many ways more opaque than the W3C, it just lacks some of the bureaucracy around it.</i>",1266018128

It's <i>not</i> an easy language to learn, and the item you've pointed to is really rather good - I only spotted a few small errors that matter, and I'm very picky.  It's certainly much, <i>much</i> better than I ever got at French, German, Danish, Swedish, Bulgarian or Spanish.  Overall, they didn't really detract from the item.<p>For many people it won't matter much, but for a few it definitely will.  You need to decide how much it matters to you, and if you decide it matters, you need a copy-editor.  You don't want someone to write the copy, you just want someone to tidy it up and remove the worst of the errors without changing the content much.<p>What contacts do you have?  My circle of contacts would, for me, each copy-edit a few hundred words a fortnight.  Depending how much I wrote, that would probably be enough without imposing on them too much.  I'd also then buy them a beer, or cook them a meal every couple of weeks to say thank you.<p>There are also tools such as the Link Grammar.  After spell checking, type what you want into that and see if you get one parse.  If so, you're done.  It's easy to download and install, and not so hard to automate.<p>That would be my recommendation.<p>PS: I'm a complete grammar-nazi and am probably much more severe than most people.

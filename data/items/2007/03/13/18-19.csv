3959,comment,3921,3921,0,0,mynameishere,,,"Ugh. Macintoshes. I know pg came out in their favor a while ago (""All the hackers I know are switching to Macs""...something like that). But, man, to see it in reality. My mother has an older OSX machine. What a piece of work. Even the parts of it that are supposed to be good, like the interface, are just clumsy. The mouse is ungainly, with one big ""button"", making a laughable full-palm-press-down the most reliable way to click. The scrollbars and window-edges are mysteriously hard to grab. The icons in the taskbar would have seemed childish to me when I was 10. The power of Unix is pretty well hidden. If I'm on my linux machine, you can bet I'm not using KDE. Without the shell, linux might as well be Windows. <p>Now, if it was OSX vs. Windows 98, sure. But XP (*) is stable and the candy colors are easily removed. The security problems only concern the ignorant.  I'm not too impressed by people who will pay a 400-800 dollar premium for the geek equivilent of a status symbol.<p>(*) I've never used Vista.",1173811689
3958,comment,3868,3868,0,0,paul,,,"Accepting credit cards: a Tactic, not a Business Model<p>Obviously ""free"" is not a complete business model, but how blind do you have to be to keep repeating these silly anti-free arguments despite the overwhelming success of many businesses based of free things? (Google, television, etc)<p>If you can build a product that will get a lot of users and has low per-user costs, then free is an excellent option and almost inevitable (because you will face competition from free). On the other hand, if your product has limited appeal or high costs, then you probably need to charge. ",1173811686

3954,comment,3878,3941,0,0,far33d,,,"I'm not saying it is that simple. Google is in the right here.  They obey the law, they give customers exactly what they want. <p>The issue is on the supply side: How can content producers adapt to this altered economy? Right now, their answer has been to sue and hold tightly to the old business models. My argument is more nuanced than just protecting copyright -- I believe there is a way to make money producing quality content, but maybe not for the big, hollywood sized producers. I'm more interested in how to empower the people in-between viacom and the lone camcorder. <p>\n",1173811180
3953,comment,3542,3920,0,0,Harj,,,"To clarify I wasn't referring to London here.  I was referring to real startup dead spots like Missouri or Alaska or other places that literally have no startups there.  In those cases you have no option but to move.<p>In places where there's a fledging startup scene, the decision is tougher but ultimately we still decided to move as that was the best decision based on our circumstances.",1173810936
3952,comment,3670,3787,0,0,paul,,,"Exactly. Even with micropayments, I would still have to think about it, and I don't like having to think. This is part of the reason why the most popular micropayment system on the web is Google AdSense.<p>On the other hand, I regularly send text messages on my phone without much though given to the crazy $0.15 per-message fee.",1173810920
3951,comment,3934,3934,0,0,far33d,,,"The best C hacker I've ever met (probably the best programmer, period) swears by Haskell and functional programming. So does the second best. <p>In my time here at my full-time job I've mentored a lot of kids straight out of school. So often I hear things like ""I can't wait to start programming in a real language with pointers"" after they've been doing support scripting in python or tcl or whatever. Unfortunately, people like to feel like they are controlling the computer.. because they want to show how well they know how it works. They love the HOW of programming, because it makes them feel smart. <p>But Great Programmers want to solve problems quickly. They want to do what first, how later. \n ",1173810746
3950,comment,3878,3930,0,0,Readmore,,,"I completely agree. Google knew that they needed to be involved in this lawsuit or the future of their business, and perhaps the Internet, could be in jeopardy. If YouTube had to settle or try to fight the lawsuit on their own it is very likely that the outcome wouldn't have been favorable for Google. By buying them and taking the lawsuit on themselves Google is able to use their warchest to fight for the future of the Internet. I'm very excited to see how this plays out.",1173810709

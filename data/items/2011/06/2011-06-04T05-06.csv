The idea is to have a license that requires only the program source in question to be released when it is modified, and for it to be released under the same license. In this way, the program and all its modifications must remain usable by both open-source and proprietary programs. The LGPL permits converting code to GPL, which deliberately prevents modifications from being used by proprietary programs. Even when this is removed, it still specifically prohibits any sort of static linking or usage of any of its code inside a proprietary application. One has to use a dynamic DLL link, which flat out doesn't work for any template-based or inline'd C++ functions and is a very confusing legal mess.",1307166293

And if stores prefer Google Offers to Groupon, then Groupon collapses. From the point of view of the merchants, this is all about getting repeat customers who will make up for the loss that they are taking on the coupons (or, in some cases, betting on customers spending enough in addition to the coupon to make a profit on the one sale).<p>The moat that Groupon needs isn't scale, it's loyal merchants who will offer coupons on Groupon repeatedly - which will get users to use it.

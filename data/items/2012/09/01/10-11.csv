Check any map of Palestinian territories, 1930 to present, to see which entity has more power. Or check a tally of casualties on both sides.<p>That said, it's not ""racist hate propaganda"" that left wing idealists accept. That's how Israel describes it (understandably). What they do accept is that other people can be right to protest against Israel, and that that does not automatically means ""antisemitism"" in the historical sense.<p>Believe it or not, the incredible harm (genocide) done by the Nazi's to jews, does not automatically translate to modern day Israel being on the right against it's neighbours, or generally in any possible conflict.",1346496963

Another is testing and prototyping (on the same stack as you do production).<p>I think most shops with a high hardware need would probably have a mix -- things that scale well to the hardware (eg: database servers) might be set up as clusters of physical machines.<p>Less (performance) critical stuff like mail servers, bug tracking and time sheet appliances, backup domain controllers etc -- might be run as vms.<p>I agree that if you find yourself running a single vm on a physical box, you should probably reconsider how you are doing things...<p>Then again, all things considered -- if your (presumably) easy-to-mange vm based setup gives you enough performance -- why not keep it.<p>If nothing else as you upgrade hardware, if your workload doesn't increase exponentially, you will be able to consolidate on fewer servers. Consider a database service that in 2003 was set up master-slave on two physical pizza boxes. That could probably be run from two vms (on physically different boxes, for redundancy) -- with capacity to spare on either box today.",1346496536

I think a higher-IQ argument is always better than a low-IQ argument with the same EQ. A high-EQ argument without a high IQ can be actively harmful.<p>Empty rhetoric is good for manipulating idiots. It's useful if you have a good point, and want to make it sound more interesting. But it's not essential, and it's actively harmful if you don't have a good reason for using it. Low-EQ / high-IQ arguments won't convince a lot of people, but they aren't actively harmful (unless you count a few ruffled feathers as serious harm).<p>Also, high-IQ arguments convince the <i>right</i> people - people who listen to reasoning, and are unlikely to change their mind when people use hollow emotional arguments.

4463303,comment,4462882,4463116,1,0,josephlord,,,"Thanks, that is a much more informative comment than your original.<p>UK law is different to US law (apart from anything in the US a priority date at the time of invention rather than filing could be claimed) so it is quite possible one patent is valid and the other isn't.<p>I've looked at 'Data Detectors' very briefly and I think that you may be right.  Looking just at the claims it appears to cover just about any data processing system which would obviously have massive prior art.  I assume Apple are trying to say it should be interpreted more narrowly to avoid prior art but throwing it out would probably be the best result.<p>I haven't looked at the other two and you may be right although only the claims really matter rather than the example implementation details.<p>Apart from the troubling 'Data Detectors' patent I agree that there should be easy workarounds.  The best justification for pressing these cases I can see is that they are trying to create and ensure some differences  with Android even though they are fairly minor.  It is quite arguable that this is a completely proper use of patents although whether it is worth the effort I don't know.",1346495002

(A universal phenomenon in those countries -- and yes, using external enemies is not unique to dictators.) Just see how Iran motivates anything with attacks against Israel. <i>The left wingers must KNOW what they are supporting!</i><p>2. Isn't it racism to accept so low standards for [mainly ethnic] groups and assume them to be unable to be responsible for their actions?!<p>3. This tolerance (of e.g. antisemitism) goes for Muslims living in Western Europe too, which hardly have these excuses. So it isn't coherent.<p>4. Why do the left accept the arguments and world view (re Israel), when they at the same time argues it comes from a bunch of illiterates that aren't responsible for their actions/opinions?<p>5. Should people with low education get lower punishments for crimes? Should they get no punishment if they can't read and don't understand the law?<p>6.

You can even do this in nighttime and have them land and wait undetected on some rooftop until you want them to continue their mission.<p>A handfull of such multicopters will make more terror than 9/11 ever could do because 9/11 was (almost) concentrated to a single place. 9/11 had passenger lists so it was easy to find out who took control of the planes. Multicopter bombers have no passenger lists, no sender address. You don't know how many more planes are in the air and when they will strike.<p>Redundancy and multi-target missions are even cheaper and more efficient with multicopters than in the 9/11 attacks.  Multicopters are so cheap that the terrorists can launch a bunch of them and not care if half of them fail to get to their target.  Multicopters bombers works for targeting e.g. Disney Parks and other places with a lot of easily frightened people out in the open.<p>With 9/11 it was easy to get away from the attacks (i.e. just leave that part of Manhatten).

A five-paragraph I-hate-Perl rant by someone who obviously neither knows the language nor wants to.<p>Though I probably wouldn't recommend Perl as a first language for everybody either, that's some pretty weak arguments.  Appeal to authority of other Perl haters only proves Perl haters exist.<p>For crying out loud, Perl doesn't have exposed pointers.  Perl doesn't prevent the programmer from doing basic parameter checking in functions.  Decent REPLs are available for Perl.  How could ""the Perl REPL"" not work with readline if he just said there wasn't a Perl REPL in the previous sentence?  Perl doesn't have the same opinion as him as to what sane typing is.  Doing stupid stuff results in undefined (to him, at least) behavior.  It's possible to implement action-at-a-distance in Perl.<p>Python and Ruby have their warts too, they're just not exposed in this thread because there's no hater around to quote out-of-context lists of surprising behavior.<p>Arguing not to learn Perl because the average Perl out there is ugly?  Non sequitur.  No one with an open mind blah blah blah?  I've got opposing data points. (not to mention the true scotsman)<p>Particularly ironic to quote that MJD text from almost twelve years ago.

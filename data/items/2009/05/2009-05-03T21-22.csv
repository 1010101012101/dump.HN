The article seemed to me to clearly be advocating something more akin to the combination of the breeder reactor at Marcoule and the reprocessing facilities at La Hague in France(which releases less than 1% of the natural background radiation).",1241387972

We like to believe that all our differences do not make a difference, but fortunately and unfortunately they do.<p>For example if YC funds more startups with women you will not see the impact in the next 2 years. But 10 years from now those  veterans would have encouraged several younger women to get into technical fields. Everyone will benefit from that.<p>I have had the chance to meet and work with a couple of female programmers, and although I am not a coder I was most certainly thrilled.",1241387959

Rippleweb moved quickly to help me recover; the rest of the down time was due to a faulty cross-connect.

If you want more info email me (my address is in my profile).<p>I wasn't saying 'statistics' as a magical name, I was just using it as shorthand for the explanation that it provides. Frankly, I don't have the time or inclination to type up a half hour lecture on stats (especially since there are thousands of others who have already done so far better than I could).<p>But, here's the 10 second explanation:
Many easily measurable outputs (height, weight, wealth, etc) are functions of a large number of roughly randomly distributed inputs. It's very unlikely that all these inputs are lined up in such a way that the observable output is maximized or minimized. It's much more likely that they will, in fact, on average cancel each other out. Given a sufficient number of trials (i.e., a large enough population), this results in a normal/guassian/bell-curve distribution of the observable output.<p>Given other distributions/correlations of inputs you get the other common distributions of outputs (lognormal, boltzmann, exponential, etc).",1241387786

Visa allows/expects/hopes you'll carry a balance on your card. Amex disallows it.<p>* In business-to-business situations, everyone accepts Amex.<p>* Amex has absolutely killer customer service. There is simply no comparison. Amex dispute resolution is ""default deny"" to merchants; when I've contested charges, I've never spent more than 5 minutes on the phone. Total. I feel safer charging big-ticket items on my Amex than on any other card.<p>The major difference between Amex and Visa is the business model; Visa is a payment system that works through card-issuing banks. Your relationship isn't with the card; it's to some bank. Amex is a company, and your relationship is to Amex.",1241387637

There are a lot of ways to misrepresent data, and data on graphs, but this isn't one of them.  These graphs are especially nice because the Y-axis labels are in a largish font, so it's more difficult to misinterpret the scale.<p>I do have a minor problem with the last graph though, ""Monthly supply of homes for sale"".  Since this is meant to compare existing homes to new homes, the line graph and the thickness of the line doesn't convey enough of the target information; this would be better done as a bar graph, with two bars, one for existing and one for new, for each year.<p>I had a boss once who made graphs with three Y-axes on them (two on the left and one on the right) and multiple X-axes, all in different scales, mixed linear and exponential. He tried to use different colors, but would then print it out in greyscale.  They were extremely hard to read and get anything useful out of, which I always thought was part of his goal.",1241387065

Someone who is just the tiniest bit smarter than me may see a shortcut that they I don't that saves them a tremendous quantity of resources.<p>Study after study has shown that 'overpaid' people (sports stars, actors, etc) get paid a wage that is almost exactly equal to the marginal revenue they bring in - that is they are paid perfectly appropriately.",1241385824

Maybe, just maybe, it is true that they have everything lined up and ready to go and just need the funding, but so claim pretty much any other crazy space startup. Some of these actually have pretty sizable working rocket engines and have flown experimental vehicles already, yet they make humbler claims. I'd just take the news with a grain of salt.

The fact that entrants were largely between 18 and 24 years old seems more to do with a lack of professional experience (evidenced by partaking in spec work), than some magic ability of younger people to be able to do compelling work in technology.<p>I think it's more probable that those grizzled old guys with beards are too busy getting paid for their labor to partake in a lottery, hence the skewed demographics.

The underlying assumption here is that the body has a built-in expiration date that we cannot avoid, but I didn't think it effectively answered the question of when that expiration date actually is.<p>My problem with the article, I guess, is the lack of a perspective over time.  De Gray also posited that the first person to live to 1000 is probably already alive, I'm not saying all of this really makes sense, but it is scientifically feasible and should at least be noted in an article that asserts the opposite.<p>According to Wolfram Alpha, the probability of living past 100 (in the United States) increased from .17% to 1.4% between 1933 and 2000 and then to 2.4% in 2008. Living past 70 jumped from 45% to 75% to 76% in the same time period.

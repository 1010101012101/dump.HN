It's not a coincidence that KP is announcing this at the <i>same</i> press conference where Apple announces a bunch of business-friendly iPhone features.<p>The seventies-era Steve Jobs would have just put up a bloody banner that said DELENDA EST RIM, but I'm sure the older and wiser Jobs decided that an influential VC in a suit, wielding a suitcase stuffed with hundred-dollar bills, would make a better impression on the typical IT manager.<p>Did they name a single company that would actually get any of this money? I haven't seen any mention of one. And AFAIK the existence of a big pile of yet-uninvested VC money is not news.",1204862299

131037,comment,130947,130947,0,0,dfranke,,,"Just curious, why do you want one?  It seems to me that a code editor is almost uniquely unsuited to be a web app.  You need to keep your data locally anyhow, unless your whole toolchain is a web service.  Furthermore, my editor is a tool I want absolute control over: I don't want its behavior changing unexpectedly when a new update is released.",1204861525

Don’t let it be downloaded until it can be bought.""<p>His argument is actually a bit more subtle than that, and since you're in a similar position I'd recommend listening to his actual C[4] presentation instead of just this isolated quote.<p>But it boils down to: Yes, you can get the PR out of sync with the product. Yes, it can cost you sales. Yes, it can even tank your company.

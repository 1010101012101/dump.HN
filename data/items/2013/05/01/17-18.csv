5639625,comment,5639458,5639458,1,0,laughfactory,,,"I've found excellent jobs via the ""Career"" section of a company's website, via recruiters off LinkedIn, and via a combination of job post online combined with finding the recruiters information at the company and contacting them directly to apply.<p>My approach was very successful. Less than two months after graduating with my BS in Economics I landed a excellent paid internship ($40,000/yr) in Credit Risk Analysis at a large regional bank. Three months later I was promoted to Credit Risk Analyst and given a raise to $51,000/yr + all the nice bank benefits.<p>So yes, it can be done. My approach included a healthy dose of determination, precision targeting of applications to recruiters and hiring managers, personalization of my application package to the job post, and being a well-prepared candidate who presents well. Apply for jobs you're actually interested, address what they're looking for in your cover-letter and resume, as much as possible get your application materials to hiring managers or recruiters directly, always dress and behave with class (wear a tailored suit to your interviews, shower, shave, and put your best foot forward), and never give up.<p>The problem is that most people adopt some of the worst job-hunting techniques imaginable. They write one resume and one cover-letter and then just send the combination out to every job they can think of. They bombard ""Career"" websites with derivative forgettable applications that may not have any apparent relation to the position advertised. Then should they get an interview, they may or may not show up, and may or may not put the time into presenting themselves in the best possible light. In short: many job seekers these days are super lazy (to put it very bluntly). They act entitled to a good job with a minimum of effort.<p>When I was interviewing I couldn't believe the other candidates I saw out there. They'd show up in ill-fitting ratty jeans, a wrinkled tie, with a three-week overgrowth of facial hair and grumpy demeanor. Just seeing them in the waiting area I thought there's no way I'd ever hire any of those people no matter what they had on their resume.<p>And sometimes interviewees wouldn't even show for their scheduled interview. When I worked at the bank, one candidate for a very high-paying position didn't bother to call and didn't bother to show the first time she scheduled an interview. Then she had the gall to call later, offer no reason for her no-show/no-call previously and reschedule another interview...which she also didn't show up for. Unbelievable.<p>In other words, if you are truly a ""professional"" and convey it in every way in your job hunt, you will find a ""good job"" one way or another--traditional hiring system or not. I hope this helps!",1367431085

PLIST is a list of files the package will install.

Come to think of it, online backup services have existed for a long time, I remember using a similar service at a previous job 6+ years ago. I recall that it was quite expensive and certainly not unlimited. I seems clear that Backblaze was able to get to $10 million revenue by competing on price - dirt cheap pricing. And the dirt cheap pricing was made possible by not paying salaries, running a ""data center"" in an employee's apartment, building servers from ultra low cost hardware components, violating residential zoning laws, oversubscribing storage capacity, etc. One can only wonder what kind of sacrifices were made in terms of physical and network security. I wonder how many of their first customers realized that their backups were sitting in someone's apartment ... somehow I doubt it was disclosed at the time?<p>The problem with this kind of business model is that it is effectively a small business owner mindset. $10 million revenue after 6 years of toiling away ... at $5 per month, this means that they have something like 2 million users ...   considering all the other backup solutions available (including far more secure solutions), it seems quite possible that their growth will stall or slow down as their target market is going to be relatively small and already saturated and you can't go much lower than $5 a month to continue competing on price alone. Incidentally, I noticed that their website actually says ""as low as $3.96 per month"" ... so they are continuing to push the limit on price. I'm not sure that a price war / race to zero is the optimal strategy for this business ... this is like trying market the world's cheapest helmet or life vest - how many people would seriously want that?",1367431026

I submit that it is only the amount of it you write.<p>I spent several years of my life focusing on reporting, and spending more time writing/maintaining SQL than writing any other language.  In that time I discovered that complex SQL queries are a language like anything else.  For ""hello world"" you can get away with anything.  But as soon as you are doing complex stuff, the layout matters.<p>Did you know that it can make a difference whether a condition is in your ON or your WHERE?  It can.  (Think left joins.)  Did you know that the location/order of the ON statements can make a difference?  It does.  Is it visually obvious where this particular condition is?  It should be.  Did you know that the order you put things in in your query can have performance impacts?  It shouldn't, but it does (particularly for MySQL - MySQL is stupid).<p>If you've got 200ish character lines and you are unwilling to format, well, I'm glad that I don't work with you.

The term exceeds authorized access means to access a computer with authorization and to use such access to obtain or alter information in the computer that the accesser is not entitled so to obtain or alter.<p>Later in the same section, it states:<p>> Prosecutors rarely argue that a defendant accessed a computer without authorization when the defendant had some authority to access that computer. However, several civil cases have held that defendants lost their authorization to access computers when they breached a duty of loyalty to the authorizing parties, even if the authorizing parties were unaware of the breach. [...] Some of these cases further suggest that such a breach can occur when the user decides to access the computer for a purpose that is contrary to the interests of the authorizing party. See, e.g., Citrin, 440 F.3d at 420 (defendants authorization to access computer terminated when he resolved to destroy employers files); ViChip Corp. v. Lee, 438 F. Supp. 2d 1087, 1100 (N.D. Cal. 2006) (same); NCMIC Finance Corp. v. Artino, 638 F. Supp. 2d 1042, 1057 (S.D. Iowa 2009) ([T]he determinative question is whether Artino breached his duty of loyalty to NCMIC when Artino obtained information from NCMICs computers.).<p>Not sure what to make of that, as again, IANAL. Still, this is definitely not hacking in the traditional legal sense.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/cioprod/documents/ComputerFraud-AbuseAct.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/cioprod/documents/Compute...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ccmanual.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.justice.gov/criminal/cybercrime/docs/ccmanual.pdf</a>",1367430586

The casinos <i>KNEW</i> they were being ripped off by a counterfeiter, because their token counts at the end of the day were coming in consistently high, but they were stymied because they could not tell which tokens were counterfeit. That made it hard to even get started tracking their origin. Even the token manufacturers were not able to determine which of a set of tokens were authentic and which were counterfeit. [1]<p>Colavecchio's downfall came one day when he was playing a machine, and it jammed, eating his token. He simply moved to the next machine, and continued playing. That caught the attention of the guard watching that row of machines on the security camera. These machines were something like $10 or $25 per play machines. When a legitimate gambler has a token of that value eaten by a machine, they don't just let it go and move on to another machine. They report it and make a fuss until they get their money back. The guard realized that one person who would just move on would be the counterfeiter--he would not want to draw attention to himself by making a fuss, and psychologically would think of his tokens as only worth a few cents and so would not be upset at losing one.<p>With that lead, they were able to watch Colavecchio and get enough evidence to nail him.<p>[1] Years after Colavecchio was caught and convicted, his counterfeit tokens remained in circulation in Atlantic City casinos, because they never did figure out a way to tell which were real and which were Colavecchio's.",1367430338

We're looking for developers on HTML5, WebGL, iOS, and Android to build the next generation of rich media as well as touch-based content creation tools from the ground up.<p>We believe that ads should actually be fun; as fast, interactive and personalized as the best games and apps. That's why we built the world's first 3D platform for display advertising. Our startup, AdJitsu, was acquired by Amobee almost a year ago. Our team continues to operate like an autonomous startup, with the added benefit of our parent company's resources.<p>Our PULSE 3D platform combines WebGL (or native OpenGL on iOS) with HTML5 to create a designer-friendly environment for building interactive experiences powered by programmable shaders. You can have a look at some of our ads here: <a href=""http://amobee.com/3d"" rel=""nofollow"">http://amobee.com/3d</a>.<p>As a startup within a startup (we're a team of six people including three engineers with a lot of autonomy), you'll have the chance to own and solve problems such as:<p>* Build the next generation of realtime rendering and user interaction on mobile\n* Rethink content creation tools, from the ground up, for multi-touch interfaces \n* Design immersive, sensor-driven user experiences for clients\n* Analyze billions of data points from user interaction<p>We touch everything from SIMD assembly and fragment shaders, to Hadoop and Pig, and almost everything in between. Objective C, C++, HTML 5, Javascript, WebGL, Python, git and more are tools we use every day.<p>Our client include brands like BMW, Samsung, Autodesk, and Nokia. Our team brings experience from Apple, Cooliris, Dreamworks, Microsoft, Namco Bandai, NVIDIA, Ubisoft, and more.

For cutting edge products and extremely large volumes, yes you need experience. For a very complicated product, I again agree. But for the majority of what we're seeing with ""Kickstarted, low to mid-volume production""? Disagree. If you have a mechanical or manufacturing background you can absolutely get a new product launched without paying Dragon or PCH exorbitant amounts of money. Will there be hiccups? Yes, but nothing catastrophic if you follow good engineering principles.<p>Design, validation and simulation can all be carried out in advanced CAD packages (or by not-advanced CAD + lots of labor).<p>Depending on your timeline, you can prototype locally for higher costs but faster iteration (design, build, test), or you can prototype with suppliers more slowly but save on production verification and testing. The speed benefits are variable too: I've had US proto houses come back with ridiculous lead times and Chinese factories turn around a production verification sub-assembly in less than a week. YMMV.<p>I love the smile curve; I've never seen it before, but that is exactly how things work. But the situation is changing as more and more Chinese factories of all sizes integrate engineering teams and work to become OEM/ODMs for the local market. The other changes are in the labor rate: as China gets more expensive that curve is going to flatten.<p>For small scale stuff in the 100's to 10's of thousands I think that you can go it alone for the right product class, which happens to be most of what we see here on HN/Kickstarter. Find factories on Alibaba, spend a minimal amount of money testing them out, place small orders to protect yourself and voila!

Your description sounds like the many I've heard from other (male) programmers over the years. The point is that you didn't need any other incentive to try it out, and whatever distasteful stereotypes that may exist didn't deter you. Therefore, you fit in with the typical profile of someone who got into programming (perhaps a better way to put it).<p>>Not me. I'm not in the HN bubble<p>I'd say you're in it more than most, judging by your submission history.

(Well, I do, but that's an entirely separate argument, and a distraction from this one). The question here is just what drugs can legally <i>be sold or prescribed</i>, regardless of how people learn about them. Currently, ""off-label"" use is COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE to the FDA! Once a drug is legal to use, you can use it for any condition at all, not just the condition it was proved efficacious for.<p>So we already <i>have</i> current widespread use of drugs that haven't been proven efficacious. It doesn't seem to have been a disaster. In fact, widespread use of drugs is one of the few forms of medical intervention that demonstrably makes people <i>more healthy</i> on net. Right now the rule is that it's legal to use drugs if:<p>(a) they got accidentally grandfathered in due to historical use (eg, aspirin and penicillin would NOT have passed the FDA's current standards), or\n(b) they were patentable and turned out to be useful enough for treating SOMETHING that it was worth spending on the order of a billion dollars getting SOME use approved, even if it's not the use it's being prescribed for now.<p>Meanwhile, a drug that is just as effective but isn't patentable or treats a rare enough condition that it's not worth spending a billion dollars to get it through trials in the US...is not legal to prescribe.<p>Can you honestly justify that contrast?<p>If a drug has been legal in, say, Denmark, for five or ten years, has seen widespread use, and hasn't caused mass deaths THERE, why can't we just automatically make it legal to use here WITHOUT spending hundreds of millions of dollars redoing the same studies here? Do we think the FDA is somehow smarter and better at its job than its equivalent in every other country in the world?<p>The FDA faces the wrong incentives. It has no reason to take into account the huge cost of the harm it does, which is a matter of life or death to people with rare or serious diseases. It needs to be fundamentally overhauled or gotten rid of entirely. Yes, there would be costs to letting more people take more drugs...but every serious attempt to estimate it says the benefits would outweigh the costs. If you don't want sick people dying needlessly, you should be opposed to the FDA in its current form. It is an idea whose time has gone.",1367429390

As a consumer, I am not going to subscribe to a dozen different streaming video services, one per distributor who thinks they're too good to be aggregated. I don't care how good you think you are or how good you're going to be, and frankly I don't even care if you were each trying to charge me a dollar a month, because <i>it's just plain too much hassle</i> to be subscribed to one service per distributor.<p>Even free, it would be a bad deal. It's not hard to imagine a world where Warner Brothers works on my phone and my XBox, but not my PS3, Fox works on my PS3 and my Linux computer, but not my XBox, Discovery doesn't work anywhere because they don't have the technical chops to properly set up their network, and <i>on</i> and on it goes. There's a lot of distributors, even accounting for which of you have merged and operate under a dozen names. None of them as good as Netflix, working in as many places as Netflix, and as reliable as Netflix. (Oh, you think it's <i>easy</i> to serve video at this scale... yeah... heh heh heh. Your little websites with bits and snippets of video was barely getting your feet wet in that world.)<p>And of course it won't be free. Perhaps $9.99 a month for ""everything"" is unsustainable at any level (even though Netflix is generally not exactly the freshest content in general), but I'm just not going to chase you all down to give you money individually, and I know at least some of you are going to get really big heads and think you can charge $19.99 or something for a vanishing fraction of Netflix's content.<p>This is bullshit, and nobody's going to put up with it. I don't necessarily want there to be just One Uber Aggregator either, so you're going to have to deal with Amazon and Netflix and iTunes, but you can't go it alone. I'm not going to follow you.

5639309,comment,5637973,5639181,3,0,firefoxman1,,,"Well said. Those are the two opposing sides of labor in capitalism. As Marx pointed out, a company does best by commoditizing labor. To make a worker as replaceable as possible is in the best interest of the company: They can pay less and hold his replace-ability over his head. ""I demand a higher pay or I'll quit"" is met with ""Fine, your position will be filled tomorrow morning"" and realizing his replace-ability the employee feels it's better to at least have a job, thus creating the illusion of employee loyalty.<p>Now with companies like Google you see what happens when the pendulum swings toward the workers' favor. Google employees are top-notch. They are <i>much</i> harder to replace, so the company offers amazing things on top of great pay to keep them. Again, it appears to be loyalty but it's always in their own interest. Keeping and taking care of these amazing employees is how they create great things.<p>It seems that the best option as an employee is to find an industry/position that requires a unique, hard-to-replace set of skills and dominate that position.",1367428938

At the highest rungs of the big corporate ladder, you are essentially a politician. And little more. You are tasked with ""legislation"" the way a Congressman is tasked with such. But you're spending 99% of your time pandering to the base, setting up and maintaining alliances, cheerleading, politicking, and kissing babies.<p>These skills are derided by those who hate corporate politics, as most of us probably do. But to get to the top, and to manage effectively from the top, you need to play the game and be damned good at it. If not, you'll be out in 6 months -- and even if not, you'll be a lame duck, unable to get a coalition to advance your agenda. This is why, at each rung up the ladder, political skill, social capital, and favor become increasingly important criteria for advancement.<p>You're expected to get great results, of course -- but the number of people that stand in the way of your input --> your output increases exponentially the higher you climb.

The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research.<p>Many people believe that science is too closed, and too slow. We are trying to change that. There are 4 things we are trying to achieve with Academia.edu - ways in which we are trying to re-shape and accelerate science:<p>- Instant distribution. Right now there is a 12 month time-lag between submitting a paper to a journal, and the paper being published. We need to remove that time-lag and introduce instant distribution of scientific ideas.<p>- Better peer review. Right now the peer review process takes 12 months to complete, and only surfaces the opinions of two academics - academics who may be biased, uninformed about the subject area, or just in a bad mood when writing the review. 2 people is too small a sample size. We need a faster and more robust peer review system, one that surfaces the opinions of the entire scientific community, across a variety of dimensions, and in real-time.<p>- Multi-media. Right now, scientists only share papers in PDF form. We need to bring about a science where scientists are incentivized to share data-sets, code, videos, blog posts, and comments on all these media. Right now 50% or more of the worlds scientific output does not get shared, because the system of credibility metrics only rewards one kind of format, the paper. We need to change this.<p>- Open access. We need to bring about a world where a villager in India has the same access to the worlds scientific output as a professor in Harvard. When you open up access to the worlds scientific literature to the 2.5 billion people who are online right now, magical things can happen.<p>It's an exciting time for science. Science is transitioning from a 17th century way of sharing ideas, based on the journal system, to a faster system of sharing ideas on the web. Science is a foundational part of global growth: almost every innovation in medicine and technology has its roots in a science paper.<p>We need talented and passionate engineers to help us accelerate science. We have made a good start: 2.9 million academics have joined Academia.edu, and 13,000 join each day.\nWe're a 12 person, engineering-driven, team based in downtown San Francisco. Technologies we use include Rails, PostgreSQL, Redis, Varnish, Solr, Memcached, and Mongodb. We have raised $6.7 million from Spark Capital, True Ventures, Mark Shuttleworth (founder of Ubuntu), and others.<p>Familiarity with our technologies is a plus, but it's not essential. It's far more important that you are a quick learner who can pick up new technologies quickly.

5639234,comment,5620842,5638400,1,0,hackinthebochs,,,"Sorry, I didn't see this post earlier. The paper you link to makes some good arguments about the approval process. While I absolutely can't agree that the legal system can effectively screen out dangerous drugs without an oversight agency like the FDA, I can agree that the approval process for drugs to treat acute deadly diseases should be expedited in proportion to the severity of the condition it treats. The problem I see with these arguments is that they're using the worst case scenarios to argue abolishing the agency altogether. Aside from cases of life-saving drugs, the FDA also works to keep drugs and devices to treat non life-threatening or cosmetic cases from being harmful or deadly. An argument that beta-blocker drugs should have been approved faster is not an argument that  your typical diet drug should have been. If we can draw a distinction between these cases, I'm more receptive to the arguments you're making.<p>As far as aspirin for heart attacks goes, I can see the logic in not allowing a drug company to advertise its use for this purpose. Were doctors made aware of this use and were they trained to offer it as medication in appropriate cases? If so, then I think the system worked as it should. If not then there should be a system in place that disseminates such information to doctors and other medical professionals. But allowing drug companies to advertise directly is a massive can of worms. I don't think it should be allowed at all, let alone for ""unproven"" uses. People are not knowledgeable or responsible enough to evaluate the use of a drug based on uncertain information.",1367428361

There's a definite feel of <i>design</i>, as opposed to a large set of features and interfaces that happen to work together to varying degrees as in Linux.<p>And the man pages.  Oh, how wondrous they were.  This first thing I had to do was learn to NOT google for how to accomplish something, but just read the man page.  Often, there's not much on google about something because there was no need for someone to document how they accomplished it, they just did what the man page said <i>and it worked</i>.<p>In linux, the man pages are generally skeletons outlining some flags and what something might support.  In BSD (or at least OpenBSD) for core OS items, they are <i>canonical</i>.\nCompare:<p><pre><code>  http://linux.die.net/man/8/ifconfig\n\n  http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=ifconfig\n</code></pre>\nNote: One the reasons the OpenBSD ifconfig man page is so big is because on OpenBSD ifconfig does the job of multiple Linux utils, <i>because it makes sense to have ifconfig control all the interface state</i>.<p>That said, I still mainly use Linux, specifically RHEL and derivatives, specifically because I think the enterprise Linux distros have a better support model for enterprise environments, where multiple machines need to be kept up to date or in sync, and you need to deploy identically (and repeatably) to systems.<p>Frankly, I'm surprised there's not a alternate, distro model for FreeBSD that's aimed at the enterprise to address these issues (or if there is, it's not popular enough for me to know of it).  Maybe FreeBSD as an organization is coherent <i>enough</i> and does a <i>good enough</i> job at support for the distro in general that there's never been enough of push to really compete in the enterprise server market.  Or maybe I'm just misinformed about how much BSD is in use in the enterprise.  That's always a possibility.",1367428159

Let me make a few comments re: some of the more interesting points I've read.<p>1) I love Redis, but in my book, if you're already using MongoDB, its more of a tool for reducing latencies once you're looking to scale. If I'm just looking to prototype I'll probably use one or the other, but not both. I love the MEANR / MEANER acronym though, but I can't support the EJS decision, I'm all about Jade =)<p>2) AngularJS not good for hackathons? Sounds like a subject for another post. Granted it may be that I'm just extremely biased towards Angular, I was an intern with the Google team that developed it in '08 and I've been using it since v0.9.9. However, I find Angular's slick two-way data-binding to be completely indispensable for building a prototype. There are two primary reasons for this, first I find the paradigm of writing Javascript which explicitly references the DOM to be brittle, and second it makes life easier for my designer because he never has to worry about breaking the frontend Javascript.<p>3) I agree that Javascript is a rapidly developing language and many of the tools that I use may well be obsolete within a few years. However, I think that I benefit from using the tools that I believe are best in the meantime, and when better tools are released, then we'll change along with them.<p>Thanks again for the commentary, I really appreciate it. I'll be coming out with a few more posts in the near future, please be on the lookout =)",1367427974

When I'm reading and trying to digset such scripts, the long format described by the author, particularly putting each column on its own row, makes it difficult to easily digest the script. I'm forced to scroll constantly to make sense of the statements in relation to one another. Instead, I prefer to my SQL to be more compact, so I can view as much of the total script as possible.<p>To accomplish this, and to maintain readability, I structure each statement something like this:<p>CREATE/INSERT/UPDATE line\nSELECT line\nFROM line\nJOINS (if present)\nON (if present)\nWHERE (if present)\nAND (if present)\nAdditional SQL (qualify, group by, order by)\n;<p>If I have a lot of columns, the select portion will get split into several lines, usually where there is a case when, column operations, or when the line is 200ish characters long.<p>This makes the most sense to me, as each command (create, update, insert, select, from, join, on, where, and, group by) is on its own line, followed by the information relevevant to it.",1367427653

5639171,story,,,3,0,luksi,"What happend to ""the scene""",,"This might not be the appropriate place for this question. However I dont know any other place with more people of different age groups and so various backgrounds, so I will simply ask.<p>Back some years I was involved in what was called The Scene. I was part of a music release group. It was a crazy time when we traded gamez and MP3z through FTPs and looked up to RNS. Other great groups from that time where SUT, MAD, WHOA.  I can remember how happy I was when I got my first topsite account. I could reach new top speeds when trading and had almost immediate access to razor1911 releases, so I could beat the guys on my homesite. We communicated through mIRC back them, where we had a channel and a newsbot. My homesite was a 100MBIT,  1TB  (which at that time was really big!) with an Swedish guy as admin.<p>That was back in 2003 when I spend hours with getting new stuff, rippin it, releasing. Through travel, sports, studies and girlfriends my priorities changed and I quit and got lost. Now 10 years later Im a grown man looking back at those years. I still see releases beeing shared through torrents and I know there is still something in the background. But I would like whether the scene is still existing, whether it is the same. If youre were part of us back them youll know what I mean.<p>I really appreciate any answers since i'm looking back at those times.<p>Thank you",1367427642

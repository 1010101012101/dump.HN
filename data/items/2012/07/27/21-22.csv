4303777,comment,4302782,4303533,4,0,kstenerud,,,"Right now you are using 32bpp images, and then falling back to 16bpp for slower devices. Because PNG uses zip-style compression, pictures of houses won't compress that well, so your size on disk and size in memory will be similar.<p>PVRTC allows you to save at 4bpp or 2bpp, so you'll get sizes 8x or even 16x SMALLER than a full color image, both on disk and while loaded into memory (loading images are a major source of lag on iPhone, so a smaller on-disk footprint is always welcome). You can even zip compress it for further on-disk savings, though YMMV.<p>The quality degradation is similar to what you'll get in JPEG, in that there will be some artifacting depending on the quality of the encoder and the source image (hard edges don't compress well, nor does text, but photorealistic images retain a lot of quality).<p>The power-of-2 restriction is the only real pain point of PVRTC. But if you're making sprite sheets, that's probably not going to be a big issue for you anyway. Once it's in memory it's just a texture like any other, and you can use it sprite sheet style like you're already doing, chopping up the contents any way you choose.<p>I suggest you try cropping one of your house images to a square sized power-of-2 as a quick test and convert it to PVRTC so you can see for yourself what the quality is like. It may yet be usable for your purposes, and the potential payoff is huge.",1343426136

Their value didn't go up much in 10 years, so the ""potential"" earnings of that money was not realised - so despite the shares not going backwards, I lost out.<p>Facebook is a losing proposition, unless they pull a rabbit out of the hat - and there's nothing on the horizon at all that even indicates they will come up with something.",1343425784

I was of your opinion and recently changed that when learnt about Instagram success.<p>It seems like internet is still a very young thing and people jump the ship or move on to a new thing very often, without much sentiment, like a child on a playground going from one toy to another.<p>Twitter introduced photos sharing long time ago, but it didn't stop guys from Insta to literally rip it off (adding ""follows"" and similar features). Where one thought ""well I cannot build photo sharing service because the giant in the room (twitter) just introduced it"" -- the others just continued pushing the code and eventually exit for $1B.<p>I think at some point users will move on from Facebook like they did from MySpace. MySpace biggest problem was javascript, audio and graphical clutter that rape you fresh out of the screen once the page finished loading. So others (hello Facebook) took advantage of it and come up with similar page but this time nice fresh and cleancut. So let's move further and ask ourselves a question: what is the biggest Facebook problem? I believe right now it is overclutter with irrelevant info served from your network. Having more than 100 ""friends"" makes your wall so clutter than no information is of value anymore.<p>So you want to come up with Facebook killer? no problem -- just build a system (whether mechanical or manual) where users can take real advantage out of their network, not miss important update from important friends and miss the unnecessary garbage they are not interested in. Don't be fooled by ""oh they wont come because they did all this work building up their facebook profiles"". Not only there is FB Api that you can connect to and download all FB user data in minutes, but if FB would close that gate, you can still program a info scrapper that would do so.<p>Bottom line: Facebook won't be here forever, and next stage of social is million connected friends but only relevant info rendered.",1343425779

The ideal ownership stake within the portfolio company, comfort level with higher valuations, investment allocated across multiple rounds for a portfolio company all are a function of fund-size and investment strategy.<p>As the active fund size increases (e.g. $500MM or $1B), the fund is biased towards making big investments and hugs wins are needed for LP returns. When fundraising for your startup, its critical to understand if these dynamics are going to be a cause of conflict between your investors and you.

Apple, Dell, HP and other large companies sign contracts for sizable deliveries of these components.  In some cases the panels are made exclusively for a specific manufacturer (and corresponding product).  And, in these cases, it is very common to have a contractual restriction on the availability of the panel in question for general use.  In other words, I could not buy a single panel for a year (or more).  Once the panels are release for sale to non-contract parties (generally industrial users or other OEMs) the manufacturer will make it available to distribution, book orders and schedule manufacturing accordingly.  Lead times run anywhere from 12 to 20+ weeks depending on the panel and other factors.  Some B-grade (and below) panels are immediately available (manufacturers love to unload these rather than take the loss).  A-grade panels go through the standard manufacturing process and, well, you get yours when they are ready.  They don't cut into Apple's supply to sell some to Joe-Blow-Monitor manufacturer.<p>It sounds like people are somewhat confused and concluding that because the panel had the same part number as the one used by Apple they ""came directly from Apple's supply"".  The only way that can happen is if Apple discontinues the product in question and there's an overstock of panels that the manufacturer needs to unload or; Apple rejects a pile of panels and, again, the manufacturer is very happy to unload them on the unsuspecting masses.  Other than that, the fact that the panels have the same part number does not mean that  they ""came directly from Apple's supply"".",1343423784

Do you really trust people that waste their time paying hand over fist, listening to the next person sing when there are real problems in the world worth solving?<p>Actors aren't rare. Singers aren't rare. I can do tradesmen work with less training that's needed to start someone from square one like this article suggests. If companies are in real need of tradesmen, why not just convert engineers over?<p>> The pay structure is aligned with value delivered and the rarity of the skills in question.\nYour opinion that education is what should get compensated is deeply uninteresting.<p>I never said people should be compensated based solely on education. Nice strawman. But the fact that you find the value of education ""deeply uninteresting"" just tells me that you're lazy and really shouldn't even be making claims about tradesmen who require at least some form of education. Its just there education is extremely compartmentalized. Their job isn't meant for design, innovation, and flexibility.<p>> Baseless assertion.<p>A plumber making $90k/yr may not have the exact same IQ you have, but he's likely smart enough to buy a house, save for retirement, etc...and a lot less likely to gamble his entire future on one ""hot"" startup.<p>I've known a lot more tradesmen with second and third houses (for the rental income) than I've know engineers.<p>Notice I said probably, as in I'm not really sure, but since you trust a few million people that spend tons of money on sports than myself, it makes your position debatable. So it leads to the question, does a plumber need to make $90k/yr to buy a house, save for retirement, etc? And by the way, just because you know more tradesmen with retirement homes than engineers, doesn't make it true unless you perform a study with appropriate sample size and statistical rigor to suggest a correlation. Something usually done by college grads.<p>> Have you met many tradesmen?\nAny?<p>Yes I have. In fact I came from Flint, MI. You know that city that use to have a bunch of trades and union workers making cars? You know that city is pretty much dead and infested with crime. You know why? Because such workers walked out of high school, demanded high wages for menial work, and coupled with GM's miss management, caused the plants there to be wiped off the map. And, unfortunately, because the people who worked at those plants decided to forgo the ""deeply uninteresting"" education and just walk into the plant to get a job, they've screwed themselves.",1343423246

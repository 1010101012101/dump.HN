As I remember, 2 male developers were making some perhaps tasteless jokes to each other, not referencing anyone in particular. A woman seated nearby, whose job is outreach to developers like them, overheard, and decided that it would be a good idea to take a picture of them, without their permission, of course, and call them out on the internet about it. A standard gender in tech scandal ensued.<p>Sounds a lot more like an interest police out to get guys than anything to do with respect for women to me.",1401418761

(They&#x27;ll have plenty of time, as their current sole customer probably won&#x27;t want more than four a year for at least a few years.) The Shuttle was originally also intended to be quickly reused, but it failed spectacularly at doing so. However, the Dragon is not the STS, and SpaceX is not NASA. It&#x27;s a much simpler and less compromised vehicle, and when they discover pain points during recycle, I expect they will be engineered away, and quickly too. I wouldn&#x27;t bet against it being &quot;gas-and-go&quot; in 2-3 years (by which I mean requiring no more than the usual pre-flight checks.)",1401418757

This with other recent complaints may prove that Google may be stepping beyond the gray areas of a monopoly. A good lobbying may delay the process but it is inevitable.<p>OT: I don&#x27;t usually complain about votes but the amount of downvotes in this thread is appalling. Anything critical of Google has been downvoted. Ironically, if asked, most people here would be against censorship of any kind, however for many that is valid as long as the opinion stays within their perception. Under the same argument, I can &quot;predict&quot; that this post like other similar ones before is going to flagged off the frontpage. Its starting to get repetitive enough to be no longer ignored.

Google isn&#x27;t going to make people that don&#x27;t fit in the job suddenly magical at it; however, I think it&#x27;s important to recognize racial disparity as a problem that --will not fix itself if left alone--, instead of calling disgusting those who might consider an equalizing force somewhere in society to be important.<p>These numbers clearly aren&#x27;t so disparate because &quot;no reason at all&quot; or because &quot;whites are just better,&quot; so why do you think they are?

7819984,comment,7819586,7819934,9,0,mikeash,,,"Excellent question. I was wondering the same thing.<p>It seems like it must be two engines that aren&#x27;t in the same pair. If two engines in the same pair went, you&#x27;d have to cut off the opposite two to maintain symmetry, and then you&#x27;re down four. If it could handle losing four engines, you&#x27;d think he would have said that....<p>On the other hand, maybe they can lose four engines as long as their opposite each other, and he didn&#x27;t say that because it&#x27;s not <i>any</i> four. It&#x27;s not completely implausible. If each engine runs at 50% normally, then increasing the remaining four to 100% would give you the same thrust. Attitude control would be the big challenge, but perhaps smaller thrusters are able to handle it.<p>Edit: I just realized that the landing thrusters double as the launch escape system. The LES needs really high thrust to get the fragile meaty cargo as far away from the exploding rocket as quickly as possible. The Soyuz LES produces accelerations of well over 10 gees, for example. If these engines are capable of that, then they must have huge margins, as far as thrust goes, for landing. Looking over reports, I must have missed it in the stream, but Musk said that each one generates 16,000lbs of thrust. While the capsule as a whole weighs well under that... and it has <i>eight</i> engines. It also looks like the engine pairs are angled apart somewhat, which should allow for some control even on only two opposite pairs. I&#x27;m going to go ahead and guess that it can tolerate losing <i>any</i> two engines, and up to four if it&#x27;s lucky about which ones it loses.",1401418469

I don&#x27;t doubt that having a particular ethnic background helps in certain situations, but &quot;privilege&quot; suggests a certain binary-ness that doesn&#x27;t accurately capture all the nuances of race and ethnicity in America.<p>For instance, there&#x27;s a large amount of variation among different Asian groups. There is a world of difference between the socioeconomic status of the Hmong community in Michigan and the Taiwanese community in the Bay Area. Or even between the Chinese immigrants who came in the 1800s and the latter wave of immigration in the last few decades. And while it may be fair say that, all else equal, being to a particular ethnic group grants certain advantages relative to belonging to other groups, that advantage isn&#x27;t uniform. For example, being Chinese or Indian is probably a net plus if you want to be a software engineer in the valley; it&#x27;s probably a net minus if you want to be an actor in Hollywood.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think the answer is to be color-blind.

Maybe that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re talking about?<p>> First, because Parrot developers didn&#x27;t treat Rakudo as the most important hosted language.<p>Patrick&#x27;s stated justification for a multiple backend Rakudo  is explicitly grounded in Larry&#x27;s 2001 specification that Perl 6 must run on existing major VMs[2] and Patrick&#x27;s decision when he became the Perl 6 project manager in June 2009 to prepare Rakudo to run on JVM and CLR.[1]<p>That said, by the time Rakudo moved out of the Parrot repo in early 2009 there were definitely major problems with the way Parrot and Rakudo dev meshed (or not)[3] so it might have been good if Parrot <i>had</i> treated Rakudo as an important hosted language, or at least had better responded to what Rakudo actually asked for, according to the mailing lists and IRC logs from 2009 thru 2011, namely for there to be better management of breakage.[4]<p>> Second, because Parrot didn&#x27;t provide the features Rakudo wanted<p>Again, aiui, this wasn&#x27;t a stated justification for Rakudo considering multiple backends before 2009 nor was it when Patrick rewrote NQP with support for multiple backends in 2009.<p>But, yes, the growing gap between what Rakudo was saying it needed from Parrot and what Parrot actually provided must surely have led Patrick and jnthn to ponder a plan B, and spending a few years writing another VM would have been a natural thing to consider in the midst of the deteriorating Parrot situation in 2011 despite the very scary prospect of yet another huge delay in getting P6 to 6.0.<p>> I interpret {Rakudo&#x27;s} response as something other than good faith. I believe that&#x27;s why Parrot developers left; there&#x27;s no point to sticking around in that situation.<p>There were indeed clear signs of a severe breakdown in trust littered throughout 2011.<p>I think jnthn and especially Patrick really tried to solve this problem but were fighting a losing battle. I acknowledge my bias (I like Patrick and jnthn) but there are tons of examples such as Patrick drafting a formal Parrot/Rakudo relationship policy in mid 2011:<p><a href=""http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2011-July/005981.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lists.parrot.org/pipermail/parrot-dev/2011-July/00598...</a><p>(Note that there was no reply.)<p>I agree there would be no point in folk continuing to cooperate if there&#x27;s an assumption of bad faith. Typically if person/group A interprets person/group B&#x27;s actions as being done in bad faith, person/group A themselves starts acting in bad faith, or at least in a non-cooperative manner. If this attitude spreads throughout a group then all is indeed lost.<p>----<p>[1] The two Rakudo devs who matter in this context are Patrick and jnthn.<p>Patrick Michaud&#x27;s 2013 &quot;Perl on JVM&quot; talk made it clear that one of the goals of his <i></i>2009<i></i> NQP rewrite was to restructure it to support multiple backends corresponding to existing major VMs (with JVM and CLR specifically in mind).<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgPh5Li3k4g"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgPh5Li3k4g</a><p>Googling for <i>rakudo multiple backends</i> with a date filter and then doing a quick archive.org dig shows that sometime in 2009 jnthn changed the &quot;What do I do in Perl 6?&quot; section of his about page to include &quot;Transforming Rakudo from a single backend compiler to one capable of targetting multiple backends&quot;.<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20091218092004/http://jnthn.net/perl6/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20091218092004/http://jnthn.net/p...</a><p>[2] &quot;Perl 6 must not be limited to running only on platforms that can be programmed in C.

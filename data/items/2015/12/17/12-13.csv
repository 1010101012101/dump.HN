Just ask Microsoft. [1] [2]<p>Fact of the matter is, if the Metropolitan police came to Facebook with the proper paperwork requesting data on a British user as part of a criminal case, Facebook would cooperate with them.<p>> Should Whatsapp censor messages critical of Thailand&#x27;s royalty because they are illegal there?<p>No. But if Thailand decides to prosecute someone for making these statements via WhatsApp, then they have every right to legally request the data from WhatsApp. A user in Thailand broke Thai laws.<p>> Should Whatsapp censor messages that are blasphemous and thus illegal in some places?<p>Again, no. But if the jurisdiction decides to charge someone for breaking the law, WhatsApp and Facebook must cooperate with the legal request for data. To ignore such a request is circumventing due process.<p>> Should Whatsapp give up personal details of the users who have made such illegal messages?<p>Yes. If the request follows the legal process in the jurisdiction, then of course WhatsApp should be obligated to hand over the data.<p>What you&#x27;re essentially saying is that if someone in the US plans a bombing of American citizens via WhatsApp, and if the FBI finds out of this plot and decides to request the data from WhatsApp, WhatsApp has every legal right to tell the FBI to fuck off. [3]<p>Obviously this is ridiculous. Someone did something which was against the laws of their country of residence, and that country has every right to legally prosecute them for breaking the law. To claim that WhatsApp is somehow immune from this simply because they&#x27;re a foreign company operating in that country is ridiculous.<p>>  with an understanding that foreign companies will follow their laws and not yours<p>Sorry, that&#x27;s not how business works.

Thanks for your comment.<p>>>The computer shifted the complexity of our solutions from the world of atoms to the world of ideas.\n>And that&#x27;s fucking awesome! Thanks everyone that was part in making that a reality!<p>I glad you are entertained with programming. I am too! but we should judge a tool like programming by its productivity, not by it&#x27;s entertaining powers.<p>> We can create things as complex as we can logically describe them.<p>One of my points is that we can&#x27;t. To make a single app facebook needs hundreds of engineers and it is still buggy. Humans are, yet again, the weaker link in software engineering. I believe we need fundamentally better tools.<p>> It&#x27;s also incredibly difficult to create something that will acomodate everyone else&#x27;s solutions.<p>Agreed. I&#x27;d very happy with a tool that is not general purpose that could churn though CRUD systems (vast majority of systems our there) in a matter of hours without errors. If you want to something else like AI, or games or whathaveyou, use other tools built specifically for that or a programming language if none are available.<p>That CRUD tool (gross oversimplification) could be expanded with new capabilities as long as we understand those new capabilities properly.<p>> Saying programming sucks and wishfull thinking does not help anyone.

This is pretty interesting:<p>> Frozen broccoli can provide a cheaper product, with a longer shelf life and less preparation time than fresh broccoli. We previously showed that several commercially available frozen broccoli products do not retain the ability to generate the cancer-preventative agent sulforaphane. We hypothesized that this was because the necessary hydrolyzing enzyme myrosinase was destroyed during blanching, as part of the processing that frozen broccoli undergoes.<p><a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915112"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23915112</a><p>Good news, though, at least if you like radishes:<p>> Daikon radish root supported some sulforaphane formation even when heated at 125 °C for 10 min, a time and temperature comparable to or greater than microwave cooking. Daikon radish (0.25%) added to frozen broccoli that was then allowed to thaw supported sulforaphane formation without any visual alteration to that of untreated broccoli.<p>What&#x27;s more:<p>> Sulforaphane has been shown to provide cancer prevention through a number of mechanisms including the upregulation of detoxification enzymes and epigenetic changes. Optimal temperature and pH for sulforaphane formation from broccoli was determined. Sulforaphane formation was measured in three commercially frozen broccoli samples pre- and post-cooking. The results show that in these products, there was very little potential to form sulforaphane prior to cooking and essentially none after the recommended cooking method was performed.<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464613000510"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1756464613...</a><p>Looks like sprinkling some radishes, horseradish, and even wasabi revitalizes the sulforaphane production, though.<p>Not such good news for kale though - looks like we&#x27;re better off eating it fresh than frozen, indeed (in vitro, cancer cells were suppressed ~10x more with fresh <i>Brassica</i>)<p>> Brassica vegetables contain a diverse range of phytochemicals with biological properties such as antioxidant and anticancer activity. However, knowledge about how biological activities are affected by processing is lacking. A green cultivar and a red cultivar of curly kale were evaluated for water/methanol-soluble phytochemicals before and after processing involving blanching, freeze storage, and boil-in-bag heat treatment. In both kale cultivars, processing resulted in a significant decrease of total phenolics, antioxidant capacity, and content and distribution of flavonols, anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, glucosinolates, and vitamin C. Interestingly, the red curly kale cultivar had a higher capacity to withstand thermal loss of phytochemicals. The extracts of both green and red curly kale inhibited the cell proliferation of three human colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2, HT-29, and HCT 116). However, extracts from fresh plant material had a significantly stronger antiproliferative effect than extracts from processed plant material.<p><a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf300875f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jf300875f</a>",1450356175

I recommend you not to do it alone but find a local accountant in UK + an accountant in your country who knows a bit about the UK + your country rules. It is extremely easy to create a UK company, but this creates both obligations in UK <i>and</i> in your country of origin. For example, in Germany, if you are the director of a UK limited, you cannot get ""family"" health insurance, so you need to have another job or be employed by your UK limited or go private for your health insurance.<p>So, take the time to see how it affects your situation in your home country.<p>Note: It will cost you money in all the cases, it is not something you do ""just for fun"" or you are going to have problems.

3437908,comment,3437760,3437760,7,0,mikeocool,,,"A fairly unique aspect of building software products for software developers is that most of your potential customers could probably build your product if they really wanted to. And as was illustrated yesterday, if the cost is of whack with the value created, software developers will just build their own version of it.<p>Twillio is  a great example of the opposite. I don't think Twillio is actually so deep that people don't understand what's going on under the hood. Open source alternatives exist to using Twillio, like Asterisk. But setting them up and maintaining them is a massive time suck. The value Twillio creates is being able to make phone calls and send text messages immediately and never have to worry about that piece of your infrastructure. Additionally their pricing is set such that using them is over taking the time to setup something yourself is a no-brainer.<p>A nice side effect of making software for software developers, is that if you do open source something simple, someone else will find it when they're looking to save a few hours, and probably spend a little more time adjusting it to their needs and making it better. Then everyone is in a better position to use that code to build something that creates a lot of unique value and charge for it.",1325966070

- this is partly in Romanian partly in English, but you should get the point: <a href=""http://www.logec.ro/2011/12/12/ultima-prezentare-a-lui-leszek-balcerowicz-despre-cum-pune-statul-frana-cresterii-economice/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.logec.ro/2011/12/12/ultima-prezentare-a-lui-lesze...</a>
- this is for US only: <a href=""http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_20th_century_chart.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/us_20th_century_chart.ht...</a><p>What these tell me in simple words is that, more and more, some smart asses are taking decisions on our money. I really can't understand people arguing this as a good think as I can't understand how 300-1000 (representing government and parliement) persons do know better than we what we need. This trend is taking more and more from our rights to decide how, when and what we need. It also reduce the incentives to perform (as Jakab Andor put it in his article) and increase the stimulus for free rides. It also increase the chances of monopolies to develop with all the disadvantages that these are bringing (as a side note, by Misses these are the only real monopolies). Unfortunately, under current conditions, I don't believe this trend will change any time soon and we (both US and EU) have a good chance of becoming socialists with democratic hats in the next 50 years or so. This unless some major shift happens, but most probably this won't be a nice and quiet change. And, frankly, I'm not sure what freaks me out more: going in this direction or hopping for a sudden shift.<p>Secondly, I think discrimination per se is wrong and not productive. However, there are two contradictory types of laws that together increase the cost for a company: the ones that punish discriminations and the ones that adds taxes or additional costs for complying them. This leads to a natural behavior from the business side to reduce their cost. So, in this case I don't believe we are talking about discriminations per se, but about reducing costs in order to compete in a given market. In this respect, I totally agree with him. Whenever this conditions appears there's a good chance to create a black market. The size might differ from country to country based on culture, public enforcing power, the level o burden brought by regulation, but it will exist at some extent.<p>Coming back to the example with pregnant women, I don't think it's fair to say that we as a society want to stimulate birth, but ""you"" should bear the cost. It would be much fair to have this done on the society cost not on a particular business that have this case for example, not by making the employer keep the job (or bear any other costs), but by supporting women until they get a job and perform additional activities to increase their changes to get a job. I'm not saying this is what I would recommend, but I think it's much better than the alternative.<p>However, I couldn't stop noticing that Jakab Andor only mentions to ways of doing business (besides the ""do nothing"" option): struggle with a regular business model with a small margin or cheat. These are both sadly choices. I think he missed the ""think bigger"", at higher margins, be faster or smarter approach.",1325965796

Add to that whatever your state income tax is (most states have an income tax). As an example, I have to pay 4.63% to the state of Colorado. I think most states that impose an income tax are within a few percent of that. Then add the hidden employer side of payroll tax (another 6.2%), and you end up with a figure that is close to 40% of income.<p>Minimum standard deduction and a single personal exemption will remove a few percent from this figure at filing time, and you can delay tax payment through 401(k) contribution, but it is still a very heavy tax rate.

Redis is very good at producing point-in-time snapshots via RDB files, so I think the right thing to do is to create a tool, or add this feature to redis-cli, so that it is able to translate RDB files into JSON and the other way around.<p>Also I think that a ""generic"" JSON is not a good idea, since a single JSON value can be a multi million elements list or alike.

They simply pocket the money, without even issuing an invoice, it doesn't even include the VAT. They don't have to take any responsibility, there are no warranties, they officially don't even do anything, there's not even an official, legal trace of their existence. They don't have to rent an office, hire an accountant. By doing this 5 hours a day, they can easily make 1,000. They would point their middle fingers to my 760 job offer, where they wouldn't be allowed to do crappy work, but show up in time every day and meet very high professional standards in their work, they wouldn't be allowed to defraud the customers, and if they did, they would be fired.</i><p>If your business plan calls for entering a market where the going hourly rate (legal or not) is 9 and you want to charge 37, your business plan is seriously flawed to the degree that every other explanation you've provided for not starting the business is moot. You have no business plan and therefore you won't hire anyone because you have no business. Find a new market.<p><i>2- The competition would do smear campaigns against my company. I would have to face anti-capitalist propaganda, I would be seen as a greedy asshole who charges 37 for what they charge 9, I would be an enemy of the nice Hungarian people, while others work honestly for the fraction of my price...</i><p>Without knowing what business you're talking about, it's hard to view this complaint as anything more than irrational defeatism.<p><i>3- Many of my employees would only come to work for me to learn my business secrets and to steal my clients. They would lure them by lying that they will get the same value and quality of service, but at the fraction of the price. After they stole enough clients, they would deliberately cause a lot of harm to my company to get themselves fired. They would then go to court, stating that I fired them illegally, and they would win the case. In the meantime, they would of course work happily for the stolen clientele, that has cost me a fortune to build up. And of course they would be offended. They would trumpet on all kind of forums, that they have worked for my company, they know what they're talking about. Not only it is very expensive, but the service is a piece of crap too.</i><p>Granted, I'm entirely unfamiliar with Hungarian employment law, but this also sounds like irrational defeatism, or at least a failure on your part to understand best practices in documenting employee behavior. In addition, why doesn't this cataclysmic issue affect the 9/hour competition?<p><i>4- Complaining about all this wouldn't help, no one would give a flying fuck.</i><p>Complaining about real issues is one thing.

3437852,comment,3437028,3437698,11,0,dalke,,,"I looked at <a href=""http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/ZW_Rybka_Fruit.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chessvibes.com/plaatjes/rybkaevidence/ZW_Rybka_Fr...</a> . It happens to be the one mentioned as biased evidence in this chessbase article, though I picked it because it was a PDF and not an RTF file.<p>This is the the one which has a side-by-side comparison of what appears to be two pieces of code. One of which is ""static const int KnightBackRankOpening = 0;""<p><pre><code>    for (sq = 0; sq < 64; sq++) {
        P(piece,sq,Opening) += KnightRank[square_rank(sq)] * KnightBackRankOpening;
    }
</code></pre>
That appears to damning, but as the chessbase article points out, there's no source for the Rybka case, only reverse engineering. Since KnightBackRankOpening is ""static const int 0"" (can you really reverse engineer a ""const"" from machine code?), you would expect any half-decent optimizing compiler to remove that whole chunk of code.<p>In other words, this seemingly indicting code is a faade; a functionally equivalent implementation constructed to maximize similarity. Granted, the PDF does say ""The code shown here is simply the functional equivalent"" and ""Fruit and Rybka have functionally identical code here too,"" I looked at the code and the biggest similarity is that both code snippets are rendered in the same style. I don't see any copying. I see different tunings (eg, different weight parameters), and even though both tools are working in the same data representation and algorithm space, I see different implementations of those algorithms.<p>I find the chessbase article to be much more convincing than the results of the original investigation.<p>What would convince me otherwise is the same analysis of other modern chess programs, to show that they don't use the same approach.",1325964773

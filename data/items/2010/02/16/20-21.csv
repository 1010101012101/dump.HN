I looked at the ""Stupid Things We Did"" and was shocked at how stupid some of it really was considering that these people were calling themselves founders and even had investors. But then I suddenly got reminded of how I once spent a week creating a scrollbar from scratch in ActionScript for a product that nobody cares about now. I've also spent a lot of time writing my own libraries because they are cleaner/more-efficient than existing utilities out there only to throw them out completely because the specs changed. Had I used a slightly bulky off-the-shelf library, I would have saved a lot more time and could have replaced it with my own code if the library caused a bottleneck.<p>As I work on my new project now, I keep asking myself ""Is this actually going to matter to anyone except my OCD-self/ego?""

My main one is that if it <i>feels</i> different, then it is (a bit of a duck-typing mindset, understandably).<p>And if it is different, then it requires fundamentally different software application, even if the problem domain you're tackling is the same.

The word ""pitchfork"" is not something that can be trademarked and pitchfork media has no more right to the subdomain than you or I, no matter how badly they want it. So this doesn't seem like a decision Tumblr was forced into for copyright/legal reasons.

I don't blame the guy for being a bit upset. Even realizing you have no actual legal claim to something, if you've been using a url, username, twitter account, etc. for over a year and suddenly it's taken from you without so much as a warning, it would be annoying.

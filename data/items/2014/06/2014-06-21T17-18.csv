You do it as you would in C (and how all real PID 1 systems are written) -- with a single thread that starts processes, receives signals, and reaps children in a non-blocking fashion.<p>This style of program -- a program that needs to simultaneously wait for child processes/signals and fd events -- is quite awkward in Unix, but it definitely works when you get the idea.<p>To wait on a fd and a signal in a single threaded program, you would use the &quot;self pipe trick&quot; in classic Unix.  In Linux, you can ask for a signal to be delivered over a file descriptor with fdsignal().  But AFAICT there is no real reason, and portability across Unix IS a good thing IMO (but not portability to completely different OS&#x27;s like Windows; in that case I would write a completely separate program using their native APIs).<p>node.js actually does a great job making this API easy and efficient.

I&#x27;m not a native English speaker, I also make mistakes, but quite often these people just can&#x27;t communicate in English, and this , sooner or later, will become a problem for you.<p>3.

People don&#x27;t even read descriptions, they just apply everywhere.<p>4. Developers&#x27; summaries are overrated - I&#x27;ve interviewed people with &quot;more than 5 years of experience in web development&quot; etc. whose code was more like junior developer&#x27;s.<p>5. Having said that - ask people for samples of their work. The best is some OS project, because then you know it&#x27;s their code, but actually few people write OS. Anyway, reading the code, even just 2-3 simple files, helped me to reject a few developers who made good impression during the talk.<p>TL;DR: chat to see if they can use English, read their code, be sceptical about what they and their clients wrote about them.",1403370850

If there was a separate thing you could identify it.<p>You can clearly distinguish between, for example, a physics text describing how bricks are affected by gravity, and an actual brick that you can pick up in your hand. The physics text is not patentable completely regardless of how creative it is or how much work went into producing it. The brick may be patentable, e.g. if you make it out of some novel weather-resistant material.<p>The problem with software patents is that people making texts and not bricks are being accused of infringing patents.<p>>  But in reality, much like the photograph, there is a great deal more to software than that; there is thought and creativity involved in &quot;collecting&quot; those algorithms.<p>Now you&#x27;re talking about how the software is produced.

Are you suggesting that if I write a computer program that can produce other computer programs, the programs produced that way should not be able to infringe any patents because they were created deterministically without any human thought or creativity? Patents have no requirement of creativity. Again, the protection for creative works is copyright, and it applies to software as well as it does to photographs and books.<p>More to the point, analogizing software to several other things that are all indisputably <i>not</i> patentable is a very poor way of arguing that software should be patentable.",1403370797

TBL's suggestion actually makes more engineering sense to me than an IMG tag, as it wouldn't necessarily be limited to images, would be more future-proof for e.g. automated downloaders trying to discover everything needed for a cached copy of a document (all A with REL including EMBED) etc.<p>Finally, I find this bit incredibly disingenuous:<p>""I don’t know anything about this masinter guy, but he sounds like a normal, non-dick, reasonable engineer:<p>""'I think progress of HTML5 in W3C could be faster if the subsections on graphics and metadata could (if not now, then eventually) be moved to separate subgroups [...]'""<p>The crucial bit being that ""this masinter guy"" works for Adobe.

1128735,comment,1126460,1127467,0,0,tsally,,,"True, but you're really dodging the issue here which is the current dysfunctional Congress.  There have been a record number of filibusters this past year; Congress hasn't been so divided since the Civil War.  Requiring 60 votes (the number required to prevent a filibuster) to pass a bill is against the intentions of the founders.  In all cases where more than a majority is required, the founders explicitly noted the ratio (ex: the confirmation of treaties).    No ratio is specified for the passage of bills or the confirmation of appointments.  Whatever it going on in Congress today, it's not something that was intended by the founders.  Hell, filibusters weren't even put into the Senate rules until the early 1900s.<p>Personally I think the Dems should exercise the nuclear option and amend the constitution to require 3/5 for appointments to the Supreme Court.  They used to be confirmed by that much anyway; it's most been under GW Bush that we've had Court appointees pass by narrow margins.  Cliton had over 90 votes for all of his and most of Reagan's were unanimous.  GW never broke 60.",1266323154

This is simply abusive as all the ad agencies work is out in the open for the client to determine if they like it and so the pitch is simply about deciding if the advertiser can work with the agency.<p>It seems a reasonable complaint. Trying to return a sense of decency to business practices is probably a tough road though.",1266322739

My wife is an occupational therapist who works with special needs kids. She has worked in private clinics, major hospitals, contracted into schools, and currently works for a public school system. She has never hated her job until working for public schools. The bureaucracy is crushing her soul. Innovation is simply not tolerated. Rather than representing additional earning potential to her boss, innovation represents a threat to her boss's legitimacy.<p>Some of the teachers are bitter, some are just bad, and many start good and get worn down. For me, my observations of her experience add evidence that while the idea of public education is a noble one, the current model is corrosive to our society. I will not be sending my kids to the public schools in this region.",1266322687

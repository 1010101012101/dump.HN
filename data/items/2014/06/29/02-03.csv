In total she lost like 60+ pounds from her peak to where she is now.<p>She started sharing her journey and her results on social media and people literally started begging her for a &quot;DVD&quot;.<p>So after seeing the many informational type products launched and how well they do in terms of revenue, all of which are focused on some super niche (like Nathan Barry&#x27;s iOS & Web Design books that have grossed hundreds of thousands so far), I figured we could do something similar with fitness.<p>Alas, after 2+ years (I know, I cringe when I think about the time too, but it was well worth it) we finally launched and the feedback has been awesome.<p>I have launched a few products on my own, and I have read many stories about successful products with actual customers - but this is the first time I have had my own.<p>The best feeling in the world is getting emails from customers, literally thanking us for giving them the opportunity to give us their money.<p>Never thought I would ever have that experience, and even though the journey is just starting (i.e. 4 weeks ago) I am pleased with what we have done so far.",1404010565

7960219,comment,7958411,7958411,2,0,userbinator,,,"<i>Turn on the &quot;standard&quot; optimization -Os and we get the following, much more reasonable result</i><p>That&#x27;s still 250% more instructions than the necessary &quot;xor eax, eax; ret&quot;. I find it a bit disappointing that the compiler would miss this trivial optimisation opportunity, while at the same time doing subtle and often unwanted things with undefined behaviour. C was conceived as a &quot;portable assembly language&quot;, and as much as the language lawyers, theoreticists, and compiler writers love to exercise their &quot;undefined behaviour&quot; rights and try to dissuade others from thinking of it that way, that&#x27;s what people use it for and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll expect.<p>Rather, undefined behaviour should be interpreted as &quot;do the obvious thing, the results may differ on different platforms, and turn off all optimisations exploiting it because it&#x27;s either intentional or the programmer has made a mistake so the compiler should also generate obviously wrong code.&quot; A warning would be nice too. Instead of blind adherence to the standard, consider what behaviour programmers actually expect, and write compilers accordingly. One example of this is casting integers to pointers of various types, and using them to access hardware. Device drivers would be impossible to write if the compiler decided that such undefined behaviour meant it could remove the accesses completely (which is completely legal according to the standard.)<p>More examples: dereferencing a null pointer should generate code that accesses address 0. Signed integers should wrap around on overflow. Shifts should do whatever the shift instruction of the architecture does. Trying to access beyond the end of the array should try to access memory there. Division by zero will do what the machine instruction would do. Etc.",1404010485

I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s bad, but it&#x27;s never as <i>good</i> as designing from the start with the exact form factor in mind. And it&#x27;s absolutely more work for the developer. But that&#x27;s the point - Google is encouraging developers to take the easy road: not to develop a separate app but instead make a few tweaks to their phone app so that it lays out better on a tablet while not addressing the fundamental difference in scope and complexity that a tablet app can offer.",1404010064

There were at least half a dozen major web publications today putting out variants of this indignant post about &quot;Facebook&#x27;s unethical experiment&quot;. Did all these authors suddenly develop a passion for science ethics? Of course not. It is simply the internet controversy du jour. Those have never made for good HN stories, and the policy has always been to penalize them, because otherwise they would dominate the site.<p>In cases of pile-on controversy like this one, when the original story has already been discussed on HN—which is pretty common, because HN users tend not to miss a day in posting these things—we usually mark the follow-up posts as dupes unless they add important new information, or at least something of substance. Does this article add anything of substance? It didn&#x27;t strike me that way, but arguably it does.<p>As for the PR fluff piece you think is on the front page, why haven&#x27;t you flagged it?

7960197,comment,7958068,7960047,5,0,danshapiro,,,"First, two disclaimers. I&#x27;m an advisor to Highway1, and my only firsthand manufacturing experience is with a relatively straightforward boardgame, produced stateside (because after investigating overseas manufacturing I decided it was more complex than I could manage without help).<p>I don&#x27;t think this is a very accurate assessment of the problems facing startups. Most of the problems you pose can be solved in a few conversations with a good lawyer or experienced operator. If you want protection from patents, you&#x27;re likely going to be talking to the kind of folks who sell protection, like Intellectual Ventures; they&#x27;ll be happy to take your money. There are companies that specialize in managing certifications, listings, etc. These are problems you can solve with a few phone calls and a check.<p>There is, however, a do-or-die problem for most startups: it is extraordinarily hard to create a strong working relationship with a great factory.<p>First, you have to find a great factory. That requires a lot of experience and a great deal of touring, QA, reference checking, and so on. And while the good ones are great partners, the bad ones are working very hard to deceive you in to thinking they&#x27;re good.  But the worst part is that most of the best factories will have nothing to do with you because you&#x27;re too small. You don&#x27;t have the volume to be interesting yet, they are concerned you&#x27;ll go out of business, your team may not be experienced and so you&#x27;ll make mistakes that they&#x27;ll need to correct, etc.<p>Second, you need to  create a great relationship with them.  That means at least one person living there full-time.  And that person needs to have expertise in manufacturing, QA, and so on.  That person needs to feel great about their role over a very long period of time, and not everyone who moves to a new country finds it to their liking.<p>Third, you need to figure out a logistics supply chain.  A good friend, having solved both the previous problems, nearly bankrupted his company when the shipping service used the wrong kind of pen and the address rubbed off all the labels.  The return fees alone were more than the total profit on the product.<p>Companies like Apple rely on experts like PCH to do this for them. I believe most startups benefit from it too.<p>Also: PCH/Highway1 is willing and well equipped to help with most of the rest of the problems you list as well.<p>You may or may not find Highway1 to be a good fit for your needs but unless you&#x27;re very experienced in overseas manufacturing and/or doing something truly trivial, I believe you&#x27;ll have more challenges with manufacturing than you suspect.",1404009731
7960196,comment,7960099,7960099,2,0,onetimeusename,,,"As a person with a degree in CS I have to say this is bogus.<p>The writer doesn&#x27;t explicitly state what CS skills are but he says they will be outsourced.  I take it he thinks CS means you only learn basic programming or how to install software.  He then says it is good to spend time in the lab learning how stuff works.  I had to learn plenty about how computers work from low level details to theory of computation to high level specifics of software design.<p>His second part about languages coming and going so therefore don&#x27;t study languages?? seems odd since someone is apparently making all the new languages. Apart from that, understanding concepts such as oop or functional &#x27;paradigms&#x27; are not as easy to wing although admittedly things are becoming freely available on the web.<p>Then he said people who build OS&#x27;s are ditch diggers but if you look at how hardware has changed, building software that can handle different devices and allowing them to interact with the OS is huge!  Just look at the evolution of super computers that physicists use.  From vector processors to multicore cpu to gpgpu, there needs to be people who understand computer science to work on these things because computers require someone to know about computation itself.<p>Lastly, I had to learn computer architecture, physics up to quantum mechanics, and I had to take all sorts of deep math courses so the writer is completely wrong about the CS major.<p>[edit] and I forgot to add in algorithms and data structures which are themselves deep topics and no, algorithms are not useless, knowing which algo or data structure to use can save a lot of time and therefore money.  I should say that theory of computation and algorithms really distinguish the major and add that currently in demand are skills such as machine learning or data mining which are subsets of the CS field.<p>If I was to give a reason not to major in CS it might be that the degree is very popular right now and the demand for the degree might at some point be larger than the demand for persons with the degree.",1404009660

7960152,comment,7956627,7959978,1,0,tel,,,"An unassigned variable in C is not &quot;an unknown&quot;, though it is (as an adjective) unknown. It&#x27;s uninitialized and thus equal to some value though it must be initialized first in order to be useful since only then do we know how to predict its behavior.<p>To break down the difference, consider the idea of names versus the idea of &quot;boxes&quot; or &quot;slots&quot;. In some languages those two concepts are undistinguishable because names always refer to locations in memory. In &quot;functional&quot;[1] languages they are separate.<p>As an example, consider a function in a hypothetical language<p><pre><code>    def foo (y, x):\n      let z = get(x)\n      assign(x, y*y+z)\n</code></pre>\nThe (side) effect of this function is merely to update the value stored in the <i>slot</i> named `x` using a function of the value named `y`. To do so, we read from the slot `x`, bind a local name `z` with that value, and then assign back to the slot named `x`. We would call it in a block like this<p><pre><code>    let box = newBox(1)\n    let inp = 3\n    foo(box, inp)\n    let newVal = get(box)\n    print(newVal)\n</code></pre>\nand it would print `7` (3*3+1).<p>I&#x27;m being really explicit about the idea of things being &quot;named&quot; by variables instead of just &quot;being&quot; variables. I&#x27;m also being really explicit about the notion of how boxes undergo mutation. The reason I do this is to isolate this &quot;naming&quot; property and show how simple it is. Variables-as-unknowns are merely names of values given to them in some context. Usually this is either a function abstraction or a let<p><pre><code>    let x = 3\n    # now, here, the name `x` refers to a value `3`\n\n    def foo(x):\n      # now, here, the name `x` refers to some value that\n      # will later be passed to `foo`\n</code></pre>\nIf we need mutation we have to introduce the box idea noted earlier.

However, CAcert has never (to my knowledge) even <i>attempted</i> to engage in one of those audits, and my understanding is that CAcert is attempting to create a system whereby they can operate without requiring a WebTrust audit -- so it&#x27;s hardly reasonable to bring up the cost of an audit that&#x27;s never been done, and will never be done.<p>It would be extremely hubristic of me to try and &quot;take over&quot; CAcert with the intention of trying to get it well-trusted by browsers.  Either the organisation as it currently stands doesn&#x27;t <i>want</i> to be in the trust stores (in which case, I&#x27;d essentially be destroying the organisation as it currently exists in order to make a new one from its ashes) or the organisation <i>does</i> want it, but the people currently working on the problem haven&#x27;t worked out how, within the constraints the organisation has willingly placed on itself -- in which case, why do you think I&#x27;m that much smarter than the collective wisdom and experience of everyone, past and present, who has been involved with CAcert?  Why would I have the silver bullet to work out how to satisfy the inclusion criteria of the browsers, within the boundaries the organisation has chosen to operate within?<p>My reasons for investigating the SSL co-op model have nothing to do with CAcert&#x27;s governance -- from the outside, CAcert appears to be quite reasonably governed.  They&#x27;re to do with the feasibility of becoming a widely-trusted (by browsers, etc) root CA, given the current <i>operational</i> model.  Given that I think the operational model needs to be completely different, the value of the existing infrastructure and user/assurer base to a root CA with a completely different operational model is, to be blunt, zero.<p>The SSL co-op will also explicitly <i>not</i> be an &quot;undermanned community based authority&quot;.  It will be operated on a solid commercial basis (please bear in mind that &quot;commercial&quot; does not equal &quot;for profit&quot;), and its budget will include funds to pay for staff to operate the CA and all the associated bumf.  If the co-op cannot be run on a commercial basis, it will not be run, at least with my involvement.<p>And finally, I don&#x27;t want CAcert to go away.  I feel there is a strong need for more diversity in how CAs are operated, and the SSL co-op is merely the first step in that direction.  I&#x27;d like to leverage the co-op&#x27;s success to make it easier for alternatives like CAcert to be a part of the &quot;in crowd&quot; in the future.",1404007756

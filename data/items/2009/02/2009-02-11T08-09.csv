The number is higher than your calculation because we don't all work 9-5, we're commiting frequently from around 8am to 9pm. We also run builds repeatedly overnight to flush out any intermittently failing tests we may have recently introduced. We'll run the builds as fast as they can go from 2am-4am.",1234342613

The only grades were ""needs to improve"" and ""is progressing fine"".<p>Guess what, it didn't work: they did away with any incentive for students to really improve. Overall knowledge and performance of students went down.<p>I conceptually agree that grades are not proper for an evaluation system. But the alternative can be worse! I hope they really, really worked out and tested an alternative that wasn't just <i>politically correct</i> or <i>fair</i> (ugh) but rather, a proper, better evaluation system.",1234341281
476753,comment,475958,476229,0,0,herval,,,"I actually went the other way around and used both Django and Rails as means to learn (or get deeper) in Python/Ruby languages. Both frameworks do a great work on abstracting bits of the language, which IMHO made it easier to start (I tried getting Python a couple of years before but gave up since I didn't have a good 'hello world' idea to keep me motivated - being able to build some useful web app also helped, when learning along with the framework)",1234341242
476752,comment,474919,475133,0,0,miked,,,"Back in the '80s I was the first person in my CS dept to champion the idea of OOP. It wasn't some conspiracy to make money (not a bad thing) selling a fresh set of buzzwords (that would be a bad thing). My views were strongly influenced by the views of writer Michael Jackson, who pointed out that every program contains a model -- at varying levels of explicitness -- of its domain. OOP just seemed to make the model clearer by creating a more explicit mapping between the objects in the world and those in the program. Grady Booch and Bertrand Meyer later made similar arguments specifically about OOP.<p>What happened next was that an idea that worked well in a few contexts (discrete simulation and graphics/GUIs) was expanded to almost all kinds of programming where it didn't work as well. That's because a lot of the world-to-be-modeled is more verb than noun. That in turn means that functions will make better models than objects.<p>I now think that Lisp-class functional languages (using, say, Clojure) are better for most programs. The reason, as pg has pointed out, is succinctness. The problem with OOP is that it's hard for it to be succinct because new data types are constantly being created and new methods added to them, all of which requires extra code.<p>All programs are programs about a particular domain. Programs become succinct when the language being used can be sculpted to the domain at hand. That's best done in languages with macros and a simple (e.g., s-expression) syntax.<p>One last point. I've looked for many years for the One True Programming Paradigm. I no longer believe that any such thing exists. Different classes of problems simply require different approaches. What I've come home to is using a language that allows easy creation of DSLs and controls side-effects, while still allowing them. A <i>wet clay language</i> that allows experimentation and sculpting to the domain at hand. Lisp-class languages do this best, with Clojure at the top of the heap in my opinion.<p>I still think that OOP is best for GUIs, where state is inherent in the domain and inheritance can pay off big.",1234341187

Kids wrote programs on their Commodores, Ataris, and TI calculators because the environment was already setup.

If  Commodores or Amigas were available today, I'd buy one for  my 5 year old nephew so that he could fiddle around with it, play some simple games, write some small programs  and so on.<p>Maybe there is a market for a small computing device that has the ""instantly have something running, but is completely hackable"" characteristic.",1234340731

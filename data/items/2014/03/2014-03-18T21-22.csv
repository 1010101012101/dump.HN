Below are some reasons I find it useful/fun and which onboard/Android app I use.<p>(Builtin/Glance) Receiving text messages on your wrist (and having custom preset replies) is great. Especially when you are on the move, commuting, in company or a meeting. It does take some time to know how to look at your phone without seeming like you are being rude and checking the time - but my acquaintances know what I am doing, and like my phone, I know when not to react to incoming notifications.<p>(Glance/Tasker) The Glance app with Tasker allow you to make a button on your phone interact with literally anything your phone can. Send an API call to a remote server, silence the phone, send an sms with your current lag/long in a google map link all withing two button presses. It&#x27;s insane.<p>(PebbleDialer) lets you see who is calling and mute, hang up, or pick up. Also great when you are commuting with a headset.<p>(PebbleBike) is like having a bikecomputer on your hand, but whenever. And it stores your trip. If you are interested in the &#x27;social&#x27; aspect then Strava and RunKeeper are meant to work too.<p>(Builtin) The built in music app is fantastic if you don&#x27;t have a headset, or need to know the music - but really, it is bloody amazing when you are at home and playing music through your phone (or have your phone linked to XMBC!) and need to pause or wish to skip tracks.<p>(Glance) I never lose my phone around the house. Two buttons and the volume goes to full and it plays a soundfile.<p>(Tasker) My phone is unlocked while connected to Pebble with bluetooth, and locks otherwise (except on home wifi)<p>(Glance) The weather update is actually great. &quot;What&#x27;s the weather outside?&quot; can be answered with a glance at your wrist.<p>(Glance/Tasker/SoundHound) Knowing what song is playing without fiddling with your phone at the pub is good. Most impressive is that SoundHound can recognise songs while the phone is in my pocket.<p>For me, it has also meant that I am not checking my phone constantly for new emails. In fact, now I only have particular filtered labels from gmail sent to my watch, and the rest do not even notify.<p>Most of the good 3rd party apps are free, but accept donations which I&#x27;ve been more than happy to contribute to.<p>I can live without it, but a year on I am still enjoying it immensely.",1395179966

It&#x27;s easy as a developer to underestimate the difficulty of getting things set up.  Even in nitrous the most common problem I have to debug during class is  people not being in the right directory because they have to use &#x27;cd workspace&#x27; before they can &#x27;ruby helloworld.rb&#x27;.  There&#x27;s just a giant set of knowledge that we developers rely on to even do the simplest of tasks, and nitrous lets me skip over all that boring stuff and get right to the interesting concepts they can see on their screen like paths, params, request handlers, views and links.<p>My only complaint is the onboarding UX uses some confusing wording/concepts for beginners like &quot;boxes&quot; and &quot;hostnames&quot; and energy credits.  I just handhold everyone through that part so it must be really difficult for someone trying to load it up themselves.

For one of those, calls go straight to an Amdocs domain on an AS hosted outside of the carrier. Of course, few people will see these now since Google Play canned external billing APIs (removing most of the interest here) and most new projects choose to access carrier billing via international aggregators (since integrating with one carrier can take months of pain, if you even have enough of a case to bother, and if they even talk to you). For NFC stuff, most US carriers are combining forces to produce a new API which will effectively similarly distance any integrators. The reason I got a look was we were developing the flagship app for Samsung Galaxy series device launch in the US, and the carriers were all on board with it.<p>An older, long term IT veteran friend of mine who recently retired in Australia and chaired the mobile phone number portability multi-carrier technical implementation roundtable told me he was essentially fired (contract not renewed) for opening up an inquiry in to the wasteful billing practices at one particular Australian carrier. It turned out they were using Amdocs. He described making a decision, being forced to sit through a presentation, making the same decision, being forced to sit through another presentation, until the end of this contract period.<p>This and other sources concur: the Amdocs billing stuff&#x27;s like cancer. Once they&#x27;re in your network, you can&#x27;t get rid of them. If I were a national privacy authority or the European Data Protection Supervisor, I&#x27;d walk in to all my carriers, seize all third party billing systems, dump out disk images, and analyze them top to bottom in a nationally transparent, multi-party audit citing national security / privacy.",1395179570

So you can do this to import a specific version of say yaml<p><pre><code>    import &quot;gopkg.in/v1/yaml&quot;\n</code></pre>\nor for an arbitrary url on github<p><pre><code>    https://gopkg.in/username/v1.0.0/pkg\n</code></pre>\nWeird that versions are before the pkg name though, that doesn&#x27;t seem right...<p>Here&#x27;s hoping this sort of versioning scheme makes it into the go toolchain eventually. The only downside of this solution is it redirects only to github and guesses urls, I quite like that the go toolchain is indifferent as to where the sources are hosted. This would be very easy to add to the toolchain though; all they&#x27;d need to do is recognise imports like this (personally I prefer versions at the end of current urls, not in the middle):<p><pre><code>   import &quot;bitbucket.org/user/pkg/v1.1.2&quot;\n</code></pre>\nin go get and download that tag to that path, no other changes in the toolchain would be required, and those who ignore versions could continue to do so, while people who wanted them use the version specific imports. I think the objection of the go team was that this doesn&#x27;t solve any of the complex dependency issues that plague package managers, but it&#x27;d be nice just to be able to specify which version is expected for future users and have predictable builds when sharing code outside one org.",1395179480

Seeing the discussion of Bitcoins here on Hacker News reminds me of early online discussions in the 1990s of online payment systems such as PayPal, and the arguments beforehand that PayPal wouldn&#x27;t have to invest a lot of time and effort (as it eventually did) building defenses against theft and fraud.

So, if the plane did go down in the 30 minute block between the ACARS transmission, AND AFTER the sign off, it would easily explain the radio silence, because the plane wasn&#x27;t silent, it just wasn&#x27;t transmitting & was not visible to secondary radar.<p>Obviously, this means the plane had to go down very quickly (because it had so much altitude) and while being a consolidated mass (blown up or shattered planes scatter debris which are easily identified). It&#x27;s very possible they suffered from an electrical failure from a fire, but it&#x27;s much more plausible there was some control surface failure. For example in Alaska Airlines 261&#x27;s case the horizontal stabilizer jack-screw failed unconstraining the entire horizontal stabilizer causing the plane immediately dive 31,000ft and hit the water in under 5 minutes.",1395178510

7425151,comment,7419448,7422246,2,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Couple that with the fact that he saw C# and .NET for what it was, Java done right</i><p>C# has been a step up over Java, while .NET went in the other direction, getting all the things that Java got right backwards. In spite of .NET being heralded as the second coming of Java back in 2003, Java is stronger than ever and the ecosystem is probably much bigger than .NET will ever be.<p>The problem that Microsoft always had, and I don&#x27;t fully understand the dynamics at play here, is with the ecosystem they&#x27;ve grown. Whether this was on purpose, or due to platform limitations, or it just happened because they attracted the wrong kind of expectations, or maybe because of cultural issues, is up for debate. But the fact is the ecosystem is extremely weak and filled with snake oil offerings, with .NET developers waiting for Microsoft to throw solutions over the wall for everything, while complaining about Java&#x27;s fragmentation, when in fact Java&#x27;s fragmentation is its bigger strength, as it&#x27;s based on open-source that survives and competes and evolves and is a much healthier situation than the clusterfuck that happens when a paternalistic company is in charge, like with Windows Forms/XAML/Silverlight/HTML5.<p>Yes, Java as a language sucks, but focusing on that while ignoring the JVM and the whole ecosystem around it is a pretty shallow comparisson. Hats off to Miguel, he saw something that he liked and built his own version. But for devs looking to make choices, without imposed constraints, picking .NET over Java makes no sense whatsoever.<p>Even the original motto, with .NET being a runtime for multiple languages whereas Java was a language for multiple platforms proved in the end to be false. The JVM is not only multi-platform, but technically speaking it is much better at hosting other languages, with proof being the alternative languages implementations such as Clojure, Scala, JRuby, Jython, Groovy and Rhino, all of them popular and with healthy communities.<p>Here&#x27;s what Erik Meijer has to say about Scala, btw: <a href=""https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/438355100310831104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/headinthebox/status/438355100310831104</a><p>Here&#x27;s what the Java ecosystem routinely does, as open-source: <a href=""http://www.robovm.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.robovm.com/</a> ; <a href=""http://oss.readytalk.com/avian/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oss.readytalk.com/avian/</a> ; <a href=""https://github.com/google/j2objc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/j2objc</a><p>And here&#x27;s the best IDE ever, coming from the same people that are making Visual Studio usable: <a href=""http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</a>",1395178471

I will say that, speaking as a graphics programmer who has been writing advanced renderers for more than 20 years, I do think the sense of your comment is wrong. In my working life alone, I have seen the state of the art progress from 4-color pixelated 2D, to the current Frostbite/Unreal level engines. I believe that already crosses most of the gap from nothing, to photorealism. I am also thinking more about rendering than all the other things people are discussing in this thread. I also do not think the incredible and dramatic progress in rendering can be sensibly compared to the ongoing slow progress in AGI. Again, we all know that with graphics, it&#x27;s all an approximation. Perhaps you, being of a later generation, have much higher standards.

Gerald Sussman seems to agree as he often looks to biology for new ideas. Ideas are not born in a vacuum after all. They need to form hunches and meet other hunches and be given time to cook. That&#x27;s a number of metaphors... but I think you get where I&#x27;m going with this. I hope.<p>Spend time learning the fundamentals for sure but branch out as soon as you can.",1395176633

Upgrade to 3x32&quot; is underway, so I can not provide data for those.

I also use virtual desktops to switch window layout for various tasks. For example I consume twitter and rss feeds in separate configuration.<p>I am not saying everyone would benefit from this setup. I analyze large heap dumps and do lot of concurrent debugging. But quiet office, decent screen and chair should be a starter for any self respecting programmer.",1395176623

Does that loss exceed the cost? This would vary by municipality of course. But, I am more likely to spend money and buy things if there is easier parking. For example, grocery shopping. If I have two kids and have to have the stroller plus carry my purchases home on a subway, that is a disincentive compared to a place that offers adequate parking. If freezing in the cold waiting for a bus is my only access option for office space, then I am disinclined to rent that office space.

8711836,comment,8711162,8711481,0,0,nkurz,,,"What do you mean when you say that standard memory doesn&#x27;t support concurrent accesses?  Assume you have 2 threads running on 2 (physical) cores on a single-socket machine.  In what case would the data access be serialized?  How much do you think this serialization would affect the latency of a read from memory?<p>For current Intel, all cores in a socket share L3 cache, but have independent L1 and L2.  If the two are using the same address read-only, both will have the data in their own L1.  If they are read-write, performance will drop, but there still won&#x27;t be any accesses to RAM, and the data will stay in L3.<p>If you are talking about random access, there can be concurrent access on either 2, 3, or 4 &quot;channels&quot;. This is physically partitioned, so sometimes data can truly be accessed in parallel and sometimes it can&#x27;t.  But the maximum wait time for a request to be held up is small relative to the total latency of a memory access.<p>The &quot;two cores at most&quot; part of the saturation statement is trivially untrue, although correct for many systems.  On the Sandy Bridge system I just checked (quad-channel DDR3 1600), I did get a small increase on the Stream benchmark going from 2 to 3 physical cores: 15 GB/s Copy for one core, 23 GB/s for two, 25 GB/s for three.<p>But this overstates the problem somewhat, as perfectly predictable access with prefetch isn&#x27;t particularly common.  For random access, it is difficult to saturate RAM bandwidth unless you pay very close attention to the parallelization of your requests.  For dependent access (each request depends on the previous) I&#x27;m doubtful that you&#x27;d be able to reach saturation on most processors.<p>I agree with your sentiment though --- it&#x27;s tough to get the performance increase you&#x27;d hope for unless the threads, and paying close attention to data access patterns is key.  But I&#x27;d argue (and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d agree) that managing data access is crucial to single threaded performance as well.",1417948955

(And if not memory-bound, then of course a lot more still)<p>Main memory is high-latency, and single threads usually don&#x27;t saturate the bandwidth because they are not issuing back to back pipelined requests to memory. The CPU has a single shared memory controller and it sees requests from all cores/SMTs. A desktop x86 might support 16 outstanding cache misses that might come from different cores or SMT &quot;threads&quot;, and is designed to keep the memory channels busy and request pipelines full by scheduling in work from all the cores/SMTs, doing prefetching according to the big picture etc.<p>Even multiple threads accessing the same data doesn&#x27;t actually look different from the DIMM point of view, all the x86 synchronization takes place inside the CPU caches and is invisible in the main memory traffic/requests. (This is true even on multi-socket systems, the caches just talk to each other using an inter-CPU bus).<p>Also, desktop/server systems typically have more than one independent memory channel, in beefy servers a whole lot of them",1417948762

I think this because open-sourcing code does not only increase one&#x27;s own personal freedom (which is unlikely to be exercised alone due to the magnitude of the task), but more realistically it allows the opportunity for an outside skilled individual or group to be looking over the code, and the benefits can be transferred to all users of the software.<p>It is akin to a person&#x27;s relationship to the law, where legal writing is not designed for common consumption, but professionals or organizations may digest and disseminate the data to interested groups.

8711791,comment,8710006,8710244,0,0,iron_codex,,,"Maybe a lightweight proxy server (running a r-Pi? or another headless server) on your network and routing traffic through it? I offer this as an extension to my  post many comments down, which basically covers my belief that you must first filter/proxy the mind. Not trying to control how to hand everything the world has available but instead only allowing yourself to focus on what you need available and saying <i>no</i> to the rest.<p>Anyways, it&#x27;s bit of a time consumer setting up said software initially but you benefit from a lot of angles once done. (Network security, content management, less likely to back track on systems that take more work to implement, as well as having a sophisticated and global system across all devices routed through the proxy server.) I believe some software packages even allow for the management of access times as well as content type. White list only a couple sites/ url&#x27;s / IP&#x27;s you use and white list them for only the time you need to be able to use them. Have someone else change the computer password on the server that you trust and boom. Just don&#x27;t get distracted trying to circumvent security now...ha ha<p>Just a casual suggestion based upon experience as a school system  administrator. Normally though if I am having a problem that starts in the mind, I develop a solution  that either starts there or starts at whatever triggers it in my mind. Just a thought.

This has been known for over a decade. Eg, <a href=""http://www.cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/2005/back1305.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cis.org/sites/cis.org/files/articles/2005/back130...</a> concludes &quot;&quot;&quot;Overwhelmingly, the H-1B program is used to import workers at the very bottom of the wage scale. The wide gap between wages for U.S. workers and H-1B workers helps explain why industry demand for H-1B workers is so high and why the annual visa quotas are being exhausted.<p>Many in industry have called for an increase in the number of H-1B visas, citing the early exhaustion of the cap as reflective of widespread need for skilled workers. However, the fact that very few H-1B workers are earning salaries as high as U.S. workers in the same profession would seem to refute that claim, and should make lawmakers wary of increasing the H-1B quota. The exhaustion of the H-1B quota may reflect employers&#x27; interest in lowering labor costs or widespread fraud rather than an insufficient number of visas.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>HN comments include those of <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8656028"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8656028</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7372574"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7372574</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3689383"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3689383</a> , <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5804016"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5804016</a> and more .. again, search HN for &quot;shortage&quot;.",1417946806

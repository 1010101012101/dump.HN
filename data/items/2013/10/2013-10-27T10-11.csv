I&#x27;m honestly not sure!&quot; They often say that about assembly, and I think I may have to pull my foot out one day and learn it.<p>The C programming mindset requires one to think like a machine. Very few people are born with that skill, it has to be beaten into programmers with a keyboard.<p>BTW I only started learning coding last year, but I started with C++. Did you do the same or jump straight to C? I tend to agree more with Stallman and Torvalds these days: &quot;A horrible language&quot;.",1382871576

Also, different data sets and different methodologies give different results. For instance, the 2007 paper in [2] found much lower patenting rates in software than did the 2008 survey in [1].<p>Yet the patent possession/success correlation is hard to doubt. In addition to [2] and [3], there are other papers, such as by Rosemary Zeidonis, that also show a robust correlation between patenting and eventual success in high tech industries. Also, there&#x27;s a working paper by a Pepperdine professor showing firms with patents <i>four times</i> more likely to succeed. I linked [2] particularly because it has a greater focus on the software industry.<p>I do agree that Twitter&#x27;s strength is in network effects, and so is less likely to be affected by issues affecting other startups. Just trying to show some numbers to explain why (some) investors see the lack of patents as worrying.<p>However, the argument that the Innovators&#x27;s Patent Agreement will attract the &quot;best and brightest&quot; is a false premise, handily disproved by Google and Facebook, just to pick two. It will attract a certain type of talent, maybe something Twitter is particularly looking for, but &quot;best and brightest&quot; is not necessarily it.",1382870854

In an unregulated, un-subsidized, purely private telecommunications market, you would have no right to do anything the provider doesn&#x27;t want you to.<p>Because there is such a high barrier to entry for basic telecoms infrastructure, this would be extremely problematic for society, and the infrastructure is regulated to prevent the companies from interfering with speech just because they don&#x27;t like its content.<p>Facebook is not infrastructure. The infrastructure used to communicate with it can also be used to freely communicate with any other person or service, with a very low barrier to entry. Witness now, you and I and many others are communicating on this very site without any involvement of Facebook whatsoever. Many people use Twitter, Google+, Tumblr, good ol&#x27; email, SMS, and various IM services to communicate entirely separate from Facebook.

6621518,comment,6621094,6621442,4,0,gjulianm,,,"The ZFC axiom set [1] doesn&#x27;t define a made-up world. Actually, once you understand the axioms (they&#x27;re somewhat difficult in notation and definitions, but the ideas behind are understandable) they make sense. There are some axioms made to avoid paradoxes (notably ZFC3 [2]), but the majority describe how we understand the world. It&#x27;d be difficult to imagine a world where two sets aren&#x27;t equal even when they have the same elements, or where you couldn&#x27;t construct a set that contains all elements of two other sets.<p>How&#x27;s this different to a set of <i>facts</i> as you say, like one unit + one unit is two units? It&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m not sure of this, but I&#x27;d say you could construct a set of axioms based on those <i>facts</i> that is compatible with the ZFC axiom set.<p>So, why choose ZFC? Because it&#x27;s simple to define (how&#x27;d you formally define what is a unit, and what does the + operation mean?) and because it&#x27;s more or less consistent with our world. We can extrapolate the things we find while doing mathematics to the real world. And, sometimes, we can discover things of the real world based on findings on things that don&#x27;t <i>exist</i>. Complex numbers, for example: they don&#x27;t exist, but they&#x27;re really useful to define and explain electrical experiments [3].<p>We approach <i>all of mathematics</i> like this because its easier to study everything within the same system. And it&#x27;s important that we keep a consistent underlying system so we can be sure that everything we discover based on the set of axioms and rules we&#x27;ve defined is <i>true</i> in a mathematical sense; and then those discoveries could describe our world. Wouldn&#x27;t we have a consistent system, we could end up with contradictions. If we extracted mathematical concepts from the real world, we wouldn&#x27;t be sure if a <i>discovery</i> we make from those concepts can be applied to the real world.<p>TL;DR: Our set of axioms describes properly the real world, is simple and consistent enough and that enables us to infer new ideas that can be applicable to the real world too.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_th...</a>

It is obvious, however, that orthogonal and irrefutable do not mean &quot;true&quot;.

It uses about as much as Windows would use.<p>I actually had to try a bunch of Linux distros for an old Atom  netbook with 1 GB of RAM. The one with the lowest resource usage was Zorin OS Lite 7.1 which uses 0-1 percent CPU when doing nothing, or even with the system monitor on, and ~100 MB of RAM. Zorin Lite is based on LXDE/Lubuntu, so I assume Lubuntu uses about as much, but I didn&#x27;t try it anymore, because I don&#x27;t really like the default LXDE interface, and I like Zorin&#x27;s more.<p>The one with relatively low CPU (5 percent doing nothing( and RAM usage (140 MB) that I liked most was Linux Lite, with its XFCE-based interface. The slightly extra resources it needed were a noticeable a little when trying to open stuff, compared to Zorin Lite, but not a significant slowdown (still much smaller than what I see with Elementary in the video).<p>I could&#x27;ve lived with that, because I really liked the interface, but unfortunately for some reason it doesn&#x27;t recognize the keyboard properly, and for some keys, instead of typing the letters on them, it would type the numbers on them. Maybe they can get it fixed with the next version that will be based on 14.04 LTS (they only base it on LTS versions).<p>Super lightweight distros like Puppy and others that run in RAM are a non-starter for me, because they have really ugly, non-intuitive interfaces, and I actually want to use apps like Chrome and so on.<p><a href=""http://zorin-os.com/lite.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://zorin-os.com/lite.html</a><p><a href=""https://www.linuxliteos.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.linuxliteos.com/</a>",1382870013

7281620,comment,7281464,7281464,1,0,yeukhon,,,"There is always politics in any workplace, any organization.<p>My first thought is to have meetings where you and your team make a list of problems that you guys are facing (is logging not enough? is disk filling up quickly? is it getting hard to maintain some part of the code, etc). Don&#x27;t go overboard. People who are much more senior than you are in this organization have pride. Imagine you worked your way up and did most of the coding and suddenly a new hire called your code shitty and ugly and non-functional, that hurt. Also, some people fear of breaking system. School in particular hates it. They don&#x27;t care; students don&#x27;t care. If school&#x27;s portal is down for more than 1 hour, someone is gonna get an ugly call from some executive admin.<p>I can say testing, MVC patterns, all that shit (excuse my french here, in your manager&#x27;s hypothetical voice) are least priority. What are your priority. Prove SQLi. Then fix it. Are there documentations for how to set up a server running the software you guys are working on? Is it done with a shell script. If so, is it working?<p>Testing and new development patterns shouldn&#x27;t be your priority. They are cultural. You can&#x27;t build Rome in one day unless you have all the people behind your back.<p>Scrum style, sure, but do it slowly. Also, this may sound extreme, but sometimes, you need to play a bit dumb. Don&#x27;t show off. Some people can&#x27;t face the fact they are out of the league... sometimes playing dumb/doing things a little slow can make things smoother.",1393063097

7281612,comment,7281063,7281313,5,0,dasil003,,,"We often criticize companies for being blind-sided by an innovator coming up behind (ie. Microsoft with the web), but in this case I think we have the opposite problem of Google dropping everything to try to become Facebook.<p>Your reasoning about the potential threat of Facebook is of course totally cogent, and indeed Facebook <i>could</i> be a threat to Google&#x27;s business.  The only problem is that they haven&#x27;t proven there&#x27;s a way to monetize that word-of-mouth that Facebook technologizes so well (because of course it&#x27;s always existed).  In fact there&#x27;s a strong argument to be made that it is impossible to monetize this phenomenon without destroying it.  Facebook is throwing everything they have at this problem, but they have still not crossed the chasm.  The state of play today is that AdWords are expensive because of the ROI they can drive, and Facebook tend to be cheap, yet still overpriced due to a wave of hype that has crested but still hasn&#x27;t washed away back to sanity yet.  And when the smoke clears will Facebook&#x27;s model be more valuable than Google&#x27;s?  I think that&#x27;s anything but a foregone conclusion.<p>Given the uncertainty of the winning model, I&#x27;d rather see Google stay true to their DNA rather than chase after the Facebook hype with the G+ strategy.  Some good has come out of it in terms of improving their authentication across properties, but by and large it appears as an impotent move to recreate a second-class implementation of Facebook that no one gives a shit about.  Meanwhile, Google actually has tons of properties that Facebook can&#x27;t touch.  So why are they chasing after an upstart?  I consider it a sign of weakness and ultimately detrimental to try to shift your company culture like this.  If you&#x27;re on top with a certain strategy, do your best to ride that wave instead of running scared and trying to compete with someone else on their terms.  It&#x27;s a sign of weakness, and only should be pursued when the company is in real trouble, not based on attempted clairvoyance.",1393062905

7281597,comment,7281063,7281313,1,0,XorNot,,,"I think this analysis is inaccurate.<p>The thing about Facebook advertising, and the reason it struggles with monetization, is Facebook knows nothing of what people <i>want</i>. Moreover, there&#x27;s a ton of stuff people will never post about wanting to Facebook (privacy is a big issue there - from friends and family).<p>The best Facebook can do is classify people into narrower demographic bands, but then spam the range of advertising for that band at them. It is not good at it - I&#x27;m under-30, ergo clearly I should be sent ads for alcohol and travel. Regardless of time of day or what I&#x27;m doing at the moment.<p>Facebook can also never not show you ads - they don&#x27;t know intent, at the moment, so they have to try and catch the rare sellable moments throughout the day of a person, whereas Google knows when you search that you&#x27;re searching for that exact thing right now. Which means they can filter a lot of ads which would otherwise make people suspicious of the advertising because they don&#x27;t have to show you anything when they have nothing interesting to show you.<p>Moreover, the type of advertising you suggest Facebook leverage is a giant catastrof<i></i>* of possible legal issues with using people&#x27;s likeness without permission. To what level of social graph depth are they going to do that?

Just as there are very good programmers there are also very bad ones. Trying to make a bad programmer into a good one often ends up in a catch 22 - he would already be a good one if not for all the constants in equation that makes him a bad one. My advice number 1 is this: move on, find a team of solid professionals. Advice number 2: dump PHP, learn a more serious language like Java, Scala, Clojure or C/C++ if a lower level is in your interest. It just so happens that often guys who work with those languages tend to be better than guys who work with PHP.",1393061981

I just wanted Excel and Word - now I have Microsoft Messenger, Microsoft Remote Desktop, Microsoft Connection Manager(?!), Microsoft Communicator, Microsoft Office Setup Manager, Microsoft Document Connection, and the complementary launch agent &quot;com.microsoft.office.licensing.helper&quot;.<p>Best thing: They plastered my dock with app icons that I just couldn&#x27;t drag out of the dock to delete them. I had to go the rightclick->submenu->&quot;remove from dock&quot; route for every of the ~10 icons. Now why would they do this? So the typical Mac user won&#x27;t be able to remove them because the default way to remove them doesn&#x27;t work?<p>MS truly lives and breathes bloatware.",1393059773

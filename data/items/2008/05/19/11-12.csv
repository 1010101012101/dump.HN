I was getting tired of all of the articles PG wrote about startups - if you ask me, that was too much of a good-but-not-very-good-thing.<p>If I were to start a startup, I would find some of Paul Graham's advice useful, but also, due to its size, it became a very big and incoherent potato mash in my head. :-)<p>So I hope to see more essays and articles by Graham about non-startup stuff. I have some good ideas for open-source-but-commercial ventures - not all of them FOSS related, and may eventually become a ""professional"" webmaster/blogger (= someone who makes a living out of it).   But still I find that I'd rather hear general software management and software-development advice and philosophy than something specific to startups.<p>So I'm glad PG is back to more diverse essaying and wish him the best of luck.",1211198304

193986,comment,193619,193923,0,0,miked,,,"Good catch on my final point. Thanks.<p>>> ""The Nordic countries generally have better 'quality of life' than the US does, the US generally is stronger economically.""<p>Iceland certainly sounds nice, if you could tolerate the weather. ""Nordic countries"" is too general to be useful, I think. I'm a bit sceptical about making the quality of life comparisons, in any case. While traveling in Turkey about 7 years ago, a Swedish woman told me that a software developer there takes home about $1,300/month on average (i.e., after taxes). Restaurants in Sweden are so expensive that hardly anyone eats out. Six years ago (while the dollar was still strong) a large pizza in downtown Oslo went for $60. Even business executives pack a lunch.<p>Norway is doing fine economically, since it has a tiny population and is the world's third largest exporter of oil (though that's running out). Given the explosion in crime that Bawer mentions (at much greater length in his book _While Europe Slept_, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Cirlce Award), I think I'll find someplace else to hang. I've lived in Europe twice (Germany and Greece) and, while it had its points, it always felt sleepy to me.",1211196263

What harm can a For Loop do?<p>The best argument I heard against static typing, that for many tasks the type system forces you to write solutions that cater for the type system and forces you to create boilerplate code.<p>Isn't this ""no loop"" statement thing kind of the same, you have to reforumulate your solutions to cater for and use tail recusion, similarly to how you might have to reformulate your solutions to support a type system constraints<p>I prefer how OCaml allows you to program in different paradigms, in general thought OCaml does enforce many constraints, but its hybrid nature is a step in the right direction<p>I also like how Groovy (and Perl6) support optional typing.",1211195780

Sweden (ranking 6 on the 2007 index) has much of the same social structure as Iceland and Norway, but does not have the same availability of cheap energy. Sweden <i>does</i> have a fair amount of hydropower available, but you'll also find other countries in the top of the Human Development Index that do not have access to such luxuries.<p>Also, notice that the Middle East is nowhere near the top of the index. Having abundant natural resources certainly helps things along if a country has good leadership, but it is neither a necessary nor sufficient condition.",1211195493

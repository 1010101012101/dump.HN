I'm pretty sure at some point you'll be feeling some frustration.<p>Obviously I am speculating and it doesn't necessarily mean that's the case but to me, it sounds like they are doing this so that they can ""reward"" their employees. If it was me working for Twitter and was given a chance to cash in some of my employee stock, I would be a very happy and grateful employee.<p>If you look at it this way, then you can think they are doing this to retain some of their most loyal employees to continue working for them hence ""keeping them afloat"".",1311574386

Another great thing is that you can access the query engine inside the views, and the data associated to documents can be filled with whatever key values you want - so you can do advanced filtering/queries. The benefit is that you can extend the docpad server to do whatever you want (as it is just a node.js package) even add redirects and dynamic pages to the mix.

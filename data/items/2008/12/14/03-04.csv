397203,comment,396999,397029,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"You forgot about ""git commit"" vs. ""hg ci"".<p>The real reason is that git has Linus behind it, of course, and the fiasco with BitKeeper attracted a lot of attention. This led to tremendous buzz, and then the Ruby / Rails communities* (among others) started spreading and amplifying it. I see tons of blog posts about how git is <i>the best thing ever</i>, and it's a freaking <i>version control system</i>, you know? It's sort of like if people suddenly got singing-and-dancing-in-the-streets excited over a somewhat better version of make, or something. Think about that.<p>There are other DVCSs that are also quite good (I like Mercurial, for one), but a pretty good version control system can't compete with a pretty good version control system <i>with a tidal wave of hype</i>.<p>* Also, since the Rails people are themselves working on a popular web development system, they probably had a disproportionately large amount of influence among bloggers in tech circles.",1229226221

The only ""poor"" seemed to be in the outer paris suburbs (notable for violence in recent times) - and perhaps Calais, which was a bit of a toilet.<p>So I don't think its all like the Soviet comparison - in the soviet case it was deliberate mis-information to try and destabilise the west, controlled deliberately by soviet organisations.",1229225774
397201,comment,397173,397173,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, all those workers voted on whether this was a good contract.  I know I love reading 2,000 pages of legal crap.<p>Frankly, I think contracts this long are stupid.  Look at most of the legislation in DC.  It's so long that people can't (and don't) read it.  The 342 page USA PATRIOT Act passed in a day.  Sure, some people might be able to read 342 pages in a day, but I doubt any of them did.<p>I'm not against regulation or making clear what you're doing, but at a certain point it gets ridiculous.  People need to be able to understand the laws and contracts that govern them.",1229225770

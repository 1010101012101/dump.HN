Looking at sports, I suspect simply running 10 hours more every week than the competition won't automatically make you the winner. Rather, there is a system to getting the best effect from training (when to take breaks, what muscles to train when, what to eat, ...).<p>If you are stressing out with working harder and harder, perhaps you lose the time for having inspirations and seeing the important things to work on.",1254570840

858705,comment,858407,858558,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Because many of the researchers became obsessed with the new information that they were observing from Chimpanzees. In fact its often stated that Bonobos and Chimps are basically our Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.<p>In fact, despite been genetically further away from us, Orangutans are actually seen to be our closest relative in behaviour and by far in intelligence. Bornean Orangutans may actually live an existence similar to early hominids in that they travel far on the ground, however Sumatran Orangutans show more of our social instincts including tool use and group learning (they actually teach each other, opposed to the Chimp method of watching from a distance when new behaviours are exhibited).<p>The other reason for the radical changes is that Westerners had less access to the middle eastern countries to study the Asian primates (that like Orangutans can show us traits that were common before the divergence of the groups). Also the interest in Chimps is decreasing as they're increasingly being seen as predominantly over aggressive, which is actually an extremely uncommon trait amongst our close relatives (Orangutans and Gorillas are most dangerous to humans, not through aggression but through fear, where as Chimps are dangerous through direct aggression).<p>Orangutans are known for calculated reciprocity, a behaviour only exhibited in Humans and never exhibited in Chimps despite them being better studied and closer related. It shows an ability in Orangutans to track individual relationships in a group over long periods of time and to gauge how they should respond to individuals. Basically if you bought me a $30 gift, I'm not going to go out and spend $300 on you, and Orangutans do the same.<p>This leaves many questions like is it a second evolution of a similar behaviour, or did our common ancestor have this trait and the Pan and Gorilla genus both lose this ability. Either way it makes Orangutans a very important animal to study, because potentially they are our closest relative by means that they might be evolving along a similar path as humans.",1254570279

Both are wrong and them flaming out doesn't prove his point.<p>They flamed out because they weren't sticky with users, but it wasn't for lack of original coverage or eyeballs. IIRC, Cuil managed to get covered in pretty much every major news outlet, which converted into about 3M uniques on their first day! As I alluded to in the post (and better described in the posts I linked to), Google did their best to take the wind out of their sales with timely released and announced features (longer snippets, bigger index, in this case).<p>In retrospect, it seems that they were going to (at least initially) fail on their own, but Google didn't know that at the time.

858683,comment,857525,857735,0,0,m_eiman,,,"This makes me remember a passage I read in Nexus by Mark Buchanan (good book, read it!), where someone did an experiment to try to find the root of ""the rich get richer"". They construct a simulation of an economy, seed the participants in it with a random amount of money, and let it run for ""a long time"".<p>They end up with a distrubution of wealth that is very similar to what we see in the real world. The moral of the story: random chance will create the structure we're seeing in real life; being rich isn't proof that you're ""better"" than everyone else (supply your own definition of good), it's just as or more likely that you happened to be at the right place at the right time.",1254568985

858680,comment,858655,858655,0,0,miked,,,"My father-in-law was a mid-level Communist Party official (photo editor of the People's ""Liberation"" Army newspaper) who knew Mao personally. Years later Mao's people threw him in a concentration camp for ""rightists"" because he had made a joke about the Great Helmsman. When they ran out of cooking oil they would cook his food in used motor oil. The man they tortured and forced to rat him out never recovered from the shame. My wife and I had dinner with his daughter in Beijing two years ago. She still carries the shame for her father, even today. A little gift from Mao that keeps on giving.<p>They were the lucky ones, of course. The consensus estimate is that 70 million human beings have died so far during the CCP's reign of terror, mostly from starvation. My wife spent much of her youth hungry. She and her friends used to pull the stingers out of honeybees to get a bit of sweetness in their lives. The things little girls do, huh?<p>Not much terror these days of course, unless you're Tibetan, Falun Gong, or an enemy of the state. The strange thing for me, when walking around China, is that the monster's face is on the money. Statues of him are still common. He's the worst murderer who ever lived, and you have to look at him when buying a rose. Isn't life interesting?",1254568908

Now even people who previously could visit short-term either have to jump through hoops or have to apply for a visa. A significant amount more post-bush need visas than did pre-bush.<p>Because of decent negotiating on the British part, most Britons still apply for the visa-waving program (mostly because the British government said if the UK loses its Visa-waving program to the US, the US will lose its to the UK). This happened only a couple of years after the whole mandatory machine readable passport thing (which the British government again said that US citizens have to do it too).<p>Ironically the US was trying to ban British Pakistani's from entering the US, however the US never even attempted to prevent the entry of the IRA when they were purchasing weaponry from the US for terrorist purposes. I suppose the US's whole anti-terrorist stance is hugely different when they terrorists are helping your economy, not trying to destroy it.",1254568022

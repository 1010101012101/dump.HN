First, I'm a neuroscientist by training, so hearing anything related to ""upload my brain"" just makes me weep.  The only realistic way to ""upload your brain"" is to pump your body full of fixatives (paraformaldehyde), section it on a cryostat and then perform electron microscopy across every single slice.  Then put it all back together (fixing skewing artifacts, etc) on a computer.<p>THEN make a simulation out of it, where <i>every atom</i> of your body is replicated with pristine accuracy.  Otherwise you are not yourself anymore.<p>I'm not saying it's impossible.  I'm saying it's so far from likely that being near-immortal due to bio-enhancements is almost certainly more practical.  Or you can develop some ""scanning ray gun"" which does the same thing without killing you first, I suppose.<p>Second, the whole notion of ""exponentially increasing intelligence"" I find silly.  Are we more intelligent than homo sapiens 3000 years ago?  Perhaps more scholarly, more literate, more capable of engineering complex systems.  But our inherent, base intelligence is not any different.  Just applied to different problems and starting at different bases of knowledge.<p>Edit:  Musing on this, I find a ""Matrix""-style hostile takeover of highly intelligent AI much more likely than humans ""transcending"" into some super-computing cloud of blissful hyperintelligence.  That's seems much more likely than humans ever fully shucking our meat bag bodies.",1355341943

To me they were just a day like any other from a grander scheme. I'm just a tiny fraction different from yesterday. It's just a turn around the sun from an arbitrary point in space. So why bother?<p>But recently I realized the value they have. Humans need cycles and renovations. They need to get to a point where they can look back to what happened and what didn't in their lives and plan for the next cycle to make better. They need celebrations to allow them to relieve important moments and to realize that time is passing.<p>We celebrate not because the day itself has any special meaning, but because every one of us can get a special meaning out of it.<p>I was already coming to the realization, but the turning point was when a friend of mine told me her experiences working in countries close to the equator, where seasons and cycles don't exists. There, the culture is to live by the day, because winter never comes and they don't need to prepare for hard seasons. If they are hungry, fruits are always available, food is always provided by nature.<p>For this reason they don't plan ahead at work, they don't save money and they waste a lot of resources thinking that there will always be something provided to them.

It is helpful for addressing immediate concerns of the observable world. However, let's not pretend that its usefulness somehow makes it true. Predicting the FUTURE is difficult, so let's hedge our bets in case things start getting weird<p>The Thomist Philosopher Edward Feser often uses the metaphor of a metal dectector when discussing Methodological Naturalism. It runs roughly like... (paraphrased and typed quickly on IE6 [yes kill me])<p>""Science acts on the assumption of methodological naturalism and that's okay. It's like a metal detector that only detects metal but dectects it with great accuracy. What is wrong is that many times the method is made into a metaphysic which is philosophically hard to maintain and which simply does not follow from the facts.<p>That a metal dectector has never detected wood is obvious because the metal detector isn't for detecting word. The Baconian project ignored teleological forces because, per Bacon, such teleology is hard to analyze within a scientific framework. Science has therefore focused on Material and Efficent causation. However, just because a method effectly locates material and efficent causes doesn't mean that other causes don't exist just as a metal dectector not detecting wood does not mean that wood does not exist.

For some things, you can get there, for some others you can not do it.<p>So it leads to a different style of programming, you spend less time thinking about book-keeping, about making sure that you did not free the same buffer twice, ownership rules and so on, and you can focus more on the problem at hand.   In day-to-day life, you spend less time tracking down production bugs.<p>It is not a silver bullet, and wont fix every problem, and you still need to do careful bookkeeping of other things (like, did you load too many images?) but at least you can ignore the grueling minutiae and focus on what matters most.<p>It is a little bit like the difference between using raw OpenGL and loading your vertices manually every time or using a toolkit that loads meshes and textures for you.",1355341271

TL;DR version - scaling pixels makes them blocky, scaling vectors doesn't, for some small range of scaling we can keep upscaled pixels not blocky.<p>Upscaling has a lot of research behind it.

But when you blow it up 7x (like the example) it looks like a cartoon or a bad paint by numbers painting. The issue is that you lose information about the picture when you capture it, and without that information you have to 'make up' what you think would have been there had you been able to capture it. People get a lot of mileage out of the fact that for the most part real world imagery has a lot of linear transitions but there are limits to that as well.<p>I think the work is interesting but as they say in their paper: <i>""What we have shown already is that there is a viable continuous image format and that it can be used for some conventional operations which are not handled easily in
sampled formats.""</i> which I agree with, but the pixel is not yet in danger of extinction :-)",1355340974

Why? Because it'll be a member of a cohort of similar-looking articles most of which will be the CS equivalent of cold fusion research, and without citations, Wikipedians will have nothing to judge it by.<p>To me, it's a small miracle that Wikipedia works as well as it does, and that Wikipedia has more or less replaced ""real"" encyclopedias.

I mean if you have a server racked at Hetzner (or elsewhere) what is your ""plan b"" when there is a hardware failure.<p>In the case of a server that I just racked somewhere I will purchase a supply of the most logical parts to fail (fan, hard drive, board, power supply etc.) so that the parts are available and can be replaced quickly. I know that some providers take care of this for you so if the hardware fails (your hardware) you are back up and running quickly.<p>In the case of a VPS, by contrast, it can generally be assumed (nice if a way to verify this but I'm guessing there isn't) that they take have taken care of and planned for hardware issues and spares and have a strategy. Of course if they haven't you have a big problem. At least with your own hardware you can plan accordingly and insure a better outcome.<p>There are other issues as well. If the colo place is close to you do you keep the spare parts yourself or do you leave the spare parts with them?

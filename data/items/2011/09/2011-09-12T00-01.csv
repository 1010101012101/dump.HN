They also change every 6 weeks I believe.<p>So when Chrome 14 stable is out, Chrome 15 beta is out and also Chrome 16 Canary.

What if the contract with a customer was for 12 months, but 2 months in, right after staffing up, they just cancelled it and said ""fucking sue me""?  Kinda hard for the small startup to sue... and if they did, and they won, that win would be years after they had to let the employees go.)<p>You can't mitigate all risk, and being able to ignore the ones that you can't' do anything about is an important skill.<p>This goes for technical risk as well.

Centuries is not that long ago, and one can try to assume that remote indigenous populations are still similar. Lets assume we are talking thousands if not tens of thousands of years ago. There are a lot of things that scientists can try to interpret from skeletal and other bone remains, only some of them that would be a <i>direct</i> link to cancer.

If you follow that line of reasoning, than the frequency of degenerative issues in skeletal remains are likely related to the frequency of cancer and any other degenerative health issue. As one example, if you simply see caries (cavities) in the remains of the teeth, that would also mean cancer was more likely to occur. (very healthy indigenous cultures have almost no cavities). Obviously this is very loose logic, and certain groups are more likely to have certain issues that are more or less likely to show up in skeletal remains, but I believe the general principle is sound.",1315788229

It's funny how you prefer modern software, yet you don't make use of a spellchecker, something which, to my knowledge, was not available on OS/360, but which is easily available today. Spellcheckers are the non-native speaker's best friend. I know that they may not catch certain things, like the difference between ""their"" and ""there"", but they would prevent most of your simple mistakes. You can make use of today's software to appear more professional, instead of just talking about how much better it is than the 1960's technologies that I prefer.<p>You should tell IBM, what I said, because their compiler upgrades and certification programs are not just for people with old code. PL/I is being used for new code, mostly by companies who are not persuaded by the shininess of the latest fads. PL/S, a proprietary dialect of PL/I, was used internally, by IBM, to create much of z/OS. XPL, another dialect of PL/I, was used to create the compiler for HAL/S, the language in which the programs that controlled the Space Shuttle were written. Incidentally, I note that HAL/S supported GOTO, which is amazing, considering that mission-critical aerospace applications could use GOTO, when written in a good language, whereas Javascript and its modern, GOTO-less brethren, regardless of speed, are not, as far as I know, worthy of such important applications.<p>I submit that there are no languages intrinsically ""better"" than PL/I, or, at least, that there isn't much else, that's been created since 1970, which is better than the latest PL/I (which is likely to be IBM's Enterprise PL/I for z/OS). Pretty much anything important, that you can code, in one of today's hip languages, I can also code, in my ancient PL/I ""F"" compiler, on OS/360, and those things which I can't do there, I probably could, by upgrading to MVS, under S/370, again on Hercules, where I can use the PL/I ""Optimizing"" compiler, but even that additional capability still puts me in the 1970's.<p>My original, fundamental point, which is correct, and which you cannot successfully argue against, is: Since the end of the OS/360 era, there has been a definite trend towards a tremendous waste of resources in rediscovering old programming truths, with some of the worst waste being in permanently forgetting about some very cool advances which we thus have to do without, today. A great deal of expensive, expert domain knowledge has been lost in old, abandoned codebases, and usually for no more reason than merely a glimmer of hope that some new way of doing things will be ""better"". One small example is Multics, an amazing operating system, written mostly in EPL, yet another dialect of PL/I.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multics</a>",1315786480

Just case by case basis and for less than the Apple Store or a new phone. Mostly just word of mouth stuff started by fixing a few for friends and family.<p>It's just been a side business but I want to expand - more aggressive about finding clients, maybe train a few other people over the next few months.<p>Usually someone tells me their phone is broken I'll grab a kit from iFixit, but that isn't the best price to start buying in bulk. A lot of the places saying they sell bulk just look really sketchy. Does anyone have advice for a small timer on finding wholesale vendors of iPhone (and hopefully iPad as that market grows) parts?",1315786448
2985287,comment,2983884,2985156,3,0,m-photonic,,,">It is occasionally possible, with a sample of genetic information about genes not under strong selection pressure, to make a reasonably accurate rough guess of the ""race"" categorization of many individuals. (I have read the article, and I see that that is the claim, as in the excerpt you quote, but the article also notes exceptions in the sample it examined who were miscategorized.) But those study authors, and all competent human geneticists, do NOT argue the converse: that if you know an individual's race categorization, you know to a reasonable degree of accuracy what specific genes that person has of interest to human behaviors.<p>I don't think the comment you're replying to purported to argue that in the first place. He was just trying to refute the notion that race is merely a matter of social labels; the fact is those labels refer to something real in terms of a person's ancestry that can be detected by genetic tests.<p>Like you say, it has never been demonstrated that racial groups differ in their genetic propensity for intelligence, but it has also never been demonstrated that they don't. Given the observed IQ differences between racial groups and the fact that these groups differ genetically, a genetic basis for these differences seems like a reasonable thing to hypothesize about, and apply scientific methods of inquiry into. This is why I have a problem with a statement like ""race and IQ is not a legitimate matter for scientific inquiry.""",1315786410

Graham wrote: ""Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.""<p>Friedman has something of a grasp of that part, but he's a tremendous cretin, and doesn't get the very important point that acquiring wealth fast by the deeply problematic routes above, is far easier than <i>making</i> wealth.  The ability to <i>make</i> wealth is problematic to people who currently hold a tremendous amount of concentrated wealth, and they are trying to stamp it out. They're humans in the grip of a cognitive bias, unable (modulo a few folks like Warren Buffett and George Soros) to comprehend that more real wealth benefits everyone. They've also generally abandoned real wealth and gone into ephemeral financial instruments, with a retrograde result - we're on our way back to the disastrous situation where you can safely assume that anyone with wealth acquired it by immoral means.<p>Since I come from this point of view, I find that the critiques of Friedman also slightly miss the point - you're going to need to destroy a lot of what we currently think of as 'wealth' if you want anything remotely resembling social justice, and naturally the people who hold that false wealth will resist this.  I am fine with that because I believe we're back to the point where there's a de facto inherited aristocracy and that the old problems of wealth and power have not at all gone away no matter how much we enjoy the symbols and pageant of representational democracy.",1315785928

Such an infrastructure could make it practical to start from a clean slate especially if it could allow us to unravel and discard much of the tangle of complexities that make web programing so much different from native programming.  We need to focus on how we use the internet and what we need from it and then revise the current web achitecture to see what's really needed, what's fluff, and what just plain idiocy.   Right now, I think we'd find too much fluff and idiocy and not much of what's really needed.  This could pave the way for a simplified and more unified architecture that could do what we want and could make it easier to deliver applications across the web.  Simplifying that delivery would make it possible to simplify web programming, making it more intuitive and less burdened by security considerations.  An altogether different infrastructure would spark new innovations in programming (as others in HN have posted that such innovation has stalled).",1315785829

What do you mean by ""possible""?<p>You almost certainly mean choosing a lower bitrate whose numerical perceptual quality is similar to the video encoded at a higher bitrate. Of course, x264 can do thatthat's what the CRF value is. It already has technology to choose the best bitrate per GOP given its perceptual model.<p>Even if I take everything you say at face value, your semantics, at minimum, are the snake oil. You make it sound like this perceptual compression technology doesn't exist, when it actually ships on by default in Handbrake.<p>I think what Daiz is talking about is snake oil of the technology, not semantic, variety.<p>So let's talk technology snake oil. Your special perceptual model might find situations where it could reduce the bitrate in a way that x264's model would disagree. But what about situations where x264's model is better? The end-user never gets to see where x264 makes a subjectively better image than your system does at a lower bitrate.<p>In other words, quality arbitrage: you can always claim to reduce bitrate by adjusting your model to be a bit more permissive than the competition. Knowing there is no rigorous numerical way to compare two perception-optimizing compressors, you can get away with ""arbitrage"" bitrate reductions.<p>Put another way, a lot of people are going to demand the wrong tests, because they don't understand the inherent contradiction of comparing two perception-optimizing compressors (like allegedly Beamr and x264's CRF model).<p>The way I'd know if your perceptual model were in fact better is if you could show me situations where it is wrong. In other words, convert your ""lowest... possible"" Beamr Perceptual Model parameter to a CRF parameter. You could do it subjectively. Find me situations where x264 chooses a lower bitrate than your model. At least if your model is falsifiable, it isn't snake oil.<p>Incidentally, Diaz did exactly this test. And your model calculate a worse bitrate than an equivalently-chosen CRF in all cases.<p>So your model isn't snake oilit's just bad. Perhaps we would randomize the subjective differences, but my suspicion is the default Handbrake CRF (20.0) will work better more than 50% of the time for randomized videos against a randomized audience.",1361930195

If Beamr is recompressing something to a lower quality at a given bitrate compared to standard techniques, this implies that you haven't actually solved the problem of finding the optimum settings. If the tool doesn't support this, it would probably be best to turn off the constant bitrate feature until it does support it well.

The technologies we have developed, JPEGmini and Beamr Video, are definitely not ""Snake Oil"", and I don't think it would be good practice to make such claims regarding any company's technology without checking the facts first and asking for the company's response before posting.<p>Our technologies for image and video compression have received excellent reviews in the media, and have been tested and proven by industry experts.  You can find the reviews online, and I would be happy to send you the quotes we got from the industry experts as well.  Thousands of users are using our free online photo optimization service at JPEGmini.com daily, and thousands more have purchased JPEGmini for Mac to optimize images locally, and they are all very happy with these tools.<p>The important thing regarding our technologies, and the main point you have missed in your analysis, is that they are used for automatic image optimization to the lowest bitrate or file size possible, and not for encoding an image or video to a specific bitrate or file size.  Based on analysis of the image or video using a perceptual quality measure we have developed, we adaptively set the encoding parameters for each image or video.  So the amount of compression for each image or video clip is different, and depends on the content and original quality of that image.<p>Comparing the quality of a clip encoded in Beamr Video with the quality of the same clip encoded at the same bitrate using another encoder is meaningless, since part of the uniqueness of Beamr Video is ""knowing"" what is the right bitrate (actually the lowest bitrate possible) for encoding each video such that it stays perceptually identical to the original clip.  Beamr Video is the only technology that can adaptively reduce the bitrate of any clip to the minimum amount possible, while ensuring that quality of the output clip is perceptually identical to the quality of the input clip.<p>The same is true for our image technology: We reduce each JPEG file to the minimum file size possible without affecting its original quality.  Of course, you can take a specific file and tune a regular JPEG encoder to reach the same size on that specific file. And you can also manually tune the quality for each image using a regular JPEG encoder by viewing the photo before and after compression.  But there is no other technology that can take millions of photos and automatically adapt the size of each one to the minimum possible size while preserving quality.<p>The clips on our website are an initial demo of Beamr Video we are offering today, based on Blu-Ray sources.  In a few weeks we will launch a cloud-based Beamr Video encoding service, where everyone will be able to process their own clips and reach their own conclusions.  There are free trial versions of JPEGmini available for anyone to download and try. So again, I don't understand the basis of your ""Snake Oil"" claim.  I would be happy to continue this discussion with you privately if you like, you can email me at dror@beamr.com.",1361929228

Fortunately the doctor who diagnosed her after a couple of days was young and up to speed, realizing even the hospital food was exacerbating her condition.  Simply changing her diet while in hospital and she felt remarkably better after just a couple of days.  One physician she saw later in life even dismissed the idea that such a condition existed, even with the GI evidence presented.  There's a growing recognition of the condition, and as stated elsewhere it's not actually that hard to eat gluten free if you prepare your own food, and today there are more restaurants that will cater to it, though one always runs the risk of contamination when eating out (about 1 out of 10 I'd say based on experience, but we eat out infrequently anyway).  Like anything that becomes a fad though there are people who will dismiss the idea of an intolerance - I once watched a waitress bring back a salad she'd obviously simply removed the croutons from after being asked, again, for a crouton-free salad (a particularly ugly piece of radicchio gave it away).  After I pitched a fit, we left, being unable to trust the attention of the staff.  Many celiacs develop other food sensitivities - once the cilia is damaged, the body seems more susceptible to future problems.<p>As for those who think their symptoms being mild means it's not gluten intolerance, the gold standard remains an upper GI examination - it's not that bad (I've had several, for other reasons), and then you know and can react with knowledge vice guessing (there's a blood test not yet approved as I recall).  While feeling good again was quick for my wife, it took several weeks to actually consider her healthy again - she had been malnourished for some time prior to the diagnosis, and any such stressful event will take time to recover from.",1361928783

It would would take time just to figure out what the key niches are where they could be useful (do folks need/want crop price data? weather info? news? wikipedia? Oscars coverage? something else?), what technical work has to be done to get there (connectivity, software, content, and maybe different kinds of devices, e.g., maybe the ideal device for some folks is e-ink-based and low-power like a Nook/Kindle), and all kinds of distribution/operations stuff.<p>And it could be a great business: being the first folks to get things right for this huge group of people is going to be a big deal as that chunk of the world moves up the development/economic ladder, one hopes.<p>I can't, personally, do very much of that in 5 years but had I capital and all-purpose moxie, there's the problem space I'd love to tackle.<p>I think there are big things to do in genomics, GWAS, medical data, etc. I don't really know what they are.

Which also includes virtual machine environments that emulate PCs. Apple could lock <i>Mac hardware</i> down, yes, but they can't stop a Hackintosh from running whatever it likes--because you wouldn't build a TPM chip into your Hackintosh.<p>Now, if your argument is that Apple is going to take OSX and make it into something that <i>doesn't</i> run on generic PCs, but rather a specific, closed environment that loosely resembles PCs [thus killing all ability to do Hackintosh builds, run OSX in a VM, etc.], I agree that there's a <i>very slight</i> possibility of that.<p>But Apple has a <i>heavy incentive</i> to keep OSX running on generic PCs. For one thing, it's required to maintain backward compatibility with all the current hardware that <i>are</i> just generic PCs. For another, it gives them the ability to test their software using generic VM products, rather than a specialized ""simulator."" For a third, it allows them to just construct a new prototype Mac in the lab out of the newest off-the-shelf components (picture an empty Mac Pro case with random hardware inside), and then use it to write and test drivers for those components, instead of waiting for a specialized mobo to be produced for them that supports all those technologies <i>and</i> carries their special, needed OSX TPM chip.<p>Sure, Apple <i>could</i> push the industry to standardize a UDID-carrying TPM chip for all devices (this is basically the dystopia everyone was scared would happen with Palladium), so that Apple could use off-the-shelf hardware and still do device-key deploys to it.<p>And sure, Apple <i>could</i> write their own machine simulator.<p>And sure, Apple <i>could</i> just make the device-deploy-keys feature optional until an OSX release where all the old hardware is no longer supported.<p>But why? What advantage does this give them? It sounds like a lot of hassle to create a world where it's harder for everyone--including Apple's own in-house developers--to develop, test, and distribute Mac software. A world where fewer developers want to develop for OSX. A world where it's impossible for enterprises (yes, Apple has enterprise customers) to deploy their own internal software over their networks.<p>Now, look out below, for :itisacaranalogy: --<p>If you're a car company who makes <i>sedans</i> [iOS devices] for ""consumer driving"", and <i>trucks</i> [Macs] for ""utility driving"", what purpose would it serve to turn all your products into cars? Especially if your own employees require a truck, as part of their job, to haul loads around the workplace?<p>As far as I can see, Macs are going to <i>diverge</i> from iOS, not <i>converge</i>. The more consumers who buy sedans [instead of buying a truck they don't need and then complaining when it doesn't have heated seats], the more ""trucky"" the trucks can become without impacting sales. Macbook Pros and Mac Minis--both ""trucks""--are here to stay.<p>On the other hand, iMacs and Macbook Airs--both ""sedans""--might just get locked down, run iOS, and probably have touchscreens one day. But that's just fine, isn't it?<p>The MBP looks like it's going to keep getting lighter until there's no need for a separate ""Air"" category any more; if they keep the brand after that, it'll be for an iOS device with a keyboard attached.<p>And the iMac is already a redundant competitor to (Mac Mini + Cinema Display); so it will probably make more sense as a big iOS touchscreen ""kiosk."" Instead of having a Mac built in, it'll have an Apple TV built in. (I imagine the Cinema Display would also get touchscreen capabilities, and then you'd get the same experience as an iMac by hooking an external Apple TV up to it instead of a Mac Mini.)<p>---<p>...and note that everything I just said could apply equally well to Microsoft. They have all the same choices available to them, and there's already the same ""nervousness"" surrounding the Surface RT.

The term ""opinionated design"" is basically an excuse to make a rigid, unadaptable behemoth, because it's easier to just say ""if you don't like it, you don't have to use it"" than to address some of the problems. There is a balance, of course, and you can't spend all your time abstracting out to support the most transformative, irregular use case, but something like mixing ORMs or templating languages is actually a great example. Look at Pyramid v. Django/the others. A web framework should simply be about piping your program's I/O to the web. Templating and ORM shouldn't even be in scope. Having reasonable defaults is fine, but claiming it's OK to tightly couple your general-use web framework with user-facing unrelated libraries as hard dependencies (i.e., forcing users to use a certain ORM/templater) because it's ""opinionated design"" is silly. It's simply bad design.",1361927478

If you can cite precedent that disagrees with my second sentence, I'd be very interested to read it.<p>How about the DMCA prohibition on circumvention of DRM in light of the process set out in 17 U.S.C. 1201(a)(1)(C) regarding the Librarian of Congress exempting DMCA circumvention from criminal liability in specific circumstances. The very existence of the latter admits a violation of your second sentence, because if the law did not prohibit such things in the general case then there could never be anything to request an exemption for. And the possibility of an exemption being granted doesn't disprove the point because any act falling into your category when the ""code"" is DRM remains prohibited unless an explicit exemption is both applied for and granted, and then renewed every three years. The exemption for jailbreaking phones that recently expired provides a concrete example of that not happening.<p>>All law is fuzzy because human concepts of morality and right and wrong are fuzzy. That is why we rely on human judges and juries to interpret them.<p>This is a popular refrain used in response to engineering types who naively expect the law to be so fully specified that it can be subject to mathematical analysis or proved to be internally consistent, etc. And it's true that for pragmatic and practical reasons we can't have laws that are perfectly clear and utterly unambiguous.

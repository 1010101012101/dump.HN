775822,story,,,9,14,aik,"Ask HN:  Would you consider an online education?",,"There has been so much talk lately about online education.  I'm wondering what the hacker crowd thinks here.<p>If you could redo your education in today's world, would you spend a ridiculous amount of time and money on a formal college education, or do you think you could mostly self-teach yourself using mostly the web?  Would you allow (or prefer) your children to educate themselves online before/after high school?<p>Second question:  Is anyone here working on an online education technology?  Website?",1250794671

I'm not an expert on many of the things listed, but many stick out as just not making any sense:<p>First of all, holy special pleading batman! Pretty much right at the beginning he redefines health care to exclude things he admits work - diet, exercise, sleep, not smoking, etc. Who does he think figured out that smoking was bad? Or how much exercise and sleep is enough, and how much is too much? Or what foods are good for you and which are bad?<p>He also claims that there are ""dozens of studies of the aggregate health effects of medicine"", but most of the studies he describes are very specific - several only studying the last six months of people's lives, ignoring how many cases of people living extra <i>years</i> because of medicine? He also admits that increased social status improves health while claiming that increased medical spending does not. But it's well known that the rich can afford better health care, and doesn't explain how to (or cite any papers that) control for this.<p>Lastly, he only considers length of life and totally ignores <i>quality of life</i>. I take an antidepressant for my anxiety, and while it probably will not affect the length of my life, it sure as hell is worth every penny in improving the <i>quality</i> of my life!",1250794607

Whether or not something can be universally achieved is orthogonal to the question.<p>I don't doubt that we have a society that says rich is awesome, poor is terrible, but here's the thing: when we say that ""society says foo"", what we mean is that a large percentage of individuals are saying foo.  Lots of individuals say ""rich is awesome, poor is terrible"" because they actually believe that they prefer the one to the other, not because some external ""society"" (I place it in scare quotes because any society does not have an existence independent from individuals) forces or tricks or brainwashes them into it.",1250794309

Usually, they are fixed and included in a later edition of the journal as ""Errata to [name of paper]."" The main purpose of the refereeing process is to detect game-breaking errors such as a missed condition on a theorem used or a misapplication of a tricky technique (usually from another field of mathematics).

One thing that  makes our system unfair is the failure to communicate what happens, not just how the system actually works.  (You must spend lot's of time and money to find all the available tax breaks.)<p>With my version of “fair” you should rework the federal tax code to be as simple as possible.  Everyone get’s 700$ / month from the government, free health care and pays ~35% in taxes with zero tax breaks of any kind and no minimum wage of any kind.  Donate to charity or retirement and you get no help from the government.  You are still protected from starvation, but there is no unemployment insurance, social security or medicare.<p>The real advantage is the simple system is easy to understand and does what most “social” programs (SS, Medicare, Medicaid etc) try and do.  There are also just 2 numbers to debate, the tax rate and the government subsidy.<p>PS: A true tax code would need to be longer than that, but the goal would be something that could be printed legibly on a single sheet of paper and understood by most people with an 8th grade education.",1250792790

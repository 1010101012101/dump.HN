In 2) there is generally a shortage of people relative to the available jobs.<p>Applying the professional sports metaphor to category 2 merely demonstrates that as a manager you are a f---t--d, which is probably why they have ridiculously bad turnover (a HQ location that might as well be in Siberia being another).",1440838754

For any given task the two are equivalent, except that one is easily modified/reused/passed to other callers without creating an extremely brittle class hierarchy you&#x27;re only going to have to rearchitect when your requirements change. As an IBM researcher looking at Watson waaaay before Watson actually existed: &quot;OOP requires you to treat <i>all</i> extrinsic information as if it were intrinsic to the object itself.&quot; This is tantamount to saying you must have a complete and consistent programme design before you write a single line.

10139442,comment,10138916,10138916,0,0,zmmmmm,,,"There were three really shocking things about this. Firstly, how little any of the politicians who voted for it understood what it was. Virtually none of them could even define what &quot;meta data&quot; meant, yet were casting judgement on the privacy implications of retaining it.<p>Secondly, how poorly drafted the actual legislation ended up being. Since nobody involved understood it, the law itself is a series of self contradictory statements that make very little sense. At some point they decided to exclude &quot;web browsing history&quot; but nobody obviously knew how on earth to write that in, so it became its own section that overrode the other sections to say that &quot;nothing else in this bill requires retention of anything that could be interpreted to be web browsing history&quot; - despite the fact that the rest of the bill very explicitly details retention of web browsing history. As it stands, the law is unimplementable, and thus what is now happening is that ISPs are going through a process of getting &quot;guidance&quot; which is a euphemism for &quot;since we can&#x27;t legally operate any more given this law is unimplementable, just tell us what you want and we will do it&quot;.<p>Finally, the fact that there was a sudden and inexplicable spike in terrorism raids in the weeks when the bills were debated. There have been almost no raids since, and there were almost no raids before. Yet in those critical weeks, law enforcement just happened to decide that it was timely to execute a bunch of &quot;raids&quot;, which have had no material outcome. In other words, law enforcement appears to be transparently corrupt and willing to abuse its powers for political ends.

So I can&#x27;t recommend a link to you, instead I&#x27;ll try to explain them in my own words.<p>Affine types are those whose values can only be used <i>at most once</i>. They are implemented in Rust as ownership and borrowing. In my example above, `send_header` borrows the `conn` variable, whereas `send_body` takes the ownership of the `conn` variable. As you lost the ownership of `conn`, you cannot use it anymore, thus resulting in a compile error.<p>This is similar to C++&#x27;s move semantics, where you are not permitted to move the same value more than once. It is just that in C++ &quot;move only once&quot; is a convention, whereas in Rust it is enforced by the type system.<p>In Rust, if you pass an argument by value, you&#x27;re automatically using affine types. You cannot use the passed variable anymore. To &quot;borrow&quot; instead, you need to opt-out using references. So, the hypothetical API I mentioned above would be written as:<p><pre><code>  fn send_header(&self, text: &str) { ... }\n  fn send_body(self, text: &str) { ... }\n</code></pre>\nNote the difference of `&`.<p>Finally, all of these aren&#x27;t just hypothetical. The exactly same design is used in Hyper[1], which is an HTTP library, and in nickel[2], which is a web framework in Rust. If you look at the API doc you will see there is no &#x27;&&#x27; in the self parameter. That means it&#x27;s passed by value, using affine types, and the ownership is transferred, so you cannot use the original variable anymore.<p>I hope this helps.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hyper.rs/hyper/hyper/client/struct.RequestBuilder.html#method.send"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyper.rs/hyper/hyper/client/struct.RequestBuilder.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://docs.nickel.rs/nickel/struct.Response.html#method.send"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.nickel.rs/nickel/struct.Response.html#method.sen...</a>",1440836772

The implementation-defined value of CHAR_BIT is at least 8 (page 21). There are some implementations [1] that chose other values like 16 or 32. So while sizeof(char) is always 1 byte it&#x27;s not necessarily always 1 octet.<p>[1] <a href=""http://bytes.com/topic/c/answers/223565-implementations-char_bit-32-a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bytes.com/topic/c/answers/223565-implementations-char...</a>",1440835903

But people seem to be willing to pay the price if that means they at least get a device that just works (tm), at least most of the time.<p>At work, we recently got a couple of wifi routers and installed DD-WRT on them to finally get a decent wireless network that spans the entire building, plus a guest network that is isolated from the company network. The freedom and flexibility DD-WRT offers made this both easy and - relatively - enjoyable.<p>(I do not own a Fritz!Box, and I never have. The last piece of equipment made by AVM I owned was a Fritz!Card ISDN card which sat in an ISA slot, so you can roughly figure out how long ago that must have been...)",1440835432

It gives you as an employee the chance to make a pretty good living and more importantly sharpen your skills so that when you&#x27;re finished there it&#x27;s easy to move on. And if then you want to have a nice stable job which you can expect to stay in for the next decade, you can.<p>Investment banking and high-end consulting have worked on a simpler principle for a long time. When you&#x27;re young you work crazy hours and get really at your job. Once you&#x27;re no longer able to do that, you leave for a calmer environment.",1440835386

After hearing the story about laying off the tech team to move to AWS...well, let&#x27;s just say that the salaries I&#x27;ve heard wouldn&#x27;t be enough. They recruit engineers like crazy, but they still couldn&#x27;t find a use for their existing, high-performing team? That seems insane.<p>The whole time I was listening to this, I was thinking: if a company is going to treat me like a <i>de facto</i> contractor, shouldn&#x27;t I just ask for the (much higher) hourly risk-adjusted rate I&#x27;d demand as a contractor? Why bother with the charade of full-time employment at all?",1440835381
10139405,comment,10139023,10139023,0,0,codeonfire,,,"One thing where the Netflix system breaks down is for some reason managers are never found to be useless or relevant.  It becomes a small number of individual contributors trying to support a larger and larger management base.  The real reason is political.  The people at the top fear people rising through the ranks so they execute people like a dictatorship.  At my previous job everyone with more than 15 years of experience was pushed out and people with no experience at all were brought in.  Now, no one can make the case that people with no experience were not useless.  They had no skills.  If it were a pro sports team, it would be like bringing in little league players.  The idea is the little league-ers are so excited about being in the big leagues they don&#x27;t complain about the inept coaches.<p>It makes perfect political sense to have high turnover.  What managers will typically do is turn over the workforce, but also scale down the thing they are trying to accomplish to meet the capabilities of their little league-ers.  All they want is to be able to claim a &#x27;success&#x27; so they can get promoted.  They cut the workforce down, cut the work down, but when they build the n-millionth + 1 music service or chat app they claim it is a revolution.  Executive management says, &quot;wow you created a music service, here have $500k&quot; and the process starts again.  No one has the cojones to point out that the company has inadvertently started to play little league because the executives are trying to ride successes as well.",1440835306

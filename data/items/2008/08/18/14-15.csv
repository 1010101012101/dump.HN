It's conceptually simple for a human being to imagine, but you'd need very accurate real-time location information on the device and the head of the onlooking user.  I don't think this is feasible right now.<p>But what functionality would you get out of it that you couldn't get with an iPhone real-time video overlay with a set of cross hairs as a cursor?  Isn't there a demo already where a couple of Scandinavian guys implemented this?  You'd get the same functionality within the limits of the current infrastructure and technology.",1219071384

279254,comment,279031,279237,0,0,ratsbane,,,"Validating the account on the server is a problem but that doesn't affect the usefulness of validating the hostname itself as something which can accept mail.  E.g.: I just queried a database of about 40k email addresses in a production system for ""hotmal.com"" and found two.  ""Hotmal.com"" isn't running anything on port 25 so it's likely that these people meant to enter ""hotmail.com.""  I'm sure if we filtered this entire pool of addresses for misspellings we'd find a lot more. We could get something approaching 100% accuracy if we required users to receive an email and click on a link to verify; perhaps that's not a bad idea, but that often takes the user off of the page where he or she entered the address and breaks the process and we'd probably lose a few people.  We're not going to get massive improvements in the process because it's already pretty good but even a small improvement is worth something.<p>Also I realize that if an email account is running on a server in someone's kitchen it may be down at one moment but still able to receive emails so I'm thinking more of an ajax call from the entry page to a validation routine which would check for obvious things - the hostname doesn't exist, isn't running, isn't running a mail server, is similar to known misspellings... and then alerts the user inline that there MAY be a problem... but still allows the user to proceed with the address entered.",1219070284

It used to be that you could even ask for a list of valid emails for a server.<p>You want to validate an email address, send an actual email to it and see if anyone who cares answers it. Don't even expect much of an error if you try to send an email to a bad address, a lot of servers will just send them in /dev/null directly.",1219068627

It seems to me that the average opinion here is in favour of most posts being about technical/startup topics, but that it's good to have a few interesting posts that fall outside that category - provided they don't overwhelm the 'normal' content of the site.<p>In that case, then, the comments saying ""This is off-topic"" - and the degree to which they are voted up - provide a barometer: They indicate to what extent people feel that the 'off-topic' posts are: a) Low in quality, b) drowning out 'normal' tech/startup content. This, in turn, provides social pressure to reduce the number (and increase the quality) of 'off-topic' submissions.<p>(Of course, you then hit a form of Giles's paradox of social news sites: the people most likely to submit to this social pressure may be the ones with the most interesting 'off-topic' links to share)",1219068538

The money involved is less than a year's tuition in many US colleges, and the recipients are mostly young enough to just live with their parents for a few months, and not need it anyway. The funding is minor, but the other parts - startups <i>pay</i>, a lot, to get this level of publicity and consulting.<p>I'd go with the ""record label"" metaphor instead of Lacy's American Idol one (I'm older ;)): Find talent, give them some producer and studio hours to record a single, then use your connections with DJs to get it some airplay hope it will catch on. Watch ""24 Hour Party People"" for more details :)<p>The one piece missing here, though, is the fact that ultimately the public (pre-mp3) was paying money for the singles. YC's audience is big companies with money to spend - it may prove less sustainable in the long run.",1219068447

IIRC, you have to strip comments and normalize whitespace before you use this.

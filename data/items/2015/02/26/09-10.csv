9111796,comment,9109801,9109801,0,0,stdbrouw,,,"Banning p-values makes sense to me, as they force you to declare an effect as either significant or not significant, rather than looking at the preponderance of the evidence and building knowledge over multiple experiments. It also leads us to focus on statistical uncertainty at the expense of all of the other kinds of uncertainty researchers are faced with: do I have the theory to back this up, am I actually measuring what I am trying to measure, is this coherent with other findings in the field? I do think the editors might be right when they say banning p-values will make the quality of the research go up, not down.<p>But if you read the original editorial, up at <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01973533.2015.1012991"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01973533.2015.101...</a>, you can see that they also reject confidence intervals and Bayesian reasoning with uniform priors (which is really the same thing) without providing any guidance at all on better procedures. I fear that will just lead readers to try and guess the reliability of the data themselves, or worse, interpret the sample statistics as numbers without any associated uncertainty.<p>So they&#x27;re doing away with poor statistical procedures, but at what cost?

The biggest problem here is that typically it takes a visionary to recognize a visionary in the early stages, before any of the vision has actually been realized. And that&#x27;s only part of the equation, there&#x27;s also talent, ability to execute well, and luck of course.<p>If you&#x27;re a time traveler from the future, sure you bet on Bill and Paul, because you know how that turns out. But let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re a time traveler from an alternate timeline, or an alien from a more advanced planet, can you still tell who to bet on? Even if you had the knowledge to know how people would use computers in the future and what sorts of things would be most in demand, Microsoft wasn&#x27;t necessarily the best bet way back in the Altair Basic era. Back then the obvious choice would have been Gary Kildall and Digital Research who had CP/M, a serious operating system that was light years ahead of the competition in the late &#x27;70s. It took several bizarre twists and turns for Microsoft to end up on top, but it was far from foreordained that they would. Other obvious competitors included Lotus and VisiCalc, folks who seemed poised to have strong offerings nestled in the bosom of a growing computer industry.<p>What Microsoft had that the others lacked was sticktoitiveness, adaptability, and business savvy. They were willing to do what ever it took to ride to the top, whereas other companies were satisfied with &quot;merely&quot; massive runaway success. And that showed up in surprising and non-intuitive ways. DR built CP/M from the ground up and invested heavily in making it the best they could. Microsoft bought a clone of CP/M that was written in 6 weeks for $75k because they needed an OS to deliver to IBM for the IBM PC, and they thought that was a reasonable business arrangement to be in. In no way does that sound like sound engineering or sound business strategy, but it turned out to be one of the most pivotal events in computing history. It was Microsoft&#x27;s tenacity and their desire to make billions where others were content to make only billions that brought them to the top of the industry, things that weren&#x27;t really obvious until after they happened.<p>For venture capitalists this problem isn&#x27;t a big deal, because they can just play the lottery and invest in Digital Research as well as Microsoft and Lotus and all the reasonable bets. For people looking for &quot;the next microsoft&quot; to work at, the problem is much more difficult, if not fundamentally impossible.",1424943542

Try dating outside of an app. It&#x27;s pretty amazing the social changes that I believe are a result of being able to date almost exclusively through an app. Friends of mine mention that people don&#x27;t ask people out in person anymore. One friend came back from France and was amazed to have people ask her out in person. She said it felt almost shocking and archaic. So, yes, computers are changing our social character, and likely our personal character as a result of their increasing presence in our lives.",1424941847

If out of every 100 random samples, in 95 of them the parameter is in the interval, then surely the probability of the parameter being in the interval is 95% by definition?&quot; is flawed because <i>we are not talking about the same interval every time</i>, right?<p>If I have a variable that is always positive, then I could have a weird procedure to generate confidence intervals that gives me the interval [-inf,0] 5% of the time and the interval [0,inf] 95% of the time.<p>This would meet the definition of confidence intervals perfectly, and yet when I get [-inf,0] the real probability of the parameter being in the interval is 0%, and when I get [0,inf], it&#x27;s 100%.<p>I wonder how large this discrepancy may be in practice (as this is obviously a made-up extreme case).",1424941696

The funny things was I think what tipped MS off about my problem was that I was able to send e-mail though my smtp server on my domain to hotmail inboxes if and only if i used OUTLOOK from MS. The only difference was the e-mail headers!!<p>When I used outlook. 100% perfect. If I sent e-mail via thunderbird OR a php script my mail would never even reach the junk mail!! It would just black hole.<p>I compared the headers from outlook and thunderbird and my php script and the body was identical. Only the outlook e-mail had extra header information that MS refuses to identify or explain.",1198418226

And also publish an SPF record on your domain. (TXT record)<p>If this dosen't work you need to fill out a form here:<p><a href=""https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl&ct=eformts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.msn.com/eform.aspx?productKey=edfsmsbl&c...</a><p>Microsoft will e-mail you back with a generic response. If they haven't helped you, you need to reply to this e-mail with more information about your problem. It might take a few e-mails back and forth with them but eventually I received this:<p>""I am pleased to inform you that we have taken steps to implement a temporary mitigation to your mail delivery problem.  The mitigation will take 24-48 hours to fully reflect in our system.""<p>""During the mitigation period  your emails should not experience any issues arriving in Hotmail customer's inboxes.  This period will also give our filters sufficient time to learn enough about your mailing practices that after the mitigation expires your mails shouldn't any issues with arriving in our Hotmail customer's inboxes.""<p>
So Microsofts spam filters basicly mess up and block all you e-mails. This is a microsoft issue and they need to fix their ""SmartScreen"" technology.<p>This worked for me and now I can send e-mail from my domain directly into the inboxes of hotmail users.<p>This is a BIG problem with hotmail and their spam technology and caused me a week long headache. I hope you have better results.",1198418012

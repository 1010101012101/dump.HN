4919672,comment,4918720,4918720,8,0,dizzystar,,,"This is a bittersweet day for me. I have two sites running on Clojure + Noir. I just moved my development to Linux so I can get Leiningen 2 and ClojureScript running with zero fuss.<p>All the signs were there: The mumbling abound about Noir being ""dead;"" Grainger doing Light Table; no word about updates.<p>I agree that Clojure is not a good language for using frameworks, and the community, I think, has done an excellent job of standing behind this philosophy, as I am sure Hickey likes it. Noir, at least for me, was the perfect balance of getting something put together for a new person, as it didn't enforce anything seemingly unnatural or make any demands on what to use or how to use it. In simple terms, it gave me a lot of freedom to explore without hanging a noose around my head.<p>I never built a website before the two I wrote in Noir, but Noir, or rather, Lisp, let me see the possibilities of all the power that was available without ever having to search. I had an amazing experience, and probably one of the hurdles I'll always look back at and thing that was a step that made me a better programmer. I showed off this really cool thing I figured out and showed it off to people, and they said: ""Yeah, programmic routing is really cool."" I was like ""routing?"" Then I spent the rest of the night on the web reading about it.<p>I love Hiccup. Generating hundreds of lines of HTML from vapor is an amazing feeling. I love bcrypt. I don't know how to hash my data, but at least I know that Noir picked the best damn option. Every time I opened my code, I always felt that Clojure and Noir had the answer and it never let me down.<p>But here, the maintainers are saying that even Noir was too much framework for Clojure, and that Noir complected, and that to really get the full power of Clojure, it's time to let go. It's a scary thought, to leave Noir behind and venture off into my own without the feeding bottle with the idea that Noir was good enough, but oh how much have I learned, and how much more can I learn?<p>Thank you Chris and Raynes! I'm a better programmer because of you guys, and I am going to better yet thanks to both of you.<p>Does this mean Korma is heading off into oblivion as well?",1355461004

4919657,comment,4919111,4919592,4,0,saurik,,,"> ...it would be great if replies at a certain depth were collapsed automatically...<p>I agree: I love that feature. However, Reddit then has the problem that you often find a really stupid comment rebutted by the most exciting and interesting comment on the entire thread; in such a situation, the stupid comment gets downvoted and manages to auto-collapse away the juicy gold hiding below. Slashdot handled this better: they auto-collapse threads, but if an auto-collapsed thread contains a highly-ranked comment, it ""bubbles out""... as in, you can still see it, even though its parent has been collapsed... I'm not certain how to best describe it, but it is amazingly useful.<p>> I also wish there was some way to encourage concision in comments. ... The article itself is only 1541 words (and I didn't read the whole of that either).<p>This community seems to encourage well-thought-out replies; I could technically have posted a ""blog response"", but I find it more interesting to end up in conversations in the comments of the articles where I think of things to write. (I may actually soon start a more real blog, but I've always seen that as an awkward way to do back/forths.) Personally, I find the longer comments to be the ones that are more valuable, and would rather short comments be discouraged ;P.<p>(Another solution to this, btw, is to just have comments get collapsed to something that then has a ""Read More"" that inline-expands to the full comment; this is how Facebook solves this, as otherwise it would become a problem that your Timeline or Newsfeed was dominated by a couple very long posts instead of being an overview of the material available. As someone who actually does read and value long comments, however, I have mixed feelings about this. I mean, if you didn't read the whole of the article, it becomes difficult to really comment on it effectively: it doesn't take that long.)",1355460648

4919652,comment,4919287,4919287,1,0,anakanemison,,,"This product (might someday) solve a real problem I have: one significant impediment to picking up a new web app is the need to learn yet another way of interfacing with the content I ""own"" on it.<p>If Collections can provide a compelling consistent interface on top of existing web apps, and an API for new web apps to target, then they might get to own some valuable conceptual real estate in user's minds: ""I'm willing to try this new service because I already know how I'll be able to manage my content on it"".<p>This also makes the world a better place by making it easier on the newcomers--it's unfair to them that established players occupy the ""I know how to use this already"" space in users' heads, that their service has to not just be better, but be <i>that</i> much better than the established players, to reach people.<p>Then they could use that conceptual real estate to promote those new web apps, and that promotion could yield revenue. Another option would be to wrap their own reference implementations of the services they're abstracting over in a premium layer. Another would be to work with web apps to provide value-added interfaces to the web apps' premium services and take a cut of whatever the web apps charge. Another would be to offer a premium corporate version that plugs into internal corporate datastores (in a way that, presumably, doesn't suck, distinguishing them from other products).<p>Collection's play for native integration (e.g. extending that consistent interface over <i>all</i> your local content) distinguishes them from Dropbox, which prefers to own that content.<p>A similar problem to this, that Collections isn't targeting (yet), is to provide an abstraction not over <i>data</i> but over <i>operations</i>. It's already far too complicated to juggle email, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Gmail, G+, SMS, tumblr, etc. That means that I have to really think hard about letting a new web app into my routine.<p>An intermediary that presents a consistent interface to all those services, and opens itself up for use with new services, could try to win over valuable conceptual space with users and make the world a better place in exactly the same way.",1355460551

4919646,comment,4919111,4919367,15,0,travisb,,,"My take on the entire flat versus threaded discussion is that it boils down to a few facts.<p>1) Outside of computers people don't experience recorded threaded discussions<p>Instead what they experience is much like a flat forum. Everybody talks in chronological order about the current topic at hand. Some small number of side conversations are free to start, but too many and the rooms becomes noisy and all the conversations are hard to follow. If you come to the end of a discussion thread there is no record of the discussion you can refer to and pick the thread up elsewhere. Instead the best that can be done in one participant recalls some kernel of a previous thread and throws that back into the conversation in the hope that other participants will both be interested in discussing it and remember enough of that previous thread to continue.<p>For normal human discussions this is fine; there are a small maximum number of participants, conversations are limited in both time span and time between comment and separating the jumble of chronologically ordered threads is labour intensive.<p>The environment which makes this flat threading model of conversation work in the real world don't hold. An Internet discussion can have hundreds of participants and span weeks with any particular person responding only once a day. With suitable UI the computer can carry the entire burden of organizing and displaying the record of conversation in any subthread of discussion.<p>2) Web forum writers don't pay attention to the lessons of Usenet.<p>Atwood himself mentions Usenet and quickly discards it. This is the single biggest mistake of thread proponents and forum developers. News readers have already tackled the most serious issues with a threaded display with a few powerful techniques:<p>The first is that newsreaders explicitly show their user which posts are new since they've last read the thread. This solves the issues of ""Are there new replies?"" and ""Buried responses"". It does this by allowing users to skip to the next new post quickly as well as to see which subthreads have new replies.<p>The second is that news readers allow the user to trivially close an entire subthread or mark it read. I would argue that this is the second most important feature of any threaded system anywhere and yet is missing in nearly every threaded commenting system. When somebody comes back to a discussion they don't tend to be interested in rereading posts they've already seen. Instead they want to view the new posts yet have the thread context readily available.<p>The lessons of Usenet are not complicated, but they do depend on the understanding that computers should do work for humans. It's more work to track which posts a particular user has read, but it helps the user. It's more work to jump to the next unread post or collapse a subthread in the UI, but it helps the user.<p>3) Nobody seems to realize the UI middle ground between flat and threaded.<p>The vast majority of the cause of threads indenting themselves into infinity is a linear chain of responses, usually two people going back and forth. While this is technically threaded out to infinity, it is effectively a flat discussion in chronological order.<p>Take a look at the threading display Nitpick uses <a href=""http://travisbrown.ca/files/nested_threading.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://travisbrown.ca/files/nested_threading.html</a> .<p>Nitpick doesn't display the technical threading, but instead the effective threading. Instead of indenting a linear series of replies once for each reply, it displays one indentation for the entire linear subthread. When the technical threading doesn't add any information it isn't displayed. You don't have to scroll right and down to read it, just down.<p>It seems that a threaded forum which took these considerations to heart would solve all his issues or at least reduce them to minor annoyances. Yes it's still a tree and as Usenet has shown that's not always enough, but most of the time it is. If the computer provides the necessary tools to navigate to new posts in a thread then it doesn't matter where in a thread the response goes, you'll be able to find it when new trivially. If you don't indent when it doesn't add value you aren't required to scroll left.<p>All this leaves is the fact that you have to scroll down. As you state his complain seems primarily focused on having to close subthreads he isn't interested in. This seems like a feature and not a bug. You can just read downwards, it just takes longer than collapsing the thread. In a flat forum you have no other option but to scroll down.",1355460413

I don't like solutions that put excessive burden on the largest audience of anonymous readers. Write once, read many, and all that.<p>I don't see how collapsing them all to a linear discussion would help this: you simply get one massive topic overtaking the entire conversation, making it impossible to even have the second discussion at all... if the content doesn't get posted because it is off-topic in the linear model, no amount of scrolling will find it.<p>Again, though, this is why almost no sites are actually a linear model; the closest you seem to get to a linear community currently is in the medium of real-time chat, where you still have servers divided into channels, but the channels are relatively fixed and difficult to browse.<p>The result is that you have communities existing within a single server/channel; as an example, there is a community which I started on an IRC server (not iPhone hacking, btw: a bunch of random friends and acquaintances that has grown and shrunk at various points over time, mostly concentrated with people form the small college that I attended) that has existed for years with a single linear thread.<p>Real-time chat, though, is a drastically different kind of medium: handling multiple real-time conversations is simply hard in a way that having multiple asynchronous conversations is not. I maintain, then, that this is why almost no discussion community has ever had a truly linear model: content tends to fall into 4-5 levels of hierarchy, with at least two of them being under direct user control.<p>Once you expand the scope of where you look for the tree in this way, you then note that StackOverflow is actually more threaded than classic discussion forums: of the five levels it has (sites, tags--which I will again explicitly point out is just another hierarchy level where the entries in lower levels might be seen in multiple places--, questions, answers, comments), four of them are under immediate user control, and the fifth is decided by a largely democratic process.<p>In practice, Hacker News threads sometimes get really deep (and I again agree that they can get confusing down there), but the very top-level is sufficiently shallow that you <i>need</i> some of that depth below to have any interesting conversations: if there were only one linear conversation per posted link, things would rapidly get really boring when only one of the politics/economics/etc. angles was able to be covered at a time (by which point the others would have missed their window).<p>Hacker News, does, though, actually have a form of thread limiting; I didn't go into it in detail in my earlier post, but I'll go ahead and do so now: as you get deeper into a thread, the ""reply"" button takes longer and longer to appear. This mechanism is actually defeat-able (which is funny, and some might argue a bug: you click ""link"", and on the comment's own page you can always reply immediately), but it still does help slow the rate at which a thread can get very deep.",1355460267

It's a lot more complex than Roots however the goal of the project is to make it easy for developers to build websites and applications. It'll come with a full featured and extendable admin control panel and built in support for all the common stuff like authentication, user Management, content management, blog posts, asset publishing, etc.<p>The nodejs side handles the API which automatically generates REST routes for your resources, and you have the ability to write custom API endpoints as well.<p>The website and admin panel are automatically built using Grunt and require.js and depend only on the API so you're free to host your website on S3 or another server entirely. The client-side website will call the API for content, authentication, etc. The admin panel is written in AngularJS (So far it's incredibly responsive and feels almost native!) and it's up to the user what to use for the main website.<p>One nice thing is during development it'll watch your files for changes, rebuild the site on the fly and update the client view using socket.io.  No more constantly refreshing the page after every change! In production mode everything is bundled and minified using r.js.<p>If this sounds interesting to you guys then I should have something to show HN in the next few weeks :)",1355459339

I care about it being informative to ME, and since I'm nowhere near 16 (and we'll just leave it at that), I'm interested in hearing about what is COMMON KNOWLEDGE, therefore NOT unique, to countless kids his age---an age I didn't have to guess at because he did me the favor of telling us.<p>If there's an element of, ""look at me"" in his headline, how is that different from every other headline on HN and every other news site? The headline tells you what the ""hook"" is, and if you aren't interested, move on to the next hook.<p>And if your point is that the site is cluttered with contributions announcing a kid's age, well how many more contributions are there announcing, ""well, that wasn't very interesting to me""?<p>To the OP: You did fine, kid. All publishers in all media get the approval of only a fraction of their potential audience. The best anyone ever does is to interest a small sliver of humanity. Listen to feedback, but be aware that it will be all over the map, from ""Love it, do more!,"" to ""Hate it, shut up!"", to stone silence and background crickets.

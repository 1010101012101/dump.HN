7520862,comment,7520100,7520574,1,0,vertex-four,,,"> Due to the hashrate arms race, tremendous amounts of power are being wasted doing nothing useful.<p>But they are doing something useful. They&#x27;re preventing someone from turning up and performing a 51% attack, thus ensuring the security of the network. You could suggest that there&#x27;s better ways of doing that, but our ideas so far haven&#x27;t panned out.<p>Interestingly, how it works at the moment is that essentially, through the mining of bitcoins, every bitcoin holder&#x27;s bitcoins are devalued to pay for the security of the network. Therefore, if a significant amount of bitcoin holders decided that they could deal with less network security, they would use a coin which provided less network security (by paying miners less).<p>As it is, at the moment, we&#x27;re not sure exactly how much security we need. Therefore, we&#x27;re willing to pay for as much security as possible; nobody wants their bitcoins to be worthless tomorrow because they didn&#x27;t pay enough to protect the network.",1396497571

We can see this in [a] when we ask for the domain of the function, and thus we can redefine some function f&#x27; as a piecewise function which is defined to have f&#x27;(0)=1, but in proofs we must thus make sure to first prove that using f&#x27; as a substitute for f does not affect our result.<p>In one of the below posts we have the suggestion<p>> But what if you&#x27;re in a context where you&#x27;re not reasoning about continuous functions at all? Why would you have to be subject to reasoning that doesn&#x27;t apply to your situation?<p>In this case you could either do the above, if you have to concern yourself with e.g. a domain of the set of real numbers arbitrarily close to the undefined location. Alternatively you could just define our original function f only for real numbers greater than 0, in which case you escape the necessity of redefining functions to be easier to work with.<p>[a]: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=domain+of+f%28x%29+%3D+x%2Fx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=domain+of+f%28x%29+%3D+...</a>",1396497567

But it should have been the default - to me WinMain() is just a failure to understand what is best exposed and what is best encapsulated. My boilerplate reduction proposal is to provide a few helper functions to optionally avoid exposure to some of the pipework - just to make life a bit easier when starting out. MFC on the other hand is a massive new layer of compromises and other crud slapped over the top of the Win32 API - somehow managing to make it even more cryptic (YMMV). Also MFC postdated the Win32 API by a few years, so presumably wasn&#x27;t considered as the first choice solution at the start.

For heavy algorithmic-intensive stuff, you&#x27;d often just record your loop counters, key invariants, and exit conditions, and then log them all at once when the algorithm exits.<p>I have little embedded systems experience, but what I gather from talking to folks who do is that they also use logging APIs, but they avoid logging from inside a hot inner loop (their log statements are usually around startup/initialization and when the system receives certain inputs), and they use custom log writers that write the logs to a host server or desktop system when plugged in for debugging rather than taking up storage space on the device itself.",1396497291

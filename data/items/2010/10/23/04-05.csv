It almost ruined the launch, which had a hard deadline. Fortunately we too had an understanding client, but being hamstrung was no fun at all.<p>The issue of the App Engine status page not reflecting reality is a very real one - we had contact with a Google engineer who told me that ""this is affecting all our stuff"" and I know that it went on for several days, but this wasn't reflected in the status chart; the severity of the issue was definitely not conveyed well enough.<p>I like the promise of App Engine, particularly the ""instant"" scalability which is great for sites that you know are going to get hammered as soon as they go live.

I seem to recall a compiler optimisation which would make the assumption that the shift count would be well defined, and so it could then do some other optimisation (e.g. maybe that shift count was then used in a loop later, you can then assume that the loop runs less than 31 times)<p>Also in your example, you should have said sizeof(int)*CHAR_BIT == 32 :)",1287809874

The only one that is viable anymore is the MS Ergo 4000, which, while nice, is not ideal.

1822671,comment,1819267,1821777,0,0,TheNewAndy,,,"Yes, however to get these, you are now in C99 land, which excludes you from some compilers (the obvious one is the MS compiler). What we do is define our own compiler abstraction which can use stdint.h on C99 compilers, and typedef standard types into C99 versions for other compilers.<p>So, once you have a working stdint-like thing you then usually want the ""least"" (or maybe ""fast"") variants of them instead:<p>uint_least8_t, int_least16_t etc.<p>These have the advantage of being actually guaranteed to exist (the exact size variants are only required to exist if the compiler exposes those types, and they are 8, 16, 32 or 64-bits (from memory)). This means that if you are running on a 24-bit chip (e.g. char==short==int==24-bit, long==48-bit) your code will still work good (where not working good could mean that it doesn't compile because it is missing types, or it could mean that it compiles, but is really slow as it is emulating un-naturally sized types)<p>On the other hand, the type int_least8_t must exist. (as must 16, 32 and 64). However, to do the 64-bit type, you have to be careful, as C90 doesn't require a 64-bit type, so a fallback abstraction usually needs compiler specific tricks (""long long"" is a safe bet).<p>Of course, if you <i>actually</i> wanted a type that is exactly 16-bits wide, then use these types, as that is what they are for... but usually you don't care if it is bigger.<p>And this is why the normal char/short/int/long types are good: They don't over-specify.",1287809313

There are a fair number of gotchas with PHP, but I think the docs are generally great, mostly thorough and usually easy to find what you are looking for, everything is in one central place and user comments/examples can be incredibly helpful. I'm able to write fast, efficient code in PHP quickly. It's not going to win a race against C any time soon, but for what it is it's pretty quick, and of course there are a large number of extensions available for it that are written in C. I'm sure it's not the same for everyone, but the amount of time it takes me to write code in PHP is significantly less than any other language I've messed with.<p>Note: While the vast majority of my work these days is done in PHP, previously I worked almost entirely in C++. I've also used/dabbled in Perl, COBOL, BASIC, VBA, Java, Javascript, Python, AS3, Lisp. I've also looked at some Ruby code, maybe changed 3 lines of it in my entire life. ;)",1287808851

Counterintuitive, I know. But if you've been staring at something for too long, you might be too close to the problem to objectively assess it.<p>I don't have answers to your questions.

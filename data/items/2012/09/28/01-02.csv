4583957,comment,4583437,4583534,3,0,gatordan,,,"It's strange how convenient and accepted unchecked anecdotal evidence can be around here under certain circumstances . If this was a strictly tech article I would hope more people would be saying your sample size here is two or three, that's clearly not the best predictor of the future. But you're talking about race and gender from the majority white male centered perspective so your comment is at the top.<p>According to you a couple black people got farther than they should have because of affirmative action and because of that you wouldn't blame an employer for considering all black people ""risky"" hires. Doesn't that sound a bit ridiculous? Put another way, has anyone ever said ""a couple white people screwed over the team a few years back so we think twice nowadays before hiring white people"". Or ""we found that guys seem to slack more during work hours and now we shy away from hiring men"". Of course not, because white and male are normal when it comes to jobs in tech and so they enjoy the privilege of being treated as individuals. To drive the point home your bias is obvious in your comment - ""you're going to naturally think 2 and 3 times before making a similar hire"" - ""similar"" applies to black or female because it's understandable to aggregate those individuals, their actions easy fit into a narrative that already exists in your mind. Pick two white men at your work who consistently perform poorly and I don't think you would be as comfortable attributing their behavior to their race or gender.",1348797510

I was assuming that was the case but the login/creation page needs to have a graphic or a narrative talking about what it does and how the process works a bit more before it reaches a more public audience.

Great, right?  It's great for those that are hired; not so much for everyone else.<p>Say you make the gender ratio 50%.  You hire 500 women and 500 men from the top tier.  Every first-class company like Google or Facebook adopts this strategy.  This means that the odds of being hired at a first-class company is 50% for women in the top tier, and only 5% for men in the top tier.  For every interview a woman does, a man must do ten.  Eventually all the slots in all first-class companies are filled up, leaving some top-tier men working for second class companies--but no top tier women are working for second class companies.",1348797403

It is tempting to believe that the level of instrumentation that Bret proposes could be achieved automatically, just as it was once dreamed that formal methods could be fully automatic. But experience with formal methods has shown us that while some of their promise can be implemented by automatic tools, and this is valuable, to realize their full potential for a complex project requires substantial effort, non-reusable effort.",1348797339

Assuming that the Martian canyons and valleys that appear to be carved out by water were actually carved out by water, they were absolutely torrential floods - of a scale unlike ever seen on Earth. Now? Ice glaze. Polar snow flurries. Underground ices. Hypersaline water tables, perhaps.

(She did get a masters though.)<p>I've encountered some black people in the work place who I suspect were continuing to coast on affirmative action and willingness to accuse others of discrimination.  They are a clear minority of the blacks that I've worked with.  Furthermore I've never seen any of that minority manage to get good referrals from anyone I'd be interested in working with.<p>That said, there are some dysfunctional organizations out there where managers can find it easier to promote their problem employees to be someone else's problem than they do to fire them.  Someone whose success was entirely dependent on affirmative action might do well in such an organization.  My last experience with such an organization was fairly brief and was about 15 years ago.  (I reached the point where I had to decide between finding a better job or filing a sexual harassment lawsuit against the man I was reporting to.  Yes, that happens to men as well.

I-- I-- I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out. I didn't know what I wanted to do! And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it... I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet. Right through my forehead. And I thought... my God... the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they... were stronger than we.<p>Seriously. This whole idea was the brink of draconian tyranny. When things like this started transpiring five and ten years ago, I immediately withdrew from ALL social media websites, and vowed never to abide by real identity demands on any social website that intended to publish it publicly.<p>I swore to myself that I would debate any rotten hiring goon into the ground, if I was ever asked such a question during an interview. Not that I would even want to stay on at such a work place, but just to see if they were smart enough to tolerate my brand of dissent. If inflexible, I would instantly walk out, and threaten (an empty threat) to sue.<p>It's not just about the invasion of privacy an and employers pervasive, stifling surveillance of subordinates. What integrity is there to a Facebook account? Nothing more than an e-mail address is required to create one. E-mail addresses are free and plentiful. More e-mail addresses could potentially be created than addresses in the entire IPv6 number space, and by corollary, so too with social media accounts.<p>What recourse is there for me to prevent malicious individuals from continually creating fake accounts in my name? Do I have endlessly deep pockets and the spare time it takes to chase down trolls, sue for libel and slander? But how many people have the time to spam and flood the internet with anything they want? What's to stop even me for creating 10,000 fake accounts in my own name? And in doing so, would I forfeit my chances at certain jobs? What absolute twaddle.",1348796812

Is that realistic for 29 days, considering you need to sell 7500 units of the $99 pledge amount? At the end of day 7, Leapmotion had 15,000 applications for a free leap motion device and SDK, and that is a device with a much larger audience.<p>Do you have any investor lined up that would be willing to maybe match a Kickstarter total pledge amount of something realistic like $375k?<p>Have you considered approaching a fund like In-Q-Tel? This seems like the kind of project they would fund, since I imagine a lot of the best parallel computing work is being done in government-funded agencies and labs. I also imagine the government is probably the biggest employer of people working on parallel processing devices. With that in mind, getting a device like this into the hands of many, allows more people to get hands on exposure to parallel computing.<p>Overall, it feels like the funding strategy needs to be diversified, because I imagine it will be difficult to get $750k all from one source, with the exception of a VC fund whose thesis aligns with your goals.<p>Lastly, it feels like a project like this would be a bit too soon. Many developers who are playing with hardware have been playing around with the arduino for a few years, some are now graduating to the Raspberry Pi, which offers clear benefits over the Arduino because you can run tons of stuff simply not possible on the Arduino. However as the Raspberry Pi just came out, I imagine that most developers are still trying to get their hands on something like it and still don't feel the pain of trying to solve problems with it, that could only be solved with something like the parallella.<p>As a hobbyist, besides exploring parallel computing for its own sake, what other kinds of problems can I explore/solve with the parallella which simply wouldn't be possible on the raspberry pi? Sell a dream and possibilities here. I'm personally not familiar with what would only be possible on a parallella and I might feel more interested in this project if I know why I'd want it (besides learning pp for its own sake).",1348795779

If a company wants to hire 1,000 people and 10,000 applicants are in the top 1%, they will move the bar up to hire the top 0.1% instead.<p>Given a normal distirbution of applicants, there is a huge difference in talent (10x?) between top 1% and top 0.1%.  The bar always automatically adjusts higher; otherwise, a competitor will hire the fraction of the 0.1% that you've passed over.  Now the competitor has a 1,000 workers, and you have 1,000 workers, but the competitors are 10x more talented for the same pay (most of the 0.1% didn't get an offer from you, so there's no bidding war for their talents).<p>Actually, if a company spends more money recruiting each equivalent female employee than male employee, they do effectively drop their total hiring bar if spending more money lets the company climb the bell curve, because it's effectively a reduction in spending efficency, but that effect is small, and skill parity is still achieved.",1348795181

Luck, not a good broker, makes you the first one in. And in the end, finding a good apartment, and finding a good broker (with that kind of access) are equivalent problems.<p>In NYC last year it took me almost 3 months to find a decent apartment. I found the broker on Craiglist (of all places), he pulled a bait and switch on the apartment he'd listed, but it turned out to be a switch for the better. I was the first one who ever saw the apartment, because it wouldn't even be officially listed until the next day, but he was friends with mgmt, and I said yes on the spot. I grudgingly paid the broker's fee, despite only having spent 20 min with him. But I'd already met with probably 15 different brokers (some of them just horrible) showing 25 different apartments (most of them just horrible) before that. In the end, it's certainly not like any broker saved me any time or money. I just kept at it until I got lucky -- most apartments, esp. the good ones, just seem to come with brokers ""attached"" that you're required to use, and very often exclusive brokers, which means it's not like any other broker has access to them anyways.",1348794713

MS hired only five interns from my school that year, and all were female, which is pretty remarkable given my school's sub 5% female representation. I also had an offer from IBM's Extreme Blue that summer, which I don't think had much to do with being female.<p>I also think being female made it a little easier to get my resume noticed, coming from a large state school. It probably helped me get my Google interview, but I don't think it actually helped me get the job much.<p>There have also been some negative things about being a woman in technology. Everyone has their advantages and disadvantages in life.",1348794172

Because it engenders discrimination.<p>Women are different to men - culturally, biologically, etc et al. However any reference/inference/undertone to those differences as being 'risky' or 'negative' to business re-enforces negative stereotypes.<p>As the studies are showing, there's an opportunity cost to not achieving gender balance in business.

The APIs for the latest release are the ICS APIs which is OK since most devs will still be targeting Froyo or Gingerbread for another year or so.  The only problem is if you use some of the Google APIs, mainly Maps, in which case you'll have to get clever, either with reflection or your build system, to include Amazon's maps in your app.<p>If Amazon ever tries to do a major fork at the API level we'll be in trouble, but they have shown no sign of that as of yet.",1348794016

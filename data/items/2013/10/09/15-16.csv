6522072,comment,6520932,6521595,1,0,jacquesm,,,"You don&#x27;t think the flogging would be done in the market square do you?<p>Corporeal punishments were not abolished because they are a way to exemplify what is wrong with a society but because they are inhumane. Prison can also be inhumane but you can&#x27;t successfully attack the prison system by proposing a barbarian alternative, you need to offer a <i>better</i> option and just highlighting what&#x27;s wrong with imprisonment does not in any way address the underlying issues and those have little to nothing to do with race, even though there definitely is a bias.<p>Prison is a means of last resort to remove dangerous entities from society for a while and to rehabilitate them, even the most civilized countries have them and for those countries flogging as an alternative is not an option.<p>The societal wrongs in the USA are not going to be fixed by attacking a symptom, they need to be fixed by addressing root causes:<p>- poverty<p>- unemployment<p>- drug use / abuse & associated laws (treat\n  drug use as a personal healthcare issue \n  rather than a criminal one).<p>All of these are social issues that either lead to crime or that have been criminalized. Only much later in the chain does the word &#x27;prison&#x27; appear and unless you address those root causes the prisons will remain.<p>Provocative, sure. Practical, no and it isn&#x27;t going to convince any person that still needs convincing.<p>What will work to convince people that this is not the way is to show the benefits to society as a whole from walking a different path, as long as those that make the decision are not at risk of suffering the consequences of those decisions that is very much an uphill battle.<p>Once drug users and unemployed people make it to the ballots and get elected you can expect some change in this respect from experience until then you&#x27;re going to have to convince the elected officials that they are harming societies interests as a whole, which is a far more powerful argument than any medieval style provocative comparison will be able to do. Short term thinking vs long term thinking. What prisons look like and how they function is secondary to changing society so people do not have a large chance of ending in prison in the first place.",1381334387

And it was done completely against the wishes of the Nobel family.<p>>Members of the Nobel family are among the harshest, most persistent critics of the economics prize, and members of the family have repeatedly called for the prize to be abolished or renamed. In 2001, on the 100th anniversery of the Nobel Prizes, four family members published a letter in the Swedish paper  Svenska Dagbladet, arguing that the economics prize degrades and cheapens the real Nobel Prizes.<p>>Most recently, in 2004, three prominent Swedish scientists and members of the Nobel committee published  an open letter in a Swedish newspaper savaging the fraudulent scientific credentials of the Swedish Central Bank Prize in Economics. The economics prize diminishes the value of the other Nobel prizes. If the prize is to be kept, it must be broadened in scope and be disassociated with Nobel, they wrote in the letter, arguing that achievements of most of the economists who win the prize are so abstract and disconnected from the real world as to utterly meaningless.<p>If you&#x27;d like to read about the history of the scam that is the &quot;Nobel Prize in Economics&quot;, there&#x27;s plenty more in this article:\n<a href=""http://www.alternet.org/economy/there-no-nobel-prize-economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alternet.org/economy/there-no-nobel-prize-economi...</a>",1381333539

The hard parts are a: not giving up (actually, that hasn&#x27;t been hard), and b: using the time you have efficiently.<p>There are a number of paths available to you:\n1. Give up. \n2. Quit dayjobbing, go full-time on your savings in hopes it will succeed (part-time freelancing is a partial version of this).\n3. Get funded and work off the funding. \n4. Get a revenue-generating product out the door so it starts paying for you to work full-time.<p>I don&#x27;t believe in #1. I can&#x27;t do #2 because my marriage is more important than my startup. I looked into #3, but fundraising is a full-time job that takes your eye off the ball with no guarantee of success. This leaves #4.<p>So consider a way to build a subset of your product you can sell, or otherwise shorten your takeoff trajectory. That will get you going faster.<p>As for the freelancing idea... unless you think you can immediately get half-time freelance work and keep a steady flow of it, it&#x27;s not a good path.

6521899,comment,6521891,6521891,1,0,gwern,,,"Some relevant excerpts:<p>&quot;There has been considerable recent disappointment with the failure of a number of major new pharmacological strategies for the treatment of chronic heart failure. In turn, there has been much speculation as to why trials of these therapies have not shown benefit. Among a number of plausible and scientifically valid reasons, consideration should be afforded to the potential contribution of &quot;regression to the truth.&quot; Regression to the truth derives from the biological concept of regression to the mean, whereby random fluctuations in a biological variable occur over time, such that the true value of the variable is approached with repeated measurements. This same concept can be applied to clinical trial programs for new drugs for heart failure. Because only strongly positive trials generally go on to phase III testing, and some of these early phase studies are positive by chance alone, on retesting in phase III the results are very likely not be as strongly positive. Numerous examples of regression to the truth apply for trials of heart failure therapies, as well as in other areas.<p>To understand regression to the truth we must first consider the concept of regression to the mean. This concept derives from the random fluctuations that can occur in a variable over time. As a consequence, a single measurement of that variable more often yields a value removed from the mean, and the &quot;true&quot; value of the variable is approached with repeated measurements. As a corollary, in population studies, a single measurement of the dependent variable - for example, cholesterol - can lead to an underestimate of the strength of its association with an outcome such as coronary heart disease death (&quot;regression distribution bias&quot;). Consider a theoretical drug (drug x) being studied to determine its benefit in heart failure, as assessed by a surrogate measure, lowering of plasma norepinephrine (Fig. 1). The left panel shows that there is really no difference in plasma norepinephrine levels before and after drug x. However, the investigators went on to perform a subgroup analysis of those patients with norepinephrine levels above the mean (middle panel), and that subgroup demonstrated a significant reduction in norepinephrine levels with drug x. The investigators might therefore claim that drug x is effective in lowering plasma norepinephrine in patients with high norepinephrine levels. Furthermore, it is these patients (ie, patients with high levels) who are those that are particularly in need of a drug that will lower such elevated levels. Although it is possible that drug x does indeed lower elevated plasma norepinephrine levels, it is equally plausible (if not more so) that the high plasma levels were &quot;captured&quot; as being falsely or atypically high (for the individual patient) at baseline and then when the same patients were remeasured at a later time point, levels were not as high (ie, classic regression to the mean).\nThis concept is well-understood for a biologic variable, but how can this concept be applied to that of a clinical trial program for a new drug for heart failure? This is conceptually illustrated in Fig. 2, which depicts early phase trials conducted in the assessment of a variety of potential new drug therapies for heart failure. Each dot represents a trial of a certain drug. As can be seen, some early phase studies will be strongly negative, some strongly positive, but most will cluster around neutrality and, therefore, one can construct a standard bell-shaped curve. We know that many trials of new chemical entities are conducted in the setting of heart failure. Because of the large number of studies conducted, some will be positive by chance and indeed some will be strongly positive by chance. Does this matter? Yes, it does. It is highly likely that only drugs associated with strongly positive trials (ie, those to the right of the vertical dotted line) will go on to phase III testing. Because some of these studies that are positive by chance alone will be among these, then when retested in phase III trials, the results will no longer be strongly positive. This is analogous to the high plasma cholesterol or norepinephrine being retested in the earlier examples. This concept is true, not just of heart failure trials, but of any drug therapy for any specific indication. What exacerbates the problem in the setting of chronic heart failure is the low percentage strike rate in the development of successful pharmacologic therapies for this condition. Only renin-angiotensin and -adrenoceptor blocking agents have come to the market over the last 30 years or so.\nTherefore, very few promising drugs in early phase would be positive in phase III (if tested) and thus registrable for a heart failure indication. This is illustrated by the open circles below the curved line, interposed on the totality of early phase trials in Fig. 2. This line is curved because, of course, a strongly positive early phase study will make it more likely (but possibly still with low probability) of positive findings in phase III studies. Nevertheless, this still leaves a large number of trials strongly positive in early phase by chance alone (circled cluster) &quot;regressing to the truth.&quot;&quot;",1381333043

There&#x27;s no technical restriction or necessity against (well, necessity is up for debate), but there is a legal prohibition on commercial or encrypted transmissions; I read recently that it was being discussed to change this.  I guess it would have been reported on HN frontpage if this had gone through.<p>The argument as I understand it is that Ham bands are a shared, public resource (commons) and that their use is strongly regulated by the FCC (and presumably some international body I haven&#x27;t heard of); if your communications were encrypted, you would be free to violate the rules and engage in commercial activity, which would likely make the band a lot more popular, polluted, and less available as a limited resource for amateur licensed users.

6521806,comment,6521221,6521531,1,0,Tanner,,,"I&#x27;ve recently installed Arch on two different laptops.<p>The first one was an old netbook. I hadn&#x27;t done an Arch install in a long time (I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the simplicity and convenience of the Wubi installer) and wanted the learning experience. I also wanted the HDD to be encrypted using dmcrypt and LUKS.<p>The main problem I had was wrapping my head about the various partition schemes. This was made more difficult by my insistence to have the HDD be encrypted which meant I needed a separate /boot partition along with the special 1MB linux boot partition required to use GPT with BIOS (I missed that in the instructions and it tripped me up for quite a while). Altogether, it took three fresh installs before everything was exactly the way I wanted it but the last one was quite quick and was really on a fresh install because I wanted to make absolutely sure I had everything nailed down.<p>The second laptop was a midrange, 2 year old HP &quot;media&quot;-style laptop. With my new knowledge, partitioning and installing was easy even while maintaining an existing Windows install. But this laptop has both Intel and Nvidia graphics shared via PowerXpress whereas the netbook has simple Intel graphics. I still haven&#x27;t taken a stab at the proprietary drivers but using the open source intel and nvidia graphics in tandem (after some fumbling around but it seemed counterintuitive to simply install both drivers side-by-side) it works well enough for what I&#x27;m using it for. I don&#x27;t really relish the prospect of installing the proprietary Nvidia drivers, though.<p>I&#x27;ve probably spent 20 hours installing Arch on both of these machines but I&#x27;ve learned a lot in the process.

A little CO emission is expected during the normal operation of gas/wood burning appliances. A CO detector at the ceiling might go off when it detects these little &#x27;puffs&#x27; of CO.

And that&#x27;s because those highly educated within the government body understand that those here working ilegally became a part of economical system long time ago. Some say its a cancer, but try to take away cigarettes from your 80-years old grandmother that smoked her whole life and you will see how her body shuts itself down.<p>Now, let me show you how this works in very basic terms.<p>Joonix is living a decent life with his wife and kids. They are happy middle class family, with loan on the house, bills paid on time, car loan, etc. He and his wife makes an average salary but combined they can afford most stuff a family would dream of.<p>Now, by some magic wand all illegal immigrants are removed from this country. Overnight. He comes back from work on Monday and opens up his mailbox. Bunch of mail, mostly bills, as usual. Uh no! his cable bill just went up by 150%. The letter does not explain why. He calls in and is explained that it turned out that an outsourcer of the outsourcer of another outsourcer they been legally and lawfully using for technical support, fixing modems, supporting infrastructure, hooking up cable boxes etc, was hiring illegals for $5 per hours. Now they had to be replaced by natural-born US citizens that in most cases won&#x27;t move their finger for less than $9 per hour, because - well you have wellfare and obamacare and all those social programs that are free. And besides those sweat breaking jobs are in some cases just too bad for their reputation or self esteem. So now to justify the pricing (after all, cable companies are not in the charity business, but rather designed to make money), they jacked up his $127/month 200 channels TV bill to $280. Joonix is angry and don&#x27;t understand. But hey, no worries after all we are living in a competitive market. He calls in another cable company and gets even higher quote -- that second company decided to take advantage of the new law that removed all illegals and jacked up price even more. All night of shopping for new cable left him with no choice than to pay 150% more what he did last month, or shut off his TV forever. He wakes up the next day to go to work. His law is in awful shape -- ugh, the service lawn company went out of business. The new staff they had was too expensive and in some cases new employees did not even care to show up to work. He drives to the gas station. Prices went up 20%. Someone tries to explain him the employment chain that takes place from the moment an oil barrel is sucked out of earth and gets delivered to his local gas station. Lots of illegals involved. Now the price is $8 per gallon. Joonix complains but the gas station owner bashes him that he should be proud -- after all, no illegal hands touched the gas he pumped in his car. He gets to work. His boss has some good news and some bad news. Good news is that all illegals are gone. Bad news is that 97% of the stuff will be let go. After all, no fraud or illegals to fight with. After work he goes to a local shop market. Pricing for most food items went up from 80% to 250%. Most agricultural companies were forced to raise prices aggressively because they could not outsource field work to some other companies that were hiring illegals. He comes home. Air condition unit just died. He calls in -- a man with perfect american accent answers. He can send someone same day to check it out for $180 per hour, no guarantees. The ad he hold in his hand from last month ValvePack says $39.99. Joonix sits down with his wife looking through the bills. Everything went up tremendously. They have no idea how they will afford tomorrow. Perhaps they will have to let the house go? They may be forced to be homeless, but at least they will be homeless in the country where everyone is a US citizen. They fall asleep holding hands, proud to be americans.",1381331827

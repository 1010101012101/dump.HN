We definitely don&#x27;t have the biggest brains.<p>Sometime in the evolutionary process, we developed the ability to speak. Chimpanzees have symbolic capacities which are rarely used in the wild. Something happened to us, some social change and we&#x27;ve been practicing this ability since tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago.<p>And speech is tremendously important because that&#x27;s how we learn - we pass and receive knowledge to and from others by means of natural language. Society also leaped forward along with agriculture because that&#x27;s when written language happened, also allowing us to pass knowledge to future generations. We also leaped forward when common people started learning to read. And because of the ease of access to information nowadays, I also believe we&#x27;re amidst another revolution.<p>Now if you look at animals, they do have language. Most intelligent animals rely on body language and even sounds to communicate. But one thing that we do effortlessly is to invent new words, new metaphors to describe whatever we want and our language has gotten so big that we can describe anything.<p>So there&#x27;s a strong correlation there and the question on my mind is - are we smart because of the ability to communicate, or are we able to communicate because we are smart?",1392123121

Obviously not every aspect of of the development process can be predicted, nor are projects enough alike to be produced by an assembly line.

A chip designer can predict that a working CPU can be designed and built. An automobile designer can predict that a working car can be made. And these processes are repeatable.

Failures occur in these realms, too, but not nearly as often as with software projects.<p>I&#x27;ve heard the argument that software development is different: it&#x27;s a creative process, the people are idiosyncratic, the problems are unpredictable.

It consisted of a little bit of classroom basics k-maps, binary/hex/octal math, gate logic, etc mixed with a lab that took a breadboard and applied the knowldge you learned in the classroom to make blinky lights/sounds. Not very impressive, but in the course of making the light blink you learn rules for debugging systems that are applicable everywhere (change only one thing, then test after every change, think about what each change means in terms of expected output given an input, etc). If you know how to do basic electronics going in, you have an easy A and a bunch of free time. If you are learning it all for the first time, you probably spend 10-15 hours a week on a 3 hour lab until it clicks.<p>The class had something like a 90% pass rate so I don&#x27;t think this is something that can&#x27;t be taught with a mixture of normal classroom plus TA+Prof help in labs.",1392121199

We invest a lot in improving the systems to monitor and remove fake likes from the system, and also in helping advertisers set smart targeting to help them reach the people they care most about.<p>Has no one ever suggested being able to add targeting filters to target users with a total number of likes between x and y? It may seem counter intuitive, however it would allow people to stop targeting users who don&#x27;t like anything and avoid those who like everything (and therefore can&#x27;t possibly engage with all their likes).<p>To me this seems like the obvious solution (with a bit of tweaking to the upper bound), however as the video states this could be negative for Facebook to implement due to the (denied) benefit of fake likes to them. With this implemented however, it could possibly force the click farms to be maintaining simultaneous accounts to keep their total likes down?<p>Looking at my own Facebook account, I have 46 likes, so surely a company wishing to advertise, would want to advertise with; if they targeted adverts to users with above 2 likes and below ~500 whom are also within they&#x27;re usual specific filters and regions they are more likely to reach their desired audience of active users.

(I&#x27;m EFF&#x27;s International Director, btw)<p>The short answer is that you&#x27;re signing your support for a  set of 13 principles on the application of human rights to communications surveillance ( see <a href=""https://necessaryandproportionate.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://necessaryandproportionate.net/</a> ), that were worked out last year (pre-Snowden, actually) by a coalition of technologists, privacy activists, and legal scholars.<p>The long answer: We&#x27;ve been using this language to push the idea in international venues and among key lawmakers in various countries that mass surveillance (as well as a bunch of other practices conducted by the NSA and other spooks, including corruption of crypto standards and backdoors) is a violation of existing human rights standards.<p>This is important internationally because if the NSA gets away with its current behaviour, it&#x27;ll establish a norm that such surveillance is okay for any government to conduct. We need to push back against that norm.<p>To do so, diplomats, policymakers and others need language and arguments to back that up.<p>The Principles give them that language in a familiar context (and we&#x27;re working together to provide more detailed arguments and other legal guides). It has found favor among politicians, experts and other influential people I think partly because the smarter ones are genuinely worried that pervasive surveillance really could undermine their own societies -- they recognise what it could do in the wrong hands as much as anyone else.<p>In providing that leverage, it helps to convey that it&#x27;s not just a bunch of domain experts that think forbidding mass surveillance is a bad idea, but that an increasingly large number of citizens find it abhorrent. That&#x27;s what the signatures will do. It really makes a difference in this arena, because so few obscure technical documents have hundreds of thousands of supporters :)<p>I&#x27;d encourage anyone who wants to understand better how we&#x27;re trying to get all governments, not just the US, to craft better surveillance legislation to read the full text of the principles at <a href=""https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text"" rel=""nofollow"">https://necessaryandproportionate.net/text</a>  You can also ask me questions at danny@eff.org . It&#x27;s a long haul project, and we&#x27;re conducting it alongside legal actions in the US and abroad, shoring up and disseminating crypto tools, and other non-policy defences. But it&#x27;s pretty amazing to get unanimity with hundreds of privacy groups on some basic principles with which to start building proper, 21st century, surveillance law.",1392120008

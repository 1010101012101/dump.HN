9425085,comment,9421831,9424625,0,0,refurb,,,"Heteroaromatic silanes (rings made mostly of carbon but also include a non-carbon atom like nitrogen) are useful synthetic intermediates (you can use them to make other molecules).<p>In the past, you usually made them using precious metal catalysts (really expensive metals like rhodium; the reactions are easy to screw up).  The metal atom basically inserts between the ring and a hydrogen (the outside of the rings are covered in hydrogens).  You then added a silane source and it would displace the metal complex (through a pretty complex pathway) to get your desired product (the original ring with a silicon atom where a hydrogen used to be).<p>This new method creates the exact same product.  However, instead of using a precious metal catalyst, you can just add this really common base (potassium t-butoxide) and your silicon source and &quot;poof!&quot; the reaction is complete.  No expensive reagents!<p>What makes this so science-news worthy is that I don&#x27;t think anyone would have guessed this would have worked.<p>A good analogy would be a really complex math problem.  Folks can solve it, but it&#x27;s a lengthy and complex proof.  Suddenly someone comes by and says &quot;just take the cosine and divide by 9&quot; and you realize that this super simple approach works better than anything else.",1429765109

Just as I was pissed off that so many companies were originally dismissive of me despite my education pedigree, I try not to be dismissive of candidates because they didn&#x27;t happen to use [insert feature].

9425083,comment,9423545,9424609,0,0,3legcat,,,">Is this guy actually writing C++ programs in the wild?<p>Well, I read one of his articles which you can find here:\n<a href=""http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_books.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.artima.com/cppsource/top_cpp_books.html</a><p>In it, he writes about his role with C++:<p>&quot;I’ll begin with what many of you will find an unredeemably damning confession: I have not written production software in over 20 years, and I have never written production software in C++. Nope, not ever. Furthermore, I’ve never even tried to write production software in C++, so not only am I not a real C++ developer, I’m not even a wannabe. Counterbalancing this slightly is the fact that I did write research software in C++ during my graduate school years (1985-1993), but even that was small (a few thousand lines) single-developer to-be-thrown-away-quickly stuff. And since striking out as a consultant over a dozen years ago, my C++ programming has been limited to toy “let’s see how this works” (or, sometimes, “let’s see how many compilers this breaks”) programs, typically programs that fit in a single file. (make? Who needs stinkin’ make?) My living is based on C++, but it’s not by virtue of the programs I write in it.<p>It’s not by virtue of any intimate association with the language’s standardization, either, because I’ve never been a member of the C++ standardization committee, I’ve never been on the committee’s mailing lists, and I’ve never attended any standardization meetings. My knowledge of the inner workings of the committee—including the things that have had a significant impact on it—is based on what I’ve read and heard from others. This means that I may be ignorant of important forces that shaped C++ as we know it, because those forces may have been felt only within the committee.<p>Given that I don’t really use C++, nor do I help specify it, you might wonder what I do do. Fundamentally, I study C++ and its application. I gather as much information as I can about the language and its use (from books, magazines, newsgroups, email and face-to-face conversations with developers and members of the standardization committee, experiments with toy programs I write, etc.), organize and analyze what I find, then I package my findings in concentrated form (e.g., books, magazine articles, technical presentations, etc.) for consumption for people like you—people who do use the language. Your job is to employ C++ as a tool to write useful software. My job is to discover and package the information you need to best apply that tool.<p>I like to think of myself as an outside observer, not too deeply steeped in the day-to-day travails of programmers and not too keenly focused on the minutiae of standardization, yet familiar with both. This series of articles, then, summarizes what this self-proclaimed outside observer thinks have been the most important contributions to C++ since its inception....&quot;",1429764973

But to do that I either need to make a C&#x27; where I take a timeout to explain why I&#x27;m refactoring the code before I move on to D. Or, I need to go re-write A, B, and C so they fit directly into D.<p>Making C` sucks because it&#x27;s irrelevant to whatever the topic is.

I frequented a couple Jingumae spots like the Roastery and Suzu Cafe, Mellow Brown in Jiyugauka, Fuglen in Yoyogi, and a lot of cool or charming spots that had no outlets or wifi but were OK to work from, like Brooklyn Parlor in Shinjuku or some spots around Kichijoji I liked (and of course, Blue Bottle too). Nakameguro had nice little cafes but I never worked from there.<p>Overall Tokyo is not a digital nomad, coffee-shop working friendly city (or at least not like other major international cities), which was both surprising and disappointing, for me.<p>EDIT - I&#x27;ll add the co working spaces I dropped by were all simply terrible.

Dejan had managed to corrupt the internal flash of his hard disk in some way and wanted to know if there&#x27;s a way to either boot the controller from external flash, or a method to re-write the flash. For five days, he doesn&#x27;t get a reponse, but the guy is inventive: the next thing he posts is the message that he has found the pinout of the JTAG-port. That&#x27;s a major find: the JTAG-port can be used to control a controller like a puppet. You can stop it, restart it, modify memory, set breakpoints etc with it. Dejan then figures out how to dump the boot ROM of the controller, figures out there&#x27;s a serial port on one of the hard disk headers and manages to restore his flash ROM. He then dumps a few more bits and pointers about the flash update process before finally disappearing into the mists of the Internet again. &quot;",1429762312

Are you calling a member function from a const or from a non-const pointer? Depending on that you could be running different code.<p>In my opinion you should make your mind about what the class does: is it mutable? then don&#x27;t use it with const. Unfortunately, you are still required to use const in many places: copy constructors and operators, for example. However, you can still choose to minimize the use of const, and avoid it whenever possible.",1429762113

9424953,comment,9421294,9424176,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"There have been a number of studies of lottery winners along these lines. The observation has been made that people who acquire money slowly are more likely to have habits which maximizes retention and extracts the most value out of the capital they hold. Whereas people who are suddenly &quot;rich&quot; often will spend money on things which are expensive but not valuable, and do not provide any sort of &quot;return&quot; (either in capability or value) commensurate with the expenditure. The canonical example is the lottery winner who buys a new luxury car or SUV with all of the options with their winnings rather than buying a reliable economy car and investing the difference cost in either future education for their children or savings against future need. You have to be taught those habits and one way to learn them is to be in a group that is spending recklessly and not getting any value for what they spend money on (learning by observation rather than experience).",1429761917

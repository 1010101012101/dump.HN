4151901,comment,4150926,4151732,2,0,bad_user,,,"Comments such as these are seriously out of touch with reality.<p>For me it is actually rather interesting that they went with HTML first, considering that they had the resources to skip on the HTML version completely. And I'm sure that they did this, not because HTML was the fad of the moment, but because HTML has inherent advantages ... like, when Windows Phone 8 gets released, Facebook will be available for it from day 1, just as it is available on any phone that has a web browser.<p>And of course they had to go native. Developing web apps for mobile phones is extremely painful. For instance the last time I developed something for an iPhone, upload buttons in the browser were disabled. So basically in the name of user experience or whatever the hell reasons Apple is conjuring these days, they deliberately broke the user experience for web apps by not allowing uploads of photos. And considering this is the number 1 use-case for active users of Facebook, they were forced to go native anyway.<p>The alternative road, which both Facebook and Google took, was to wrap that HTML in an app container that would let them bypass the browser restrictions (like uploading of files). But this was a bad idea, at least because the web view on iOS has much worse performance characteristics than the browser. For Facebook at least it's amazing how they accomplished the feat of making the native app more sluggish than loading facebook.com in the browser (which is perfect btw, except that you can't share photos with it and it also doesn't have any mechanism for giving you notifications in real time, but I don't miss that because that's what email is for).",1340487699

4151896,comment,4138570,4141089,1,0,cookiecaper,,,"This is an argument against copyright. I think it's a rather extreme position. Copyright is useful as a concept even if it's gotten completely out of control.<p>The issue with the GPL is that it takes the most critical component of copyright away -- the ability to control the distribution of your work in any meaningful degree (e.g., by charging money for access to it). You can tinker with the copyright code to say that works transformed away from direct human readability (i.e. things that require a machine to be understood, like binary compiled code) are not copyrightable, requiring everyone to release source code, etc., but the premise of freedom 2 is neither self-evident or inviolable. In the real world, people have to make money, and without some form of intellectual property law, any digitized work immediately has an infinite supply, which will always usurp any level of demand no matter how significant, making it impossible to profit off of the digitized work directly.<p>I don't believe there's a moral requirement to allow everyone access to the fruits of your labor for free. If the software generates value for the end-user, it seems fair to expect some recompense for the work you've done. Why do you believe it is unfair to actually make money off the product you build? Do we see people giving grills away for free and attempting to make a living off of ""selling support"" for that grill?",1340487545

Story lists are circulated among the executives. When I was a photographer for Reuters and Sipa (1996-2002), I had, on occasion, photos that would find their way up to the executive level before they'd be released. I can specifically remember my photos from Jasper, Texas and the James Bird Jr. murder getting some extra attention before they went out on the wire. Another situation involved a Black Panther protest and KKK counter-protest at the Gary Graham execution in Huntsville, TX.<p>Executives definitely know what's going on, especially with highly visible targets.<p>Stories are promoted, killed, ""massaged"" or delayed for various reasons by the executives. To believe otherwise is nave.<p>The Times is losing subscribers, losing profits and you bet your ass that reporters are worried about it -- their jobs depend on the company's survival. Apple is increasing profits, hiring people and they're also non-union. Polar opposite of the NY Times organization. I'm not disputing any of the Times's facts, I am disputing the slant. Instead of addressing the very high youth unemployment among recent college graduates, they instead attack a company that's creating jobs -- without government ""stimulus."" That scares the typical Times reporters because it goes against their common refrain that government spending is necessary to save the economy.<p>Apple devices, specifically the iPad have cut into traditional newspaper profits substantially as well. It could be said that the internet killed the newspaper and the iPad is just fast tracking that process. People are consuming more content, but they are paying for it less frequently.<p>They could have run the same article about McDonalds. Billions in worldwide sales, yet cashiers are making low wages with no 401k, no stock purchase and very modest, if any health coverage. Yet, the take on Apple. What's the motivation? Are employees being abused? No. Are they being paid below market value? No. Are they being denied benefits? No.<p>What's the story?

Instead of extending a membrane outward from the cell surface to engulf an external particle, it forms a membrane inside the cell and uses it to engulf some part of the cell's contents. Either way, the result is a membrane-bound bag of stuff, which is then merged with the cell's lysosome, which is full of acid and digestive enzymes.<p>Autophagy is a fairly recently-discovered mechanism (compared to, say, apoptosis), but it already seems to be a universally-used pathway, for everything from killing invading bacteria, to clearing plaques and aggregates of misfolded proteins (such as those that cause neurodegenerative diseases), to self-cannibalizing unnecessary cell components for energy and building blocks during starvation conditions.<p>There's some evidence that autophagy is protective against a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases, so a good bit of research is focused on how to stimulate autophagy in neurons in a safe and controlled fashion (since obviously too much autophagy will kill the cell outright).",1340486968

So China is effectively giving the US a whole bunch of real goods for free, by buying up those treasuries. This may be irrelevant from the financial perspective, but in <i>real terms</i>, this is a huge benefit for the US.<p>That said, the fact that China buys lots of USD doesn't have anything to do with the whole petro-dollar thing.

I guess you can best sum it up like this:<p>Printing money is not inflationary, but spending money can be.<p>Those 14 trillion USD in government debt is held in bonds precisely because those wealthy enough to own them <i>do not want to spend them</i>. So if, all of a sudden, the Fed prints a lot of dollar bills to pay the US debt, what this really means at an operational level is that they print those dollar bills to buy treasuries on the open market and/or buy directly from the government.<p>This simply means that the demand for treasuries increases, which drives up the price of treasuries, which is equivalent to driving down the interest rate on treasuries.<p>To sum it up: if the Fed does what you say, the interest rates will drop further closer to zero, but that's pretty much all that will happen.<p>Now if you think that decreasing interest rates can have secondary effects, then we can talk about those. But given that the interest rate is almost 0% already anyway, it seems unlikely that a small downward change would have a big economic impact.<p>Perhaps you're confusing paying back the debt with actual spending. Paying back the debt is simply an asset/liability swap that doesn't change anybody's wealth, and therefore cannot have inflationary effects. Actual spending is something else, and can be inflationary - though in the current economic climate, you could probably increase government spending significantly (by a trillion or so per year) without creating inflationary trouble.",1340486395

and concrete data. This long-term engagement serves to eliminate most risk to technology transfer from research to engineering. This<p>[...] we blur the line between research and engineering activities and encourage teams to pursue the right balance of each, knowing that this balance varies greatly.<p>Overall, we undertake research work when we feel its substantially higher risk is warranted by a chance of more significant potential impact.<p>we just try to factorize [long-term research] into shorter-term, measurable components.<p>Even if we cannot fully factorize work, we have sometimes undertaken longer-term efforts. For example, we have started multiyear, large systems efforts (including Google Translate, Chrome, Google Health) that have important research components.<p>If the discrete steps required large leaps in vastly different directions, we admit that our primarily hillclimbing-based approach might fail. Thus, we have structured the Google environment as one where new ideas can be rapidly verified by small teams through large-scale experiments on real data, rather than just debated.<p>Organizationally, research is done in situ by the product team to achieve its goals. The most successful high-profile examples of this pattern are systems infrastructure projects such as MapReduce,
Google File System, and BigTable.<p>In our opinion, a research project is successful if it has academic or commercial impact, or ideally, both.<p>Another potential pitfall of the hybrid research model is that it is probably more conducive to incremental research. We therefore do support paradigmatic changes as well, as exemplified by our autonomous vehicles project, Google Chauffeur, among others.<p>Our hybrid approach to research enables us to conduct experiments at a scale that is generally unprecedented for research projects, generating stronger research results that can have a wider academic and commercial impact.<p>While our hybrid research model exploits a number of things particular to Google, we hypothesize that it may also serve as an interesting model for other technology companies.",1340486219

Second, I need to make an effort to recognize the aspects of the thing that are desirable and assume that the things that bother me, don't bother everybody in the same way.

But the grass is not only greener on the Windows side of the fence they have better shader support to make it wave :-) One of the things I had hoped various FOSS organizations might create would be the equivalent to a University 'chair', a position paid for by an endowment to the organization, to encourage some expert in the chair's area of interest in working full time on that.<p>NetApp supported a group at UMich for a long time who were making the NFS drivers in Linux better and Trond Myklebust who was the kernel gatekeeper. Sort of a public/private partnership. That effort was working because everything needed to succeed was pretty much available (docs, sources, examples, etc).<p>I had a marketing VP at S3 (back when they were making graphics chips and not an IP holding company) tell me that they didn't release documentation because they didn't know if they were violating someones patent and this way even if they were the patent holder didn't know either, it was better for everyone.<p>Now later events have born out the notion that patents are the center of the dispute here, between the SGI patents, the Microsoft patents, the 3dfx and nVidia patents, and various other players, clearly that has had a tremendous chilling effect on open communication.<p>Of course Voodoo graphics were introduced in 1996, so in 2016 3D video card patents start expiring and by 2020 most of the DirectX 9 pipeline's concepts will be public domain.

The point of it isn't to boost your brand so much as it is to suppress your opponent's.<p>However, it alienates the undecided. Mudslinging works best when targeted to base voter blocs. We rarely see it in product advertising, though, because of this fear of alienation. It takes a very well-put-together campaign to attack your competition without giving them too much exposure. The last effective one in recent memory is probably Mac vs. PC, and that focused on targeting the frustrations of current PC users. Often you see it set up in that David vs. Goliath light, which is what I think Freshdesk is trying to do here.<p>This however, isn't marketing. Or, at least, didn't start that way. It started with what you said: pointless personal bickering. There's no reason for it and Zendesk should probably have never have brought up Freshdesk in the first place, negative comments or not.

I absolutely love the way each tab in Chrome is its own separate process. Why doesn't Firefox follow their lead?<p>Many people report the opposite, that Chrome does poorly with hundreds of tabs. The reason is that there is a tradeoff: Running tabs in separate processes as Chrome does takes more memory, but it does help with responsiveness. So whether Firefox or Chrome ends up 'faster' really depends on the number of tabs (and which web pages they are on), and how much memory you have. There is no perfect approach that is fast on everything.",1323034068

It's especially tricky in rural areas where patients return home and can not easily be monitored by healthcare workers.<p>If patients don't comply not only are their chances of successful treatment dramatically reduced but they increase the risk of drug-resistant disease strains like XDR-TB of emerging.<p>So something like Mediminder, if widely adopted, has the potential to save many lives and in one small but important way help developing countries get a handle on some of their most devastating diseases.",1323032931

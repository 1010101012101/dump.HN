1737931,comment,1597765,1685327,0,0,fexl,,,"The Fexl interpreter is simple, elegant, and fast.  The core ""reduce"" routine runs about 43.5 million cycles per second on a simple infinite loop.  If I set max_cycles to a billion it stops after about 23 seconds.<p>To test it with something more real, I wrote the ""cat"" program in Fexl as follows:<p><pre><code>  \cat = (get_char \ch eq EOF ch I; put_char ch cat)
</code></pre>
Then I pumped 30MB of data into it, which took about 42 seconds:<p><pre><code>  time (head -c 30000000 /dev/zero | fexl_cat >/dev/null)
</code></pre>
Of course that's a lot slower that pushing the data through the Unix cat program, which only takes about 0.14 seconds:<p><pre><code>  time (head -c 30000000 /dev/zero | cat >/dev/null)
</code></pre>
But think about all the gyrations happening here:<p><pre><code>  \cat = (get_char \ch eq EOF ch I; put_char ch cat)
</code></pre>
That is translated into the closed (variable-free) form:<p><pre><code>  (Y (S (C get_char) (S (C (S (S (eq EOF) (C I))))
  (S (C (S put_char)) C))))
</code></pre>
Then that runs like the wind, applying combinator rules such as these many millions of times:<p><pre><code>  C x y = x
  S x y z = x z (y z)
  I x = x
  Y x = x (Y x)
</code></pre>
Not to mention that get_char and put_char are handling and building characters one at a time, and the ""eq"" function runs as a combinator as well.<p>By the way it is quite trivial to add new combinators written in C.  For example, the fabled Y combinator is defined in a single file ""type_Y.c"" as follows:<p><pre><code>  #include ""node.h""
  #include ""type_Y.h""

  /*
  Fixpoint function (Y combinator):  (Y f) = (f (Y f))
  */
  static void step(void)
      { 
      int f1 = pop();
      if (!f1) return;

      set_pair(f1, R(f1), P(L(f1),R(f1)));
      } 

  int type_Y(void)
      { 
      static int node = 0;
      if (node == 0) node = new_combinator(step);
      return node;
      } 
</code></pre>
The type_Y.h file just says:<p><pre><code>  extern int type_Y(void);</code></pre>",1285721959

1737925,comment,1737460,1737559,0,0,aik,,,"I agree with you mostly.<p>On point 1:  I don't think there is much that is more important than personalized time.  I don't think 2 minutes of 1-on-1 time a day is ideal, though it's 100x better than what we have now.  Something better may be if each week a teacher spends 10-15 minutes of quality time with each student, rotating who to spend time with from week to week.  Still, naturally we need to try to have less students per classroom.<p>On point 3:  Ideally there would be more autonomy, though as a first step to be significantly more successful, some slight bending of rules would do mounds.<p>On your conclusion and mine:  I believe a major re-education of teachers would solve a lot of the issues.  Most teachers think their main job is transferring knowledge in whatever subject they teach.  However, in today's world where practically all knowledge is freely available, that job has been mostly taken care of.  I believe a teacher's role is being a mentor for each student - assisting each student in discovering the world and their respective subject, inspiring them, freeing their minds, passing on curiosity and intrigue.",1285721818

1737892,comment,1734916,1737047,0,0,lsc,,,">Did they actually do something wrong (on purpose?)<p>I personally believe the e-gold guys were working in good faith to produce an alternate currency, one that functioned like cash, but that was backed by actual gold.  However, it is generally agreed that the majority (or at least a significant portion) of the business transacted with e-gold was illegal in nature, and much like cash, once you spend your e-gold, you can't call up the e-gold company and tell them to reverse the transaction.  you have to get the other party to return the money, and much like cash transactions in the real world, that can be quite difficult.   In fact, the anonymous and electronic nature of e-gold made it better suited for many criminal activities (especially fraud)  than cash, as the fraudster never had to actually meet his mark.<p>Obviously, all this caused a lot of complaints.   Add in the fact that the anonymous nature of E-gold meant that most people weren't paying taxes on the transactions in question, and the government was going to step in and shut them down.<p>Now, I'm no lawyer, but I'd bet that if you set up something like e-gold tomorrow and made it non-anonymous, that, by itself, would make the thing largely acceptable.   You would probably need to set yourself up as a bank or something, and you would probably need to set up something to make it easier for your customers to figure the taxes they owe, (and for the IRS to figure the taxes they owe) but I think the big barrier was anonymity.<p>As a secondary step, some sort of dispute resolution protocol like paypal has would probably also help, but I believe that is secondary to the first concern.",1285720723

1737890,comment,1737797,1737797,0,0,mellery451,,,"hoo - boy! here we go with another web framework religion throwdown.<p>Well, here's my quick answer: pick the one you think you can get going most quickly with. It's better to just get something started that does <i>something</i> than to spend 6 weeks configuring the latest/greatest web framework before you can get started actually developing your app.<p>If, on the other hand, you want to use this project as a way to play with some particular framework - well, then you already have your answer: use that one.<p>Don't fret too much about your initial decision. Your app is going to grow/morph over time. At some point, you might ""outgrow"" your initial choice of framework. No worries - by that time, you'll probably have learned a thing or two about what you <i>really</i> want the app to do. A major refactoring phase is an opportunity to change frameworks, and it's not always as painful as it might seem at first.<p>So, yeah - that's a non-committal answer. But, that's because I think the focus should be on getting something running quickly.  If you have the ASP.net stack on your system already set-up and you know how to get started, fire away. If you're starting from a blank slate, then poke around the documentation for some of the major frameworks (rails, django, cake, etc..)...and have a look at the ""quick start"" guides. Pick one that seems to make the most sense to you and that you think you could get up to speed quickly on.<p>Once you picked your framework to start with, head on over to StackOverflow and peruse the latest questions for that framework. It will give you an idea what kind of issues people are dealing with and what kind of help that community can provide. For each framework, there are other more specific forums/communities, but SO offers an easy way to have a look at a cross section of users/issues.<p>good luck!",1285720634

1737855,comment,1736807,1736977,0,0,mjfern,,,"What you're describing here is the notion of activity systems! Michael Porter describes the concept in detail in the article ""What is Strategy,"" Harvard Business Review. The crux of the idea is that the strategic position of a product hinges on a system of activities across a range of areas, from marketing, to product development, to distribution. Activity systems are a source of sustainable competitive advantage because a competitor can imitate one or two activities, but often not the entire system. In other words, a competitor (e.g., RIM) can imitate Apple's hardware or its software, but this is not sufficient. To really compete with Apple, a competitor would need to imitate (and supersede) Apple on a number of fronts: hardware, software, marketing/branding, distribution, logistics, etc. Needless to say, this is quite a challenge!<p>One of the most stark examples is Southwest Airlines. Scheduled passenger air transportation is a highly transparent industry due to the heavy regulation by the U.S. DOT and the FAA. Despite the fact that competitors know the precise activities that Southwest Airline's performs, they have been generally unable to imitate and compete. And there have been a number of attempts by both legacy and start-up carriers.",1285719731

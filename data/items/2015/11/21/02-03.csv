10605321,comment,10604654,10605093,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I suppose it depends on what kind of society you want to live in.  Is a family something that should only be available to those who can afford it?  Should we compare having children with buying a new pair of shoes or having a car?  Or is it something that we want everyone in society to have available to them: for example like quality healthcare or legal assistance?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to pose a rhetorical question.  I think this is literally a choice that societies have to make.  On one extreme, society does not have to cater to anyone.  We could collect no taxes and have no shared services.  We could have no rules about how companies should interact with their employees or society at large.  At the other extreme we could make everything a shared service and have society dictate how people get access to things.<p>Of course neither of these extremes is desirable for most people.  We have to decide where to draw the line and what we think is good for our society.  Your comment seems to imply that the choice in this case is obvious: if you can&#x27;t afford children you shouldn&#x27;t have them.  However, I think you can imagine the suffering that could impose upon people who have little chance of being able to support a family by their own means.<p>Is a child a luxury like new shoes?  Or is something that we want everyone (regardless of class or wealth) to be able to have (understanding that society will have to foot the bill)?<p>Even though I have couched the question in a slightly loaded way, you might be surprised that I am personally torn by this issue and can see huge drawbacks for both approaches.",1448074445

In fact, the only thing the experts can&#x27;t agree on is what&#x27;s causing it[0].<p>Your analysis of the situation -- &quot;Americans have too many toys to be considered poor&quot; -- is staggeringly short-sighted. Rising cost of housing and medical care in the face of stagnating wages is a legitimate concern on many levels and informs the way our government crafts financial policy. It has huge implications across multiple sectors, including and especially the vaunted &quot;tech sector.&quot;<p>What happens when no one can afford to save for college and they incur massive debts? What effect does that have on the housing market, typically considered the bellweather of economic health?<p>What happens when a generation (or more) never gets around to saving for retirement?<p>What happens when a generation can&#x27;t afford healthcare, even when its subsidized by the government?<p>Income inequality is an important conversation to have; I urge you to not be blinded by superficial indicators of wealth. Mainly for your own sake - your retirement account is probably dependent on some crucial policy decisions being made based on this discussion.<p>[0]<a href=""http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/10/09/for-most-wor...</a>",1448074401

If you mean the CS theory that underpins it all, sure - that level of knowledge is absolutely necessary in many cases.  If you mean the designer&#x27;s intent, sure - that can help, but that would certainly take a back seat to the cold hard CS logic of reality.  Also, I wouldn&#x27;t feel a compulsion to extend the poor coding practices of yesteryear that may be found in legacy codebases (hint: I&#x27;m not talking about code, this is a tortured metaphor).<p>> Please don&#x27;t tell me that you would feel the same way if a member of your family...<p>The desire for revenge is derived from a perceived injustice, that is why one seeks revenge against people and not motorboats - motorboats can&#x27;t reason.

BTW, you can&#x27;t have either in a world where there is any amount of free will.  What next?  Is that your recommendation - empathy?  I&#x27;ll save you some trouble and just let you know ahead of time that if somebody is irrational - no amount of reasoning, emotional or logical, will change their position.  That leaves only three courses of action for the self-interested rational being:<p>1) Try reason, if it doesn&#x27;t work then turn to page 2 or 3<p>2) Violence, but it works in only a super narrow band of circumstances<p>3) Attempt to minimize the damage done to you by the emotion driven mob, this might mean fleeing into the wilderness and becoming a hermit... Or promoting the benefits of logical thought in daily exchanges by demonstrating the wealth, happiness and playboy lifestyle that it has brought you.  Either or.<p>One issue that I won&#x27;t compromise on is that of compromise, which is usually where the emotional route leads.  There are plenty of things for which compromise is just fine, but are generally unimportant and not worth the argument, modifications of properties and not attributes (attributes define kindness of objects, properties do not).  Like if you wanted to paint our rocket red (change the color property) that is fine, a compromise of half red vs full red really makes no difference outside of personal aesthetic preference.  If you wanted to replace the engine with a bag of pineapples, well we have a problem - it is no longer a rocket and there is no compromise between fruit and engine that would leave it a rocket.",1448072687

The code has also recently been passed through clang-format, and in general the quality of the codebase appears to be improving as the number of people contributing to it is slowly increasing.<p>A file having multiple copyright notices is actually common practice. It indicates that the code is based on older code, the copyright of which of course belongs to the original author, but that it has been significantly modified by the &quot;new&quot; author.<p>I think it&#x27;s important to note that up until recently this was basically a one-man project. It&#x27;s in the early stages still. drmeister has since gotten some serious help organizing the project, which should (and looking at the issue tracker, I think it will) help a lot to keep the project moving forward in the right direction.<p>The 0.4 release seems to mark a point at which Clasp is usable and major issues with its functionality have been resolved. It&#x27;s not in any way &quot;finished&quot;.<p>If you want to contribute or are just interested in the project I&#x27;d suggest joining #clasp on Freenode (as I did a couple of months ago).

We live in a computational universe, therefore we are living and breathing and interacting with natural (not artificial) intelligence as a function of merely existing.<p>Assuming that by AI, Wolfram is referring to a computational device built by humans, the communication has already happened in the act of designing and constructing the machine. Real communication is over once you flip it on.<p>What Wolfram is proposing is to then run a Wolfram Language interpreter on top of this new machine and use that to communicate, presumably to ask it for the meaning of the universe. Instead of creating a lingua franca between man and machine, this will prove only that the machine can emulate a von Neumann computer and run the Wolfram interpreter on top. You are NOT communicating with the machine at that point, you are communicating with a parser and a nifty collection of mathematical routines.<p>Think of a parrot. You teach it to say &quot;Polly want a cracker!&quot; - and the parrot may even learn a few human words - but are you really communicating? Can the parrot express to you the thrill of flying, can it explain to you what a total mind-fuck it is for it to be stuck in a cage begging for crackers when it should be flying with its flock and living its life? No, the parrot can only ask you for a cracker, just the way you taught it.<p>Man will never have a relationship among equals with a machine, regardless of how much software he pours on top - the machine has a frame of reference that can never be communicated to a human, it&#x27;s different at the electronic level, never mind the symbolic or linguistic. The machine will have a reality so different from that of the human that even if it could communicate something of substance, it would be as futile as asking your parrot to help you with a math problem - the parrot is not stupid, and in fact can do many things you would find highly mathematical, but it cannot help you with your homework because you are in two different mental universes, no human-invented language can bridge them.",1448071283

- Thomas A. Edison<p>Don't wait. The time will never be just right.
- Napoleon Hill<p>We act as though comfort and luxury were the chief requirements of life, when all that we need to make us happy is something to be enthusiastic about.
- Albert Einstein<p>Failure is rarely fatal.
-Seth Godin<p>Eighty percent of success is showing up.
- Woody Allen<p>My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them.
-Richard Branson<p>I find that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have.

16499,comment,16394,16394,0,0,eli,,,"Ok, this is topic I know a little bit about. Here goes...<p>1. Samsung & BlackBerry browsers? That's not a fair comparison at all! Opera Mobile and Nokia's S60 browser are the clear market leaders (and, yes, both of them render full web pages with JavaScript/AJAX as a thumbnail that you can then zoom in on) See: <a href=""http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/"">http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/</a> and <a href=""http://www.s60.com/browser/"">http://www.s60.com/browser/</a> (btw, the S60 browser is open-source and based on webkit). The iPhone browser is <i>supposed</i> to be very good, but no one's really seen it yet. And it took many years of work for Nokia and Opera to get where they are today (Microsoft still isn't there, and they've really been trying).<p>2. Touchscreens. If all you want is a touchscreen, you can pick up, say, the LG Prada phone or the Samsung Ultra Smart F700. They both sport full-screen touchscreens like the iPhone. There are others.<p>3. Mobile fonts: please. Virtually all modern smartphones have nice, antialiased fonts. Take any cheap Windows Mobile phone for example.<p>4. Big Screens: You <i>can</i> get phones with bigger screens than the iPhone. (But until they invent fold-away screens, they're gonna be bulky)<p>5. Mobile interfaces suck. Ok, I'll give you this one. But I've got a bonus anti-feature of the iPhone for the YComb audience: The iPhone is bad news for developers! <a href=""http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/editor-s-corner/2007-01-16"">http://www.fiercedeveloper.com/story/editor-s-corner/2007-01-16</a>

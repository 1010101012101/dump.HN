A friend is working in high end audio, making a ""iphone on steroids"" touch-screen remote for the system. The tablet will have full 3D graphics for an 8"" screen with half the thickness of an iphone. With a tiny folding keyboard, solid state storage, and some sacrifices on batter life for size, hardware designers should be able to put an ultra-ultra-portable on the market within a year or two.",1200032593
97071,comment,96866,97002,0,0,skmurphy,,,"This to me is a much more common path to success. You avoid debt, determine if there is a market, and stay flexible on your objectives. Once you take 500K or more you can become committed to a path of action just because of the funding and not wanting to appear wrong--I must be smart these guys gave me $500K. If you are willing to listen, you can learn much more from 30 prospects than 30 VC interviews. And it's often much easier to talk to 30 prospects (some of whom may even become customers). To me the time to start talking to VC's is when you have clearly identified a market opportunity that will benefit from additional investment because you are consistently exceeding your plans.",1200032083
97070,comment,96866,96866,0,0,skmurphy,,,"For a software startup I don't know that you need a ""lump of cash"" of more than say $5-10K. You don't have that many capital expenditures compared to other industries (e.g. if you are going to design a chip you need at least $1M for the masks and almost that much for the design tools).<p>In my experience, VC's are asking ""do you have customers"" because they want to talk to them and double check that the reasons customers purchased and the benefits that the customers believe that they have gained match what you are telling them.<p>Also, it matters quite a bit if you are profitable in terms of your negotiating position. If you are unprofitable and tell an investor ""we'll be out of money in six months"" guess when the serious negotiations often start?<p>I have never heard of 7 employees being a magic number. Or $1M in revenue.<p>Also, I would gently disagree with your statement:<p>""Investors know that the failure of a startup isn't necessarily because of the idea, but in not having enough capital to keep afloat while figuring out how to make money.""<p>I think investors value demonstrated results (e.g. happy customers) a team that can execute well together, and the possibility that they are investing in acceleration of the business, not salaries for folks still trying to figure out  how to make money.<p>Consulting and working on the product in parallel has been one approach I've taken, another is keeping my day job and working nights and weekends with a partner. I think if you conceptualize the problem as how to raise 500K to $4M you overlooking the most important risk: market risk (is there a market for your product). Most teams don't fail because they can't build what they set out to build in my experience, most fail because there wasn't a market and they were not willing to adapt, refine, and improve the product until they found a market.",1200031769

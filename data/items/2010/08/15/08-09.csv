The fundamental problem with the problem is that it's a relational problem and polymorphism largely solves hierarchical problems. This type of problem also solves easily in prolog. The solution to the problem in java is to create some kind of relation class that abstracts the state of the relationship to between individuals/groups.",1281862706

Could users rent their own access to it? Could they use DDG safely, along with their own servers for hosting their mail, voice, etc.<p>But I don't want those services to be tiered.

1604824,comment,1603392,1603392,0,0,10ren,,,"One of Oracle's selling points for their database was independence over hardware vendors. Java offers the same - although today's hardware is much less diverse.<p>Sun in fact did litigate over Java, as the article offhandedly mentions, though the motivation there was that MS different version was fragmenting the language, and undermining the compatibility of ""write once, run anywhere"".<p>I agree with the article that even a few billion in damages isn't worth it to Oracle. There must be some strategic advantage, quite possibly in some negotiations with Google that we haven't heard about (and perhaps will never hear about).<p>The point made about the mobile revolution is the right kind of path; another revolution in progress is the cloud. There is definite overlap between Google and Oracle in the cloud, with Google's technology expertise, and it being used by the enterprise - that's probably what Oracle hopes to gain.",1281862155

I think the clean, sans-serify, widely spaced design grew to prominence in part as a reaction to busy, link-heavy corporate/portal sites and for a time it looked friendly, clean and simple. Now it's so common it manages to also look generic and corporate. The visual design has also become a bit a bit of a habit, at the expense of usability. It doesn't always work.<p>Compare loopt to, say, Flightcaster. Loopt is clean, good-looking and entirely uninformative. What does Loopt do? Why should you be eager to 'partner with' them? Flightcaster is busy, typographically sinful and yet answers the sort of questions you might have if you've never heard of Flightcaster. And you can try it right there and then.",1281860570

But even with fewer subclasses we still have to define the likes/dislikes of N monsters with N-1 other monsters. Further, every time a new monster is added, N monsters like/dislike logic has to be updated.<p>Maybe we are looking at the system/problem from the wrong perspective?<p>Maybe the likes/dislikes between monsters isn't actually so arbitrary. Perhaps, it is the characteristics of one monster that other monsters don't like or do like. If this is the case (which makes sense as in the real world we judge other things based on characteristics and behavior), then the like/dislike behavior can be encapsulated.<p>Further, using something like Strategy pattern, you can come up with a set of algorithms that define the likes/dislikes between monsters. That way you can compose that specific behavior of a monster at run-time further reducing your class count.",1281859940

I have a life and family in the United States, and a life and family in Greece, and I tend to not like mixing them a lot. Visiting Greece for a weekend feels hugely disrespectful to me--- I tend to visit for a week at the minimum, preferably 2+ weeks. It's a context switch, and I find that short trips fail to fully implement the switch, instead treating it as just another location, like any other location, rather than getting into the local language, mood, culture, etc. Even just linguistically, it takes me at least a week to get comfortable using Greek as an everyday language again. You really need some time to properly switch contexts and treat it as somewhere genuinely different, imo.<p>That, and the jet-setting lifestyle would alienate me from friends and family: if I were the type of person who flew in to Greece for a 3-day weekend, I would no longer be one of them.",1281859738

This must have had a tremendous impact on his health.<p>- It was the mid-80s, you couldn't just Google about Touva and find out about it.<p>- The cold-war was still going on.  And probably USSR was still very much a black-box.<p>- He worked on several government projects (imagine what security clearance he was when he worked on investigating the Challenger explosion), so going to the a country within the USSR was probably a real challenge.<p>Granted he could pull some strings in the government to get a piece of invitation paper, but that's not the point.  Plus after reading about Feynman, he's not the type of people to do something like that just to go to another mysterious country.  He'd find creative ways to do his goal and enjoy the the process as things unfolded.  If you feel disappointed about Feynman coudln't fulfill his goal of reaching Touva, then you have miss the point about the whole story.  Nonetheless, he did get an invitation to go to Touva a few days after he passed away.  So he did succeed after all.<p>And no, there's nothing specific about ""entrepreneurial thoughts"" in the video, so you have had a wrong expectation to begin with.",1281859551

The police are also usually not treated like an invading army, so it's apples for oranges.<p>I'd at least suggest holstering the weapons until they're needed and weighing the probability of encryption against the probability of forceful self-defense, case by case. If for some reason there's reason to believe that the person is working next to both a loaded gun and an encrypted disk, sure, treat it as a hostage situation and call swat or the wiretappers in.

2155239,comment,2153681,2155210,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"As I mentioned, sit-ins are non-violent, <i>disruptive</i> protests designed to raise awareness.<p>This does not mean that any form of disruption is analogous to a sit-in. If you know that you'll be arrested for a DDoS attack then certainly that's a sacrificial act (though to map closely to a sit-in you'd have to announce publicly what you are doing). However, even then that doesn't necessarily account for the damage participating in a DDoS can bring. Sit-ins rarely cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of dollars in business.<p>As it stands the debate is academic and the comparison is irrelevant. To date the number of DDoS attacks that have been carried out in public with full listings of the names and contact information of the participants is precisely zero.<p>You can hide behind a mask, or an IP, and you can throw your packets or your molotov cocktails at those folks you consider ""the bad guys"", securely smug in your knowledge that you're fighting the good fight. But that's an illusion. You're not Ghandi, you're not Rosa Parks. You're just another jerk with an ax to grind who doesn't have the guts to accept any consequences for his actions.<p>The reason sit-ins are lauded and DDoS's are shunned is because people who abuse the disruptive power of a sit-in to fight for worthless causes or their own self interest are simply sent to jail. Whereas most perpetrators of DoS attacks go uncaught.",1296300217
2155238,comment,2154106,2154106,0,0,anonfoobar,,,"The vesting over 4 years is long by industry standards; understandable though if the buyer really wants to keep the founders on board. If you lose key people after acquisition, you might as well not have bought the company. I suspect the buyer got burnt on this in the past, and now compensates with very long vesting periods.<p>Creating an impression that ""the first offer is the final offer"" can safely be assumed to be negotiation tactics. This is what they are paid for; the people you're talking to do this sort of negotiation all the time. You are fencing with someone that has practiced this for years, and they have much less to lose than you. Do not assume malice, just assume that their job is to get a good deal for their employer.<p>Be frank: Tell them what you think the value of the company actually is. An M&A deal is like getting married: If you don't feel that it's the happiest day of your life when you sign your company over, you probably shouldn't do it. A little bit of cold feet is to be expected, but generally you should -not- enter a deal where you have a bitter taste in your mouth. That would do neither you (nor the potential buyer) any good.<p>Get yourself advisors (experienced ones, preferably); but be careful: Keep their incentive structure in mind. Some have a lot less to lose than you (e.g. if the deal breaks apart, they lose a couple of hours of work), but can often gain much more from risk-taking (as they usually want a percentage of the proceeds).<p>Your impression that a lot of advisors seem like they have something to sell to you is correct, because they do. Finding one that you deem trustworthy is important; personal connections are usually more helpful than shopping around.<p>It is not unheard of to not get the LOI before the basic terms are agreed upon. The buyer wants to avoid giving you something in writing that you could use to shop around.<p>Good luck !",1296300123

The Lua environment on Windows is quite a bit better than the environment on Ubuntu.

And don't be afraid to call a bunch of people you've never talked to in a while: it's just laziness and the disconnectedness of modern life, they're still your friends.<p>Don't stay up late by yourself, sleep immediately or go somewhere where you /aren't alone/.",1279234792

1519559,comment,1516168,1518323,0,0,jmcentire,,,"Interestingly enough, 10 point ""employees"" can and do have trouble differentiating themselves.  MIT Ph.D. admission, for instance, is rather selective.  There is much research available demonstrating that there is a huge qualitative difference between consummate achievers and great minds.  Unfortunately, most businesses and schools have far too many applications for employment and need some easy metric to reduce the set to something approachable.  I'm not suggesting a blind hire of the top guy.  I'm trying to provide a more relevant metric than current exists.  Any other system I've seen in play is easy to game -- or hard to game, but in gaming it, you're becoming the opposite of what the company/school is seeking.<p>Further, ""what's in it for the employee"" doesn't enter into it.  I could easily say: famousactress is rated as 8.34 for her dramatic performances but only at 5.21 in comedic roles.  That has nothing to do with your willing participation.  I agree that it's depressing to be considered sub-par.  But, there are so many people trying desperately to stand out that they're losing their way.<p>Google can't hire the right sort of people because every metric they have attempted to date has resulted in honest, dependable, clean-cut, recently-shaven, knowledgeable CS graduates from top universities.  Sadly, they're trying to expand a business built (like so many other startups) by the ideas of college drop-outs (or similar), who were too busy doing something interesting to go to class and get good grades.  Those interesting things aren't bragging rights (level 80 character in each class and each faction on WoW appears on very few resumes).<p>If I attach my HN information, you might disagree with my positions and opinions.  I'd miss out on the job based upon personal bias -- maybe I should.  But, you'll notice my karma here is _very_ low.  I suppose that seems justified since you're not on board with this concept.  But, is it?  Reddit is commonly gamed.  If I had an outrageous karma score, would you think highly of me or consider me a karma whore?<p>Well, you might say, you'd simply read my posts.  Great!  Now, consider you have a highly coveted position and 10,000 applicants.  You can only read the posts of about 20 applicants.  Do you take the top 20 highest scores?  What if the 21st highest was actually the best fit?  Well, then you blame your metric.  The reason you blame your metric is because people will game their karma scores to reduce their competition to only 20 other people who were busily whoring karma and not building necessary job skills.  At the same time, you can't deal with 10,000 resumes.  You need a metric that's not easily gamed and that's as representative as possible of an individual's skills.<p>Just like I can tag you in a photo on Facebook without your consent, this site would allow me to rate your skills as an actress and as a programmer.  My opinion of your acting skill is pretty much worthless (whether it's good or bad); my opinion of your programming skill is more significant -- but I'm not going to single-handedly make you or break you.",1279234767

Given that they've been a part of X Windows window managers for a couple of decades, it's just astonishing that they've never made an appearance as a standard feature of other windowing systems.<p>This, of course, isn't a new feature in GNOME 3, and so I guess it's not really relevant, but I just felt like ranting about the one thing that I think the Linux desktop has always had such a clear lead on, and that until you've used it you don't even know how much it sucks to not have it.",1279234598
1519551,comment,1519370,1519370,0,0,BobbyH,,,"What you're talking about is called suicidal ideation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicidal_ideation</a>. (Google those keywords to learn more.)<p>I have dealt with this issue for 20 years. The first 10 years, I thought I was going to die. But I've learned to lower my suicidal ideation levels tremendously by trial and error.<p>It was reassuring for me to learn from a psychologist friend that (A) suicidal ideation is the ""lowest rung on the ladder of risk"", so to speak, in terms of the risk of actually killing yourself. The next rungs on the ladder are: (B) deciding to kill yourself, (C) deciding when to kill yourself, and (D) deciding how to kill yourself. With that said, if you go up a rung, you're in trouble and need to escalate your remedies.<p>In my experience, if you are sure you are not capable of committing suicide and/or do not want to, it's possible to live a long time with suicidal ideation, although it sucks.<p>Here are some tips:<p>* Stop drinking if you lose control of yourself while drunk, especially if you're a sad drunk. Or at least limit the number of drinks you consume.<p>* Suicidal ideation is a symptom of depression, which is an mechanism that evolved to tell us that our body/mind is thinking: ""I don't like something about your life and you need to change it."" Focus on changing those somethings.<p>* You are allowed to have ""bad thoughts"" like ""I am so depressed"". However, you cannot allow yourself to have ""bad thoughts about bad thoughts"" or what I call ""meta thoughts"". In other words, you can't think ""I am so depressed that I'm still depressed."" Meta thoughts lead to bad thought spirals which increases suicidal ideation.<p>* Exercise does not ameliorate this condition for me, but it may for you, try it?<p>* Reduce the amount of stress in your life. This definitely contributes to depression. But really, you need to figure out why your body/mind is rebelling against you. If you're trapped in a bad job/relationship, you need to fix that.<p>* Watch this video to learn about the three levels of happiness: <a href=""http://blog.sokanu.com/building-a-happiness-framework-in-your-compan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.sokanu.com/building-a-happiness-framework-in-you...</a><p>* Like me, you probably have a very low positive affect (don't smile a lot naturally, aren't bubbly/happy). Focus on spending as much time in Flow (the second level) as possible: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIeFJCqsPs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXIeFJCqsPs</a><p>Good luck!",1279234555

1519423,comment,1516343,1516961,0,0,Goladus,,,"I have a story about this, too.<p>I bought a wheel from a bike store without knowing anything about bike wheels or bike stores.  The wheel collapsed on me 3 weeks later, I fell into traffic and a car ran over me, crushing my chest.  I'm now rotting in a graveyard paying back my 'technical debt'.<p>Ok that's just a story.  Here's an anecdote:<p>I spent the last 3 weeks, which I could have spent doing things far more interesting and productive, rebuilding Perl modules because so many perl programmers couldn't be fucked to write portable code and our dependencies appear to number 300 or more.  (Nobody actually kept track, of course)<p>For example, somebody's script, somewhere, uses Array::Compare.  It's a tiny module that compares arrays (length, index of different elements, etc.), which is like a first year computer science project.  Version 1.18 is 500 lines (including docs+comments) and has one dependency: Carp, a core module.  Version 2.01 of Array::Compare is 465 lines (including docs+comments) and requires <i>Moose</i> which itself has 23 other dependencies many of which are not core modules and some require compilation.  If Array::Compare was part of a standard library, one that ships with the standard Perl distribution, this wouldn't have been a problem.  It wouldn't use Moose unless Moose was also part of the core dist, at which point it wouldn't be a problem unless maybe I was compiling everything from sratch, which I'm not.<p>So I have to downrev that module and use the old version, or else introduce another new significant dependency (which did not compile successfully on my first couple attempts) or else track down the script and eliminate the dependency and check to see if the author is in punching distance.<p>That's just one example.  There were also mismatched compiler flags, modules that didn't install on some days because tests required connections to webservers that were returning 500 errors-- all the kinds of minor problems that aren't that big of a deal when you are one developer installing only the modules you need to solve your immediate problem, but turn into a huge mess when there are 300+ of them.<p>That's technical debt coming due.  (And I'm certainly not paying back all of it, I'm not compiling Perl from scratch I'm not manually finding every scrap of perl code on our systems to see which modules they still really need, etc.)",1279231832

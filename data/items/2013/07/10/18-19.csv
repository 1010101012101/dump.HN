(There&#x27;s more to it than just &amp; and &lt;. Without looking it up, do you know what a Billion Laughs is, and why it&#x27;s related to entities?) What&#x27;s in a DTD? Do you understand XML namespaces properly? (e.g., in the tag <x:test xmlns:x=&quot;<a href=""http://blah.com/ns1&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blah.com/ns1&quot;</a> att=&quot;1&quot;/>, what namespace is &quot;att&quot; in? What, <i>exactly</i>, does the <a href=""http://blah.com/ns1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blah.com/ns1</a> mean? How does it relate to blah.com or the content at <a href=""http://blah.com/ns1?"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blah.com/ns1?</a>) Do you have an understanding of the various schema languages? Do you understand how encodings interact with XML? Are you familiar with the terminology (e.g., can you <i>precisely</i> answer &quot;What is CDATA?&quot;, with some idea of where in the XML grammar it appears and what characters are and are not allowed)? Do you know what a processing instruction is? What is the correct way to embed binary data in XML?<p>BTW, the answer is generally no. &quot;Everybody&quot; understands a subset of XML with balanced tags and simple attributes, but I&#x27;d guess single-digit percentages of the people who have &quot;XML&quot; on their resume really <i>know</i> XML, rather than the simple subset. Fortunately, as an interchange format, since nobody understands XML, nobody uses it to its full capacity, those few who try use it incorrectly, and it turns out there isn&#x27;t a heck of a lot of reason to actually know the full scope of XML, since in general you&#x27;re unlikely to encounter correct advanced XML anyhow. You can easily go an entire career without ever seeing the advanced features used <i>correctly</i>. Actually knowing XML can be almost end up being an impediment, you&#x27;re almost better off having a fuzzy understanding so that when you encounter some developer&#x27;s weird half-assed dialect, you&#x27;re less shocked and just get on with it.<p>(I am aware that some of my example questions there are themselves based on false premises.

Instead of actually researching your niche and making a choice about what content is most important to solve your customers&#x27; problems and your own goals and what content gets priority on a page, they take the lazy way out and order the designer to fit everything on the screen.<p>Most decent web developers who place a premium on UX will not usually suggest a carousel as the best way to display some content on the screen, and they may fight those decisions as best as they can, but at the end of the day the people who pay the bills will make these decisions.",1373482695

6021994,comment,6020969,6020969,1,0,bigbento,,,"Over the past few years, I worked on a few versions of this as a side project. The last iteration didn&#x27;t do the backup itself--it connected with your Dropbox, sync&#x27;d the raw images, and processed them at a preset +-2 EV, and 3 color temperatures. The image results were good, but honestly I never found it particularly compelling.<p>In any case, building this sort of thing is a pain. The most obvious problem is the size of the images. Glacier is an interesting backup solution, and had just come out around the time I decided to stop working on my app. A less obvious problem is raw conversion. All the best converters are proprietary, meaning that I had to piggy back off the Mac OS converter engines. Again, I never got to the point where I felt the product was worth the trouble of buying racking up a Mac Mini to run a little market test. Maybe I&#x27;m wrong.<p>I had a (frankly somewhat scattered) draft of a post mortem written, and since it seems like there&#x27;s some interest in this subject, I posted it: <a href=""http://scraps.bigbento.com/2013/05/30/hiatus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scraps.bigbento.com/2013/05/30/hiatus.html</a>",1373482619

Not when the founders leave, and the growth halts.<p>So yes, a new stock market, not bound to the financial gaming house, is needed to supply capital to growing companies.<p>It wont be kickstarter.

My experience has been that although it sounds great to be &quot;super&quot; flexible, it&#x27;s really hard to run a company that way.

Mentioning that a power is contained within a clause of the Telecommunications Act doesn&#x27;t really mean much. All 594 subsections need to be read in conjunction with each other before an accurate interpretation can be made. I&#x27;ve had a quick read through and I can&#x27;t really see how a broad enough construal of Part 13 is possible for anything you&#x27;re saying to happen. It&#x27;s going to turn on whether the government believes whether the High Court will interpret what you&#x27;re describing as &#x27;reasonable&#x27; even though the Act repeatedly emphasises that confidentiality should be paramount. We&#x27;ve got some silly people in power but they&#x27;re not that dumb.<p>I do not understand how councils are not already part of the &#x27;public revenue&#x27;, maybe there is case law on this that I am unaware of?<p>The explanatory memorandum attached to the referendum explicitly states that the Federal government will have no legal influence over local councils. It also mentions that the referendum is for no other purpose than to grant the council money. As soon as any evidence of what you&#x27;ve described crops up they&#x27;re going to get their asses handed to them in court as they&#x27;re acting against their own explicit intention. I can&#x27;t see the loophole you do at all.<p>I&#x27;ve spent the last 25 minutes or so going through the Telecommunications Act and it is an absolute shambles when read in context. As I said in another post, there are far simpler ways for the Commonwealth to claim a legal right to monitor us.<p>If the Australian government wanted to monitor our metadata, or conduct any other sort of surveillance for that matter, they&#x27;d probably just do it and then claim external affairs once they&#x27;re caught. It&#x27;s far simpler and more effective than to try to engineer a legal loophole like you&#x27;re describing.

They don&#x27;t really have that many color pixels on their CCDs. CCDs are actually black-and-white and use colored stripes to see color.

Think it through a bit - what&#x27;s more likely to make you more depressed? A) being told you&#x27;re so screwed up you need professional help so jot down the number of a suicide hotline and a qualified therapist or B) being treated as an equal that doesn&#x27;t need coddling and given real world advice that might actually help yourself and others and maybe even be fun? Think about that and related ideas... how many people do you think jumped off the golden gate bridge because some guy wasn&#x27;t sufficiently sensitive on some internet forum? how many people end up with gradually increasing symptoms of depression because of this cultural inclination to distance ourselves and focus on the negativity until we&#x27;ve had enough &quot;therapy&quot;, when often the best solution is to get out of bed, break the cycle and let ourselves heal in peace? That can be the hardest thing in the world, but engaging in life is really the best solution. Do you really think that IF OP needs therapy or an emergency hotline, that the best solution is to get that advice from some random strange on HN?<p>OP is obviously collected and intelligent enough to write a coherent post on HN about this. I gave direct, actionable advice and I&#x27;m saying that OP is a smart, capable person with the ability to do good in the world who doesn&#x27;t need to be coddled like a 12 year old. How likely is it that when one is asking HN for advice, one hasn&#x27;t heard this same boilerplate drivel? I took time out of my day to think out both of these posts and try to find something original. OP has probably been trying to deal with this many different ways and maybe my way isn&#x27;t his way, but it&#x27;s more likely to be helpful than some crap you can find by googling depression for 5 minutes. I chose to get involved for that reason and I&#x27;m here participating in the thread for followup if it resonated with OP. The therapy and emergency hotline approach is obnoxiously bad - great advice if your employee comes to you and you want to avoid legal entanglement, not particularly good in reality... if you&#x27;re at the point of posting on HN, you probably have thought about going to a therapist right? So are you really helping or hurting by giving that advice, probably for the 100th time?<p>&quot;man up&quot; means acting according to typical masculine values of practicality and altruism : get out of bed, go find someone with real life and death problems and help them. It means just think about the next hour or the next minute and do something helpful for other human beings. This builds a support network, fires the social parts of the brain, level sets how bad things can get in the world and how much one smart guy can actually matter and gives a direct resource (boys and girls club) to follow up.<p>... also I explicitly discussed the intellectual, emotional and physical aspects of depression in there... it&#x27;s a self reinforcing loop.",1373481789

Internet connection speeds are fast, smartphones have snappy native apps, 3G is everywhere -- so you can order groceries on the ride home. You can quickly download 100 images of products on the bus ride home and pick the ones you want (for example).<p>-- For Instacart, processing those orders at scale is also easier than ever. EC2 instances are cheap and easily provisioned, payment processing is easier thanks to a bevy of services, and online use of credit cards doesn&#x27;t have the riskiness and stigma associated with it in the 90s.<p>-- For the shopper going out to buy groceries, communication is easier than the 90s. With broadband and smartphones, they can send updates back to Instacart servers faster and have them processed automatically (as opposed to the 90s, where a cellphone call would have information transmitted by voice, which would have to be processed by a human). Smartphones alone enable a larger volume of information to be communicated back to Instacart, and have it be as simple as the shopper checking off items purchased or scratching off items not available.<p>-- For Instacart again, dynamic routing, inventory updates, and scheduling are much easier (in theory) because of the timely updates from shoppers, as well as the enormous amount of computing power available. Couple that with GPS tracking and you enable some sort of accountability for the shoppers, as well as a better customer experience for the user (&quot;your shopper is 3 minutes away, on Van Ness...&quot;)<p>It&#x27;s similar to how UPS revolutionized package shipping with point-by-point delivery updates.<p>That said, as a former Instacart patron, I feel Instacart has a long way to go before it&#x27;s as entrenched as Amazon.",1373481716

A local cop probably just stood behind one of the pilots while they flew over the property and spotted the cows.<p>Also: to somebody who didn&#x27;t grow up in this area, that probably sounds really silly...but keep in mind that cows are worth a couple of thousand dollars each.  So you&#x27;re talking, low end, about $12,000 worth of property that they won&#x27;t return.  That&#x27;s like having a stolen car.<p>--<p>I think something like this (flying a UAV, since CBP doesn&#x27;t actually fly drones) should require a search warrant, but this is a totally reasonable use of resources IMHO.<p>Don&#x27;t throw the baby out with the bathwater, I guess.<p>[1]: They&#x27;d probably give a tour to anybody that asked, actually.  Grand Forks is home to one of the biggest and best Aviation and Aerospace engineering schools in the world[2], and it would surprise me if there wasn&#x27;t a relationship between the air force base there, and the school.

It seems that was and is acceptable to the law and the world at large. In fact, before iBooks, publishers were already selling their books as stand alone apps under this model.  When Apple created iBooks, they continued this existing model in their newly created ebook marketplace  that seems entirely natural and unprovocative.

6021770,comment,6020647,6021103,11,0,jmj42,,,"> I think this addresses the challenge of the general solicitation rule (finding the startups) without the negative of creating a bunch of unvetted startups advertising for dollars.<p>Not really.  We, here on HN, tend to frame things around tech startups, but there&#x27;s a larger world out there that incubators don&#x27;t (and often can&#x27;t) address.  Consider this (real life) example:<p>Recently a local pub came up for sale.  The asking price was $200,000.  The purchase would include all current equipment and supplies, existing vendor contracts (subject to state transferability rules on the alcohol contracts), and local liquor license (the state license isn&#x27;t transferable).  It also included the building which housed 3 occupied (at the time) apartments.<p>The question, of course, is how to raise the $200K.  Standard business loans were out (not an established business).  There&#x27;s SBA, but the loan amount we were looking for was a bit high for SBA.  Friends and family, of course, but we wouldn&#x27;t even come close.<p>In the end, we had to pass (though funding was only a  part of the decision to pass).  Here&#x27;s kicker:  If we could have spread the net wider, we may have had a chance to raise the money (with less effort), and been able to go ahead with the purchase.<p>While this is one story, I see these kinds of things al the time.  A few years back, a founder looking to start a paintball facility got nailed by this (he was advertising the investment opportunity).  It ended up shutting down the project.<p>The point is, outside of the technology world, getting investment funding for small businesses is very hard.  This rule change makes it much easier.",1373480272

No, there&#x27;s not a standard way to map these onto a cell scale coordinate system easily. When you are talking about cell-level anatomy, you can almost think of things as being slightly disordered, with the disorder increasing the smaller in scale you go. Most tissues have constant turnover of cells, further complicating the concept of a coordinate system. Some examples where there is a consistent (almost) unchanging anatomy would be in neurons and stem cell germ layers.For germ layers, simple 3D coordinates would work.

Startup investments are <i>hugely</i> speculative, the vast majority turn a lot of cash into nothing.  The public is risk adverse; look at the last financial downturn, there is still a subset of people pushing legislated guaranteed stock market returns because they don&#x27;t understand the risk/return relationship.  As soon as a few people lose all their money, this whole scheme is going to violently implode.<p>Consider this, the 10-year early stage VC performance was 3.9% [1], with late stage and expansion focused funds at 9.3%.  Average VC returns were 6.1%.  By comparison, the DJIA returned 8.6%, the NASDAQ returned 10.3%, and the S&P 500 returned 8%.  Private, non-qualified investors are going to get slaughtered.  VCs are professional investors and their overall industry returns are awful.  In addition, private investors have no connections.  Those returns include VC&#x27;s that now routinely liquidate failing companies to other portfolio companies and their LP&#x27;s as &quot;talent acquisitions&quot;, where they recover their investment through their liquidation preference; Joe six-pack won&#x27;t be able to do that, he will just lose all his money.<p>The average mutual fund generates below market returns in the long run.  If the average fund manager, a professional that spends 100% of their time trying to find strong opportunities for investment can&#x27;t consistently generate excess returns, does anybody actually believe that the public will be able to?  This is only compounded by the extreme risk and volatility of startup investing.  Maybe you hand-wave this off, and say the average fund manager is stupid, and maybe they are, but I&#x27;d bet they are nowhere near as stupid as the average member of the general public, just go read some YouTube comments.<p>My bet is that late-stage and expansion deals still go to the VC crowd because they can bring mountains of cash, fast, with connections.  The early-stage funding, with the 3.9% long-term returns will go to the public, with even lower than historic returns.

As we&#x27;ve seen in many other mid-level management scandals, including the IRS, for the guy getting screwed it doesn&#x27;t make much difference whether it&#x27;s the president or some nameless bureaucrat being paid off by the mob who&#x27;s doing it.

First, lots of teenagers and young people are gang members, and gangs have major presences in inner-city schools, so even a &quot;gang-related murder&quot; isn&#x27;t like some mobster getting killed, but something that hits really close to home in the community. Second, this activity is very geographically segregated, which makes particular neighborhoods seem more like war zones. Third, even a few innocent bystanders getting caught in the cross-fire can have a chilling effect on the community. In Chicago this year, a kid who sang at Obama&#x27;s inauguration was gunned down in gang-related cross-fire. Just one kid in a city of 2.7 million people, but it still had a tremendous effect on the community.<p>The trend in America is definitely downward--murder counts in LA county and NYC are about a fifth of what they were in the early 1990&#x27;s, but they are still 4x higher than London&#x27;s (greater London is roughly similar in population to LA county and NYC). And the militarization of the U.S. police didn&#x27;t happen overnight. It happened in the 1970&#x27;s-1990&#x27;s when crime rates in U.S. cities skyrocketed.

All numbers, symbols are also same when you are in English typing mode.<p>Basically no additional key in there compared to QWERTY.<p>Is that complex and hard learning type in Hangul? Nope. Maybe &#x27;Korean&#x27; is complex to learn, but &#x27;Hangul&#x27; - I mean, script? character composition system? sort of that - is quite simple.[2]<p>Actually It&#x27;s capable of implement more efficient input layout than English especially more restricted environment.

6021635,comment,6020334,6020334,44,0,javajosh,,,"Reading this article it suddenly became clear: FISA <i>is</i> an Executive Branch agency that defends executive actions, much like the DoJ. In other words, it <i>is</i> the DoJ. When it (at least) comes to the 4th Amendment, the executive branch has manipulated Section 215 of the Patriot managed to totally unchain itself from the Constitution and do whatever it wants, in secret, from both the public and the other branches of government.<p>The magnitude of this is stunning. Historically, the executive has unchained itself for brief periods for specific issues. I do not know of any attempt to unchain itself in perpetuity, and in secret.<p>The fact that anyone finds it the least defensible is even more stunning. I mean, even if you are for mass surveillance (and there are many who legitimately feel that way) surely you must be concerned that it was done without your knowledge or consent.<p>There are two paths to solving this problem, both of which result in striking down Section 215 of the Patriot Act: a court challenge (which the EFF is spear-heading) and an act of Congress (which is very unlikely given the lack of public awareness and uproar).<p>Personally, I would like to see an additional censure on Obama and all other executive, legislative, and judicia officials who abrogated their duty to protect the Constitution of the United States of America. It needs to be our harshest censure, to send a message to future administrations that secret coups will not be tolerated.",1373479236

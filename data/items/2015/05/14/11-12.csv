9544537,comment,9543005,9544415,0,0,tankenmate,,,"As an old joke (a ha-ha only serious joke) goes, closures are a poor man&#x27;s object orientation, and object orientation is a poor man&#x27;s closure. Going on the list of languages you have above I&#x27;ll take it from the object orientation side of the argument. Object orientation works by binding functions to data; the data is persistent for this instance of the object (in the sense that the data remains available as long as the object does) and can be manipulated by the functions bound to that data. Closures on the other hand bind data to functions; so the function is always callable but the data is bound to this instance of the function. So you can have many instances of a function each with it&#x27;s own data bound to it. In most languages that support closures functions are considered a &quot;first class&quot; data type; i.e. individual functions (and the data bound to them) can be passed just like variables (sometimes with caveats depending on the implementation). Typically this comes hand in hand with &quot;anonymous&quot; functions; functions that don&#x27;t have an entry in the symbol table, i.e. they don&#x27;t have a name in the function / object namespace.<p>If you truly want to understand <i>how</i> it works then you&#x27;d probably want to write a compiler that supports closures; you&#x27;d then need to cover issues like how to allocate functions on the heap, the difference between locally allocated (typically on the stack) data bound to functions and globally allocated (typically on the heap) data bound to functions.<p>The second part to closures is understanding the theory, or the <i>why</i> and the high level functionality that it enables, such as callbacks with state or interactions with the likes of recursive (y-combinator like) functions.<p>EDIT: minor grammar fix",1431604578

9544527,comment,9543144,9544390,0,0,hga,,,"MIT doesn&#x27;t really have &quot;tough&quot; grading per se, it has a lot of tough courses that are graded by mastery of the material.  If you&#x27;ve chosen an appropriate major for yourself, you&#x27;ll be getting mostly As and Bs.  This eliminates dire competitive stresses that prompt sabotage in other schools, and encourages helping out each other.  There&#x27;s also a committee watching out for abuses by professors that would go so far as taking a class away from one if he thought there was cheating and decided to punitively grade as a result (although they&#x27;re more focused on demanding too much, e.g. too lengthy finals, or otherwise too much required stuff at the end of term).<p>For freshman, it was graded pass-fail for the first year when I attended back in the &#x27;80s, now just for the first semester; that&#x27;s more to ease the transition than anything else, and &quot;hidden&quot;, unofficial grades are kept in case you need them for e.g. medical school applications.  And the reported GPAs treat an A as 5.0.<p>Some figures for applications, as of some years ago, I think more people are applying now: 13,000 applications, but MIT has a high bar in terms of being able to do the general requirements of a semester of math past the AP Calculus BC sequence, one term each of mechanics and E&M calculus based physics, and other stuff like chemistry and a lab.

Lots of people say it&#x27;s so much fun.<p>I first learned a very modest bit of javascript a few years ago, I learn more when I need it, more recently I got about halfway through O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Learning Javascript&quot; but am now stopped dead because I regard it as so tedious and dull.<p>Mind you I am not by any means a language zealot.  If you enjoy javascript then more power to you.<p>But I myself would rather chew my own foot off than actually get paid to write javascript code.  Unfortunately I am concerned I may not have much choice.<p>Is there way you can convince me that javascript can actually be fun and interesting to me?<p>What I regard as fun is sweating over how to reduce cache misses in my iOS conway&#x27;s game of life implementation, Warp Life.  I once write an AES hard drive encryptor that ran entirely onboard the Oxford OXFW911 Firewire/IDE bridge chip.  It had a 49 MHz ARM7TDMI CPU, 64 kB of 16-bit flash with a five-cycle read time, and 1800 bytes of 32-bit ram with a one cycle read time.<p>FireWire Encrypt was a tough project but I had a grand old time working on it.<p>My gripe with javascript is that it is simply not possible for me to use it to solve the problems that interest me.",1431603806

Now let’s come to the other question about how do you get to the apps that are useful? The ones you see on high on the list are usually promoted up there, they may be good but you can’t say there isn’t anything better. If people are adding thousands of apps everyday then obviously they are improving the experience.\nThere could be an app with lesser bugs than a popular one, or a free substitute to a paid one, but how do you discover them? A little research on human behavior tells us that we don’t trust anything new until it has been used by someone we trust, and the same goes with technology and us. We follow experts on Youtube, twitter, Facebook, Mashable, Tumblr, Pinterest to source information or content on various topics. Zappka is one stop, exclusively for apps. \nWith Zappka, anyone can create an appstore for others to follow. You can follow experts from any field and see the apps they use/recommend. It’s an app that lets you find great apps, curated by intelligent human instinct. App bloggers and critics can organize their content on a platform specially customized for them. They can get serious traction, and build a reputation by recommending new and interesting apps on their appstores. The can also monetize their content as Zappka will share the revenue earned, per download from the store. The app opens the door for a new app career that ensures quality content and apps for everyone.\n Now if, you need an app for a purpose, you just need to find the right appstore.

The change isn&#x27;t quantifiable in numbers. It will most likely not change the bottom line of the company.<p>But what it does do, is communicate that Facebook cares about visual design craft.

Get some help<p>When your livelihood is on the line, I’d always recommend engaging professional help.<p>A good technology lawyer will help you achieve your outcomes by drafting the right contractual terms and helping you work through edge cases.<p>For example, do you want to own any improvements that you make to your framework during the course of the engagement, which at this point are purely for this client but could be used for other clients later?<p>In my experience, the answer is probably &quot;yes&quot;.<p>This is at odds with many standard form or precedent contracts, which say all the developed software belongs to client. Sometimes they include an exception that you can keep ownership of your &#x27;pre-existing&#x27; software. Pre-existing software is usually defined as software that exists at the time you sign the contract. Under a contract like this, any code that you produce after signature will belong to the client, even that code is an improvement to your general framework.<p>3. Insist on understanding<p>Sometimes lawyers will use terms of art, such as &#x27;Background, Foreground and Sideground IP&#x27;.<p>These phrases can be useful shortcuts. They are generally understood in the legal profession, not least by the courts.<p>However these terms do not have a fixed definition in law.<p>They are familiar tools – snippets if you like – but they are just words, and still need to be tailored to your particular contract.<p>For example, I usually dispense with ‘Sideground IP&#x27;. Who has ever heard of a ‘sideground’? I wrap up framework and library code into the definition of ‘Background IP’ instead.<p>In any case if you - as a developer - do not understand how these terms apply to your project, insist that your lawyer explains.<p>The law is a technical discipline but it should not be a black art. It’s critical that you are sure that these definitions work for your use case.<p>Alternatively, you could ask your lawyer to re-draft the provisions in plain English. After all, a written contract should merely be a record of what the parties are trying to achieve. For example, you could differentiate between:<p>(i)  the &quot;Client&#x27;s Software&quot;, of which you would assign ownership to your client; and<p>(ii)    the &quot;Developer&#x27;s Tools and Frameworks&quot;, which you own but grant your client a perpetual licence to use them with the Client&#x27;s Software.<p>This is easy enough to draft, but takes a little more care than using an off-the-shelf precedent.<p>It is important to note that any deliverable can contain code that is &quot;Client&#x27;s Software&quot; and other code that is &quot;Developer&#x27;s Tools and Frameworks&quot;, potentially even within the same file.<p>The contract will apply to each set of code as a matter of fact, but it is even better if you mark or comment the code so that it is clear.<p>NB. This post obviously doesn&#x27;t deal with other issues of IP arising: patents, open source, and third party IP. A whole other ball game.<p>This post is not legal advice, of course.",1431602667

The overall rise in GPA over the years though could be influenced by other things I wonder.<p>1. jackpirate mentioned more filler courses<p>2. The internet? If you had a bad professor and a poorly written textbook back in the day, you were kind of screwed outside of working with friends. Today the internet offers pieces of courses and HW examples from all over the world, and things like Coursera and MIT opencourse software are available.<p>3. MORE AP and IB classes allow students to take college level courses but alot of kids at my college for example, in stead of carrying over the credits, chose to retake Calc I & II, even though they had ACED the AP exams, giving them a freshman year filler of courses that were relatively a breeze for them. I don&#x27;t believe as many students took AP and IB classes back then. It seems to be the norm nowadays to use this AP/IB edge to actually help yourself ease into college courses be essentially retaking them. Besides, graduating early from a 4 year university is not encouraged, most kids at that level also want the full 4 year experience so their motivation to transfer the credits goes down.<p>If you think about it, this gives the private universities grades a double edge. you are more likely to be accepted into a competitive private university if you are smart enough to be acing college level courses in highschool, and once you get to the private university, you breeze through those courses by essentially retaking them.<p>Most students used a combination of all three of these things and obtained 3.8-4.0 Freshman year, allowing for more slack when the harder courses started to come in.<p>4. Lets not forget aderall meds are handed out like candy these days to help kids work harder longer. Use of these drugs at top private universities is rampant. In many cases, parents seek out medication for their kids claiming ADHD when really what they are saying is &quot;my kid is not working hard enough to meet up to my standards and because he must be as smart as I am that must be because he is distracted with video games, and therefore has ADHD&quot;. Many kids seek it out for themselves. Roughly 1/3rd of the kids I knew were taking aderall regularly (either with or without prescription) to pull all nighters on a regular basis to keep up in school.<p>one of many easily googled sources: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/education/seeking-academic-edge-teenagers-abuse-stimulants.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/education/seeking-academic...</a><p>5. As for the difference between public and private schools, competitiveness and cheating (illegal use of adderall included) is contagious and I definitely think competition, cheating, use of drugs to work harder longer (as opposed to enjoyment and recreation), seems to exponentiate itself amongst more competitiveness students, which statistically, are more likely to end up at more competitive schools.<p>6. Overall, more and more kids are going to college each year, but interestingly, the applicant pools for public universities does increase, the applicant pool for top private universities is exponential each year, allowing private schools to choose the cream of the crop, potentially creating more of a gap between the general caliber of students between private and public universities.<p>Anecdotal sure but to give you an idea, my friend who went to Johns Hopkins told me stories of kids ripping pages out of textbooks in the libraries so other students had no access, and I&#x27;ve heard this happens at top law schools as well. I witnessed in my private university even as a freshman. In many cases these are kids whose entire identities and their parents value of them depend on acing through ivy league schools, and failure (failure in these case being Bs)is not an option. I can&#x27;t speak for the average public school, but I feel as if this mindset is less likely to be the norm here.<p>one of many sources to help support pt 5 & 6: <a href=""http://nypost.com/2013/08/25/tutor-reveals-ivy-admissions-madness-of-rich-penthouse-parents/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nypost.com/2013/08/25/tutor-reveals-ivy-admissions-ma...</a><p>7. Someone else mentioned visa students who are TAs are pressured to give good grades for good reviews. With underclassmen on student visas, the competition seems to go up and they are in my experience more likely to engage in competitive behavior or cheating or aderall abuse because the stakes of failing out are also alot higher for them, but it seems to have the opposite effect if you are an undergrad versus be a grad grading TA trying to get good reviews from undergrads.<p>Anecdotal story, but proves that not all private schools use grade inflation liberally:<p>At my college, which is a private university ranked top 50, goes up and down each year by 20 or so in rankings, we are not top 5 but usually in top 25, grading is really tough and we were actually ranked top 3 toughest graders lumped in with MIT, except MIT exempts students from their entire freshman GPA (I&#x27;ve heard) to help with suicide and other such issues. Twice I was curved down because grades were so good we were suspected of cheating. The average GPA at my college was 2.7 when I graduated in 2012 and that is after 10% of students fail out. I wish I experienced more grade inflation at my school!<p>In the three cases of severe grade inflation during my undergrad career, the averages on the exams were 20/100 or 40/100, and they had to curve up 30-40 pts just get a third of the class to pass, and still that meant most kids got Bs or Cs. I&#x27;ll never forget when we got 18/100 average for 64 kids in a class and we were all Engineering Majors. Different topic but I believe that results from hiring Professors who are better at research (brings in funding) than they  are at teaching. Theres no reason statstically why the average of 64 students junior year of one of the hardest Engineering Majors at a top Engineering School should all be failing unless of course the Professor sucks at teaching.<p>So in this case, there was severe grade inflation, but that did not results in higher GPAs overall relative to other schools, it just helped A Professor not get in trouble for being responsible for causing the entire Electrical Engineering Department to fail and have to retake her course, which would have definitely put this Professor under review...",1431602004

9544383,comment,9543978,9544310,0,0,darkmighty,,,"The issue is, first, if there is a &#x27;dumb&#x27; clock (and an accompanying &#x27;correct&#x27; clock), then there would be a special reference frame in physics. What you can do is  make a <i>convention</i>: &quot;I&#x27;m measuring my time in reference to the instantaneous inertial frame A of my location on Earth&quot;, and other nearby users from other inertial frames can adjust their clock <i>rate</i> using Lorentz transformation (I need not even mention value  synchronization), such any user from A will see the clocks going at a fixed rate. Second, after adjustment, all users with different velocities will experience their <i>clock</i> going slower.<p>This is the special relativity view and it creates the twin paradox: if your time is going slower and no reference frame is special, couldn&#x27;t we say <i>his</i> time is going slower instead? Who will age faster? This isn&#x27;t really a paradox in special relativity, since in SR (i.e. assuming all observers are in fixed inertial frames) the observers can&#x27;t &quot;age&quot; to meet at a later time: their clocks will diverge, but they will get away from each other so they can never compare how they are aging -- indeed this is a symmetric position. Once you allow them to change frames so they&#x27;re able to compare their own aging, some frame will have to experience acceleration, and hence break symmetry. That is, the paradox resolves in general relativity.<p>All this is well explained on wikipedia (much better than I can do).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox</a>",1431601928

9544371,comment,9543978,9544312,0,0,MichaelCrawford,,,"I expect the letter Dr. Goldberger referred to, was the one to Dr. Hale.<p>Goldberger was quite specific that Einstein asked that the telescope be pointed right at the edge of the sun.  I&#x27;ve studied german but not in enough depth that I could translate Einstein&#x27;s letter.<p>One arc second is not far from the limit of the resolution of an amateur telescope.  While in principle the larger telescopes could resolve finer detail, atmospheric turbulence leads them not to resolve much better - they can see dimmer objects, but not more clearly.  It is only in recent years that adaptive optics, faster imaging sensors and more-sophisticated image processing algorithms enable better resolution.<p>I don&#x27;t know but expect that when the 1919 expedition confirmed GR, it was done by measuring the positions of multiple stars to determine that their positions were, on the average, out of place.  The scope they used was not that big, as they had to carry it out into the African countryside.<p>The tensor calculus used in GR is quite complex.  To reduce that to specific predictions of the star locations would require quite a lot of arithmetic.  Back then they would have used logarithm tables and adding machines.<p>I am willing to concede the Einstein could balance his checkbook, but numerical analysis is hard enough to get right on a modern computer, it is quite hard when done the old-fashioned way, with logarithms and the like.  It would be easy to write down a single digit incorrectly, or to not carry the computation out to enough significant figures.<p>Dr. Goldberg was also quite specific about Einstein&#x27;s computations - not his theory - being &quot;wildly inaccurate&quot;.<p>Finally, that article brought back many memories for me, some good some bad.  I love the Huntington, I love Mt. Wilson but I had a rough time at Caltech.<p>I was, for a very brief time, a solar astronomer, but at Big Bear Lake.",1431601605

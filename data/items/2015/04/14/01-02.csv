9371646,comment,9368031,9369693,0,0,vacri,,,"&#x27;Culturally deeper&#x27;? Western civilisation is the most complex culture the world has ever known.<p>There seems to be this strange idea that &#x27;culture&#x27; means &#x27;has a religious festival&#x27; or somesuch. You hear of some traveller lionising a travel destination as being so culturally deep because they happened to visit when a festival was on. Then, because the home country doesn&#x27;t have <i>that</i> festival or ritual, it&#x27;s seen as culturally bereft.<p>There is a ridiculously wide assortment of activities you can get involved in when you&#x27;re not a scratching at the earth for subsistence - including debating the difference in what &#x27;culture&#x27; means with someone on the other side of the world. Whether you&#x27;re seeing a movie, running a fantasy football league, doling out soup in a soup kitchen, filibustering to stop some random law, fishing through your credit cards for one the plane&#x27;s entertainment system will accept, chewing the fat with a passerby while sitting on your stoop on a hot night, spending a Saturday doing a gastro-tour of a great vineyard region... pretty much <i>any</i> activity you can think of, right down to submitting your tax forms... these are all culture. The more different kinds of people you throw together, the greater the variety of cultural activities available.<p>The idea that we are culturally bereft is just plain wrong. We may not have our priorities right with certain aspects of our culture, but we are drowning in culture. I just don&#x27;t see how culture would be &#x27;deeper&#x27; with less interaction between people from the removal of fossil fuels - we had that for human history up until a couple of hundred years ago, and culture was both slow to change and quite unfair, without being any deeper than it is now.<p>/rant",1428976734

He told me unfortunately that they were not available to the public but then took pity on me by allowing me to use the employee restroom. I went in and saw what was probably the cleanest toilet I have seen in such a public place.<p>In regards to the article, I would say that Asian countries (sans China) are more free to allow public restrooms because culturally it is bad mannered to leave a toilet more dirty than you left it since they are more considerate of other&#x27;s wellbeing (of not having to enter a dirty toilet). I would say it&#x27;s impossible here in the States since most people won&#x27;t give a second thought to peeing on the seat and leaving a turd smeared on the wall.<p>Finally, Airpnp is similar (if not the same to) Have2P, an app that YP/ATT made using it&#x27;s business data back in ~2009.

It&#x27;s a bit like removing the personality of a person and then claiming that made the person better.<p>Also a lot of the things he lists are not at all as clearly harmful as he makes them out to be.<p>GOTO: Used in some of the cleanest code bases. For example the lua programming language, redis db, and linux kernel OS. Yes the use is limited, but it&#x27;s there not because of mistakes but rather because it is sometimes the most clean way.<p>Numbers: I don&#x27;t understand this one. In the very least having different types of numbers seems to be a necessity for anything performance oriented such as graphics. JS not having them (they seem to have been added for WebGL as an extension, no?) is not a good reason for all new languages to do the same.<p>Mutations: I am personally of the view that mutation often simplifies the informal reasoning complexity of a program. There&#x27;s a reason functional programming hasn&#x27;t caught on and it likely never will. A hybrid approach of having both immutability and mutability like Rust seems most sensible.<p>Reference equality (Referential transparency?): If you have immutability do you not get this for free? How can you be sure about getting rid of mutations but not be sure you want objects to be equal based on data?<p>Each language has it&#x27;s own quirks that make it special and that&#x27;s part of the reason programming is fun.

I do believe that automatically building a hierarchical structure  (as I assume happens in deep learning) is the way to abstract away complexity but I think this is achievable within a generative bayesian monte carlo approach.<p>For example, I have been toying with using MCMH similarly to how it is used in dippl.org to write a kind of probabilistic program that generates other programs by sampling from a probabilistic programming language grammar. A bit like with the arithmetic generator here: <a href=""https://probmods.org/learning-as-conditional-inference.html#example-inferring-an-arithmetic-expression"" rel=""nofollow"">https://probmods.org/learning-as-conditional-inference.html#...</a>\nbut for whole programs.<p>After the MCMH has converged to a program that generates approximately correct output, you can tune grammar hyperparameters on the higher likelihood output program samples so that next time it will converge faster.<p>I don&#x27;t know if this counts as approximating &quot;the generative distribution and the inference distribution at the same time&quot; under your definition but my hope is that the learned grammar rules are good abstractions for hierarchical generators of learned concepts.<p>Of course the worry is that my approach will not converge very fast but there are reasons to think that having a suitably arranged hyperparametrized probabilistic grammar might use the Occams&#x27; razor inherent in bayesian methods to produce exponentially fewer, simpler grammar rules that generate approximations when it doesn&#x27;t have enough data to converge to more complex and precise programs and that these simple rules which rely on fewer parameters might provide the necessary intermediate steps to then pivot to more complex rules. These smaller steps help MCMH to find a convergence path. Not sure how well it will work for complex problems however. My idea is still half baked. I have ton&#x27;s of loose ends and details I have not figured out, some of which I might not even have a solution, as well as little time to work on this (this is just a hobby for me).<p>Anyways, all that to say that probabilistic programming can go beyond just hardcoding a generative model and running it.",1428974084

You also criticised someone else for being an &quot;armchair lawyer&quot; (implying you&#x27;re not).<p>> You can apply for adjustment of status immediately after exchanging vows.<p>&quot;Applying&quot; sounds great, but you are in no way granted anything while the process is on-going. In fact they very specifically recommend you avoid travelling to the US while your visa in processes, as that could result in a &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and them junking your visa because they believe you&#x27;re living in the US already.<p>That&#x27;s the advice I was given in person by someone at the US embassy in London.

Your comment here is full of misinformation and dangerous misinformation at that.

You could even redirect conditionally, i.e. modern browsers and search engines are redirected to port 443 while the remainder are told to try port 31276.<p>Is this ugly? Yes. Do people care? No. A client of mine who uses shared hosting is perfectly happy with HTTPS on port 44527. Most people don&#x27;t even look at the URL.

(Of course it doesn&#x27;t, but their misconception doesn&#x27;t make their website any less secure, so I don&#x27;t care.)<p>Older browsers not supporting secure ciphers/protocols is a bigger problem, but you can also get around this to some extent by offering better ciphers/protocols on port 443 and lesser ciphers/protocols on an alternate port.",1428973402

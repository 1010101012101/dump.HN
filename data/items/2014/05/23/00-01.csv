About a 35% drop overnight May 20th.<p>An observation that we have made over the years is that significant changes to Google&#x27;s algorithms always seem to soften in the subsequent months for us and we return to a high level in the Google SERPs.<p>The site in question is a site where we curate free crafts projects and patterns which my spouse and I began in the 90&#x27;s with our family and friends. The idea was to gather together excellent crafts projects on little known mostly small sites with the criteria that they are free, complete, usually require no email/login and are within two clicks of us. We still update it every week.<p>Over the years we have used user feedback to make design decisions. For example, when Pinterest became popular we got a lot of feedback to use masonry instead of tables for our images/links and lately we&#x27;ve been moving to make it fully responsive because we get a lot of feedback from tablet users.<p>The only time we were manually penalized by Google involved an issue where we had ignored our user&#x27;s complaints about so they were right and we were wrong. We fixed it.<p>Our site looks thin to an algorithm and we almost always get hit by large algorithm changes but over the subsequent months, the site always moves back up and ranks very well. We can only imagine that this means the algorithm is somehow tempered by our visitor&#x27;s behavior (we use adsense and analytics so they see all) and is not simply a switch that is thrown and left on.<p>I have to wonder how much MetaFilter has done to gather user feedback.

7787343,comment,7786720,7786720,9,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"EDIT: Experience with Fab is based on December 2012 - March 2013.<p>When I sold through them as a vendor I remember Fab being extremely inefficient in nearly everything they did. I had to email a good 3-5 people to get anything done because nothing was automated. From shipments to payments to setting up the sale to uploading media and printing out orders and postage. Everything was done manually by emailing someone and yes there were mistakes.<p>I had to use excel, save the file they emailed, and email it back to them just to set up a proposal for a sale. Yes, Microsoft Excel. And they sent any type of instructions in PDF formats.<p>They also used some really expensive shipping options even though I had cheaper alternatives and was doing fulfillment myself. I had to manually sign up for a UPS account and get approved to have them charged and all sorts of nonsense. They also wanted me to set up a UPS pick up ($8) every day. With their margins I just don&#x27;t understand how they made money. Apparently they weren&#x27;t which is why things got bad.<p>And their marketing was just such a waste at times. They&#x27;d mail a 3 sided folded postcard on extremely thick paper with only 3 random items on it (that weren&#x27;t even interesting) and their &quot;Fab, Smile, you&#x27;re designed to&quot; logo. They did a terrible job advertising and it all lacked thoughtfulness.<p>Their in-house fulfillment team used custom boxes that were printed in all BLACK ink and on top of that had printing on the inside with their logos and catch phrase on the inside and out. I have never in my life seen shipping boxes that expensive used to ship an item.<p>EDIT: I&#x27;m not saying they weren&#x27;t nice to work with, they were all extremely pleasant, just the system of doing things was very inefficient. Rather than emailing me so many different forms and PDF instructions they could have linked to them on the FAB control panel. It&#x27;s the CEOs job of ensuring the systems a business uses are efficient and it seems that&#x27;s what destroyed them. Wasting money.",1400803749

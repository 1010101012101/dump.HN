That's simple in every other text editing program I'd used up to that point, but when given the choice to improve the program's usability or ""extend it"" and ""write cool modes,"" you're right, Emacs users seem to invariably prefer the latter.

This is in fact a really bad idea and should be avoided.<p>The main argument for shortening domains seems to be based on what people will type.  But every web browser I've seen will try ""www.xyz.com"" any time you type just ""xyz"".  So leave the interpretation of lazy typing to the browser bar where it can be converted into a canonical form on behalf of the user.<p>There are plenty of reasons <i>not</i> to make the raw domain a web site.  Here are a few:<p>- Potentially destroys popularity rankings in search engines because there are multiple addresses for every page.  One popular site instead looks like two less-popular sites.<p>- So-called CNAME in DNS cannot use bare domains.  IP addresses must therefore be hard-coded in a way that is more difficult to change quickly as needed (e.g. load-balancing, discovery of a DDoS attack, whatever).  So users of the raw domain ""xyz.com"" will see your site go down for longer than it should have, even if you've already managed to bring ""www.xyz.com"" back up by changing its IP address.<p>- Configurations where patterns may be useful don't work, e.g. neither ""{glob}.xyz.com"" nor ""www.{glob}"" will match a bare domain.  Maybe you don't care if you have just one site to worry about, but this gets old if you have a lot of domains to worry about.",1324672315

I agree with you that it has a much more specific meaning as a predicate compliment: ""I'm entitled to my own opinion.""<p>Language changes. People sometimes still complain about ""hopefully"" being used as a sentence modifier, as in, ""Hopefully language mavens will see their role in speech communities as custodians and curators of beneficial older conventions, rather than as guardians and protectors of acrolectic law.""

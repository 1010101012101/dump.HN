IPO always was and always will be the best financing option down the road for great companies, Stripe included.  Yes, there is a bit more regulation with SoX and such, and yes it&#x27;s a bit more painful than it used to be back in the days, but some regulatory overhead makes not one iota of difference to a great company. Sure, middle of the road companies in VC&#x27;s portfolios may not find IPOs as attractive as they were before and will exit through M&A.<p>As you can see from CEO&#x27;s post a few above, these guys are nowhere near done, they have their work cut out for them in terms of expansion and accordingly a ton of growth prospects ahead.  From that standpoint and because private funding is plentiful and attractive for a company of this profile, I agree - IPO is probably not the best choice at the moment [but you can read above post between the lines that they are heading there]. You see, in an IPO, they would need to sell a bigger chunk of the company to have a decent liquidity in the stock and private markets allow them to &quot;right-size&quot; the rounds.  Also, the whole IPO process is a lot of work and bit of a pain and could be distracting from day-to-day business of running a rocket ship.",1417579047

The primary stakeholders in the H1B discussion are not only local labor, but also the consumers of the products and services produced by the companies that hired H1B&#x27;s, and the investors in these companies. And consumers and investors have a right to obtain their products and services at a reasonable cost. This is not xenophilia, it&#x27;s simply reality. This is the economic rationale behind Wal Mart sourcing globally.<p>And as the original post points out, it is not always about low cost, its also about quality. Would you consider Satya Nadella or Sundar Pichai to be cheap labor?<p>There is another matter. Why don&#x27;t you look up the phrase &quot;indentured servant&quot; on wikipedia? It refers to (quote from wikipedia) &quot; a labor system where by young people paid for their passage to the New World by working for an employer for a certain number of years. It was widely employed in the 18th century in the British colonies in North America and elsewhere. It was especially used as a way for poor youth in Britain and the German states to get passage to the American colonies. They would work for a fixed number of years, then be free to work on their own. The employer purchased the indenture from the sea captain who brought the youths over; he did so because he needed labour (sic). Some worked as farmers or helpers for farm wives, some were apprenticed to craftsmen.&quot; \nBasically, this system which brought in the ancestors of most Americans is very similar to the H1B system in place, right down to the duration of indenture: 7 years, while the H1B has a 6 year time limit.<p>Been happening all-the-time, my friend.

Originally I signed up to get an MS in Innovation Management (startups, new business tech., corporate finance for IT etc.) because my employer was keen on supporting my academic goals esp. if they coincided with my position as Director of IT. But one week before classes were to start, they dropped the entire program and &quot;specially waived the MBA requirements&quot; just for me and shoved me into their MBA program.<p>After I spent 1.5 years taking MBA courses, they revived the MS IM degree but wouldn&#x27;t let me transfer any credits from MBA program into it, even though most of the early classes were same, taught by the same teachers.<p>It was then that I realized that the past few years of &quot;leadership&quot;, &quot;value proposition&quot;, and &quot;customer-specific&quot; drivel they had been feeding me was not something they actually cared about. They cared about enrollment, enrollment, and enrollment. I should know. The goal of the last class I took - Advanced Marketing - was to come up with surveys to find out what would increase enrollment into their MBA program.<p>Initially I felt like a failure even considering dropping out because I was only 2 semesters away from getting my MBA. But then I realized life is too short to be wasting time doing what you don&#x27;t want to do.

Surely you see that a computer can solve for the nyquist reconstruction of some lower sample-rate recording (e.g. CD audio) to that sample rate, and then (still in digital 96khz) remove ALL the noise between say 21khz and 96khz, at which point a final analog filter will have an easy time leaving 0-21khz unmolested while killing all higher frequencies, right?

As a result, it felt like the whole premise of law school (at least for most students), namely that you could get decent grades and would have a high paying job at some firm upon graduation, was completely shattered. This turned out to be completely true for the majority of people who attended at that time. Everyone was trying to find internships at the end of their first year, but there just weren&#x27;t any to go around and people who had received offers in their third year were seeing them slip away.<p>I remember thinking at the time that given the economy and the massive layoffs that were occurring that applications to my school would be going down, but what I saw was quite the contrary.

People seemed to be using the economic downturn and poor job market as an opportunity to &quot;invest in the future&quot; and go back to school. But I just couldn&#x27;t understand how tuitions could stay propped up and I felt there had to be some correlation between the salaries/availability of jobs post law school and the high tuitions.

But it just didn&#x27;t seem like there was a need for a &quot;use bcrypt&quot; response since from the context these were not passwords in the classical sense. That&#x27;d be an inappropriate operation to have on the authorization fast path.<p>That said, I think we&#x27;d be talking of something like this for a web framework session storage attack:<p>Assumptions:<p>- A separate chained hash table implementation that doesn&#x27;t use any kind of per-table randomization (e.g. like what Perl does for DOS prevention).<p>- A string comparison function that&#x27;s not constant time.<p>What the attacker would do:<p>- Log in, observe session key.<p>- Generate on client side other tokens that would hash to the same bucket as the real session key<p>- Use a timing attack using the generated keys to determine the number of other session keys in the same hash bucket.<p>- Repeat with new logins until they find a bucket with exactly one other session key.<p>- Conduct a timing attack on the first character of the other session key in the bucket. (I.e. generate 256 fake session keys all hashing to the same bucket, each starting with a different byte).<p>- Conduct a timing attack on the second character.<p>- And so on.<p>- Once you&#x27;ve found a genuine session key, see whether it granted you any elevated rights.<p>Seems to me that the only thing that&#x27;s needed is the ability to generate strings with an arbitrary prefix that hash to an arbitrary bucket. Without giving it too much thought, that seems pretty simple. I must be missing something here since you guys are finding this to be such an outlandish idea.

The feature set you have put together might be very useful to some potential users who aren't bands. You might be in one of those ""we built it thinking of market X but ended up filling a need for Y"" sort of situations.",1173883372

4120,comment,3882,4100,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I'm wondering if this reply is a joke because none of those areas are still in their infancy, especially parallel processing and speech processing. If you really meant to say that their potential hasn't been realized, then is it possible that expectation levels were too high to begin with? Same thing with higher level programming languages. How long have people been working on ML, Haskell, LISP, etc? What you really mean is natural language programming languages, like English, Chinese, etc. as programming languages.<p>The flip side is that some problems that were thought to be easy to solve may, in fact, be unsolvable (practically or theoretically). Computer vision is a good example of this. <p>I'm not trying to start a war or play devil's advocate for the sake of playing. My comments come from a real place. I have a PhD in computer science and was a professor in the field at a top university in the US. As sobering as it is to think about, I have serious concerns about CS  because the problem landscape looks a little flat. The first mountain was computation (e.g., microprocessors), then usability, then networking/communications. What's next? I believe a big breakthrough in established fields like AI, VR, etc. are low probability using existing computational models, the weak proof being that a lot of very bright people have been working on these hard problems for a very long time and advances appear to be small and incremental. I don't know if QC will hold any promises in this area, maybe so.",1173882538

This begs the question of what YC is: is it a company that forms more companies, or is it an angel-firm that creates more angel-firms?<p>The latter can work only by forming these new angel-firms in different startup-beds.  There are only a limited number of startup-beds, and a limited number of connections that can be used by partners.  When these resources are used up, the only choice is to move to another area and start again.<p>The former is what YC already does, within the limits of the partners.  Adding new partners could increase the number of companies funded each year, but only to a limited extent.  Finding a partner is hard because it needs to be someone that won't disturb the current dynamic and who will bring in new connections/resources that aren't currently represented.<p>Frankly, I don't see any way to truly scale what YC does.  Encouraging startups to form is limited by its very nature to within bounds formed by the market.  These bounds have not yet been reached, but still exist.",1173881047

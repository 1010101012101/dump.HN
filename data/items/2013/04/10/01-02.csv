Whenever there's a background transaction of data, even a kilobyte. That means if my phone is kept for 30 minutes and I get a call, I need to click through those 10-20 accumulated pop-up windows on my Android screen to receive the call or do anything on my phone. On mornings when there's no Wi-Fi I usually get some 70-100 such pop-ups. I counted. Sometimes I better switch off and then switch on the phone to avoid clicking through those pop-ups.<p>The cellular operator (Airtel India) says it's a feature and argues that every operator has it and that iPhone, BlackBerry and Windows (etc) users don't have this problem. True.<p>Samsung support says - this is Google feature and then is quick to add - <i>but we never sold Galaxy Nexus in India. No support there. Sorry, bye-bye.</i><p>I go to raise a Google-code issue just like this.

That was really good considering that my peers who stayed in Houston got around $60k it seems. Anyway, even I could not afford to get a house with a yard in the city center (""within biking distance""). At least, not any sort of decent home that one would want to live in. A nice 1br apartment in the city center (nice = safe, clean, updated appliances, washer/dryer in the unit, etc.) is also going to cost $1k/month minimum--anything less and you'll be giving up safety, comfort, or proximity. Of course, that's a far cry from SV, but it's still far from ridiculously cheap as well.<p>As for a house out in a suburb? Absolutely.

I hadn't thought about tracing the cell phone before, of all things.<p>Practically, it seems like a stretch to try and look at GPS logs through a carrier and prove that someone was at a bank at a given time. It says the precision is down to 2 hours, so you can theoretically get to a bank, not make/receive any calls, and get back before that 2 hour window and nothing would ever be recorded by the cell towers. If anything, this only proves that you were in a geographic region. Plausible deniability?<p>Also, this problem goes away completely if you leave your cell phone at home.

In <i>theory</i> I agree with you; in practice I find it very easy to mis-navigate in Vim and find myself next to the wrong equals sign, or on the wrong side of the equals sign, or what have you. And in my experience, recovering from one of those errors, as quick as it is, makes me wonder why I didn't just use the mouse (or trackball, in my case) to click next to the damn equals sign in the first place. (Keyboard jockeys -- which I'm frequently one of, to be fair -- often underestimate how fast using the mouse actually is, I suspect, because we think of it as, ""Oh, I have to move my hand <i>all the way over there</i> and move something and then <i>move back,</i> that's nuts!"" Again in practice, I suspect the mouse removes a great deal of the cognitive load involved in navigation, and that may balance out more often than we're inclined to give it credit for.)<p>Incidentally, in Sublime Text -- as well as Emacs and most Mac OS X applications, as this is a system-wide keyboard binding -- you could just hit ^K after the equals sign for ""delete everything from here to the end of the line.""",1365558421

5522709,comment,5521029,5522567,20,0,ww520,,,"Latch is a popular term in the database world.  It's used to avoid confusing with the term Lock in a database.  Lock in RDBMS usually associates with transaction, data in the tables, data consistence, etc.  It has long term semantic and deadlock can be a problem due to user actions.  Latch is same as a lock in the traditional CS sense.  It's a mutax or semaphore in memory to protect shared data structure in memory, e.g. a paged in index page in memory.  The locked duration usually is very short, and deadlock is not a problem due to user actions.<p>When walking a B+ tree index, the usual code often uses latches to have exclusive access to the index pages being walked from root on the way down so that the pages won't be split due to overflow caused by other threads since the walking thread itself can cause a split and needs to updates the walked pages.  Smarter implementation would shorten the list of locked pages when it finds a page with enough room that won't split even if its child pages split.  This shortens the scope of the locking of the walk but there are still pages being locked.<p>This can be a single point of contention when a lot of index walking happen.  Pretty much most db operations touch the index.  This is especially problematic in modern memory rich systems where most hot data are paged into memory so the locking of the index during walking stuck out like a sore thumb.<p>A latch-free B+ tree would allow multiple threads to walk the index at the same time, thus removing the single point of contention and allowing massive scaling with more threads added.",1365557807

It's also common for coworkers to have lunch together, or having visiting customers for lunch and other ""business"" scenarios.<p>Also, I know how much $ Google spends with food per employee, and it's a significantly lower number than what I would pay for the same amount and quality of food anywhere -- a small part of that due to no sales tax, but the bulk of savings comes from big economies of scale, very efficient operations, and no profit margin.<p>I am a Brazilian, and there most companies provide complimentary compensation as food coupons that are subsidized by not paying income or payroll taxes (both are very high in BR). Even higher-salaried employees get these coupons, usually in a value that's proportional to the salary; for an engineer that's high enough you can feed your whole family... when I lived alone I couldn't hope to spend all my coupons, so whenever I had a lot of accumulated excess I'd donate that to a charity. Now THAT is an obvious loophole to increase wages at the expense of taxes. Compared to this, the free food in companies like Google is available only to the employee, only at office, and it has no relation to your salary -- everybody gets the same food and other office perks.<p>There's an important element of healthcare too. Companies that can afford to provide free lunches are always also, companies that subsidize most or all of their employee's health insurance, which is a huge cost. The company has interest in managing employee health to minimize costs of insurance and sick leave; and Google certainly does that, they use lots of tricks and tactics to promote a healthy diet.<p>To summarize, this is much more complex than just ""giving freebies"" like some other posters think.",1365557094

It is pervasive in just about every enterprise IT environment throughout the entire world (whether you realize it or not), running on a ~billion devices and, now, Android phones as well.<p>Furthermore, it has very mature support for everything from GUIs (Swing) to web development (Servlet) to high-powered concurrency to advanced data structures.  There are literally thousands of libraries and frameworks for every need and a wealth of talent and knowledge out there. Its performance is also orders of magnitude better than interpreted languages like PHP, Python or Ruby.  It simply scales better in just about every way and is universally supported almost everywhere.<p>So, to summarize, for all the reasons listed above Java is the bread and butter of enterprise software.

So the h1 should be optimized for the keywords you are trying to rank for. Also, if you have a bunch of h1 tags on a single page, it can actually dilute the weight of your most important heading. I recommend using just one h1 tag on a page to keep Google from having to guess what is most important. I also recommend not using any other h tags on the page for the same reason. Don't try to rank for a bunch of keywords on one page. Instead, concentrate on one or related keywords per page and use h tags to signal to the search engine what you think is most important.<p>Search engines are dumb.

For starters, it uses 'latch' and 'latch-free' probably a hundred times, in lieu of the ubiquitous'lock' and 'lock-free' .  I gather from Google that this is an Oracle thing[1]; they call spinlocks 'latches' and more complicated queueing locks 'enqueues'.<p>It would also be good to know more about the skip list implementation they compared against; their description in VI.A doesn't sound like any concurrent skip list I'm aware of (e.g., Java's java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListMap).  They don't say what all their BW-tree implementation includes, but if it's just the data structure, 10k lines of C++ is an order of magnitude larger than even pretty complex concurrent skip lists.<p>[1] <a href=""http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTION_ID:10899066672589"" rel=""nofollow"">http://asktom.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=100:11:0::::P11_QUESTI...</a>",1365555849

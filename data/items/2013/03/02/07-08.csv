5308905,comment,5298663,5298663,1,0,testerfromleic,,,"TL;DR - we (testers) need to tackle these problems head on ourselves rather than wait for people to ""get it"".<p>It seems to me, a lot of folks here wouldn't be adverse to using a freelance tester in general, but are extremely adverse to using bad freelance testing (and have the scars to prove it!).<p>I'm a contract tester and recently decided to make the transition to freelance. From my experience (and confirmed by the comments here) the main barrier is one of perception - how can testers / add value to my organisation? And how do I know this tester is as good as they claim?<p>There are numerous ways someone like me can help an organisation:<p>Help organisations find the right permanent employees; Mentor said permanent employees by sharing knowledge; provide testing experience to a known or unknown business domain; supplement the clients test lab with your own equipment; evangelise testing throughout the company, demonstrate what good testing can do, what it looks like<p>I had to stop myself there! And pretty much all of those examples are from recent (within 12 months) history. Luckily for me I've been able build a decent enough reputation that there is potential for repeat business.<p>Two more key problems: first, the kind of testers that people here need may live in a bubble where everyone knows the value of testing and as such may not realise the rest of us exist - my colleagues and I need to start dispensing some red pills :). Second, the testers that are trying to be better appear to be outnumbered by the ones that aren't (snake oil merchants, testing zombies, call them what you will) so again we need to tackle that head on too.<p>Nice discussion.

Many kids do want to maybe be an English or History major and then teach.  Far, far fewer want to be an art major and try to survive as an artist (or even an art teacher).<p>As far as math goes, maybe not all that many kids want to be mathematicians, but plenty do take a fair bit of math on their way to becoming engineers, programmers, doctors, and scientists.  They all certainly take far more math courses than art courses.<p>Of course, few artists take many math courses, but there are far fewer art students than there are students of professions that rely on math and need a decent education in math to graduate.<p><i>""so many americans drop in favor of studying philosophy""</i><p>Oh please.  There are probably fewer philosophy majors in the US who actually want to do philosophy after school than art majors (of which there are very few).  There'd be even fewer overall if philosophy wasn't the number one major of students accepted in to law school.  Most philosophy majors just use that major as a means to get in to law school.",1362210884

Your professional development is up to you. If you are passionate about your choice of a profession, then money shouldn't matter. You will do what ever it takes to learn, experiment and grow your skills because it is what you want. At work we do what we have to to get things done. If we are contributing to our personal experience on work time, are we not taking away from the task at hand if the exploration does not further that task? Hopefully, you can someday work for a company that encourages and facilitates personal development woot!. Hackathons are all about getting together and sharing ideas and pushing the envelope. Or should be in any case. The venue, the timing, the subject matter, all contribute or detract from the experience. But most of all it is the mix of people that make the difference, and the experience itself. Some of my best experiences have been late nights in a ""skunk-works"" project, building something we weren't sure could be built, and sure enough we did it! It didn't feel like work it felt like an adventure! I hope you get to experience something like that in the future. Don't confuse work and making yourself better.

There are many people who can afford to buy and maintain them in this world. Not all of them do. Just like many people can afford to buy works of art, but not all of them do. Why? Because one doesn't really need a sports car, just like one doesn't really need an art piece. The author's essay isn't one of the lament of the hard times of an artist. It is a lament of the diminishing of creativity because his definition of creativity is rooted in a traditionalist idea of creativity as resting solely in the lap of artists. Before the PC revolution no one would want their kids to be programmers. ""Programmers were smelly fat white kids"". Now it's a hot commodity. Welcome to the markets. Mathematicians were ""useless theorists"" till a couple of decades ago (as a matter of fact many people still think this). Until industrialization, scientists were a bunch of ""rich white guys, not in tune to the needs of the common man"". And more importantly, up until recently, engineers were little math nerds, easy bait for the MBA alpha dudes.<p>You're confusing economic safety with societal respect. If you're talking about the economic aspect, as far as being a professional artist, well guess what; when I was a kid I wanted to be a poet. Poems wouldn't keep a roof over my head and hell, at the time, neither would code. Hasn't stopped me from writing poems in my spare time and engaging in my other pursuits. If ever a time comes when one could sustainably make money selling art, then I'm sure many artists and even non artists will flood the market. But economics isn't the author's thesis.",1362210185

If you're an art teacher, good f'ing luck.<p>The cold, hard fact is that art, music, dance, and theater are not considered serious occupations by the overwhelming majority of people in the US (despite their worship of celebrity artists, musicians, and actors).  If it's their kid, they want the kid to be a doctor, lawyer, or (more recently) dotcom billionaire.<p>Art/music/dance/drama class just does not fit in to this very narrow-minded view of the world, where profit and fame are king.  Some kids are so driven that they might take an art class (usually their first semi-serious one is in high school.. and by then, how many math classes have they had?) or even study it at university.  But if they do study it at university, it's either as one of many electives or (if as a major) against their parents' objections -- because most parents know how hard it is to ""succeed"" in this society as an artist, musician, dancer, writer, or actor.<p>If you are an engineer or programmer, nevermind doctor or lawyer, you're going to usually be taken much more seriously and get more respect from most people than any kind of non-celebrity artist.  And funding in the schools generally reflects these sad but all too common views.<p>Unfortunately, scientists and teachers are often in the same boat as far as lack of respect as artists are.  But even there, the amount of funding given to educating more scientists and teachers is far greater than that devoted to educating various artists.<p>The dollar is king in America, and the overwhelming majority of artists are near the bottom rung of the money ladder in this country.  Odds are you'll make far more money working at McDonalds than you ever will as any kind of artist.  And, a bit of philanthropy notwithstanding, the rest of society reflects this monetary bias.",1362209084

The ""futurology"" section of its wikipedia article is about predicting a future in which the dystopian state depicted in the novel is stable, and persists indefinitely. (That is, the one discussing futurology as a theme of Orwell's work. It has nothing to do with machines taking over art or whatever nonsense the author has projected onto Orwell's work.)<p>That 'artists' shy away from systems thinking is a ridiculous assertion. The first person who comes to mind is Leonardo Da Vinci:<p>From the wikipedia article bearing his name,<p>""Renaissance humanism recognized no mutually exclusive polarities between the sciences and the arts, and Leonardo's studies in science and engineering are as impressive and innovative as his artistic work.[17] These studies were recorded in 13,000 pages of notes and drawings, which fuse art and natural philosophy (the forerunner of modern science), made and maintained daily throughout Leonardo's life and travels, as he made continual observations of the world around him.[17]"" [0]<p>I would argue that systems thinking and understanding the world around us is essential to produce art that isn't descended from something like a cargo cult.<p>>Over the next 100 years, the importance of creativity will trump systems thinking due to the rapidly escalating power of computers.<p>First of all, systems thinking is more than just computer programming. In the same way that cybernetics is more than just computer programming. Writing programs that do what you want and do what you mean without actually specifying the operations involved is something that I would think is an AI complete problem.<p>In other words, to explain the problem you must first understand the problem, hence systems thinking.<p>>No, Im not talking about an apocalyptic Rise of the Machines, but rather about the future ascent of people who excel in creativity, intuition, and the marshaling of original solutions, things that computers wont be able to do for a long time.<p>I'd bet money computer algorithms that can write code can draw you a picture. (That is to say, 'creativity' is also an AI complete problem.)<p>>In the United States, the key predictive score to spot a good systems thinker-- our future leaders-- has been the SAT and IQ tests.<p>I think the biggest name on wikipedias ""list of mensans"" is Buckminster Fuller. With a membership of 110K, I would expect a larger list if IQ was an almost 1:1 predictor of success.[1]<p>The rest is just design dressing.<p>[0]: Taken from the article, Fri Mar  1 23:26:15 PST 2013\n(<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_vinci"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_vinci</a>)<p>[1]: One could argue that wikipedia may not have an exhaustive list of MENSA members who went on to do great deeds. My reasoning is that because wikipedia is a community project, the people who would compile a list like that are probably MENSA members who want to brag.

The search warrant accused \n  Columbia Packing of intentionally dumping waste into the \n  creek located a couple of hundred yards behind our plant.\n\n  Let me be very clear: Columbia Packing did not and has not \n  intentionally or knowingly polluted or illegally dumped \n  hazardous materials. Our sewer line ties into a City of \n  Dallas sewer main. It does NOT dump into the creek as has \n  been alleged.\n\n  There was a clog in the sewer line near a cleanout valve.  \n  When water was used (i.e. washing down after production), \n  the sewer line was backing up causing water to come out an \n  overflow/vent pipe.  The city of Dallas apparently knew \n  there was a problem on December 9th, but allowed it to \n  continue and did not notify us until 41 days later when \n  government agencies served search warrants.\n\n  Two days before the warrants were served, a Columbia lawn \n  mowing crew discovered the sewer overflow. We immediately \n  called a plumber and took swift action to begin stopping \n  the overflow. The clog was cleared and the line was open \n  and running cleanly into the citys sewer main in less \n  than 24 hours.\n\n  If the city had contacted us on December 9th, the problem \n  would have been fixed the same day. Instead, the city \n  knowingly allowed this overflow to continue for 41 days.  \n  Government officials did something my family never would \n  have done- they allowed products to contaminate the \n  Trinity River for more than a month without taking \n  corrective action. The City has full access to our \n  property at all times to test the sewer line. At any time, \n  officials could have entered our property to find the \n  source of the overflow.\n\n  There is no cross connection between our sewer line and \n  storm water. The City has now dye-tested and camera \n  inspected our sewer lines, and our sewer line is clear and \n  goes to the city sewer main.  The city maintains a box on \n  our sewer line that has for years monitored the amount of \n  waste water going through the line and the substances \n  contained in the waste water.  The city monitors this \n  locked box on its own schedule.\n\n  When the City searched our property they found 18 possible \n  code violations. Within 30 days we addressed and repaired \n  each issue the City brought to our attention. Keep in \n  mind, our Oak Cliff facility has been in operation since \n  the early 1930s, and the City of Dallas has never cited us \n  for any violations in the past.</code></pre>",1362207996

I'm virtually never as good as I want to be.  My work rarely turns out the way I want; and this doesn't even begin to touch on issues of coming up with ideas and creativity/originality.  Learning to deal with and live with failure is just something many ordinary artists have to do constantly.<p>""Fail early and often"" is as much of a maxim to live by for artists as it is for entrepreneurs.<p>Perhaps 1 in 100, or 1 in 1000 works will be something you're pleased with, and then you can count that as a success.  Or perhaps the journey can be counted as much or more of a success than the destination.  A lot depends on your expectations.<p>William Staford was once asked how he was able to write a poem every day.  He answered, ""I lower my standards.""",1362207881

5308799,comment,5308611,5308611,158,0,qzxt,,,"This talk of ""right-brain"" revolution has become so popular that no one even realizes the fundamental irony of it all. The fallacy that the ""creative"" arts have been under appreciated in society is the largest piece of bollocks I've ever heard. I voluntarily teach math at a school here in MN, so i get some insight into what's going on at the schools and the fact is, while the politicians and corporations are sounding off about STEM, at schools people are still talking more about funding ""the arts"". Before the rise of the ""geek billionaires"" guess the largest form of cultural philanthropy: ""the arts"" (probably still is). We have more people who graduate with degrees in dance than we do people who graduate with degrees in mathematics. Hollywood probably has more failed actors than the valley has failed entrepreneurs. We have more art and history museums than we have science and engineering museums. Unless you've made a lot of money and you've been on the cover of Forbes, or you put an autonomous vehicle on Mars while wearing a Mohawk, telling people you're a programmer/mathematician/scientist is more likely to get them to presumptuously assume you're some mechanistic robot than for them to say ""wow, interesting stuff"". This new wave of complaining about the lack of attention to ""the creative arts"" reminds me of that good old cultural phenomenon known as mansplaining. But these are ""the arts"" so I guess they're artsplaining (badum-bam)<p>That ""left brain/right brain"" business is the stupidest, most egregious display of a lack of understanding of basic neuroscience. It is a metaphor. You know, that thing the ""creatives"" love so much. it is a metaphor used to explain different psychological states. There is no physical hemispheric dominance (edit: with regard to how one thinks about things, not with regard to physical processes.), there are just ways of thinking. Those who examine things more deeply are said to be ""left brained"" and those who make connections at the high-level are said to be ""right brained"". It is not an excuse for why people suck at math or programming. It is not some genetic gift/curse only placed on a few people. As a matter of fact nobody is ever always right-brained/left-brained. People go with the mode of thinking they feel is appropriate for the situation. Besides STEM, analytical thinking is necessary in philosophy, literature, economics, sociology, and all other forms of the humanities, because they're not just a bunch of people sitting down, looking for the best way to jerk off their egos by saying the ""deepest"" thing (at least they're not supposed to be).<p>Second, this resurgence of math envy is merely a reflection of the fact that the importance of science and math are finally being recognized in society. So the author shouldn't get his panties in a bunch; no one is dragging the humanities down from it's privileged societal prestige. We simply don't have to scramble for answers to give to kids when they ask why all this algebra stuff is important. In reality, it's important in the same way history, literature, and civics is important: it's not. None of them are. Are you telling me high school history and civics left you with the propensity to be a more informed voter? Are you telling me you really genuinely explored the theme of revenge in Hamlet? Or did you just read the spark notes? Henry Ford couldn't read well and famously didn't know the date of the American Revolution, he still rose from a farm boy to becoming one of the richest men in this country (he was also a good engineer). STEM is important to know in the same way humanities and ""creative arts"" are important in that they are ways to help you understand the world. Simple as. The only difference is it's a lot harder to convince them that ""physics is what powers your car"" than it is to BS them about how history makes us a more informed society (seriously, have to taken a look out there? it's a freakin' jungle!)<p>Third, and most important. He's right. Don't learn to code, learn to draw. Fuck it, learn to ride a bicycle. Next week, I'm going to start swimming lessons - in my twenties! Our senseless push to get kids to learn to code is like this senseless hyper-aggrandizing of the ""creatives"". We should be teaching kids to learn to think. It's easy to do stuff. It's easy to train kids to learn some task for some as-at-yet determined future purpose. It's easy to code. It's easy to draw. What's hard is thinking, and that's where the creativity is. As a matter of fact, not only is the cultural perception of coding and math as more mechanistic in contrast with humanities and the ""creative arts"" wrong, the opposite is , in fact, the case. Anyone who has every learned a musical instrument and doesn't look back on it with rose-colored glasses can attest to the mechanistic heartlessness of the piano or the guitar. Drawing is merely the act of building a motor skill. So is dancing. But guess what, once you're done with the hours of torture to get good, then you realize the fun. When you come back from school and drop your bags and you bang out a perfect rendition of Chopin's Prelude No 4, then you truly understand the magnificence of the piano. Much in the same way, when you've crammed the ifs and elses, the fors and whiles, the variables and constants, the pointers and pointers to pointers, and pointers to functions, and pointers to pointers to pointers to functions, and then you go on to build that thingamabob or model that gene sequence or understand that earthquake, then you realize the true power of what you've been working with. So this false dichotomy of ""creatives"" and mechanistic science robots propped up by people who simply don't want to learn math and are mad that not knowing math and science is less of a badge of honor in society anymore misses the point. And while it reads nice (hey, it has nice fonts, man) and could be a nice rallying cry for people like him, what he should understand is that he is not defending creativity, he is defending ignorance. He is defending a one-seided traditional view of creativity - which is where the irony of his essay lies. And at the end of the day, the only true creativity is the one that comes out of understanding. That is a creativity a series of pretty pictures can never embody, only the artist, geneticist, programmer, linguist, or even the swimmer (did I mention I'm learning to swim? :) ) So to anyone else who feels a divide between their ""creative arts"" and ""cold logical science"" my advice: learn some science, then you can have an opinion of science. But hopefully after actually peeking in to see what it's about rather than making flawed generalizations based on traditional views of an emerging way of seeing the world, you would have learned a new way of looking at the world.",1362207846

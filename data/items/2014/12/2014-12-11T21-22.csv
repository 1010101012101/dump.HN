What is a person if not a bunch of semi-autonomous systems working together to make decisions and perform actions? What is a company if not the same thing?<p>There are the people who work at Sony. There is Sony as an organization. They are not the same thing, but they can each be described independently. The decisions and actions of a company is a product not of individual humans but of a group of humans working in conjunction to do more than one could do by itself. You can&#x27;t blame the person. That&#x27;s not fair. You have to blame the organization.<p>However, blame is exactly the job role of the executive team, since a company can&#x27;t be fired. You blame Sony.

People often misunderstand the effect of TCMALLOC_MAX_TOTAL_THREAD_CACHE_BYTES ... this environment variable controls the total size of all thread caches in the program, not the size of the cache in each thread.  It defaults to 16MB which is probably about right if you&#x27;re running your database on a 486.

8737281,comment,8729762,8734051,0,0,ChuckMcM,,,"It would be interesting to see if it would go exothermic or not. On the one hand you would suddenly have a bunch of free hydrogen atoms, presumably becoming H2 as they expanded. The pressure wave would be caused by sudden decrease in density (phase shift from solid to gas) but and in the process the new molecules would probably briefly become liquid and then gas. There would not be enough oxygen in the center of that expansion to convert to water, but on the edges of the expanding pressure wave their would be. One possible outcome would be that on the surface of the pressure wave, oxygen would combine with hydrogen to form water, but that water would then insulate the hydrogen behind it from any oxygen, stopping any further reaction. At some point thought he heat going into the phase shift is going to come out of the water, which will force it to freeze, and the as the surface area of the pressure bubble expands, its pressure will decrease until it is in equlibrium with the frozen water&#x27;s surface tension.<p>One possible outcome then is than a conversion would result in a &#x27;pop&#x27;, and the sudden appearance of an ice sphere which is filled with pure hydrogen.",1418335126

They may well have had <i>variable</i> precision, but I don&#x27;t think they had <i>unbounded</i> precision.  That is, there was always a limit such that a result over that limit would either wrap around or trap (I don&#x27;t know which), but that limit could be different for different instructions.  (I&#x27;ll bet there was a hardware-enforced maximum limit too, on the order of 12 or 15 digits.)<p>It wasn&#x27;t until 1969 that Knuth published algorithms for arbitrary-precision arithmetic.  Also consider that arbitrary precision requires heap allocation, which certainly wasn&#x27;t being done <i>in hardware</i> in the 1950s and -60s.<p>If you can substantiate your claim, I&#x27;ll be suitably impressed, but I&#x27;m extremely skeptical.",1418335095

8737260,comment,8733368,8736841,0,0,celticninja,,,"Point 1 - there is no way to reverse a transaction in bitcoin. If you make  mistake you make a mistake. You can request the funds be returned and these things have happened. But let me ask you how often do you send bank payments to the wrong person. Most people will check the details, be it sort code and account number or bitcoin address. Even getting a transaction reversed with a bank is not a simple process and it is not always possible otherwise carders would not be able to withdraw funds successfully because at some point a bank can stop the outflow of money, the difference is the bank takes the loss not you. However when banks take a loss we all take a loss.<p>You don&#x27;t need constant Internet access to use bitcoin. If you have an address for payment you can receive payment to it without being online. Next time you check the address the funds are there.<p>There is recourse to theft, the same ones available to people now, law enforcement. Yes you cannot guarantee the return of funds at present however insurance and insured wallets will be available and in some cases already are. Also security in the area is improving significantly all the time.<p>Western union make about $200 million a year in profits. So it is making a good profit. But transaction fees are high because the infrastructure needed to send payments internationally is extremely entice to build. Or it was before bitcoin came along. People forget that bitcoin is as much about the Blockchain technology as it is the currency. It is the Blockchain that makes transaction fees low and it is one of the primary reasons that bitcoin will &quot;kill it&quot; in the end.",1418334920

They scan the Bluetooth on drivers phones, and time how long it takes for a unique phone to get from one sign to the next. The average of that is the time that gets displayed on the sign.<p>So don&#x27;t worry about your ID being scanned. They already know where you are.

8737202,comment,8685840,8687622,0,0,Alansaccount,,,"Hi Erik,<p>I&#x27;ve been associated with computer chess for a while, and was even given a shout-out by Vas Rajlich for optimization discussion prior to the release of Rybka 3.<p>I think this critic&#x27;s view on the primacy of fast evaluation, at the expense in accuracy is off base. Looking at the two top engines today, Stockfish and Komodo, Stockfish has a great search function, but a poor eval, while Komodo&#x27;s eval is better, but it&#x27;s search isn&#x27;t as good. It&#x27;s pretty clear that bad evaluation is limiting, even at the leaves of a deep search.<p>Anyway, I have more basic questions about why you did what you did. First, it seems that your use of 12 x 64 sets of values to represent state information is non-optimal and even not sufficient. It seems that you are introducing a lot of unnecessary and undesirable additional degrees of freedom by duplicating the piece-square state inputs for white and black. When I&#x27;ve done this in the past, I used 6 x 64 sets with positive ones for squares with a white piece and negative ones for squares with a black piece. Do you see any advantage in not taking advantage of this symmetry?<p>Second, you really need side to move, castling state for each side, and the pesky en passant indicator (just as is required in a FEN representation). Luckily these don&#x27;t significantly increase the number of inputs.<p>I worked on a similar project with a friend at University of Warsaw a number of years back. We generated static evals using FANN based on the complete input state, and trained with the value of the search plus eval after 30 seconds per move We used Rybka 2.2n for this, which was the strongest engine available at the time.<p>We both moved on after some preliminary success, mainly because there wasn&#x27;t any way to conceivably make a top engine due to the closed nature of the top engines at that time. This is no longer an issue, and if someone had a black box evaluation function that produced a better eval than the current Stockfish static eval, it would be trivial to do the substitution.<p>Best Regards,
Alan",1418334069

Of course, they are now discovering that the cost of a really serious hack is much higher than they thought it was.<p>Which makes me wonder if, at some point, we&#x27;re going to have to have some kind of controls on who can legally hold personally identifiable information on their systems and who cannot.

And as a result there&#x27;s a huge volume of critical information out there stored on systems that are either poorly secured or whose admins have decided, like Sony&#x27;s, that the ROI on real security is too poor to justify having any, which creates a target-rich environment for hackers to take advantage of.<p>Attaching serious liability to holding data on systems that aren&#x27;t secured, or requiring proof of competency/minimum-acceptable-effort in order to avoid such, might shift the ROI calculation on security enough to convince even idiots that it&#x27;s worthwhile; or, at least, that it&#x27;s better to outsource holding the data to someone who knows what they&#x27;re doing (and is willing to back that up by accepting liability) than it is to keep everything in-house on a dusty Windows NT4 box under someone&#x27;s desk and just cross their fingers.<p>We already sort of do this sort of thing for financial information, via PCI; but the universe of &quot;data that could do serious damage if it got loose&quot; is much larger than that which PCI covers, as this hack demonstrates.

You can&#x27;t think of &quot;_&quot; like a placeholder. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s to lift an argument of a function.<p>So simplify it: map in this context wants a Function[Int, Int] right? So f(_ * 2) must return a Function[Int,Int]. But it doesn&#x27;t probably. _ is lifting some argument out of whatever f is. If you assume _ is an Int, does f take a <i>Function[Int,Int]</i>? No. It takes an Int. So there&#x27;s no way to parse this that makes sense. It&#x27;s not just &quot;I have a stack of vars, pull one off the stack and bind it every time I write an underscore, reading left to right&quot;. That would be some AST generative grammar hack. That&#x27;s not what the underscore is. It&#x27;s simpler and more consistent than that.<p>What you&#x27;re probably looking for instead is Function Composition. So something like:<p><pre><code>  scala> ary.map(f compose(_ * 2))
  res10: Array[Int] = Array(1, 3, 5)
</code></pre>
So why does that work? Because we were able to compose f() into a larger function that satisfies the signature of the argument map[T](Int => T) requires. A lot like a Stream conceptually.<p>(Is it correct to say in this context f() is a Monad? I&#x27;m not sure, I need to sit down and grok the category stuff sometime...)<p>Or you can write it the long way (calling f inside a new function). But instead of defining &quot;steps&quot; you&#x27;d be creating a new imperative function and driving the stack.",1418332314

They have a website.  They have an iOS app which connects to a web API connected to that database.  They have a designer who makes his 2 (or 3?) designs for each iOS form factor.<p>Then they decide to make an Android app.  The web API is usually OK.  But it becomes decided that the company will ignore that Android&#x27;s come in tablets, very small phones with low resolution, phones with very high resolution, &quot;phablets&quot; etc.  It becomes decided that the goal will be to make a pixel perfect design (just like for the iPhone!) for the Android phone the designer has, and perhaps the other one the boss has, and then to just pretend that the other 99% of the Android market does not exist.<p>There is more Android work then experienced Android programmers, so some inexperienced kid right out of college is the programmer on the project, who is easily intimidated by the designer.  They proceed this way until weeks and months go by and the CEO realizes the app looks like junk on tablets and most phones, and then blames the programmer for this situation.<p>Anyone thinking of stepping into a role as an Android programmer should get everyone on the same page about the UI goals before he agrees to work on the project.  Especially between you and the designer and whoever your common management is, perhaps all the way to the top.  Because the easy way is for the designer to do what he did for iPhone - 2 designs for the 2 phones he has access to, which are pixel perfect (which is completely pointless if it looks like crap on 99% of phones).<p>This situation arises again and again and again.<p>If there&#x27;s any secondary thing, I guess it would be how far back you want to support Android in terms of versions.

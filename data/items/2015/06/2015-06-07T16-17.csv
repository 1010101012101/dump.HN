I&#x27;m not sure that really improves the human condition.<p>I see the problem as the sum of human economic actions creating a structure where <i>only a few people can win and most people must lose</i>. What does it matter if we bump up people&#x27;s IQ? Would that make it so that more people try to apply to be leaders and CEO&#x27;s of tomorrow, when there are so few positions available?<p>Is the lack of meritocracy the principle emotional bother here? Does society become better if it were meritocratic? I don&#x27;t think so. Why not focus on the fact that there&#x27;s a race where only a few people win? Is it because we&#x27;re okay with the current distribution of wealth if we find out that it corresponds with intelligence?<p>All I see from this is a more efficient nation due to better labor allocation, which is an agreeable value, but is that what people wanted to talk about? Economic inefficiency due to bad labor allocation?<p>I think GATTACA shows a meritocratic world. A very meritocratic world. Now, it may be that the movie has some moral message to deliver on &quot;true potential&quot; being more than biology, but that society was largely on target with identifying potential, at least way better than our current world. A few errors now and then sounds very tolerable for a futuristic system, even if it results in a few tragic stories about a denied astronaut with heart problems. I&#x27;m sure they can improve and become even more accurate at identifying aspects of human merit.<p>But in that world, we have corporate dominance of working opportunities, elite rule over inferior biology, a feeling of fate, and shitty jobs -- a world of winners and losers. There will always be more people of merit than there will be jobs of merit. If this last statement is true, what are the implications for the losers of society?",1433696029
9675379,comment,9674286,9675335,0,0,summerdown2,,,"I think the problem is there&#x27;s mathematics on one hand and my experience of the real world on the other. I either didn&#x27;t do any set theory, or I&#x27;ve forgotten it. So it looks just like squiggles on the page to me when I try to understand the maths.<p>So, all I&#x27;m left with is trying to relate what the words might mean in real-world terms. And coming up confused.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s your fault. I just lack the grounding to see both sides of the picture.<p>One thought, though. I&#x27;m not trying to reject it because it offends my sense of reality. I&#x27;m trying to use my sense of reality (which is the only tool I have) to understand it.<p>For example, if someone came up to me at work and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve just worked out how to cut a sphere up into bits and reassemble it as two spheres the same size,&quot; I&#x27;d say, &quot;ok, then, show me.&quot;<p>If all they could do is make marks on paper I couldn&#x27;t understand I&#x27;d think they&#x27;d got the paper wrong, not reality.

9675373,comment,9675043,9675222,0,0,shalmanese,,,"I disagree. I&#x27;ve found in my experience it&#x27;s far easier in theory for a business guy to attract a technology co-founder than the other way around. This insight isn&#x27;t clear from the outside due to a) the existence of &quot;business&quot; guys who do no business and complain vocally and b) the existence of tech+some business guys who know enough business to get their product off the ground and then find a good business guy to balance them out. Every purely tech guy I&#x27;ve seen come to me looking for a co-founder, I&#x27;ve had to tell them I could help you find one but you&#x27;d basically have to throw away all your code and start again from scratch. For the tech guys for which their code is their baby, this is not a welcome message and they instead go find someone else to tell them how they&#x27;ve made the best mousetrap in the world.<p>Here&#x27;s how to be a non-technical co-founder that makes tech guys excited and willing to hop on board:<p>* Articulate a vision that&#x27;s broad, compelling and unique. Filter tech guys by the ones who are already excited by that vision rather than trying to convince them away from their pet cause.<p>* Become so educated in the field that you can confidently answer any of the tech guy&#x27;s questions and that you can educate and provide insight into the field from the very start of the conversation.<p>* Talk to customers, find ones for who this is a hair on fire problem, take a short video of those customers explaining their needs and edit it down to a short sizzle reel.<p>* Create a landing page, put in a field for explaining why leads are signing up, demonstrate to the tech guy that you&#x27;re not just capturing random email addresses but passionate fans.<p>* Use that same landing page to A/B test pitches, show data on how you can hone product/market fit via experimentation.<p>* Get signed Letters of Intent from businesses detailing what their purchase commitments are willing to be if a set of well defined features were to be built.<p>* Map out a series of go-to market strategies, research the pros and cons of each one, demonstrate you have some unique insights or resources that would give your startup an unfair advantage.<p>* Build out an early front end prototype using non-technical tools. Have it hooked into a completely human powered backend (it&#x27;s surprising how far you can get with just SMS for example, or email), run the entire system yourself to better understand the user&#x27;s needs. Show how a small piece of technology could immediately super charge both the quality and scalability of the operation.<p>* Go out and raise money contingent on finding a co-founder and search for co-founders contingent on raising money. Both groups are risk averse and like to see validation. Providing the mutual validation gets both to hop on board at the same time.<p>* Learn programming in your spare time using free tools. Demonstrate to your tech cofounder that you&#x27;re committed to understanding where they are coming from and respect the work they do.<p>* Help everyone you can in your local community. Offer advice, intros, free work (but not too much) and be known as the connector and who everyone needs to know. Follow up with people on a regular interval and ask how they&#x27;re going and see if there&#x27;s anything they need help with that you&#x27;re uniquely suited to do. At the same time, be cynically strategic about this. Like hangs out with like and you eventually get connected with higher ability tiers of people if you demonstrate the value you can bring. Find people slightly above your talent range and deliver the world to their plate. Skill up and repeat.<p>* Just, in general, be a nice person and someone people want to work with. There&#x27;s many different shades of nice and you also have to be someone authentic to your personality. Don&#x27;t be afraid to be polarizing, I&#x27;m personally the &quot;asshole nice&quot; person in person and that turns quite a few people off but the ones who it clicks with, we click really well.<p>In general, when I meet a non-business co-founder who&#x27;s in the process of trying to get something started, I advise them not even to start looking for a technical co-founder yet. You can get so much done nowadays without touching technology and the class of people you&#x27;re able to attract exponentially increases the further along you are. The people who get excited about hearing this message, I pay attention to more and try to help in any way. The people who balk at this, I can&#x27;t see them ever getting far.<p>edit: Another psychological factor that makes a huge difference is shifting from what I call a &quot;scarcity&quot; mindset to an &quot;abundance&quot; mindset because scarcity attracts scarcity and abundance attracts abundance.<p>For example, it&#x27;s immensely frustrating to me when I meet people who are job hunting and I ask them what they&#x27;re after and they reply with some version of &quot;Oh, I could really work anywhere&quot;. The reason they say that is because they think any job is better than no job and better to be overly broad so as to not miss out on any opportunities. In actuality, it&#x27;s the opposite, telling me you could work anywhere means I can&#x27;t find anything for you.<p>Instead, where I can really add value is if you outline a set of broad theses about what you&#x27;re excited about and I can suggest companies working towards those aims I know people at. During the course of that conversation, other areas of interest or other companies come up and by the end, there&#x27;s usually 3 or 4 very strong intros I can send. The reason why these people are successful is because they are in an abundance mindset where they feel like they could work at a lot of places and are really more concerned about finding the right place for them and they&#x27;re willing to be polarizing to do it.<p>For job hunters, especially junior ones, I&#x27;m willing to go through the work of shifting them from a scarcity mindset to an abundance one and help them when networking with other people in the future. If you&#x27;re at the co-founder stage though and you&#x27;re still in the scarcity mindset, I have no sympathy for you and I&#x27;ll just politely disengage.",1433695964

I do consulting, I do products and I do training too. Products make 2-3x Consulting revenue. If I pushed it, it would go much higher than that.<p>However, I just like my job. I like consulting. I like solving problems for businesses. I like it much more than building a full scale business for myself, actually.<p>What I want to say is this: If you&#x27;re a consultant and want to scale, you won&#x27;t be doing what you&#x27;re doing now. You will be running a business. If you do software deelopment, you won&#x27;t be doing any of that any more. You will be figuring how to hire people, how to train them, how to retain them, how to get them work, deal with accounting and a million other things.<p>Another thing to think about is competition. When you&#x27;re a solo operation, competition is not a problem. When you grow a company, however, it becomes a big problem. Not only direct competition. Indirect one too. Take for example PPC (pay-per-click) agencies. Firms offering search engine optimization started offering PPC, so the ones specializing in PPC had to start offering SEO too. Then SEO became all about web development and now those firms had to compete with web dev shops. Hire, train, retain people for that? Then traditional ad agencies started getting into digital too and they have a lot of other expertise to offer.<p>Growing a business is like taking a life-long trip without knowing the destination and you might be very unpleasantly surprised at the end.",1433695769

Consider that the read-side has few to none atomic operations on the fast path, and if so, is typically on exclusively written memory and it does not block in any fashion. This means readers scale and are very fast. You might enjoy the paper I linked to which exposes some of the performance characteristics (it isn&#x27;t exhaustive, it doesn&#x27;t explore real-world implications on memory usage as update frequency increases, for example, but it&#x27;s a great start).

So at the risk of karma, I am posting.<p>In the history of the US there has never been a time where it is easier to take on debt. There has been so much tampering with the natural order of the financial system that many natural checks and balances have been altered, levitated, and in some cases nearly removed.<p>Please bear with me here, this is not an anti-government screed.<p>In 2007, per Federal Reserve Flow of Funds; Household Debt to Disposable Income reached 138%. There are also many other data points that show that since around 2006 we reached economic outlier territory. For comparison, in 1964 this number was just over 65%, and in 1991 was just over 80%. So it kind of went up like a rocket.<p>Their information shows some normalization since 2009, but there is grey area there as they began adjusting their methods of measurement when they varied so far out of norm (in their defense this is what any good statistician would do).<p>Even if you have no doubt in those measurements though there is a solid area of outlier in almost every financial measurement of activity since ~2006.<p>This was actually the Fed Reserve goal, so they were successful in what they set out to do.<p>The issue is that money is inextricably tied to national and individual personality. There will be knock-on effects there, and those aren&#x27;t or can&#x27;t be measured.<p>In summary, and reaching my point, I would say that this person was one of many victims that the Fed knows will occur on the way, while making things overall better for the many. His personal response to that event is also IMHO normal. I would do it myself if I could (I have over 80k in student debt).<p>That said, in all economic measurements, there is no account for changes in attitudes towards bankruptcy. In fact, bankruptcies are considered a static number in financial equations, X per year, with some variance as the availability of borrowed funds increases.<p>Therein lies the rub. It is really not possible, or at least extremely difficult, to account for knock on effects that may be deleterious to attitudes. I would suppose this is why they don&#x27;t include those; they are either considered side cases and too small to account for or like in the case of attitudes towards bankruptcy, not possible to measure.<p>It is perfectly reasonable to fix things that seem broken. It is not realistic though to make changes in vital things like money with measurements taken in a vacuum. Particularly in things so deeply tied to attitudes and personality.<p>Final words, if you can&#x27;t measure it but you still know it&#x27;s there, you must make sure you do not affect it.

In a billion years, the Earth will be swallowed up by the Sun&#x27;s expanding size, and certainly will be obliterated when the Sun goes Super Nova. It&#x27;s nice to think this won&#x27;t obliterate the human species!<p>However, you ask a good question -- and one related to the 5 Whys: why do we want the human species to survive permanently? And are we just extending the timeline of an inevitable demise? This leads me to think about the heat death of the universe and then I get depressed. :)<p>In terms of social inequality and immobility, here we go:<p>Why #1: extreme social immobility and inequality often destabilizes a society. This is why I&#x27;d consider it a problem/threat. At the very least, many economists argue that social inequality slow down the rate of innovation and economic growth.<p>Why #2: when you look at Western capitalist societies there appears to be a strong correlation between social mobility and access to opportunities (e.g., education, health care, etc.) and a society&#x27;s ability to innovate. Note that &quot;innovation&quot; here refers to the society being able to solve other problems affecting said society. In a sense, social inequality and immobility stifle innovation and thus, it is &quot;meta-problem&quot; -- it makes it difficult to solve other problems the society is facing.<p>Why #3: a lot of literature (in management theory, education theory, etc.) argues that giving people the ability to grow, develop, learn, etc. makes them more productive, creative, and better able to solve problems. Social immobility and inequality is a form of oppression, in this regard.<p>Why #4: this sort of mobility ultimately aligns incentives -- you are encouraged to be creative, solve important problems, etc. that are valuable for society because doing so will enable you to enrich yourself.<p>Why #5: because humans need incentives to succeed, and human ingenuity is something that need to be cultivated.<p>TL,DR: social inequality and immobility is a meta-problem because (a) it makes society unstable and leads to the other issues we are worried about, and (b) reduces humanity&#x27;s ability to innovate and thus solve other problems.",1433693738

I&#x27;ve seen many who type with what looks like far more force than necessary, and it could be related to the fact that a lot of keyboards require high actuation forces and have a sharp force-profile. That makes the hands tense, which reduces accuracy and speed, and the instinctive reaction is to stiffen the hands even more, making it worse. If you want to type faster, you should relax.<p>Typing shouldn&#x27;t hurt, and even when I&#x27;m typing really quickly (I average in the 140-150wpm range, with bursts over 200) my fingers feel like they&#x27;re bouncing over the keys instead of being forced into pecking at them.

Harks back to the good old days of William F. Buckley and the old days of the National Review.<p>Unfortunately, the author is more interested in the manifestation/justification of his own values (arch politeness; nihilistic stoicism; the existence of a strictly bipolar culture war between noble, truthful conservatives and misguided communists who are living a lie) than the topic at hand, so we don&#x27;t get to hear as much of his thinking on the matter as we might like to.<p>He points out that there are tactical and strategic dimensions to this sort of incident, and that there there are individuals and groups who actively pursue this kind of power;  he correctly, I think, identifies this as a general problem that needs to be dealt with more determinedly and in a more professional manner than &quot;now look, we don&#x27;t want no trouble, here...&quot;<p>However, he gets bogged down in a threat analysis that really only needed to go as far as the word &quot;careers.&quot;  There are indeed individuals for whom this sort of disputation is a career, or at least vocation, regardless of how cynical or innocent their intentions may be.  One needs to fear professional revolutionaries;  an inquiry into the nature of the revolution misses the point.<p>I vaguely recall the name Mencius Moldbug as being that of an absolute loon;  he may well believe a great many things that are directly or by consequence very ugly.  The author is likewise someone I would (having read a few of his essays) personally describe as deluded.  However, I think that someone needs to make the argument that this sort of influence-leveraging is ethically wrong.  It is disappointing that the author explicitly shrugs off the notion... the truth, or ethics, or whatever is just and good in his mind:  these are matters internal to conservatism, it would seem.<p>I am not sure that it <i>is</i>, in fact ethically wrong.  I don&#x27;t know.  But I think it needs explicit, public justification on the part of at least a few of those &quot;large number of current and former speakers&quot; who allegedly put such widespread pressure on the conference organizers.  Such a thing requires justification in every case, as does all public censure, for the same reasons that (for instance) a system of laws ought require justification for a penalty:  otherwise, the ability to coordinate and provoke censure becomes a means to power and an end in itself.",1433693316

So perhaps start with <i>The Chomsky Reader</i>.  An easier-to-digest intro is the documentary <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>. The twist is that a lot of the things you think of as &quot;bugs&quot; in the political and economic systems of the Western democracies are &quot;features&quot; from the perspective of powerful elites. But the meta-lesson is that big questions can be answered. If you get past the mythology in your culture, and read primary sources, you can really figure this stuff out. Chomsky can go off the deep end at times (and his fanclub does so a lot), but his documentation is meticulous. Well worth reading.<p>For very different perspectives on programming, check out <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programming</i> (read it a decade ago and I use techniques from there every day.)<p><i>The Gift</i> by Lewis Hyde. Although directed at artists, it is highly relevant to creative programmers and the phenomenon of open source. He is able to articulate things which are very hard to talk about, like the intersection of economics and artistry, and how the gifting ethos is necessary for any culture to thrive. If you think ESR had the last word on how open source works, you need to read this.<p>Another book of interest by Hyde is <i>Trickster Makes This World</i>, wherein you learn the hacker archetype - the giver of technology; the player of tricks - has been around since prehistory.

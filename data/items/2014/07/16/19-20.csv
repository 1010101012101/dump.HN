8044169,comment,8036716,8040752,1,0,MichaelGG,,,"The sample looks like any other closure-based framework, to me. Compare to C#, for instance, I can just do this:<p><pre><code>  try { \n    var a = await Function1Async()\n    var b = await Function2Async(a);\n    try {\n      var c = nonAsync(a,b);\n      await AnotherThingAsync(c);\n    } catch { ... }\n  } catch { \n    ...\n  }\n  finally {\n    ...\n  } \n</code></pre>\nThis generates the callback mess (every await is an async call), figures out the right parts of the exception/finally handlers to run, etc. etc. I don&#x27;t see how this can be remotely approached if the only syntax you have is lambdas. You need some sort of rewriting system, either by a special keyword (C#), or monad-like thing (F# workflows) or something.",1405540785
8044168,comment,8043655,8043891,2,0,orbifold,,,"One instance would be function composition. If functions are values in your language, you can define function composition in the language, that is given a function f : a -> b and g : b -> c, you can define their composition g . f : a -> c as<p>g . f = \\x -> g(f(x))<p>(Here \\ denotes lambda)<p>Why would it be useful to have function composition in your language? Well it gives you similar power as &quot;method chains&quot; in an object oriented language, without being tied to specific classes, especially if the language also supports polymorphic functions. It also interacts nicely with other abstractions usually found in functional languages: For example consider map, of Map-Reduce fame<p>map : (Functor f) => (a -> b) -> (f a -> f b)<p>then one has<p>map (g . f) = map g . map f<p>Now imagine that map would cause the function to be send to thousands of nodes in a cluster, then the above identity tells you that instead of doing that twice, once for f and once for g, you might aswell take g . f and send it out once. Also say you would for some reason know that f . g = id, the identity function, then<p>map id = id,<p>so you would not need to do anything. This might appear trivial, but if you can teach the compiler about those cases, you can do interesting stuff with it. In the case of GHC (the Glasgow Haskell Compiler), it is able to use such rules in its optimization phase, which allows people to write apparently inefficient but declarative code and let the compiler eliminate intermediate values. See for example <a href=""https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa</a>.",1405540780

A democratic government has to care about elections. A private company has no such concerns.</i><p>Of course, it&#x27;s the first reaction to say &quot;but your private protection agencies are going to turn into de-facto governments&quot;. If you think long enough about it, you understand that they won&#x27;t. Violence is never profitable unless somebody else pays for it (as with the government). Private protection agencies are in the business to make money long term, just like every other business. And that is only possible if you produce something people truly want.<p>So, two things as incentives to not rob you. 1. Your future business - if they rob you they, obviously, aren&#x27;t going to get your business in the future. 2. Competition. Those two things government doesn&#x27;t have to worry about!

You cannot just say &quot;no, no, thank you, but I prefer to keep my money and not use these and these services or fund these wars&quot;. You still have to give politicians power first. And you still use government power to make other people pay for what the majority considers a good idea. I think this principle of majority is rather insane. A simple test: if tomorrow the majority decided to shoot all redheads, if you followed your principle, you&#x27;d have to agree.<p><i>>Indeed, so in a completely capitalist system, your freedom is contingent on the amount of capital you have.

When you say &quot;some freedoms should be guaranteed&quot; you probably mean &quot;some services&quot;, which is different. Freedom is not the product of someone else&#x27;s labor. It simply is inaction, when you don&#x27;t tell other people how to live their lives and how to spend their money.

8044093,comment,8043655,8043888,29,0,seliopou,,,"I&#x27;ve used Haskell to build JavaScript tools and analyses[0], among other things[1], and have been using OCaml for the past nine months to develop a software-defined networking controller called frenetic[2]. Off the top of my head, here are a few areas where OCaml has an edge on Haskell:<p>1. The module system. OCaml&#x27;s module system is a language in and of itself. It not only allows you to define modules that export certain identifiers and types, it also allows you to write functors, which are essentially functions in the module language that can take a module as an argument and produce a new module as a result. This is a great way of reusing code in a project as well as defining external APIs in a general but natural way. OCaml&#x27;s module system the closest I&#x27;ve seen to realizing the dream of building software by taking some modules from here or there and composing them together.<p>2. Mutation. Unlike Haskell, OCaml allows mutation. Specifically, OCaml allows value mutation in certain contexts, while both Haskell and OCaml do not allow variable mutation. What this means is that in both languages, if you have an identifier, you cannot change the value that the identifier points to; you can only shadow the identifier with a new binding. But in OCaml, you can declare certain fields of your types to be mutable. You can also wrap values in a &quot;box&quot; which allows you get the same feel that you would out of variable mutation. While in general it&#x27;s a good idea to limit your use of mutation, sometimes you know it&#x27;s ok and you just want to do it. OCaml lets you do that, but it requires you to be explicit about it rather than just letting you do it willy-nilly.<p>3. gdb-able. If you know how to use gdb (and even valgrind I believe), you can use it to debug your OCaml programs. If you try and use these tools with Haskell, you will get nothing but nonsense until you learn how to read the matrix. This fact by itself for some people will make OCaml a candidate for systems programming over Haskell.<p>4. Subtyping. Certain features of OCaml&#x27;s type system allow you to do subtyping, complete with type variable annotations to indicate covariance or contravariance. This is a feature that Haskell&#x27;s type system does not have, so in a sense this is a strength of OCaml. However in my experience, this feature of the type system is hard to use and reason about, and I&#x27;ve seen little (maybe no?) code in the wild that takes advantage of it, with the exception of some simple inference the type system can do in this respect related to polymorphic variants[3].<p>All that being said, Haskell&#x27;s still my hobby language of choice. But for building real systems, I&#x27;m warming to idea of OCaml as a viable candidate language.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/plt/dl/adsafety/v1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.brown.edu/research/plt/dl/adsafety/v1/</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/seliopou/typo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/seliopou/typo</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/frenetic-lang/frenetic</a><p>[3]: <a href=""https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html#polymorphic-variants"" rel=""nofollow"">https://realworldocaml.org/v1/en/html/variants.html#polymorp...</a>",1405540122

In 2009, the College dropped its speech codes and became one of the most free-speech-friendly schools in the US. This has its ups and downs (in my opinion, mostly ups).<p>We have a fairly diverse studentry, but I haven&#x27;t seen that many people with incredibly strong opinions. Most people (myself included) don&#x27;t really regularly say or do things that  would fall under PC speech codes. That said, I do know a few activist types, and they relish the freedom they have at the College. I&#x27;ve known people who go to DC to participate in protests on the weekends, people who write articles on why the &quot;government has failed its mandate to protect our right to privacy&quot; or &quot;how the liberal media uses misleading language to paint climate change as something that&#x27;s actually happening&quot; (obviously different people). We&#x27;ve got EFF activists, marijuana legalization activists, sexual health activists, hard-line family-values conservatives -- basically, what should be the regular college gamut. It&#x27;s a shame that appears to be contingent on a free-speech policy that is relatively extreme.<p>Free speech also has its downsides. Earlier this year, we made state and national news when a fraternity member distributed this extremely misogynistic letter, that various headlines describe as &quot;The most hideous thing I&#x27;ve ever read&quot;[1] and &quot;vomit-inducing&quot;[2]. We drew censures from practically everyone, and many people I talked to around that time wanted the College to boot the offending fraternity. The College, of course, did no such thing, and the fraternity voluntarily suspended operations (there could have been some under-the-table coercion there, but I  doubt it).<p>Anyway, the point is, if colleges allow free speech, they must also stand by while some vile, vile things get published. All communities result in emergent standards of discourse and systems of self-governance when those standards are violated (after all, the backlash from that letter was strongest in the student community), and these systems dull the effects of those vile things, but they affect the community regardless. I personally think the benefits outweigh the costs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bustle.com/articles/14437-sigma-chi-frat-brothers-save-the-sluts-email-is-the-most-hideous-thing-ive-ever-read"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bustle.com/articles/14437-sigma-chi-frat-brothers...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/fraternity-brother-email-william-and-mary_n_4688160.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/29/fraternity-brother-...</a>",1405539579

8043994,comment,8042673,8043055,20,0,wetmore,,,"tl;dr If, for each angle of the sun, you want some object to have a particular shadow, that object exists.<p>The theorem says something like this: imagine you have a 2D plane, with the usual x and y axes. For any θ between 0 and pi, there is a unique line passing through the origin. That&#x27;s L_θ [1]. Now for each line, say we pick out some subset of the line, called G_θ [2]. In the picture I&#x27;ve made G_θ thicker for emphasis, but if you think of the whole line as a bunch of points, then G_θ is just some of those points. So for each θ, we have a line, and a corresponding subset of the line. If we add all the lines together we get the entire 2D plane, and if we add all the G_θ&#x27;s together we get some set of points in that plane. The important condition in the theorem that needs to hold for the results to be true is that if we add all the G_θ&#x27;s together, we get a set which we can say has some area.<p>Now proj_θ F is sort of like the &quot;shadow&quot; of F on L_θ, for some set F. See this picture [3]. The perpendicular projection takes a 2D set and projects it onto a 1D set (the line). Analagously, if the sun was in the sky above your head and you were standing on a 2D plane, then your shadow would be the perpendicular projection of a 3D set (you) onto a 2D set (the ground).<p>Anyway, if we add all the G_θ&#x27;s together and get some set which is suitably &quot;nice&quot;, then there is some other 2D set F such that if we project F onto any* line L_θ, the &quot;shadow&quot; on L_θ covers G_θ completely, and the part of the shadow that isn&#x27;t covering G_θ is negligibly small [4].

It&#x27;s not super powerful, but it made me happy because it turned what would have been a good 30 minutes to refactor and re-test into a quick 1 minute task.<p>I had written a synchronous interface for some functionality, that had quite a bit of input data. It called an external web api twice, once to post some data, then a recursive check to periodically ping the API until some changes took effect (yes, none of this was ideal, but I couldn&#x27;t change the API).<p>I later realized that the code calling this interface needed to do some work in between these two calls. To refactor it into two calls would be a lot of work, and require a lot of book keeping, passing variables around or recalculating them, etc, and bloat the code.<p>Instead, I just wrapped the second call in a closure, changing the interface; now rather than returning the result of that second function, it just returned that second function, which the calling code could invoke after it did its work.<p>That is, I went from<p><pre><code>  calling_func() ->\n    Val = interface();\n    ...\n\n  interface() -> \n    ...//Do stuff to calculate vars\n    do_work1();\n    do_work2(Var1, Var2, ...);\n</code></pre>\nto<p><pre><code>  calling_func() ->\n    SynchFunc = interface();\n    ...//Do whatever needs to happen between the two calls\n    Val = SynchFunc();\n    ...\n\n  interface() -> \n    ...//Do stuff to calculate vars\n    do_work1();\n    fun() -> do_work2(Var1, Var2, ...) end;</code></pre>",1405538834

Even in the demo some of the pictures are cropped badly, and I could not figure out how to adjust them.<p>Yes, there are a few ways to reposition photos. If you click on a photo, you can pan and zoom it in the photo slot. If you don&#x27;t like where the photo is, you can swap its position with another on the page by dragging it. If you don&#x27;t like the layout, you can hit &quot;Change Layout&quot; and get a different layout.<p>As a side note, you can also add and remove a photo from a page. To remove, click on a photo on the page, there should be a red button in the top right of the photo slot. To add a photo, simply drag it from the photo tray to the &quot;Add to Page&quot; drop target.<p>> 2. It states &quot;It will be same price no matter how many pages or photos you have.&quot; -- is that &quot;as long as you don&#x27;t go over 120? So..The &quot;Large&quot; book is $1 per photo? How do you differentiate from other book makers that are much less expensive?<p>Yes, Montage currently supports a maximum of 120 photos. This will yield a book that is roughly 50 pages. The closest products in the market may have layflat pages, but don&#x27;t mirror Montage&#x27;s unique design and quality materials, which was a massive R&D effort in and of itself. And even then, these competitors base prices start at 20 pages, only to increase once you get to checkout.<p>In short, when you compare apples to apples, Montage gives you a higher quality product in half the time for a similar price.<p>> 3. Is there no crop, rotate, rearrange or ANY kind of adjustment to the photos in the book? There is no way on earth I would pay $119 for a book that I couldn&#x27;t tune. Your &quot;automagic layout&quot; didn&#x27;t get it right for me at all.<p>See #1. Give the editor a shot in test drive mode and you&#x27;ll see that you can actually control the magic. :)<p>> 4. How are the books bound? I don&#x27;t know what lay-flat binding means. Are they glued, sewn? How do I know that in a year the pages aren&#x27;t going to fall out?<p>All Montages are layflat which means there is no crease in the middle. This really allows your photos to shine. We use industrial strength glue to ensure the book will last for generations. We stand behind our product with a 90 day no question asked return policy.",1405538816

VCs correctly care about value, not revenue or profit, but by itself this isn&#x27;t a problem because the few most valuable companies typically dominate the returns, and they are virtually always insanely profitable in the long run. VCs thus don&#x27;t deserve derision for not caring about revenue or profit in the short term.<p>On the other hand, because only the top few companies matter to a VC&#x27;s returns, the VC&#x27;s incentives are not always well-aligned with the interests of the founders. This is because VCs can invest in a large number of companies and thus realize the expected value of their investments (due to the law of large numbers [2]). Founders, on the other hand, even if they are insanely prolific, can probably only start a handful of companies in a lifetime, and are thus exposed to a much higher variance in outcomes.<p>For example, if the founders have a choice between a 50% chance of making a $50m company (expected value $25m) and a 1% chance of making a $10b company (expected value $100m), VCs have a strong incentive to push for the latter, even though most founders would prefer the former.  This mismatch of incentives, <i>not</i> a lack of focus on revenue or profit, is the real problem with VC (at least from a founder&#x27;s point of view).<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers</a>",1405538523

In our problem, we must regard the desires and needs of the individual human being who wants to speak and those of the great group of human beings among whom he speaks. That is, in technical language, there are individual interests and social interests, which must be balanced against each other, if they conflict, in order to determine which interest shall be sacrificed under the circumstances and which shall be protected and become the foundation of a legal right.&quot; It must never be forgotten that the balancing cannot be properly done unless all the interests involved are adequately ascertained, and the great evil of all this talk about rights is that each side is so busy denying the other&#x27;s claim to rights that it entirely overlooks the human desires and needs behind that claim.&quot;<p>You have a free speech right that extends to every corner of the country. Others, however, also have rights. A balance must be sought, and to strike a fair balance you have to look at what is reasonable not from a law perspective but from a be-a-goddamn-human-being perspective.<p>Is it a balance to restrict freedom of speech rights on a college campus except to limited areas? No. Because the purpose of a college is to increase knowledge, and the campus is semi-public. It is reasonable to expect someone wishing to speak to you about an issue to back off if you tell them you&#x27;re not interested, but it&#x27;s not reasonable to proactively prevent them from doing so. And it is reasonable to expect them to stay out of your house (property rights), but not, for instance, reasonable for them to be proactively banned from knocking on your door to see if you are interested (though as an individual you can proactively indicate you are not interested by posting to that effect, putting up a gate, etc).<p>But I assume you know that and are just being contrary for the sake of it.",1405537731

8043870,comment,8042526,8043234,1,0,davidp,,,"> for true long-term support, with support meaning=capability of debugging issues in-house for all the core stack they release<p>Your definition of support doesn&#x27;t match that used by enterprises like Spotify, i.e. the ones with real money on the line.  They don&#x27;t care whether the debugging is in-house or elsewhere; they just want the problem solved, and they want someone they can call who will go solve it.  That involves paying someone directly (Canonical or other support companies), indirectly (paying your own employees to learn and manage things), or both.  I&#x27;m guessing the ecosystem thing is in play here -- it&#x27;s just easier to find Ubuntu-competent people/firms than Debian-competent ones.<p>That said, the work done by the Debian team is very valuable (thank you), which it seems ought at some level be reflected economically.  I have no familiarity with Debian&#x27;s financial situation but the hosting and compute resources can&#x27;t come for free.  A reasonable business model might be for the Debian team, or a commercial branch or spinoff thereof, or even just some motivated entrepreneurs, to serve as a (potentially non-profit) service provider for the likes of Canonical.  Seems like a natural evolution to me, but as I said I&#x27;m not familiar with Debian&#x27;s economics.<p>> If the package you&#x27;re having problems with is an old release that is not maintained anymore upstream<p>Wouldn&#x27;t Debian suffer the same problem here, e.g. if some piece of software&#x27;s maintainer gets hit by a bus?  Or does Debian make the commitment to take &quot;ownership&quot;, if necessary, of all the software it bundles?  The latter seems logistically challenging but I am prepared to be (even more) impressed.",1405537448

8043860,comment,8043393,8043703,5,0,pdabbadabba,,,"The short answer is that the Supreme Court has held that restricting protests to particular places on campus is a reasonable &quot;time, place, and manner&quot; restriction, so long as the regulation leaves open some reasonable place for protests and does not discriminate on the basis of the protesters&#x27; message. (This is based on the dubious, but now legally established, principle that &quot;protesting&quot; is a mode of speech and not also a message. Some on the court would have held -- right, I think -- that a law that discriminates against protestors inherently discriminates between speakers&#x27; viewpoints.)

On the one hand, any school (or other organization) operated by a state is also subject to the federal constitution including the First Amendment (of course, this does not cover private schools). And on the other hand, I think your logic stretches too far: I reserve the right to kick you out of my dinner party because I don&#x27;t like what you&#x27;re saying. I receive &quot;federal funds&quot; in the form of various tax breaks. If I do actually kick you out, have I violated the First Amendment? I hope not.<p>The usual rule is that only the government itself (at any level -- or its agents, under certain circumstances) can violate the First Amendment (and almost all of the other amendments, with the notable exception of the 13th).

From one perspective, if the known fixed functionality of the brain is implemented in part using DNA mutations, this is good long-term news - after all, if there is <i>one</i> thing you can expect to be kept intact and be recoverable in a vitrified brain, it&#x27;s the DNA.

Migrating a solution to a new form factor because it has been succesful in the past or because there is a sulerficial similarity rarely ends up being a good design decision. Often when it works it is not at all for the reasons one initially presumed.<p>UX is all about matching intuitive user behavior with a solutions feature set as naturally as possible. The free vs fee problem is more similiar to this that on initial inspection. How does the user behave when coming across a web site which, as a part of its feature set, requires a transaction prior to proceeding with the use case?<p>To say that micropayments categorically won’t work is to equate the Internet with a homogeneous payment network. Sure, it’s been huge for commerce, but that isn’t what the internet is, at all. The analogy doesn’t carry. Micropayments are already working in some cases. This is exactly what Spotify is. User pays Spotify. User listens to tons of random songs. User pays Spotify. Spotify pays artists/corps pro rata. Sometimes a penny here, a nickel there. Kinda like, micropayments. Spotify seems to be doing ok. The artists, that’s another story.<p>The Internet is not one thing. The Internet it more than the sum of its physically parts. It will have many solutions.<p>I wish one-size-fits-all solutions would stop being put proposed. It’s exactly what the Internet isn’t.

My degree is in Mechanical Engineering, but I taught myself programming at age 7 on an old TRS-80 and have basically only worked in computing my whole life.<p>At Daimler, I worked on the computer vision system, doubling the throughput (by adding more processing nodes primarily). IIRC, we went from ~12.5 Hz to about 25Hz. That was fairly straightforward, but I also added a lot of inter-frame aware filtering, created some graphical output changes to help us better understand what the system was doing internally at any given time. That was all in Occam on transputers. I think each card held two nodes and cost about $25K. Each node was about a 486-25.<p>We had a couple mile stretch of abandoned Autobahn a few miles away from our lab building that we would test on about once a week. (Other teams also needed the vehicle to test their systems.) We also took it to an abandoned airfield outside Munich for longer, higher-speed tests, and demos, and took it to Turin a few times for tests and pan-PROMETHEUS demos and world record runs. On a few of those test sessions, if our system was working well, I was also able to pitch in with other teams on control system algorithms, a radar ranging system, and lane/sign detection vision system work.<p>(This is all 23+ years old, so forgive some minor discrepancies.) It was a great experience all around!

I wish I had that guy&#x27;s name and address as it was great advice.<p>Went to a few startups that failed, went to a motorsports simulation game company that was successful and bought by Sierra-Online, then went to a satellite office of DEShaw (a hedge fund), bounced around in finance, and finally ended up at Vistaprint a few years before we went public in 2005 and I&#x27;m still there and crazy happy.<p>I welcome any followup questions (for HN sake, followups on your former question are more interesting than the latter, but I&#x27;ll answer either...)",1444060363

Or would design their cars in such a way as to allow the brakes to be tampered with over an open internet connection? Or would willingly allow cars on the market with a fatal mechanical flaw, because the calculus tells them paying out death settlements would cost less than a recall and redesign? Auto manufacturers consider the cost of human life and breaking the law as a matter of course, and there is always an acceptable amount of death and illegality they&#x27;re willing to risk.<p>Nothing about this scenario requires autonomous cars anyway. They could already be packed with cameras, and streaming panoramic video to the police, yet they aren&#x27;t.

Since the incremental costs of producing additional copies of physical objects are so high, it&#x27;s easy to absorb design costs into the price paid for each copy, but for digital objects this makes much less sense.<p>I am advocating a humanitarian system of patronage of the arts, yes. I think it&#x27;s worthwhile to have faith in the ability of people to self-actualize when their basic needs are met, and I&#x27;m hoping we can thereby support creative endeavors of modest scale, like writing articles for the Web.

I could point you (in private) to at least two companies (big on my country&#x27;s market in their particular segments) I know personally cheat and steal, including lying on the phone to people who have managed to figure out the deception and called in to complain. One of those companies has figured out a strategy to stay on top of user complains so that they&#x27;re free to do whatever they want. The other one has their office in a low-population region and is the one of the few available employers for the locals - this allows the CEO to both abuse the employees and to avoid scrutiny by keeping the local work inspector bribed.<p>On top of that, it&#x27;s an open secret that food stores do shit like cleaning stale meat with dish liquid and then selling it to people as fresh.

For drugs covered by patent, Medicare should negotiate a price based on differential Quality adjusted life year, with the price per quality adjusted life year set by law.

Pet&#x27;s (dogs and cats) manure must be composted first.<p>There are 2 plausible reasons why this may be so. The first is that large farm herbivore&#x27;s (cows and horses mostly) are different enough from human beings that the diseases they carry cannot cross the species barriers so easily, not so with pets. Composting kills bacteria in at least 2 ways: it heats up and all but the thermophilic bacteria get killed, and competition from sturdier aerobic non-pathogenic bacteria in the compost pile drive off the rest after a couple dozen generations. This is specially important for dogs since we have been co-evolving to eat roughly the same foodstuffs for a couple million years. But I really don&#x27;t see much of the same concerns for cats.<p>The other idea is that cat&#x27;s feces are what gardeners call &quot;hot&quot; themselves. It has nothing to do with temperature, but with overly high nitrogen contents. I don&#x27;t have a reference at hand, but the basics of compost chemistry say that nitrogen based substances react and break down cellulose in the plant derived parts of the compost pile, making the carbon in it usable by the lifeforms in the soil. This has the side effect of coupling the toxic nitro in the catalyst (urine and feces) with carbon atoms, changing it into non-toxic forms that are themselves usable by the lifeforms in the soil as well.",1444057879

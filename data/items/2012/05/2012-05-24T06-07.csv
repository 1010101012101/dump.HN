For instance, Christianity contains both the Anabaptist republic of Thomas Muenzer and the Spanish Inquisition.  These can be classified as left and right extremes just as easily as Stalin and Hitler.<p>Left-right polarity is also seen in historical Islam (9/11 is not a product of Islam, but of Western revolutionary nationalism with a thin Islamic veneer), as well as even more divergent histories (eg, classical Korea).  I have no doubt that if there are intelligent, gregarious aliens anywhere in the galaxy, they divide themselves into revolutionaries and conservatives.<p>There are only three ways of ruling a country.  Aristotle, who had access to the histories of hundreds if not thousands of classical city-states whose annals are now of course lost, described them: monarchy, aristocracy, democracy.<p>Monarchy is the null hypothesis.  The vast majority of historical governments have been primarily monarchical, often with some admixture of aristocracy.  Pure aristocracy is much rarer.  Democracy is difficult to even define (most nominal democracies, certainly including ours, are in fact aristocratic), extremely rare if it does exist, and commonly associated (as in the Greek case) with national if not civilizational decay in the near future.<p>An example of thinking about causality would be the French decision to cede Saint-Domingue its independence.  Critics (inherently conservative) of this decision would postulate one kind of future for the new Haiti; proponents (inherently revolutionary) would postulate quite another.  Of course, at the time this or any similar such decision had large numbers of very eloquent critics and proponents; so their arguments are easily discovered, if not obvious already.<p>(Or if you'd prefer to think in terms of Cabrini-Green, it's really not difficult to imagine what Elizabethan intellectuals would make of Cabrini-Green.)<p>Obviously, this historiographic practice accords with the basic scientific principle of judging an experiment by criteria established in advance.<p>It's a shame most people don't decide what historical ideologies are ""discredited"" by a rigorous and objective standard such as this.  Instead, the standard is the inevitable one: the winner is always right.  This is the simple, yet remarkably practical, basis on which our supposedly rational faith in the Enlightenment rests.",1337840325

Then it morphed into manipulation, but I think that has run it's course - even young children now know when they are being manipulated, and are resistant to it.<p>Because of this, my company concentrates entirely on providing remarkable services for remarkable prices, so our customers do our marketing for us by telling other potential customers. In our experience, this strategy works magnificently - we're doubling our revenue every year without spending a cent on marketing.<p>Back to Facebook - I see Google ads as informational marketing, and Facebook's as manipulative marketing. And currently Facebook is horribly bad at it - I think I've ""liked"" two products ever, because I think most of my ""friends"" would think I was really lame for endorsing anything that isn't truly exceptional.

Pitching for funding without a technical co-founder is impossible beyond a friends and family round, at least in the established startup hubs.  It's also very hard to find a good technical partner without already having demonstrated some traction: this makes sense as good technical partners have many options and want to see that you can deliver the non-technical side of the business (40% of a company worth 0 is still 0!).<p>So in this context spending a little savings on an MVP is a great way to go, it lets you show traction to get the funding or technical partner and can be done by raising from friends/family or working nights at another job.",1337839206

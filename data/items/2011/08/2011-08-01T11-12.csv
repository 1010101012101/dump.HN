An unarmed man being by definition a non-combatant.<p>The reason western militaries use uniforms is very different from the one you give. The fact that it differentiates conventional combatants from civilians is a consequence of wearing uniforms, not the reason. The original reason going back some centuries was to provide adequate, uniform, protection to poor peasants that lacked good clothing, distinguish own's troops from the enemy and instill ""esprit de corps"". The whole uniformed troops clearly marked as combatants is today a very Western value. We obviously would like everyone to fight like this, especially because Western armies are very good at this kind of fighting and would win quickly. Instead, they fight like guerillas, hiding among civilians, which multiplies their force and we can go on to complain how it's illegal according to Western customs.<p>And the whole ""protecting civilians"" argument doesn't hold water anyway, the ratio of civilian-military casualties keeps going up in the modern era.",1312199806

2831635,comment,2831292,2831594,3,0,_delirium,,,"It seems like a personal choice to me. If you want companies to use your code internally, and are okay with the fact that they might make improvements that they don't release back (or think that voluntary releases will be sufficient), then GPL or BSD/MIT is fine. If you don't want to allow for proprietary forks of stuff used in webapp backends, then AGPL is a better choice. If you have a different set of preferences about how people use your code than either of those, you can keep it proprietary and just negotiate custom licenses with potential users.<p>AGPL seems like a particularly reasonable choice if you're running a SaaS and want to release your code, but also want to make sure no competitor can use your code as a starting point from which to leapfrog you without releasing the improvements back for your own use. That's the approach gitorious takes, for example. Of course, the other way to keep competitors from leapfrogging you with your own code is not to release it at all, or release it with a proprietary license--- the approach github and Dropbox and many other SaaS take. From that perspective, AGPL is at least <i>more</i> liberal a license than the ""no code release"" license.",1312199241

I'd classify this approach as ""streaming"" rather than ""long polling"" though - in long polling, a browser opens a connection to the site which stays open until an event occurs, at which point it closes. As far as the browser is concerned, the request just took a few seconds to return - so the technique often bypasses dubious proxies and other issues (browsers have been really good at dealing with slow loading connections since the modem era).<p>Streaming is when the connection stays open and multiple messages are sent down the single pipe. It's faster and more responsive (and easier to scale since you don't have to deal with lots of connections being closed and reopened all the time) but is tricker to get working.<p>Of course, WebSockets make everything work sensibly hence avoiding the need for crazy hacks.<p>Here's a deck from a talk I gave on Comet back in 2008 which touches on some of this stuff <a href=""http://lanyrd.com/2008/skillswap-goes-javascript/skq/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lanyrd.com/2008/skillswap-goes-javascript/skq/</a>",1312197515

Why would anyone care about how you developed a single bugfix or a feature?<p>In your model, often the commits are not even sequential in the log because you might find a mistake only after committing several other changes. I can't see how not rebasing makes commit history better <i>in any way at all</i>. I would like to hear your reasoning.<p>The way I see it, instead of a series of commits that implement something, you could have a single patch (commit) that implements something, making it much easier to<p>0) find <i>all</i> the code that implements a certain feature, because it's a self-contained commit,<p>1) find bugs via bisection,<p>2) port to other versions via cherry-picking and<p>3) read the changelog and figure out what the hell is actually happening because there are no trash commits around obscuring things.<p>EDIT:<p>Just to clarify, I do not think that this is a matter of opinion or preference. That would imply that both approaches are equally valid.<p>I consider rebasing a tool that enables a vastly superior workflow. I have given a few reasons why I think it is superior and I am interested in counterarguments or at least reasoning as to why not making perfect commits (to the best of your ability) is preferable or even acceptable at all.",1312196926

Robin Hansson has a post about what he calls ""IP+"" (<a href=""http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/ip-like-barbed-wire.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/ip-like-barbed-wire.ht...</a>). I don't like the future he paints but it is better than today's setup.<p>A large (and growing) part of the world's population will want some kind of guarantee that they'll be compensated for their time and they'll be pushing for some kind of IP. Whether or not this will be better or worse for society, only data can tell us. But regardless of that, people want to optimize for what they think is best for themselves and their offspring and will vote on the basis of that.",1312196855

The government certainly ain't gonna be throwing people in jail for failing to back up some data, and it sure would be scary if they started. Instead...fines! ? Goverment and big, well-connected businesses have done a wonderful job of convincing people that regulations are what prevent companies from screwing people over, when they are merely a way for major corporations to keep out competition by making it harder small businesses to compete.",1312196733

And to think some of the best coders do not live in the US - think of Skype (Estonia), Tim-Berners Lee, Linus Torvalds, etc... Their contributions tower above anything done by any one person on Wall Street. Yet Wall Street has only contributed to the common good by paying taxes. Even then they seek to game the system and have also managed to get the government to give them more than they ever paid (think bailout). Their scrooge-like aversion to philanthropy, charity, education, or any research to help the human condition is what annoys. Certainly  those of you who code for the street have food in your belly, but when will you decide to fix your monstrous employer? They don't even have to know.",1312196605

I was fascinated with it when I first heard about it many years ago, especially to learn that the UK govt seemed to have allowed it to exist without shutting them down.<p>For others reading this who don't know the story my recollection of events is that it goes something like this:<p>(1) UK builds large offshore firing platforms in the english channel to target german bombers in WW2 then abandons them after the war.<p>(2) A military family moves to one of the platforms after the war and declares it to be an independant state. The UK government lets them get away with it.<p>(3) Over the years they remain there and allow others to come and live on the platform. They issue passports etc. At one point they were the base for a pirate radio station. At another point they fended off an armed invasion/attempted coup of the platform.<p>(4) In the late 90's havenco set up a business on the island. The idea was to provide secure hosting outside the scope of any legal harassment from authorities. The business didn't work out.<p>(5) A few years ago the platform burned down in a fire.<p>I'd love to hear accounts from people who have actually been there & seen it for themselves.",1312196496

That is the propaganda bullshit we get fed on every election cycle ""we got help America's small business. We gotta help Joe The Plumber...blah...blah.""<p>In fact America businesses are mostly large behemoths employing tens of thousands of minions.<p>There was just a recent report from the Center for Economic and Policy Research ( <a href=""http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/int-comp-small-business/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/int-comp-...</a> ) that compared employment in small businesses among the developed nations. US is consistently at the bottom when it comes to self-employment or employment in business with less then 20 people.  The biggest reason -- the high cost of health insurance.<p>So I don't buy the bullshit about ""if immigrants could only start their companies, then our economy would boom..."" Unless, of course, the author is implying that immigrants are going to run sweatshops where employees don't get health insurance...",1251651888

However when I go to wikipedia there is an article about anything I want to look up.  It seems like the low-hanging fruit is gone, so shouldn't we expect that it would slow down?  Once there is a critical mass of editors it makes sense to slow it down and keep the bar high for contributions.  It's far from perfect, but isn't it better than ""grow grow grow""?",1251651839

Wouldn't corporations just bring in more O-1 visas, for which there is an unlimited supply available?<p>The reality is that O-1 visas cost more than H1B visas to employ.

In all that I have studied on machine learning in both academia and start-up land, I have observed that you consistently pick algorithms to glean out the information you need from a particular dataset.<p>In many cases you can do what my graduate advisor recommends ""keep it simple stupid"" meaning that perhaps all that is needed is a k-nn approach and euclidean distance.  But sometimes the data is highly overlapped and complex, so you have to go with a more rigorous means of classification or whatnot.<p>Finally it should be noted that machine learning techniques are relatively new.  Neural networks have been around for quite some time and have well documented advantages.  ML by contrast is still a lot of black magic (tweaking of various magic parameters and such) so the benefits of various algorithms are somewhat subjective.",1251651769

3751927,comment,3750684,3751859,6,0,rcthompson,,,"It's a fallacy to think of a human brain as a distinct entity. If you are viewing the human brain as ""just"" a bunch of matter interacting in interesting ways to produce what we call consciousness (as opposed to viewing consciousness as something separate from the physical processes of the brain), then there is nothing really distinguishing your brain from the rest of you, and indeed from the rest of the universe. (Practically speaking, a good bit of decision-making happens in neurons outside of your brain.) So if you want to argue that the mind is equivalent to (or can be simulated by) a Turing machine, then you really want to argue that the whole universe could be simulated on a Turing machine.<p>Which is not necessarily a bad position to take. <a href=""http://xkcd.com/505/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xkcd.com/505/</a>",1332658781

3751925,comment,3751767,3751767,8,0,ilaksh,,,"Its not as simple as that.  From everything I hear, the teachers and school administrators are being squeezed between a rock and a hard place.<p>I would guess that there is a subculture of school administrators who feel that No Child Left Behind etc. are hurting curriculum and unfair to teachers and schools.<p>They have to decide between being honest about their scores or firing a bunch of teachers and/or possibly having their schools shut down, and/or having class sizes they can't cope with due to the need to hold back huge numbers of students.<p>I'm not a teacher but I have heard a few teachers talk about this.  I think its sort like what happens quite often between a manager and his employees: the manager makes some proclamations that are impractical and often unrealistic, and some significant portion of the employees decide they just have to smile and nod, but basically they are ignoring it as invalid.  So in this case they feel they are forced to falsify the results.<p>I think that probably there are some schools in well-off neighborhoods where kids are advantaged and the administrators don't run into these issues that they consider moral dilemmas.  The administrators and teachers in those schools may say that the other teachers deserved to be fired based on the poor performance of their students, but those privileged teachers aren't aware of the disadvantages that the other students are working against and therefore don't realize that students' failure to meet objectives often isn't their teacher's fault.<p>Personally I think that national measurements and guidelines are very important, but fine-grained command centralized control over an entire system has been proven time and again to be repressive and result in failure.<p>This goes for all sorts of systems, not just education.  It is good to try to come up with standards, do holistic analysis, have common data formats and an egalitarian shared perspective and goals.  But a system needs to be highly localized and non-homogeneous to be efficient, robust, and have the freedom to evolve and adapt to local conditions.",1332658736

3751911,comment,3750540,3751166,3,0,thwarted,,,"Automated systems are supposed to send to Sender, except when they're not... well, it depends on what you mean by ""automated"".  In the ""classical"" sense, the only automated system was the software that implemented SMTP itself, such as sendmail.  It generated bounces, it generated vacation replies, it was both the point of mail ingress and egress for mail's state in the system.<p>Now, there are automated systems that exist outside of SMTP.  For example, mail user agents generate vacation replies.  Things like gmail and Exchange/Outlook blur the line between mail server and mail user agent.  SMTP generated bounces are rarely useful for humans, but things like vacation messages are intended for humans.  If there is a reply-to, that's assumed to be more of a human (a human who will at least read the response, bounce or otherwise) than the chances that the Sender (on a message with a Reply-to) is going to be a human.<p>So, if you're talking about bounces, I'd expect them to go to Sender.  For vacation messages, I expect them to go to Reply-to.  And of course, YMMV, even MMMV, based on the email topology of any specific organization.  What counts as a bounce?  What counts as a auto-reply about the availability-state of the recipient?  Or the availability-state of the person/role collecting the recipient's email?  Is that significantly different from a bounce?  Can an automated system determine that?  Should it?<p>(sidenote: Personally, I hate vacation messages.  People think it provides an explanation for not immediately replying (anyone who thinks email is reliably immediate is an idiot), but all it does is show you care more how you don't respond when you're not around than when you are.)",1332658047

I would like to agree with your idea of tracking as payment, but I really can't, because:<p>a) Most of the time I don't have a choice. There's no option to pay them money and even if I pay them directly, they may still keep collecting tons of personal information about me on top of it.<p>b) It's sneaky. I don't really know what information they have and how they use it. I just have a couple of completely meaningless words from their privacy policy.<p>c) I don't know the price I'm paying.<p>The last point is the most important one. The value and the risk associated with a particular piece of information greatly depends on what other information it is combined with, but I can't control that. The company could get acquired tomorrow by some ad behemoth that knows a lot of other things about me, so the price I'm paying could change after the fact. That's not the way payment works.

Recommendation: Introduction to Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang
Reason: Strang presents the subject so clearly and intuitively that you feel like an expert on the subject after reading each chapter.  It is by the far the best textbook I have encountered.  
He is also an excellent teacher and offers the lecture notes to the corresponding MIT class online.<p>Book: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Fourth-Edition/dp/0980232716/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1332655225&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Linear-Algebra-Fourth-Edi...</a><p>Lecture: <a href=""http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-...</a>",1332655502

So there&#x27;s no economic incentive to try and shove half your possessions into a small overhead compartment.<p>Then it gets sillier when they gate-check the luggage anyhow. To deal with the problems caused by not checking luggage &quot;for free&quot;, they are ... checking a random selection of luggage at the gate. In a less efficient manner. In a way that slows boarding.<p>The most amazing part is that this situation has now totally inverted the order of boarding. It used to be that boarding last or near-last was a privilege.

Also, it&#x27;s important that you don&#x27;t need to introduce many concepts to do simple things, which is typically the case with C# or Java.<p>For instance, consider Hello World in C#:<p>public class Hello {\n   public static void Main() {\n      System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);\n   }\n}<p>you have either to explain several difficult concepts or tell the students that there are some magical things going there that they&#x27;ll understand later.

6817444,comment,6816779,6816779,1,0,dizzystar,,,"I started with Python, then Lisp, then I had my first job working with C#. I honestly don&#x27;t think C# would make one iota of sense to me if I did not have any background in programming.<p>I think that there is something be said about learning the value of all the libraries and working at a high-level view when your aim is production, but for learning, peeling away all the abstractions and forcing yourself to learn the fundamentals first is more important, with a much larger payoff once you are exposed to working with higher-level concepts. The dichotomy is that being productive is somewhat at odds with learning the fundamentals, but being productive in C# requires some intuition and knowledge about <i>when</i> to use a tool as much, if not more so, than <i>how</i> to use a tool.<p>I think that the entire .Net ecosystem is a terrible place to start. The first reason is Visual Studio. There is immense value in learning how to compile a program, using real REPL, learning how to design your file tree, and many other issues. I also think that a language that basically requires you to use code-completion is bad for your discipline as a programmer and doesn&#x27;t enforce one of the major tenets of LCTHW, which is that typing and accuracy are highly valuable skills and depending on code-completion is akin to doing copy-pasting. Typing forces you to consider the &quot;why&quot; of your actions.<p>I also think that C# is generally much slower to develop on because far more verbose than other languages. It is better, IMO, to just focus on the problem at hand. Having a program that is 3x longer than Python can&#x27;t be good for a beginner. Too much to focus on. Just get to the point and focus on it.<p>There aren&#x27;t many learning resources about C# and using it for programming fundamentals. The advice can often be highly confusing and at odds with what you are ultimately attempting to accomplish. There is something to be said abound step-by-step and simple and straight-forward when you are just starting out.<p>I think C# is fine as a second or third language to learn. The reason is that there are many wonderful ideas and concepts in there, but they won&#x27;t make a whole lotta sense without something to refer to in your own mind.<p>I hope the above isn&#x27;t interpreted as a bash of the language or .Net as I believe that C# is a beautiful language with some amazing concepts. With that said, I&#x27;m sick and tired of seeing slow sites with the .aspx extension.

A lot of people don&#x27;t really subscribe to any coherent system of the world at all.<p>When you press someone, it&#x27;s not uncommon for them to just pile on another fact about the subject matter and reassert the claim.<p>It&#x27;s like brute force puzzle solving, kind of like I used to do in adventure games - you know the result you want, juggle all the stuff in your inventory or mind until it works.<p>And for a lot of subjects, for a lot of education, that approach works really well.

(I&#x27;ve got a 5.56 semi-auto as well, but it&#x27;s mostly for the purpose of being able to use cheaper and more readily available ammunition for recreational shooting and not bruising my shoulder after a range trip, while using a calibre that&#x27;s still more fun/practical than .22lr)<p>As for taking money without your permission -- no matter how you look at it, it&#x27;s going to happen (whether via income taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, taxes on investment income, etc...). Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and company aren&#x27;t exactly socialists: when they advocate these programs, their goals are to increase individual liberty and decrease state intervention <i>in our lifetimes</i> (rather than pine for a utopian anarcho-capitalist future). I&#x27;d rather that money go directly to the poor than to bureaucratic middlemen and rent-seeking corporations (most of the existing welfare programs) or middle classes who don&#x27;t believe they (or perhaps their neighbours) are sufficiently competent to make their own retirement investments or choose the right health insurance plan for themselves (ACA, medicare, SS, etc...). I find the various paternalistic mandates (SS, ACA) to be more onerous than payments for the truly poor (some of whom as result of structural unemployment).<p>Replacing programs like SNAP and medicaid with a cash handout aren&#x27;t going to increase existing tax rates, which seem to be the equilibrium as far as taxation goes -- higher taxes on the upper brackets (or on investment income) won&#x27;t be accepted by the elites with political power, while increasing taxes in the lower brackets won&#x27;t gather sufficient votes. They might actually <i>decrease</i> the tax rates by reducing bureaucracy.",1385688652

As you get more experience in software or engineering, you will find yourself acing hard technical questions on interviews and knowing you have done well, yet, for some reason, the company won&#x27;t hire you.  In some cases, it will be because they, in fact, feel threatened, that you are better than they are.  You can be a direct threat if the hiring manager is running a project that is in trouble and higher ups or investors are unhappy about his/her progress.<p>From what I understand, Ooyala was founded by a couple of very young Google alumni; Google was their first job after Stanford.  The heavy technical interviewing is a typical Google practice, and Googler startups frequently copy Google practices.  Googler startups, especially those founded by ex-Googlers who have never worked anywhere other than Google, tend to be odd.  There can be a teenage rock star whose success and adoring groupies have gone to his head problem.<p>Some aspects of video technologies, such as developing and implementing video codecs, are extremely difficult.  It is fairly common for people to grossly underestimate the difficulties if they are unfamiliar with the field and then become frustrated and emotional in dealing with the problems.

This is the intended effect: The poor benefit the most and the upper-class are largely unaffected.  So it&#x27;s a good idea, right?  Not exactly: What are the poor going to spend their income on?  Primarily food, housing -- the &quot;not going hungry or cold&quot; things.  So they&#x27;ve got more money to go out and buy food and they will.  And the lower-middle-class who make a bit more than that will now have enough money to buy more food and better housing and they will.  And the middle-middle class have a little extra money to spend as they wish and they will.  And so on.  But the majority of that money will be spent.  With more free cash to go around, prices will rise to capture the additional profits.  When prices go up we have inflation and now the poor are back to not being able to afford food and shelter and the lower-middle-class are back to living hand-to-mouth and so forth.  The market compensates for the additional influx of cash by providing opportunities to soak it up, so it doesn&#x27;t wind up helping anyone in the long run.<p>Well we&#x27;ll just peg it to the rate of inflation and the problem will be solved, right?  Again -- it&#x27;s not that simple.<p>See, only one in three Americans is working.  If we determine that each American needs about $500 per month to &quot;not go hungry or cold&quot; then that means the average American will have to pay $1,500 in additional taxes.  We&#x27;ll burden the upper class with the majority of those taxes, of course, but this isn&#x27;t good for the middle class either.  The upper-middle-class winds up being saddled with enough additional tax burden that they join the middle-middle class.  And the middle-middle class who were previously getting along fine on a household income of $50,000 just joined the lower-middle class because even with the added income they have to pay more for the basics: food and shelter because of the additional inflation.<p>So now we&#x27;re saddled with a shrinking middle class, (sound familiar?) nobody being able to afford any more than they were before and the rich continue to remain largely unaffected by all of this.  In the end it accomplishes the exact opposite of what you set out to do.",1385688233

You&#x27;re expected to keep yourself up to date. You&#x27;re expected to read-up on new techniques, and all the goings-on outside of your day job programming language.

6817350,comment,6814500,6816519,1,0,rwallace,,,"Yes. The core of AIXI is the part that figures out the nature of the universe in which it finds itself (a formalization of induction), and the algorithm for that is essentially &quot;simulate all possible universes and see which ones give data that matches our observations, then apply Occam&#x27;s razor and assume the simplest one is true&quot;.<p>It will not have escaped your notice that &quot;simulate all possible universes&quot; would require an infinitely powerful computer, and even finite approximations quickly become wildly intractable, making the algorithm unusable for anything significantly more complex than Pac-Man. Thus AIXI is interesting for philosophical purposes, being a mathematical formalization of intelligence, but not useful for engineering purposes.",1385686901

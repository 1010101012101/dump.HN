3797113,comment,3796795,3796795,1,0,molbioguy,,,"There are definitely things that skew the index that might not necessarily reflect the quality of the journal.  For example, the 20th ranked journal by H-5 index is Nucleic Acids Research (NAR).  However, when you look at the H-index articles for NAR, you see that they are dominated by articles announcing or simply cataloging an important database.  These get cited very extensively, becuase anytime you use a database you need to cite it, but they aren't what I would call high impact research articles.  NAR just happens to be a journal that has a special annual Database issue where bioinformaticists can drop an article describing their  useful database.<p>EDIT: It would be fair to say that since a database is so widely cited it is important.  So maybe the index is more robust than I originally considered. But something still seems skewed here.",1333540597

3797102,comment,3795513,3795513,2,0,Scotchy,,,"I very often hear this comment from my fellow developper colleagues.<p>In our startup, I am responsible for the frontend coding. Very frequently, I get requests from other developpers to implement this or this, and very often those requests are annotated by a ""c'mon, it is just CSS, it'll only take you 5 minutes"" when they have absolutely no idea what they are talking about, because they never ever did real frontend developpment. They simply think that everything boils down to HTML and that frontend is NOT really programming. Attempting to explain that a frontend also has logic similar to backend, and that no, plotting graphs when you don't even have the data modeled is not just a 2 liner with Google Visualisation.<p>I am always offended by people estimating time for work they never did. So I find myself very rarely giving estimations. Sometimes when I have a very precise idea on how to implement an idea right when I'm being told about it, I usually say ""yeah this is definitely doable in a short time span"". Meaning things that do not take more than half a day to implement, because you already compiled the code in your brain.<p>Now, when a colleague of mine estimates stuff for me, I tell them ""No I don't think this is going to take X minutes to implement. If you think it is implementable so fast, why don't you go ahead and do it."". When they take it to the word, and I see them still struggling after many hours on some problem that are trivial to me, I will go ahead and help them out.

3797100,comment,3797052,3797052,2,0,stephengillie,,,"Tablets and phones currently have very good passive touchscreens. The problem with using syluses (stylii?) is these touchscreens really weren't designed for them. Adding an active touchscreen would probably remediate these issues,  but maybe that would make phones too big, and reduce battery life.<p>Active styluses pick up and refocus radiation from the screen, powered in a similar way to RFID chips. Maybe instead of providing input through the touchscreen, the stylus could have a tiny digital camera on its tip, detecting which pixel the stylus is on, and sending that info to the phone through Bluetooth or another means?<p>Perhaps the algorithms that handle touchscreen input are not properly calibrated to styluses, and an app or driver could make them operate more accurately?<p>-------<p>The best stylus experience I've used has been a Wacom dual active/passive screen on an HP tablet/laptop convertible. I had a nearly identical laptop with a passive-only touchscreen, adding the active touchscreen made all of the difference. On Windows 7 in Word, taking notes in economics and college math courses worked pretty well - I could type and take notes, then draw equations and graphs directly with the ink and review tools in Word. The use case was so valuable to me that I'm surprised nobody else did this, and other Office suites don't seem to offer anything even remotely similar.",1333540122

From an initial perusal, I found these features note-worthy:<p>* Explicit access to PC as a register, makes ""computed goto"" trivial and very natural.<p>* Because of the above, there is no JMP instruction.<p>* Treating operations on registers as ""values"" makes the instruction set very orthogonal.<p>* No instructions for bit-manipulation.<p>* Lots of possible NOP instructions, like ""SET PC,PC"" (which I <i>think</i> should work, depends a bit on exactly when it's incremented but it looks safe).<p>* Word-addressed memory will make string processing interesting to implement. Maybe in space, everyone uses UTF-16.<p>* Single 64 K address space will put quite the limit on the amount of code, I guess the game will show how much code is needed to do anything.<p>* No I/O instructions means I/O must be memory-mapped, further reducing the space available for code. Maybe there will be bank-switching?<p>* No interrupts.",1333540114

Ship or sink.<p>However, even though Dave Winer has historically been a great power both in writing and software development, I wonder whether the WMSS mantra as written really helped once applied in the context of what was effectively Agile philosophy in mid 1990s at UserLand.<p>AutoWeb and Clay Basket that came out in 1995 were in public beta, but never released. Then in 1996 Clay Basket was abandoned. It was four years later in 1999 that Manilla came out, which was the first product I remember the name of from that period.<p>UserLand may have been pushing the ""run it in beta"" thing long before Google and others made it so popular in 2004. But it's important to note, like anything else, you want to make something that isn't shitty to the user; if the process is shitty and it has bugs, fine, as long as the user uses it and keeps using it and the snowball of usage starts. It's great that WMSS worked at Living Videotext, though. Selling the company to Symantec and making a bundle wasn't too shabby either.",1333539836

I took another young guy on today, to mentor him through a project that we need done but not so badly it was worth us prioritizing it in our schedule. We're not paying him, but he's getting our time for free, and a good resume piece and reference from us if he steps up to the challenge that I think he can meet. Maybe more of us need to be doing this in our own businesses, bring back apprenticeships. If this guy does well, we'll either hire him if we can, or recommend him. I'll have a friend for life I can call on for advice in whatever speciality he chooses to go on with from here (he looks set to be a sysadmin whiz if he keeps at it). If he fails, I wasted nothing.

It's much better to buffer up such errors (Errorception does it in memory, since localStorage can be unavailable and/or full), and post them every once in a while.<p>As masklinn pointed out, window.onerror _is_ complete shit, so Errorception does a couple of tricks to make this slightly better. Firstly, on IE, the stack isn't lost when window.onerror is called, so it's possible to get the call stack and arguments at each level of the stack. Secondly, it's very easy to get other kind of details (browser, version, page, etc.), which helps a great deal in aiding debugging.<p>However, masklinn's suggestion about wrapping code in try/catch blocks is probably not a good idea. This is because some interpreters (I know v8 does this) don't compile the code in such code-paths. May cause a performance hit.<p>As DavidPP mentioned, depending on the nature of your application, it might be a good idea to not record too much sensitive information. For example, Errorception doesn't record function arguments if the page is served over SSL.<p>troels is right - this does create a massive flood of errors. There are several ways to deal with this. What we do for example, is hide away errors from most third-parties - Facebook, Twitter, GoogleBot, GoogleAnalytics, etc. The rest of the errors can still be huge in number, so we group similar errors together based on several parameters like browsers, browser versions, possible variation in inline code line-numbers because of dynamic content, etc.<p>Also, as Kartificial pointed out, this is probably something you don't want to do on your own server. You want to move this out of your infrastructure, and distribute it if possible.<p>There are other concerns - some that come to mind are page load time, ensuring that your error catching code itself doesn't raise errors (or if it does, it doesn't affect your app in any way), and that of managing data-growth on the server. These are fun problems, but it's probably not worth re-inventing the wheel.<p></plug>",1333538720

I'd be interested in some kind of median-citedness measure as well, to distinguish a venue that publishes 100 high-impact articles a year, from a venue that publishes 10,000 articles a year, of which 100 are high-impact.<p>In particular, it's not robust to one factor often mentioned in the bibliometrics literature, trivial changes in agglomeration size. Say a set of 200 articles are published by either: 1) a single journal; or 2) two journals, which publish 100 of them each. In each of the hypotheticals, individual articles have the same citation counts. Under this metric, #1 gets a higher ranking, meaning that you can raise rankings without increasing paper quality by just agglomerating journals. (You can even run the two former journals separately inside the new journal if you want, with a two-track review structure, as long as there's only one title on the front page.)",1333538642

The 6502 core's status register is resident and the flags in it are changed only when an op-code directly does so; it never ""resets"" arbitrarily, so proper conditionals that act on a specific status flag can actually occur far and wide between the op-code that actually affected that one specific flag.",1333537329

And you could expect those errors to be rare enough that the ""buffer"" would fill slowly and the odd error push wouldn't be a big strain.<p>[0] hooking into ajaxError is pretty dangerous really, if the user's connection goes down for instance the user machine is instantly going to loop at high speed.",1333537260

This probably accounts for the high level of arXiv, and PLoS One beating out PLoS Biol.<p>One problem with impact factors is the way that a few articles can account for the majority of citations. For instance, a bioinformatics method that is widely used could attract thousands of citations, boosting the impact factor of the journal by a few points. This method doesn't solve this, as it expressly focuses on the top n articles and ignores the impact of the remainder. For instance, PLoS One's score of 100 is because the top 100 articles got 100 citations - it says nothing about the distribution of the rest.",1333537219

New speakers often battle with the <i>responsibility</i> of speaking and being the target of multiple people's attention for a solid block of time. These battles can be fought virtually. (I'm a conference chair and have seen these battles fought and won.)<p>There'll still be work to do once one gets up on a stage or speaks ""for real"" but if one can get over 90% of the fear and do a lot of the work virtually, it could be a big win, especially for people who are initially too hesitant to attend something like a Toastmasters group. Virtual pep talks can work to a point, much like self help tapes.",1354402771

There are a lot of people who genuinely believe that sharing is not theft, and far from being something that we should persecute, is something that makes humanity richer and the world a better place, and many of those people do not believe it simply in order to feel better about copying stuff, since they don't actually 'pirate' copyrighted things.",1354402709

The people who pirate it are jobless students, while the target audience for Photoshop is undeniably professionals (who buy it).  This is evidenced by the lengths that Adobe <i>doesn't bother</i> to go to to prevent piracy.<p>Similarly, with video games people either pirate them because they are not in the market for things that cost $50, <i>or</i> because someone royally fucked up the legitimate distribution (with draconian DRM, or by not offering it on Steam, or whatever).

Certainly it's not in the content company's best interest for one person to purchase a CD and then make a copy for his neighbor. But what makes it stealing? The legality of shrink-wrap licensing can be debated, but in many people's minds the action is not disimilar to loaning the CD, or making photocopies of books at a library. Of course the moral behavior would be to respect the publisher's wish to receive payment from each possessor of a CD with those same arrangements of bits, although that course of action might be morally overridden due to certain extenuating circumstances (such as those encountered by the author).",1354401788

For many, this is the height of idiocy. Why would we allow individuals to have such power?<p>But technology is doing the same thing that guns do -- it's giving every person unprecedented power over his fellow man. DDOS attacks can bring down banks. Bio-research could unleash a deadly plague. As technology increases, the powers that one person has continue to grow.<p>So the issue of gun ownership is the same issue as freedom in technology. How much power should one person have? Every time somebody commits a crime on the internet, we're going to hear the same cries: why should individuals have so much power over others?<p>I don't have a facile or slogan-worthy answer.

According to the same poll, only 26 percent of Americans support a ban on handguns.""<p>This amazes me. I wonder how many of those 47% have had training? Or how many regularly practice firing the gun? This is one of the main reasons I'm opposed to people being allowed to own guns. Most probably don't know how to use them and in a situation where the weapon could be useful an untrained person will probably make the situation worse either by shooting another civilian or losing their cool and firing the gun and making a situation worse (e.g. in a robbery where everyone could come out safe if the thief gets the money - but some idiot with their own gun decides they will 'save the day', the thief freaks out and suddenly their are dead people).<p>Another reason I think guns should be make illegal in the US is the incredibly obvious evidence throughout the world that easier access to guns leads to more gun related crime. Coming from a country where guns are illegal it's very rare to hear or anyone being shot dead. Violent criminals obviously turn to other weapons such as knives but I would rather be up against a man with a knife than a man with a gun.",1354401631

Radioactivity of uranium is hardly a problem, when dealing with spent fuel. In short term (less than 100 years) fission products produce most of the radioactivity. In long term trans-uranium elements are the problem.<p>>Lets look at it's meltdown profile, CANDU reactors need heavy water to function, if you replace the heavy water with light water fission stops, no meltdown. Also before the reactor would ever get to that point the fuel bundles deform, halting meltdown.<p>Halting a normal fission chain reaction is hardly a source of accidents in any current nuclear reactor design. Decay heat is produced in the spent nuclear fuel of CANDUs just like in Fukushima or Three Mile Island.<p>CANDU is an interesting reactor design, but there is none as great alternative as you propose.

But most people I hear justifying piracy feel entitled to it and don't think there's anything wrong.<p>And what is dishonest about that?<p>When a builder builds a house he gets paid for his work.  If he wants more money, he has to do more building.  He can't just sit back and take a payment every time someone enters that building for the rest of his life.<p>Nurses, doctors, lawyers, shopkeepers, mechanics, service staff, chefs, teachers all have the same deal.  You can't multiply your work by the people who benefit from it forever (maybe everyone who likes the person whose life you saved?) and get paid by each one.<p>Now to me, that seems sane and normal.  You want more money, you do more work. Getting the government to pass special laws allowing you to extract rent from your creative endevour for every person who experiences it going into the future is what seems dishonest to me.",1354399279

But it won't happen. A series of GoT costs $50 million to make and they could probably fairly easily crowdfund it, (e.g. $10 * 5 million or some other multiple). I'm sure lots of people would be prepared to pay that amount (or a lot more) to ensure they could watch the next series -- I know I would.",1354399223

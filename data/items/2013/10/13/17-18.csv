6543460,comment,6540735,6540735,1,0,notduncansmith,,,"As they say on ShopTalkShow, &quot;JUST BUILD WEBSITES!&quot;.  It took me about 3 months to get to &quot;practical web developer&quot; status with almost no coding background (was previously in marketing).  Another 3 months of practice and I was competent enough to get a job doing it.<p>How did I do it?  Total immersion.  I spent a few hours every day doing tutorials, and then applying those lessons in little throw-away projects.  When not coding or learning, I listened to podcasts in the space.<p><a href=""http://shoptalkshow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shoptalkshow.com</a> by Chris Coyier and Dave Rupert is FANTASTIC, they do a friendly Q&A podcast with guests, sound effects, and it&#x27;s just a lot of fun overall.<p><a href=""http://codeschool.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeschool.com</a> by the guys at Envy Labs is the best place to learn, bar none.  I tried plenty of sources: Udemy, CodeAcademy, Treehouse, and various other platforms.  These were all &quot;okay&quot; to &quot;pretty good&quot;, but CodeSchool is the best value for your money.  The courses alone are worth the $25/mo, but you also get exclusive screencasts that are really great for enhancing your learning.<p>Stack Overflow is your best friend.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing direct searches on their site when you first run into an issue (just Google your problem) but the vast majority of solutions will come from SO.  You can trust the answers on there for the most part, and the best part is that most answers are very informative: they explain the reason for the problem and why the solution works, instead of just giving you some code to copy & paste.<p>If you&#x27;re a strong independent learner, you should have no problem following along with the CodeSchool courses (they move pretty fast though, don&#x27;t feel bad about watching the videos multiple times).  Sign up for a month, take a few courses (one or two a week should do at first).  Then once you&#x27;re finished with a lesson, go build a little website (it can be stupid, many of mine were) to demonstrate what you just learned.<p>If you run into issues, Google it.  <i></i>This is how you will learn.<i></i>  Ultimately, no tutorials will take you from 0 to &quot;rockstar ninja guru&quot;, that will only come with experimenting.  A helpful template for Google searches is [technology] [command or problem].  For example, &quot;move a div with jQuery&quot; or &quot;rails generate migration&quot;.  Sometimes including the phrase &quot;how to&quot; works, like &quot;how to deploy node app&quot;.  Also, &quot;is broken&quot;, while less specific, can work: &quot;doctype broke my CSS&quot; will probably explain why changing your doctype is causing style anomalies.<p>Also, just to be clear: I&#x27;m not affiliated in any way with any of the websites I mentioned above and have no vested financial interest in them.  They&#x27;re just awesome :)",1381687175

6543443,comment,6543117,6543405,1,0,viraptor,,,"Sure. But sometimes the strict limit forces you to do things that are worse than just leaving the long line, simply to comply with some automated coding style enforcement. For example sometimes you have to break up strings into separate parts and wrap the last argument following them to it&#x27;s own line for readability... Even if the same arguments pattern if used all over the project (so one line would be more recognisable / readable). So you get 3 lines that are worse (for example) to grep than one line just because it would have 85 characters otherwise.<p>Long lines are unreadable, enforced short lines are unnatural, common idea of the best judgement doesn&#x27;t exist. :(<p>Newspapers can deal with this by squeezing words / letters together, or allowing more space in some lines to make the text align better.

The 1950s, 1960s and 1970s now appear anomalous in their move toward a more equitable distribution of wealth; such that people in the top, say, 10%, might have had a chance at a share in meaningful power and wealth. The creativity and happiness books, TED talks, and their ilk are trying to make the (middle-)managerial class not notice this for a while longer, or feel better about their place in the distribution that is shifting away from them. The professional middle class spends a lot of time right now differentiating themselves from the lower classes, when in fact if your non-home wealth is less than some number (apparently about $400k in 2004[1]), you have a lot more in common financially with them than with the billionaire giving the TED talk.

A very simple example is getting a distributed count of &quot;yes votes&quot;. The naive solution is to have each server send a &quot;incrementVote()&quot; RPC calls. But what happens if an RPC is retried? Will your count accidentally be too high? A better solution is to send a &quot;vote(myUUID)&quot; message, which adds the UUID to a set. The number of votes is now the cardinality of the set of UUIDs. Voting is idempotent and the count is monotonic. The goal of Bloom is to create a language in which the right properties are ensured by construction.",1381686343

This simply isn&#x27;t a fair comparison.  I am not a builder, so I&#x27;m sorry if this analogy falls flat, but it&#x27;s less like a universal hammer and more like the framing of a house.  While there might be different approaches of framing a house for the most part the goal of framing is to ensure the house is structurally stable and can then be built into what the owner wanted.  This is exactly what a framework attempts to do.  My second complaint is similar.<p>If I&#x27;m building a simple &quot;spice rack&quot; such as a contact form then a framework is certainly overkill.  However if one uses a framework to solve such a simple solution then the complaint should be targeted towards the developer.  Quite frankly given the hardware available, and the fact that I could develop something like this quickly with or without a framework, it almost makes this point moot.<p>Finally it&#x27;s the job of engineers/developers to understand that each problem has multiple solutions.  As such it is up to the engineer to choose the solution that best fits the problem and execute.  Frameworks will not always be a good solution, but at times they will be absolutely the best decision one can make.  Good engineers don&#x27;t think such black and white terms.",1381686327

6543353,comment,6540818,6541981,2,0,tothebatfax,,,"> This is silly - the poor are not unemployed, structurally or otherwise. To be unemployed one must be looking for work, which most American poor are not.<p>You&#x27;re not accounting for those that have given up looking for jobs.  Additionally, the report mentions that children are also included in the 46.2 million people below the poverty level.  Also, if you know anything about the workings of Temporary Assistance for Need Familiies (TANF), the main federal block grant for welfare as defined under the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), then you know that 1) welfare recipients must work for 24 months to continue receiving welfare, and 2) that there is a 5-year lifetime limit on being in welfare [1].  So, though your report mentions that most people below the federal poverty line, there&#x27;s plenty of evidence to assume 1) those who aren&#x27;t working are also not on welfare, with the possibility that 2) those who aren&#x27;t looking for work have simply given up, as is the case for many, many Americans post-2008 recession.<p>> Your source [2] also disagrees with you.<p>Clarification, if anything the source disagrees with itself since the entirety of my use of it was within quotation marks.  That said, I don&#x27;t think it does disagree with itself.  1) We have no idea what the welfare/person spending was, as you note, so it&#x27;s &quot;silly&quot; to assume that there were obvious net savings when we simply don&#x27;t have the data.  If you&#x27;re not willing to trust the source on that, then at least trust the numbers for Arizona and Utah.  Secondly, you say that &quot;the actual number in Florida&quot; was close to 2000, that 2000 people withdrew their applications when reaching the drug testing stage.  You&#x27;re obviously implying that they withdrew because they were on drugs and wary of not passing the test.  You fail to mention the financial aspect to the drug tests--the welfare applicants themselves had to pay for the drug test according to the source you link to [2]. It was highly plausible, as noted in the article, that the ones who didn&#x27;t take the test couldn&#x27;t net that amount of cash.<p>As to Florida&#x27;s program itself, it was deemed unconstitutional and stopped since it &quot;unconstitutionally mandated searches without suspicion.&quot;[2]  This was for the same reason you note that the Arizona program was &quot;less effective&quot;--namely because it didn&#x27;t assume that just because a person was poor, they were using drugs.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0258.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d0258.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story/2012%E2%80%9403%E2%80%9418/drug-testing-welfare-applicants/53620604/1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/story...</a>",1381685630

They&#x27;re simply prestigious <i>by default</i> because of lock-in.<p>There are now ways of running an online reputational community, e.g. StackExchange, but they rely on a willingness to do things a different way. The more conservative members of the academic community aren&#x27;t likely to shift their approaches, especially when they don&#x27;t already participate in forums or academic blogging. They don&#x27;t directly feel the pain of expensive subscriptions, either. So the academic publishers - the old order - can continue to rely on their deeply entrenched position as the arbiters of research quality - even though this quality is created by the <i>unpaid academics</i> who sit on the editorial committees.<p>(In fact, the publishers even sell this as a value that their journals provide - <i>reputation</i> - when it isn&#x27;t an intrinsic value, but one that accrued to them while there was no feasible alternative. That value has now lost its underlying basis, but it persists because of inertia, and they&#x27;re merely <i>extracting rent</i> from their ownership of the journals&#x27; brands, now.)<p>The solution, to my mind, has to be multifold:<p>1) Spread the dangerous idea that science should be accessible to all and free from paywalls, such that in all polite circles it should be a matter of course to believe so;<p>2) Build a very simple-to-use, cross-journal meta-database and community - preferably open-source - that collects papers from all open journals and aggregates upvotes, citations and prestige/rankings, and help it gain wide, career-influencing acceptance like Github enjoys now (maybe the arXiv could be evolved and adapted to fill this role?);<p>3) Get buy-in from senior decisionmakers and thought leaders in various academic fields by offering them a chance to shape the system.<p>This won&#x27;t happen without the joint efforts of leading academics (like Sir Timothy Gowers), skilled technologists, UX designers, and government funders. Most of us on HN know how we could build a technical solution that fills these needs - we might even volunteer our time toward it - but we need marketers and advocates who can sell this system to the people who matter (who currently don&#x27;t see the need to upset the current system). The reputational advantage enjoyed by commercial publishers won&#x27;t be overcome simply with engineering.<p>(If anyone knows of open-source projects to this end, or about the arXiv&#x27;s plans, please share them.)",1381684732

If the 1.1X idea were the first one to come to market to begin with, it may have been 10X over the existing ones and thus may have seen wide adoption that the reference 1X idea saw.  In other words, ideas that are 1.1X better see resistance to adoption due to what is entirely history (= past progress) even though they are ultimately still better by definition.",1381684237

You can get <i>private</i> help without anybody knowing anything about it and you can do so in a really efficient way, since there's absolutely nobody watching you.<p>Coursera courses are for people willing to learn something, providing certificates was stupid in the first place, poisoning the well for everybody that's there for the right reasons. The topics are not exactly PhD-level, you can probably find 80% of all the answers you need by doing stupid Google searches and even if we were talking about PhD dissertations, cheating is still possible, the only difference being the difficulty threshold.<p>That cheating is so easy on Coursera, ""<i>give me an A</i>"" is precisely what's going on for people that are there, not for the learning experience, but for an A.<p>Which is why the value in these courses is only for personal growth and personal gratification. I would never look at such certificates on a resume, because such certificates are even less valuable (from a market perspective) than a piece of toilet paper, because at least a piece of toilet paper is useful for something while at work. And no, interest in subjects such as ""Scala"" is not enough, because such proxies for performance can be easily discovered and hence gamed.<p>Also, the gratification comes from <i>knowing</i> that you worked and that you passed the tests. The certificate only holds personal value if this condition is met.<p>And in the context of Coursera, that certificate does not make sense anyway. If you follow the forums, you'll get a lot of people asking if they can still join the course with late submissions, providing reasons for why they are late in the hope that staff will make exceptions (they've taken long trips, the dog ate their homework, etc...) - which is just a mindbogglingly dumb thing to do.",1349801857

The major major number then becomes meaningless and you end up with absurdities like ""2.6.39"".<p>I think the solution they chose is much better than the one Linus chose.

Visit e.g. Ian Bicking's account: <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/ianb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bitbucket.org/ianb</a> . Is it easy to find out why are so many people following Ian? What repositories are interesting? ""bbdocs"" with 4 followers? From the first page of Ian's repositories I know ""dozer"", did Ian wrote it? Click. Oh, it's an outdated fork.<p>Just compare the direction Github took at its recent redesign. GitHub folks made user profiles act like resume. The repositories are visually big, it is clear what repositories are popular, what repos are active, etc. It is also clear what a person is into: repositories are sorted by 'last modified' date. There is ""Explore"" section with trending repos (bitbucket's Explore is a joke) and so on.<p>Bitbucket instead removed follower counts and fork counts from the repositories list; repositories are sorted alphabetically now; there is no way to see who the user follows or who user is followed by.<p>I was missing important ticket updates at bitbucket several times because the newsfeed is not ""infinite""; ""Inbox"" messages count stops working sometimes, etc.<p>There are things bitbucket is better at: e.g. github links to source code lines are awful (they don't contain changeset information in URL by default and so easily become outdated); there is no way to specify repo language in github (one of my recent Python repos was in a ""Top followed this week"" for a C language, that's great of course but..)<p>Don't get me wrong, bitbucket becomes nicer and nicer, I'm still a heavy bitbucket user and we use a paid account at work; but it seems that the open source support (code discovery and presentation) is not their priority right now, or at least they act so.",1349801744

4632607,comment,4632381,4632381,1,0,stephengillie,,,"This article is mostly newspaper fetishisim about the company's owners. What HN is interested in was contained in a single, unsurprising paragraph. I've cut it up to comment:<p><pre><code>  One reason that Indian newspapers thrive is the absence of digital competition. Less than ten per cent of the population has access to the Internet, and, with two-thirds of the population surviving on less than two dollars per day, expensive smartphones and tablets arent about to replace print media as the news-reading platform of choice.

</code></pre>
So the state of today's Indian newspaper industry is the same as USA's in about 2000.<p><pre><code>  Also, Indian papers are cheap, costing between five and ten cents daily. There are few newsstands in Indiaonly five per cent of papers are sold over the counterand home delivery is free, paid for by the publishers.

</code></pre>
As philanthropic as ""paid for by the publishers"" sounds, it means the delivery fee is paid for indirectly, instead of charging it explicitly on the bill. I think the article is trying to say that newspaper delivery is expected in India.<p><pre><code>  The actual price of each paper is even lower, because of what Indians call raddi, their recycling program. Subscribers save their newspapers, which are picked up by raddiwallahs each month; the customer receives about ten cents per pound, and the raddiwallahs sell the bundles back to the paper companies to be recycled.*

</code></pre>
The first result on DDG says a Sunday newspaper can weigh nearly one pound in large cities. Assuming the other 6 pages per day combined weigh another pound means recycling can pay for a couple of free newspapers per week.<p>This makes me wonder about CPK rates in India.",1349801633

These ideas, later written as code, would have resulted in better products.""<p>To expand a bit on what the author is saying, if programmers were taught how to communicate clearly in everyday language, they would instinctively take at least one review pass at what they've just written and edit it for clarity. And later, when they learned how to program, they would review their code in the same way -- with a desire to clarify code that might work but that's neither clear nor optimal. This is especially important when programmers work in teams.<p>I often correct people's writing here, a behavior that creates no small amount of annoyance. But when I correct people's code, for some reason the rules are different -- the second is accepted, but the first isn't.<p>I see code and natural language as the same, equally open to correction and improvement, but it seems most people look at poor writing skill as a sort of natural handicap, congenital, embarrassing and rude to bring up.

Its alarming because this type of response just goes to show that the people creating things for the web are so completely out of touch with real users. There's this weird idea among developers that users know how to use technology just like we do when in fact they don't even know which website handles their email half the time, think Google is the internet, use the browser search bar to type full URLs even though the actual address bar is 10 pixels to the left, and will blame you for giving them a virus because you changed their desktop wallpaper and not because of all those shady links to foreign lotteries they were clicking in their email which they were lucky to find in the first place.<p>Yeah, you can tell the difference. I could tell the difference. Yes it was very obvious even though the demo was very accurate in reproducing my browser's chrome. But the rest of the world is nothing like us. Feross says 10% will be tricked. I think that's a very conservative estimate. I wouldn't be surprised is the numbers went above 50%. If this sort of attack becomes common then I bet you anything that the majority of users will be tricked just because full screen is not very common. You'll say full screen is common but again, you're thinking of people just like you who are in the minority. Most people have never seen a website in full screen mode. Even with Facebook's full screen option it doesn't mean your parents are clicking that option or have even noticed it yet.<p>I'm actually building an app currently that greatly benefits from the full screen API and I really hope vendors don't start putting more restrictions on it. Instead I'm hoping there's a way to make full screen more common in legitimate ways, get users used to full screen mode so they are aware of it and know what the little ""Now in full screen mode"" dialog means. Sure, people will still get tricked but I'd bet it would be in far less numbers and that 10% figure Feross throws out there might become more realistic.",1349801444

Not only is the compiler continuously complaining, once you ship code, your customers call in to complain about every conceivable bug and a great deal that weren't conceivable.

I feel that our approach differs, though, in forcing the notification to be explicit, as opposed to tied to object lifecycle callbacks. It's plain to see in our controller what event is being announced, and trivial to find all listeners that respond to that event. No familiarity with the model being manipulated is required, because it's got nothing to do with either the event announcement or the responses to it. And by providing a centralised event dispatch system, there's a simple point of entry for debugging.<p>We did consider the service object approach, as detailed early in the blog - for me, though, it feels wrong to end up with a bunch of service objects, each with a semi-random grab-bag of dependencies and responsibilities. One of our main aims was to reduce the random scattering throughout our app of various calls, because the coupling was making it hard to reliably effect change when necessary. Service objects don't address this, unfortunately.

We've tried emphasizing the honor code and putting resources into teaching quality. This leads to endemic cheating. We've tried cracking down very hard on detection, and this leads to massive work for the instructors, lots of busted students and a general ""meh"" from the administration. Finding the right balance is really tough.<p>I don't get it - it never occurred to me to cheat as an undergrad.

There is nothing open about an unspecified research project without a proven multi-party governance structure that's dominated from start to finish by Google, and which only Google could afford to staff and push -- including via big-money distribution deals with game developers and distributors.<p>As I said at Strange Loop and in past talks, don't shoot the messenger: Microsoft and Apple will never adopt NaCl/Pepper. It is a non-starter as a web standard.<p>Why pray tell should Mozilla fall on Google's sword here? Why should we beg to be involved more ""in the process"" years after it started? Who are you to say that NaCl/Pepper is <i>better</i> for developers or anyone else than a cross-browser approach targeting JS VMs, which are already there and getting fast enough with typed array memory models to compete with PNaCl? (We aim to demonstrate this.)<p>NaCl/Pepper looks like an incumbent power's technological folly, similar to Microsoft Active X or Google's Dart-as-a-native-VM. Just because a big company can pay for it does not make it ""Open"" or ""Good"" or good for the web.<p>You've been free with charges of dishonesty, but I'll refrain from drawing conclusions about you from your position except to say that what you write is astoundingly naive -- at best. For anyone building a competitive browser that is not Chrome or chromium-based, what you propose is a money pit in direct and opportunity costs, with no clear path to standardization, where Firefox would always be behind in ""Pepper conformance"" compared to Chrome. The answer is no.<p>You'll get the same answer from any other browser vendor not free-riding off of chromium/Google.",1349799832

Unlike software or fashion or business, the products here are extremely expensive to develop and almost trivially easy to reproduce. In the case of pharmaceuticals, patent protection pays not only for the physical development of the drug, but also the trials of its efficacy and safety.

Patrick McKenzie runs a small, online business selling bingo cards to teachers (he sold over $45,000 worth of bingo cards in 2011). One thing Patrick does really well is search engine optimization (SEO). One of his techniques for getting people to link to his site (a big part of a high Google ranking), involves open source software. What!? That might be your reaction right now. What does open source software have to do with bingo cards for 1st graders?<p>The answer is nothing. However, Patrick is a software developer that wrote the code for his bingo card website. He recognized that some of the code he wrote was valuable all on its own. So he turned part of it into an open source Ruby on Rails project, put the code up on his site along with instructions on using it, and then told the world about it. What happened? All sorts of software developers, with no interest in bingo cards but a huge interest in his software, started linking to the portion of Patricks website that hosted this open source project. More links to his website meant a better ranking on Google which meant more sales of his bingo card creator. So while he didnt directly sell his offering the way Amazon sold theirs, he did use it in a way that created more business for him.</i>",1349799481

If you explore stores beyond 7/11, you'll see that there is plenty of ""normal food"" in the US.<p>Some people choose to eat artificially-produced cheese substitute, but despite the ads you see on TV, not everyone does.<p>The same goes for coffee and beer, mentioned in comments below.  I always buy coffee within a day or two of roasting, and even if I buy it at the grocery store, it's still within two weeks.  Sure, you <i>can</i> buy old coffee and save money, but you don't have to.  (As for pre-ground coffee, many people value the convenience of not having to buy a $200 coffee grinder and grind their own coffee over having the best coffee possible.  In America, you get to decide!)<p>Finally, we have a lot of good beer over here.

With quantitative easing, etc., the Fed has actually created negative real interest rates.<p>If anything I'd be worried that there are powerful interests lobbying for targeted booms.  The housing/building sector has been a huge beneficiary of transfers of wealth from taxpayers and users of currency as a store of value, and probably has its sights on another Fed-fueled building/housing boom.<p>Right now lots of Americans make payments on credit cards which are useless bc the limit has been reduced, etc.  There is also pressure on the Fed from banks who know that there could be waves of new defaults in consumer credit cards.<p>So on balance I think the fear is an over-reaction by the Fed rather than an under-reaction.  There is also an interesting meme coming into focus in which credit is viewed as a right just like healthcare.",1278812910

There's also a value transfer from the unlucky couple to the person who provides liquidity by buying the couple's business for cheap.<p>Using his example, the value of the couple pre-divorce was (roughly): (A) $1,000,000 in value for his share of his business, plus (B) $55,000 in cash. That's $1,055,000 in value, or $527,500 for each partner.<p>After the divorce, the value of the couple is: (A) $250,000 in value for his share of the business (because of a quick sale of an illiquid business), plus (B) $0 in cash ($55k in cash to lawyers). That's a total of $250k, or $125k for each partner.<p>The majority of the value transfer, then, goes to the buyer of the couple's illiquid business, which must be sold too-quickly.

491368,comment,491116,491116,0,0,jimrandomh,,,"Every functional language I have tried has given me a compelling reason not to use it. In most cases, it was a stupid reason that had nothing to do with it being functional. Some of them force you to sort your functions by call dependence (caller must be after callee). Most of them are woefully lacking in library and toolchain support - no bindings for essential APIs, no graphical debugger, no code completion. In the end, it proved easier to add functional features to languages which already had these things and had proved themselves free of fatal flaws, than to fix the flaws and add support to the functional languages people were promoting.",1235372247

For one thing, ""X works"" and ""Y can work, too"" are not two bits of advice which are in opposition to each other, and shouldn't be treated as such.  (Even when X = ""Startups should have multiple founders"" and Y = ""Actually, you can get by with one person if..."")<p>For another thing, evaluating expertise by weight of incomparable circumstances is not logical.  If it were, we'd all be taking advice from McDonalds on how to sell software, as the sum total of all customers of every startup company which has ever been mentioned on this site would not equal the number of cups of coffee McDonalds sold worldwide yesterday.  Now there are many things to learn from McDonalds, but willy-nilly application of their ideas because they have mass on their side is a bad idea.  (The sweet spot for pricing is below $5.  Advertising is less about motivating people to buy in the near future than building your brand image for life.  Literacy is a nice attribute to have in an employee but is not necessary if you exercise proper management.)",1235372193

Now, I'm not saying you can't abide by these rules without cofounders but having them around keeps the momentum going.  One of us is always full-speed ahead.",1235372062

Similarly, nobody cares about your language or the software, if it is a piece of crap.<p>Every time there is a post about D on Slashdot, Reddit, etc., there are people saying that D is such a wonderful language that they have migrated/are busy migrating all their projects to it.

That is, you see a complete cross section of American women, but only a select group of ambitious European women who emigrated as adults. They are here because they are serious about their careers, so they are more likely to believe in working hard to get ahead rather than getting by on their looks.",1235371539

A company with sound fundamentals that suffers bad market news is a buying opportunity. The opposite is harder to find, and the bulk of the profit from his approach comes from time, not timing, so he does not actively look for it.",1235371419

But it would be a step in the right direction for a manager to simply observe what Jobs did when he first returned to Apple.<p>In particular, Jobs axed all the different Mac models being developed, and made a single compelling product: the iMac.  This focused the business, and created a market.<p>It wouldn't take Jobs himself to do this with automakers.  In fact, it hasn't; just look at something like the redesigned VW Beetle, or the Mini Cooper, both the iMacs of their markets.",1235370829

491346,comment,491116,491116,0,0,miked,,,"""Pure"" FP languages eliminate state. All programs contain an (implicit or explicit) model of the domain they are computing on. Many aspects of the world (domains) that we need to model are stateful. Our programs, in modeling those domains, often must be stateful. This is why it's hard for programs to be entirely functional.<p>On the other hand, state dramatically complicates reasoning about code, since outputs are no longer purely a function of inputs. Moreover, even with lexical scoping, it's not immediately clear what the state variables are a function of. As the scope of state variables increases, it becomes ever harder to determine what a state variable <i>is</i> a function of. This is why programs should be as functional as possible.<p>Solution: a language like Clojure or Common Lisp, which naturally encourages a functional approach while allowing side effects when neeeded. Clojure has some advantages over CL in this regard, since it has several clever mechanisms such as agents and software transactional memory to control side effects.",1235369391

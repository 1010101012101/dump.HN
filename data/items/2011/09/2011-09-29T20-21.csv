I use it to store and read _3rd party ebooks_ only. This is also the reason I do not own an iPad or an iPhone: I will not give up that much control and information to any one company.

Basically, lack of designer input to OSS projects for whatever reason was problematic.<p>Perhaps it's because engineers don't solicit designer input.  Perhaps it's because by the time the engineer-only project arrives on a designer's desk, it's too ugly to consider. Perhaps it's because designers don't have the same OSS ethos.

""viajando"" could be translated to ""traveling"" or ""travel to"".<p>I was blown away by the new interface google provided for flight search. I mean, Hipmunk in itself proposed a new, unique, and novel way that (at least in my opinion) completely changed the landscape of how flight search should be done. But when google stepped in, it proposed an almost instant manner for me to see flights, repeat searches, put in adjustments and what-not. The simplicity of it was also something that got me itching...<p>My wife is always looking out for cheap tickets to visit back home, and I thought it would be great if she could use that interface... but alas, flights are still limited to US only. So when I saw a $2 .us domain go up on namecheap, I snatched viajando.us and coded this really simple way to see flights to/from US/Brazil with no typing whatsoever.<p>Obviously, there are limitations:<p>1) US/Brazil flights only
2) Limited number of airports
3) Round-trips only<p>All of these limitations are <i>for now</i>. Although (1) probably won't change so soon, (2) and (3) has more to do with the huge amount of background search and parsing I need to do to get all the updated search results. Each airport has all flights to the other country's hubs, all dates with a 15 day range, and all round-trip flights with a 30/15 trip length.<p>While the interface only shows the cheapest flights, I have them all. In fact, this will probably be really fun to play with from the statistical and data mining point of view... to see which airports, air line companies, and flights have the greatest variability, etc..<p>Would love any feedback from everyone here.

But it actually does make sense.<p>My understanding is that many (all?) of these studies have been conducted in sub-Saharan africa.  The environment in which AIDS spreads may be very different in developed countries.  The presence of secondary infections, unhygienic conditions, and other social norms may play a big role in the spread of aids and greatly amplify the protection that circumcision provides.  The evidence does look compelling.<p>Now, if the infection rate is already low, secondary STDs are rare, hygiene is at a very high standard, and transmission vectors are different, then the effects might be much less pronounced. I suspect it would be hard to create a controlled study of this in Europe, since you'd have to convince a large number of men who are probably in a very low risk group to be circumcised.",1317326675

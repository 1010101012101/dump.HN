10585401,comment,10576155,10584410,0,0,mikekchar,,,"I wish I had a reference for you, but I recall reading some UI guidelines that discussed how long you have before you need to give feedback to your users.  IIRC 2 seconds was the longest amount of time that didn&#x27;t feel like you were waiting forever.  Once you got past 6 seconds, basically people think it is broken.<p>I have the same experience as you do, and these numbers of 2 seconds and 6 seconds really seem about right.  If the test runs in less than 2 seconds, I can stay focussed on what I&#x27;m doing.  By 6 seconds, I&#x27;m already thinking about something else.  My personal experience has been that if the tests takes longer than 2 seconds, it is virtually impossible to do TDD.  Instead you have to write large chunks of code -- or at the very least write several tests in one go.<p>I&#x27;m fairly well known in my current group for the 2 second rule :-)  2 seconds is really a long time for a modern computer, so my feeling is that if you can&#x27;t build and run a large section of tests in 2 seconds, you&#x27;ve got a serious problem somewhere.  When pairing with people who don&#x27;t mind longer test runs, I&#x27;ve noticed that they never actually TDD.  Instead they right large pieces of code (entire functions at the very least), or they write 5-10 tests all in one go.  When I show people the normal rhythm of TDD, they suddenly understand why you need to have incredibly fast tests.<p>I also preach a 2 minute limit for the entire test suite.  Kent Beck has talked about that previously (although I can&#x27;t remember what number he used -- something like 2-4 minutes).  He has even advocated simply throwing away long tests.  Test coverage is less important than being able to run your tests quickly.  I have found that if the test suite creeps up to about 10 minutes, the frequency of running that test suite is reduced to about once per day -- meaning that you have totally lost the context of the problem when you discover it.<p>Whatever you need to do to keep those tests running quickly is what you should do.  Whether that means only running a subset, hot loading modules, stubbing out slow moving pieces (even the database), etc.   I could write for quite a long time on testing strategy... This needs to go on my queue for a blog post ;-)",1447811620

One does not assume that of PG, hence it&#x27;s a double standard. You&#x27;re assuming (despite having just read an essay by PG to the contrary) that he&#x27;s the one with the talent and she&#x27;s just along for the ride.<p>I tried to be explicit in saying the facts of this particular situation don&#x27;t really matter. It pattern-matches against a narrative structure that isn&#x27;t feminist, so it isn&#x27;t feminist.<p>Personally, I think it&#x27;s always inappropriate to mix one&#x27;s professional and personal lives, and my opinion is that in a situation like this, one of the partners should have dropped out of the company to ensure that there was no appearance of impropriety and to ensure that the remaining person was taken seriously. If Jessica was more valuable to YC than Paul, it should have been Paul that left.<p>>It might not make a good movie<p>s/good/feminist and this is my entire point.<p>Further,<p>>1. If they want to<p>It&#x27;s laughable to handwave away literal millennia of compulsory heterosexuality into &quot;if they want to.&quot; Most women don&#x27;t have a choice in this matter and globally, women that attempt to choose otherwise are usually killed for it. I know lesbian women that avoid traveling entirely outside of the US, and limit where they go in the US heavily, because of this.<p>Not seeing this is an expression of both male and heterosexual privilege. This isn&#x27;t a thing you should take negatively, but it is a thing you should meditate on and maybe recompute some cached thoughts.<p>>2. If they want to<p>Similarly, most women don&#x27;t have a choice about whether to be in the background or not. Especially in technology, where the assumption is that only men are technical, so men talk to other men and systematically exclude women.<p>>3. Everyone should be kind and compassionate<p>Telling a woman to &quot;be kind and compassionate&quot; is a macro/microaggression because women are only seen as either compliant/motherly/etc., or bitches. Men and women acting exactly the same ways tend to be viewed as assertive and confident on the one hand, but bitches on the other hand.<p>It&#x27;s for these reasons that this doesn&#x27;t make a compelling feminist narrative. The facts of the situation don&#x27;t change the narrative structure. And since human memories decay to the prototype of the neural network over time, it doesn&#x27;t really matter what the details of this situation are, because they decay to an anti-feminist prototype.<p>>If a guy chose to stay out of the spotlight you wouldn&#x27;t consider that misandrist, but when a woman does it&#x27;s misogynist?<p>Well, misandry isn&#x27;t real, so no, but if a man decides consciously to take up less space and possibly use his male privilege to ensure that women in (say) his company have more space, that is a feminist act. This is a good practice for men and I encourage any men reading to try this at the next meeting. Keep track of who talks when, and ensure that you A.) talk less than every woman present, B.) redirect the conversation to women when they&#x27;re interrupted by men, and C.) point out when women&#x27;s ideas are restated by men as their own.<p>When a woman chooses not to take up space, it could be for a variety of reasons, and this in itself is not anti-feminist, but a mere lack of anti-feminism doesn&#x27;t make an action (or here, a narrative) feminist. Most often, the reason a woman will chose not to take up space is because she is being oppressed when she attempts to do so (and this is true whether she recognizes the pushback from men around her, or if she merely reacts non-consciously to social cues to take up less space and &quot;be less of a bitch&quot;).<p>Your example is ill-conceived also in that it attempts to derive valid feminist statements by switching genders. The only reason feminism exists is because there are tangible power and status differentials between the gender roles delineated by patriarchy, and specifically, that women are oppressed by men. The point of feminism is to do away with this difference, but until this happens it&#x27;s meaningless to say &quot;but X is true when gender=A, so it must be true when gender=(B!=A).&quot; Obviously the social expectations, supports, and barriers for men and women are different.<p>I suggest you read more about feminism from feminist women, starting in the 60&#x27;s and moving forward in time.",1447811228

IMO, they do a better job than any other Linux distro.<p>Debian also has a strict policy on decoupling libraries from programs. This means that when a security update is released (e.g. the security fix for latest libpng vulnerability), you only need to update a single package.<p>Finally, Debian aims to be stable, which means they&#x27;ll keep an eye out for vulnerabilities and backport fixes. This is done <i>instead</i> of forcing you to move between versions of software, which has the potential to break things, or create new security issues (e.g. changes in config).<p>The Debian+openssl vulnerability happened in 2008. Go back, and look at Debian&#x27;s security record (e.g. go to LWN and see Debian release fixes for the latest vulnerabilities just as quickly as Red Hat and Canonical/Ubuntu).",1447811065

See below.<p><i>> If you wish to convict someone a la the lady of justice, then yes, I do believe you need logical arguments and theories before you can do anything (in regards to punishment).</i><p>But if you believe the justice analogy is &quot;inept&quot; (your word), why would you buy into someone else&#x27;s interpretation of YC rejecting an applicant as &quot;punishment&quot;? It&#x27;s not. As I said before, nobody has a right to YC funding. Their money, their choice. They don&#x27;t have to give a logical reason; they don&#x27;t have to give a reason at all.

But what they do do, including the &quot;Social Radar&quot;, does appear to work well, even if no one can construct a logical argument for why it does. Since it&#x27;s their money, and it&#x27;s working well for them, nobody else has any right to complain that they&#x27;re being &quot;punished&quot; if YC rejects them.

But I&#x27;m not sure it would be any worse than the current situation. Also with batch auctions there can be multiple collocation points in different cities.<p>But when the external information is released earlier in the window (which should be just as likely if random, and maybe even mandated for press releases to occur at the beginning of the window) the playing field between collocated HFT and smaller traders is much more level than the current situation.<p>But most information used in trading isn&#x27;t from external sources, its from the order book itself. Collocated HFT with 1ms latency can read the book, calculate next move (let&#x27;s say 20ms), and submit new order in 1 + 20 + 1 = 22ms. A trader with 100ms latency and the same system would take 220ms to respond.<p>This is where most of the HFT advantage comes from, they can see the order book and respond before it even arrives at your computer. With a batch auction everyone sees the previous results at the beginning of the window and has 1s to respond. Low latency is still desirable to allow for more processing, but its no longer overpowered.<p>edit: 1 sec was chosen completely arbitrarily, the best choice could be more or less, or even a random sized window.",1447809822

This means that outer synapses can provide &#x27;context&#x27;, e.g. indicate that prior steps in a sequence have been recognised, while inner synapses can cause firing if the context is fulfilled, i.e. context + necessary condition (recognition of the most recent step in the sequence) = action potential.<p>It&#x27;s not computationally surprising, but it is a specific cellular mechanism.",1447808599

Your issue is not that you don&#x27;t have the patience to wait for five seconds: it is that during those five seconds you are doing something useless instead of something else important.<p>In all seriousness, once you stop thinking of &quot;patience&quot; as &quot;I need to be able to sit on my hands and wait&quot; and instead think of it as &quot;I now have the opportunity to do something else for the next period of time that I should try to make as productive as I can&quot;, I don&#x27;t think ADHD is the problem anymore: the issue is making sure you always have a fun productive side task. You might find yourself accidentally doing things you realize later had low value for the time, but at least you got something done, right?<p>Put another way, you should embrace ADHD, not fight it: once you get into the habit of distracting yourself with just another task, the 5-10 seconds of compile time no longer matters, as you routinely switch to another task for five minutes every time you compile and it doesn&#x27;t matter how long the compile took.

Twelve game pieces are used, which according to the ancient rules are six white and six black. There are also two &quot;fish&quot; pieces, which are placed in the water. The throwing of the dice is done with a jade. The two players take turns to throw the dice and move their pieces. When a piece has been moved to a certain place it is stood up on end, and called an &quot;owl (梟or驍) &quot;. Thereupon it can enter the water and eat a fish, which is also called &quot;pulling a fish&quot;. Every time a player pulls a fish he gets two tokens, and if he pulls two fish in a row he gets three tokens [for the second fish]. If a player has already pulled two fish but does not win it is called double-pulling a pair of fish. When one player wins six tokens the game is won.</i><p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liubo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liubo</a>",1447808430

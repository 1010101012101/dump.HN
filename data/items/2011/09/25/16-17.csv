We find that firms open new satellite offices based on the success rate of venture capital-backed investments in an area. Geography is also significantly related to outcomes. Venture capital firms based in locales that are venture capital centers outperform, regardless of the stage of the investment. Ironically, this outperformance arises from outsized performance outside of the venture capital firms' office locations, including in peripheral locations. Outperformance of non-local investments suggests that policy makers in regions without local venture capitalists might want to mitigate costs associated with established venture capitalists investing in their geographies rather than encouraging the establishment of new venture capital firms. 42 pages.""<p>Direct link to PDF is <a href=""http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/09-143.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/09-143.pdf</a>",1316969060

According to a Cisco survey, many feel exactly that way.\nRate This Article:\nPoor Best\nE-mail<p>Print<p>PDF Version<p>The results of a revealing survey from Cisco suggest the Internet has become such an integral part of our functionality that it is deemed as important to our lives as water, food or air. The ""2011 Cisco Connected World Technology Report"" found that more than half the study's respondents said they could not live without the Internet and cite it as an ""integral part of their lives""in some cases more crucial than cars, dating, andhorror of horrorspartying.<p>One of every three college students and employees surveyed globally (33 percent) believes the Internet is a fundamental resource for the human raceas important as air, water, food and shelter. Nearly half (49 percent of college students and 47 percent of employees) believe it is ""pretty close"" to that level of importance. Combined, four of every five college students and young employees believe the Internet is vitally important as part of their daily lives' sustenance.<p>Two-thirds of students (66 percent) and more than half of employees (58 percent) cite a mobile device (laptop, smartphone or tablet) as ""the most important technology in their lives."" In addition, smartphones are poised to surpass desktops as the most prevalent tool from a global perspective, as 19 percent of college students consider smartphones their ""most important"" device used on a daily basis, compared with 20 percent for desktopsan indication of the growing trend of smartphone prominence and the expected rise in usage by the next generation of college graduates upon entering the workforce.<p>The finding also suggests the increasing prevalenceand sometimes intrusionof social networking in daily life. About nine out of 10 (91 percent) college students and employees (88 percent) globally said they have a Facebook account; of those, 81 percent of college students and 73 percent of employees check their Facebook pages at least once a day. A third said they check them at least five times a day.<p>College students reported constant online interruptions while doing projects or homework, such as instant messaging, social media updates and phone calls. In a given hour, more than four out of five (84 percent) college students said they are interrupted at least once. About one in five students (19 percent) said they are interrupted six times or morean average of at least once every 10 minutes. Additionally, 12 percent said they lose count how many times they are interrupted while they are trying to focus on a project.<p>In a sign that the boundary between work and personal lives is becoming thinner, seven of 10 employees ""friended"" their managers and/or co-workers on Facebook. Culturally, the United States featured lower percentages of employees friending managers and co-workersonly about 23 percentalthough 40 percent friended their co-workers.<p>The global study consists of two surveysone involving college students, the other on young professionals in their 20s. Each survey includes 100 respondents from each of 14 countries, resulting in a pool of 2,800 respondents. ""The lifestyles of prosumers'the blending of professionals and consumers in the workplacetheir technology expectations and their behavior toward information access is changing the nature of communications on a global basis, noted Dave Evans, Ciscos chief futurist.<p>The second annual ""Cisco Connected World Technology Report"" examines the relationship between human behavior, the Internet and networking's pervasiveness. It uses this relationship to provoke thoughts around how companies will remain competitive amid the influence of technology lifestyle trends. The global report, based on surveys of college students and professionals 30 years old and younger in 14 countries, provides insight into present-day challenges that companies face as they strive to balance current and future employee and business needs amid increasing mobility capabilities, security risks, and technologiesfrom virtualized data centers and cloud computing to traditional wired and wireless networks that can deliver information ubiquitously.",1316968576

Why not actually think of it in the proper terms?<p>Some combination of MVC and client-server is possible, but even then further specification is required to be clear about what you're doing, because the client/server can be placed in arbitrary locations in patterns, and particularly for web environments one must be careful to specify which components of the various elements are the canonical ones, where they live, and which are ultimately just cached copies.<p>Further it appears to be empirically the case that people who get MVC-happy begin to mistake MVC for being the one and sole and singular definition of <i>good design</i>, and start sticking it places it doesn't belong, while neglecting the proper design practices that should be used. MVC is actually a <i>brain bug</i>; seeing someone  go on about MVC is an almost 100% accurate marker for someone who doesn't deeply understand design at all, and just has a hammer and is hitting things with it.",1316968509

Mutations are the basis for creating new forms of the same species and whether it survives or dies depends on mutation and the environment. I wonder if this is what the researchers mean by designing drugs that target the 'resistance acquisition' - ie preventing cell replication.",1316966898

Facebook infests your life whether you want it or not and does not have a 'no thanks' or 'yes please' option that will kill all their cruft on a thousand and one websites. On a typical day of surfing you probably load their widgets 100's if not 1000's of times through all the sites that place the cruft on their pages. Whether or not you hit a page with a facebook widget on it is unknowable before you hit the page and facebook does not have a list of domains/hosts to blacklist either. And blacklisting is already beyond the capabilities of most internet users (which is really a sad thing, but you can bet that only a very tiny portion of the netizens knows where to find their 'hosts' file and how to make it do stuff for them).",1316966777

(Forking, on the other hand, is not something I'd recommend.) While not required, it's a really good idea to make friends with the community organizers and, ideally, find some way to contribute both code and funds upstream when you become successful - after all, your business is based on their continued existence.<p>That said, although it's certainly much harder to succeed under these terms, maintaining your own project is a valuable, rewarding experience, and gives you significantly more control over its direction.<p>Just remember that open source code has an accounting value of 0 - so any open source IP you create is not capturing value in the company, and unless you're careful, one-to-one professional services don't either. You'll have to figure out how to make your company valuable with valueless code another way. (Hosted services are a good example.)",1316966574

The first step towards a framework is having a controller than can serve up different views in different situations:  if your form doesn't validate,  you can serve the form up again or you can serve a different page if it does...  I remember the ""bad old days"" of cgi-script programming where the form and the form processor were in different scripts and you couldn't do server-side validation the right way.<p>Ruby has a particular strong role for the model,  which has some advantages and some disadvantages.",1316966567

The red square from Google+ is small and hidden in the place I usually don't even look, so I find myself not realizing for days that got a notification from Google+. On Facebook, notifications are one of the most useful features of the whole service - they tell me about the more important[1] events that I could otherwise miss (Facebook walls are heavily filtered; otherwise you'd be flooded by updates). And they don't even appear on your e-mail, unless I ask for it (Facebook has now disabled almost all e-mail notifications by default).<p>So I'm sorry, but I'm not convinced by this article. On the contrary, I find notifications to be one of the best UI solutions out there. They are completely noninvasive[2] and make sure you don't miss anything, so you don't have to constantly check what is going on. It boils down to what alexchamberlain said in the thread - event-based architecture beats polling in almost all cases.<p>[1] - if we can call anything on Facebook ""important"". But things like comments to my updates, or activities of my closest friends are things I don't want to miss.<p>[2] - Twitter, G+ and Facebook notifications are generally numbers on the webpage title / notification bar. They do not play sounds, they do not pop windows up. If one gets distracted by that, I recommend not keeping FB/Twitter/G+ tabs open in the browser during work.",1329757199

When tasked with inventing a new piece of the software, each designer, programmer, and manager tends to disregard all previous design decisions and create their own idea of what the project should look like. It's resulted in a totally inconsistent look, each page only bearing a passing semblance of the one before.<p>But a living style guide is worth nothing if the team members willfully choose to ignore it and pursue their own style agendas (and they are personal agendas, make no mistake). I've implemented some seriously ugly interfaces in the name of consistency, and the project is better for it.<p>The biggest hurdle is convincing management that this new flashy module simply does not mesh with the rest of the software. Design wants to impress, management is impressed, off to the nerds to implement it.",1329757051

Thanks for the comment.<p>It's subtle, but I think that most people outside of companies assume that decisions get made as you're describing above  separate questions of ""will this product be successful"", and ""will we make money out of it"". In part, the dilemma is borne out of the fact that for almost every company, those aren't separate questions at all. Think about it; you're the CEO, and someone comes along and says, ""let's invest this money in new R&D for a product that may, or may not, work. if, by chance, it does work... it will take out our existing product, and we'll end up making less money on the new product than we do right now on the old one"".<p>very few CEOs will put money down on that. they're using money from their cash cow to do what... to kill it?<p>the problem is one of perspective.<p>there's another famous example i love to quote when explaining: blockbuster and netflix. when netflix came along, blockbuster was this huge organization with massive margins and almost 100% name recognition. they looked at netflix, saw a new business emerging with a fraction of the margins that they had... why would they bother wasting their time on doing something like this? they could invest to create a netflix competitor, but if they did, it was going to cost them to do it, it may or may not be successful, and if it WAS successful, it would cannibalize their existing, high-margin business with one that was much less profitable. who would go for that?<p>the mistake that most companies make is that they assume that they're the only ones that are capable of challenging their existing business with a disruptive entrant. the problem is (and it sounds obvious, but so many successful companies have fallen into this trap): if they don't challenge themselves, then someone else will. from the perspective of blockbuster, with all these profitable stores dotted all around the country, the ""DVD by-mail market"" was not at all attractive. but to netflix, which was looking at the market from the perspective of ""we don't have any business at all, so any business is great"", the margins actually looked pretty good. blockbuster thought its choices were ""stick with high margin business, or move to low margin business"". but really, its choices were ""move to low margin business, or go bankrupt"".<p>that's the perspective thing i'm talking about; successful businesses have this tendency to view markets from the vantage point of where they stand right now. what's so noticeable about apple is that they <i></i>never<i></i> do that. they start from a fresh sheet of paper  what's best for the customer, not what's best from our bottom line. it's a mighty hard trick to pull off.<p>hope this helps. thanks to everyone for voting up the article.<p>cheers<p>-- james",1329756576

It's my currency and respect for others and their time is something I do my best to abide by.<p>When an app doesn't respect me, or my time, and interrupts me, it's indirectly saying it's more important than anything I'm working on.  It might not mean to, but it's like someone showing up at your desk demanding attention for their question without any regard for what you're working on.<p>Example: I just switched to a Galaxy Android phone from an older iOS phone.  This isn't Android's fault, I'm sure I'll find it elsewhere too.<p>My punishment for adding my accounts to a modern mobile OS? My notification center blinks like a Christmas tree.<p>I am a person that barely tolerates SMS or voicemail notifications. No problem is rarely that big that it can't wait an hour. Or two. Being the path of least resistance and being available to the whims of others simply leaves you drowned in more information than is humane.    It's better to reward people who make requests as far in advance as possible, and reward them with those quickest, preferred emails.<p>I run a consulting business that primarily develops products. I am, by the way of having good systems and processes, able to work with this rule.  I can reply to emails every few hours.  Emergencies, still get dealt with as emergencies.  Just put a Priority 1 in the subject of the email, or call the emergency voicemail, and it's a fire drill, with the minimum hour(s) we agree to every fire drill.<p>I don't care to receive a notification that a new meetup has been created.  I don't care I received an instant message right this second.  I wish Gtalk would stop harassing me for signing in with.  I'm scared to hook up my other IM accounts.<p>I don't care what a single app has to tell me right this instant.  Sorry, but it won't improve there quality of my life this instant, or the next 5 years.  It's just noise, 99% of the time.<p>If it's a new attention economy, I'm not going to let others decide the rules of how I spend my most valuable currency -- my attention so easily.  When I did, it robbed me of focus, productivity and momentum, and let others set the priorities in my life.  Theres no imagining how users who aren't aware of how they're being distracted and overwhelmed might overcome this.<p>I personally feel that part of this is the fault of the Blackberry culture that I watched in total horror: Blackberries made people feel like they were being more productive.<p>The too oft reality? blackberries are great for the people asking the questions. For the overwhelming majority that answer the questions for a living, they are now busy doing other peoples work. They are busy dealing with the poor planning of others now disguised as an emergency.<p>Only one thing.  Poor planning on your part doesn't make am emergency on my part. I now have to deal with this culture of interruption, packaged as notifications but it's just really lazy.  It's not a new economy, it's not a new world.  It's someone wanting to micromanage my time that doesn't understand my time. Thanks, but no thanks.<p>Sorry apps, but you aren't the center of my life, just because I installed you. You're not that important. I'm not that important, but I value my time and like feeling good about what I accomplish every day.<p>If I need your notifications I can turn them on.  Otherwise, quit being an attention seeker.

People use those kind of services, but it's hard to make a living making them (because of lack of widespread payment systems).<p>But the government invests heavily on software technologies (security/blocking/MITMing!), and all corporations/big businesses have to rely on home-made <i>solutions</i> (banks, hospitals, universities) Those areas are usually dominated by Microsoft technologies (.Net and SQL Server).<p>> <i>Do most computers use Linux?</i><p>Absolutely no. It's easy to crack Windows, Photoshop and Microsoft Word! And many (including myself) don't consider it unethical, as you can't buy them in any other way (I buy a lot through Mac/iTunes App Store, but mainly to support fellow developers and not because I consider it more ethical for my situation).<p>> <i>And if trading with Iran is illegal how would you buy an Apple or Dell machine anyway?</i><p>I think it's called <i>black market</i> (though I'm not sure if it applies to our situation or not). What I mean is that a guy buys 25 MacBooks in Hong Kong and ships them to Iran (they're all registered under his name) and then sells them <i>independently</i> of Apple, usually with a tasty premium (Apple products are really popular, but also more expensive than other brands.<p>> <i>Can you have gmail/blogger/twitter accounts or are US companies forbidden from giving you free accounts?</i><p>You usually can use them, but you can't register from Iran (you have to choose another country). But in case of most social things it doesn't matter, because they are blocked by the government anyway. Stuff like sf.net, code.google.com, and like of Oracle are more problematic; as they block Iranian IPs.<p>> <i>What languages are popular?</i><p>C#, ASP.Net, PHP, Java (for businesses). Hackers and hobbyists use whatever they feel like.<p>> <i>Is there a large internal market for software?</i><p>For end users? No. But for corporations and businesses (those I mentioned above), I don't think it's different than other places.<p>:)",1329756127

That's the easy part.<p>Now our implementation is a graph of small services (we call them nano-daemons) that slice a request into elementary tasks. nano-daemons communicate between them using messages that are copied around. This means a little memory overhead but absolutely no access contention. As you know C++ is very good at using the stack for that kind of allocation and the stack is FAST.<p>The actual content is only copied in the final phase into the network card's buffer. The reference counting is used to make sure the data is kept alive long enough, even if a parallel removal requested arrived meanwhile. The content isn't actually manipulated in parallel. An update implies the creation of a new buffer, reducing further the contention.<p>So in other words, if you have many parallel gets on the same data, you have, in theory, a little contention caused by the reference counter being incremented.<p>In practice, reference counting doesn't show up in profiling (so far). Actually most time is spent in the asynchronous callbacks waiting for I/O completion, something which we are very proud of! :)<p>We've benchmarked our software on a grid of 200 servers with 12 cores each and it does much better than other products, especially for entries larger than 8 kiB.<p>If you think about it, you realize that somehow, at some point, you will have a bottleneck, whatever design you choose.",1329755354

3612808,comment,3612357,3612357,1,0,drostie,,,"Questions 1, 2, and 3 are rather interesting and have what I'd judge to be reasonably correct answers. Question 4 is boring and questions 5 - 7 don't really have correct answers at all, which is a little surprising for Yahoo. Who messes up their technical geekery this bad?<p>Question 1 can be done by first renumbering all weights under w = 55 + x, so that in x-space the equivalent problem is [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11].<p>The benefit of starting with 0 is that you know that the first two numbers are -k and +k, because they have to sum to 0. They aren't both 0, so starting with -1 and +1 gives you the answer pretty simply in a generative way: you say ""the next largest number I need to make is 2, that requires 2 - (-1) = 3, the next largest number I need to make is 3, that requires 3 - (-1) = 4, the next largest number I need to generate is 6, which requires 7, check that I'm done, I am, so there you have it, (54, 56, 58, 59, 62).<p>Question 2 requires calculating the two line extrema which aren't triangles: 12 - 5 = 7, 12 + 5 = 17. Then rule out the middle zone where (5, 12, x) is acute -- this happens between the two right triangles (5, 12, 13) and (5, 10.908..., 12). So we rule out (11, 12, 13) and we're left with (8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 16), which has length 6.<p>Question 3 required a bit of mental insight. Let f(n, x) mean ""the numer of ways to form x with bills denoted 1, 2, ..., n"". Then f(1, x) = 1 and f(n, negative) = 0, and f(n, 0) = 1.<p>Then there is a recursion relation: you can either form x using the largest bill n, or you can form it without; the number of ways to do it the first way is f(n, x - n) and the number of ways to do it the second way is f(n - 1, x). Thus:<p><pre><code>   f(n, x) = f(n, x - n) + f(n - 1, x)
</code></pre>
Which means, following the recursion:<p><pre><code>   f(n, x) = f(n - 1, x) + f(n - 1, x - n) + ...
</code></pre>
For n = 2 it's clear that f(2, x) = ceil((x+1)/2), just following out the pattern. All you need to know is that asymptotically this is x/2. This means that f(3, x) will sum for large x a set of linearly increasing terms. They will average x/4, since they start pretty much at 0 and go pretty much to x/2. There will be x/3 terms. So the sum must asymptotically grow like x^2/12.<p>So, right, question 5. The first of the stupid questions. As far as I can tell the loop intended is while(0);, and because it loops precisely zero times, every predicate -- even the false predicates -- are true all of the times that it loops. All five options are technically correct. (And even if we restrict them to the ones which happen when the loop decides that it's not going to happen in the first place, there still seem to be multiple true assertions.)<p>Question 6 is bad first off because it starts with an incomplete and irrelevant sentence; the question has no single answer because it depends on what the exact model is on disk. If you store all the records in a single file on disk, and you only naively count disk IOs, then in principle the lookup without the B+ tree can be done in <i>one long</i> disk IO whereas with the lookup <i>with</i> the B+ tree will probably take more disk IOs as we skip the irrelevant parts to save memory. (This is especially true if the B+ tree is stored on disk alongside those records, since the access pattern would be highly nonlinear.) If they're in different files scattered across the drive then that's a different question, and the unindexed content needs to query all N records, requiring you to request N separate IOs, while the indexed content does not ever need, as far as I'm aware, to backtrack, and therefore can do it in N or fewer IOs.<p>Question 7 is also horrible because it only has a valid answer under the assumption that peoples' marks are unique, and the most obvious way to make this assumption is to assume that the kids are being marked 1 for top place, 2 for second place, et cetera. If they are being marked with normal grades, some kid gets 100, another kid gets 98, two kids get 97, and so on -- then uniqueness is trashed and none of the answers are valid. First off, it's not the ""8th highest mark"" in the sense of the ""8th highest person with the highest mark"" because that person might share a mark with the 7th highest person, and therefore would not fulfill the NOT IN clause. It is not the ""8th highest mark"" in the sense of the ""8th highest mark awarded"" because the inner select is not UNIQUE and therefore there is no good way to say how many unique marks there are therein.<p>After that many screwups on Yahoo's part I just decided that this test annoyed the crap out of me. I try not to program in C when I can help it, which turns out to fortunately be most of the time, so the barrage of questions about what exactly certain C programs do would be educated guesses anyway.",1329754765

Obviously basic concurrency primitives will allow trivial concurrent code if a fixed set of memmory pages are simply allocated and then assigned a fix isolation level e.g. via a allocation of a large array that fits in L3 and is forever resident.<p>However if the data set is constantly changing, because either you are churning through a lot of short lived memory objects or you have structures e.g. trees spanning a very large number of pages, then you have a memory management problem to address.   Either way you are constantly blowing your L2 (and possibly L3) caches.  Naturally, limiting those page swaps is the key to high performance.  Concurrency exacerbates this demand (which is present even for single threaded servers) by placing isolation requirements on pages and data.  So the name of the game is memory page management, e.g. ""GC"" in  Dr. Click speak.  His choice of telegraphic word is also highly informed:  he is nailing the fact that removal of garbage is basically what the allocators all must struggle with and that the GC makes or breaks the allocator (for such high performance systems).<p>So I would flip Click's pithy statement and state verbosely:<p><i>High performance concurrent computing's requirement for data locality and isolation inevitably require very sophisticated memory allocation and memory pool management sub-systems.  And beyond simple but effective heuristics such as object creation time (for locality) any further significant gains to be had can only be delivered by the garbage collection mechanisms of the memory manager.</i>",1329754474

As his biography shows, Steve Jobs was always focused on new products but took a long time to learn that profitability was essential to success. The Lisa, the original Macintosh and the Next cube were unprofitable. Had he not learned that excellence must come with a price premium, Jobs would have been a business failure. Once he learned this, well, look at the telephone handset market. Apple enjoys a small slice of the volume and the lion's share of the profits in the entire industry.",1329754139

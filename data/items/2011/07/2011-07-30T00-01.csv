2824482,comment,2822264,2824286,2,0,Jach,,,"Calm down a bit, man. I've got a MongoDB mug sitting on my desk. I think you'd agree that even if the data structure fits into a key-value model more so than a relational one, that still doesn't mean you need NoSQL, and if you take a common definition of ""big data"" to mean ""your data needs exceed the capabilities of a single machine"", then a lot of people don't need all that scalability. (And if it did, you'd use Hadoop anyway. =P ) (There's also CAP Theorem considerations for added fun. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem</a> )<p>There was a presentation up here a few months ago on how the guys at <a href=""http://wordsquared.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordsquared.com/</a> used MongoDB; they basically made the choice since they knew it already, instead of using postgres with their great geo libraries. And that's fine. What's stupid is when people who know one or the other pretty well spend a lot of time learning about the other for a use case that's most likely not really necessary anyway, or their current choice could handle with tweaks.<p>Of course, once public CS starts moving forward into innovative big analytics rather than just managing big data storage (such as the theta-join paper I linked elsewhere on this page), things may start shifting in favor of one of the NoSQL systems and the above quote would be equally suitable when comparing the Hadoop ecosystem or Mongo with some fancy new relational DB.",1311987383

2824477,comment,2818349,2823211,2,0,nate_meurer,,,"> ""I am defining software as a tangible thing, existing as a pattern of matter and fields.""<p>Ok, but that means you're not talking about software patents any more.  The U.S. patent office currently cares nothing about patterns of matter and fields.<p>> ""And that [a complete physical timer] is exactly what is covered by a valid software patent.""<p>No, wrong.  That's how it <i>should</i> be, but it's not, and that's the problem.  Officially, patent law isn't supposed to allow patents on ""abstract ideas"", but due to incomplete guidance from the courts, the requirements have been diluted to nothing.  Right now in the U.S., a software patent application can satisfy the requirements by specifying any trivial physical step.  Most software patents specify only a ""computing device"" on which the software is used.  Well gee whiz, guess what that covers?  You got it, everything!  It's useless language; there's no narrowing, no added specificity.  It would be just as usefull to specify ""software in Her Majesty the Queen's service"".  As a result, for the past 20 years the USPTO has essentially been granting patents on pure software.<p>A patent on a laser interferometer that encodes instructions is no longer a software patent; that would be covered by a mechanical patent.  And this patent certainly would be in conflict with any software patents that covered the software encoded thereby, if the interferometer were ever put to use in a product.",1311987221

2824457,comment,2823742,2823806,45,0,raldi,,,"> As a fun exercise, you could rewrite this list so it sounds helpful and polite rather than rude and egotistical.<p>Okay:<p>-----<p>Hi! I bet you're super nervous about meeting me, but please don't be -- I'm just a big dork. And don't take it personally if I'm terse or appear impatient with you. 99% of my time is spent in meetings, so it's extremely helpful if we both skip straight to the point .. or ""cut the bullshit"", as my grandmother used to say. Here are some other tips:<p>If you have bad news, please just come right out and tell me immediately. I promise I won't blame the messenger, and I might even know a quick fix. If we have a regularly-scheduled meeting, don't wait for it; interrupt me with time-critical issues. Also, don't be afraid to ask questions or disagree with me; I promise I won't get upset. If, post-meeting, you find yourself regretting not having spoken up or asked a question, come right back and correct that problem. I'm a big follower of the philosophy that there are no stupid questions.<p>I've found note-taking to be extremely fruitful. Please bring a pen and paper anytime you meet with me; it impresses the heck out of me when someone catches everything the first time and I don't have to repeat myself.<p>If you have an appointment with me, and I'm in another meeting, go right ahead and interrupt it. Your time is important, too. But be prepared for someone to do this if <i>our</i> meeting runs late.<p>Often, there's only about five minutes of real content in a meeting. If so, there's no need to stretch it out. I appreciate such micro-meetings. You can foster them by identifying in advance what decision needs to be made and sending it around in advance. And don't be surprised if I make everyone stand.<p>I don't really like long emails. Instead, consider a micro-meeting, and set an agenda if it's a complicated issue. Then stick to that agenda!<p>Micro-update emails are great, though. I've found them to be effective for confirming commitments and mutual understanding. This is especially true after a meeting: It's super-helpful to get a (brief!) list of your agreed-upon commitment echoed back to me. I don't always respond to such messages, but I read every one. Oh, and to save time, please skip the greetings, ""thank you""s, etc. (You'd be surprised how much time this saves on my phone's ""message preview"" screen.)<p>Finally, a few quickies:<p>* Instead of ""It's being worked on"", tell me when you expect it will be done. That's what I really want to know.<p>* List all the options, and tell me which you recommend. This is especially important if you come to me with a problem -- but if you don't have a solution yet, skip this step rather than delaying the news.<p>* Economic analyses are the best supporting arguments. (I insist on them when money is involved.)<p>* Don't worry about making reports for me, but if you do, check out the spreadsheets I've made and try to copy their design.<p>* Don't send me long documents. (Yes, I realize the irony.)<p>-----<p>You might think all the ""please""s and other friendly words make my version too fluffy, but it's actually about 500 words <i>shorter</i> than the original.",1311986792

2824455,comment,2824240,2824374,6,0,jmtame,,,"According to the founders, Airbnb has offered to cover her losses all along, from the very beginning. If that's true, and in fact she rejected the help and rejected meeting with the founders as she claims she did, then Airbnb did everything it could do in its power to help. Airbnb has nothing to apologize for if all of that is true.<p>As much as I sympathize with the unlucky and unfortunate circumstances of the victim, the ultimate responsibility lies on the renters. This is going to happen again as Airbnb grows bigger and more people join the site; it's inevitable, just as there exists crime in people's homes now. If you're planning to rent out your apartment for a week, you really should meet the rentee in person, take steps to secure your own possessions from possible theft in advance, and secure the proper insurance (whether that's obtained through a future Airbnb offering or privately through an insurance company). When you rent a hotel room, they typically provide a safe lock because the same risk of getting your possessions stolen exists; this is no different.<p>I'm not trying to be dismissive of the victim, it really sucks this happened to EJ and the Airbnb team has been very open to offering help from what I've noticed lately. Fortunately, justice was served to the perpetrator, which is the important part. What EJ needs to do now is press charges and sue Faith Clinton for emotional damage and theft. I don't know how much the press will pursue this, and who knows how much it will affect Airbnb's reputation. I have a feeling this will blow over and I think Airbnb has made it clear they're willing to help as long as EJ will accept it; it wouldn't affect my own willingness to rent personally because I know after 2 million nights you're probably bound to have a few lunatics. Interestingly, someone in the previous threads accurately predicted it was a meth tweaker who fit the profile of the ransacking.",1311986705

Unfortunately, the last few months (and especially after installing Lion) those misgivings have been growing stronger, and I'm definitely uncomfortable with what seems to be their increasing indifference to pro users. I don't object to making things easier by <i>hiding</i> features, but I do object to doing so by removing features entirely -- for example, the way Expose and Spaces were gimped in favor of Mission Control in Lion. It's easier for the average user, but it's really messed with the way I manage windows and applications, and I quite honestly Do Not Like It. Anecdotally, from talking to a few friends who are also power user types, they hate it as well.<p>At any rate, I've been thinking more and more lately about switching back to an all-Windows environment. My day job is web development on the .NET platform, and I generally love C# and ASP.NET MVC -- they are just a fantastic environment to work in. Since I already have all the tools, there'd be no real burden to switching back to all-Windows. Lately, I've really been thinking about using my MSDN sub to bootcamp the MBP, or maybe just selling off the MBP entirely for a T420 or Samsung Series 9. I do really like the MBP's hardware and especially the trackpad, but now that we're finally seeing Clickpad-equipped laptops coming out that's much less of an issue for me.<p>Mind you, this is all just my opinion. Others may disagree, and I'm sure they will. :)",1311984167

However, when you facilitate a transaction, there is an expectation that you are working to the satisfaction of both parties involved. If you give your credit card to a merchant and they ring up extra charges, it isn't the credit card companies 'fault', but you both want them to know about the issue and expect them to take care of it for you.<p>I think in the end this is a huge opportunity for AirBnB. They are getting tons of press that they otherwise wouldn't get, and in this case their is no such thing as bad PR (I don't believe that to always be the case).<p>As more people are likely to be renters than rentees, this might for a short time limit the availability of accommodation, if renters are concerned about their property. But more renters will become aware of AirBnB and in the not too distant future people will remember something about a renter who's property got damaged and it was a big deal. That memory may actually be a good thing! The details will be forgotten, but it may be remembered that something happened and AirBnB had to take care of it.<p>As a home owner, if you are looking to rent out your place and your options are 1) a site you haven't heard of 2) a site that gained world-wide exposure when there was an incident regarding damage to a persons property, wouldn't you be inclined to go with the one that people are paying attention to?<p>Rock stars trash a lot of hotel rooms, nobody blames or avoids the hotels.",1311984163

One could just as easily assume that the ""system"" in the case of the space shuttle begins with flight and rocketry and the transistor and ends with NASA in Houston flinging a few tons of crap, and a couple of humans, into space and then bringing most of it back down again, usually intact.  The software in question was made up of many pieces, many of which were proven useful and correct as parts of prior systems, such as the Apollo rocket guidance systems.<p>However, if we really take it to that extreme, I guess we'd end up with every ""system"" starting with fire and the wheel.  So, I think it should perhaps be ""Gall's truism"", or ""Gall's rule of thumb"", though it doesn't have quite the same ring to it.  It isn't quite provable, but can't really be argued against very effectively, either.  And, you know, if you pretend like it's a law, it probably won't have negative consequences, while convincing yourself it is false very likely <i>will</i> have negative consequences.",1221379110
303642,story,,,17,51,h34t,"Ask HN: Who do you respect, and why?",,"People here seem to diverge from mainstream in how we value achievements -- in how we define what is truly 'prestigious' and what is merely faking / pathetic.<p>Google lets us make snap judgments on people dozens of times a day. When you google someone, what grabs your attention most? What do <i>you</i> consider to be prestigious, or worthy of respect? ...examples?<p>And the converse: What do you see people emphasizing about themselves over and over again, which actually signal they ""just don't get it""? (What do people do in their online/public lives that you think are really stupid?)",1221378684

The equivalent of cracking a smart joke to the girl next to you at the bar: You both know what you're after, but neither of you can know whether you want to be with each other until somebody makes the first move and gets the ball rolling (which should NOT be a summary of your entire life's experience). That's all this is; I applaud.",1221377802

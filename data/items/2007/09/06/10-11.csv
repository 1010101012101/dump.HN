Many YC startups have switched their idea even during the initial 3 months.<p>But you imply that if you keep switching ideas, it's guaranteed that soon you'll come up with the right one.  What if you don't?  How then do you account for the time?  Where do you get the money that you spent back?  There needs to be a clear line - if young kids are dropping everything and moving to Boston, that situation can only be maintained for so long.  How do you determine when that is before that becomes personally ruinous.  I see that a note is left that YC funded hundreds of startups.  Great.  how many went anywhere?  What happens to the rest?  Are they still in Boston?  Did they move back?  Can they still attend YC dinners? Does Paul still take their calls if they don't make it?  Or are they in some weird limbo where they need to go back to ""real life"" but have to account for lost time and opportunities?  Paul is not your father nor is he the father of any of these young people trying this.  If you make it, great!  But if you don't ... (sounds of crickets).  Well let's just say I doubt he'll offer you room and board until you find the next thing or get back on your feet.<p>>> It's fairly common for a failing idea to still be a failing idea 10 years later.<p>Yes it is.  It's also fairly common for a failing idea to become a huge hit on the 11th year because something in society changed.  Entrepreneurs are usually a bit more right-brain oriented and can see patterns in social dynamics which is why they are more likely than others to predict how to profit from emerging patters.  But predicting a change and timing it exactly are two different things, as anyone on Wall Street will tell you.<p>>> Many YC startups have switched their idea even during the initial 3 months.<p>That's my point exactly.  How do you determine if you're wasting time or just one idea switch away?  What if by the time you hit your idea the market is in the course of moving away from it?  Do you get invested in continuously to keep trying?  Who's paying your personal bills during this time?  Does Paul write a letter explaining what you've been up to for 6 months if you go back to school?  Are there companies in Boston that will hire you if you don't make it so you can stay around while you think of the next YC idea?",1189076196
51024,comment,50456,50456,0,0,LaurieCheers,,,"I think Paul's logic here is subtly backwards...<p>""It doesn't matter much where a given individual went to college.""<p>From Y-Combinator's perspective, yes, I'm sure that's true. The people they're looking at are self-selected, and pretty much guaranteed to be smart, motivated and well-educated, which means that all Y-Combinator needs to do is worry about how they think - not where they were taught.\nBut that's after the fact. To someone deciding what college to go to, or where to send their children, I think the choice is still very important.<p>""someone with a real thirst for knowledge will be able to find a few smart people to learn from at a school that isn't prestigious at all.""\nTrue, of course. But where does that thirst for knowledge come from? With the right support, or the right teachers, perhaps that party animal would have changed his ways. As far as I'm concerned, _that_ is really the purpose of good schools.<p>In Y-Combinator terms, it's not that they make a founder more likely to succeed: it's that they make him more likely to try being a founder in the first place.",1189076019

911732,comment,911170,911170,0,0,rick_2047,,,"Well all my school life I have had some great English/Hindi literature teachers. I may be safe in saying that I have learned problem solving from them. They were not of the types which tell you to learn the poem or prose by heart.Give prepared notes on certain lines and then tell you to rote learn them.They told us how to get to heart of a story.On of my most experienced teacher(our batch was her last,she retired at the age of 60 I think),told us that just reading a story is a disgrace in itself to the author [when you are in a Literature class].Every story was a part of his/her life when he/she wrote it.Every poem was a real emotion when it was laid out on paper.She used to throw random books at us (on me sometime literally), told us to ""understand"" them. Then we had this huge discussion over the plot and how this can be interpreted or how that is misinterpreted by most people.Those were one of the best days of my school life.<p>Now this may seem not a particular type of ""problem solving"" to some people. But it is when you take it seriously.You get the same sensation when you make a perfect connection between an event in the authors life and how he interpreted it in his story,that you get when you solve a mathematical problem.Because these two have essentially the same procedure.1)Finding the roots of the problem ,2)Understanding the roots of the problem,3)Interpreting the roots of the problem,4)Using those to solve the problem. Perhaps that's why one of my Maths professor used to say ""Look at the problem,its screaming its solution to you"".",1256892935

I am pleased to say that over four years, there were only a couple of times when I think we lost a sale because of corrupt tactics by a competitor and even then, I can't be sure. Certainly, we sold a fair amount of software and didn't have to bribe anyone. These were small deal sizes though, less than ~$50k and I think corruption probably gets more prevalent with larger deals. Certainly I have seen much more questionable behavior in other businesses such as consulting and outsourcing which is why I wouldn't want to spend my days selling those kinds of services.",1256892859

Everyone has their idea of ""style"" but if it feels like I have to make <i>effort</i> to digest any kind of content, its a huge turn off. Being organized and tidy solves this problem more times than not.<p>-- Simple, Clear and Understandable.<p>Language is beautiful. Conveying concepts whether in words, pictures, video, etc, is <i>hard</i>. Websites that don't give a crap about the quality of their message turn me off, if they don't care, why should I?<p>-- Scoped.<p>I have mentioned how important scoping is in a couple of ""review my website"" posts. It has to do with how organization is displayed and sorted within your website. A nice example of proper scoping is stack overflow, and it takes tons of work. Stackoverflow has a ""global"" page where questions from all categories are sorted by votes, time, and responses. Drilling down into a specific tag or category narrows the <i>scope</i> of the information you see. All the filters and sorting work on a unified interface but only the <i>scope</i> changes. Lots of websites have scoping problems. Why are weirdo arbitrary global links/functions contained on a side navigation when I am in a particular subset of the site/data?<p>Headers, footers, left/right panels can all be designed to reflect proper scope. Maybe you want global stuff present everywhere. Well make the container clearly and consistently represent a global interface. Don't use things for both just for the hell of it.<p>-- Engaging.<p>Hard to explain possibly, but I like to think that a website has its doors open and it looks like people are actively enjoying themselves inside. You would not paint your local ice cream shop entirely black, board up all the windows, close the door, and expect people to feel welcomed.<p>I personally like minimalistic design, but that does not mean I don't use and like sites like <a href=""http://wufoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wufoo.com</a><p>Ok thats all!",1256892728

For a silly example, one cloud and another cloud do not make two clouds, but one bigger one.<p>But more philosophical, it's the question of `oneness' that problematic.  How can you define objects?  All edges are arbitrary and if you look close enough they even blur.<p>(Of all the numbers the `natural' numbers are the most unnatural.

911717,comment,911170,911170,0,0,silkodyssey,,,"I think all jobs require problem solving to some degree just that some jobs are easier than others and others while not necessarily easy are sufficiently well defined to enable a worker to develop expertise in that area. And with expertise in a field problems are often solved intuitively without going through all the ""problem solving mechanics"".<p>Getting to this point where problems can be solved intuitively can sometimes take years of study and practice. We can look at this as an investment. A person invests time and energy in wiring his or her brain to solve a particular set of problems and after achieving this goal the person is left with little desire to repeat the process for another problem domain. A doctor may apply problem solving skills to diagnose and treat a rare disease but may not be able muster the effort required to learn photoshop. It's not due to a lack of problem solving abilities but more of a desire to step not out of their problem solving comfort zone.",1256892206

This group of people is the natural customer for Ubuntu and i believe the vast majority of them go back to their previous O.S simply because the default fonts for them are not Windows-like.
My point is Ubuntu would better serve its ""natural customer"" by focussing on making the O.S look good for this group of people i.e. look Windows-like by default, rather than other newer features.",1256891193

Admittedly there are a vocal minority of geeks that grew up with the former type of font rendering, but even they seem to limit this preference to coding fonts and even they seem to be leaving this behind as dpis go up.<p>If you want OS X rendering on Linux you can have it today, without patented code, or the need for meticusously hinted fonts (which makes them much easier to produce as open source).<p>It basically involves going into the advanced Gnome font controls turning off all hinting. Voila! ""Blurry"" Mac OS X style font rendering. You can add sub-pixel rendering to taste.<p>You can also make it look like XP, which I personally think is a bit retrograde and ironically this <i>does</i> require well-hinted fonts (like Microsoft's) and patented code.<p>There's a how-to here:

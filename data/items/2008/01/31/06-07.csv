One of them is that everyone has perfect knowledge of all options.  If someone doesn't know about you, they can't choose you.  This is why marketing adds so much value - you become an option and your technical merits have a chance to shine.  If you market something crappy, you'll only succeed if no one knows about the better alternative.",1201762751

There was always a lot of future-looking hot air when I was in school about how location-aware content delivery was the thing to do.  It really was a lot of hot air because nobody really wants the kind of content you'd put on such a stream.  But say you're standing in line for a Sox game (Red, White, doesn't matter which) and they've got a list of upcoming home games posted.  Snap the barcode next to a game time/date to go to the ticket sales site for that day.  On your way out, when you're at the bus stop, snap the barcode to get an estimate of when the next bus will arrive.  Simple.<p>If I were a band, and I knew that cell phone calendar/event managers supported iCal event files, I'd put barcodes that directed people to the file on my website, so my next show would show up on their calendars.",1201759651

So I'm asking, are there any good annotations tools out there? What are the references?",1201759633

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; but who does actually strive to do the deed; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.""<p>Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919)",1201759530

If your flight requires an aircraft that is arriving from another city where there is a weather problem, or even if there was a weather problem earlier in your city and now the backlog of flights is greater than the number of arrivals and departures that an airport can handle, the delays can stack up over multiple cities. The airlines can't afford to keep equipment (and crew!) buffers at each airport to absorb these delays.",1201759378

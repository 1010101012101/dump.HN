I'm thinking of taking a time off from school after graduation (before taking MD) to pursue my idea.<p>The question arises when I figured out that it seems that tech startup founders are expected to be coders and CS grads. I am a hobbyist coder myself (have been programming since my IS class on highschool) and I have developed a (very) rough prototype of several of my ideas but certainly it ain't as pretty when compared to a code written by a guy that wrote their own kernel on assembly for CS class.<p>So what do you think about this situation? Should I just continue and deal with the non-technical founder dilemma? Or is going back to college for a CS/engineering degree worth it?<p>Ohh and even on the non-startup field, I still wonder how many non-coder are in the high tech industry.

Would their psychologists form diagnostic handbooks for the clearly maladaptive trait of aggressive interpersonal contact, or trusting another person to watch their children?<p>Bonus question: if you're religiously inclined, do the deities of your choice love and respect these societies?

Besides, orthogonal vectors don't get you to the same place. ;-)<p>In my opinion, the defining feature of a plugin is that it can be loaded and used with no modification of the code that uses it.  On architectures with dynamic loading, this means you can drop a DSO somewhere and use it without code modification or relinking.  ""Factories"", as usually described, would require some modification of the factory to support this new implementation (perhaps just a single line).  A ""factory"" with a runtime-extensible list of implementations that it knows about, is a plugin architecture, but a plugin architecture need not look anything like a factory.",1268934182

They cool it down so they can distinguish the ground and first excited states.<p>The oscillator is piezoelectric, so they can get a current from it that depends on the frequency of the oscillation, and this enables it to be coupled to the qubit device.<p>The Josephson junction has two phases, superconducting and non-superconducting.  The junction in a circuit behaves like an oscillating circuit.  Transitions between these phases occur at certain resonant frequencies which depend on the current applied.  The resonant frequencies are quantised and you can have a superposition of the states, and that's why this is a qubit.  The splitting between these quantum states depends on the current.<p>Coupling the piezoelectric oscillator with the qubit allowed them to drive a circuit at frequencies that could change the qubit state.  Conversely, the state of the qubit can set the vibrational state of the oscillator.  Since you
can set the qubit in a superposition of the ground and first excited state, the ground and first excited states of the oscillator i.e. not vibrating and vibrating, are also superposed.",1268933813

I think that will never change.  What will change is how we approach these tasks.<p>Try this mental trick: avoid judgments.  Simply see your day as a web of causes and effects.  If I do X, Y will happen.  If I don't do X, Y will not happen.  Don't tell yourself ""I <i>need</i> to do X.""  Give yourself permission to not do things if you are fine with the consequences.<p>Here's another thing to think about: saying ""I want"" is a fiction, because we are a complicated bundle of desires that sometimes conflict.  We desire basic physical things like comfort as well as more complex things like a coherent and good sense of self.  Get to know your desires.  Why do you bite your fingernails?  There is a kinesthetic side of you trying to express itself.  Why do you want to avoid work?  Perhaps there is a chance of failure so your ego's desire to protect itself is putting on the brakes.  Or perhaps the work is simply boring and your inner child wants some adventure.  The skill here is, after you get to know your inner desires, to learn how to harmonize them.  It's like managing people:  try to come to an outcome where everyone gets what they want, if possible.  If you like the feeling of biting your fingernails but there's a part of you that doesn't like the habit, then you have an internal conflict.  An unenlightened way to deal with this is to simply try to snuff out the habit (willpower to stop doing it).  A better way is to find something else that's as kinesthetically pleasing and that you don't find objectionable.  Same thing goes for programming:  if a part of you wants to do that task and a part of you doesn't, listen to the opposing desires and try to harmonize them.",1268932147

On the OS X 10.5 box I'm sitting at right now, the 'libpython2.6.a' static library from my source build of Python 2.6 is over 6 MB. The actual 'python' binary is nearly 2 MB, and stripped of all debugging symbols, still comes in at about 1.4 MB.<p>If you had some <i>really</i> good compression, and included only a small part of the standard library, I can see getting a CPython package in around the 2-3 MB mark, but not much more.",1268931782

I read this bit <a href=""http://hginit.com/02.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hginit.com/02.html</a> from Joel's Mercurical intro, and it sounds a lot like how I use svn, except that the branches are on the server, so they are probably a little slower, with the positive tradeoff of being available to my team.  The other bonus with dvcs is having local history without doing pushes, which I think is a bigger selling point (although I get something similar from my IDE).<p>I generally hew to the extreme programming view of branching and continuous integration. Push early and push often. Browsing github, I seem to find a preponderance of projects where the branches are never push-ed back to a master copy.  No matter what tool you are using, branches can introduce semantic changes that are hard to merge.<p>To sum, DVCS not that big of a deal for the way many people already use CVCS, when you end up working with a centralized copy anyway.",1268931634

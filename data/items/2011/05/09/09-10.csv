At most they could earn 50 BTC/10 minutes, no matter how much computing power they'd throw at it.<p>It get's more interesting if a company could calculate blocks faster than all the other nodes combined. Then that company could forge the complete chain of transactions.<p>I think there are even numbers floating around in the BitCoin forums as to how much it would cost to build such a server farm atm. So yeah - with enough money you could ruin BitCoin, but why would you be motivated to do so? Also, it gets harder every day, as the network of nodes grows.",1304935109

Governments around the world are banning phosphates from domestic detergents to prevent water eutrophication (algal blooms etc.). However, domestic applications account for no more than 2% of the problem, the remaining 98% come from human waste (crap) and agriculture (both phosphate fertilizer and animal waste).<p>It is therefore rather ""symbolic politics"" with politicians trying to get a ""greener image"" on this issue, rather than actually fixing the environment.<p>What's more, sewage treatment plants could also reclaim phosphate from wastewater and collect it to be recycled, this would close the cycle.<p>But this probably won't happen, right now governments are looking at banning STPP from automatic dishwasher detergents as well, and industrial and institutional cleaners are next. So you can expect a lot dirtier dishes soon as well.<p>For more information you can check out <a href=""http://www.ceep-phosphates.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ceep-phosphates.org/</a> which is the European lobby for phosphate producers.

Even if it became popular, governments would squash it because of #1 and because they like being in power.<p>It is not proven that goverments are able to destroy bitcoin even if they will.<p>> 3. A single mathematical or other error in the cryptosystem would cause instant, unresolvable, worldwide hyperinflation. After hundreds of years of analysis, there are no known flaws in the current financial system that could lead to that. (Other than the known causes of hyperinflation of course, ie. total gross mismanagement of the entire country.)<p>Currently the bitcoin system is working and no errors have emerged. Of course no one in the world can be 100% sure that the bitcoin system will be functioning always, but currently it's working pretty well. I'm willing to take the risk of mathematical/programmatical error, and I bet that so are many others.<p>> 4.

BTW, your name is Guillame Maury, and your birthday is 03/07/1982.<p>Anyway, I also live in China, and have had problems with banks being so secure that it becomes inconvenient. A few months ago I tried to get into my ING account, for which I'd lost the password. Although I managed to authenticate my identity over the phone, they could only send me a new password to my address in the UK. However, this is a house my family no longer lives in... so the whole affair involved contacting the new occupants to forward the new password letter on to someone I knew. I've also had problems with Natwest's online payment system giving me an ""unknown failure"" message. After calling up, I found that the system had flagged my transaction as suspicious due to my location as revealed by my IP address. When dealing with such issues, I often feel like I'm trying to steal my own identity.<p>Anyway, after looking at the options I decided to use PasswordCard to manage my passwords, which is a physical solution (www.passwordcard.org). It's a card of random numbers, symbols and letters that you can print out. You then take a sequence of such symbols to form each new password that you need. I decided not to use a standard password manager since it's not very portable between machines (I travel quite a bit, and also with the current rate of technology change it's likely that in a few years I'll be using a device and OS that doesn't exist yet).",1304931709

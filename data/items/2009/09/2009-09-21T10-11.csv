I am also certain that even though I tried hard to find out prior to the purchase, it was not possible to see the breakdown in shipping costs.  Only seeing one shipping cost line item is one reason some might believe its all being bundled together from a big amazon warehouse somewhere.  Especially with widespread business articles like the OP educating the world that's what Amazon has become.  Otherwise, why not show me 4 different shipping charges, maybe I want to send one priority and the others not.<p>I also filled out feedback on these purchases after I received the shipments to state what my complaints were about the shopping experience, but never heard back from anyone.  This part of course, doesn't surprise me.  Simply pointing out that if I were to do something like this again, I may as well buy direct from the real supplier so that if I did have a problem, I wouldn't be complaining through a middleman.",1253529996

Unless we're all have been abducted by aliens and brainwashed to use it there must be some value otherwise the billion wouldn't be there to back it up.<p>People who want to convince us that Twitter has no value wanted to tell us the same thing about Facebook a year ago. Now they earn money already, one year earlier than planned.<p>To me this sounds like envy. Everybody believing that s/he has the best startup idea out there but instead something ""value-less"" like Twitter is worth a billion.

834318,comment,834100,834100,0,0,jhancock,,,"This little tidbit about Buffet is hard to confirm, as Jason admits in his post.  However, I can confirm something like this is common behavior in China.<p>I first experienced it when going to China in 2000 to meet with banks.  My job was to convince them to let us modernize their software and provide Internet banking.  We would have a meeting setup and present to a room of top officials.  These meetings could never be confirmed until the day before.  Keep in mind I had to first fly from NY to Vancouver to Hong Kong to get to Beijing with no schedule of meetings, just several that were in constant ""maybe"" status and no clear dates.<p>A typical meeting (once I cleared the previous evening's dinner meeting, also unscheduled, to be sniffed out) would be a vice-chairman, the head of IT, a few others.  Then we'd go to a big lunch.  If they liked what they saw, word got to the Chairman and he would join us at lunch, we'd get to know each other a bit and then if that suited him, have a meeting with him after lunch.  After quite a bit of this, it became clear this was a pattern.  In years to come, I learned to accept that all meetings were in flux and decided the day or only hours before.  It turns out to be very effective for them in several ways.  The multilayered approach allows for quick vetting before access to the decision maker.  And the short scheduling approach allows them to constantly reshuffle the deck.<p>But, of course, as with Buffet (if indeed its true), in China, this behavior is exhibited most by those with the power to do so.  The rest of society plans several days or weeks in advance.",1253529247

834315,comment,834267,834267,0,0,kwamenum86,,,"This is a problem for sure.  There is so much in this story I could comment on but I will just say that children definitely get an idea of what they are ""supposed"" to be from several different sources- parents, television, teachers, peers, etc.  When you are young there is a sort of penalty for being different or unusual and children often end up gravitating toward some role at least some of the time.  I think certain ethnic groups ""over-achieve"" and others ""under-achieve"" because of this pressure- they are just being who they are ""supposed"" to be.  This is my verbose way of blaming the whole thing on peer and societal pressures.<p>People (adults and children alike) are not really equipped to resist societal pressure.  We have a lot of things we are supposed to do- graduate high school/college, get married (maybe even to someone of our own race), have children, get a good job, shower everyday, wear ""cool clothes"", get good/bad grades, act black, act white and we often suffer societal consequences if we don't ""behave""...  I think the HN community, being more counter-culturalist/entrepreneurial than average can definitely see where I am coming from on this.",1253529091

Fuses? I've not seen a fuse on a main power circuit in 20 years. Furthermore, a figure around how many computers you can get per empty 20a circuit (~6, less if it's hot outside) might be useful for American readers.<p>Another is wireless security: Just change the key, or remove it if you're in an unpopulated area. MAC filtering is less secure than telling people to keep the key secret.<p>And why are they talking about the kid who threw the mega-party? Why would you invite people who you don't know to a residential LAN party? People aren't going to show up with a computer and crash a LAN party, that's just not how it works.<p>In summation: the information about how to throw a party that is 'good' applies to any sort of get-together, the information that's LAN party specific is lacking anything above common sense.",1254412469

I'm graduating soon, moving to San Fransisco, and would like to start a career in programming. I'm a bit lost as to how to get off to a good start in the industry. So I was hoping I could get a bit of advice from you guys.<p>My Background<p>I'm 25, and will be graduating with a BS in Applied Math. My language of choice is C, although I'm just as proficient with C++ and Python. At the moment, I'm living in Colorado, but plan to move to San Francisco at the end of this semester upon graduation. From what I've heard and seen, the stretch of land between San Francisco and San Jose is the mecca of technology. I'm super excited.<p>The problem is that I don't really know where to start. When I look at most of the job ads on DICE, I see requests for very specific skills. While I have some experience in these areas (say, posix threads), I'm an expert in none. I started programming over 10 years ago, but I don't have any solid completed projects to show for it.<p>Is it possible for a guy like me to get hired without any previous working experience in the industry? I have a very strong math background, and am well versed in Algorithms and proper software design. But like I said, I don't really have anything to show for it.<p>My main concern is making sure that I work somewhere interesting. I want to tackle interesting problems that actually mean something. I don't want to be a digital plumber that fixes bugs in an enterprise CRM system. Obviously though, I'll take what I can get just starting out.<p>What advice would you guys have for someone just starting out in the software development world?<p>Thanks for the help.",1254412271

855134,comment,854916,854916,0,0,jhancock,,,"Here's a few things I experienced when building an erlang webapp 4 years ago:<p>During dev, I had a server live for users to play with.  The data structures were in flux, there was zero traditional data input protection.  My users were domain experts, no tech background and would type in all sorts of odd inputs as there was no training or documentation on how to use the webapp.  But I never once had data corruption issues and never once did the server crash. I was able to run this ""test"" server with no admin or headaches while I was doing dev.<p>The reasons are due to a few characteristics of erlang:<p>1 - you write concrete pattern matching, not abstract object containers. So a controller or model function would spec out a clear data structure that was expected as input.  Anything else failed right at the point where the data didn't fit the patterns and guards.<p>2 - each request is handled by an isolated erlang process that fails gracefully and doesn't effect the rest of the system.  So my early testers would get error dumps from the server for bad data inputs but they never corrupted the data or crashed things.  I was able to take these error messages from test users to see how they were using the system incorrectly.<p>3 - Single assignment and functional programming were a big win in terms of writing once, testing once (not writing separate test code), and knowing that that piece of code was solid and I could move on.<p>The app was very responsive.  All requests were ajax and this system felt like the server was running on the same box as the web browser.  When we had errors, the erlang error message almost always showed the crash at exactly the point in the code that needed attention.<p>These characteristics speak to the power of the dev process, not scalability which is what you normally hear about erlang.",1254411742

But if you want to keep the Latin analogy going, you have to acknowledge that Latin stuck around because an entrenched organization continued to use it long after it had lost <i>vulgar</i> relevance. And Latin's high status fooled the intellectuals of the day into thinking that it was the pure, holy tongue, and had undue and sometimes destructive influences on the development of other languages. This happened precisely because people tried to apply the grammatical <i>patterns</i> of Latin to languages that were structurally different.<p>I'm not saying that Java (or Latin, for that matter) doesn't have a place in the future, but I just hope that it doesn't continue to have undue influence on the evolution of programming language and methodologies simply because it is a revered institution.",1254411582

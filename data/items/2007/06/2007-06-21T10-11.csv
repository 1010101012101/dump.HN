I'm sure you've seen them yet prefer to leave the page sparse.<p>Is it intended as some kind of intelligence test on your users?  In the same way as not explaining the <i>markup</i> system anywhere?  If so, I think it's a silly test, and one your users are happy to fail.<p>If you haven't got the time to concoct some text, here's a suggestion:<p>Submit a URL with a well-thought through title to explain its relevance to your audience.  Leaving the URL empty will submit a question for discussion.  Please ensure submissions are relevant to Startup News;  if you want Slashdot, Digg, or Reddit, you know where to find them.  There's a thread for Feature Requests, so please add a post to that and refrain from starting anymore ""Vote up for ..."" threads.  There's a bookmarklet to ease submitting, but it doesn't mean these guidelines don't apply.

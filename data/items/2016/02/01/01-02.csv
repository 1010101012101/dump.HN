11009178,comment,11008449,11008799,0,0,derefr,,,"From my perspective, containers just make explicit what&#x27;s always been true: the library dependencies linked into the &quot;release&quot; of an &quot;app&quot; <i>need</i> to be stewarded by the app developers, rather than the OS distributor. System components are owned by the system maintainer, but apps are owned by their developers, and the SLAs are separate.<p>If Nginx, for example, has a security flaw, it&#x27;s properly <i>Nginx&#x27;s</i> job to make a new container. That flaw might be because of Nginx&#x27;s dependency on OpenSSL, but it might also be because of a vulnerability in Nginx itself. Nginx (and every other &quot;app&quot; developer) needs the process in place to get new releases out in the latter case; if they have that process, there&#x27;s no reason to not apply it also to the former case.<p>Distro maintainers have been picking up the slack of creating &quot;security releases&quot; for app software for decades now, but they only do it because app developers were <i>unwilling</i> to take on the responsibility of maintaining packages in several different package ecosystems. App developers are not nearly as timid when it comes to container-image releases, since it&#x27;s just the one QA process rather than five. So, properly, the responsibility—and the SLA—is reverting back to the app developer.<p>You can&#x27;t expect, now, that paying Redhat or Canonical for a support contract will mean that Redhat/Canonical will be required to rush you patches for your app software. It never worked this way anywhere else; Microsoft and Apple aren&#x27;t responsible for patching the vulnerabilities in the apps in their ecosystems. (Even the ones you buy through their stores!) The Linux world is just coming back to parity with that.<p>Now, on the other hand, <i>system components</i>—things the OS itself depends on—still need to be patched by the OS manufacturer. Microsoft still delivers IE patches; Apple still delivers Webkit patches. Because those are fundamentally system components, used by the OS to do things like drawing notification dialogs.<p>Those components happen to come with apps, but the system component and the app are decoupled; there&#x27;s no reason the version of Webkit the OS uses, and the version of Webkit Safari uses, need to be the same. And they&#x27;re not: you can download a fresh Webkit from Webkit.org and Safari will pick it up and use it. Apple, thus, only takes SLA-responsibility for the <i>system-component</i> Webkit—not the &quot;app Webkit.&quot; The same is (soon to be) true for Linux distro-makers.<p>---<p>The near-term effect of all this, of course, isn&#x27;t that app developers universally pick up the maintenance-contract stone and start carrying it. Most have spent too long in the idyllic world of &quot;downstream support&quot; to realize, right away, what this shift spells for them. Instead, in the near term, it&#x27;ll be <i>your</i> responsibility, as a system administrator, to be a release-manager for these container-images. This was always true to some degree, because every stack tends to depend on some non-OS-provided components like Nginx-current or the non-system Ruby. But now it&#x27;ll be pretty much everything.<p>An interesting incentive this creates is to move your release-management more toward monolithic synchronized releases. If you&#x27;re managing the releases of all the components in your stack, it&#x27;s much easier to think of yourself as releasing a whole &quot;system&quot; of co-verified components, rather than independently versioning each one. When you upgrade one component, you bump the version of the system as a whole. This sort of release-management is likely familiar to anyone who has managed an Erlang system. :)",1454291987

Economic &quot;attacks&quot; are often seen as attacks by nation states, not by individuals, and as such, directly reflect foreign policy attitudes. Language like this only adds fuel to the fire. Given the different worldview about how the world works, motivations will always be suspect. Official party mouthpieces will never view such actions as a secular step to simply make money, and many especially uneducated people (who still make up a huge portion of the country) would agree with the mouthpieces on how to understand it. I&#x27;m not saying that we should coddle nation states. I am saying that it&#x27;s unfortunate that I think an economic exercise would result in strained foreign relations at all levels.

Everyone is on board with the presumed necessary large scale destruction of Europe because of the holocaust. It was the internal horrific politics of the Nazis on people they considered foreigners which justify this.</i><p>This is just not true.  The plight of the Jews was not a major factor in the United States entering the war, or in the war at all for that matter. The US entered in response to a direct attack, though we could say that that was just the tipping point that escalated America&#x27;s involvement to outright war. The underlying factors were the defense of allied democracies, and particularly the fear of a hostile international order where America would stand alone against the massive totalitarian regimes in Germany, Russia, and Japan, who likely would have controlled the rest of the world (and thus people and resources, and thus industrial capacity, and thus military might) between them.  As for how we look back at it, Lincoln&#x27;s formulation for the Civil War could apply just as well:<p><i>[...]that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.</i>",1454291454

If you take any blog article, it consists of this same layout, only instead of a link to the article, you have a bunch of text and/or pictures.<p>It arguably took <i>more</i> work to design a product (the web browser) that can parse html, apply CSS styling, parse and execute Javascript, and tie all those pieces together with the DOM than it would have been to just have webservers pass a loosely annotated version of the page contents to the browser and let the browser decide how to render and interact with the content on its own accord.<p>The point is, running an &quot;app&quot; on the web is largely BS. If you think your blog, news site, or forum is sufficiently different from the thousands of others out there that it warrants an entirely new <i>application</i> (as opposed to just different styling), then you&#x27;re full of yourself.<p>And if we had taken that simpler route, I wouldn&#x27;t have to spend <i>days</i> designing a trivial blog site. Websites wouldn&#x27;t all be so jarringly different (which they largely are, and unnecessarily so). I could get straight to writing my content, because browser defaults would actually be sane enough to do the dirty work for me. And the resulting UI would be more accomodating to the user than anything I could whip up with &quot;modern&quot; web technologies because the browser has access to the user&#x27;s [language, color, contrast, font-size] preferences. Not to mention how much more accessible it would be to the visually (or otherwise) impaired.",1454291160

It&#x27;s very much a desired quality of a democracy, that politicians pursuing their own self-interests will be driven to pursue the interests of the people. Unfortunately, it can also work when the enemies are imagined or exaggerated.  Again, we can only look to the particular circumstances for the answer.  I take strong issue with your particular implication that the Cold War threat from the Soviet Union was in any sense overstated.  If anything, McCarthy was more right about Soviet infiltration than he was ever given credit for until recently.  That doesn&#x27;t justify blacklists and the horrifying HUAC sessions; those are the self-defeating measures I was talking about.<p>><i>So I show the political leaders saying that they want to kill us and I get more power. I show all the repressive state tactics of the Americans on their own people, I get more power. &quot;Look&quot;, I say &quot;Even at their sports games, the evil Americans treat their own citizens like they are in a prison!&quot;</i><p>There&#x27;s a lot of clever propaganda against the US, but I can&#x27;t imagine this being a big winner.  And anyway, the ability of demagogues to twist our actions for their propaganda purposes cannot be an overriding consideration. The US is very rich and very powerful, so people will hate us no matter what we do.  And if they can&#x27;t find any facts to base it on, they&#x27;ll just make some up.

Then while I&#x27;m sleeping, they check out my work and provide any feedback on that, and on next tasks, which is then ready for me first thing in the morning, and so the process repeats.<p>You do have the worry about finding clients, but if you are reliable and do good work then you can start to build up a regular client base.<p>You&#x27;ll also want to have a good Internet connection for video calls and screen sharing.

But I would like to share some information about this aspect of security.<p>Full packet captures of network traffic are extremely, extremely valuable in post-compromise incident investigation and in incident detection, as they allow for vastly more complex analysis of traffic (done post-hoc with more complicated logic) than is practical on the wire. There&#x27;s absolutely no need to invoke the NSA here: multiple private vendors offer these systems. It sounds like UC went with Fidelis, another major provider is RSA NetWitness (now part of EMC). These systems are fairly common on corporate networks, the main thing that limits their installation is cost: just the storage becomes rather costly at large scales.<p>Invoking attorney-client privilege on matters related to security is pretty common in the private world. The reason for this is that any security investigations and reports are subject to legal discovery and may be used to establish liability in the event that someone sues you for a matter related to a cybersecurity incident. The primary way to protect this information is to place the cybersecurity function under legal counsel so that all security work is work-product of an attorney and so under privilege. This is a recommended best practice in the security compliance community. Public institutions do this less frequently for the reason that it is often prevented or superseded by the relevant public record/accountability law, or unnecessary due to some type of immunity for example, but this may not be the case in California.<p>All in all, nothing here strikes me as particularly unusual practice for a large organization. What I do see is that UC has made several massive mistakes in implementation:<p>1. It must be completely clear to users that they have no expectation of privacy when using organizational networks. Unfortunately, many users do not realize this, and many organizations do not sufficiently communicate it. All users of organizational networks should sign an agreement to ensure that they are aware that they have no expectation of privacy. This is already legally true in as far as I know all cases, but there is an ethical obligation, I think, to ensure further than that.<p>2. Universities present a particularly tricky situation because there is a captive audience of users who rely on the university network for their personal usage. Ideally this should be 100% segregated from the institutional network, I believe, but I have work experience in a small university&#x27;s IT and I can tell you how difficult this is to manage - and I can imagine that the problems at the scale of even a single UC campus are so much greater. They can and definitely should work harder to balance network management against the privacy of their captive users.<p>3. It appears that there are inadequate controls in place (or at least disclosed) to protect this data. I am very uncomfortable with the involvement of a third-party without thorough documentation of their controls in place and their liability in the event of misuse. There must also be further internal controls - both technical and administrative - to guard against misuses. Simply asserting that the data is only used for security is not sufficient, set actual controls to ensure this and establish how violations will be handled.<p>4. Creating fragmentation within the IT org is very common in universities but still a terrible idea. All levels of IT and security operations should be 100% on board with security mechanisms used, which appears to not be the case here.<p>A couple of auxiliary thoughts:<p>- If they are intercepting SSL (which may be a good idea for a corporate network, there are several factors to weigh against each other) this will of course be limited to computers that they manage.<p>- Tivoli BigFix, as mentioned elsewhere, is a common and rather good endpoint security solution. A similar competitor is Cisco NAC. These aren&#x27;t scary NSA codewords, they&#x27;re commercial products that many corporations use to ensure that all computers on a protected network meet a minimum security configuration. Whether or not they are appropriate in the ways that some universities use them is a very touchy issue, I don&#x27;t think that they are, but that means that potentially much more costly (and inconvenient) controls will need to be in place.<p>- Universities need to carefully manage the fact that they are often not perceived as corporate orgs in terms of their network practices, although they usually behave like them. There are certainly complications at universities. Open communication of policies and procedures will help to alleviate this, as well as good network management (once again, complete isolation of residential and administrative networks should be the goal).",1454289474

Don&#x27;t believe the hype; we are merely standing on the first step of a very tall ladder.</i><p><i>Some say that the hierarchical-modular decomposition of visual space learned by a convnet is analogous to what the human visual cortex does. It may or may not be true, but there is no strong evidence to believe so. Of course, one would expect the visual cortex to learn something similar, to the extent that this constitutes a &quot;natural&quot; decomposition of our visual world (in much the same way that the Fourier decomposition would be a &quot;natural&quot; decomposition of a periodic audio signal). But the exact nature of the filters and hierarchy, and the process through which they are learned, has most likely little in common with our puny convnets. The visual cortex is not convolutional to begin with, and while it is structured in layers, the layers are themselves structured into cortical columns whose exact purpose is still not well understood --a feature not found in our artificial networks (although Geoff Hinton is working on it). Besides, there is so much more to visual perception than the classification of static pictures --human perception is fundamentally sequential and active, not static and passive, and is tightly intricated with motor control (e.g. eye saccades).</i><p><i>Think about this next time your hear some VC or big-name CEO appear in the news to warn you against the existential threat posed by our recent advances in deep learning. Today we have better tools to map complex information spaces than we ever did before, which is awesome, but at the end of the day they are tools, not creatures, and none of what they do could reasonably qualify as &quot;thinking&quot;. Drawing a smiley face on a rock doesn&#x27;t make it &quot;happy&quot;, even if your primate neocortex tells you so.</i><p><i>That said, visualizing what convnets learn is quite fascinating --who would have guessed that simple gradient descent with a reasonable loss function over a sufficiently large dataset would be enough to learn this beautiful hierarchical-modular network of patterns that manages to explain a complex visual space surprisingly well. Deep learning may not be intelligence is any real sense, but it&#x27;s still working considerably better than anybody could have anticipated just a few years ago. Now, if only we understood why... ;-)&quot;</i>",1454288802

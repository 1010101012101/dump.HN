""The 'under 10k' price tag is misleading because it does not include the opportunity cost of the web designers time. In other words, one has to calculate (the hours spent by Metalab web designers * their normal hourly rate) and add this to 10k to arrive at a more accurate cost for building this site.""<p>Yes, we really did build it for less than $10k. Our key expenses were: Rails development (1 developer a few hours a week), a SliceHost server, and some custom icons we hired out. We're planning to break it down in more detail on our blog in the next little while, but I'd like to debunk this a bit here. You're absolutely right about the cost being higher if you consider what it would normally cost at a full consulting rate, but I feel like that's kind of fallacious logic:<p>If you learnt how to woodwork, built a bookshelf, then told your friends that it cost you $15 (the price of the wood and a couple of screws), they aren't going to argue that the true cost was $500 (the hours spent learning woodworking or a carpenter's rate).<p>If a founder who was an incredible programmer paid himself $1,000/month during the early months of his startup, would you say that his time really cost the company $15,000 (what he would have charged at a consulting rate)?<p>The point isn't that someone with no technical skills can do this for 10k (after all, this is Hacker News, and I assume most of you are highly skilled in the field), we're just pointing out that we managed to create a business by pulling a few extra hours a week over 6 months. We didn't have to quit our day jobs, move to the valley, or build a board of advisors - we just went ahead and built it. This isn't to say that it's an especially complex app or that it is some sort of technical feat, just that a little bit of money went a long way.<p>I don't think taking funding is always bad or anything, especially small seed funding like YC. Sometimes advantageous ideas need money to make them happen. The point is that most of you already have many of the skills required to build things, so funding really shouldn't be a barrier to entry. If your idea requires more money than you have, boil it down to the bare minimum and build it within your budget. We could easily have decided that we wanted to build the best invoicing app ever, figured out that invoicing was a 1.3 kagillion dollar industry, secured some funding, built up the stakes, then gone crazy with features. We could have convinced ourselves that we needed to close down our consulting business, hire a full-time Rails developer, and move in together. Instead we took a simple idea that we felt wasn't being done right, boiled it down to its core, then built it when we had the time.",1239439566
557368,comment,557245,557245,0,0,quizbiz,,,"I noticed the other day that I am using Google significantly less than I used to. I fulfill my internet needs by either searching direct on wikipedia or finding things on social networking sites, social bookmarking sites. My home page is now this Safari top sites page which I love and helps me avoid Google even further. And when I can't remember a domain, I use a QuickSilver trigger function which lets me search and open up the ""I'm feeling lucky"" or the number one result on google automatically.<p>I don't mean to suggest I don't search or that we are moving beyond search but trends in which we are navigating and interacting on the internet are changing.",1239439478

Tried a free account for now, and I like the overall feel.<p>One thing I'd love to see: Implement autosave of invoice drafts, or at least a JavaScript popup whenever I try to navigate away from an unsaved form.",1239439099
557365,comment,557226,557226,0,0,joe_the_user,,,"Wow,<p>It makes me think of someone who once said ""I used to feel sorry for myself because I had no shoes, until I saw a man who had no feet"" but in an opposite kind of way.<p>Actually working half-time at an average programmers' salary sounds great - assuming my current gig goes through. But it also sounds <i>so</i> much better than what these boobs were doing, during the ""good times"". Awesome.",1239439033
557364,comment,557333,557333,0,0,demallien,,,"It's just a one time pad with a novel key distribution system, where instead of directly sharing the key, you share the information necessary to extract the key from a random stream.  In addition to not introucing any new security advantages, it brings in a potential weakness - what if the source of random numbers isn't as random as the designer thinks?  Someone could potentially retrieve the key without having access to the key extraction information...",1239439012
557363,comment,557035,557152,0,0,zupatol,,,"Good quote. There is something suspicious about the whole idea, it sounds too much like an economist trying to solve every problem with the same hammer.<p>But Gary Becker is not a loon. He has a Nobel prize in economics. Before dismissing his ideas it's worth having a very close look at them.",1239438899

(Patrick may be using Markov chaining - I see a RandomChoice from CharFreqs.)<p>Basically, analyze a word corpus and create frequencies for letter pairs, considering word start and end as letters for convenience. Then, starting with a word start, choose letters randomly based on the frequency of the pairs where the first letter in the pair is the last letter in your current word. Continue until a word end is chosen.<p>Building frequencies using letter triplets rather than letter pairs can get better results, where pairs may choose unlikely match-ups such as ""cth"", taking e.g. a""ct"" as common, and ""th""e as common. Longer tuples can be chosen but a slight adjustment of word start and end strategy is needed.",1239437760

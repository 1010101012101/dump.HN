Sometimes you need visual elements which doesn't correspond to any semantic HTML element. I think SVG would be a good approach for designing these ""unsemantic"" visual elements, and you can use CSS with SVG. SVG would also be a good way to extend CSS beyound the built-in properties, eg. if I want to design a wawy border to apply to some elements.<p>He also has a good point about the need for calculation in CSS. However I am really worried about the possible manitenance nightmare of a turing-complete CSS! It should be designed very carefully. A constraint-based sublanguage for CSS would perhaps make sense.",1229173165

396676,comment,395436,395709,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"Since Objective-J <i>is</i> JavaScript (plus a few features) then by learning one you'll learn a good portion of the other.<p>All JavaScript code is valid in Objective-J, but typically you won't use the prototypal inheritance stuff, since Objective-J adds classical inheritance (which is entirely what Cappuccino uses). Likewise, a large portion of the Objective-J language is just JavaScript (all of the operators, variables semantics, built in types and functions, etc).<p>The major additions are code importing (@import <FrameworkName/FileName.j> or @import ""relativePath/FileName.j""), class definitions (the ""@implemention"" keyword and method declarations like ""-(ReturnType)methodName:(ArgumentType)argument""), and method calls/message sending (""[myObject methodName:argument]"")<p>My suggestion for learning Objective-J would be to pick up Crockford's book, ""JavaScript: The Good Parts"", and skip the parts about inheritance (unless you also want to learn that). It's a short book anyway. The nice thing about this particular book for learning Objective-J is it only covers the language, not the browser's APIs like the DOM, which you should never really need to know when using Cappuccino. (though I would recommend ""JavaScript: The Definitive Guide"", aka ""The Rhino Book"", as well to anyone doing JavaScript in browsers)<p>Once you have a feel for the core of the JavaScript language then it's just a few more syntax additions for the main features of Objective-J I listed above.",1229172680

396674,comment,325010,325579,0,0,blackswan001,,,"I am sure you did not understand Taleb at all. Actually I think it is possibly his mistake that he believes common people without n iota of statistics or mathematics can understand it. Let me explain, almost all of the equations that the Bankers used are based on a bell curve for a distributed event funtion. Now its called a bell curve because the be represents the average and assumes that an event of infini value would have zero chance to happen. That is ok general continuous function because that is a theorical contruct; but in a distributed function and which by definition cannot have zero occurance (because it is distributed) and event with infinite value can occur atleast once. The whole base of mathematics, therefore which is being used by the Banks is flawed and should be removed.If you udnerstand this thing, I would say Taleb is to Banking what Einstein was to Physics. He is asking you to change the foundation. Do you understand it? I doubt you do.",1229172560

In fact many students turn to Sudbury Valley after struggling with public schools or even being expelled from public schools.<p>Unlike most private schools Sudbury Valley will accept all students as long as they want to be there and agree with the educational philosophy (e.g. adults will not force your student to do anything)...",1387929543

If Cloudflare were to stop providing their services, the website might be inundated with traffic, or more susceptible to DDoS attacks, etc., but even if they terminated their relationship, this would not prevent rescator.la from doing their damage. The Pirate Bay is an excellent example of how little power one actually wields simply by controlling the DNS level.<p>Second, I&#x27;m a little concerned by the idea of a third party independently deciding that their client is guilty of a crime and unilaterally terminating that relationship.

What if someone had compromised rescator.la&#x27;s servers and happened to be carrying out a false flag operation[0]?<p>I use Cloudflare for a site I operate, and I would feel more than a bit uneasy if they terminated their relationship with a client in this manner.

6961618,comment,6961263,6961444,10,0,com2kid,,,"> Ultimately, what people need to realize is that autodidacticism is the most efficient form of learning.<p>I call bull.<p>I can learn from a math teacher in an hour what would take me possibly <i>years</i>, or a lifetime for that matter, to discover on my own.<p>During 2 years of college lecture classes one can learn what took philosophers and eventually mathematicians nearly 2000 years to discover.<p>But what about the arts?<p>Again, same story. Thousands of years of progress and theory can be summed up and taught in just months. (A wee bit of practice may then be required to master certain skills! ;) )<p>Yes some self directed learning is valuable, and indeed almost <i>every class I took</i> had aspect of self guided learning in it. Teachers loved leading us halfway to the goal, pointing us in a general direction, and then letting us go forth and discover the answer for ourselves.<p>Now do I think how public schools are currently ran is ideal? Heck no, far from it. No Child Left Behind was a huge damaging blow to the American educational system.<p>But what I always wanted out of school was <i>more</i> direction, not less. I passionately hated assignments where students had to go off and make their own video presentations and other such activities.<p>Yet in theory, giving presentations is of some value, it requires the students to acquire information on their own, summarize it into a communicable form, and then share that information with others. (I just despised how much class time was devoted to watching very bad presentations...)<p>But hey, that sounds like self guided learning, at a public school no less!<p>One thing to remember is that trying to dictate any one educational style is going to fail some non-trivial percent of students.<p>As I said in another comment, I did <i>horrible</i> in unstructured classes. More structure would have been my desire. IMHO school would have benefited from having 2 hours set aside just for an open study room for students to do HW in. But that is mostly because as a kid, left to my own devices, I would go home and play games rather than study. Heck I&#x27;d read a month&#x27;s worth of reading assignments on the bus home, then never do the book reports!<p>Likewise for finding study groups. As someone with social anxiety (which was much worse as a kid!) asking the class to form groups would result in me hiding in a corner somewhere. Suffice to say I never was good at getting language practice in either!<p>But lab classes, oh wow I rocked at those. Love&#x27;d them. On a related note, questions come up as to the suitability of unstructured learning for certain topics. E.g. How would unstructured learning have students do genetic modifications of bacteria? Or play with explosives? Both are some of my fondest memories from high school! Both involved very explicit step by step instructions written down that we followed to the letter! (For good reason!)<p>I guess my overall point is that ideologues of any type tend to have a drum and enjoy beating it, much to the determent of someone somewhere else.",1387929215

Actually they do all the important stuff: cooking, cleaning the streets, driving the cabs, delivering packages, extracting oil, mining coal, replacing the hospital bedsheets, growing and picking our food, taking care of the dead, and tons more besides, while the rest of the population gets to play &quot;highly specialized professional&quot; for doing high level BS from marketing to accounting.<p>><i>Another question: Would you replace your doctor, who earns 50x minimum wage, with 50 random minimum wage earners to do a medical procedure on you?</i><p>No, I&#x27;d replace him with a doctor that earns 1x mininum wage -- so everybody can afford him.

The same way that schools benefit students. But neither is true. Unions are exclusionary of entry level workers, they benefit people who already have good jobs and training often to the detriment of workers who don&#x27;t. And laws which force employers to provide benefits to &quot;full time workers&quot; generally just encourage businesses to keep some workers part time, forcing those people to work multiple jobs to earn more money.<p>Similarly, an excess of business regulation tends to force small companies out of business and promotes the creation of large corporations (due to economies of scale with respect to regulatory compliance). These effects are probably not intended but that&#x27;s rather irrelevant when they are still happening.<p>I bring these up because they are more controversial than the idea that institutionalized public schooling in the &quot;prussian&quot; model is harmful. It&#x27;s difficult to overcome ingrained biases and prejudices. If you find it troublesome to consider the idea that unions aren&#x27;t an unalloyed good then you shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that a lot of people have a hard time reconsidering the value of the current educational system.",1387928256

This is a perfectly valid approach to managing type 2 diabetes.<p>My mother is a type 2 diabetic and has been on a diet in which she consumes less than 30 grams of carbohydrates every day. To put that in perspective, the recommended daily consumption of carbohydrates is about 300 grams.  The vast majority of American adults consume more (sometimes much more).<p>She cannot eat bread, pasta, fruit, potatoes, or even carrots, among other things.  Surprisingly, some forms of sugar substitutes can also raise blood glucose levels.  But she <i>can</i> eat many kinds of vegetables, meat, eggs, and dairy products.  Just no sugar, and no carbs.<p>The diet has been very successful.  She barely needs insulin anymore, and she&#x27;s at the lowest A1C level she&#x27;s ever had -- even lower than when she was taking lots of insulin.  As a bonus, she&#x27;s returned to a healthy weight.",1387927259

187194,comment,186735,186981,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"I don't think I disagree with you, I just don't think that is relevant to the corporate world. Corporations don't want their workers installing third party apps on their phones, that's jut more IT headache for them. They want a device that enables their employees to communicate effectively. Nothing does that like a Berry. And even if it did, the cost of switching would keep everyone using Berries.",1210557335
187193,comment,187163,187163,0,0,smanek,,,"I think the author seems to underestimate the importance of having a technically competent manager (he seems to work at ITA, so he probably never had to deal with that ;-)).<p>In my experience technical skills should are a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite for being a manager. How do you expect someone to lead salesmen, programmers, or widget makers if they don't understand what their workers do?<p>'Management Skills', imho, can't exist in a vacuum without technical skills to back them up (which also means that 'management skills' don't magically translate between industries). 'Management Skills' are a conglomeration of inter-personal, bureaucratic, and technical skills.<p>As a bit of an aside, this is one of the big problems I have with many MBAs. Good MBAs have already put in years to hone their technical skills and then go back to school to augment what they already know. The bad ones (a depressingly large proportion of the ones I've met) have <i>no</i> technical skills (or technical skills so far outside their current work area as to be useless). I've even met a couple of managers who did their MBA right after finishing their undergrad degree (wtf?).<p>I'm not suggesting that the manager should be the most technically skilled person on a team, but he should have sufficient technical chops to at least understand and evaluate what his employees are doing.<p>I personally think that any manager interview should include the type of managerial behavioral questions that the author proposes <i>in addition to</i> a standard interview that his workers face. A programmer's manager should also be asked questions about Big-O notation, pointers, etc.<p>If you wouldn't hire the guy as programmer (the tech du jour may change, but the fundamentals don't) why hire him as a manager?<p>And, as a personal note, congrats on working at ITA. I'm moving to Cambridge in a couple of weeks and hope to join you guys one day. It takes a special type of man to look at the traveling salesmen problem and say, ""You know what, this looks too simple. What can we do to make it more fun?"" ;-)",1210557300

But everybody has BESes and BlackBerries, and all of their employees are used to BlackBerries, so the momentum is enormous and nobody is switching. The costs for a Fortune 1000 company to do so are prohibitive, and the incentive minimal since the Berries work so well.<p>Also, BlackBerries still have keypads superior to all hardware alternatives. I've owned Treos and a Moto Q, and I picked up a newish Berry and could tell the difference immediately. That's far and away the most important feature to a frequent emailer.<p>It's entirely possible that an Android phone will match that, but lots of people have tried over the last decade and none have come anywhere close. But even if they do, they have to make inroads against the massive numbers of installed BESes. That's going to take a long time in the corporate world.",1210557207

The article was not suggesting or presenting anything particularly interesting, but seemed to have been modded up because of its potency. Perhaps this is also what happened to my comment!<p>On your topic, however, I agree that it would be sad to see a Slashdot-esque consistency to opinion on here, but I consider it an inevitability. When it takes over, yet another site will become our refuge :)",1210556849
187189,comment,187132,187132,0,0,edw519,,,"My solution?  I simply stopped worring about how much time I spent doing or not doing something.<p>I started focusing on one thing only: the delta between what I planned to have complete at the end of each day vs. what I actually completed that day.<p>On Thursday, my plan was to have items A, B, and C complete before I knocked off.  A & B were done by noon.  I overlooked 2 prerequisites for C and had to go back and do them, then do C, which took twice as long as I expected.  I didn't finish until 2 a.m.  I also spent x hours on line.  So what?<p>Sometimes going online gives me a break.  Sometimes it gets the juices flowing again.  And of course, sometimes it's just a waste of time.  But it doesn't matter.<p>What's better, spending 6 hours online and getting everything done or spending 2 hours online and not finishing?<p>We often forget that (time spent) != (work accomplished).<p>Stop worrying about how much time you spend planting seeds and focus more on finishing each day's harvest.",1210556623

For example, they use shitty LCDs because they have some pride issue buying components from Japan and Korea, and therefore get second-rate LCDs instead.  On my T61, there is a slot for an xD card (which my camera uses), but for some reason Lenovo has disabled that reader in hardware.  It shows up in Linux, but can't read the media.  What the <i>fuck</i>?<p>Anyway, the hardware is solid, but Lenovo is pulling a lot of crap that will probably prevent me from buying another Thinkpad.  Dell and Apple both suck for other reasons, unfortunately, making it impossible to get an acceptable laptop.  sigh.",1210555504

It was created because Zack and I deal with the same problem.<p>The default settings of 8aweek are definitely not strong enough for a major news junky.  Mostly because the settings that news junkies need would probably piss of most users :).  There are two modes to 8aweek, if you haven't tried already switch your settings to ""block mode"" and edit your preferences to limit the time and limit on the number of breaks in your day.<p>Currently we're only on FF and tend to focus more on our incentives and passive alerts than making the blocking more hardcore.  If you immediately need something a little stronger I wrote a blog post last summer on the method I used before I had 8aweek (editing your hosts file).<p><a href=""http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/combating-internet-addiction/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thingsilearned.wordpress.com/2007/05/04/combating-int...</a><p>Another tip is to read a GTD book and try to only spend time infront of your computer when you have a clearly defined task to code out or read up on.

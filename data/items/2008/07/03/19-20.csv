Unfortunately, detecting some bugs is either a lot of work or almost impossible -- you can't, for example, generate DOM events programatically, so bugs in event handling are very tricky to test for.<p>On the bright side, it is often possible to write your fix in a non-invasive way, or adjust your code to not depend on the buggy behaviour. (For example, some browsers will still fire a keypress event if you cancel the corresponding keydown event. My code editor[1] ended up checking again in the keypress handler for keys that should have been handled, and cancelling them again.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marijn.haverbeke.nl/codemirror</a>",1215114835

There are people that say you <i>never</i> need to know how the computer works.  Then the rest say that you <i>always</i> need to think about how the computer works.  The reality is somewhere in the middle.  There have been a few cases in my programming career where knowing how the hardware actually worked was helpful.  But it was never <i>critical</i>, just good to know.<p>(Another similar area is data structures.  Yes, it's good to know how merge sort and quick sort and B+ trees work.  That direct knowledge has helped me a number of times, either because I needed my own tree or because thinking about how merge sort worked helped me solve a related problem.  But the other 99% of the time, I'm not thinking about sorting or the tree balancing algorithm.  I just use libraries.  So <i>theoretically</i>, it's possible to write good programs without knowing that stuff.)",1215113872

I don't know how to directly help you except to say that you shouldn't worry about anything and stay as cool as possible and concentrate on what you are doing. I don't know if it helps, but it's the best thing i can think of, there is really no secret in speaking to people, its a skill like any other, and some learn it easy and some learn it hard. So just take your mind off of the worries and concentrate on your job. Maybe in my case is my ability not to care if i make a fool of my self. I know its hard for most people, but not caring what others think to some extend gives people great confidence it the way they act.

We use it for documentation, and not (much) structured data, but I have noted that it has far better support for structured data than any other wikis I've used.

So, you can build a form for entering structured data, and that structured data goes into the wiki (and can be edited on the same form or directly in wikitext).<p>It's quite intimidating from a customization perspective, but since it has so many features built in, you probably won't need to do a lot of coding to make it do what you want.

Good schools nearby, nice culture and decent weather so smart people like to live there, low friction living so those smart people can focus on their work rather than on getting by (this can mean a lot of things, but I think places where long commutes are the norm is probably a negative), enough of the support infrastructure necessary for running a tech business (tech-knowledgeable legal services, accountants, PR/marketing, etc.).<p>I'd think this narrows it down to a few areas in the US, roughly in order of goodness: Silicon Valley, Boston, Austin, Research Triangle in NC, Seattle (sucky weather, though), New York, Chicago, Houston (too spread out, so long commutes, and hot muggy weather), Pittsburgh, Dallas/Fort Worth, Portland (too cold!), Boulder, and probably a few others.<p>But, again, your biggest customers can determine your success or failure more than almost any other element, and being near them makes them more likely to work with you.

This doesn't mean they are stupid or apathetic to politics in general, but only that nothing is threatening their way of life right now.<p>People participate in politics for selfish reasons. I would say it's a good thing that college students aren't erupting into protests every day. That means they must be content and happy, right?",1215112382

It's Java minus modern features and with more rope to hang yourself with.  (Then again, someone actually told me that spending an entire day with Valgrind hunting down a memory leak was fun.)<p>If you want power, non-Java-ness, and modern features, learn a language like Lisp, Haskell, OCaml, etc.  And learn Perl for actually getting things done.",1215112066

I don't know assembly, but I do know how computers work (and I even know you have to trigger an interrupt to make a system call).  I think he should just get to the point and say ""people should learn how the computer works"", rather than suggesting that you learn a programming language that makes you aware of some aspects of how a computer works.<p><i>It's like a very sharp knife: you can cut yourself as well as whatever it is you're trying to slice.  It's really easy to write broken or inflexible code in it.</i><p>This is true of all powerful tools.  I've seen horribly unmaintainable Lisp and Haskell.  I've also seen very clean and maintainable Perl.  C is no different than any other programming language, although it does actively discourage good code.  You can ignore the discouragement, but why not use a language that encourages maintainability, or at least automatically deallocates memory when you're done using it?<p>Anyway, I don't think this article shows why the author likes C, or why someone else should learn C.  Sure, learn C if you want to learn C.  But you can also learn about your computer by just learning about your computer.",1215112039

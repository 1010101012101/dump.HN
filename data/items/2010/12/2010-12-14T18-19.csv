I mean, how high does that uniform work factor have to be?<p>The guy whose password is ""password"" or ""qwerty12"" is gonna get cracked no matter what, sure. But what about people whose passwords are a couple of dictionary words? If the work factor means each hash takes a second or two, even a slightly complex dictionary attack becomes fruitless (for most crackers...)<p>So the user can still log in, but it takes a second or two, and there's that little message, ""To ensure the safety of your password, your login has been slowed down. If you use a more secure password, like <generate password>, you will login much faster!""<p>And the young lady using ""6ab$TRa?"" isn't being punished for the fact that <i>most</i> users use crappy passwords, nor is your server.",1292353151

You need some per-user data, to defend against rainbow tables, and some per-site data, to protect weak passwords.<p>My fundamental objection to schemes like bcrypt/scrypt is that they impose a heavy performance penalty on authentication to avoid a relatively rare case; besides, any theoretical entity capable of reversing a typical salted-password implementation is also capable of reversing bcrypt/scrypt.",1292352366

2005107,comment,2004833,2004965,0,0,sph,,,"The problem is that it's relatively easy to brute-force attack even a salted hash today.<p>On the first day, people stored passwords in plain text.  If someone got access to your database, they had all the passwords.<p>On the second day, people decided to hash the passwords so that people couldn't unencrypt them.  Then the attackers created rainbow tables that correlated each hash with its associated password since the password would always hash to the same value (so you have ""109BCA"" in your database, but they have a table that has that hash and that ""12345"" hashes to that value).<p>On the third day, people decided to salt the hashes to render the rainbow tables ineffective.  Now, each password would hash to a different value so they couldn't just look up the password for a given hash.  However, as computing power increased it became easy to just brute-force the password.  You have the hash and you have the salt so you can just try every password with the hash until you get a match.<p><pre><code>  hashed_password = ""ACBDEF1234567890""
  salt = ""12345""
  possible_passwords = [""password1"", ""ilikesheep"", ""micro$oft""]
  possible_passwords.each do |pass|
    if Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(""#{pass}#{salt}"") == hashed_password
      real_password = pass
    end
  end
</code></pre>
The problem is that code like that has gotten really cheap to run and it's incredibly parallel (you can have loads of machines each take a piece of the workload - oh, and hopefully no one will make a joke that you'd never write that in Ruby; I just felt that would be easy pseudo-code to demonstrate).  You can just try combinations of passwords at random, but there are lists of more common passwords that you can try first making it go even faster.  Hashing algorithms are meant to be fast because they're meant to be usable on a large piece of data.  As such, it also becomes fast to brute force check all sorts of combinations.<p>On the fourth day, people started using things like bcrypt because bcrypt was made to be slow.  The fact that bcrypt is slow means that if someone wants to brute force it, it will be very slow going for them.  If one can check 10,000 SHA1 hashes in a second, but only 10 bcrypt hashes in a second, it will take 1,000x longer to crack the bcrypt stored password (those are just made-up numbers as an example).<p>Salting is better than not salting because they have to brute force the password.  However, as computing power increases it isn't so much better because brute forcing is becoming easy.  One needs to use a slow algorithm to make sure that cracking it will also be slow (prohibitively slow).  Bcrypt also allows you to specify how much work you want it to have to do.  This way, as computing power increases, you can increase the amount of computing power needed to compute the bcrypt.  By contrast, hashes are meant to go fast and so every day they're getting less secure.",1292350756

2005026,comment,2003515,2003515,0,0,blhack,,,"If you live in IA, MN, ND etc. (I'm sure other places, but these are the places I've lived), this story won't seem very out of the ordinary.<p>Once when I was in college, I flew to Arizona for Thanksgiving, then back to ND on a Monday to go to class.  When I got back, it was one of the worst snowstorms of the year.  It was horrible.  The school was closed, the roads <i>had</i> been closed that night, snow seemed to just be materializing out of nowhere; it was the type of storm you only experience when you live in the frozen, frozen north.<p>Well I hadn't slept more than about an hour on the plane, and driving down a 4 lane sheet of ice with no sleep in a two wheel drive little sporty coupe when the visibility is measured in numbers of feet that are less than 100 is a nearly suicidal idea, so I pulled off to the side of the road.<p>I pulled up the offramp, then back about 50 feet <i>down</i> on-ramp so that the trucks getting on the freeway wouldn't kill me.  I [very, very stupidly] left the car idling for the heater, set my phone for a 15 minute nap, and went to sleep.<p>Halfway through my nap, I hear <i>BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM</i> on the window, which did more to wake me up than the nap ever could have.  It was a girl, probably 17, who had seen me stopped on the side of the road, and wanted to make sure I was okay.  A high school aged girl that got out of her car in the freezing freezing cold during a horrible snowstorm to run up to some completely random car on the side of the freeway and make sure that the driver didn't need a ride.<p>I've lived in Phoenix for about 5 years now.  This sort of thing would never, ever happen here.  In fact, Phoenix has had the opportunity [on several occasions] to prove me wrong about this, and has failed every single time.  One summer, our family had a boat, and we were out having fun on Lake Pleasant.  At what was probably the worst possible time, which was when we were near 100s of other boats, the fuel pump gave up on us.  Not only did this mean that we were going to be floating towards the other boats (and the rocks, this lake is made of all rock), it meant that we didn't have any cell service (this area of the lake is in a cliff).  Our boat, obviously disabled, was floating towards the other boats.  Somebody is waving the orange flag we have around to let them know we're in trouble, my sisters and I are all in the water with ski ropes trying to pull the thing to safety and...nobody is helping.  People are looking at us like ""What the <i>hell</i> are you doing get out of OUR WAY!""<p>Disgusting.<p>We eventually got the motor running (limping, really) and made it out of the cove and into the main lake-almost-when the fuel pump died again.  This time, we were in a narrow passage between a couple of rock outcroppings.  Maybe 50-75 meters wide.  Again, orange flag us up, sisters and I are in the water trying to keep the boat from hitting the rocks and...people are flying past us in the cigarette boats giving us the finger because we're in their way.<p>Disgusting.<p>I like this, ""Today you...tomorrow me"".  A lot.   There was a time when some completely lost kids on their way to a music festival walked past my house as I was unloading some lumber from the jeep.  ""HEY!  Do you know where Kiwanis Park is!?""<p>""Yeah, about 4 miles south of here.""<p>""What, seriously?""<p>""Yeah, seriously, are you guys going to earth-dance?""<p>""Yeah.""<p>""Well come over here and help me unload the rest of this wood and I'll give you a ride.""<p>There was another time when somebody came up to me to ask if I knew the bus schedule...<p>""Why?  Where are you going?""<p>""Oh, well...North Phoenix."" (about a 40 minute drive from where we were)<p>""Huh, well I'll make you a deal.  If you promise to do something nice for somebody tomorrow, I'll give you a ride there.  Get in.""<p>The latest trend seems to be ""rejection therapy"".  If this helps people, good, but I <i>hate</i> this.  Can we instead please make the next trend ""Make somebody's day every day for 30 days therapy""?",1292349657

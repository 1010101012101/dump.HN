123884,comment,123403,123403,0,0,jkush,,,"Interesting. I'm a white guy and my wife isn't ""white"". We live in Maine, the whitest state in the union. When our daughter sees a picture of a non-white woman she always says that she ""looks a little like mama"".

Even though she's with her mother all the time, she clearly sees Caucasians as being the norm.",1204037834

John doesn't get paid if he doesn't sell since he's working on commission.  He sells at the risk of wasting his time (but not capital), makes bank and now he's fired.  Where is the injustice of him losing everything?  Did he have to give back his commission?  His risk was rewarded.  There's a definite hint of an agenda here.",1204035048

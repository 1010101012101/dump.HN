If you don't have customers you don't have a business.<p>So instead of wanting to be an entrepreneur, starting being more aware, find a problem that really get's you going, solve it, tell the world about it and charge them when they turn up.  Being passionate and making a difference is what's really important, not some label that you stick on yourself to impress people at cocktail parties.",1255254375
874580,comment,874296,874544,0,0,Maktab,,,"That's not really accurate. While it's true that the Bush admin focused on one term more than the other as a PR effort, they were not responsible for either creating or widely publicising the term.<p>'Climate change' has long been the more widely-accepted, scientific and neutral term for the study of variations in the earth's climate, man-made or not. Which is why the IPCC, launched in 1988, was named the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and not the Intergovernmental Panel on Global Warming. Similarly, the Kyoto Protocol is an additional segment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, first written in 1992. I doubt Bush had anything to do with the naming of either of those two.<p>IMHO, the term 'global warming' has done more harm than good. It's a sensationalist term popularised by the media which obscures the real issues at stake here. Because while the fact that the earth has warmed is in itself an issue, the core concern is really that man's activities have succeeded in having a measurable effect on the climate, an enormously complex system, and we have little idea what the consequences may be. It's the change itself that's dangerous, not just the fact that it results in warming in many parts of the world.",1255254111

People just tend to talk about sports and dating and parties and clubs and stuff.</i><p>It's not just you who has this problem. The experience you're relating probably sounds pretty familiar to many people around here. It's easy to forget that geeks are still the minority. In my experience so far, this won't change much as you get older. The ""Jockocracy"" is alive and well even after one finishes formal schooling, it just becomes a little less obvious and a little less homogeneous.<p>There may be some bastions of geekdom around the place and if you're lucky you'll have a few people that you can geek out with on a regular basis, but by and large it's lucky we have the Internet, hey.<p>Trust me kid (it feels weird that I can call an 18 year old ""kid"" now, but it feels right, I must be getting old), you will look back at your 18 year old self in 10 years with eyes you can't conceive of having today.<p>It's not about things really getting better or worse as you get older. It's more just about things getting different. It's not that youth is or should be this ""idyllic"" time and things just suck more as you get older. I think you'd find that many people who would self identify as geeks would not say their youth was particularly ""idyllic"".<p>You will be much wiser in 10 years. I know this is a cliché, but it's also true.<p>You will learn more from your failures than you will from your successes (I know, another cliché but again, very true), but make no mistake, the successes do feel better at the time. :)<p>You will have more responsibilities in 10 years. If there is one thing that has changed for me if I compare myself now to myself at 18, it is this. however much free time you have now, it will seem like a luxury looking back in 10 years. That's not to say that your life will necessarily turn into one big soul crushing grind or anything, but you will simply have more demands on your time. Some you will have desired and some you will not have. I now have a wife, I now have a budget to balance, bills to pay, a job to work at and so on. It's hard to say if I prefer my life now to the one I had when I was 18. Truthfully, I would say there are aspects of my life when I was 18 that I wish I still had and there are aspects of my life now that I would never give up to be 18 again.<p>Enjoy your youth and your current lack or responsibilities, try not to take it for granted (but you will, because we all do). Try not to take things too seriously. Some of the most interesting people I know still don't/didn't know what they wanted to do with their lives in their 30s. I might even include myself in this category actually. :P<p>Just keep at it, one foot in front of the other, you only really fail if you stop.",1255253569

874567,comment,874370,874454,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"Keep in mind that the x86-64/amd64 architecture also added a lot of other architectural improvements (like additional registers) and the processors supported running unmodified native x86 code much, much faster than the 32-bit only processors of the time. 5 years ago, if you wanted the absolute fastest x86 machine possible your best bet was to get a dual Opteron (amd64) system and just put a 32-bit OS on it. Running actual 64-bit apps also showed a significant speed improvement, regardless of ram usage.<p>This performance improvement, more so than the ability to address more than 4gb of memory, is the primary reason for 64-bit processing becoming mainstream, in my opinion.",1255253412

874562,comment,874399,874429,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Why do so many people talk about youth as some sort of idyllic time in one's life?<p>If you look into how memory works, negative details fade and positive memories remain. I keep pretty extensive journals, and it's absolutely staggering how much less pleasant my earlier life was than I remember it.<p>Also, most people accidentally wind up in a secure, relatively unchallenging position early in life, and never get out of that. Youth was their only time questioning authority, learning, and growing at a rapid rate. But the people I know that kept those attributes into their 20's... 30's... and 40's and beyond enjoy their later years as much or more than their earlier years.<p>If you're looking to run your own companies, projects, write your own papers, and do your own work, then you won't be nostalgically remembering your youth later. You're in line for a very challenging, but very stimulating and enjoyable life that gets better as time passes.<p>This may be a bit controversial, but I'd recommend you ignore the ""play around and enjoy it while you can"" crowd - most of the people I know that skipped that advice are quite successful and quite happy with that choice. Play around is good advice if you're looking for a very stable and secure life later. If you're in control of your own destiny, go ahead and build like crazy now - it'll have a compounding affect for the rest of your life, and will lead to a very fulfilling and prosperous life (and you're much likelier to end up quite wealthy, which has surprisingly become underrated as of late - consumerism sucks and you can't buy happiness, but wealth opens up so much freedom and opportunity. By starting now when you have no heavy expenses and aren't accustomed to a high standard of living, you put yourself in line to be very wealthy later)",1255252860

Secondly, what is the source for this news? At best the hint of a rumor. Thirdly, what industry need does 128-bit processors satisfy?<p>All around it points to a lack of critical thinking and skepticism, if not straight up naivete, gullibility, and ignorance bordering on incompetence on the part of the ""reporters"".<p>This line strikes me as amusing: ""Consequently, the company [MS] is also forming relationships with major partners, including Intel, AMD, HP, and IBM."" Newsflash: MS already has close relationships with each of those companies. There are many ""business partners"" from each of those companies who effectively work on the Microsoft campus.<p>At best this ""revelation"" is about the Itanium processor (which uses 128-bit instructions, though it retains a 64-bit word length and address space), in which case it is not only boring but horribly misleadingly recharacterized.",1255252737

Chances are if you like it, other people might like it, too.<p>A lot of the things you mention seem to be for other people's benefit, not for your own. Like writing papers - presumably the professors have more to gain. Or the science contests - sure, they'd look nice on your CV, but are you also intrinsically motivated to work on that stuff?

874555,comment,874399,874399,0,0,lionhearted,,,"You're thinking too externally:<p>...capital, capital, people, people, publishing, acceptance/denial... and so on.<p>To be successful, you can't wait to be blessed or funded or accepted by anyone else. A good place to start would be trying to get small jobs/contracts/articles/whatever that'll make you a bit of cash, a bit of success, and some lessons and contacts.<p>Also: Feel free to ignore the people telling you to soak in your youth. The Western world infantalizes people - keeps them younger than they need to be. Kids used to be officers in the army as early as 14, coming of age ceremonies at age 12, starting basic work at age 8. I was making pretty good money playing cards at age 18 and started my first successful company at 19.<p>Getting a huge head start on professional success now is quite likely to lead to a fun life with lots of cool people, experiences, and travel. Don't sweat missing opportunities to drink beer and socialize with young girls - it's overrated and you can do it in a much more high class and comfortable way after you make it later.<p>I'd recommend you start shooting for small wins that pay just a bit. Don't worry about your hourly rate, focus on your monthly rate. If it takes you 50 hours in one week to make $500, but you learn from it, that's good. Hell, 50 hours to make $200 in business could be worth it - it takes a long time to get started in business to the point where you make any money at a reasonable speed, but controlling your own destiny scales up much better. My first year in business I think I averaged like two dollars and change per hour - we're talking 50+ hour weeks for like a touch over $10,000 at the end of the year. Ugly, but I learned the ins and outs of running my own shop, which was necessary for later.<p>For now, look to grab some small wins. Try to not spend much too - if you can build your bank account up to the $50,000+ range over the next 2-3 years (very possible), then you'll be ready when you get a good opportunity to invest in some people, you can frontload marketing and distribution contracts for better economies of scale, you can test hire someone for six months if you meet a good person, you can throw in and get a share of a commercial real estate deal... look to live off of rice, ramen, cheap rent, minimal alcohol, the dollar menu at fast food restaurants, and bank all you make. Do a lot of little stuff, don't get arrogant and think anything is beneath you or not paying enough. You're 18, so everyone is going to write you off. It sucks, but all us young entrepreneurs went through it. You don't have a track record, and there's also a lot of things that you're not aware you don't know. Hustling and taking little projects, jobs, opportunities when possible helps fix both those problems, and can build the bank account for the bigger wins later.<p>Best wishes - I admire the ambition. Most of my friends were on a similar track at your age, and a lot of them have come out crazy-well just now into their mid to late 20's and early 30's.",1255252179

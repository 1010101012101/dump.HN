If you aren't running any of Oracle's other products, then it boils down to a pure technical decision - do you need feature X? Is it cheaper to buy it or build it?

The problem is that language and common usage don't make much of a distinction between the two. If you ask people how long a day is, they'll tell you 24 hours. Even Google will tell you that, but it isn't true. A day is usually 24 hours. DST and leap seconds can both change the length of a day though. So a day isn't a unit for measuring time at all. It's a name for a certain period of time. Leap seconds can even mess with terms that seem bulletproof like ""hour"" or ""minute"". When there's a leap second, one minute of the year becomes 61 seconds, and the corresponding hour becomes 3601 seconds.<p>The only unit of time you can reliably work with is the second (and metric derivations thereof, like millisecond).",1283345496

Perhaps we need some similar sort of due process for hosting providers or cloud providers.<p>Most appalling is Rackspace's lack of transparency in handling this.<p>Pandaform was never contacted by the complainant.  The complainant only contacted Rackspace.  Rackspace assumed, without investigation, the complaint was legitimate and gave the guy notice via email.<p>Also, the real rub, is the fact the Rackspace would terminate his account if he got a second complaint.<p>So, it is not necessary to have an actual phishing form on his site to have his Rackspace hosting terminated.  Someone simply needs to allege this to Rackspace, and his account and data will be gone forever.<p>That is fanatical?  Again, I cannot recommend Rackspace.",1283342700

The claim that states seem like they have different cultures if you consider it isn&#x27;t really helpful either:  The human brain loves imposing structure on things, so if you claim that a certain area is a single entity, naturally one&#x27;s tendency is to think of things as &quot;Californian&quot; or &quot;Arizonan&quot;, etc.  In much the same way, one thinks of an Italian living on the French border as ethnically Italian, and a guy living a few miles away as ethnically French.  Drawing arbitrary lines is convenient enough, but pretending there&#x27;s any sound reason behind these distinctions is silly (look at the recent history of Central/Eastern Europe to see exactly how arbitrary state lines are).<p>[1]  I&#x27;m referring specifically to the fact that it&#x27;s a well-studied phenomenon that the urban/suburban/rural divide in culture+values is becoming a lot more significant than the state-to-state ones.",1409035652

The aspiration that was being reflected there was that the US government could apply the same fervor, resources, and ingenuity to uplifting the poor that it had applied to WW1, WW2, and was then still applying to the Cold War. Because of that, I always felt like the phrase was a swords-into-plowshares type of saying rather than a militant one.<p>Of course, that was 50 years ago- as the phrase has gotten recycled for initiatives like the War on Drugs, it has lost that nuance and context, and sounds more like some zero-tolerance, overly militant government program (which parts of it were).

Most importantly, to understand the success or failure, you have to think about it, and its economics, like any other product on the market.  Granted, programming languages have different characteristics as products than lighthouses or tv shows or telephones, but they do share things with them that we can learn from.  This is a somewhat dated attempt of my own to share a bit of that thinking:<p><a href=""http://www.welton.it/articles/programming_language_economics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.welton.it/articles/programming_language_economics</a><p>A few other things:<p>* Like rdtsc says, Erlang does not fit the mold in a lot of ways.  It had a large corporate sponsor from the get-go, which was good for it in some ways (money for developers), and perhaps bad in others: lots of production code early on means it&#x27;s not possible to change stuff that is less than optimal.<p>* As per my article, new/small/unpopular languages need a niche, a beachhead if they are to gain traction.  You can&#x27;t create a new language and platform from scratch with an ecosystem as big as Java&#x27;s (indeed, piggybacking on the JVM is a popular strategy because of this), so you&#x27;d better have  one thing where you absolutely kick ass.  Erlang has this in spades, for instance.  Ruby had Rails.  Tcl had Tk and a few other &quot;killer apps&quot;. PHP was <i>way</i> easier to get started with than mod_perl, back in the day.  I don&#x27;t see this for Dylan, particularly, but then I don&#x27;t know much about it, so maybe it&#x27;s there somewhere, and BruceM will figure it out and the language will gain a following.",1409034275

I see a lot of similarities across state boundaries (for example: people think murder is bad) and a lot of differences within states (especially in the city vs. rural divide).  Lots of values aren&#x27;t even geographical (e.g. should religion be a part of public schools?).  Similarly, I&#x27;d say that most boarders are arbitrary and have very little lasting meaning, but whatever.<p>To try to answer your question.  I think there are common rules that make sense to apply globally (eg no murder, slavery, theft of private property, etc...), and some rules that should be very local (eg maximum sizes for billboards), and there&#x27;s some middle ground for things like regulation and management of watersheds.",1409033842

The criminal law is entirely up to the Canadian Parliament, and this is highly unlikely to ever fly in US. Further more, the courts have held that Canadian federal government can spend its money any way it likes to influence provincial policy. While the US Supreme court has allowed some percentage of money to be tied to state legislation (viz 21 year drinking age), it has also struck down laws which forces states to take up new spending or lose all the earlier grant from federal government (viz Medicare expansion in Obamacare). Each US state maintains its own Constitution and individual Judiciary, while the Canadian Supreme Court sits on top of any case of controversy in Canada,<p>US is much more federal than Canada, except may be for legal fiction where each Canadian province has their own relation to Crown. While Canadian federal government cannot outright strike out a state law, they almost never have to, as the power of Canadian federal government are almost endless where it really matter viz. criminal law, tax and spending.",1409033713

When I launched my SaaS app on Show HN, I managed to get 3 signups.  It may be peanuts for some people but for me it was really exciting.  It showed progress and gave me encouragement to continue.

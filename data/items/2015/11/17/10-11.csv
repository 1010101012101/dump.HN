Quantum entanglement is not &quot;computer code&quot;, but a situation where quantum state of two separate systems that cannot be factorized, which means it is not equivalent to any tensor product of separate quantum states for the two parts. Also, it does not mean the particles &quot;cease to exist except in relation to each other&quot;. Entanglement changes nothing for existence of particles, it only changes the calculated probabilities of results of measurements. I wonder why researchers allow their work to be misrepresented so much. Is it just for publicity and funding reasons?",1447757939

As much as we would like to believe that most people on the ground would make rational decisions in the face of such atrocities and not blame entire groups, the reality is never that simple. Emotions usually prevail and people end up blaming entire groups just through those groups&#x27; &#x27;guilt by association&#x27;.<p>The fact that this was said by someone who has faced such horrors on a daily basis before is extremely respectful.",1447757927
10580307,comment,10573399,10579579,0,0,bad_user,,,"The mathematical language is a &quot;pile of hieroglyphics&quot;, yet mathematicians can speak it just fine. And in fact without their domain specific language mathematics would be much, much harder to deal with. We know this because the mathematical language in use today is newer than the discipline of mathematics and we can make a before and after comparison.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t understand why some programmers insist on communicating only in english words. First of all because english words suffer from the problems of natural language, which is that natural language is imprecise, with the words having multiple meanings depending on surrounding context. For example when adding two numbers, should you use &quot;add&quot; or should you use &quot;plus&quot;? As it may be, &quot;add&quot; is actually incorrect according to its precise English definition, because the operation doesn&#x27;t necessarily lead to increasing the size or amount. Yet this does not stop people from using it. Fortunately classes like BigDecimal are using &quot;plus&quot;, yet I don&#x27;t get why in the world would anybody think that &quot;x.plus(y.multiply(z))&quot; is more readable than &quot;x + y * z&quot;.<p>You might thing picking on BigDecimal is a cheap shot. Well, how about the well known &quot;ListUtils.union(a, b)&quot; and why would that be better than &quot;a ++ b&quot;. Speaking of &quot;ListUtils.union&quot;, joining 2 lists is not a union, as union is in the context of sets or maps. Joining 2 lists is a concatenation and that matters, because concatenation is not commutative, whereas a union (of 2 sets or maps) is commutative. Basically the Apache Commons folks have got the naming wrong and if such mistakes happen in libraries that are so public, guess what happens inside corporate projects.<p>But much more problematic in languages like Java is not the wording as much as the way the logic is often expressed. In a functional programming language you usually get pure expressions that operate on immutable data-structures, pure as in true mathematical functions (for the same input you always get the same output). Such functions are much easier to reason about and much easier to test, because the output does not depend on some object&#x27;s history (or in other words, an object&#x27;s identity).<p>The worst and most unreadable code I&#x27;ve ever seen was written in Java, a language in which people often pass around mutable data-structures, like arrays, modifying them on the spot, for no good reason other than not knowing any better, in a dance of mutation that can only be considered an abomination of nature, with code so obtuse that it would make grown men cry. It&#x27;s not uncommon for pieces of code to be commented with &quot;here be dragons&quot; with people no longer understanding what it does. Couple that with &quot;enterprise design patterns&quot; based primarily on IoC containers and best practices spawned from hell, with deep layers of inheritance that don&#x27;t make sense and with chronic multi-threading issues and you&#x27;ve got a recipe for disaster. And you don&#x27;t even have to search for proof for too long. Take any reasonably sized open-source project and you&#x27;ll see this fact in all its glory. The last Java open-source project I interacted with is SpyMemcached and is a fine example of a Java project that works, that does its job well, that is reasonably well maintained, but that has internals that expose all the problems that I just mentioned. And sometimes I wonder why anything written in Java works at all, my guess being simply that people hit that code with the hammer until it quacks, in a process that resembles more natural evolution and mutation rather than engineering.<p>Therefore I&#x27;m personally dumbfounded by claims of readability. And in regards to the capabilities of an IDE, I do use IntelliJ IDEA, but I am wondering what the other 99% of its capabilities are, preferably that help with readability. Syntax highlighting?",1447757915
10580306,comment,10579526,10580138,0,0,fabulist,,,"I guess my bias is revealed in my conception that Tor browser is something everyone has lying around. If you aren&#x27;t using plugable transports, installing Tor browser is trivial (single-click configuration after you&#x27;ve extracted the archive).<p>In my experience, setting up a daemon to do something trivial is always &quot;not much effort&quot; until something goes wrong and you throw in the towel an hour and a half later. I suppose that SSH port forwarding is zero-configuration, however, so perhaps you&#x27;re right, and my suggestion is unnecessary.<p>I was really trying not to paint a picture of a malicious founder who is scheming to paper something over with spin. The founder responded in the thread because they&#x27;re an honest business person who feels tempted to use a piece of information that fell in their lap, as we all might.<p>That was a bad example, so I&#x27;m not going to try and defend why that conversation should happen on HN (you&#x27;re probably right that it shouldn&#x27;t). The reason someone might anonymously start a conversation on Hacker News would have to be that the community has a vested interest in it&#x27;s outcome, it is embarrassing to the influential, and the consequences of revealing it openly outweigh the perceived benefits.<p>But maybe my struggle to find a better example is indicative that this situation is too rare to account for.",1447757910

Do you want to be friends with invincible people who never need your assistance? Probably not if you are anything like me. Giving to other people makes us like them more, and this goes both ways. This is the Benjamin Franklin effect[1]<p>You have called out a desire to have more meaningful relationships, so I am not going to focus on meeting people, though the more people you meet the more you will find people with things in common.<p>Instead think about what makes deep connections? Shared experiences. Fellow feeling. Giving and accepting affection.<p>I am Australian and I am lucky enough to have moved to New York for work. I met some friends through Australian connections but the deepest connections I have made are through a random conversation at a networking event that led to some drinks, and then to an introduction to a group of like minded poets, artists and technologists.<p>But even then I felt on the outside.<p>The thing that changed that has been going to them for help with things in my life (support as I struggled with relationship trouble, homesickness, stress from work) as well as spending time in their company individually and as a group in both casual and more intense settings (camping). Part of the help I asked for I guess was their acceptance and approval of some poetry I was writing, which I performed for them. I guess that my thesis is shallow experiences make for shallow friendships and deep experiences (which by their nature require you to have your guard down) make deep friendships.<p>&quot;Breaking into a clique&quot; is a bad paradigm I think, you don&#x27;t want to break in, you want to be brought in.<p>The only other thing I would say is seek people who are also seeking.

The airlines have learned, often the hard way, that besides price, absolutely no other factors of any sort whatsoever are relevant. The vast majority of travelers will claim in surveys that they care about things like legroom, good service, not paying extra for a bag, etc., but then the instant you put them in front of a search page to choose a flight they proceed to choose based on price, only price and nothing but price.<p>Business travelers have higher standards, but they&#x27;re simply drowned out -- Scott Kirby (President of American Airlines) was recently quoted in media as claiming that, among unique passengers carried by AA, 87% fly one trip per year or less, and those flyers account for over half of the airline&#x27;s revenue.<p>Tellingly, this was used to justify AA joining Delta in rolling out a super-bare-bones fare class designed to compete for the &quot;choose based on price and only price&quot; market, and carrying similar restrictions and conditions to the standard tickets of the ultra-low-cost carriers like Spirit and Allegiant.<p>As an aside, it will be interesting to watch how this plays out in the next couple of years; Delta, which is generally the leader in implementing major changes among the three remaining big legacy carriers, has just announced changes which make their small number of extra-legroom coach seats, previously free for people holding status in their frequent-flier program, much harder to get without buying a ticket in a higher fare class (effectively, they now will sell those seats as a separate &quot;premium economy&quot; style cabin and fare, despite being neither a separate cabin nor anywhere close to the actual premium-economy offerings of European airlines). Since most business travelers are required to book into lower fare classes, on Delta they&#x27;ll be forced into knee-and-spine-crushing seats. Whether that will lead to decision-makers at those companies switching their contracts away from Delta, and thus finally claw back some ground from the ultra-price-sensitive race to the bottom prevailing in the industry, remains to be seen.",1447756241

I wrote off Haskell entirely for that very reason, and I&#x27;m not alone in having done so (search HN comments).<p>In fact, I would wager that if Haskell had not adopted such an unusual evaluation strategy, GHC would have required only a tenth of the manhours that have presently gone into it.

Also, because your personality is already mostly formed, it is hard to meet people that you fit with.  When you are very young, it&#x27;s easy to change yourself to fit the group of people you are with.<p>My biggest advice is not to rush it.  Take every opportunity to spend time with other people, but if you don&#x27;t &quot;click&quot;, don&#x27;t try to force it.  When I first came to Japan I spent a lot of time with people who spoke English.  It was something we had in common.  In the end it was the only thing we had in common.  I had some pretty bad experiences because I tried to hang on to friendships that really weren&#x27;t good for me or the other person.<p>As others have mentioned, hobbies are a good way to go.  Either find groups to do your hobbies with, or find some new hobbies that will help you meet new people.<p>One thing I have done in the past year (since I work from home, and often at night) is to wander around my neighbourhood and chat with the retired people where I live.  They are lonely too :-).",1447754463

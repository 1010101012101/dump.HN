RE: the vanilla preconfigured stacks- the VirtualAppliances.net guys and Spike Source are doing a pretty good job now with putting out lean versions of the basic software stacks so we're targeting the end-to-end apps for now.  We'll hit those up down the road though. thanks for the feedback.<p>sean",1175201228

7405,comment,7265,7314,0,0,domp,,,"Well I'd assume that a company would already be far along with development and brainstorming if they're looking for publicity like this. All they are expecting is pretty much a sales pitch, which a startup is probably already used to giving anyways. If not, videotaping yourself in such a way might be more important then developing or brainstorming.",1175201131

7397,comment,7294,7294,0,0,eli,,,"Interesting stuff. The cool thing about Slingshot is that it seems like it'll be relatively easy to bolt it on to existing Rails apps. For Apollo, I think you're pretty much going to have to build your apps for Apollo from the start.<p>\nThe downside to Slingshot (for some people) is that, since it's rails, you're gonna be sending at least part of your application's source code down to the client to make it work offline. I don't think that's such a big deal, but it could be a dealbreaker for some.<p>edit: see also: <a href=""http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/23/here-comes-competition-apollo/"">http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/23/here-comes-competition-apollo/</a>",1175200663

Evolution of vision neurons actually would have started out using a &quot;chance built&quot; circuit that could solve this 94-item &#x27;recognition&#x27; problem.  Then the DNA that solved the 94 would run repeatedly to recursively form the rest of the retina, giving the brain higher resolution, but using only one 94-pattern-solving DNA recursively. I think the major advancements in neural nets will come about once we start &quot;wiring up&quot; brains in interesting ways like this rather than the current &quot;layer training&quot; approach...The brain is recursive, and needs recursive wiring to be simulated.",1391900294

So if we want to compute C(10^10,50309) mod 10^8, for example, we only ever really need to carry numbers mod 10^8 around. And since (ab) mod c = (a mob c)(b mod c) we can avoid obtaining really large numbers and can safely hold them in unsigned long ints.<p>Since this problem is counting things, there is mostly like a recurrence-type relationship to it and at each step you would take the result mod N. Many combinatorics problems are like this. Although if you&#x27;ve only done 60 PE problems, then the ones in the 400s somewhat implicitly assume you&#x27;ve done the previous 400 since the ideas do built up.",1391899792

The device is nice, Nokia can surely make good hardware, however my problem is the OS.<p>The Metro UI is kind of nice, but it gets obnoxious. I&#x27;ve began to hate those animations. And when I do need in-your-face notifications, like for the weather or something, you don&#x27;t have the nice widgets that you get with Android.<p>Also, Microsoft is in charge of the Facebook app and I don&#x27;t get how in the world they managed to treat the login in that Facebook app as something separate than the phone&#x27;s accounts. I also want to be able to manage what accounts are synchronized or not - because synchronization uses battery, plus notifications are annoying and for many accounts I only want to view the latest messages or whatever only when I open the app - and haven&#x27;t found an option for doing so, unless you turn the battery savings on. While we are on the subject, the notifications bar is a joke.<p>The app store is full of crap. Microsoft has played the app numbers game, allowing some genuine crap in their store. Of course, both Google Play and iTunes are filled with crap, but the search and the ratings are usually enough for finding good stuff and both Google Play and iTunes also have very polished, very good apps for everything.<p>But the above don&#x27;t really bother me as much as my last point - Windows Phone is at its core as restrictive as iOS. It does not allow installs of apps from third party sources and is basically defective by design ... for example, to do Wifi tethering, the mobile career has to wire you the settings that allow it.

It&#x27;s obvious that resetting the sync key wiped out your synced data; the synced data was encrypted with the old key and generating a new one obviously wouldn&#x27;t let you decrypt it. (It&#x27;s possible the old key can still be used to recover the data, but I&#x27;m not sure).<p>Complaining that it demanded a pair code is like complaining that gmail asks you for a 2fa code after you&#x27;ve turned on 2fa. Of <i>course</i> it does, that&#x27;s how the security works.<p>Of course, the pair code system is kind of a pain, so they introduced passwords. But the pair code system <i>does</i> work if you use it correctly. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair to call it &#x27;completely borked&#x27; when your problems are entirely down to user error.<p>Keep in mind that Firefox Sync always protects all your profile data; Mozilla can&#x27;t access it because <i>your</i> machines encrypt it. This is unlike Chrome&#x27;s profile sync where all the data lives on Google&#x27;s servers and is accessible to them.

7203108,comment,7201353,7203004,2,0,derefr,,,"> If I want to display fresh personalized session-specific content on my /home page, why should I force the client to download a generic /home page, then download my JS, then run an AJAX request, when she could just send a cookie in the initial request for /home and get back an (uncacheable) personalized response?<p>Your server shouldn&#x27;t have to do O(N) units of work to serve a static page to N people. The entire <i>point</i> of GET-idempotency is that you can reduce serving your home page to O(1) units of work <i>for you</i>: you render the page, once, and it gets cached by a CDN, like Cloudflare. This necessitates customization either on the client-side, or not at all. Doing anything other than these is breaking the web[1].<p>(Besides, you don&#x27;t necessarily have to do an AJAX request for every previously-would-have-been-customized page. Edge-side-include type stuff (e.g. username+id, viewing preferences) is, literally, what localStorage was created to store. You only have to get that type of stuff once.)<p>> Session fixation. Users might try to share links containing session IDs. Session IDs leak out via URL history and referrers; URLs show up in the darndest places.<p>As I said, proper TLS and CORS (where things like adding &quot;noreferrer&quot; to all external links is as much a requirement for proper CORS as not loading external images) generally takes care of this.<p>But you&#x27;re right, there is a use for cookies. It&#x27;s not to hold your session token, though. Instead, it&#x27;s to hold a <i>client fingerprint token</i>, given to the client the first time they speak to you.<p>A client fingerprint is anything that <i>authenticates</i> a session token. If you say &quot;give me /sessions/foo/...&quot; and you don&#x27;t send foo&#x27;s associated fingerprint, the server 403s you at the load-balancer level.<p>Session fingerprints are already a common concept: some people use the user&#x27;s IP address, or their browser UA string, or something, as a fingerprint. These have a pretty horrible UX, though, because these things can change unintentionally (e.g. a mobile connection switching cells.) But users expect that clearing their cookies will log them out of things, so the cookie store is a pretty good place to put these. Then, leaking a URL with the session token does nothing, because it doesn&#x27;t share session secret (the fingerprint), just the identifier.<p>How is this different from just putting the session token in the cookie store? Mainly in that the client fingerprint doesn&#x27;t represent <i>you</i>, it represents <i>your machine.</i> The point of it is to pair your browser to the server. You can log in and out as many times as you like, but it&#x27;ll all happen under the same &quot;client.&quot;<p>Note that if browsers actually chose to start emitting a unique, persistent, per-site client fingerprint as a header (like the iOS &quot;Vendor/Advertising ID&quot;), this would supplant the <i>client fingerprint token</i> -- but do nothing to replace the session token. They&#x27;re separate things.<p>Note also that while the session token is part of the URL (and thus part of determining cacheability), the client fingerprint isn&#x27;t. This should be obvious, but its implication isn&#x27;t, necessarily: past your load balancer (which authenticates sessions against client fingerprints)  <i>cookies</i> cease to exist; they should not be passed to your backend servers. The client, and your backend, operate on pure resources; the client fingerprint becomes a transparent part of the HTTP protocol, invisible to both sides. Gives a much stronger meaning to &quot;HTTPOnly.&quot;<p>---<p>[1] And it&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s bad to break the web, really; you&#x27;re not hurting anyone else&#x27;s site than your own when you do this. It&#x27;s just that HATEOAS gives you some really great guarantees, and pretty much everyone who throws these guarantees away finds themselves re-building the web on top of itself to try to get these guarantees <i>back.</i><p>Matryosha caching middleware, for instance, is what you&#x27;re forced to deal with when you&#x27;re trying to build up a complex view within the scope of a single web request. If you instead just use a service-oriented architecture, where each service that needs information from sub-resources makes requests through the public API of the web server (the same one you want clients to use), you&#x27;ll get caching automatically, because all the sub-resources you&#x27;re requesting are inherently cacheable, and thus automatically cached.",1391898834

After all memory is much faster than disk, right?  Be careful with this, Go&#x27;s http FileServer uses sendto on platforms that support it and because it bypasses the userland/kernel barrier and can thus do a zero-copy transmission, sendto (in combination with OS-level file caching) will almost certainly outperform your in-memory caching.<p>If you really want to optimize transmission, one way to do it (if you&#x27;re serving mostly data that isn&#x27;t already naturally compressed) is to gzip everything that is gzip-friendly either in a post-compile step or at runtime, and then serve an on-disk-cached (filename).gz version instead of (filename) with appropriate headers (and checking client headers to make sure they can accept gzip content), but still using the internal FileServer logic to make use of the sendto functionality.  Go&#x27;s internal http stuff is very comprehensive but it is an API and not really a framework and it doesn&#x27;t try to do anything clever with gzipping of content.<p>As always, whenever &quot;optimizing&quot; make sure you measure extensively to make sure you&#x27;re actually helping and not making things worse.",1391898070

That&#x27;s not good -- usually cryptosystems are designed to have a probability of failure between 2^-80 and 2^-256.<p>The failure cases are different though. Cryptosystems that require a strength of 80 to 256 bits are measuring their strength against an adversary brute-forcing or performing some other active discovery.<p>In this case, it&#x27;s just the probability that two users will pick the same password and get the same salt. The attacker doesn&#x27;t get to run many guesses, the database is just leaked &#x27;as-is&#x27; and the hashes either show equality or they don&#x27;t. So there is only a 1 in ~8mil chance that two in that group will show equality. Not bad for such a large population.<p>It doesn&#x27;t then multiply up for each population. It&#x27;s a sum since they are independent groups. Even then, the probability for each subsequent group will be vastly smaller as the population size decreases.<p>Finally, the only population at risk is users that chose such blindingly obvious passwords that they ended up in a large password population pool.

It just means your hoping you don&#x27;t get caught.<p>Another example? The pirateat40 Ponzi scheme and the creation of &quot;Pirate pass-through&quot; schemes. He claimed to offer 7% interest WEEKLY and Bitcoiners ate it up despite its obvious impossibility. And again they tried to securitize that by selling &quot;shares&quot; in and/or &quot;insuring&quot; their investments, and so on—all without acknowledging there&#x27;s any form of legal or regulatory process to go through when doing such things.<p>Bitcoin is a total clown show, the history of economics repeated in fast-forward so anarcho-capitalists/libertarians can learn first hand why laws and regulations were invented.",1391896966

I don&#x27;t think I understand your point because I don&#x27;t think you know what your point is.<p>Are you trying to advance the theory that <i>management</i> had no hand in the terrible decision-making around TMI, including the numerous shortcuts that Cringely noted (nb: you are hardly using an <i>engineering</i> approach when you resort to ad hominem criticism of Cringely as a &quot;journalist&quot; without responding to any of the legitimate problems he noted). Or are you trying to advance the theory that no engineering mistakes were made at TMI?<p>And are you trying to advance the theory here that somehow, magically, <i>management</i> will not continue to make NASA-like <i>management</i> mistakes in current and future nuclear facilities?<p>Because if so, that&#x27;s <i>precisely</i> Feynman&#x27;s point, which you seem to be ignoring.<p>And c&#x27;mon, you&#x27;re merely moving goal-posts around when you focus on the severity of Chernobyl vs TMI. That isn&#x27;t speaking at all to how technology was misused in both instances by people making exactly the kinds of errors Feynman emphasizes.<p>> A Chernobyl-style incident will <i>never</i> happen with a LWR reactor [emphasis added]. That much is known, and the experts - nuclear engineers - are <i>unanimous</i> on this point [emphasis added].<p>Really? <i>Never?</i> <i>Unanimous</i>? That sounds like a really interesting <i>engineering</i> judgment. Could you kindly link to the unanimous consensus statement from <i>nuclear engineers</i> that support that strong but odd statement?<p>Because that sounds an awful lot like NASA management who claimed that the chances of loss of a space shuttle were so remote as to be negligible.<p>And your statement is even more curious when we read review papers like the one[1] from <i>nuclear engineer</i> Bah Sehgal[2] of the National Academy of <i>Engineering</i>, who concludes:<p>&quot;The presently-installed LWR plants in Western countries have been addressing their safety performance from the day they were installed and operating...<i>Clearly, not all the severe accident issues have been resolved for the presently-installed plants</i> [emphasis added].<p>&quot;The presently-installed LWR plants made improvements in components, systems, operator training, man-machine interface, safety culture, etc., thereby significantly reducing the probability of a severe accident occurring. They also instituted severe accident management backfits, systems and procedures, which are providing assurance of the elimination of an uncontrolled and large release of radioactivity even in case a severe accident occurs. <i>Still, the presently-installed plants can not provide assurance of coolability of a melt pool/debris bed, which could be formed during a bounding severe accident. In that situation, the LWR owner can not assure the public that the accident has been terminated and that there is no further danger of the release of radioactivity.</i> [emphasis added]&quot;<p>Sorry. It is you with your pronouncements of <i>never</i> who is absolutely not getting Feynman&#x27;s point whatsoever. In particular, he decried <i>management</i> and others with their own wishful pronouncements of <i>never</i>, which stood in stark contrast with the concerns of <i>engineers</i> who were well aware that there were quantifiable and real risks associated with their technology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.kns.org/jknsfile/v38/JK0380697.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kns.org/jknsfile/v38/JK0380697.pdf</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.nae.edu/69277.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nae.edu/69277.aspx</a>",1391896882

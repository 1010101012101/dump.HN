So you&#x27;re right in that it&#x27;s more likely a small time, not-black-market-rich troll rather than someone more dangerous.<p>There&#x27;s a couple ways to interpret that.  One is that he didn&#x27;t have money because he crowdsourced his scheme, which I think is fallacious on a few levels (e.g. maybe he crowdsourced it because it was a community rep thing, and he wanted to be seen organizing it).  The other is that he only sent the heroin because he didn&#x27;t have the money to hire the killer <i>which he would have if he had the money</i>, which is how I read it.  Perhaps you meant the former. but my replies were meant to address the latter.

(Let&#x27;s say $75k or $100k or whatever makes a person an obvious net-bonus to society rather than net loss.) They can stay on that visa as long as they retain employment with any firm for that amount.<p>If a person has demonstrated merit justifying a six figure job, why prevent them from entering your country and staying? They&#x27;ll be a net win for your economy. It seems like this would solve a lot of immigration problems in high-skill fields.<p>I&#x27;m not saying we should casually make this possible without deep thought, but as an immigration idea it seems appealing to me. Simplify the system and reduce it to an issue of whether the person can pull their weight. I suppose the downside is that any rich person who owns a company can allow virtually anyone they want to immigrate, as a &quot;fake employee&quot; of the firm. There should be oversight. Full time employment required, and proof of compensation in the way of wages, IRS review.<p>I suppose it wouldn&#x27;t help YC founders.

For that matter, bin Laden was hardly ‘‘in hiding’’ at all; his compound in Abbottabad was actually a safe house, maintained by the Pakistani intelligence service.

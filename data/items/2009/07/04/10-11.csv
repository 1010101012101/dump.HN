687072,comment,686853,686986,0,0,uriel,,,"ioctl was a mistake by people that didn't understand the ""everything is a file principle"" (a <i>huge</i> mistake I might add).<p>The original Unix from Bell Labs had no ioctl, Plan 9 has no ioctl, and the Linux people have been claiming to want to eventually get rid of all ioctls due to all the problems they cause, but the inertia and all the people that seem incapable of writing interfaces without ioctl means it will be ages before they get there.",1246704830
687071,comment,686853,686946,0,0,uriel,,,"While I think REST is great (and the only hope for some sanity in the future of the web), it doesn't seem fundamentally different from the ""everything is a file"" model, except for some historical limitations (like making navigation of the resource/file hierarchy extremely painful due to no standardized way to list resources/files).",1246704646

I'm not saying Facebook/Twitter or even Wave is the future... but something else than email is, and we'll probably see it within a year or two.",1246704539

I was refering to the fact that you do not make the difference between ""true"" and ""provable"", which can be found in any standard introductory book on logic; or, if you prefer a novel, Hofstadter's Goedel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid.",1246703638

I feel the tablet would be used in places where you couldn't contribute (very much) anyway: in the train, in bed before going to sleep, etc.  I like the idea of being able to add a keyboard though.  If the price is good, I don't see any reason not to buy one.",1246703024

This person is physically located in the country, speaks English, and can actually perform the tasks you ask of him.<p>It's amazing.  You ask about some obscure technical issue, and he digs in and fixes it.  On the spot.  The guy who answered the phone!<p>They charge about 5 pounds a month more than the big guys, which is more than worth it.  I hope that more companies like this will start springing up in other areas.",1246702680

It's always piqued my interest but a lot of the online material is a bit too mathematical for me to handle without some serious revision :) for stuff like this I also prefer book form. But recently I got much more to grips with the idea and it's the kind of thing I'd love to consider properly in idle moments :)<p>Can anyone recommend a really good book on the problem (I'm struggling to find any good recommendations). Something that isn't too math's heavy (or at least reminds you of the basics as necessary) that can walk you through the problem and set out some (non-too-mathematical) examples.<p>Preferably something a bit light-hearted :)",1246702195

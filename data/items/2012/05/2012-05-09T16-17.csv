I always have a hard time keeping track of what things I want to do on a trip, as well as when/where I already have things scheduled during the trip.<p>To scratch that itch, I built a tool to (1) collect things from around the internet that I might want to do on the trip and (2) help organize them in a visual way. Minimundo is the result.<p>I'd love any feedback people have, especially anything regarding what does/doesn't make sense. I'd also love any suggestions for promoting the site. Thanks!",1336582691

Good stuff made by craftsmen is, of course, much more expensive than crap glued together by slave labor. So spend double or triple. The craftsmen who make the good stuff do not put up with crap from the big box stores and maintain a certain level of distribution exclusivity. You might have to go to a higher end department store, like bloomingdales or saks, to even find the stuff.<p>The other signal is nation of manufacture. Anybody left making things in America or Northern Europe is probably good. Sadly, made in Italy doesn't mean much anymore because in the south there are many sweatshops full of chinese slaves cranking out stuff on which to stamp ""made in italy"".<p>> the reason for which all restaurants being unhealthy<p>All restaurants are not unhealthy.

Also, I know quite a few academics who tweet about their research but these are definitely the exception rather than the norm.<p>A simple reason as to why academics aren't ""socially connected"" is that they don't need to be. The academic social network exists informally and is more tightly knit than a social network of say programmers, so I don't necessarily have to be your facebook friend or follow you on twitter to be able to get in touch with you through 2-3 hops<p>As far as blogs are concerned, one reason to write blogs is for purely didactic purposes. I definitely know tons of Grad students who use to prepare their notes and put them on their web pages or local servers to fulfill that need. The other reason: To transmit your ideas to wider audience is much a more harder problem to solve. Mathematical abstractions get progressively harder to communicate if your understanding of the basics is weak, example, you would definitely need a background in vector spaces to understand functional analysis. I remember reading a blog recently where the author ( a machine learning academic) had written about his experience in implementing a stochastic gradient solver for online learning in Clojure: There were a couple of comments complaining that there was no context. While, I definitely see where those folks are coming from, it would take too long and a good deal more posts to be able to break down a couple of book's worth of ideas before you get to what you want to talk about.",1336581820

2. You can alter chords with substitutions, effectively creating a ""chord abstraction theory"".
3. If you can get abstract about chords, and that lets you play similar chords where other chords are, then you can do the same thing with scales.<p>They then just play fewer chords. If you only have 3, or even 1 chord, then you can simply stay in one key and solo all day long.  You can then go outside the key to add tension with dissonant notes by picking a new ""abstraction"".<p>This reduction in the number of chords in the song then lets you play with abstractions on the chords being used.  You can start doing substitutions with chords that are similar to give the song a feeling of progression where there really is none.<p>If I remember correctly, Freddie Hubbard's ""Mr. Clean"" is just a F-7 chord for the whole song, but check out what they do with it:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5CNYsmAJwI"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5CNYsmAJwI</a><p>BTW, I hate that song.",1336581093

It is ripe for disruption.<p>More often than not, the content that gets published is created by the same institutions that are forced to pay for Elsevier's services. Elsevier acts as the middleman. Institutions pay academics to produce journal articles. After production and peer-review, ownership of the scholarly work is transferred over to a publisher. The institution must then pay to reacquire the same content they helped produce. In the past this made sense as distribution involved printing and mailing thousands of pages worth of journal articles.

The defense team is simply not aware of what the threat teams are capable of, or the extent to which attacks are being specially and carefully crafted to target individual companies.<p>It's important to understand how common this is. For years most companies have not had to worry much about security because they were not previously targets. Now they are the targets of attacks that are carefully researched and crafted to target their particular vulnerabilities, and in many cases actual specific employees or users.<p>So most companies are playing catch up. First, they are having to learn much more about the details of the full stack of their technology, from the hardware firmware through the OS, applications, local networking, and internetworking. It's no longer enough to trust vendors, which for years was the corporate way.<p>Second, to speed this up, they are trying to figure out how they can learn from each other, from security experts, and from the government without triggering all sorts of legal consequences like shareholder lawsuits, antitrust investigations, privacy lawsuits, etc.<p>This is where the desire for bills like CISPA comes from--to simplify what appears to them to be a legal minefield.

You can seek out many ""made in America"" products at a higher price point and with a lifetime warranty. I recently ordered a Duluth Pack bag. It cost triple the walmart/target equivalent. But it will likely last the rest of my life, and if it doesn't it is guaranteed.<p>I have had my two pairs of Allen Edmonds (made in America) shoes resoled a few times. They've lasted many years and will probably last another 10, perhaps even the rest of my life. Likewise my Red Wing boots are tanks.<p>A lot of high quality, made to last stuff is available. It's just expensive and people are stupid cheap. And Americans are <i>especially</i> stupid cheap. Why buy a crap $250 suit that will disintegrate in a matter of years? Shell out for the fly made in America Hickey Freeman suit that will last forever, man.",1336579480

(though I lack the skills myself to code it).<p>1.  I assume you're going to be adding new stuff to it daily ?For example a quick glance in the videogames section and a few 'popular' podcasts I listen to are missing.<p>2. Would be great if you could ""bookmark"" a point in a podcast.  Here's my thinking. typically I would use this app at work where I can't install itunes. So if I'm in the middle of a podcast and the day is done, I can bookmark and resume tomorrow. (just one simple use case example)<p>3. Are you planning to add a rating system to it? One of the major problems I have with itunes is it's hard to find stuff because there's just SO MUCH. (doesn't make sense I know..)<p>All in all great app and I'm sure I'll be on it pretty regular.<p>p.s. cool domain name, can't believe it wasn't taken!!",1336579426

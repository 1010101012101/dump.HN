9052487,comment,9048772,9050887,0,0,bsbechtel,,,">>As far as most people are concerned, the premise that all violence is absolutely unnecessary is not a widely held position.<p>This is a straw man that, quite frankly, I&#x27;m left scratching my head as to where you got it from. People commit violence when they can get something they want by doing so, and won&#x27;t face repercussions for the violent act. The places around the world that are widely considered the most violent countries are those that have strong (sometimes authoritarian) central governments, and few rights individuals can exercise to protect themselves on a local level. Examples - China, Russia, Brazil, the Middle East.<p>The reason this is the case is because the vast majority of citizens in these locations are law-abiding citizens, meaning they won&#x27;t break the law to own a gun to protect themselves, or take other measures necessary to ensure their own protection, other than depending on the government (either local or national). Then, what happens is government law enforcement fails, because we&#x27;re human and we all make mistakes - national law enforcement may not be present, local law enforcement may be corrupt or incompetent, or hundreds of other reasons failure could take place. When the law enforcement fails though, regardless of the reason, those law abiding citizens who don&#x27;t have any means of protecting themselves are now vulnerable to pretty much anyone.<p>I hope you realize, and can think deeply enough, to understand that the problem of violence is not one that has a binary solution to be solved only via monopoly powers of government. There are literally thousands of creative ideas that can be tried to combat violence...before resorting to coercion by the State. If you read the other posts here, you would understand how those ideas could be explored, and also why they have pretty much died out.<p>No libertarian or anarcho-liberterian lives in a fantasy world where they think they can just &#x27;wish away&#x27; violence. They just understand the answer to violence is not as simple as a vote for &#x27;yes&#x27; or &#x27;no&#x27; on a ballot box. If that&#x27;s the world you wish to live, then great. If not, I suggest you open your mind a bit, expand your thinking, and at least consider what the other side has to say.",1424005029

I.e. less (political) propaganda and more good old (commercial) PR.<p>If I&#x27;d have to say anything good about RT versus other international news channels, it&#x27;s their coverage of the protests in Turkey. Even in Germany (where Turkey is seen as no more foreign than Greece or Italy and a significant share of the population has ties to Turkey) the protests were at best a footnote of the regular news reporting. RT on the other hand would have reporters right in the middle of it, getting teargassed and documenting the different motivations for the various groups involved.<p>Oh, and of course our media was extremely supportive of the rebellion in Syria despite the growing influence of Islamist groups. Until they decided to change directions completely when ISIS/ISIL showed up. And now they refer to them (supposedly objectively!) as &quot;terror militia IS&quot;.<p>Frankly, calling anything a &quot;terror militia&quot; while pretending to be objective is pretty damn insulting. It completely discards any notion of them having any motives or being in fact humans. It&#x27;s how you talk about an enemy in your propaganda when you&#x27;re at war, it&#x27;s not how you cover a news story.<p>Calling German media &quot;LÃ¼genpresse&quot; is silly, but not because it&#x27;s outrageously inaccurate. It&#x27;s silly because all media is inadvertently lying. You can&#x27;t just present the &quot;facts&quot; because they&#x27;re inconsistent, disjointed and confusing (because they&#x27;re not only incomplete, but also always subjective). But as soon as you start to create a narrative, you&#x27;re simplifying the facts and introducing a biased perspective. Yet you have to create narratives to make the news relateable and interesting to your audience (and stakeholders).<p>What&#x27;s the alternative? I don&#x27;t think there is one. Blogging and &quot;YouTube journalism&quot; is a start, but it&#x27;s already been subverted at this point. It&#x27;s no more difficult to feed misleading or biased information via individual &quot;citizen reporters&quot; than it is to influence corporate/national media. I guess correct attribution would go a long way, but now that &quot;official&quot; news programmes directly copy YouTube videos and online articles seem to be more about editorialising than citing the actual sources, I don&#x27;t see that happening -- no party (other than the audience) would benefit from more accountability in the news, sadly.",1424003135

This is a scary fact of life in the human arena. And though this is not the first time that technology has advanced so far so fast, some pretty scary basic concerns about governance and fundamental rights have been raised in recent years.<p>Eventually, in the midst of the well-wishers there will come those souls who are not good actors, and they do seem to seem to spoil the bunch sometimes - don&#x27;t they?<p>Given enough power, anything is worthy of unusual inspection. Similarly, the current success of Uber is no different. Regardless of whether the social, political and market narratives about Uber are currently accurate, fair or not, it is the sudden nature of company power and the driving essential questions around the nature of new economies that compel articles like these. Uber and AirBnB are challenging fundamental labor and property rights shibboleths, and demanding real consideration from people across the philosophical, commercial, and political realms.<p>Similarly, the 20th century spread of dictatorial socialism was incredible. No matter how much I try to sympathize with the promises of various ideologies, I always return to the premise that in all circumstances, it is the CONCENTRATION OF POWER that is the problem. It is even more disturbing for pragmatists and empiricists when they see something moving fast that is denying anyone the chance to scrutinize, test and debate the merits of the method, the motives, the means.<p>As a good friend says though - it is easy to make these conceptions &quot;heuristics&quot; and see someone&#x27;s intent as globally bad. Some people&#x27;s intentions can be good and means and methodology sound. Yet with data as with literacy at large, the medium by which the person&#x27;t intent is made manifest is the very means by which the power will be exercised and the rules challenged. In this case, massive volumes of data are being generated that have multi-dimensional consequences for all humankind. This IS a concentration of power. Even though a witch hunt is far from a beautiful thing, the world citizen has very real reason to be concerned, and truly should be immediately concerned, about the very topics that are daily discussion here on HN. Matters of technology, privacy, rights, commerce and liberty are not weak, and neither are musings on the mating habits of whales.. from time to time.<p>HN is a fount of a certain kind of literacy. How does that literacy get expanded to all, and seen as a human right?",1424003111

9052403,comment,9045239,9045239,0,0,jfaucett,,,"I see your experience and I&#x27;m going to be honest with you about a couple things, because I went the same route in many ways, I&#x27;m completely self-taught on everything, worked as a web developer through school to help pay my non-CS degree and then got a job in web development after graduation. You don&#x27;t say it explicitly but you seem to imply your not a CS major so thats what I&#x27;m assuming.<p>First and most important &quot;most projects don&#x27;t get completed because only one thing which i couldn&#x27;t figure out, & could be explained to me by 9 min in person help.&quot; This is the worst thing you can say as a self-taught dev. You have to be able to just &quot;figure things out&quot;. You have to get projects finished and have a portfolio to get a job, If you can&#x27;t do this you might seriously want to reconsider a career in webdev because regardless you will always be in the situation where you have to solve a problem and nobody is there to help you. Maybe if you have a CS degree things are different but this is not the case when you&#x27;re self-taught. As a self-taught guy its all about what you&#x27;ve done and can SHOW that you can do. So remember your Portfolio is everything, work on it, make sure its good but remember it doesn&#x27;t have to be chalk full of tons of stuff, actually just one very good example that makes people say WOW is more than enough to get a good Job.<p>I know its hard to force yourself through to getting the projects completed, especially when you don&#x27;t know how to do something, but the internet is full of tutorials and guides and tons of source code, of which you should be reading a lot and trying to understand it. Reading source code was my number one way to educate myself, and I still recommend this and do it when I need to understand something new. If you don&#x27;t understand something, take the DOM for instance, read the jQuery source, write your own functions and libraries and then you will know how it works and about its quirks. In college you still have time to do a lot of this.<p>&quot;in ads i see salaries from 30k to 190k .. where do i fit?&quot; Right now from what you say, you&#x27;ll be lucky to get a 30k Job - thats my honest opinion.<p>So my advice on how to get the 80k job is this:<p>Write code and finish your projects, forget about learning node/express/mongoose etc. If you need to know it to build a project then learn it. Nobody cares if all you know is CSS/HTML and JS if you show them some amazing site you designed and built a frontend for, they will hire you. At the end of the day, tech-stacks don&#x27;t matter because its assumed you can learn/are willing to learn anything. So do whatever it takes to get some completed projects under your belt and you&#x27;ll be good to go.",1424001775

TAs don&#x27;t grow on trees and transcribing captions for all the lectures would use up their full 20hrs/week.

Good commercial transcription service costs about ~$150/hour with markups for difficult video (bad audio quality, accents, obscure subject vocabulary) but an institution doing a lot of business will get a discount.<p>An advantage of bringing the suit is it brings in the federal government as &quot;referee.&quot; The advocates have their ideas about what &quot;the right thing&quot; is and Harvard administrators and lawyers will have their own but the feds will basically create regulation for how these long-standing laws should be applied in these cases.

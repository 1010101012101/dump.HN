8744874,comment,8744527,8744780,0,0,adventured,,,"There are at least three reasons Norway would be interesting.<p>1) The soon to be trillion dollar sovereign fund, in a country of only 5.x million people. If you&#x27;re going to be a hyper rich, very small nation, there will always be someone envious or potentially willing to threaten you - at least if we&#x27;re considering history. The sovereign fund can move markets, seeing as it&#x27;s one of the largest single pots of managed money on earth. Norway is also starting to get into the US oil market, with interest in the bakken; that will inherently draw the attention of US national security interests.<p>2) Natural gas and oil. These are understood, and are of meaningful strategic importance to Europe.<p>3) Large coastline, close to Russia. Norway has more land than Poland, and nearly as much as Germany. With only 5 million people, in Europe, that&#x27;s a big deal.<p>Let&#x27;s consider the case of a country of equal geographic size, with a large coastline, on the other side of the world: Vietnam.<p>Vietnam has 90 million people. So they have 18 times as many people as Norway, with an economy 1/3 the size of Norway. Has Vietnam been of interest to its neighbors and foreign powers in the past century? Big time. If a country like Vietnam can be so interesting, just imagine how interesting Norway is.<p>If this were 1933, and Norway had 5 million people, sitting on all that oil and natural gas, with a trillion dollar sovereign fund, they&#x27;d be a prime target. I think it&#x27;s extremely naive to think history is over, when it comes to that sort of behavior, even though it&#x27;s hard to imagine it coming from anywhere but Russia today (in Europe).",1418468204

Then after a year more they could show that icon in <i>red</i>. After another year, they could give a light pop-up warning, and after a year more, they could put an aggressive malware-like (hey, it&#x27;s not <i>too</i> far from the truth when NSA and GCHQ are firehosing and datamining all plain-text connections...) red pop-up warning that says the connection is insecure.<p>Then after a year more, they could even grey out or take out the &quot;continue&quot; button, and only provide a small link instead, so most people run away from that site.<p>I think 5 years (2020) is a reasonable time period to get to that point. If 7 years after the Snowden revelations we don&#x27;t even have most of the Internet secured with HTTPS, then we really suck and deserve the totalitarian regimes coming at us (it won&#x27;t be just the 5 Eyes doing mass spying in 2020).<p>Besides, it&#x27;s not what the users think that matters, it&#x27;s what the web developers do knowing that in 2 years their site will have an insecure red icon and in 3 years it will have a pop-up warning, and in 5 years users will essentially be driven away from their site. Even if 90 percent of the traffic keeps clicking through the warnings, can they live knowing their site shows that to the users?

If I run &quot;G&quot; again it&#x27;ll get the entire file again.<p>Now, I want to match these against another list of users. I&#x27;ll do a similar trick:<p><pre><code>    D:{d::0:&quot;S&quot;$&quot;:&quot;,x}\n</code></pre>\nand now I can do: D&quot;users.txt&quot; to put this into the d variable.<p>My program needs to find the rows of g that d match.<p>Some of the sessionids in the logfiles are corrupt. They look like this instead:<p><pre><code>    7241110807448127691320303160517889791474867567241110807448127691320312936057606400732600664532969577042775 4\n    62349552899220301013203170219134834182361546234955289922030101320303170219134834182361546234955289922030101 4\n</code></pre>\nThese are wrong. I originally tried to figure out them by finding the longest string that was also at the beginning of the sessionid, but after talking it out with Oleg and Pierre I decided to try to simply match them against the lengths of d:<p><pre><code>    ?:#:&#x27;d\n</code></pre>\nsaid I only have two lengths (19 and 20), so this is a much smaller search than what I was trying before!<p>To do this, I used views:<p><pre><code>    K::?:#:&#x27;d\n    k::&quot;S&quot;$&quot;S&quot;,/:$:&#x27;K\n    f::k!+(K#\:/:g.s)\n</code></pre>\nNow f is an index on g; instead of a `s column it has an `Sn column where n is length of the key; i.e. I have a `S19 and an `S20 column with the first 19 characters of `s and the first 20 characters of `s accordingly.<p><pre><code>    s::g.s[&|/f[k]in\:d]\n    c::g.c[&|/f[k]in\:d]\n</code></pre>\nNow I can look at the `s and `c vars and do what I want to do; get my unique userids and my counts.<p><i>More importantly</i>, I can apply this to all my files (I have a lot of them):<p><pre><code>    n:0;m:0;{G x;n+:+/c;m+:+/g.c}&#x27;t</code></pre>",1418466757

Sure, they have lots of oil but its undisputed Norwegian and they sell it willingly. Sure, they are NATO members and at present the NATO secretary general is Norwegian, and they do participate in NATO actions in the Middle East. But their own military is modest, barely capable of defending Norway if it came down to it. And Norway has little say over the other NATO countries.<p>I think the NATO secretary general, Stoltenberg, said it best himself when he described the Norwegian democracy as a fax democracy where Norwegian officials sit at a fax machine waiting for the latest directive from Brussels (Norway is not an EU member but part of the European Economic Area and must adopt most EU rules in order to keep their access to the Euroean single market).<p>Anyone thinking that Norway has any real powers or impose a threat to anyone in the next 5-10 decades is delusional.<p>So why and to whom is it vital to spy on these fax politicians whose international influence barely exceeds that of an American senator or governor or a member of a German Landtag?",1418465266

Only one of them was ever able to complete a course successfully, and that was with immense effort. He basically spent more effort on one course than the rest of the students spent on the entire curriculum. It was inspiring to see the drive he had, but it&#x27;s not feasible to complete a whole major that way. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s related to age or just that the people who apply later in life are statistically different than those who apply out of high school.",1418465253

The reason for 280 days or 9 months is because that measures the time span since the last menstruation, not since conception.<p>(I was personally a bit surprised by this when expecting our first child.

I imagine removing it from RHEL 7 won&#x27;t go well over either.<p>Ubuntu is not the Universal Operating System, that&#x27;s Debian. This means that Ubuntu is definitely opinionated in its software selection, and rightly so. You couldn&#x27;t replace Upstart and now Ubuntu relies on systemd. If you have the skills to fully evaluate the costs and benefits of mixing and matching random pieces of software, distribution like Debian or Gentoo may be a better fit for you.<p>Indeed, switching to sysvinit in Debian is trivial and the systemd team worked really really hard to make sure the transition is smooth even if one keeps switching back and forth. They should really be praised for the effort they&#x27;ve put in it.",1418465067

Given the choice of where to deploy the artillery, the general may choose to concentrate their fire on the narrow beachhead landing instead of upon a widely scattered formation of units approaching across a vast plain.<p>The artillery that lands on the plain may strike an advancing unit, or it may fall (possibly harmlessly) between a set of advancing units. The artillery that lands on the narrow beachhead is more likely to hit a unit.<p>This analogy is far from perfect: sometimes mutations are good, which is one primary driver of evolution. Non-coding regions and/or &quot;baggage to be refactored&quot; (paraphrased great-great-gp comment) in DNA (the regions of the plain/beach not occupied by an advancing unit) can absorb &quot;errors&quot;. Also, there are other types of mutations (insertions, deletions, ...), aside from the single point mutations that this analogy was attempting to help convey.<p>The point is: it&#x27;s like bunching up a lot of important things over a few points of failure. If you increase &quot;the genetic surface area&quot;, you lower the chance of the important thing getting hit.<p>On evolutionary scales, viable DNA has been selected with a lot of non-coding (and sometimes useful) regions, we know that if we reduce that down, we are more likely to be susceptible to fatal mutations on coding regions (e.g. a region that codes for a vital protein).",1418464827

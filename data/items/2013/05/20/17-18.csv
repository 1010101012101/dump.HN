5738920,comment,5734680,5738732,1,0,VLM,,,"Its a hard science error propagation thing.  Look at your equation:<p>(In) - (out) = (delta aka gain/loss)<p>Some background is that both are about the same, it takes a decade or so to swing from anorexia to the worlds fattest man.  Lets say the (delta) represents a percentage of (In) / (Out) of perhaps 110% for a pregnant woman with quadruplets to maybe 99% very long term for an anorexic.<p>Watch the error propagation.  The order of the (delta) error percentage is roughly equal to the order of whichever error is bigger, in or out.<p>I claim the percentage error of (Out) greatly exceeds 10%.  Saying more than 50% makes me uncomfortable.  Probably the true value is well in excess of 25%.  This means any estimation or modification of (In) less than 25% is lost in the noise of the (Out) signal making the calculated delta meaningless.  Garbage in equals garbage out.<p>Very few people screw around with their diet on a long term average more than 25%.  Therefore any change they make will be lost in the noise of output energy level.<p>The way you get thin is by altering your diet so you are more active.  Some diets screw around with your blood sugar, insulin levels, inflammation levels, all that is going to screw around with energy out flow.  Large amounts of dairy products make me kinda queasy, so rather than going out for a walk or yard work, its sit on the couch.  Large amounts of protein make me feel pretty darn energetic so I walk about more.  Certainly the swing exceeds that experienced with having a cold vs being healthy.  For some people with gluten issues its probably more like having the flu vs being healthy.<p>The TLDR is (in)-(out)=(delta) is useless because you need to characterize (delta) to pretty high accuracy to even figure out if your gaining or losing, and outside of a medical facility under observation you cannot characterize (out) accurately enough, or frankly, probably not characterize (in) well enough either unless you stick to industrially produced hyper consistent super processed foods, like all TV dinners every day, or always and only fast food or vending machines.<p>Rats on a treadmill hooked up to a timer with analytical balance measured food intake and no free will WRT activity, yes that equation could have low enough error bars on both (in) and (out) to be usefully applied to get a realistic value for (delta).  Average american diet and lifestyle?  Naw all you're going to get as an output is a white noise source, on a medium term large population average anyway.<p>(Ah I edit in this ""real world-ish"" example.  Lets say skinny 20 yr old dude turns into fat 30 year old dude and he burns about 3000 calories per day to make the math easy.  That means he averages a mere 103% of his perfect ratio of (In) vs (Out) where 100% would have resulted in no gain or loss over a decade.  I theorize the error bars on (In) exceed three percent unless under constant medical supervision (every apple you ever ate was within 3% of spec?  Really?) and the error bars on (Out) exceed twenty five percent, so the delta is meaningless WRT getting this dude either fat or thin.  What does work is if his diet makes him sleepy / lazy / queasy / slow / blood sugar high or crash / whatever that screws up his (Out) enough to make him fat.  And any change in (Out) is going to be more effective than any change in (In).  So eat what makes you healthy, as long as you define healthy as ""active"" not necessarily classical stereotypical exercising)",1369072187

This is when you bring someone in for longer term engagements, or potentially when you hire someone to work on this full time.<p>I think you are hitting on something that is really a need in the market right now.  When you don't need a consultant, and you need 30-90 minutes of ""how do I do this?"" Q&A, it is hard to figure out who to talk to.<p>From my perspective, it is hard to find those engagements.  I do a sad majority of my time in the sales side of things.  Recently, I spoke to some folks at 10xmanagement and Adrian pointed me to anyfu, both of which are approaching this problem but in slightly different manners.<p>Lastly, you don't want the soup to nuts guy.  This is your app, and if you aren't deeply involved with what is going on with it, you are putting yourself at a huge disadvantage post consulting engagement.",1369071474
5738849,comment,5737879,5738728,2,0,jwarren,,,"Sorry, maybe I wasn't clear enough there. I feel that the way you construct an array and pass it to WP_Query is clear and easy to use.<p>Here's a random example from that docs page:<p><pre><code>    $args = array(\n     'post_type' => 'my_custom_post_type',\n     'meta_key' => 'age',\n     'orderby' => 'meta_value_num',\n     'order' => 'ASC',\n     'meta_query' => array(\n         array(\n             'key' => 'age',\n             'value' => array(3, 4),\n             'compare' => 'IN',\n         )\n     )\n    );\n    $query = new WP_Query($args);\n</code></pre>\nSo it's returning posts that:<p>- Are of the post type: ""my_custom_post_type"",<p>- That contain a custom field with the key of ""age"",<p>- That are in ascending order by the value of the aforementioned custom field,<p>- Where the ""age"" field is equal to either 3 or 4.<p>That seems relatively easy and straightforward to me.<p>The bit that you brought up is the loop, which is the canonical way of displaying the posts retrieved by a query. You don't have to, of course, you can just get an array of them and <i>foreach</i> your way through. The abstraction does allow for quick, easy, and relatively flexible development. I'd fully believe that it's messy on the backend, but that honestly doesn't normally affect my day-to-day usage.<p>Now, I'm not about to argue the merits of the core architecture of Wordpress - that's beyond my expertise. But I use it daily for client work, and it works very well for my needs.",1369071461

5738747,comment,5733290,5736575,2,0,betterunix,,,"""at this point, what kind of attacker can muster up that much computing power?""<p>There is already a single mining pool that nearly controls that much computing power.  In general, though, it is a bad idea to ask these sorts of questions; what is really important is not ""who might amass this much power"" but rather, ""what will the honest users do about it?""  In the case of Bitcoin, once an attacker amasses enough computing power for the attack, the honest users would have to increase their own computing power to prevent the attack -- but the attacker would only have to add as much to their own computing power as the honest users add to theirs.<p>By comparison, Mixmaster uses 1024 bit public keys.  Suppose someone amassed enough computing power to compute the corresponding secret keys, thus breaking the security of Mixmaster.  Without adding any additional worker nodes, Mixmaster could be updated to use 2048 bit keys, or 4096 bit keys, or even larger keys.  This would result in an exponential increase in the work needed to attack the system, at the cost of only a small increase in the work needed to run Mixmaster (small to the point of probably not requiring any new hardware).<p>""Not only that, but their motive must be not just to make gains. They would have to want to destroy the bitcoin economy.""<p>I would also be wary of trying to guess an attacker's motives.  The attacker may only be interesting in blocking confirmations on transactions involving a specific party (e.g. maybe the US government wants to prevent Wikileaks from receiving donations).  The attacker may have some goal that we cannot even imagine without knowing the attacker's particular circumstances.<p>""Interestingly, the bitcoin economy has already survived a 24-block split without major calamity[1].""<p>Yes, but that incident was (apparently) accidental.  The fact that such a thing can <i>accidentally</i> happen is pretty bad news.  To borrow Bruce Schneier's analogy, a house can <i>accidentally</i> burn down; an arsonist will <i>maliciously</i> cause that to happen, and will do so in the worst way possible.  An attacker will try to <i>trigger</i> such a fork, whether by spending a large amount of computing time or by exploiting some implementation bug (e.g. maybe the attacker will do only slightly more work than other miners, searching for that one block that triggers a subtle bug in some version of Bitcoin).<p>Compare this to a secure multiparty computation system in the malicious model.  In such a system, a node cannot <i>accidentally</i> break a security property -- because <i>no</i> node can deviate from the protocol in a way that breaks the security property.<p>""the Danish Beet Auction paper actually doesn't seem too far from the Bitcoin whitepaper""<p>There are a few key differences:<p>1. The security model is precisely defined:  the adversary corrupts a minority of the worker nodes, any number of clients, and no node will deviate from the protocol.<p>2. While the security model is weak, the authors (a) acknowledge that it is weak, (b) give a justification for choosing a weak security model, and (c) explain how to strengthen the security model and what the trade-offs would be.<p>3. There is a formal proof of security, which rules out all polynomial time attacks within the security model.<p>The Bitcoin paper has none of the above.  There is no clear security model, no justification for accepting the attack described in the paper itself, and no evidence that other attacks do not exist.  The paper does not spend any time considering an attack conducted by some colluding subset of nodes, not even to explain why such an attack is unlikely or will not be considered.<p>""Amateur or not, bitcoin may be the ""worse is better""[2] solution to low transaction fee, decentralized, online payments.""<p>Perhaps, but so what?  The point was that Bitcoin was almost certainly not designed by a mathematics or cryptography researcher.  Amateurs can certainly create systems that become popular.  The Linux kernel was originally written by an amateur; if this were 1993 and someone tried to tell you that Ken Thompson was behind the Linux kernel, would you have believed it?",1369070256

I use it to ensure a repeatable, self-documented machine setup, but then if I'm on AWS I snapshot an AMI for quick scaling. This also lets you more easily use Amazon auto-scaling tools like Cloud Formation, which bring up new machines based on an AMI. But having the Chef script is still great for knowing what's on your box and having ""source code"" to change it.<p>One thing I'm curious about re the OP's process: he says he is using Fabric for deploys. Does that mean every time he deploys new code he has to snapshot a new AMI? In that case, why use Fabric at all? I'd be worried about auto-deloying AMIs with outdated code.<p>Since EC2 instances are ""disposable,"" one approach is to never ""update"" an instance, but instead you release new code by simply launching fresh instances with the latest code, then destroying the old ones.",1369069871

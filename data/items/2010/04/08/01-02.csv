If you get a flippant maintainer of, say, a component of Windows, you're just going to have wait until one of his bosses decides a given bug is a large enough threat to the company to demand it gets fixed. This can be a very, very long time, especially where only edge cases are affected, where you have no option to do anything but beg someone to listen to you.

1248864,comment,1247489,1248768,0,0,chime,,,"Thanks for your commentary. This is exactly why I feel it is such a good thing to share one's ideas openly. I agree these are not concrete ideas - they are more of a reminder for me next time I'm looking for a project. E.g. ""sound-gen in flash"" is basically to remind me that it is now possible to synthesize audio in Flash dynamically. You can fill an array with 44,100 bytes (0-255) and it will play that for one second. This would be a very logical extension of my research project: <a href=""http://chir.ag/493"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/493</a> and <a href=""http://chir.ag/493/water/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chir.ag/493/water/</a> that was done using a Java Applet. I figure Flash work pretty well for stuff like this too.<p>I have absolutely no problems with anyone else making these apps or buying the domain names including screenshotnow.com. In fact I expect others to either make these apps or completely obsolete them by making other things that work even better. I move things down to the 'baked' section once I find something has been already made well. E.g. I wanted to make an equation solver/calculator-creator using JSMath. It would let anyone with very basic math skills to create say, a mortgage calculator using simple formulas. Then anyone could fill in the variables to get the answer. And you could share your calculators with others. One day I found this: <a href=""http://my.instacalc.com/calc/429c5824467344b29f3dbdb57c584983"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.instacalc.com/calc/429c5824467344b29f3dbdb57c58498...</a> and it does almost exactly what I wanted to do (though I would have a different/nicer UI).",1270688933

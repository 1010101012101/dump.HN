1032351,comment,1032306,1032339,0,0,edd,,,"I think this would be much less of a 'big deal' if you could 'suspend' more apps. Getting a txt during a game leaving the game to reply to it and then coming back and not being able to pick up where you left of does suck. If it could effectively sleep the app and pick it up again properly this would essentially remove any need for background apps for me. I do know Tweetie 2 has implemented this and it rocks.",1262699801

This is not surprising to anyone who works in embedded, but for those of my programmer friends who just see the hardware and have no clue just how much software is under the hood, it always seems to be a big shock to them that I have had to spend a few weeks fixing a hardware design that had one pin wired around the wrong way, instead of just getting the hardware fixed.<p>That said, one of the things I really like to see these days is new generations of extremely competent hardware designers who have absolutely no problems with the expenses of hardware iterations .. even though it means less work for me in the end, its good to see.

Right now, in one of my applications, I can't rely on Postgres doing the sorting, forcing me to retrieve all rows and sort on the client side which is a) annoying and b) anything but fast.<p>But whereas earlier, we had to set LC_COLLATE at initdb-time, now we can do it at createdb time and who knows - maybe we can do it at create index time in the future?

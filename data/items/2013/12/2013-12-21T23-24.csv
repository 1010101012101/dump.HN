You don&#x27;t just go in a slum and randomly pick somebody (if you do, I admire you, but you&#x27;re not the average). That access itself is based on a lot of other factors that have nothing to do with economics, and the rules for that access vary greatly accross India.",1387670350

Hashtagging relevant and milestone project emails into a central team access hub or a Sharepoint for Emails. This enable project progression tracking as oppose to creating a separate project log typically with Excel.<p>3) Work - Replaces overwhelming, unnecessary or less-critical CC&#x27;ed emails. Instead, invite users onto a Hashtag thread for them to read at their own time.<p>4) Search - Existing Search features are inadequate. Really requires the user to remember the content/context of the email before search can begin.<p>5) Sharepoint - Mostly use as storing files. Lacks files context and project description.<p>==<p>Experience:<p>- Organizing through hashtag in the email content is a more fluent experience than reorganizing your emails into folders, which is only for personal view, and not team based.<p>- Max numbers of hashtags in emails can be set.<p>- New social rules would be created that I cannot control. Within a professional setting, if employees are using hashtags in excess, they would be flown upon.<p>==<p>Testing Assumption:<p>- Market would be focusing largely on professionals and will also have an Enterprise-dedicated product.<p>- Hashtag currently associates with entertainment. Social fear of it in professional communications.<p>- Frequency of use. Crux of inbox overload from massive unnecessary emails.

6948606,comment,6948506,6948506,1,0,pachydermic,,,"At first, I was shocked by how poorly researched this article was. Then I read who wrote it - it&#x27;s just some random guy&#x27;s opinion (like me - or most likely, you). I don&#x27;t really think that his opinion is one that matters more than any one of random &quot;normal&quot; people.<p>I&#x27;m open to criticisms of capitalism (although I think that the use of that term - especially as it relates to the world&#x27;s <i>actual</i> economy - is highly exaggerated) and I think that there should obviously be some soul searching when you are beset by a near meltdown on one hand and what looks like growing inequality (at least in certain parts of the world) on the other.<p>But I think this guy has a fundamentally flawed vision about how stuff works and what the cause of the crisis was. It wasn&#x27;t monopoly - there are a <i>large</i> number of <i>international</i> organizations (investment banks, commercial banks, and freaking insurance companies) who were all blind-sided by the same obvious bubble. Bubbles aren&#x27;t rare - anyone in SF could probably attest to that. And what goes on in a bubble is that the markets break down and don&#x27;t price things correctly. That&#x27;s really all it is - and that&#x27;s all that markets are designed to do. And there&#x27;s no room in morality for markets - it&#x27;s just about finding the right price for stuff.<p>There&#x27;s plenty of morality involved in our government. In trying to help people who need help. But deciding what the market clearing price for corn is should be left to the market because when you interfere with that mechanism, you run the risk of making things worse. There&#x27;s a place for regulation - it should keep people sane and playing fairly - or in other words, should make sure that the market is healthy and doing it&#x27;s job. I&#x27;m definitely not saying that we should live in a dog-eat-dog world.<p>So my point is just that there are two things going on here, and the author doesn&#x27;t do an honest or good job of separating them. There&#x27;s the market mechanism for determining prices and there&#x27;s the fact that we aren&#x27;t spending on schools or social programs and, at least in the US, throwing large numbers of black kids in jail for the same shit that white kids do (but usually don&#x27;t get punished for). There are a million and one reasons why people are being left out and hurting... but I don&#x27;t think that determining prices through the market is one of them. And I certainly don&#x27;t think that morality has any role to play in cold hard calculations of price.<p>Just my 2 cents, obviously. Maybe I misunderstood the guy, but I&#x27;ll read your comments and try to avoid shouting matches.",1387669535

It&#x27;s quite possible to speculate in dogecoin (relying on greater fools coming after) in the short term and make some money. In the long term it is extremely unlikely to have any value at all, so if you take investment to be long term search for value, the answer to <i>should I invest</i> is no.<p>The interesting thing about fiat (all our currencies at this point, including crypto ones, unless you want to quibble over semantics), is that it depends on <i>confidence</i> for its value. Without confidence it is worth nothing (Assignats, Zimbabwean dollars etc). This realisation doesn&#x27;t give me great confidence in Bitcoin or any of its spin-offs though. It&#x27;s an interesting experiment and noteworthy, but I think fatally flawed as a currency or an investment because of the explicit rejection of verified identity, regulation, and inflation and its attempts to emulate paper cash.<p>Perhaps the next currency to emerge will be corporate sponsored rather than state-sponsored, as corporations are still rising in power over states, but it will be a very interesting century, because most of the national currencies probably won&#x27;t survive it, and by 2100, no-one will be using physical tokens for payments (cash).

What happens when a user upgrades their phone? Or loses it? Since the OP has basically admitted they&#x27;ll fall back on logins at some point, I think they&#x27;re going to have a much harder time explaining to users that they need to add an email address later in the process (or worse, try to retrieve someone&#x27;s data when it&#x27;s too late). On the other hand, it is interesting to think that maybe there is a decent strategy here, where you gracefully migrate an app user without a login (high conversion) into identifiable user (lower conversion).",1425484767
9145059,comment,9143570,9143570,0,0,joshuaheard,,,"As a lawyer, I am always excited to see innovation in the legal space.  This seems like an interesting concept: using an algorithm to summarize a document (contract) and to flag unusual clauses. Put the document in, and out comes the legal blessing.<p>However, I am a little concerned about the viability of this concept in terms of producing a valuable analysis.  A true analysis considers the context of a document.  For instance, a one-year term is a common residential lease clause.  However, what if the tenant was under a 6 month employment contract and needed to change locations?  The algorithm would not know this and would not flag the clause.  Or what if the tenant was 17 years old and couldn&#x27;t legally sign contracts in the first place?<p>Sometimes interpretation of a contract comes down to the exact wording of a contract.  Most boilerplate language is the result of years of evolution and precedent.  A summary might subtly change or obscure the meaning.<p>Finally, you are getting very close, if not into, the unauthorized practice of law.  I recommend contacting your state bar association for feedback.<p>That being said, I input my email address into your website and look forward to monitoring your progress.",1425484764

Admittedly the people being taught are fellow academics not freshmen, but still...<p>Finally you could survive in a tenured job with no motivation to be leaders, but given the overproduction of PHDs ranges from merely 10x to as much as 1000x as many as necessary in some liberal arts, the odds of a slacker being hired when only the top 1% can get a tenure track prof job are extremely low, so there is that selection bias against slackers indicating very few profs will be slackers.",1425484744

9144991,comment,9143570,9143570,0,0,uiri,,,"I feel like this would be great from employment contracts and nondisclosure agreements where the asymmetry of the situation is rather large and, depending on the company, the contract may actually be long enough to warrant a professional analysis. Of course, collecting multiple contracts from the same employer would help with pointing out what is actually unusual/normal (for that particular employer).<p>Residential leases seems like one of the worst contract markets to start off with. Firstly, because what is legal and illegal to put in a lease varies from place to place. For instance, in Ontario, it is illegal to collect a security deposit (a deposit may be collected but it can only be used towards last month&#x27;s rent). Secondly, what is normal and what is unusual will also vary, most likely on a much finer grained level (ie: by city/town rather than by state/province). Thirdly, you&#x27;ll have to deal with leases from less-than-professional landlords (e.g. using a lease drafted according to the rather different laws of a different province/state). Fourthly, the lease will vary a lot depending on the landlord (ie: large property management company vs small property manager vs individual owner-landlord) and the accomodations (ie: house vs condo vs apartment).<p>Lastly, few residential leases need to be more than about 5 pages long, including all the things the landlord has added over the years after being burned by various bad tenants. If there is a problem, the landlord and tenant will either resolve it or: if the landlord wants the tenant to move out, either it is easy to evict or it is difficult to evict but nothing in the lease will change that that much and if the tenant wants to move out, they will break the lease and good luck to the landlord suing the tenant trying to get the money back (the tenant risks very little by breaking the lease if they are not going to rely on the current landlord as a reference for future landlords). I doubt there is a special clause which can be put into a residential lease which will make it more difficult for the tenant to break it.<p>Then again, I rarely find legalese which I can&#x27;t parse (although sometimes it seems written in such a way that it will take me a full five minutes) so perhaps I&#x27;m not in the target market for this kind of service.",1425484398

I&#x27;d like to underline here that this kind of parenting is very different from the one shown in a recent post about some 11yo kids watching Alien at home [1].<p>Watching horror movies is safe for the body, and not recommended for the emotional brain [2]. Exact opposite of these wild playgrounds.<p>1. <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9127761"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9127761</a><p>2. Why? It seems obvious to me. Seeing very frightening or disgusting things in movies may make you overreact when facing similar disgusts in real life, or being too easily afraid. After seeing a horror movie as a kid you are afraid of monsters below your bed, afraid of darkness which may have monsters or ghosts. This is not the kind of fear that is even slightly useful. I suppose most of the ghosts stories of the past were actually useful: they prevented kids and adults from going out in the night, where they could be endangered for real. But nowadays no wolves haunt the nights anymore. It may be rational to induce a little bit of fear for cars when walking, so kids keep at safe distance. But I see no reason to raise the fears of the unknown and foreign as done in most horror movie.<p>Another example is food: fear your plate and you&#x27;re stomack will be in despair and show (either anorexia or obesity), trust your plate and you&#x27;re stomack will do it&#x27;s work properly: which is to keep you in normal shape.

9144821,comment,9144050,9144050,0,0,peterjmag,,,"A few first impressions:<p>1. Why oh why must we always shove everything into modal dialogs? In the &quot;old&quot; interface, each contact had its own separate page and individual URL. Now that every contact is a &quot;card&quot; that appears as a modal dialog, I can no longer link to it directly, and any card that I&#x27;m viewing is lost as soon as I close the tab or navigate away from the page. (Note that I don&#x27;t necessarily believe that every possible application state should be represented by a URL, but something as discrete as a single contact seems pretty important to me.)<p>2. The JS captures my Cmd-F / Ctrl-F shortcut and focuses the search bar in the header. To me, this is a huge no-no. Sometimes I just want to find some regular text on a page, not send my every keystroke to Google via a search box that gives me &quot;helpful&quot; page suggestions from Google+.<p>EDIT: Just noticed that you can still access the browser&#x27;s built-in search by hitting Cmd-F twice. A bit odd, but at least it&#x27;s not completely overridden.<p>3. The show-checkbox-on-hover behavior[1] in the list looks like something&#x27;s broken. It also doesn&#x27;t look like a checkbox until you actually click on it[2], which kind of defeats the purpose of a checkbox.<p>[1] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/f3AVYdv.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/f3AVYdv.png</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://i.imgur.com/aY5fPl7.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/aY5fPl7.png</a><p>I don&#x27;t mean to be super negative.

This and competition gradually edge each down.<p>Still, it takes one company of note to make that big move and the rest end up following in the same direction.<p>But today it is not all about having great tools, it is about users knowing how to use those tools that drive demand and establish standards.<p>As for Steam, well, most games will also be sold upon there store, so win win.<p>Either way, maybe schools can now expose students in tools that are not just for games but have users and functionality that transcend many fields from modeling, CAD like mock up&#x27;s and a level of detail and control a bit more than the popular Minecraft, which is in many ways a much simpler form of what these game-engines are today.<p>So demand is there and opportunity as well.  Be interesting how this pans out for game prices long term.  As with anything, when supply at a comparable quality hits a level then the only way to stand out is price and lower running costs to get started and investment.  Impact upon established studio&#x27;s could be interesting, if anything it makes what they do more competitive and beyond franchise work, which your cheap startup is not going to be grabbing, then not much will make them stand-out if they stay as is.  I see many opportunities for consultancy work and also a increase in the talent pool.  Solely due to increased numbers of people able to learn the tools and sue them.<p>As for which one becomes a standard, well, once we settle down  upon one operating system for everything is when such matters are close, but far from today on so many levels that there will always be competition for a long time to come.",1425483354

Not sure how I missed that tbh.<p>2. The word &quot;openloopz&quot; was coined about 7 years ago when I first started working on this &quot;project&quot; and &#x27;z&#x27; was kinda cool back then ;-)  The project has changed a lot since then but the name became quite close to me and I put a lot of work into the assets, so I stuck with it. I have considered changing it to Loop and would love to do that, but it would be a lot of work and I was focused on getting something out there as quickly as possible.<p>3. The welcome page is a work in progress.  I originally had something more detailed with LOADS of screenshots and features, even a video with my own voice (eugh!).   But I was advised to focus on why customers would want to use the product as opposed to focusing on features, and all the content became obsolete when I changed the look and feel.  Anyway, I will take all the comments on board and revise the landing page - I agree it could be a lot better.<p>Still reading... will respond to individual feedback separately.",1425483306
9144812,comment,9143167,9143167,0,0,bane,,,"When I was very young 6-8, I lived in a low-end, but rather large, apartment complex. It was built at the tail end of the brutalism architectural fad and we had oddities like fully concrete playgrounds built on top of concrete walking surface, surrounded by concrete planters with hard sharp corners.<p>There was a more conventional playground at an adjacent park and then a neighboring section of townhouses with an open field up at a higher elevation, and then by a strip mall on the other side. The whole area was maybe 2km x 1km.<p>The entire area was boxed in by 2 high-speed roads and on the other side a crazy intersection. So it formed a kind of &quot;natural&quot; range for us.<p>It was in the middle of a city so it wasn&#x27;t too big of a deal for my friends and I to run around all over the complex (there were three different concrete playgrounds and a pool), go over to each other&#x27;s apartments, run over to the park, play around in the parking garage. Run over to the local computer store. Nobody&#x27;s parents really seemed to care too much where we went inside of this box so long as we were home by dark.<p>There was a 7-11 across one of the busy streets with a couple arcade games and they sold comic books and baseball cards, so the braver of us would head over there on occasion and spend our meager allowances on that stuff. It was at about here I learned that different houses had different allowances on our range. Some kids would get in trouble if they came back toting comic books or candy that could have only come from the 7-11, some kids didn&#x27;t. And so by consensus us kids learned where was the furthest from home we could safely stray.<p>While most of my friends had a mother at home, I was fully latchkey, both of my parents worked, often till quite late. There was some strangeness in how this was managed:<p>- During the school year, between getting home from school and dark, I was free to go anywhere in this box I wanted, so long as I called my parents when I got home from school.<p>- If I was going to a friend&#x27;s apartment, I had to let them know this. If I was just going to play outside it didn&#x27;t matter where I went.<p>- During the summer, my mother would hire a local mother to be my babysitter. Her sons and I were already friends, and their house rules were more or less the same as mine. So really we&#x27;d just come home for lunch and she wouldn&#x27;t see us all day after that. But at least there was a &quot;responsible adult in charge&quot;<p>- There was an apartment rule that if you wanted to use the pool, and were under 12, you needed a responsible child 12 or older to bring you.<p>- If my parents decided to go out to a function by themselves at night, they&#x27;d hire in a babysitter, usually a local teen, I&#x27;d spend most of the evening outside with my friends, but within eyeshot of my house.<p>- Once it got dark, I had to report back in at home, then I was free to go back outside so long as it was within eyeshot/holler distance from home.<p>It seemed awesome at the time and I completely enjoyed growing up there. After this, we moved to the country, and strangely it seemed my range shrunk as there simply wasn&#x27;t really any place to go so it wasn&#x27;t much worth getting out of the house for. I had a couple friends that were within a couple miles, and on occasion I&#x27;d walk to their houses or they would walk to mine, but that was it, for the most part my world shrunk.<p>I learned much later that there was a darker side to all this childhood freedom.<p>- A known sex predator lived in our complex. My mother found out years later that many of my play friends had been abused by him. I believe one time he may have tried to get me to come to his apartment as I remember meeting a strange man at the neighboring strip mall who &quot;wanted to buy my bike for $1000, but I had to come back to his apartment to get the money&quot; The police never investigated any of the cases, and I rarely remember ever seeing police in the area.<p>- The tall apartment buildings were popular spots for suicides. I think I remember at least knowing about 3 or 4 suicides while I lived there. I know that one of the bodies was found by one of my play friends. It was so traumatic that he was pulled out of school and the family moved away.<p>- The brutalist design and the underground parking garage were extremely dangerous. Several of my play friends ended up in the hospital with broken bones and concussions from falling off of things or getting clipped by cars.<p>A couple years ago I went back to see my old stomping grounds. Of course it was much smaller as an adult than as an 8 year old.<p>- All of the playgrounds had been removed.<p>- A fountain feature had also been removed.<p>- Many of the concrete planters had also been torn up.<p>- A high fence had been put up around the pool.<p>- Some of the &quot;secret&quot; entrances into weird structural parts of the underground garage had been fenced over.<p>- The walking path to the neighboring strip mall had been removed and replaced with another high-speed road (shrinking the safe play range).<p>- The path to neighboring neighborhood had been completely removed. Shrinking the range more.<p>There were other bits of &quot;civilizing&quot; that had occurred, but it seemed like a less interesting place overall.<p>I don&#x27;t have any kids, but I&#x27;m mixed on allowing them the measure of freedom I had. There were many instances I can think of where we had gotten ourselves into real danger, and only by dumb luck did nobody get hurt. Parents who&#x27;s kids did end up in the ER very quickly put restrictions on their kids. On the flip side, it was incredibly enriching to have my world be my playground. To see or know about a place I could walk or bike to, and simply go there without any interference.<p>However, these days, I lament that there&#x27;s a bus stop outside of my house, that picks up high school kids, and takes them to a school a half-mile down the road. I would definitely let my kid walk to school instead.",1425483291

Lets say you make a game that sells $100,000 on steam. That&#x27;s pretty impressive. What&#x27;s your take home then?<p>Steam takes 30%, taxes take 20%, engine takes 5%, marketing costs take 10%, etc. Now you have $35,000 left. Even in the best case scenario of a solitary indie developer that&#x27;s a piss poor wage for someone who can make a game in a year that sells six figures on steam. Every little bit helps.<p>Now compare that to a game that sells $20,000,000.  That&#x27;s what, 7 million take home? That&#x27;s 200x the take home pay, yet it doesn&#x27;t take 200x the staff or 200x the time or 200x the cost to make it.  The system is geared for big shops.

That&#x27;s no reason to not advocate for improving the many many things that can be improved, but I find the widespread sense of deep foreboding completely maddening, and more useful for fostering division than improvement.<p>To continue with your specific example, people I talk to seem largely unaware that the economy of the US has pretty much recovered from the crash. A lot of times this unawareness manifests in the thought that everything we&#x27;ve done since then and are still doing has been utterly and catastrophically wrong and we need to scrap it entirely and figure something else out. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s very useful. The other perspective is to say, that&#x27;s great that the high level economic indicators have improved, but shouldn&#x27;t we be seeing wage growth along with it? How can we tweak the system to see the gains spread more equitably? That is, it&#x27;s not totally wrong, but it&#x27;s not totally right either. What can we do to get closer to &quot;totally right&quot;? That&#x27;s the sort of rhetoric I&#x27;d prefer to hear.",1425482619

You&#x27;re probably better off using something like UDP for that, though, instead of an HTTP request over TCP/IP.<p>Let&#x27;s take images. Translation factor:<p><pre><code>    worzworts -> image (identity)\n    flubbleize -> encode to jpeg (non destructive manipulation)\n    mrefgle -> encode to png (non destructive manipulation)\n    chezzle -> execute image as a Piet program and return the output (derived value that is not necessarily of the same type)\n</code></pre>\nNow, it&#x27;s think through it a little.<p><pre><code>    POST /image/ <http://imgur.com/8XA9Eva> => 1\n\n    GET /image/1 -> identical response (except some http headers) to the imgur URL\n\n    GET /image/1/piet -> &quot;Piet&quot;\n\n    GET /image/1/jpeg -> /image/1 re-encoded as a jpeg\n</code></pre>\nAll good here. But let&#x27;s look at some of the operations you suggest might be used, and the action they take:<p><pre><code>    POST /image/1/jpeg -> re-encodes the gif as a jpeg and saves it to /image/1; does not conform to REST best practices because POST is for creating new records -- immediately the developer is confused\n\n    GET /image/1/piet -> <unknown, I do not have a Piet runtime> because jpeg encoding is lossy, it fundamentally changes the data source at /image/1 with an arbitrary filter; in this case, JPEG compression.\n</code></pre>\nFunky undefined behavior, and it may not have the side effects intended. Now let&#x27;s see how it would work RESTfully:<p><pre><code>    GET /image/1/jpeg -> returns a jpeg encoding of /image/1\n\n    POST /image/ <response from /image/1/jpeg> -> 200 OK, { id: 2 }\n\n    POST /image/ &quot;Piet&quot; -> Error 415 (images expect an image, not a string)\n\n    GET /image/2 -> returns jpeg encoding of /image/1\n\n    GET /image/1/piet -> &quot;Piet&quot;\n\n    PUT /image/2 <response from /image/1/png> -> 200 OK\n\n    GET /image/2/piet -> &quot;Piet&quot; (since png is a lossless encoding, Piet will perform the same on it)\n</code></pre>\nIf you conform your API to single responsibilities, you won&#x27;t confuse the consumers of it by transforming a data source in-place on their request.<p>Things go a little sideways, but not much, if these operations need parameters. But that&#x27;s why they&#x27;re query parameters and not a part of the url. I don&#x27;t think anyone would suggest that you create a URL like<p><pre><code>    /image/1/jpeg/width/640/height/480\n</code></pre>\nThat&#x27;s just silly. If you follow the single-resource-deep philosophy, though, anything after the ID is a resource that is derived from the resource residing at #ID. This URL might actually make a lot of sense:<p><pre><code>    /image/1/jpeg/resize/640x480\n</code></pre>\nBut then again, so would:<p><pre><code>    /image/1/resize/640x480/jpeg\n</code></pre>\nBut wait, there&#x27;s an even better way to define these ... and still be restful.<p><pre><code>    /image/1.jpeg, /image/1.png, /image/1.piet\n</code></pre>\nOops, that last one doesn&#x27;t work. Piet isn&#x27;t an image format, it&#x27;s the result of executing the image as a Piet program. So maybe that one works better as a URL segment:<p><pre><code>    /image/1.jpeg (image), /image/1.png (image), /image/1/piet (string)\n</code></pre>\nIn this case,<p><pre><code>    /image/1.jpeg?w=640&h=480\n</code></pre>\nmakes just as much sense as<p><pre><code>    /image/1.png?w=640&h=480\n</code></pre>\nBut since we know that instead of a transformed image, the image/:id/piet resource is a derived string based on image/:id, this URL totally doesn&#x27;t make sense - and neither should it! Should the image be resized before being executed? How exactly does one change the height of an ASCII string? Maybe you want an image of the ASCII string that has been resized? Ambiguous request! Undefined behavior!<p><pre><code>    /image/1/piet?w=640&480 -> 400, bad request.\n\n</code></pre>\nBut these same operations could be done on a video stream. POST creates a new video stream identifier; streaming source opens a websocket/webrtc/whatever based on that identifier; GET /stream/1/hls -> hls chunked stream of the incoming source video; GET /stream/1/dash -> DASH chunked stream of the incoming source video. Uh oh, source stream disconnects due to a network glitch. That&#x27;s okay, they can just re-open it with the same identifier. Source stream PUT <some kind of manifest> /stream/1 : notifies the server that it is complete, server can cease to accept new streaming inputs for /stream/1; GET /stream/1/hls now returns a 301 redirect to /video/1/hls, which contains the entirety of the video that was streamed, as the server received it.<p>Or do you have some other domain in mind that doesn&#x27;t involve flubber?",1425482293

The model for indirect, representative democracy is less exclusive, but the main ancient model is the Roman Republic.<p>> We solved this with newspapers, 100 years ago.<p>Newspapers are much older than 100 years old, and they don&#x27;t solve the problem of lack of time. Arguably, they increase the information assymetry between the ruling class and the ruled class, since it is generally the former that controls the papers and selects what goes in them -- and what does not. This is somewhat offset when different factions of the ruling class disagree on what to present, in that information from both factions is likely to be presented (often in different outlets), but that increases rather than reduces the time and skill of the population needed to ferret out the <i>correct</i> information.<p>> But, it would be too much paperwork to get the votes from millions of people.

Someone in the bay actually quit his job and began organizing an ngo around it after I had a conversation with him. Basically, you have the right to vote on everything, but you can also proxy your vote to someone else on any issue, category of issues, etc. You can always override a proxied vote, but you can find someone you trust, who is an expert, and let them vote for you. This allows for you to save time, but some people who really wanted to put time and effort in would get more votes proxied to them. Of course, if they proxy their vote to someone else, it would influence all the votes tied to them. You could see how voting blocs would emerge organically.",1425482184

9144670,comment,9142871,9142871,0,0,cryoshon,,,"I&#x27;ll piggyback onto this article with a few mistakes I made in the past.<p>1. Correcting the interviewer. In one of my interviews, an MD/PhD was explaining to me his experimental design, which involved training a cohort of people to do a task, then afterward subjecting that cohort to electrical brain stimulation while performing the task in order to compare results on the task. Concerned, I mentioned that the experiment wasn&#x27;t controlled for people merely becoming better at the task as they had more exposure to it. The person in charge didn&#x27;t approve of this, and perceived it as an attack on their experiment. Clearly, this was the point at which I &quot;lost&quot; the interview. Lesson: the interview isn&#x27;t the place to tear apart problematic projects.<p>2. Being honest with the interviewer. In another of my interviews, I was discussing various volunteering projects that I had undertaken. The woman who was interviewing me was old enough to be my mother, and seemed to be approving of my extensive list of volunteering opportunities, which she had inquired about. This lulled me into a false sense of security, leading me to disclose one of my volunteering projects which involved video-game-based mentorship of disadvantaged youth. This immediately raised her hackles, prompting her to ask if I &quot;played video games a lot&quot;. I said yes, being young and stupid, assuming it&#x27;d be absurd to hold something that I did in my private time against me. I &quot;lost&quot; the interview&quot; with that admission, even though I&#x27;d been golden up to that point. Lesson: the interview isn&#x27;t a place for anything other than pushing the interviewer&#x27;s buttons until you get exactly what you want.<p>3. Asking questions for which there is no feel good answer. In yet another interview, I started to get a whiff of desperation from the interviewers regarding workflow from manager to employee. I probed the issue, then asked directly, &quot;How is success measured here?&quot; suspecting that I&#x27;d get an answer like &quot;completed projects per week&quot; or something else which would come off as overly controlling to employees. I was told there was a quota based system. This turned me off immensely, and turned the interviewer off as well for having to admit such an embarrassing thing. I still got a job offer after this mistake, but I ended up rejecting it. Lesson: don&#x27;t embarrass the organization you&#x27;re interviewing for by making them admit weaknesses.<p>4. Permitting bad behavior from the interviewer. In three (3) separate interviews for different organizations, the interviewer arrived 10-15 minutes late with no apology. In the first of these interviews, the interviewer&#x27;s beeper went off, causing a flurry of cussing and an interruption of the interview for an extended phone call. This happened again later in the interview. I &quot;lost&quot; the interview because of the constant interruptions by the interviewer&#x27;s other commitments, and didn&#x27;t get the job-- maybe a bullet dodged here. In the second of the three late interviews, the interviewer notified me beforehand he&#x27;d have to stop in the middle in order to check his son&#x27;s scores, as his son was in some sort of sports competition at that moment. Sure enough, the interview was in a state of anti-flow due to his constant pausing and checking his son&#x27;s scores, at times cheering quietly. I &quot;lost&quot; this interview because of blatant disrespect-- maybe another bullet dodged. The final late interview was spared any interruptions, but was instead occupied by a bizarre egotistical rant based on the interviewer&#x27;s past accomplishments, detailing how the interviewer had presented his research to a crowd of many people and made a name for himself. This was irritating, but tolerable. Following his ego-trip, the interviewer then went on to compare me and the other (not present) candidates to his son, saying how his son was the ideal candidate and that everyone in my generation other than his son was extremely entitled and should really lower their expectations because of how hard he had it when he was coming up. I can&#x27;t make this shit up. I lost the interview when I failed to behave like his son. Lesson: don&#x27;t be afraid to stand up and walk out of an interview if the interviewer isn&#x27;t prepared to take you seriously.",1425482181

Oh look my ancient &#x27;97 Saturn really does accelerate at 120 horsepower as calculated based off 2nd derivative of position and input mass.  And, likewise, by continuous monitor of the stats and doing some very simple timing, torque can output 0-60, 0-100, quarter mile, etc, you hit reset, it waits until the throttle position sensor is slammed or it sees over 0 mph then times until it sees 60 or 100 or whatever.  I think it can do braking distance the same way although its been awhile since I tried.<p>Its interesting to watch the other readouts like coolant temperature.  How long does it REALLY take a car to warm up in the winter vs the summer and stuff like that.<p>I believe I have the same no-name adapter the author has, and it works well.

So on my wife&#x27;s prius if you download the special prius map file you can do deeper diagnosis and see the voltage across battery #11 or whatever which is moderately interesting, but without the map file it doesn&#x27;t know how to map the additional telemetry packets into individual cell voltages or whatever.

Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton&#x27;s $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.<p>The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton&#x27;s email server. The former president&#x27;s full name is William Jefferson Clinton.<p>In November 2012, without explanation, Clinton&#x27;s private email account was reconfigured to use Google&#x27;s servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google&#x27;s accusations in June 2011 that China&#x27;s government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.<p>Then, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton&#x27;s private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.</i>",1425481801

This is not to say that it has caused the populace to be less informed -that would be absurd- but it has not caused them to be particularly more informed either. 9/11 truthers and antivaxxers constitute some relatively non-controversial evidence for this claim; there are others that would invite non-productive flamewars if I listed them here.",1425481360

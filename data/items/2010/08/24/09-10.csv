1629371,comment,1629316,1629333,0,0,paraschopra,,,"If you need technical details, implementing it is quite simple. For generating screenshots on an Ubuntu machine, you just need a script called webkit2png.py <a href=""http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulhammond.org/webkit2png/</a> and XVFB (fake X server).<p>After that, taking screenshots is as simple as firing this command on shell:<p>xvfb-run --server-args=""-screen 0, 1024x768x24"" python webkit2png.py -o google.png -F javascript -w 2 <a href=""http://google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com/</a><p>Even though it is resource-intensive operation, I decided to generate screenshots on our own servers over using an existing service because I didn't find a satisfactory screenshot generation API that captures full-page screenshots (as opposed to just thumbnails).<p>Next feature is to implement nicely formatted PDF reports. But my initial research says it is a VERY hard task! (That's because VWO charts are all JavaScript powered)",1282643247

It's unreliable. Don't forget that it's not only your stuff that's running.<p>If you are on Dolby Digital, then there would be some kind of encoder running with you.<p>If you are doing multi-player game, then it could be that you are the one running the server (obviously made such way that no one else knows).<p>If you are running in different resolution - same applies - different timings.<p>If you are doing splitscreen - yup.. Another change<p>And if you want to do real 3D - one more....<p>And many more (HDD presence or not - e.g. caching on the HDD or not).<p>At the end of the day, you try to get 30fps or 60fps, and some other internal frame for the server (if multiplayer game). If you get that you are just fine.<p>No one relies on what you've just said.<p>That was done only on the really old machines, where you had to synchronize each horizontal scan line so you get some special effects (more colors, or more stuff being drawn).<p>Almost anything since 1996 is not like that.<p>Even the PS1 had different speeds, and it was TRC violation to rely on that, because Sony were smart and knew they had to emulate that in future, and exact proper emulation is not always easy.",1282643230

1629368,comment,1629139,1629139,0,0,Mz,,,"You might try looking at the stories behind Walmart and Habitat for Humanity.  My understanding:<p>Sam Walton wanted big time success.  His wife wanted to raise her kids in a small town.  He felt he needed to go to the big city to get big success but he loved his wife.  So he founded Walmart which was aimed at serving small towns.<p>Millard Fuller was a millionaire by age 30.  At some point after that, his wife told him she wasn't happy with their lives and wanted a divorce.  They had originally both been Christian and lived simpler lives and were happy at first and then it all became about the toys money could buy and she hated it.  He gave away all of his wealth to keep the woman he loved and then founded Habitat for Humanity so they could live out their Christian values.<p>I'm sure there are other true life stories out there that would be relevant.  Those are just two that come to mind off the top of my head.",1282643127

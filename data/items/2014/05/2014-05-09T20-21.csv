Or, the incumbent would die, leaving multiple companies to compete for the profitable business. Getting rid of the build-out requirement would open the field of competitors. As it stands, build-out requirements mean only big companies with large amounts of capital can enter a decently-sized market. Those companies want to make big returns. But as long as their is some profit to be made, small companies could come in and serve parts of the market that are ignored by the big companies.

7723220,comment,7721096,7721777,3,0,sqrt17,,,"Actually, it&#x27;s a bit more complicated: for small integers, the Python runtime has a stash of pre-made objects. For compiled code, the code may include a static reference to a constant object.<p>Which means that, if you execute &quot;a = 110&quot; a bunch of times, no new objects get created. If you execute &quot;a= 110+300&quot; a bunch of times, a whole bunch of new objects is created and destroyed.<p>By the way, this boxing/unboxing logic is also at work when you stick numbers into a standard HashMap, since it stores Integer objects and not the primitive type. However, in Java you can use GNU Trove&#x27;s IntObjectHashMap or ObjectIntHashMap and save some memory, whereas Python&#x27;s &quot;everything is an object&quot; rules this out (unless you&#x27;re using PyPy and its tracing jit which figures out that a always contains a number).",1399668924

If the government wants companies to build infrastructure in locations where it isn&#x27;t profitable then they should supply the money to do it rather than imposing a severe hidden tax on the locations where it is profitable and driving out investment.<p>But I still don&#x27;t see how competition is going to fix it. It&#x27;s obvious why a newcomer would want to enter a market where its incumbent competitors have build out requirements and it doesn&#x27;t -- it would have a cost advantage with which to bludgeon the incumbents.

Novelis Corp.</i>, a customer ended up essentially having to re-buy a half-million-dollar software license because it did a corporate reorganization that technically resulted in an &quot;assignment&quot; of the license without the consent of the vendor.  See <a href=""http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0346p-06.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/09a0346p-06.pdf</a><p>Conceivably the software vendor in this case might come to regret having taken such a hard line with its customer. That customer is highly unlikely ever to buy <i>anything</i> again from that vendor if there&#x27;s an even remotely-comparable alternative.<p>Of course, the vendor might be figuring that they&#x27;re not likely to make any additional sales from that customer anyway, so what the hell, squeeze out whatever additional money they can.<p>For a discussion of the legal principles and more examples, along with contract-clause language that can help customers avoid this problem, see <a href=""http://www.CommonDraft.org/#AssmtConsentAddlCmt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.CommonDraft.org/#AssmtConsentAddlCmt</a> and <a href=""http://www.CommonDraft.org/#AssmtConsentExceptAssetsCls"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.CommonDraft.org/#AssmtConsentExceptAssetsCls</a> (a side project of mine).<p>2.  In theory the judge in the <i>ABN</i> case might have been able to award the vendor ABN&#x27;s profits arising &quot;indirectly&quot; from the infringement --- which for bank-transaction software could have been considerable.  There is precedent for that:  In the 1980s, the MGM Grand Hotel was found liable for 2% of its hotel- and casino profits because its floor show had infringed the copyright in a Broadway musical, the Tony-award-winning <i>Kismet</i>.  See <a href=""http://www.oncontracts.com/a-better-way-to-handle-a-breach-of-contract-at-least-in-some-cases/#MGMGrand"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oncontracts.com/a-better-way-to-handle-a-breach-o...</a> for more details (a blog post I did a few years ago).<p>But in this case the judge apparently ruled that she was unable to compute the damages to which the vendor was entitled.",1399668432

The main compatibility issue would be Firefox, not the OS.<p>The operating systems and Web browsers meet the Web sites over the standards; if the standards are being met, then XP,\nWindows 7, Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc. just irrelevant.<p>I have a copy, new, quantity one, retail, sealed in the package, DVD of Windows 7 Professional on my bookshelf, but installing it would take DAYS and maybe WEEKS of work, considering all the re-installation of other software, when some of that other software ruined my installation and I had to start over, etc.<p>So far, there is no good reason for me to change operating systems.  Besides, there is considerable question if Windows 7 is an UPgrade instead or just the same or even a DOWNgrade.  Windows Vista and 8.0 were really DOWNgrades.  As far as I am concerned, since I don&#x27;t want to use a touch screen or the &#x27;Metro&#x27; interface, Windows 8.1 is a DOWNgrade into the sewer.<p>I will change to Windows 7 Professional and later Windows Server but hopefully never anything like Windows 8.x.<p>For now, for me, XP is fine.<p>Again, once again, over again, to be more clear, asd should be plenty clear at HN anyway, if recent versions of Firefox and Flash run on my OS, that should be sufficient.<p>For more, I am a heavy Internet and Web user, and as I stated, that music Web site is the worst I&#x27;ve seen.  What I described is just what happened.  When the Toccata played, the video was in a tiny window in the UR corner of the screen -- absurd.  Worst site I&#x27;ve seen.

It supports tags and search and is extremely fast at using either to find a bookmark.<p>I was really more interested in learning the code than the details of what I was building, but it turned out nice enough that I keep my bookmarks in it. It&#x27;s also open source, and you can easily host it yourself.

The site itself is really just a demo of the code.<p>The repo&#x27;s missing one element though, which is a screenshot generation service, because I honestly don&#x27;t remember the steps I went through to get PhantomJS (headless webkit) working.

C is not designed for maximum performance, but as a system language and as such only as slim abstraction over assembler. As a <i>side effect</i> it allows for maximum performance. A more fair comparison (pretty much every widely used language is easier to use than C) would be C++ vs. Python, where in C++ most - if not all - of the higher level abstractions were explicitly designed not to worsen performance compared to low level code. And in my opinion Python is so much easier to use than C++ because it values simplicity and consistency more than efficiency.<p>For example the general loop constructions in Python which are possible because of nice generators and the wonderfully straightforward `yield` construction are unacceptable in C++ as they lack the flexibility to be as efficient as possible in every case.<p>The advantage of dynamic typing only becomes apparent in a third argumentative step; when you try build a language with consistent and efficient abstraction and you end up with something like Haskell whose type system complexity is huge entry barrier. That&#x27;s why <i>I</i> think dynamic typing is good for Python.",1399667361

Most, if not all, integrated circuits are designed these days using a hardware description language (VHDL and Verilog being most popular) and those languages/files have exactly the same level of source code control that any source code does, git, mercurial, CVS, etc. They are just text files, they have a build and a test processes.<p>Further integrated circuits can be collaboratively designed, look at FPGACPU.org as an interesting example.<p>This one is really hard to wrap my head around:<p>CLAIM: There is an absurdly high level of unsalable designs.<p>EVIDENCE: This occurs because there&#x27;s no customer feedback loop and you can&#x27;t predict the direction of the IC market.<p>Bad chip designs exist for the same reason that bad software exists, some people just produce bad designs. I think you were trying to argue that there are good designs that didn&#x27;t get produced, but that is true for any design.<p>So that said lets talk about what <i>is</i> hard.<p>It is hard for me, as an individual, to get a wafer start at a fab. It is hard for me as an individual to <i>generate</i> masks for a specific process.<p>It is hard for me, as an individual, to get the circuit parameters for a particular process and so that I can do both a good layout and can tweak my masks for good yield.<p>It is hard for me, as an individual, to get my processed wafers diced, tested, and packaged.<p>Historically, getting all of those things done to convert a working chip design from simulation to testable parts, has been a few million dollars. And at the end of those millions one has (wafer size / die size ) * layout efficency * process yield * testing yield number of parts. These are divided up into one or more &#x27;bins&#x27; (if they are still usable at different frequencies or voltages). And when I divide that number of chips by the amount of money I&#x27;ve spent, I&#x27;ve got a price per chip that has to be something the market will be willing to pay.<p>That is both a lot of hoops, and sitting down for betting one round costs a few million.<p>So what, exactly, is efabless.com de-risking? Unlike circuit boards, you can&#x27;t easily put several different IC designs on the same chip and expect a fixed yield across them (sort of the OSHPark model). You can do what some folks have done which is buy &quot;excess&quot; capacity on older generation fabs (like Atmel&#x27;s) and get a discount because you&#x27;re helping them keep things running, but its still quite expensive.<p>The cost of failure in IC design is nearly zero. Once you&#x27;ve done the simulations you&#x27;ve just burned CPU cycles up to that point. If the process is <i>well characterized</i> there is exactly zero reason for a chip you produce to not work when it comes out the other end. A long time friend from my Intel days remarked that it used to be news if a chip worked the first time, now it is news if it <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> work the first time you bake it.<p>I can see a challenge that low run rate chips are too expensive for the market they are trying to serve (which is why FPGAs have been growing in leaps and bounds). The original solution, ASICs which are less space efficient than bespoke designs are great for taking an FPGA design into production. So the modern &quot;chip&quot; process has evolved to design it, ship your MVP on FPGAs, if you get sufficient traction you do a two or three metal layer ASIC, if you get even more traction you plug in the process design library and do layout for a specific process.

Seeing and hearing actual instruments helps to tease out the various lines of the music and make sense of it all. There isn&#x27;t any recording system that can capture a performance of a Mahler symphony (or the Schoenberg <i>Gurrelieder</i>). And a small intimate chamber concert is a lot of fun too, a shared experience with strangers. Concerts are programmed with an eye for contrast and coherence, and you can discover interesting pieces through unusual pairings.<p>Suggestion: as a contrast to the Goldberg and Bach&#x27;s world generally, try Schubert. A particular favourite of mine is the String Quintet (doubled cello) D. 956. The Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum provides a live concert recording[2].<p>Plea: To keep this music alive, can people please <i>buy</i> recordings by <i>living artists</i> now and again? Many here are mentioning Glen Gould&#x27;s Goldberg. Try Simone Dinnerstein&#x27;s recording (Telarc CD in Europe). Listen to Jeremy Denk&#x27;s realisation in a small concert setting (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum)[1] for nowt. All classical musicians working now are competing against 100 years of recordings!<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.gardnermuseum.org/music/listen/music_library?filter=artist#go_2488"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gardnermuseum.org/music/listen/music_library?filt...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.gardnermuseum.org/music/listen/music_library?filter=artist#go_2427"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gardnermuseum.org/music/listen/music_library?filt...</a>",1399665606

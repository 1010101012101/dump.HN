923505,comment,919808,921576,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"No, I haven't.  It's been some time since I've seen a halogen torchiere.  I would suspect the compact fluorescents  are dimmer and, depending on the bulb, less ""pure white"" in perception.  The Verilux compact fluorescent bulb I am currently using has a fairly ""cold"" tone, despite being advertised as ""Full Spectrum / Daylight Spectrum:.  I have an OTT ""Natural Light"" bulb and a GE ""daylight"" bulb (6500K) that I haven't tried, yet.<p>If nothing else works, I'd follow the recommendation of another commentor here and try an incandescent bulb that achieves a full spectrum effect via a rare earth element coating.  Note that GE has some incandescent bulbs whose glass has a blueish cast -- ""Reveal"", I believe they name them -- that are cheaper.  However, the Reveal bulbs do not achieve the same effect.<p>I have had such coated incandescent bulbs, of higher quality -- Chromalux is the brand name I seem to recall -- and was quite pleased with their appearance.  I did not use them in a torchiere, but they were in a flexible lamp twisted to shine up and provide indirect lighting off of the ceiling.<p>Maybe just get a candidate bulb first and see what you think.  Stick in in a desk lamp or similar and bounce the light off the ceiling.  It's higher power consumption, but you may just want to try the Chromalux first.<p>If this is fun, wait until we lose the incandescent bulbs...  ;-)  Sorry if my follow-up sounds less definitive than my original reply.",1257406681

923498,comment,923260,923260,0,0,kevinpet,,,"The title is correct, the article confused and somewhat pointless. NoSQL is about the systems, not the query language, but it's not about RDBMS minus atomicity and consistency, it's about saying ""this <i>not</i> SQL, don't compare it to RDBMS that you are used to querying with SQL"".<p>Anyone talking about how you can implement SQL on top of NoSQL systems is missing the point. KV and Document stores are a different way of storing data.<p>SQL: express what you want to happen using relational notation, and it will magically happen. There are no real-world performance issues.<p>NoSQL: certain operations are fast, other operations are slow. This fact is reflected in the API.",1257405700

I want to _use_ your _product_ which is supposed to replace Word.<p>There shouldn't be an 'easy' signup process, there should be _no_ signup process to use it. It's already easy - I could have entered my google info (apparently) if I wanted to. I don't want to link my google account to yet another service.<p>Make me sign up if I want to save something that I made. _THEN_ you know I'm interested enough in your product to overcome the hurdle.<p>The best analogy I can think of: right now you've got window shoppers that see interesting things inside. But you have someone standing at the door asking them to put their name on a sheet of paper before they come in the store, 'So we can better serve you.' How many people are likely to walk in the store? Of course SOME will, but a lot wont.<p>And my point with the ""random third"" is that it becomes a great way to figure out what the market is looking for. If you put up, say, CRM, and get 30% clickthrough, and you put up, say, discussions, and get 1% clickthrough, that's valuable data.<p>A small usability nit: someone else (odd) linked a 'try it' page.

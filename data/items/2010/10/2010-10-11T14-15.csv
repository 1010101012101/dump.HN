1779912,comment,1777553,1779729,0,0,lsc,,,"eh, the old car issue aside (I fail to see how working on older cars is easier than newer cars... quite the opposite, really.  the newer stuff is full of computerized diagnostics.  I mean, the computer won't solve all your problems, but good god, have you ever tried to rebuild a carburetor?  adjusting the 'richness' of your fuel air blend?  oh yes I like the computer, and the OBD system.) it really is a straight time for money play.  For the basic stuff, it's pretty easy to get to the point where it takes you as long as the mechanic will charge you for (most mechanics charge 'book rate' - e.g. how much time the book says a task will take rather than how much time it takes them.  It's not too difficult to get up to that speed.)<p>So really, for any given car, if you work on it yourself, you shouldn't be spending much more time than what the shop would charge you for the same work, and, uh, like I said, $90/hr post-tax isn't something most of us sneeze at.    (Of course, if you can sneeze at that, good for you!)<p>that said, right now I'm taking my vehicle to a professional.  the thing is, sure, the car only needs something once every 6 months, if you don't count oil changes (which I usually take in, just 'cause it's worth twenty bucks to not deal with the oil)  -  the thing is, where I am now, maintaining a garage would cost me more than just paying to take my car in.    So yeah, it doesn't always make sense.",1286809178

If your branch was to add a new widget to the UI, and there's a regression I'm trying to find in the backend data munging code, it's better if I can trivially ignore all the changes from the new-ui-widget branch, because I know that's very unlikely to have broken the data munging.

Well - unless you have a very specific reason [1] it seems to me that LFS is too much time invested for not enough return. As others commented, you can go a long way with a source based distribution. Learning a different distribution's way to do things might already be pretty interesting (and arguably more useful: You'll probably never hit a LFS system in real use that needs fixing, but you might stumble upon a solaris/freebsd machine or even just a heap of Suse/RedHat/Debian/Slackware machines) and challenging. Start with that!<p>LFS is a purely academic thing for me. You follow the guide, just to end up with a system that is really nothing for daily use (or - needs too much work).<p>All the above assumes that your definition of a linux poweruser is someone that understands the darkest secrets of the OS. Which - is not exactly necessary. I know plenty of users that I'd consider power users because they focus on things they actually need (and improve those, get better at those), not things that somehow make this possible.<p>Cue the car analogy:
A race driver would be a power user for me, I don't require that he can build a race car from scratch..<p>[1]: Some reasons I could imagine to change the answer to a yes:<p>1) You want to really build your own distribution for an embedded device and don't like openembedded<p>2) You are (or plan to) a system administrator and want to learn more underlying details for your job.<p>3) You plan to get into system-level programming/contribution and want to understand the status quo first.",1286808532

I agree with some of the comments below. The site needs to get to the Aha moment quicker for therapists. As you described yourself, patients often complete these exercises incorrectly. Helping therapists avoid that seems to be the real benefit here. The other things, like email , tracking patients etc are cool but they require work. SO the real benefit is the increased likely hood that patients will do their exercises correctly.<p>Another idea:
Have you considered licensing those videos out as standalone components. If you have rights maybe this could be another revenue stream. At least this way you could capture revenue from the offices that don't want to go through all the work of using the full app. And in the opposite direction - it may be a ice-breaker product.

Think of it as the minimal system required to get you up and running and nothing more. You will need to use BLFS or something else to get yourself to point where you will most likely be comfortable (especially as an Ubuntu user).<p>2) There is no package management by default. The manual recommends some ways to handle this including rebuilding the entire system from scratch (!) when you want to upgrade. So, after all of the work you do (which is mostly watching things compile) you are still responsible for maintaining all of your installed applications. For the average Linux system, this is <i>a lot</i> of packages.<p>3) All of that said, it is an interesting process to go through if you would like a little more insight into how a Linux system works, assuming that you take the time to understand what you are doing (and why) and not just blindly follow the manual.<p>Shortly after completing the project (completed over a weekend), I found that I had learned a lot but had no desire to maintain the system. I believe (don't quote me on this) that the creator of Arch Linux started from LFS.<p>In the end, I use Linux Mint. It's like Ubuntu with a better organized interface (IMHO) and more attention to visual detail.<p>Should you try LFS? Sure, why not? It won't kill you and maybe it will spur some new project or idea in you. Worst case scenario, you spend a few hours rebuilding a machine.<p>Hope this helps.",1286806777

That way, you’ll be able to see when you merged in what in the future because you have that merge commit I called “nasty” before. It isn’t, really.</i><p>I've come to prefer merges for this case.  It reflects reality - you really were developing on a separate history for a while, you're not interweaving bugfixes from master with feature work, etc.  And it visually (and logically) groups the commits for the feature, so it's very easy to review or revert the feature as a whole, instead of having to figure out exactly which commits in the big linear history are relevant (or having to religiously tag every time you do anything interesting).  The current git visualisation tools (gitk, gitg, gitx) aren't very good at displaying histories with interesting merge structures, but I confidently predict someone will release an awesome dotviz-based history visualiser soon which makes it easy to navigate forests of branches and merges.<p>That said, as the article describes, rebase does handle conflicts (syntactic and semantic) better than merge does.  Because it rebases a commit at a time, you have to think about how the upstream change affects each change that you made in the feature branch, which means you're much less likely to resolve the conflict in a way which breaks some subtle assumption you baked into the code two weeks ago.<p>I've sometimes taken the approach of first rebasing my feature branch onto the latest master to resolve any conflicts, and then doing a 'merge --no-ff' to explicitly create a merge commit to get the visual history marker.",1286805829

I was suggesting that there were a lot of repeat criticisms that we all know and hear all the time. 80% of the page are the same criticisms of syntax, keyword names, prefix notation, and structures. One could probably reduce the length of the page by a significant amount if they just replaced it all with a single <ul>.<p>The criticisms of Lisp are nothing new. The language has been around for a dogs age. There are going to be people who will never like parens or silly keywords like cons, car, and cdr. Personally I find it equally silly when they claim such superficial reasons are why Lisp is a terrible language. Every language has to deal with some amount of this weak argument. Lisp is no different, so I have no qualms with the argument itself.<p>If Lisp doesn't work for you, it doesn't work for you. It's no reason for ""hate"". :p",1286805779

Linux from scratch will mainly teach you (wait for it) how to build linux from scratch. Systems that are not quite ""from scratch"" but are lower level than Ubuntu (eg, Gentoo, Arch (others?)) will also teach you some of this. I used Gentoo for years, and after compiling about a dozen kernels in a row to get things to work how I wanted, I guess you could say I'd learned something, if only 'what kernel options I want to enable on this hardware'. :)<p>But building Linux won't really teach you to _use_ it. If you want to be a power user in the long run, your time (and LFS will take a _lot_ of time!) might be better spent learning your shell/package manager/scripting language of choice in greater depth, compiling your own kernels and adding them as options in grub/lifo, that sort of thing.<p>All that said, if the LFS process sounds really appealing to you, go for it. You'll definitely learn _something_, but just maybe not as much as you're hoping.",1286805717

Granted, this comes from people that have a fairly solid Linux background and typically run distros closer to LFS than Ubuntu (think Gentoo and the like), so depending on your back ground, your mileage may vary.<p>Personally, I'm still interested in taking some time to do it, and I've actually been trying to convince some friends of mine to spend a weekend, with each of getting a system hacked together. There appears to be lots of interest, but getting everyone to agree on a time might just be impossible. Perhaps I'll dig that project out of the closet this weekend and get it done myself...<p>In any case, if you're looking to understand Linux better, it will probably help, but I would suggest that there are probably better avenues for learning it. Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment will teach you all the subsystems you have to interact with (albeit, typically from a programming view), and Understanding the Linux Kernel will teach you the ins and outs of the kernel like nothing else. There may be better books out there for what you're looking for, but those two I have direct experience and would highly recommend.<p>On the other hand, if this is something you're interested in doing, shouldn't that be reason enough? You'll likely learn something on the journey, though it may not necessarily be Linux-related, and you'll be doing something you want to be doing.",1286805696

8770908,comment,8769925,8770640,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>It would be better to talk about anxiety, chronic itching, etc. and offer the patient some potential treatments. CFS, fibromyalgia and IBS patients are in a similar situation.</i><p>There&#x27;s a disease called Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) that some people get after heavy use of psychedelics. The theory I subscribe to is that they&#x27;re actually overreacting (almost obsessively) to the defects in perception that we all have. For example, if you stare at a bright white screen, especially when tired, you&#x27;ll eventually see &quot;static&quot; due to retinal fatigue happening at uneven rates. The brain filters out a lot, but when that filter is weakened or challenged, it can let &quot;hallucinations&quot; in. Most of us aren&#x27;t bothered by &quot;white screen static&quot; and hardly notice it. For some people (such as those with HPPD, who may have strong emotional associations with &quot;tripping&quot;) that can be very distressing. In extreme cases, they can&#x27;t go out at night because they&#x27;re bothered by (again) scotopic vision defects that all of us have, but that (due to their anxiety) they can&#x27;t tune out.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed with anxiety is that there are things that are hard to un-notice. For example, after reading that article, I itched like hell. I knew why, so I didn&#x27;t need other explanations (I basically know that reading any article about health problems is going to be a bit masochistic) but there are some distressing thoughts that are just very hard to banish, especially in a state of fatigue (which is not uncommon in our overworked, bizarre society). None of us is fully in control of our focus, and sometimes it&#x27;s possible to get into a feedback loop of anxiety producing weird symptoms (panic attacks, for example, can throw all kinds of shit... even phantom smells) that produce more intense focus and anxiety.",1418957652

8770887,comment,8769925,8769925,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"<i>They say that what people like him are really suffering from is a form of psychosis called delusions of parasitosis, or DOP. He is, in other words, crazy.</i><p>This is one of the problems in our society, even in psychiatry. (The OP deals with the binary nature we apply to such things, but could have gone deeper.) This idea that there are &quot;crazy&quot; people who have all kinds of mental illness, in full cinematic severity, all of the time, and &quot;sane&quot; people who have none isn&#x27;t accurate. About 30 to 50% of the population will have diagnosable mental illness at some point in life. (We use our brains for so many things; that we&#x27;d have problems with them, over an 80-year life, shouldn&#x27;t surprise anyone.) Likewise, most people with MH diagnoses are normal most of the time. It doesn&#x27;t define one as a person, any more than heart disease or fibromyalgia does. This parasitosis is shocking people because it&#x27;s occurring in relatively normal individuals, but that&#x27;s actually the truth for most of these diseases. Most people with panic attacks or depression don&#x27;t seem &quot;insane&quot;, because (although they have mental illnesses) they&#x27;re not.<p>We need to stop thinking of these as alien, stigmatized conditions and start viewing them as &quot;boring&quot; chronic health problems that, while they are painful and deserve compassion and treatment, don&#x27;t merit treating someone as if his life is already forfeit (like a cancer patient in the 1940s, an AIDS patient in the 1990s, or a schizophrenic in the 2010s). Panic disorder, for one example, is more like a milder version of epilepsy than a typical &quot;mental illness&quot;. It doesn&#x27;t impair judgment or cause delusions; it&#x27;s just very upsetting and difficult.<p>Most people with mental illness are mostly sane most of the time. In our society, we tend to focus on the highly visible and extreme cases, not on the &quot;boring&quot; and often treatable ones that are more common. Major depression doesn&#x27;t mean that a person is always miserable; it means that a person is unusually prone to attacks of negative mood, often unprovoked. You can have MDD and still be happy most (say, 80%) of the time. In fact, quite a large number of people with anxiety and mood disorders are more functional than the general population when unaffected by the disease (which can be anywhere from 30 to 90% of the time; trust me that if you have two weeks of mania and two weeks of major depression per year, you&#x27;re still bipolar and need help).<p><i>“In my experience, Morgellons patients are doing the best they can to make sense of symptoms that are real. These people have been maltreated by the medical establishment. And you’re very welcome to quote me on that. They’re suffering from a chronic itch disorder that’s undiagnosed.”</i><p>This seems likely. Even if the disease is &quot;psychological&quot;, it&#x27;s still real pain that they&#x27;re suffering. I understand that it may require more attention from psychiatrists than dermatologists, but that doesn&#x27;t invalidate the disease and the importance of treating it.<p>It can be called enigmatic because it seems (from what I&#x27;ve read) to be psychiatric and is popping up in &quot;normal&quot; people, but the fact is that <i>most</i> mental illnesses (panic, anxiety, depression, OCD) pop up in otherwise normal people.<p><i>But, she adds, that is not to say there aren’t some patients whose major problem is psychiatric. Others still might suffer delusions in addition to their undiagnosed neuropathic illness.</i><p>I&#x27;m not altogether convinced that there&#x27;s a difference between neurological and psychiatric illnesses. I&#x27;ve often thought that panic disorder is a non-lethal (albeit distressing and sometimes just weird) cousin of epilepsy (generally classified as neurological) and that the &quot;Asperger&#x27;s syndrome&quot; (neurological) often observed in highly intelligent young people is actually a mild, subclinical cyclothymia (bipolar) disorder. (People with true neurological social disabilities, such as with autism or head injuries, don&#x27;t grow out of them in their mid-20s; but people with mild bipolar disorders have a social experience deficit that would match that pattern. Being 20% behind at age 15 is catastrophic; at 30, it&#x27;s quirky; at 40, it&#x27;s a non issue.)<p>Anyway, fuck the people who say that a disease being &quot;psychiatric&quot; means that it shouldn&#x27;t be treated. It reminds me of the claims adjuster in <i>Memento</i> (ignoring issues of unreliable narration and the question of what really happened) who wanted to weasel out of covering treatment for amnesia because it was &quot;psychological&quot;.",1418957069

It shows there are places with a lot greater efficiency that are competing fiercely with the local source and are forcing specialization.<p>Services are not commodities: a service by one provider is not necessarily indistinguishable from another. Service providers, and producers in general, actually vigorously fight commoditization -- it creates an opportunity for a market, and this improves competitiveness and efficiency. The providers are comfortable with their high margin untradable goods, but consumers get high price variability and discover-ability. Since the service providers fully control the service, they are unlikely to ever allow a market to form.<p>Now imagine the opposite: imagine servers became fully commoditized. The market then would become highly specialized and efficient: you would probably be purchasing server time directly from the server manufacturer (chosen among many) through some contract and a provider (again chosen among many) would actually host the server and electricity for a cost.

8770825,comment,8768407,8768638,0,0,userbinator,,,"Agreed; what I think to be an ideal solution would be a band with a USB interface that presents itself as a standard mass storage device, logs its data to one or more files stored on it, and its configuration is also accessible in the same way. NAND flash is cheap - and one of these could also double as a USB drive in the same way as a lot of media players. (Incidentally, I think adding a few extra sensors to an existing wearable media player platform wouldn&#x27;t be all that difficult; now you get a band that can play music too...) That in no way precludes supplying an app that can automatically parse that data and generate pretty graphs etc.<p>Instead, the only products available from the big companies seem to require some proprietary app to interface them and give very little control of their data - the user&#x27;s own <i>health data</i> - to the user, which is certainly disappointing and agrees with the trend of devices getting more and more locked-down against their users. They seem to be going out of their way to make it hard to &quot;extract&quot; the data from their devices, almost as if &quot;plug it in and copy the data over&quot; scares them.<p>I specifically mentioned &quot;big companies&quot; because what I find somewhat ironic is that it&#x27;s the cheap, unbranded far-Eastern manufacturers who are more likely to come up with products based on existing standards than invent their own proprietary protocols. For example <a href=""http://www.amazon.co.uk/Multifunction-Personallized-Signature-Pedometer-Watch/dp/B00H45TEYC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Multifunction-Personallized-Signatur...</a> is very similar to the concept I have in mind, and it&#x27;s a completely non-cloud-based device, but the reviews show users complaining that it&#x27;s &quot;too difficult to use&quot;.",1418955256
8770824,comment,8770705,8770705,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"Put options allow you to sell at a specified strike priceat some future date. If you expect stocks in that sector to fall, you buy a put option (I think for about 5% of the strike price) and wait. If the stocks are above the strike price on that date, then your option is worthless and you lose the money you spent because you made a bad decision. If stocks are below the strike price (by an amount equal to the cost of the option + transaction fees - say, 7.5%) then you buy the now-cheap stock on the open market, sell it for the strike price to the now sad-faced counterparty, and pocket the difference.<p>Alternatively you could sell short but hedge your bet with a call option, which allows you to buy at a particular price in order to cover your short, thus limiting your downside risk.<p>I&#x27;m no financial adviser, though. You should really deal with a broker for this - explain your expectation of market behavior (eg a 50% decline in stock value across the sector within 6 months) and then ask the broker how to maximize your upside and minimize your exposure up to the amount of money you are willing to lose if you are wrong. Don&#x27;t forget the old maxim &#x27;the market can remain irrational for longer than you can remain solvent&#x27; - place your bet and then mentally write it off as a loss, not an asset. If it turns out you bought a golden ticket then hooray, but timing the market is essentially a big gamble and gamblers lose more often than they win. That strikes me as another reason to use a broker; having someone else doing the execution lowers the temptation to go double-or-nothing in a surge of adrenalin. If the market behaves in accordance with your theory, you get a nice check in the mail, if not you spend some time regretting the other ways you could have spent the money but without the nausea that follows an adrenalin rush.",1418955228

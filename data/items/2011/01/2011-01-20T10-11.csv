You might also want to switch to a front-page layout that's similar to the kind already widely in use.

2123236,comment,2121565,2122308,0,0,Peaker,,,"When modern copyrights were first created in the US, they were viewed as a necessary evil. Society trades some of its liberty (publishers' copying for 14-28 years, mainly) hoping this will increase incentive and thus authorship of new works. Back then, they were viewed as a ""necessary evil"".<p>Since then, a few things happened:<p>* The public domain is no longer expanded, copyright terms have become effectively infinite<p>* The view of copyrights as a trade was replaced by a view of ""protecting authors""<p>* This view of ""protecting authors"" almost implies the view that infringement is ""stealing"".<p>* Everyone can now copy easily, not just publishers, so that the restrictions that applied to a tiny minority now restrict everyone's freedom much more harshly<p>I agree with the view that it <i>may</i> be a necessary evil (even though even at the time of copyright's inception there was some empiric evidence that copyright was in fact unnecessary to form business models around authorship). I personally believe:<p>* 5 years are a more reasonable copyright term in the modern age<p>* Copyrights should only apply to for-profit institutions (e.g: publishers), similarly to how they were practically applied in earlier days. Individuals should not be restricted by copyrights, and we shouldn't have a police-state surveillance to enforce copyrights or any other law against people in the privacy of their homes.<p>* Copyrights should not apply to ""functional"" works (e.g: Software). I see short copyright terms restricting our enjoyment of the arts and entertainment as reasonable, but copyrights artificially restricting our use of existing resources as very harmful.<p>* Software tends to form a ""net-effect"" following which makes it difficult to compete, even when you have better software (e.g: Windows isn't technically superior to Linux, but the huge net effect around it is simply too overwhelming to compete with). This means that opensource software cannot gain traction when competing with closed-source software, and that's harmful for society.  Software should be open for everyone to modify and distribute by law.<p>* There are plenty of more efficient business models that will allow creation of useful software in the absence of copyrights (Contract work, pay-per-feature, support, etc)<p>* Any loss in incentive to create new works will be more than offset by the increase in efficiency (anyone can improve and extend any existing work, rather than having to duplicate it, in order to implement any idea).<p>* Derivative works are likely to form a huge stream of new works that we're currently losing out on, which is also likely to offset any loss of work due to lesser incentives.<p>In summary:<p>I don't view copyright infringement as theft at all.",1295519684

Maybe they actively want to do something bad. Maybe you are not correct in your beliefs about what they are doing. But I think the reason you gave why they need to violate people's privacy is a cop out.<p>There are also a number of counter-examples where corporations fail to maximize shareholder profits by donating to charity, taking principled environmental stances, etc. I don't know how you or anyone could come to the conclusion that the U.S. legal system rigidly enforces absolute profit maximization.<p>> Oh, and by the way, the government can have access to all that data without a search warrant.<p>Don't know where you are getting this from.",1295518981

""Snow White"" or ""the evil Queen""?!<p>Although it doesn't seem, people don't usually want to know existing answers that are already indexed somewhere; they want to know ""How will the weather be tomorrow?"". Google will answer to that question by looking up words, ranks, links and so on and it'll provide you the most ""relevant answer"". For Google, not for you. You are left with taking this answer for granted, although it comes out of Google's bellies exclusively. More than that, the answer tends to become ""correct"" although it cannot bear this value.<p>A search engine that's not already containing the answer (truth-bearer) will only offer opinions (non-truth-bearer); these ""opinions"" are never true or false, so they cannot be part of any reliable judgement. Google says these answers are to be trusted because they're relevant, not because they're true. But this relevance is not dependent on me, the  one asking the question, but on Google's bellies!

So there is some logic to burying yourself in your chosen profession when you are  young and learning as much as you possibly can.<p>2.  Thanks to the beauty of compound interest the money you make in your 20s and 30s is worth several times more than the money you’ll make in the entire rest of your life.  So it make sense to get as good as you can at what you do, make a decent amount of money and sock it away when you’re young<p>3.  When you’re young your body is generally in the best shape it will ever be.  I personally think everyone should have the experience of partying all night or picking up potential mates at a bar.  That’s really only possible when you’re young (or at least it gets harder the older you get).<p>4.  You’re more useful to society if you take the skills you do well and find a way to contribute with them.  What’s better, a programmer spending his day hammering nails badly or a programmer who donates a day’s wages and hires 3 guys who have worked construction and know what they’re doing?<p>I’m not against public service.  But if you focus on yourself until you’re say…40…you’ll still have a good 50 to 60 years to go out and do as much public service as you want.  There’s nothing wrong with using your youth to establish yourself in the world and then turning your attention to bettering the world once you’re settled in.",1250153988

After half a year we had more than 50 ideas that were all patentable, gamechanging or could make lots and lots of money. Some of them have later been implemented successfully by startups vouching for the fact they were indeed pretty good ideas. At least some of them :-)<p>We stopped because it became obvious to us that a binder (yes this was before computers were in wide use) full of great ideas is worth exactly nothing.<p>So what do I do when I come up with a great idea? I forget it as quickly as possible so I can concentrate on executing what I'm doing now.",1250153972

For instance, I would love to work on something world-changing like time-travel, teleportation, or anti-gravity, but there are currently no fruitful ways of even approaching those problems.<p>I had an advisor tell me that I should always be keeping several ""big"" problems on the backburners at all times, so that whenever I find out about a new technique or technology, I will be able to immediately think of ways to apply the new tools to the big problems. He said it will fail 99 percent of the time, but on the 1 percent of the time that it does work, everything will somehow fit together and with any luck, you will have found a viable approach.",1250153940

It's not just strictly a matter of time being available logically;  it takes energy, mental and spiritual, to come home at 7 PM and then compose symphonies until bed time.<p>Some people are more insistent than others at doing what they want to in spite of what they have to, but it's not reasonable to expect most people to do that even if the availability is technically there.  We may have it easy compared to our ancestors from many economic and physical points of view, but that doesn't mean we aren't plagued with some of the problems existentially perennial to the economic man.<p>EDIT: Also, I am not sure that the ""echo chamber"" that characterises Valley web startup culture is any more sealed or myopic than the echo chambers of other comparably specialised combinations of professional endeavour.  Ever seen what financial instruments traders breathe, eat, snort, etc. 24/7?  People who participate in insurance industry MLM schemes?  People ""tracked"" for ""blue-collar"" skilled trades?  People who love and excel at working on cars or motorcycles?  Realtors, mortgage brokers?  I'm talking about the folks that are on top of their game in those respective sectors - the ""hackers"" - not the most bromidically average, uninspired 9-to-5ers.  It's very similar.",1250153612

And weasel words ('the safety device') are not needed, you could simply take your own medicine and do your research yourself, then eat some crow.<p>The Indian software landscape is too large and too diverse to make such sweeping generalizations by one person with a possibly limited view of things. I'd hazard such a statement about my own country, which is a <i>LOT</i> smaller than India.<p>The outsourcing wave has put lots of money into the Indian economy, and just like what happened in Japan after drudgework and copying comes a wave of innovation.

India is not doomed to be an outsourcing venue for ever, they'll be a force to reckon with (and in fact, already are).<p>Expect a large wave of startups from the region in the next 5 years, they have one headstart over everybody else, ramen profitable there means hosting + $500 / month.",1250153567

Though, I would also take exception to some of the statements you have made.\nI have worked for a year in one of the services companies (I detest the word body-shoppers) you've mentioned. I have also worked in Bangalore for an ODC of a US technology products company. It is true to say that most of the work done in these organizations is not really technically sophisticated.<p>The part of your note which did not resonate well with me was this: ""except a couple of very small unfunded startups, most are just trying to copy existing ideas and don't need any skills beyond pretty generic php mysql etc"". \n- I'm not sure what kind of research would give you the necessary insight to make such a statement.

Can you estimate the carbon footprint created by such a telecommute?\n- The Carbon Footprint generated by a single roundtrip flight between India and USA / Canada overshoots the annual footprint of an average Indian by 62%. To suggest a telecommuting option between the India and US to me is absurd and environmentally criminal.<p>Also, the wishlist you have given for Indian startups does exist. You just need to look for it in the right places. Such information would not come to you on the headlines of ET but is available deep in the web somewhere.<p>I have realized that ""great"" (I'm not sure how you define such a term) engineers in India like to be courted by companies as they feel that by gaining intellectual prowess they should just have to sit back and wait for companies to come to them. This is especially true if one has been working for a large US Tech MNCs. This is not really the mindset for entrepreneurship. \nIf you are really looking to join an Indian startup as a part of the founding team- reach out to them and let them know what you can offer instead of waiting for them to add a job listing here.",1250153267

Dedicating a lot of time and energy to something is definitely fulfilling and has a compounding effect, but as many astute programmers have noticed, there is an echo-chamber effect if all the information you get is from programmers and the programming world. Worse, you could continue to hold incredibly inaccurate beliefs about other people like the professional photographer in the article, and make judgment calls based on that false information.<p>Of course you need something to bring to table in modern times, to be a productive member of society.

If you're driven to do something you might as well do it rather than always second guessing yourself, or imagining what might have been.<p>On the other hand, there is a sort of frenzied mania that exists in the valley that I think is very limiting if you buy into too much.  For the cool stuff that happens here there exists the same sort of herd mentality that geeks often decry in places where they don't fit in, the only difference being the fads here are more to our sensibilities.<p>FWIW I spent my teens and early twenties being a total slacker, and I don't regret it one bit.  I went to public school and I got to know people from all walks of life.  I did not move to the valley until I was 30.

Opportunities come up and you should take advantage of them.  You shouldn't get bogged down with too much planning for the future, because the world we live in now is not the world of the future.

Unfocused and inconsistent innovation? Maybe. Too much? No such thing.<p>Searching for a root cause, however, I would point to the leadership. Lack of focus and and consistency is directly derived from poor leadership, which is only partly due to poor leaders. I'd say that the absolute root cause of our problems is antiquated value-systems in use by leadership.<p>In order to get a mass of talented people doing amazing things, you need leadership to provide one thing effectively: alignment. Not mandated directives; you need clarity of purpose.

I think this article failed by trying to relate eigenvalues to everyday scenarios, similar to when beginning calculus books give examples involving total pressure on an underwater dam door or mass of a rod as examples for the usefulness of definite integrals.  In those cases, you end up calculating the area under the curve, but the curve happens to be the graph of a constant function or a first-order polynomial.  Calculating such areas can easily be done by using the elementary formula for the area of a trapezoid.",1250150892

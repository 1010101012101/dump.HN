They aren't ""taking a gamble"" on some new markets, think of it more like VC.  As long as they monetize a couple things in a pile of ideas, they win.<p>I think they do a pretty good job of keeping it from diluting their brand, too.  Somewhere after GMail and Google docs, they stopped branding stuff outside their search business with a big bright Google logo -- rather, most things keep their own brands (YouTube, Lively, Orkut, etc.) even thought they are Google companies.  As a result, if I ask my mom, ""What's Google for?""  She'll say, ""Looking stuff up on the internet.""",1215791778

This is a <i>terrible forum</i> for discussing political issues -- because the signal-to-noise in politics is very low (any political discussion is mostly about team-building, horse-trading, and tooth-baring, not problem-solving or analysis and certainly not software or technology) and we don't have the time to wade through waist-deep piles of personal statements, deal memos, and threats; because this site draws people from <i>very</i> diverse political backgrounds who will take a <i>very long time</i> to reach equilibrium if they start team-building, horse-trading, or baring their teeth; but mostly because the place just works better if there's some focus. It helps us to know when to shut up.<p>I interpret PG's mission statement <i>not</i> as an attempt to ensure that ""anything of interest to anyone smart"" is on topic, but as a signal that <i>he</i> doesn't want to be the Big Man who sets the agenda for news.yc.

This is the reason the Cessna 172 is still one of the most widely used general-aviation aircraft used today, powered by 1960s-era Lycoming or Continental engines. There is a huge opportunity here, but every major manufacturer is afraid to make the leap.

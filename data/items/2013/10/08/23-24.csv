6518672,comment,6517847,6518591,16,0,hamburglar,,,"A regular file has two obvious disadvantages: first, you write all the data to disk and read it back again, which costs you time and disk space.  In a pipe, the data is streamed, with the OS doing buffering for you.  Second, if you have one process writing to a plain file and another process reading from it, you need some way of signaling when there&#x27;s data ready to be read and when the reader should wait, or when the stream has ended.  A pipe provides this for you: in blocking IO mode, the reader just issues a read() and blocks until the writer writes something.",1381276781

They few I&#x27;ve spoken to about it seemed very nice.<p>>Stealing all of the bottles out of recycling bins...<p>Are you sure it&#x27;s stealing? AFAIK, it&#x27;s only stealing if the bin is on/at the curb. I believe it&#x27;s otherwise legal.<p>>...out of recycling bins is also not accomplishing anything.<p>The question is: is the system as a whole accomplishing anything? The removal of cans from residential bins is the unintended consequence of a wider rule, which has (according to the article) reduced litter levels in CA considerably. All systems have unintended consequences. What alternative system do you propose that reduces litter and increases recycling rates? What side effects does it have?<p>Finally (I&#x27;m going out on a limb here): I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s our place to judge. What I see when I look out the window is a person who has the determination and energy to push a heavy cart up a hill on a cold night, and yet a person who has -- despite those traits, which society values -- found themselves in an unenviable life position right now. When I see that paradox my reaction is to allow them their wish. Not because I do or don&#x27;t approve of the system, but because I approve or hard work, and applying yourself, and because the very existence of their paradox assures me that I don&#x27;t know enough to do anything other than make sure I&#x27;m not getting in their way.",1381276740

In general, it behaves the same way that a normal file behaves, in the sense that you read what was written, in the order it was written.<p>The only difference in behavior I can think of is timing. Generally, when you read a text file, you see what is written at that moment in time (barring race conditions). With named pipes, you read what has been written, and then wait until the program writing closes the pipe. If anything gets written in the meantime, you still see it.

I think there needs to be a way to limit the voice of each user so each person has the same amount of influence.<p>One idea I like is to give each user 100 points to distribute among topics. Once the user has assigned a certain number of points for or against a position, they could then distribute those points amongst the comments that best represent their position. So if a user votes 20 points for gun control, gun control would get 20 points, and the user would have to choose which comments best support their position--5 points to this comment, 7 points for this comment, etc.<p>I think this would solve two problems: it would encourage thoughtful opinions to rise to the top, and it would give voice to the minority of voters that care passionately about a topic that the majority disagrees with or doesn&#x27;t care about.",1381275960

It would indicate that &quot;the market&quot; believes there may be some technical non payment scenario over the short term (so, government shutdown related), but there appears to be no fear-mongery shaking of the faith in the nation. As you can see in the link the 30yr bond&#x27;s yield has in fact fallen over the same period.<p>As this is a technical crowd, and there are requests for layman explanations, I&#x27;ll elaborate some: Yield = Interest rate. This is inverse to the price of the bond. If you hold a bond and the yield rises (say, from 10bps to 27bps), you have lost money on your holding since the market price fell. The unexpected yield increase (price fall) on short term treasuries is notable because short term government bonds are held in large quantity by very risk averse investors (e.g. money market accounts) that not expecting to take losses. The unlikely downside scenario of a one off non-payment or deferred payment may cause settlement problems in short-term bond markets, or even a &quot;freeze&quot; as happened after Lehman collapsed.<p>Typically the yield of a bond increases over longer maturities because there is more time for something to potentially go wrong leading to an inability to pay. Thankfully, the United States is a sovereign nation that prints its money on keyboards, so that is only possible if a decision not to pay is made.",1381275312

They also happily will just shut down things like Google Checkout and offer no replacement at all for key use cases like &quot;sell a physical product&quot; (if you sell digital goods, you might be able to switch to Google Wallet Objects, an &quot;exciting new API&quot; released a couple weeks before Checkout was deprecated).<p>Google Checkout was certainly also targetted at enterprises, had a clear business model behind it, and had existed since 2006: everyone who built on that one (again, not me: I avoided Checkout like the plague) got only six months to migrate to a different provider (and figure out how they are going to handle any refund requests from recent customers, which will surely be horribly irritating as they won&#x27;t be able to just tell Checkout to refund the transaction anymore). There is simply a patterned lack of care for people who may have built things on their stacks.<p>(Yes, some services have deprecation policies, but let&#x27;s not forget that those guarantees were themselves attempts to regain faith due to a previous round of services that had been axed with little warning ;P.

This is a very short time period, as Treasurys are for sale in 1-mo to 30-year periods.

But with the recent debt ceiling / government shutdown rhetoric the market is beginning to get a little worried, so the premium the government must pay in order to borrow money has increased.<p>Basically by the Congress/White-House being deadlocked and having such fiery rhetoric it begins to appears as if there is a chance of default, and that chance is slightly higher than normal, so the risk/return on the 1 mo treasury has increased, as reflected in the increased interest rate the government has to pay to its bond holders.",1381273603

Bloodline became more of a focus during and after the Holocaust -- which is somewhat bitterly ironic, given that the Holocaust was perpetrated in the name of blood purity.<p>As a &quot;half-Jew,&quot; and particularly as someone whose Jewish half is on the paternal side, I&#x27;ve been deemed &quot;not really Jewish&quot; by almost all but the most Reform branches of Judaism that I&#x27;ve encountered. I wouldn&#x27;t be accepted into an Orthodox congregation except by conversion, because I am considered a gentile in their eyes. Even after being bar mitzvahed, I was labeled a &quot;Jew by choice,&quot; with the slightly derisive implication that such a label carried second-class status among the Jewish populace. The obsession with matrilineal purity is still quite strong.<p>It shouldn&#x27;t be. Jews make up an extreme minority of the worldwide population, and even of the US population. If anything, the faith needs to expand, not double down on supposed bloodline purity (especially purity of increasingly dubious genetic provability). But bloodline still carries a lot of weight in many Jewish communities, typically in direct proportion to the degree of religious orthodoxy of a given community. (My paternal grandmother, a <i>third-generation</i> Jewish American, refused to attend my parents&#x27; wedding on account of my father&#x27;s marrying a gentile. She, like many old-school Jews, didn&#x27;t quite understand the mathematical implications of marrying within the faith and the supposed bloodline -- that it is a self-limiting strategy, and potentially self-defeating, given how often the faith has come close to being severely endangered).",1381273405

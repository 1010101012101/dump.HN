I believe if they&#x27;ve made a movie they have the right to distribute it in whatever countries they want, whenever they want. They&#x27;ve put this together pretty damn quick too, I think they deserve a break. In fact they&#x27;re hoping to expand the available countries to at least Canada in a day or two [1]. They probably already have distribution deals in place around the world (let&#x27;s not forget the movie was only getting a US cinema release tomorrow originally) and those are probably limiting the VOD options.<p>As for copyright in general - extended copyright laws are nuts. I personally think it&#x27;s fair for someone to have copyright until they die (no passing it on to relatives etc.). Also, it&#x27;s a unpopular opinion here, but I consider piracy theft. And I&#x27;m not saying that to be morally superior - I&#x27;ve pirated lots of stuff but I consider it theft and wrong.<p>[1] <a href=""https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/547826019390865408"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/Sethrogen/status/547826019390865408</a>",1419454656

The closest we have are economic analogs. For example, resource rich locations that produce wealth at multiples of the labor input. You can study the economics of these places yourself and look at the outcomes. But they basically sum to: people stop working, people collect their money, labor supply needs to be imported from outside the local economy, the people who&#x27;ve stopped working don&#x27;t exactly spend this new free-time self-actualizing themselves into discovering cures for cancer or unifying the fundamental forces of the universe.<p>If you want evidence, I suggest you open a high-school level history book and start on page 1.

Your &quot;multiple vendors&quot; probably means &quot;less than a dozen vendors&quot;, which is insignificant given there are tens of thousands of vendors in the world accepting Bitcoin.<p>> How about the fact that bitpay has been claiming the 1m a day in transactions now for over half a year? How about that for no growth?<p>Ha! Now you change your claim. You talked earlier about a significant reduction, a &quot;huge flop&quot;. Now you claim stagnation, no growth. That&#x27;s very different.<p>> Here are the figures from their releases so far\n> Jan 10 - 130K Jan 11-29 - $26K/day average Next 36 days to March 4th they do $400K - $11K/day average Next 83 days to May 27th they do $600K - $7200/day average\n> Now they are claiming $7000 a day. Given that the $7200 * the number of days left in the year = $3m I&#x27;m guessing we&#x27;ll see that $3m number change again when they actually release their financials.<p>Sales were declining, but not anymore, not since September, not since the last 3 months. That is exactly what I claimed, and nothing more. I said: &quot;They have reached a steady state of $7000-8000 a day FOR THE LAST 3 MONTHS&quot; (emphasis mine).<p>> Cash works like this because you are physically present with the merchant when you use it so you can validate immediately if you are getting ripped off or not.<p>Exactly, and I am glad to see you acknowledge that Bitcoin&#x27;s lack of CC-like consumer protections is a total non-problem in such scenarios. You made it sound like such protections were absolutely necessary, at all time, or else Bitcoin can never work!!!!!1!one<p>> Right but it has to satisfy enough common ones to convince users to make the additional effort to acquire it. It&#x27;s not doing that.<p>Yes, and I think you will agree that &quot;reducing fraud to zero for merchants&quot; is a pretty major use case given that fraud is a huge problem for merchants online. As well as &quot;being able to pay a trusted merchant online while guaranteeing not having a CC number that can be stolen&quot; since financial theft is becoming more and more frequent.<p>> Yes that explains why there are no scams in bitcoin at all. And there were no complaints about Tigerdirect fulfillment related to bitcoin orders.<p>Technological problems from one merchant&#x27;s deployment of Bitcoin is hardly a sign that &quot;OMG Bitcoin totally doesn&#x27;t work and will never be adopted&quot; as you make it seem to be. For every customer who experiences one issue paying/getting a refund in Bitcoin, there are many more customers who do so without any problem.<p>> But it&#x27;s not a tremendous hassle. You call the bank tell them the card was stolen(or they detect it) list any transactions you didn&#x27;t make and the money is refunded and a new card is posted. There are a handful of cases where it is more difficult than that. Do you have examples of it affecting credit scores?<p>Obviously, whether it is a tremendous or a minor hassle is a matter of personal experience, and a matter of how much of your life depends on credit cards. But my point is: it can be a tremendous hassle, and credit cards do not automatically make a theft a non-issue. Some examples of major hassles: having you card stolen and having to cancel it during a vacation away from home. After a theft you have to re-configure all automatic periodic payments that were due to be processed on the CC. You forgot to give the new CC number to your cloud service provider? Oops they can suddenly shut down your instances at 3am with little to no notice. Your wife had set up some other random online service paid through the CC, but you were not aware of it? Oops her online account will be closed as fraudulent and it will take multiple phone calls and emails to the support department to get it re-opened. The CC thief&#x27;s actions lead to some negative events added to you credit history? Oops good luck spending multiple WEEKS contacting the credit scoring agencies indepedentently to get your records cleaned up, and submit the proper documentation to prove it was all due to a theft.<p>Bottom line: you know how some Bitcoin fanboys blatantly ignore its kinks? Well you are guilty of the same thing when you blatantly and childishly ignore the kinks of credit cards when they are stolen and have to be replaced.<p>> Walk me through the steps to buying and putting bitcoin on your hardware wallet that wouldn&#x27;t be compromised by the user having a virus on their computer that targeted bitcoin.<p>You mean the same computer where the virus will also steal the CC number that the user enters on a website when making a payement? Hmm? How does this virus scenario demonstrates that credit cards are safer? If the user cancels the first CC, gets a second one, what prevents the virus from stealing the second CC number at the next purchase? CCs don&#x27;t solve this virus problem at all.<p>However I can envision scenarios where Bitcoin hardware wallets actually solve this virus problem. The simplest one is: you could buy a pre-loaded cheap disposable wallet (maybe in the form factor of a credit card) hence completely skipping the virus-ladden PC.<p>> Which one have you used and I&#x27;ll tell you how to abuse it.<p>I used casascius&#x27;s Bitcoin Address Utility. It has a self-escrow (two-party escrow) functionality which is not user-friendly, but the it is cryptographically well implemented and very secure.<p>> That is a physical presence. The fact that they are using someone elses physical presence doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t need one. It means they are using someone elses locations to subsidize their own. Companies tend to not like that which is why I would put money on sendbitcoin.mx being shut down within the next 6 months.<p>We shall see.",1419452242

But The Matrix very well might.  With The Matrix it might work best if it was a mix of HFR and 24.  HFR when they are in the matrix and 24 when they are out (of course that brings another set of problems in projecting mixed frame rates in the same movie).<p>HFR  I believe would work really well in sci-fi that is meant to look and feel a bit sterile (think THX1138, The Island, etc.).  Or in heavily CGI scenes.<p>The big problem with The Hobbit, since it is the first, there is still a bit of working out the kinks and bugs (lighting to me was a big issue in the first HFR film).  Give it time and it might prove an indispensable creative tool.",1419451792

Under a negative income tax, a marginal increase in income still results in a marginal increase in take home pay; you can&#x27;t get penalized by earning more, so the policy preserves the incentive for people to earn more.  To me, this seems preferable to an unconditional payment because you&#x27;re focusing all of the dispersed money on people who need it.",1419451717

But if new homes drop below the cost of production then we&#x27;re in trouble.<p>Any economic model that doesn&#x27;t assume for the cost of production simply isn&#x27;t realistic.<p>Japan has a particularly weird model that might work: homes drop in price like cars over time, so prestige signalling means building a new house and not living in an old one. It also means homes are built cheaply and without intention to last more than a couple decades. It <i>also</i> means that the new home construction industry maintains a fairly flat work schedule and increases certainty.<p>There&#x27;s a bunch of other construction economics that occur in Japan. Something like 5% of the people working in Japan work in construction.<p>Studies of Japanese economics are interesting in terms of how many economic problems the Japanese have tried to solve with construction projects.<p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/asia/06japan.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/06/world/asia/06japan.html?pa...</a><p><a href=""http://bigthink.com/Global-Pedestrian/needless-dams-and-roads-to-nowhere-in-japan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bigthink.com/Global-Pedestrian/needless-dams-and-road...</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16dam.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/world/asia/16dam.html</a><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx63GTCFKzY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sx63GTCFKzY</a><p><a href=""http://regex.info/blog/2007-03-25/403"" rel=""nofollow"">http://regex.info/blog/2007-03-25/403</a><p><a href=""http://nfggames.com/neography/photos/paved.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nfggames.com/neography/photos/paved.htm</a><p><a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/world/asia/07iht-07japan.8224900.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/07/world/asia/07iht-07japan.8...</a>",1419451417

But a major problem I faced then was dealing with a few matrix operations, for which I had to write out a lot of code.

8245874,comment,8237352,8237352,1,0,Ecio78,,,"I think it could, as always, depend on the quality of the teacher. I am not speaking about Cisco courses, but I recently attended a Microsoft course and the course was provided through recorded material prepared by Microsoft, with a local trainer that could be questioned in case of need (this was due to the fact that I was attending the course in English and the training center was normally organizing it in another language). The Microsoft &quot;recorded&quot; teacher knew his stuff, but the local teacher was not that expert because he was acting as supporting teacher for many many courses (we were 6 people in the class, each one doing a different course: AD, Exchange, SQL Server etc..)\nSo I missed a bit of interaction AND real-life stories that you typically exchange with other students and with the teacher as well.\nFortunately the course was paid by my company, but I came back thinking that maybe paying 29$ for a month of Pluralsight would have been a better investment than spending 2000$ for the official MSFT course (even better subscribing for a full year of pluralsight and having the possibilities of having many more additional training videos).<p>Having said that, for Cisco I&#x27;ll suggest you to check the Chris Bryant courses available on Udemy [no affiliation], I bought one of them (CCNA) few months ago but just right after I was hired in a non-networking position (and in a company that is not using Cisco) so I never finished it, but the quality seems to be very good and it is confirmed by the number of comments on Udemy and also checking certification forums like Techexam.net. It seems that he also replies to questions inside Udemy, so the interaction is clearly present.",1409382528

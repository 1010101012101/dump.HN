3413695,comment,3412891,3412891,0,0,adaml,,,"Joel Schindall, an EE at MIT, tells a good story about this:<p>The ship date for a chip he was managing was just a few weeks away when he got a call from a supplier informing him that a key component would be delayed. Worried, he went to one of the engineers who designed the chip and told him of the problem.<p>The engineer was not concerned; ""I thought they might not deliver that component, so I left extra space around it where we can add these additional parts that do the same thing.""<p>Joel was happy, but surprised, and he took a closer look at the chip. ""But you didn't leave extra space for other components on the chip.""<p>""Yeah,"" the engineer replied, ""I just didn't think those would be a problem.""<p>One of the harder jobs in engineering and design is anticipating problems. That engineer took the time to think carefully about the problems that might arise with each of the components on the chip, prioritized the risk, and only spent the time to really carefully architect the parts of the circuit that were most likely to be trouble.<p>It seems that software is the same way; the best coders will assess the risk of all the code they write, and only spend their time and energy to protect against the problems that are most likely to arise. That leads to code that is better than ""good enough"" but is not over-architected. Of course, that intuition is really hard to develop and impossible to perfect.",1325447721

3413661,comment,3413379,3413379,0,0,j_baker,,,"So much to say here.  I think this is an important issue.  Being kid-like is central to being creative.  But at the same time, being adult-like is central to being productive.  The key isn't to become a creative kid who does nothing productive any more than it is to become an adult who does a lot but accomplishes nothing[1].<p>A few other thoughts on this subject:<p>I don't think that being child-like necessarily means one should think less.  You just have to think <i>differently</i>.  We adults have lots of experience that makes us think a certain way.  Part of going back to being a kid is in learning to think in ways that bypasses that experience.  For example, experience has taught me that Java is the best language to use for a team of 100 programmers.  But I'm going to use Python for reasons x, y, and z.<p>Nor do I think it's a <i>compliment</i> to be called overly kid-like.  Bear something else in mind:  kids are fairly self-centered.  They're at the stage in life where everything is about <i>them</i>.  Everybody drops what they're doing to take care of them.  Narcissists are people who are essentially frozen at this stage in time.  This is why some people have noticed that there's a correlation between narcissism and creativity[2].<p>All the above noted, I <i>do</i> think that we as adults need to remind ourselves that we can't be adults all the time.  It's just a question of when the time is appropriate, which can be <i>very</i> difficult to determine.<p><i>Did you know that we invented children? Children don’t exist.</i><p>I realize the irony in my <i>thinking</i> to refute a statement that's intended to point out why you <i>shouldn't</i> think.  But this is a non-sequitur.  We invented laptops, and there's a laptop right in front of me to prove that it exists.  Race and gender are invented concepts as well, and they have a very real impact on our day-to-day lives.<p>[1] Shameless plug, I've already written on this subject:  <a href=""http://jasonmbaker.com/how-to-be-creative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jasonmbaker.com/how-to-be-creative</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.fastcompany.com/1701676/narcissism-and-creativity-intriguing-and-troubling-findings"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fastcompany.com/1701676/narcissism-and-creativity...</a>",1325446940

3413611,comment,3412289,3412289,0,0,georgieporgie,,,"Here's my take on it, for what it's worth:<p>1)  Getting mental health care (in the US) is difficult.  There is still a social stigma, to be sure, but the bigger problem is that it's just hard to find it.  I mentioned before that during a bout of depression, I called several psychiatrists' offices and left messages, and none of them even called me back to reject me, much less help me find care elsewhere.  When you're already depressed, overcoming hurdles like this is the last thing you need.<p>2)  Programming is isolating, and we many of us do it when we should be developing core social skills.  I don't know about the rest of HN, but I got my first computer when I was eight years old (Commodore VIC-20).  I became obsessed with computers, and spent an inordinate amount of my life with them.  Sure, I had friends, but I don't think I spent as much time developing deep relationships and shared experiences as I should have.  I went straight into college, with the goal of getting done as soon as possible in order to start working with computers.  Around the age of 30, I realized I'd spent my career either sitting behind a computer alone, or dealing with fairly antagonistic personalities in meetings.<p>Personally, I'm a big fan of the gap year concept.  Getting out, traveling, seeing how life happens in other parts of the world, and simply interacting with people outside of tech was a big eye-opener for me.  I can't recommend strongly enough that, if you're around 20 and notice that you spend a lot of time with computers, and maybe aren't totally satisfied with your social life and set of life experiences, that you immediately consider going abroad for a year or two.  Teach English.  Join the Peace Corps.  You will almost certainly learn valuable social skills that you don't even know you're missing.",1325445672

I'm not in the least against people choosing to operate their personal economies around barter based on commodities, but the data is clear; it's <i>not</i> good for any of us to use commodities as the primary means of store and exchange of value. Just as the invention of the limited company allowed entrepreneurs to start companies that benefit us all at less risk to themselves, fiat currency's greater flexibility allows us to better control both the money supply and inflation to our collective benefit.<p>Besides, calling the Federal Reserve a single point of failure is at best over-dramatic. Should we also have a free market in governments? It's not really a single point of failure by any realistic definition though. The world economy is significantly interlinked and managed by the co-ordinated action of several central banks. The dollar's value is as much backed by its use as the primary international trading currency as anything, so short of Ron Paul's proposed disowning of the dollar its value is guaranteed by a large network of individual actors, all of whom have sufficient dollar holdings that they have no interest in seeing its value collapse; while it retains its status as the only payment means for the world's single largest economy, it's fine.<p>I'm curious what mistakes you think the Federal Reserve is making now that are causing you to suffer greatly. Inflation? Low, and (while it remains low and somewhat controlled) A Good Thing as I said before. General economic malaise? No, the FR's action on quantitative easing ensured any degree of market liquidity remained in a situation where it would otherwise have dried up almost entirely through fear of unknown and unknwable liabilities. Why would the ideal remedy to a crisis caused significantly by a loss of market liquidity be to move to a medium of exchange with little or no liquidity and what there was being outside of your control?

A lot of the comments were directed to them and I think it is best to let that team handle those questions. I do want to answer some of the Analytics questions though. Phil's comment above is correct. I posted this because a couple months ago Google tested some search results that added a # into the URL. This created a big problem for people interested in seeing which keywords were driving traffic to their site (anything in the URL after a # doesn't get passed in the referrer... this is particularly a problem for web analytics products), so we worked with the search team to stop that test until they could find a better solution. The announcement above is the answer to that. It allows them to test new search results without the negative side effects (if it introduced others, that was not the intent). Some of the other comments had interesting theories about why we did this (grassy knolls not included), but the goal was to allow new tests of search without making it difficult for analytics products to report on query data.""""""<p>The post he is talking about from Phil, for reference:<p>""""""I have previously heard about (from various sources) the intent by Google to roll-out a hash '#' in the search results page URL that would strip the paramaters altogether - is this blog entry implying that this will not happen now?? or is this something different?""""""<p>This also puts forward an alternative explanation for why this is served only to JavaScript-capable clients than my theory below (which was that the goal was to use JavaScript to make the behavior transparent, but that that intention failed at a later point and was not noticed).<p>Honestly, this new explanation makes even more sense, now that I notice that the search query no longer exists in the Referer: portion of the /webhp URL that is being used for the super-fast AJAX Google search pages they have been deploying for a while now.<p>(That said, it is still really weird that they choose to hide the behavior until onmousedown; the only reason it would seen beneficial to do that is if they wanted to make the behavior transparent, and the way it is currently implemented seems to fail to do that: interacting with the link at all causes the URL to change to a /url URL.)",1325444615

Society began to relate to the child not as a miniature adult but as a person of a lower level of maturity needing adult protection, love and nurturing. This change can be traced in painting: In the Middle Ages, children were portrayed in art as miniature adults with no childish characteristics. In the 16th century, images of children began to acquire a distinct childish appearance. From the late 17th century onwards, children were shown playing.""<p>However, reading the source article (<a href=""http://www.elizabethi.org/uk/essays/childhood.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.elizabethi.org/uk/essays/childhood.htm</a>), I would say that this point of view (Lawrence Stone, et al) is not well supported.  First, realize that this insight was made only to studies of the UK from 1500-1800 (a period very likely marked more strongly by society's ability to express notions of childhood through art - the renaissance, than to evolve the definition of human childhood so rapidly).  Second, Stone himself abandoned the thesis of his work in the 1980s (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Stone#Ideas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Stone#Ideas</a>) as more evidence about this time period was presented by his peers.<p>I suspect that some of these theories would not have emerged at all if evolutionary psychology, our understanding of the mammalian brain, and studies of mammals in their natural child-rearing environments had been readily available at the time when ""The Family, Sex and Marriage in England, 1500-1800"" was written.<p>Anyhow, I challenge that wikipedia probably should not quote the work in this context in the 'Child' page, nor should it be treated as a credible theory in the discussion of this article.",1325444549

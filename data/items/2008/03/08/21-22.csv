Not going to happen.""<p>It doesn't cost you anything to offer a decent amount of vacation. That's probably the best way to avoid burning out your highly motivated hackers.

That url is your instance address. You can make a loadb alancer by installing Apache or Nginx on a server (instance or other) then from there proxy to your instances (you'll have to open the ports).

132136,comment,131691,131691,0,0,gruseom,,,"It's easy to talk about balance, and I agree; but I've observed few people achieve it. Most are either overcommitted (working like machines at the expense of their own creativity) or undercommitted (putting in time at a day job they don't much care about).<p>When people talk about how hard startups are, I think they mostly mean that you can't be in the latter category and succeed. Obviously, they don't mean ""work so much that you inhibit your own effectiveness"". But that's what most of us who take that advice end up doing. Conversely, the day-job types <i>call</i> themselves ""balanced"" but, in my observation, most are lackadaisical, which is not the same thing. (At least not for those who aspire beyond mediocrity.)<p>My point is that this is a hard problem. Glib statements for or against workaholism don't shed any light on it. But glib statements in favor of workaholism are more harmful. I worked briefly at a startup where people were looked askance at if they went home at midnight instead of 3 am. This company got <i>nothing</i> done. But they certainly pointed to every blog post about workaholic startups that they could find.",1205010469

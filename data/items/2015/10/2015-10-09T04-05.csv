I&#x27;ll suggest that it&#x27;s actually quite hard, that trolls and astroturfers will modify their behavior in accordance with whatever rules you put up but they are still not commenting in good faith and will tend to derail and dominate conversation.",1444366701

10358261,comment,10357272,10358051,0,0,cpprototypes,,,"If cars and all the oil infrastructure didn&#x27;t exist, EV and batteries are superior.  They have far better efficiency and are a much more elegant solution.  But all the oil infrastructure does exist and is a huge advantage for oil producing solutions.  Consider asking a random person, would you rather keep your current car and use oil that has a side benefit of being carbon neutral or throw away the car, buy a brand new EV, and all the other associated costs (like upgrading the electric sockets in the garage).  I think most would keep their car.  And for someone living in an apartment without a personal garage, it&#x27;s not even an option.<p>If we someday convert our deserts into massive solar energy farms, it may not even matter much that the oil technology is less efficient.  There would be so much excess energy during daytime, the greater efficiency of EV wouldn&#x27;t be a big advantage.<p>And gas engine technology itself isn&#x27;t standing still.  The traditional ICE engine efficiency of 25% is pathetic compared to the EV 80%.  But the Prius combines both technologies and gets 40% thermal efficiency which is a big improvement.  It&#x27;s possible this could be increased further with more improvements in hybrid technology.<p>Many think that hybrids and plug-in hybrids are a bridge technology to a pure EV future.  But the future may end up being a lot more similar to the present than expected.  Maybe the typical car purchase in the future will be a 100 mpg hybrid with 60 mile plug-in battery range as an option.  Those who have personal garages would buy the option, those who don&#x27;t would not.  And it would be all powered by massive solar power farms in the Mojave desert and wind farms in the mid-west.  And the output from all this would be electricity and carbon neutral oil.",1444366635
10358260,comment,10355508,10355508,0,0,Uptrenda,,,"I&#x27;ve never seen a more FUD headline than that. Got to love the journalistic sensationalism at play here.<p>To clear this up: the technique in the article is literally what we use in unit tests to check that our TX-based event code won&#x27;t break under malleability. It&#x27;s something that Bitcoin developers have been writing code around forever (and warning about just as long.) So truly: if there&#x27;s anyone out there still writing code that assumes static TXIDs they really do deserve what&#x27;s coming to them.<p>As I see it: the attack reaches critical mayhem in a similar way to accepting zero-conf transactions in that what you have is a consensus problem. The specific fix for TX malleability is to watch transactions based on their meaning, not their TXID (in this case &quot;meaning&quot; is looking at the inputs, outputs, version, timelock, etc to produce equivalent transactions.) And of course: don&#x27;t accept zero-confirmation transactions.<p>Here&#x27;s some of my ultra-1337 Python code for producing the &quot;attack&quot; just for laughs:<p>def mutate_tx(tx_hex):<p><pre><code>    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    Mutates a raw transaction using TX malleability in the scriptSig (specifically, the OP codes.) This function shouldn&#x27;t be used beyond testing as it uses an ugly eval() hack.

    https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability
    &quot;&quot;&quot;
    tx = CTransaction.deserialize(binascii.unhexlify(tx_hex))
    script_sig = repr(tx.vin[0].scriptSig)[9:]
    script_sig = eval(&quot;CScript([OP_1, OP_DROP, &quot; + script_sig)
    tx.vin[0].scriptSig = script_sig
    return b2x(tx.serialize())
</code></pre>
As you can see, there&#x27;s nothing to it. Just a clueless attention whore claiming to an even more clueless journalist that he can break Bitcoin.",1444366571

CNET, which is owned by CBS, is the publisher of this news site. [1]<p>Here is information on youtube-mp3.org [2].<p>Please do see my other post [3].<p>I want to make it very clear - I do NOT agree with the rulings and RIAA bullying. If you want to be upset at someone - call your representatives and ask them to start passing laws that are in favor of scraping.<p>As an aside note - to expand on my original post. Emulators are not illegal by definition (unless they circumvent/bypass encryption - but that&#x27;s a whole other ball of wax), downloading a free or open source community made ROM for the emulator is not illegal. It is, however, illegal to download a ROM for a copyrighted game. Now, Nintendo isn&#x27;t going to come after you for playing an old NES game in the privacy of your home - it&#x27;s still illegal but they aren&#x27;t going to expend the legal resources and the amount of bad PR to make an example out of you. They may and probably will come after you if you sell or distribute said ROMS.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/riaa-to-cnet-follow-google-nix-video-to-mp3-conversions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/riaa-to-cnet-follow-google-nix-vide...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-mp3-fights-google-with-lawyers-and-220k-signature-petition-120703/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://torrentfreak.com/youtube-mp3-fights-google-with-lawy...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10355992"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10355992</a>",1444366570

When a down server comes back again, it restarts the movement of all parts that used to reside there before the failure.<p>This may hamper delivery of data parts upon restore request in case some parts reside on the down server. However, the parts of the saved file is always duplicated on the client before they are directed to the servers. Thus, if enough servers are still up, the restore request may still fetch copies that are still on the up servers, and which path back to the base also goes through the up servers.<p>Again, currently copies of the same data part travel independently and randomly. In the worst case scenario it may happen that all of them end up on the down server, or that for all of them the path back to their base server has a down server. This however, seems unlikely if there is enough copies and up servers.<p>Also, when a server decides to push a data part onto another server, it only does it onto a server that is up. All servers maintain keep-alive heartbeats with the members of their clusters, so they know which cluster servers are up and which are down. Of course, it may happen a server goes down in the middle of a data piece transmission. In this case, if it is the source server, it will restart transmission upon its own restart. If it is the target server, the source server will receive a timeout  or an exception, and will re-transmit the same part later to an online server (might even be the same target server that went down in case it had come back again).",1444365389

And they&#x27;ll be hit by trolls as well.<p>Wanting to treat it like software and market economy in such a situation makes sense.

Further, the countries which tend to spend the largest percentages of their GDP on military spending tend to be countries with low stability, high chances of conflict with neighboring countries, and a large reliance on outside involvement to maintain some semblance of stability.<p>Entitlements, by definition, are paid for by the recipients in some way, and are often capped by how much the individual paid into the system. At times when the entitlements are especially needed, these limits are sometimes waived or modified, which is one source of entitlement problems. Another source of entitlement problems comes when there is less need for those entitlements and government is attracted by the large amounts of money going into those entitlements. The US (and much of the west) happens to be in a long period when there has been great need which also happens to have followed a very long period when there was very little need. So, most of the money was stolen to pay the bills for everything else in the 90s and the early years of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, then anything left in the markets was destroyed by the economic situations which followed, and eventually the entitlement systems will no longer be able to meet the demands placed upon them. Add the Baby Boomers to the Social Security system with a heavier reliance on it for retirement income (thanks to the near elimination of corporate retirement when they decided the massive amounts of cash on their books waiting for Baby Boomers to start collecting looked bad for their bottom line), and I&#x27;m sure the outlook is just wonderful for my chances of ever collecting the money I&#x27;ve put into any number of entitlements, unless I find myself in the most miserable situation of my life before the government finds a way to cut every last remnant of the safety net.",1444364802

For the life of me I cannot find it now, but there is a fascinating article (by a well-known sci-fi author, I think... William Gibson? Neal Stephenson?) about Shanzhai, aspects of which TFA alludes to. It gives very good insights into the pros and cons of the culture of sharing that underlies today&#x27;s Chinese tech industry. While one of the pros was the dizzying array of remixes it produces, one of the cons was that it essentially removes the incentive to invest in expensive R&D. While China is very good at the former, the West is still where the latter happens, and I tend to attribute this to the different cultural attitudes regarding IP.<p>Regarding the references to fair use and reverse engineering, there may be a lot of FUD out there and TFA helps in dispelling some of that, but there is no shortage of reversing in industry today. Companies regularly reverse their competitors&#x27; products, either to ferret out technical secrets or to detect infringement of their own IP. IANAL, but with few exceptions (like those clauses in the DMCA regarding DRM-related mechanisms), IP laws do not forbid prevent reverse engineering <i>per se</i>.

You would need atleast 14 times the hour capacity just to smooth the daily curve. [In winter there is less sunlight hours and maximum sun light is mid-day.]
The cost is more than 0.1$ per watt hour of capacity, just for battery, and not for any power electronics going with it.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rechargeable_battery</a><p>So this alone would increase your cost estimates by 150$<p>And for society you probably want a weeks worth of electricity stored in some form or other to deal with weather differences, and not summer winter difference.  So minimal goal would be 24*7. Or just more than 150 hours.<p>Or that another 1500$ of cost not included in your estimations. 
Now a big thing to realize, in electricity markets where networks are required to take in solar and wind from other players, its not the producer of electricity that bears the cost of that large storage its the utility that buys the electricity from market.<p>Right now it works somewhere along the lines. Lets make 40% efficient fossil fuel plants instead of 60% efficient slowly starting fossil fuel plants, so that we can turn them on and off for covering the difference between intermitted sources and consumption. 
So in reality renewable plants end up just becoming fuel saving devices for fossil fuel plants while reducing fuel efficiency of said plants when they actually are turned on . 
In long run I believe nuclear is way to go if we want to stop global warming. The intermittency problem goes away with it and you can run a grid with 100% nuclear with very little storage because production isn&#x27;t intermittent, and with modern plants you can vary electricity production between 50 and 100%<p>Global warming is accumulating effect, the emissions are just rate of change, and not the temperature difference, and we need to aim pretty close to zero emissions to stop it. [Yes nature takes some of it off from circulation but a lot less than people think because naysayers compare our emissions to winter, summer cycle of plants that cancels itself in yearly basis.]",1444364327

A lifetime relationship with illicit substances is the same. Because of the taboo, nobody in their right mind who is successful, maintains life and family, and appears normal to the world would ever disclose what they do in their personal life and subject themselves to moralistic judgment.

Vim can't handle things like automatic imports and serious refactorings like ""extract method.""<p>• Use packages liberally. Start your project inside `com.mistrq.myproject` and make a good, semantic hierarchy.<p>• Write applications with Guice. Program to interfaces and bind concrete classes at runtime. Dependency injection lets you easily turn a giant, hard-to-comprehend project into manageable chunks.<p>• Be liberal with interfaces. Sure, we had a lot of single implementations for interfaces, but using Guice made it trivial to swap out implementations for experimentation.<p>• Write tests. Use whatever's popular for unit tests right now, and check out EasyMock for amazingly-easy creation of mock objects.",1292815871

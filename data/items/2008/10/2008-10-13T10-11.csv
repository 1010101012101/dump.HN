330936,comment,330749,330841,0,0,marvin,,,"Not a chance. Given diamonds the same price of glass, you can bet that in three months you could buy cheap (and tasteless) diamond jewelry in the same stores you can buy cheap (and tasteless) glass jewelry. Diamonds look better than glass, so why not use the real thing? There will always be markup for good design, but cheap design is cheap. Most diamond pieces would be much cheaper.<p>The instinct of demonstrating class with expensive jewelry will not go away, however. Some other material will take the place of diamond - maybe some alloy of rare metals. Or maybe new luxury brands will arise, with a 30,000% markup on some quality, (well-)designed piece, maybe or maybe not containing diamonds.<p>This is, of course, assuming that diamond reaches the price of glass, which I strongly doubt that it will.<p>Last, in response to the OP, it is not the diamond trade which is the main problem. It is people doing evil things to one another. Just as crushing one monopoly will not end the practice of monopolies, crushing one evil empire will not end the practice of evil empires. Just wait 20 years and some evil trade will pop up in some other place. This focus on one particular phenomenon is counterproductive, because it blinds us to the general principles behind it.",1223894734

330930,comment,330572,330907,0,0,kaens,,,"To be frank, at this point in time when I'm developing for the web, just about the only thing I care about when it comes to what language I'm using is that it's not PHP.<p>I understand why people use PHP, but as someone who has a decent amount of experience with a variety of languages, I really want a language that's designed <i>sanely</i>, especially for things like web-(sites|apps). I'll <i>gladly</i> take a hit on the language-speed side, or on the ease-of-finding-hosting side for the sake of not having to put up with PHPs craziness.<p>Why? For just the reason you pointed out - the vast majority of websites don't get enough traffic to make the language matter. I'd imagine that things like <i>learning how to configure apache and/or a caching tool like memcached</i> would handle most of the performance bottleneck on a site that <i>did</i> get that level of traffic.<p>Seriously - if a language is ""fast"" enough to allow the creation of responsive GUI apps, it's ""fast"" enough for web-apps.",1223893909

In particular, large parts of the housing stock are now worth much less than the owners paid for them, and less than the outstanding value of the mortgages, or the collateralised bonds that have been issued against them.",1223893547

If you are exposing new behaviour you need to consider that it's actually a new version.<p>Either way, if you're exposing Web Services (REST or otherwise), a versioning strategy is a must to consider - even synchronising a change over a handful of consumers is difficult, let alone if you get hundreds or thousands. This type of environment is almost impossible to maintain without a versioning strategy.<p>Aside from the mechanics of versions you need to think about the bigger picture - you have a resource with a lifecycle now - so - how do I tell consumers about the versions that are available? how do I deprecate and decommission versions, and how do I tell the stakeholders in this? how do I test multiple versions? are there any coexistance issues I need to be aware of? etc... etc...",1223892827

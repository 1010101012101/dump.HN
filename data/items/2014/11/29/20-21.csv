8675051,comment,8674471,8674471,0,0,Sakes,,,"This is awesome.  I am hoping to start teaching my kid programming at age 5.  I&#x27;ve been working with him on his reading since he was around 2.  He is 4 now.  He reads pretty well, but amazingly well for a 4 year old.  We are on level 2/3 books at the moment.<p>I was hoping to have taught him basic math skills by now.  But unfortunately I have not had any success with that.  He doesn&#x27;t understand subtraction yet, and his addition still consists mostly of counting.<p>I didn&#x27;t want to push him to hard, because it is more important for me to instill in him a love of learning rather than teach him specifically how to read, or his multiplication tables.  As a result we haven&#x27;t progressed as quickly as I had hoped, but I couldn&#x27;t be more proud of him.<p>The trick I use to get him to read is &quot;no video games until reading is done&quot;.  There are plenty of days where he opts to not read and not play video games.  And there are plenty of days where he reminds me he can&#x27;t play until he reads.",1417294770

8675046,comment,8673462,8674576,0,0,thephyber,,,"> If you can&#x27;t pay your property taxes, you need to move.\nI would argue you are talking in the wrong tense.<p>Detroit has suffered from resident and employer flight for 40 years. About A MILLION people took your advice before you gave it. It has caused a tremendous downward pressure on property values and gutted employee mobility.<p>Those people that are currently living in Detroit who can&#x27;t or can just barely pay their property taxes are unlikely to be able to afford to leave and/or probably have too much hope / faith / pride (the regular irrational actors) to face the hard reality. I would bet that a lower intelligence and/or education level is likely to correlate highly with people who stick around despite the city crumbling around them.<p>Also, if residents can&#x27;t afford to pay $500 to buy their own house at county auction, they also can&#x27;t afford to move and start new somewhere else.  Even if they could manage to leave before foreclosure, that does not absolve them of their obligation to pay property taxes on a property they still own and likely can&#x27;t sell. People that can&#x27;t afford property tax bills likely also have bad credit, which is another impediment to being able to afford a move, rent / buy a new place elsewhere, and even being able to apply for a new job.<p>I would argue that people who can&#x27;t pay this month&#x27;s bills don&#x27;t worry about &quot;long term&quot;. That&#x27;s why there are more short term (&quot;PayDay&quot;) loan centers than there are McDonald&#x27;s restaurants nationwide.<p>Not trying to absolve them of their bad economic sense, just pointing out some likely reasons they haven&#x27;t already moved elsewhere.",1417294717

8675035,comment,8673760,8673760,0,0,iandanforth,,,"The funny thing about this is that there are plenty of people who would call PG mean. He&#x27;s famous for having no filters on his opinions so he&#x27;s at <i>least</i> rude and if he thinks an idea is dumb he doesn&#x27;t just say so, he will usually have an apt analogy as to how dumb it is. He gets away with this by being <i>right</i> more often than not. In contrast Jessica is <i>nice</i>. In fact she&#x27;s super nice. Her criticisms are no less insightful but they are presented with careful (seemingly effortless) social grace.<p>&quot;Mean&quot; though is a very imprecise term. I would much rather he use the phrase &#x27;malice.&#x27; Or even better &#x27;malice&#x27; and &#x27;schadenfreude.&#x27; PG is mean in the way that the weather is mean, it can hurt if you&#x27;re not prepared but it&#x27;s not out to get you. And it&#x27;s likely people interacting with PG are careful not to demonstrate malice or schadenfreude because he is someone they wan&#x27;t to have a good opinion of them.<p>Even given all that though, the basic thesis that successful people are somehow less likely to demonstrate fewer negative valence personality traits is born out by no research I know of.

I believe the only sensible conclusion is that at least one side is lying very unashamedly.<p>So on one side you have a multitude of people at Github, including presumably lawyers, HR people, founders, etc. On the other side, you have one person who has allegedly been wronged.<p>We can&#x27;t know which side is lying, so I won&#x27;t suggest which one is lying, though obviously I have my opinion on the matter. I will however state where that opinion comes from: I know from reading about Github&#x27;s culture that it is a very open culture, which seems to show a deep respect for individuals. Creating this sort of culture doesn&#x27;t happen by accident. It takes a <i>lot</i> of consistent work over a period of years (I know that because I&#x27;m trying to create that sort of culture in my company, and it&#x27;s not easy at all - there are countless reasons to abort and build a standard, closed culture). To me, what is being alleged by the accusing party is not congruent with the kind of character that would build an open culture.<p>Obviously you&#x27;re free to have the opposite opinion, and I respect your right to form your <i>opinion</i> on this matter based on your own beliefs, preconceptions, etc, just as I base my own <i>opinions</i> on my own beliefs and preconceptions.<p>I think it&#x27;s important that this respect is mutual, though, and that we both realise we&#x27;re talking about opinions here, not facts.",1417294330

As long as it doesn&#x27;t need imagery but just normal text with formatting (chapters, bullet points, perhaps code examples, etc.), it&#x27;s much easier to create and keep in version control. It&#x27;s super light, in a text-based format no program will ever have issues with (try the &quot;open&quot; docx format in LibreOffice) and when sending it to others I just attach a pdf export.<p>Markdown as a spec may not be nailed down 100%, but as a practical thing to use it&#x27;s very handy.

What I remember is that IE 5 came out in 1999, and was a significantly better browser than netscape 4, which was my favorite browser at the time. So, netscape had an inferior product. Meanwhile microsoft also decided to bundle IE with windows, for free, on all new PC&#x27;s. So netscape had a worse product <i>and</i> worse user acquisition. If you&#x27;re a startup in that position, what is the logical thing to do? Well, netscape decided the most logical thing was to start a multi-year rewrite of their entire product, with the goal of having an identical UI, but a fresh codebase. IMHO, it is fair to say microsoft helped netscape into the grave, but it is also fair to say netscape did much of the walking.<p>So, from about 2000 until about 2006 IE was the only game in town because there just weren&#x27;t any viable competitors (well, ok, there was opera, but...). Looking around and noticing they didn&#x27;t have competition, microsoft figured they didn&#x27;t need to iterate their product, so they didn&#x27;t.<p>Now, this will sound strange to say now, but IE 6 had the best standards support, in 2001. However, it also had a lot of proprietary features which made things easy to do that were hard to do using W3C standards, which as standards tend to be weren&#x27;t as developer-friendly as they could have been (I still think CSS&#x27;s layout model is a big mistake). Web developers being web developers they couldn&#x27;t resist those features to build stuff quicker, and they ended up building a lot of IE-only sites, which created the legacy which we are still battling today. And that made it very hard for upstart browsers like firefox to gain marketshare.<p>Now, again IMHO, it is fair to say microsoft did nothing to discourage people from using those proprietary features and getting locked into a dead-end platform. However, it is also fair to say you could and can build a standards-compliant codebase which is IE 6 compatible so developers were helping the jailer put on the chains.<p>I think blaming it all on MS is easy but inaccurate. It was a shared blame across netscape, microsoft and the web development community of the early 2000&#x27;s, which ended up in a stagnated browser market from 2000 to 2005/2006.",1417292996

They are too young to have those properties ascribed to them. It is common, however, for children to call each other &quot;mean&quot; while fighting, and it is also common for parents to tell their children &quot;don&#x27;t be mean&quot; (as opposed to &quot;don&#x27;t be a dick&quot;, which is what teenagers tell their friends, or &quot;don&#x27;t do illegal things&quot;, which is what courts tell everybody).

Aside from being incorrect, it would be counter to the commercial interests of YC to write this essay if it were false.<p>To my knowledge, the research you&#x27;re referring to is based on large bureaucratic corporations like banks, in which it pays better to be a shrewd political operative than a skilled practitioner of a craft and a hard-nosed-but-ultimately-well-intentioned innovator and leader.<p>But as this and many other PG writings explain, modern startup culture, at its best, embodies a transition away from that kind of corporate culture.<p>With that in mind, even if it were true that people like Gates and Jobs did mean things 20-30 years ago, it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the optimal way to be in the startup world of today and the foreseeable future.",1417292734

They cared about CSS when Netscape didn&#x27;t (who instead added a ton of proprietary extensions we now hate: the massive pile of presentation styling we now consider a dirge on HTML), and for that the W3C looked upon them very favorably. It also seems hard to blame them for letting IE6 stagnate when they were coming out of the anti-trust lawsuits, the ones where Netscape fought hard to defend their business model--which they lost. Microsoft is not a company that internally works on things because they are mission critical, but because they are fun and motivating to engineers. They backed CSS, invented AJAX, and forced JavaScript to be a multi-vendor standard rather than a competitive advantage of Netscape; they then had the gall to integrate it as an API and use it in their OS (something we now just assume any reasonable development environment will have), because they thought the web was the future. For more information, and some evidence, in case you don&#x27;t remember all of this playing out at the time, I will refer you to this older comment thread :(. The world just isn&#x27;t this black and white: none of these players come off very well; but if you want to measure impact to the <i>world</i> in dollars of agony, Microsoft&#x27;s moves in the world of browser technology don&#x27;t seem all that bad.

8674895,comment,8673462,8674794,0,0,gred,,,"People often criticize &quot;defined benefit plans&quot; like pensions, where the employee is guaranteed a certain pension payment by the employer. This guarantee means that the employer, rather than the the employee, takes on most of the market risk. Employees (via e.g. unions) often push for pension guarantees that are likely to exceed realistic market returns, further increasing risk to the employer (as has happened in many municipalities in the US). Politicians who are here today, gone in 20 years, are sometimes incentivized to provide expanded pension guarantees (to make employees happy today) without adjusting funding (to keep taxpayers happy today).<p>Defined contribution plans like 401(k)s, which have become much more popular in the past 20 or 30 years, move the risk to the employee -- nobody is guaranteeing anything, and your fortunes move with the market. Obviously there are downsides, but one of the big upsides is that it keeps everyone honest by forcing employers to fund plans today as needed (e.g. 401(k) matching is not a hypothetical cost to be faced in 20 years, it&#x27;s something that must be paid out today).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_benefit_pension_plan</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defined_contribution_plan</a>",1417291622
8674894,comment,8673760,8674709,0,0,ams6110,,,"Setting aside the specific ethics or lack of ethics of Uber, any successful &quot;disruptive&quot; business (as most successful startups are, and what many members of this forum seem to be aspiring to be) by definition destroys or at least diminishes the status-quo. It is very rare for a business to tap a truly green field market, where if successful they will not be diverting market share from established players. That is not being &quot;mean.&quot; Uber is not primarily motivated to put traditional taxi companies out of business, or to put taxi drivers on the unemployment roles, though that may be a side effect of what they are trying to accomplish. Uber did not set out with an objective of destroying traditional taxi companies, they set out to provide a better implementation of that service. Calling this &quot;mean&quot; is like calling the winning team in a football game &quot;mean&quot; because they won. Well. That&#x27;s the point. They set out to win the game. And it&#x27;s very unlikely that those on the winning team don&#x27;t have empathy for their counterparts on the losing team, because they have all been there from time to time. The goal is to win. That this means the other team loses is not the goal. It&#x27;s a fine distinction in some cases, but an important one if you are going to start throwing around words like &quot;mean.&quot; Being better than a competitor is not being &quot;mean.&quot;",1417291597

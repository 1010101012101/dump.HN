But more perniciously it is a scheme that will create the infrastructure for government censorship on a broader scale,” said Hockey in a wide-ranging speech on freedom to the Grattan Institute last night.<p>Hockey said that “of course” people wanted to stop unlawful material being viewed on the internet, and that there were appropriate protections that are in place for that. “But I have personal responsibility as a parent,” he added. “If I want to stop my children from viewing other material that I feel is inappropriate then that is my responsibility to do something about it – not that of the government.”<p>“Protecting liberty is about protecting freedoms against both known and future threats. Some may argue that we can surely trust a democratically-elected government in Australia to never try to introduce more wide-spread censorship.

New Horizons will reach Pluto in 5 years.<p>The problem with human spaceflight is that humans are hard to keep alive in space. We need air, food, water, constant exercise (or artificial gravity), and protection from cosmic rays. All of this support equipment has mass. More mass means bigger rockets full of more fuel. The Saturn V only launched three guys to the Moon and it was 110 meters tall. It was practically a skyscraper built to explode in just the right way so that the top floor ended up on the Moon.<p>On the other hand, probes just need a radioisotope thermal generator or solar panels. Not to mention that probes don't mind one-way tickets. And family members don't cry when a probe is lost in an accident.<p>Barring new propulsion technologies (NERVA? Unlikely in this political climate.), humans won't be going anywhere.<p>A pie-in-the-sky solution would be to put a brain in a vat and shoot that into space.

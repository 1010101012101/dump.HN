To date, a total of $426.3 billion has been disbursed under TARP. As of November 30, 2014, cumulative collections under TARP, together with Treasury’s additional proceeds from the sale of non-TARP shares of AIG6, have exceeded total disbursements by $14.0 billion7. Treasury estimates that the combined overall cost of TARP will be approximately $37.5 billion. These estimates assume that the budget for TARP housing programs will be disbursed in full and do not include Treasury’s additional proceeds from its non-TARP AIG shares.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/reports/Documents/November%202014%20Monthly%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/repo...</a><p>Reading the press release is nice, but it does help to actually read the report to Congress.",1419137776

(I luckily had kept the ROM chips when my mom pitched the computer, I was unable to save it all)  Unfortunately things more complicated like Microsoft Basic crashed pretty quickly so there&#x27;s probably still something a little buggy about my 8080A or other hardware emulation.<p>I&#x27;ve also got a reasonable sized collection of cassette tapes, both of interact branded software and of programs my dad wrote in BASIC and Forth.  It shouldn&#x27;t be too hard to extract the data from these but a converter will have to be written (the Interact&#x27;s cassette interface was unique)  It&#x27;s clearly just pulse-width modulated though.  I just need to find the right stack of tools that will convert a .wav to a cleaned-up set of pulse width timings, or write one myself.  Audio/DSP is another category of programming I&#x27;ve never done.<p>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t touched this stuff in about a year since I&#x27;ve been too busy with other stuff.  I probably need a good chunk of uninterrupted time to make much more progress -- the last time I tried I spent a few hours staring at instruction traces from BASIC trying to find out why it was failing and got nowhere.  Maybe over the summer I&#x27;ll have a chance to look at it again.<p>I will leave you with some screenshots for your nostalgia though.  These are taken directly from the emulated RAM.  The band on the right would actually wouldn&#x27;t be shown since it&#x27;s in the horizontal refresh interval -- that&#x27;s why they appear off-center and sometimes with garbage on the side:\n  <a href=""http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/snapshot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/snapshot.png</a>\n  <a href=""http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/basic.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/basic.png</a>\n  <a href=""http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/basic2.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bodyfour.com/interact/basic2.png</a>",1419137192

If people learned to only take notes on as much as they would write otherwise, it seems you&#x27;d get the best of both worlds -- faster note-taking which would allow time for <i>deeper</i> processing.<p>But really, the deeper problem is taking notes at all.

8778962,comment,8777899,8778538,0,0,neilk,,,"Yeah, there&#x27;s this narrative about programmers being born, not made. I have come to believe it is mostly false.<p>First of all, when I was in my early 20s, I loved a lot of things. Writing, music, graphic design. For a time, I defined myself as someone who used to program. When the internet happened, I just dropped back into it. If I had been born in different decades, I most certainly would have done different things.<p>Secondly, I know a number of people in SF who decided to jump on the programming bandwagon since 2011 or so, in the hope that they could remain employable in an increasingly topsy-turvy economic environment. And... they aren&#x27;t bad. Not great, but not terrible either. A friend of mine who couldn&#x27;t write a line of code two years ago cracks jokes about D3.js today. Some of them were women who might have had STEM-ready brains, but were scared off from science by the usual sexism in childhood. But others, as far as I can tell, were pretty average and don&#x27;t have a great aptitude for it. They just learned it, by learning it.<p>My feeling is that, in North America, they just forgot how to teach computer science for a few decades. There&#x27;s an effect some people have found (anecdotally) that computer science starts to skew male when, in a given country, home computers become widely available as gaming machines. So it seems to me, CS departments relied on amateur geeks (usually male) who already knew how to program to be the top students in the class, and explained away the high failure rate (and a very skewed gender ratio) because computer science is just so hard.",1419137052

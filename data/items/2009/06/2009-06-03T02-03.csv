Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.. had all grown in popularity before they were knocked off. Or at least that seems to be the case, unless there were knock-offs that simply were not nearly the same caliber and just never made it past grandpa's blog as far as spreading use.

If you want to see a nice Facebook knock-off, take a look at vkontakte.ru.  THE most popular site among the Russian internet users.  Probably the only thing it's missing is the API, and the fact that it found it's niche with the Russian language.<p>There is something to be said about knock-offs, and that is why there is reason to be concerned about it.

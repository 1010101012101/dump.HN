4940123,comment,4938162,4938722,6,0,nwenzel,,,"Random Forests are interesting because they are designed to make many, many bad decisions that cancel each other out leaving only the good decisions behind.<p>To oversimplify, each of the many, many decision trees is going to do a poor job building a classifier. Each tree only uses a subset of the data and a subset of the features. So, the results of each tree won't generalize well (and may not even do well classifying the data it was trained on). But, for each tree that misclassifies in one direction, another tree will misclassify in the other direction. The theory (which appears to be validated in practice) is that poor decisions cancel each other out but good decisions don't get canceled out.<p>Although, it isn't quite a simple as a ""good"" tree and a ""bad"" tree. All decision trees are bad but there should randomly be good parts in the bad trees. Each tree is going to be ""mostly crap"" (as Jeremy Howard puts it). But ""mostly crap"" means ""a little good."" The crap in one tree cancels out the crap in another tree. The good parts are left behind... and... like magic... you have a good classifier that is fast although somewhat of a black box.<p>Jeremy Howard from Kaggle is a big believer and where most of my knowledge of Decision Tree Ensemble algorithms come from: <a href=""https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/RandomForests"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kaggle.com/wiki/RandomForests</a>",1355871531

4940105,comment,4936701,4939352,3,0,lloeki,,,"> <i>It would be interesting to know if anything older than Fortran 77 is still in active use.</i><p>In active use, that's actually easy, especially in the industrial space (that's why I mentioned <i>distributed</i> as well as active, which gives another metric entirely)<p>Just about a year ago I was tasked with recovering software from a HP1000/RTE machine (driving an industrial oven in a forge), written in a Fortran dating back from before it was properly standardized.<p>We recovered the code through the machine's serial port, with the built in print functionality, which conveniently prepended a header along with the file's content. Together with pyserial at the other end, a few hours of hacking had a laptop listen via a PL2302 serial/USB adapter, parsed the printed header to get filename and a few metadata, and wrote content to the proper location.<p>The harder part was manually moving through directories, and printing the files at 1200 baud, through a terribly laggy and completely burned out 80x23 passive monitor.<p>Headers in the code mentioned it was actually older than me.<p>With a few massaging, the code actually compiled on a recent gfortran (F95!), but hte linking part was entirely different, and many proprietary symbols were missing. We went through the  30 years old documentation and found what we needed to stub them and plan how to act forward. The thing was actually quite close already to Unix and what we find on Linux these days, only much much more primitive. The code contained critical functions whose role was to compute thermal data for automation, according to various (thermodynamic and other) complex and undocumented rules, so I built a detailed plan about possible actions to take, including linking to C wrappers binding the stuff into Python, complete with a prototypal HTML5 visual status feedback of the automation system. That's when I left the project (and the job).",1355871279

4940097,comment,4939577,4939577,9,0,eric-hu,,,"While I'm a web dev and not a Windows coder, this post is a great example of why I come back to HN.<p>> From experience, Ive learned that its always best to fully understand a problem before you fix it. If you just patch over its symptoms but never figure out what the problem really was, it will often come back to haunt you.<p>Philosophical-level statements like this really help me as a dev, since my one of my biggest hurdles is getting traction for even simple 1-2 line refactors that, in my opinion, can simplify code and improve maintainability.  Far too often, I hear ""just get it done"", and I like to be reminded with statements like this of why ""just get it done"" doesn't always result in a better bottom line for the company.<p>>For some reason, I took this concept to heart in a programming sense and have found it is a good rule to code by. My version of the static discipline, adapted for software, is that whenever you are making a modification to a piece of code, you should always leave it in a state of stability equal to or better than how you found it. And preferably the latter.<p>I try to do this where I can too, and again, appreciate the philosophical explanation.  It prepares me to more thoroughly and calmly explain my own work style.<p>The author laments Windows development, and I can only contrast that with my experience on an open source web stack (Ruby on Rails, Backbone.js).  The upside of working with open source is that I can crack open the gem (library) I'm using and investigate the logic myself.  I could fix the bugs or extend the code to do what I want.  That is pretty cool.<p>The downside of working with open source software is that documentation is horrid.  As the author states, man-hours are finite, and people who write OSS typically don't want to spend their finite hours documenting their code.  I just take these as tradeoffs.  It seems like Microsoft invests heavily in documentation, but I guess the author's point is that they can still do better.",1355871147

Take it to it's ultimate end, and you get a device that you can plug in and will perform like your laptop[1], but can still last a day, less fast, in your pocket. Would you prefer not to have this option of 'overpowering'? If you give both devices the exact same task, the more powerful one will use less power. The risk of course is developers-- given all this extra power is available-- may be temptated to write lazily, or include superfluous 'sugar' (OTT animations etc), which could lead to worse battery life than the basic last-gen apps.<p>If you take the cutting edge gaming, then it would seem that you will get less playing time on the go with the tegra4 than the tegra3; there is no way that at full-tilt they use close to the same power.. but it can't be 6x either[2] But there seems to be a growing rift between the 'mobile' games and the cutting edge 3d ones.. perhaps we will see more 'low power/graphics' options available for OTG playing?<p>1. and we are really 'there' with chips like (quad core A15) tegra 4; the dual core A15s in the chromebook are already matching DC atoms.<p>2. you do have to wonder; how many watts can you pack into a smartphone without burning someone's hands off-- so there is a limit, and it can't be too far from today's devices! Having said that, tegra4 may well be tablet targeted anyway? or feature lower clocks in a phone; we don't really know much about it yet.<p>EDIT: also, i really don't think we will see much from the OEMs on this front, unless it becomes an in thing at some point. It is hard to successfully push anything that doesn't have a well understood metric to it (like screen resolution, cores, clock speed) The issue is really one for the SOC guys (samsung, nvidia, qualcomm etc) and CPU designers (ARM, qualcomm, apple); we <i>may</i> see some movement if apple makes good progress and starts to use the fact heavily in marketing.

I'm sure that you will see consolidation as time goes on -- there are absolutely economies of scale to be had when operating networks.",1355868492

There's plenty of examples of things that I feel is uncool, but I can understand it from the business side. A few weeks ago, when people went nuts over the possibility of ads showing up in peoples instagram feeds, I was like, fine. In every single terms of service that I have ever read, that line, ""we reserve the right to alter these terms of use at any time"", appears in some form or another. That is not an end all, and it's not an important distinction. What you alter the terms to still matters, especially on this big of a scale.<p>You make it sound like if they did this and didn't tell anyone about it, just opted everyone in, and started selling off photos. That you'd be ok with this. Not sure where you draw the line, but facebook/instagram finally decided to cross it. Users of products do have rights, and honestly app developers should head this as an important warning/lesson. You should always have a right to protect the interest of your product, but sometimes, when you decide to monetize a service years after its conception, you mess up. Even facebook/instagram can make huge mistakes. Instagram is going to take a gigantic hit from this.",1355868130

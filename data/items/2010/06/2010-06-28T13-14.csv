We went to industry tradeshows, and our sales guys really worked the shows.  We didn't know anyone in the industry, either.  They worked the shows, really got out there to know the people, and worked the people covering the shows (magazines, photographers, etc).  Basically, it was all about networking.<p>2. Advertising in print got us coverage.  We bought ad space which came with a write up in the mag and online.  Is good because it gave us presence.<p>3. Presence is important.  We'd go to trade shows all over the place, and really mingle.  Tradeshows seemed to do well, and was the place for face to face meetings.<p>4. Incentives to get word of mouth advertising.  We would pay commissions to clients who would bring in other people.  It wasn't merely a link to click on.  Rather, it was direct referrals.  ""Hey, here's a guy who could use your services..."" and we'd give him a fair cut.<p>But really, presence was the big thing.  Being out there, being seen, being apart of the environment was big, and really allowed us to get out there.  If you present yourself as a successful company, people assume you are.  Obviously you need to back it up when they sign on, but it's getting them to call you back that is important.<p>Should also stress that most of this was between 2003 and 2006 when we started this and really pushed.",1277733505

1467907,comment,1466288,1467284,0,0,moron4hire,,,"I think this is actually something Microsoft did ""right"" in regards to C#. One of the first things I read on C# back in 2003 was ""C# Programmer's Reference"". It was available directly on MSDN, it was easy to get to, and it was a no-holds-barred, for-experienced-programmers-only, introduction to C#. It didn't go into any philosophical discussion on why you should like C#, why you should like its features, etc., it just assumed ""you're here already, so you must have reasons for being interested, let's just get down to business."" It didn't go into explain ""what are integers"" or ""what are classes"", it just assumed you knew what these common concepts were and explained their specific details as they related to C#. After reading that and working for a while, I then read the technical spec, which filled in the gaps around the edges. I was a competent debugger in a week, a competent developer in a month, and an expert in a year.<p>Mastering the .NET class library took a lot longer, but that is a different issue, and I'm actually rather glad it's a separate issue (but that's a story for another day).<p>With Lisp and Python, I've tried to take a similar approach. Some of the PLT Scheme documentation -- excuse me, it's ""Racket"" now -- was very clean and concise. I also tried concurrently reading the R6RS spec, which was productive, though not quite as much as I wanted. Python, unfortunately, has full-programming-noob intros and a technical spec. The spec isn't bad, but it's difficult to parse down into the most important features. I scan through the tutorials, skipping most of the text evangelizing the language. That seems to work for now, but it's taken a lot more conscious effort on my behalf to stick to it.",1277733212
1467906,comment,1466802,1466802,0,0,ergo98,,,"To reply to the first paragraph of the article-<p>>Earlier this week, CNET ran an article critical of the permission model of the Android Market. Google’s response to the criticism was that “each Android app must get users’ permission to access sensitive information”. While this is technically true, one should not need a PhD in Computer Science to use a smartphone. How is a consumer supposed to know exactly what the permission “act as an account authenticator” means? The CNET opinion piece “Is Google far too much in love with engineering?” is quite relevant here.<p>Is it?<p>Just to be clear, it is my belief that on the iPhone all apps have the run of every bit of functionality provided by the sandbox. Meaning if one app can access contacts, all apps can access contacts. If one app can get your location, all apps can get your location. If one app can pull your contacts and your location and send it to a web service, then all apps can do the same.<p>On Android this isn't the case at all. On install you had to explicitly confirm the required rights.<p>The Android model is a thousand times better, at least assuming they avoid user fatigue where people simply OK anything.<p>It could see improvements for sure, though. For one I'd like to see optional permissions. When I installed Barcode Scanner I was a bit perplexed as to why it asked to access my contact list. Turns out it's because it can create barcodes from contacts. Nonetheless, that should be an optional permission that I could set to yes (checked), no (red x), or ask on demand (cleared), defaulting to ask on demand. It would make me far less nervous about apps that seem to unnecessarily ask for the kitchen sink.",1277733204

1467891,comment,1466456,1466767,0,0,mbrubeck,,,"Patent lawyers working on standards like H.264 actually have incentive to make them cover as <i>little</i> as possible.  Making the claims narrower may reduce the chance of invalidation in any potential dispute.  Meanwhile, the patent needs only to cover exactly what's in the standard in order to participate in the licensing pool.  As long as they match the standard carefully, implementers can't work around the patent while also remaining compliant.<p>Gregory Maxwell points out that this is likely applicable to H.264 and VP8:<p><i>""As we’ve pointed out before, many codec patents are exceptionally easy to work around: They specify every little detail because it makes it _much_ easier to get through the examination but doesn’t harm the patent’s ability to read on the final standard because the standard specifics exactly the patented behaviour...

These people wouldn't use the resources to empower themseves or improve their position - they would mostly blow it for hedonistic pleasures.",1277730074

I find the whole matter very confusing myself, although I've read a lot about it.<p>Yeah, it is a complicated topic. What did you want to know specifically, what were your questions?<p>> So: low interest rates caused the housing bubble. Could you explain how that happened exactly?<p>Low interest rates were a big part of the problem - the price of money got below the cost of inflation. That means borrowing as much as you can is profitable. Let's say your interest rate is 4%, but the rate of inflation is 5%. That means that all things being equal, your rents on a commercial property are increasing faster than you're paying in interest! That doesn't seem like a big difference to a layman, but the gap between 4% and 5% is huge. That's 20% on your money.<p>In that kind of environment, it means if you borrow as much as you can, you turn bigger and bigger profits. This drives housing prices up. It also drives the stock market up. But the assets are artificially high because the money lending rates are artificially low, ie, set by the Federal Reserve. An arbitrage like this would be much less likely to happen over such a long period without the rates being set artificially low for political reasons, to make things look good when they weren't.<p>And then you know the rest of the story after that.<p>For the most straightforward, plain English explanations, I'd recommend Peter Schiff - he was correctly predicting the housing crash almost to the letter and getting mocked on news analysis programs for it. Here's a link to some of his clips from 2006 and 2007:<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I0QN-FYkpw"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I0QN-FYkpw</a><p>He's got some free videos and wrote some books, check the clips above out - he's consistent with that message - and then check more of him out if you want to understand more.<p>If you have any specific questions, I'll try to answer to the best of my ability.",1277730009

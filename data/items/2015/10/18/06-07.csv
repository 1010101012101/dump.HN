10407444,comment,10405143,10406601,0,0,asgard1024,,,"While you are right that standard arithmetic operators are typically polymorphic, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there is another use case. Another example I had in my head was little and big endian integers, or binary and decimal integers. A language where arithmetic operators are not polymorphic is for example assembler.<p>What I would say perhaps is that #2 and #3 are in a way complementary. In 2, we describe a common operation with a more abstract type, while in 3, we describe the specific representation with a more concrete type. So both #2 and #3 address issues of naming things on different levels of abstraction, which aren&#x27;t directly related to the program specification or its correctness (use #1).",1445151493

The balance wheel is manually tuned to oscillate at a specific rate, releasing the stored energy one little beat at a time.<p>You are right that a mechanical system like that isn&#x27;t perfect. You will get a kick out of a thing called a &quot;Tourbillon&quot; if you look that up - it was an attempt to improve the accuracy of mechanical movements by having the entire movement rotate as it unwound, in the hope of mitigating the effect of gravity on the accuracy of the watch over the course of the day.",1445151378

10407436,comment,10407244,10407244,0,0,lpage,,,"Many aspects of CV and signal processing in general produce almost magical results. It&#x27;s a little less magical when you think back to stats examples of fitting a curve to some signal + (known) noise process. For linear models, the noise term can get really bad before simple regression won&#x27;t persevere. Least squares in one form or another finds lots of use in image processing.<p>Images are just functions, and almost all of the mathematical techniques that you would use to analyze one domain hold for the other. Certain perturbations such as camera jitter are easier to deal with as &quot;undoing&quot; them is tantamount to assuming some underlying regularity/structure on the signal and filtering accordingly. Others, such as removing an occlusion, are harder. Humans do it well thanks to our power of inference, learned from the litany of visual examples that we take in over the course of a lifetime. It&#x27;s not trivial getting an algorithm to visualize what should have been behind the person who photobombed your insta, but we do it somewhat naturally.<p>For occlusions and finding relationships between partially overlapping scenes, really interesting things are happening with deep learning. For noisy images, techniques continue to improve. Compressed sensing and signal recovery is an active area of research that&#x27;s already paid huge dividends in many fields, especially medical imaging. I can&#x27;t wait to see what becomes possible in the next five years. And, as has been noted - this article is dated. There are already more powerful techniques using deep learning for image super resolution and deblurring.",1445150865

I agree that his compensation is earned - but that sort of support has side effects on both the recipient and the rest of society. When taxes and regulation can be expected to take up the slack, people tend toward individualism and communities wither. Compare the strength of families and communities over the last 100 years. While good government can provide financial assistance, like how communities used to, it rarely provides the human socialization that communities do.",1445148803

So let me clarify.<p>Your ask is for a society where every person is &quot;needed and wanted&quot;. In other words, every person&#x27;s (social) desires/ needs/ wants are to be fulfilled on a consistent basis. Given that Mother Nature is discriminative, this is simply impractical unless every one is forced (ala. communism) to equitably dish out attention/love regardless of the likability/attractiveness of the other person.<p>In response I stated that I&#x27;d rather live in a society where every person was self-sufficiently mirthful. By that I meant - where every person is content/ happy/ delighted on their own company. Everyone exhibits a &quot;cheerful enjoyment of life; an exultation of spirit.&quot;[1] In such a society, people continue to interact with one another as usual - but such interactions would simply be a bonus-fun. There would be no &quot;needs&quot; and &quot;desires&quot; to be fulfilled by establishing a connection/bond with the other person (interactions happen freely without any demands/bonds/expectations; love becomes obsolete).<p>I finished off that comment by effectively saying that the very first step people need to take, to be on the path to being in such a mirthful society, is to acknowledge the role instinctual passions play in those &quot;needs&quot; and &quot;wants&quot; ... such as, for instance, how the underlying passions of nurture/ fear/ desire (regardless of culture) underpin the various social desires/ anxieties of needing-to-belong/ seeking-approval/ fearing-ostracization/ suffering-loneliness (varies somewhat by culture).<p>Therefore, my comment is about first <i>acknowledging</i>, and then <i>minimizing</i> to the point of finally <i>eradicating</i> those desires than satisfying or changing them.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre</a>",1445148491

The Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the nation&#x27;s largest owner of private prisons, has seen its revenue climb by more than 500 percent in the last two decades. And CCA wants to get much, much bigger: Last year, the company made an offer to 48 governors to buy and operate their state-funded prisons. But what made CCA&#x27;s pitch to those governors so audacious and shocking was that it included a so-called occupancy requirement, a clause demanding the state keep those newly privatized prisons at least 90 percent full at all times, regardless of whether crime was rising or falling.<p>> Occupancy requirements, as it turns out, are common practice within the private prison industry. A new report by In the Public Interest, an anti-privatization group, reviewed 62 contracts for private prisons operating around the country at the local and state level. In the Public Interest found that 41 of those contracts included occupancy requirements mandating that local or state government keep those facilities between 80 and 100 percent full. In other words, whether crime is rising or falling, the state must keep those beds full.<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donald-cohen/lockup-quotas-lowcrime-ta_b_3956336.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/donald-cohen/lockup-quotas-low...</a><p>> In 2012, Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), the largest for-profit prison company in the country, sent a letter to 48 state governors offering to buy their public prisons. CCA offered to buy and operate state prisons in exchange for a 20-year contract, which would include a 90 percent occupancy rate guarantee for the entire term. Essentially, the state would have to guarantee that its prison would be 90 percent filled for the next 20 years (a lockup quota), or pay the company for unused prison beds if the number of inmates dipped below 90 percent capacity at any point during the contract term (a &quot;low-crime tax&quot; that essentially penalizes taxpayers when prison incarceration rates fall).<p>I can&#x27;t prove that this is related to the private prison industry. But I&#x27;m not buying for one second the sudden sharp rise was caused by suddenly increased vengefulness, either.

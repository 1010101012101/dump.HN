I bought the top rated laptop from them that fit my specs.  An Acer Aspire Timeline 3810T.  Six months later the screen died.  I went looking and discovered that not only are the Acer Aspires plagued with this issue, but so are many of their other brands.  My mistake for not checking it out more thoroughly and trusting the wisdom of the crowd.<p>Even before the screen went out I was having issues with it.  The screen would blank out any time a little pressure was applied to it.  And the machine overheated pretty readily.  It had a weird keyboard mouse set up that required awkward hand position and the screen wouldn't fold back past an angle that was actually fairly awkward.  Plus it lacked a dvd drive which turned out to be more of a pain than I'd thought it would be.  Overall, it wound up as not a very good value for the cost.  And not reliable at all.  We'll see how it holds up once I get the screen replaced - maybe I just got a faulty screen.<p>My brother got a Lenovo and hasn't had any trouble with it.

1734814,comment,1733114,1733114,0,0,ericabiz,,,"I ran a managed hosting company (dedicated servers and colo) for 6 years.<p>Because of that, I'm pretty picky about where I host.<p>I currently have my sites at ServInt on 2 VPSes (a Signature VPS for my production sites and an Essential VPS for testing my new startup company.)<p>The primary VPS serves about 2,000 pageviews per day with no complaints.<p>My advice, having been in the industry for many years:<p>1) NEVER use shared hosting for a startup company. I would always budget and start with a VPS...even a small one. Shared hosting is likely to fall over at random times and it often fails at the worst times--when you launch a product and get a ton of visitors, for instance.<p>Shared hosting is fine for things like small company blogs, etc. But not for a scalable business.<p>2) Go managed, unless you want to wear a sysadmin hat as well as a developer hat (hint: you probably don't.) I recommend letting the hosting company do updates while you focus on writing code and testing.<p>3) DON'T cheap out! Hosting is not a place to save money. $50/month for a managed VPS is completely reasonable and is well worth the extra $40 over shared hosting if you need to scale. You do not want to have to move your hosting when you're in the middle of a really good run with clients.<p>I picked ServInt because they have been in business since 1995 and they host some pretty large sites. Their reviews are overwhelmingly good and their prices are reasonable. Their support responds quickly. I recently put in a ticket asking for server monitoring to be installed. I know this would have taken 1 hour+ of my time (and I used to admin servers for a living!) They not only responded to the ticket within a few minutes, but had monitoring installed quickly.<p>I cannot stress enough that it is worth the extra money to go with a higher-end hosting solution. Yes, inevitably there will be ""But shared hosting works for me!"" replies. It works...until it doesn't. You get an Alexa top 10,000 site, and even with good caching, your site doesn't work so well with shared hosting--then you have to scramble around and muck with switching providers when you should be working with your new customers and working on your product. That's why I don't even recommend starting with shared.",1285656206

1734810,comment,1734011,1734433,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"To be more specific: lead-acid batteries are dead simple technology. Reliable, provide tons of power, etc. However, they take forever to recharge (about 5x as long as they take to discharge) and they are <i>heavy</i>. You can build an EV by just attaching a motor to an axle and adding enough lead-acid batteries until the thing has a decent range, but you'll create a horrible vehicle by the standards of today's commuter automobiles.<p>And then you've got a vehicle that's mostly batteries and little else and has horrible acceleration and top speed. If you use more modern batteries (NiMH, LiIon) you improve the situation greatly but it's still a troublesome equation. Batteries are heavy, putting enough in a vehicle to give it decent range and performance is a struggle to avoid compromising vehicle comfort and safety. And then if you use advanced materials to make the vehicle lighter then you end up raising the cost significantly.<p>The good news is that technology is catching up. Hybrid technology is maturing and with it plug-in hybrids, fuel-cell vehicles, and entirely battery powered vehicles are becoming feasible, even if a bit on the expensive side. But the even better news is that as more money gets spent on R&D the technology will get better and cheaper, until it's a legitimate competitor to gasoline.<p>The bad news is that currently the concentration of hybrid / electric vehicle development is mis-targeted at small, commuter vehicles (making the small slice smaller, basically) when they really need to target bigger vehicles (long-haul freight, etc, although fortunately there are inroads being made there). The far worse news is that at best all of this is just step 1. Even if suddenly overnight every automobile was replaced with s shiny new electric vehicle all that would mean is that we'd transferred the problem to the base power generation infrastructure, which today is dominated by coal and oil in much of the world.",1285656149

Analytic part : It should not be hard to implement a simple application to generate good figure, pie charts, etc. (much  easier than screen/data reading part)<p>2. Image processing as sole innovation. :
 Application will solely be based on it as prime innovation/challenge, but that is not so bad thing. Other solutions will be based on wi-fi, blue-tooth, usb, etc and they will have their own limitations (configuring, downloading, connecting etc). Ease of use may decide the winner. Only if all fitness equipment manufactrs. join and develop a universal application targetting large number of machine to connect using blue-tooth, wi-fi etc, then it may be better solution. I donot see this thing happening very soon. (span of 5 years, my estimate). In this time, this application (based on image processing), if it can establish itself, it may possibly be hard to replace it. It would have already created customer base for itself.<p>3.

Take forums and wikis for example.  A user is identified as an expert only after contributing to the system.<p>With systems like Quora and Opzi, experts and their knowledge is focused early on. 
This is done formally by participants filling up their profile and expressing their areas of interest.
This is done informally by askers directing questions to other users of the system.<p>Identification of experts early on is really useful because it helps those who desire knowledge to pull that knowledge out of those who have it by initiating contact as opposed to a wiki where those who desire knowledge wait around for those experts to contribute.<p>Asking is a great way to pull knowledge.  It is active as opposed to the passivity of waiting for the required information to just show up.<p>One could possibly add game mechanics to 'encourage' experts to contribute to a wiki or knowledge base.  By why go the roundabout way.  Why not just ask the expert?  I believe most people within an organization would be willing to respond if asked to share.<p>Second, don't underestimate email support.  Lots of knowledge is trapped in email.  If I enter an email thread late, I would need to read a whole email thread to understand the context of the discussion.  And imagine if a responder had deleted the previous email when replying.  The previous thread is lost.  That knowledge is 'lost'.<p>Being able to direct a question using email, collecting the responses and aggregating it on a single page will be very helpful.",1285656039

Some fundamental problems, including such simple things as the physical 3-body problem, don't have analytical solutions. That doesn't mean that approximate solutions solve an approximate problem. Algorithms can be designed to give an approximation to the optimal solution of the problem, which is known to be achievable only through ultimately numerical methods.<p>I don't know whether that is the case here: it is possible that they solve a different problem from the fundamental problem. However, even in that case: if the transformations made to turn the fundamental problem into a more tractable problem are generally applicable, then is there really a difference between solving the fundamental problem and solving the transformed problem?",1285655069

Every company I've worked with that uses a wiki usually has 1 person that has to go in to format and edit pages, because no one else will (or knows how to). Someone gets paid just to make and clean up the documentation. I think Opzi makes it simple for anyone to do that by just asking a question. I can't count how many times I've had to ask someone for info which they had in an email somewhere, and they'd have to dig around for it and forward it to me. Now they could just paste it into the answer section of the question I wrote, and when the next guy needs the same info it's all in one place.

I would like to purchase a new laptop for programming activities and productivity, and I am hoping to consult the experience of the HN community to help me find a decent brand / model of laptop. I'm hoping for something under $800, but that might not be realistic.<p>I'm looking for three things, mainly:
1) Good casing. It needs to be durable. My current laptop is falling apart-- cracked plastic grills, wobbly monitor/lid, worn corners, etc. I also don't need or want useless ports like a 56k modem, ""expansion port 3,"" or a remote.<p>2) Good power usage/long lasting battery. The battery life on my current laptop dropped to 75 minutes after a little over a year. I don't see why a laptop battery can't last 4, 6, 8 hours or more. At a minimum, I need 3 - 4, but I don't want it to go bad after a year again.<p>3) Decent Linux support. I don't want to end up with a laptop that can't use wifi on Linux. I'm not sure if this is still a problem now.<p>My laptop usage is between 6 and 14 hours a day. Light gaming occasionally, but it's not a focus. I need Visual Studio occasionally, but most of my coding (Python, JavaScript, PHP) is done most comfortably in vim. Usually I dual-boot between Windows and Ubuntu on my laptops.<p>Right now, I am leaning toward a non-Mac notebook.

(It decreases 1% every hour counting down from 100%).<p>I didn't notice that yesterday, and it's worth keeping in mind when reading this submission.<p>In my case, it might actually have had the effect of discouraging me from considering the offer, because the price went up since I last checked.

It looks okay visually I think,\n  but it might be easier to ""get lost"" among all comments (since the page\n  becomes very wide).<p>- Re: ""when some comments get lots of replies"", ""does the indentation [become]\n  a problem""?  I think that in such cases, 1) deeply nested comments could be\n  collapsed by default. And 2) popular threads could be made wider.<p>- Re: ""Many blogs sit within a fixed page width"". Yes, this might deter some\n  people from using Debiki (the software).  I'm thinking that this discussion\n  system is intended for people who think that [showing the readers' comments]\n  is much more imporant than the right hand sidebar.  And it's probably (?)\n  well suited for discussion sites / forums.<p>Thanks for ""Good luck"" :-)",1353769157

That said, I'm hoping to get out in front of the curve over the next few months and get a better understanding of what the state-of-the-art is wrt ad tech and really just get a better grasp on the industry and what's expected from potential buyers/advertisers.<p>In iteration one, we've built a solid but familiar and antiquated system - CPM-based media adversting. That's not so terribly difficult. What I'd like to get in front of is the industry parlance for the things we're likely to encounter as we start to built a more sophisticated platform.<p>So - if anyone out there is in ad tech - and if anyone would care to point me to a recent primer on the business of ads, I'd be most grateful. A cursory glance at Google has yielded very little. I think I'm just looking to understand the (seemingly) very large ecosystem of the ad world and find a natural entry point into understanding the key roles and responsibilities.<p>From a newcomer's perspective - there's a dizzying amount of stuff happening: There are the SSP folk, the DSP folk, the Networks and Exchanges - there's CPM, CPC, CPA - there's Fixed-Cost, RTB, and Auction-based models - there's CTC, CTA, DR, etc. - there is Targeting, Retargeting, and Personas. And I'm sure this represents probably 10% of the total surface area.<p>The answer is probably: find someone that has worked in the business for 10 years and ask them to coach you but I'm hoping that one of you has come across some valuable presentations or pdfs that you'd be willing to share to help me start sorting through some of this before I encounter it.<p>Thanks for listening.<p>EDIT: Grammar",1353767802

Your way involves many more lines of code and use of the preprocessor which makes searching through code very difficult. I can easily find all the noncopyable classes by searching for ""noncopyable"". I don't have to worry about someone coming along and screwing up the access modifier at a later date. It is much less likely that someone will misunderstand what the code is trying to do, even if they don't know much about C++ value semantics.<p>Edit: I guess my criticism regarding searching isn't valid here, but I have come to try and avoid the preprocessor as much as possible. I've just been bitten by it too many times.<p><pre><code>  class Noncopyable\n  {\n  private:\n    Noncopyable(const Noncopyable&);\n    Noncopyable& operator(const Noncopyable&);\n  };\n</code></pre>\nThat's pretty much was boost::noncopyable is, and it's the same thing you wrote, but it removes the preprocessor.",1353766351

Javascript does not scale complexity and manipulating DOM elements directly is both error-prone and a lousy programming paradigm.<p>We need something in between that offers a sane development model and deals with the complexity and anachronism of the underlying platform. GWT cross-compilation is an excellent example. It has enabled the painless development of complex Javascript-based web UIs[1], with the tool support of any other software development project. This is what I'm going to look to for the future of web application development, not patchy solutions to the complete mess that is barebones Javascript development.<p>For examples of what I have done with GWT: TeampostgreSQL (<a href=""http://www.teampostgresql.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.teampostgresql.com</a>), a rich PostgreSQL web interface, and my HTML5 game engine (<a href=""http://www.webworks.dk/enginetest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webworks.dk/enginetest</a>).<p>EDIT: By the way, it is only a matter of time until we have complete canvas-based UI libraries, frameworks and tools suites akin to Flex (probably from Adobe, too).

I believe it's near the end of the Home tab in the ribbon, now. Click on it. Go to the Find and Replace tab (probably?). Focus on the Find field. Enter ""|"". Switch to the Replace field. Enter ""e"". Click the Replace All button.

While it's possible that you could have Heroku or EC2 admins do ""bad things"" or have ""unruly neighbors"", it's far more likely you'll introduce flaws via insecure coding practices or by using insecure libraries. If you rely on solid data encryption (at rest and in transit) practices and make the effort to secure credentials properly, you should be fine in either setup. I'd make the dedicated VPS vs ""cloud"" setup based upon need for scalability/etc vs security. You should be able to secure a ""cloud"" config to your needs.<p>For #2 since it seems you're in more a 'privacy' realm than a 'compliance' realm, it may be worth the time to peruse the White House's framework  <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/privacy-final....</a>  from this past Feb (which has links/refs/comparisons-across privacy standards) and then the CSA's Cloud Controls Matrix : <a href=""https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/ccm/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/ccm/</a> : or the whole CSA GRC stack : <a href=""https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/grc-stack/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/research/grc-stack/</a> : which should help you assess which provider/service is right.<p>The prescriptive controls in PCI can help you design your data access & handling strategy, but you have to remember that PCI is highly focused on protecting a sixteen digit number and you'll need to determine what your critical data components are from a privacy perspective to effectively map against PCI or other control frameworks.",1353766216

515788,comment,508033,514975,0,0,froo,,,"> The ""initial pixar deal"" was all Eisner, which got Toy Story and so on, happened before 95, which was before Disney purchased ABC (which is how Iger got to Disney).<p>Yes, which resulted in Pixar having to give up 50% of the revenue for the films in exchange for Distribution... which is what caused all the friction in the beginning. Pixar felt like they were getting screwed.<p>> 2005 Eisner was arguably a disaster. However, 1985 Eisner was a savior and 1995 eisner was a genius.<p>> Disney animation was on life-support when Eisner arrived<p>Actually I think you have your people wrong.<p>You can credit Katzenberg with the success of those various films.<p>Katzenberg headed up the production of those films in the Late 80's/Early 90's that ""saved"" Disney animation. Eisner may have been CEO, but he was mostly concerned with operation of the theme parks.<p>It was around 94/95ish that Katzenberg left Disney (I'm not actually sure of the reason) and that's when you'll notice that shortly after Disney produced animation sucked for the most part.<p>Katzenberg ended up founding Dreamworks with Spielberg and they're doing quite well for themselves.<p>Ever noticed that from 94-08 Disney produced mostly poor animation films? Especially when you consider the great run of films that Disney had from 88 (The Little Mermaid) to 94 (The Lion King)... which funnily enough correlates to Katzenberg's time at Disney.<p>Bolt broke the drought and you can credit that to Lasseter's influence since becoming CCO of Disney Animation in 06 as part of the Pixar/Disney deal<p>Say what you want, but Eisner was ill-equipped to run Disney Animation. He just didn't ""get it""<p>Bob Iger ""gets it"" with animation. I'd say this is partially why Dreamworks will now be distributed through one of Disney's subsidiaries in the future (this deal was done very recently)",1237024485

The narrow sort of thinking, where you're totally focused in on one thing, and the ""juxtapositional"" sort of thinking, where you can hold multiple ideas in mind at the same time.<p>The first type of thinking is associated with high stress environments, and the second type of thinking is associated with productive programming, scientific exploration, learning, etc.  He goes on to explain the many ramifications of this, which are fascinating, IMO.",1239447453

Some  subset of N documents -- and of all interim-draft snapshots of those N documents that are still in existence -- will have to be screened for possible disclosure to the other side. (There are tools for partially automating this, but lawyers and paralegals will still have to individually look at many documents / drafts.)<p>In PG's case, there were 2,886 such snapshot drafts for just one document.<p>Makes me shudder just to think about the legal expense.",1239444434

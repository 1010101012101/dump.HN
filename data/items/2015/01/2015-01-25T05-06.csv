They still use huge kettles, precisely controlled quantities of ingredients, etc.  They also tend to use higher quantities of good, natural ingredients and the like.  SO yes, mass production in and of itself doesn&#x27;t necessarily drive quality.<p>BUT.  The size of the company can.  Very large companies, particularly public but not limited to such, start drifting toward the cheapest product they can get away with while maximizing profit.  That&#x27;s their obligation to share holders after all.  I think the food industry(including beer) is particularly sensitive to this from a quality standpoint.",1422165356

8942158,comment,8940559,8940559,0,0,x0054,,,"Reading a lot of the comments about this story, the takeaway should really be that people prefer different sized devices. I like the size of the iPhone 5. After iPhone 6 came out, I have even considered looking at some of the android devices, but all of them are actually bigger than the 5 as well.<p>That being said, I can see how people can prefer a phone with a bigger screen. Apple makes 3 different sizes of the MacBook, the 11, the 13, and the 15 inch. They also used to carry the 17 inch one, which my dead would have loved, because he is looking for a new laptop with a 17+ screen. All he does is sit&#x27;s with it in his arm chair and listens to music, so portability isn&#x27;t a priority for him. He is currently using a 17 inch Lenovo.<p>In any case, a 4.5 inch, 5 inch, and 5.5 inch iPhone product range is quite reasonable. For the really crazy amongst us, make the iPad Mini and the iPad also phone capable, and sell that to people if they really need to have the biggest phone they can possibly have. There are already data capable iPads, so they have the hardware necessary. Make it work like a phone with headphones, and there you go, it&#x27;s just a software tweak away.<p>The other big problem with the new iPhone 6 line is the ridiculous amount of space that&#x27;s wasted below and above the screen. If you hold the phones side by side, you will realize that the screen from the iPhone 6 can easily fit into the body of he iPhone 5. Apple has really painted themselves into the corner with the home button. Back in the days of the iPhone one they has space for a huge physical home button. But now, not so much. The home button, along with the fingerprint sensor, can be moved to the side of the phone, for use with your thumb or the pointing finger (for left handed people amongst us). This way they can make the 4.5 inch iPhone to be the size of the 4S, the 5 inch iPhone would be the size of the 5S, and the 5.5 inch model can be the size of the current iPhone 6.<p>Problem solved, big screens, small phones, more choice. And..... it will never happen :)",1422164381

8942138,comment,8939328,8939328,0,0,laughfactory,,,"I am the data modeler for an organization which lends to small businesses. In my experience &quot;big data&quot; is all in the eye of the beholder, and it&#x27;s not all about how many gigabytes of data you work with, how wide, or how long it is. The challenges are the same: how to use the data in relevant ways to forward organizational goals. In my case the days isn&#x27;t particularly long in terms of number of rows, but it is exceptionally wide in terms of potential variables. It&#x27;s enough data that I have to spend a reasonable amount of time thinking about the most efficient way to model (statistically) and data mine. The issues are similar to other data oriented jobs I&#x27;ve had: how to determine which variables are relevant, clean and transform the data... And ultimately how to turn a big pile of data into a model which effectively predicts likelihood of charge off if the loan were to be approved. Scintillating stuff, but obscenely difficult. Of course, it&#x27;s harder too because I&#x27;m the only modeler and am fairly inexperienced. My last experience building predictive models was a couple classes in college... Which was also my last experience using R (which I prefer to SAS.<p>To answer your implied question, I&#x27;d recommend picking up ANY size real world data and playing with it. Build statistical models (predictive or otherwise), apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to it, but above all develop a foundation of experience working with real world data. In class in college we used &quot;canned&quot; data sets which were already cleaned, validated, organized, and so forth. This made it unrealistically easy to model. In the real world just working with the data effectively is a hard won skill. So from the get go you need to learn how to explore data, visualize it, interpret plots and statistics, clean/transform/normalize it, formulate a question your data can answer, and apply the relevant methods in pursuit of the answers you seek. Once you have the fundamentals down the size of the data is immaterial--only requiring you to put additional thought into what you can computationally achieve (for instance, how to determine which of 150 candidate variables are statistically relevant).",1422163573

People who bought their houses in 1975 are paying taxes based on what their houses were worth in 1975 times roughly 1.02^40, or 2.2x. In the same period, the median home price went from $41,600 to $478,700, a rise of almost 12x. So, if they moved to an equivalently valuable home, they&#x27;d pay about 5.5x the amount of tax going forward, which can be very significant.<p>Housing prices take into account the amount of taxes one expects to have to pay, so if they&#x27;re no longer locked, and one expects prices to rise, then the price one will be willing to pay will be lower. Also, prices will fall as more supply opens up, since there won&#x27;t be such a big advantage to sitting on houses anymore, and people are more free to move to less expensive areas. Currently there&#x27;s a bit of a rent control situation where the low rates can be passed on to your descendants, and there&#x27;s a big incentive to stay in it rather than selling it and moving farther out, even if the place farther out is half the price. This effect is more pronounced on the high demand areas where prices have risen more.<p>Over time, the prices would adjust and settle. People may end up paying more tax overall, but we can play with the rate, or we could decide that the schools could use more funding (in many places, they could), and that we should keep the rate where it is. As it is now, the people who are just moving to CA are heavily subsidizing people who have lived here for a long time, and the lack of liquid housing supply is causing prices to shoot up.",1422163078

Few drugs are hazardous, let alone effective, at doses well under 1 mg.

Another part is the massive productivity gains of past decades, that also has to go somewhere, and it isn&#x27;t going into rising prices of consumer goods for the most part.<p>To me, it seems logical that the ratio between median housing prices and median wages has to be rather constant over time, and if it isn&#x27;t, there should be a measurable offset somewhere else, <i>especially</i> when the housing is by far the largest purchase 90%+ of people will ever make - yet, I see no proportional offset (of decreased spending) elsewhere.",1422162526

Before everybody starts making the obvious comparisons, note that this is from the same guy that made LZ4, and he is someone who clearly knows what he&#x27;s doing. I&#x27;ve been following his work for some time.<p>It looks like this is the evolution of Zhuff, an experimental (closed-source) compressor [1]. It is basically LZ4 followed by a fast entropy coder, specifically FSE [2], that is a flavor of arithmetic coding that is particularly suited for lookup-table based implementations.<p>From a quick look at the source code it seems that the entropy stage uses 3 probability tables, one for literal bytes, one for match offsets, and one for match lengths. This is not dissimilar from gzip (which however uses Huffman).<p>EDIT: from a second look it seems that the LZ77 compression stage is basically LZ4: it uses a simple hash table with no collision resolution, which offers very high compression speed but poor match search. I&#x27;m surprised he didn&#x27;t implement (yet?) an HC variant as for LZ4, it could even beat gzip compression rate with no overhead in decompression speed/memory requirements.<p>[1] <a href=""http://fastcompression.blogspot.fr/p/zhuff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fastcompression.blogspot.fr/p/zhuff.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy</a>",1422162181

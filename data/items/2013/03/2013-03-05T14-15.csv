5324760,comment,5324100,5324100,20,0,DannoHung,,,"Monads are complicated because the word ""monad"" bears too much weight in any discussion about them.<p>1) There is a category theoretical concept of a monad. This is largely irrelevant in a practical explanation of monads since Monads are usually talked about in terms of another category theoretical concept called the Kleisli Category or Kleisli Triple. However, if someone starts talking about ""monad laws"", they're probably referring to the theoretical sense of this.<p>2) There is, in Haskell at any rate, a typeclass called the Monad (note the capital ""M""). This is mostly important because when a type is an instance of this category, the Haskell do-notation is useful. Aside from that, you can only use the handful of operations that the Monad typeclass implements that you don't have to implement yourself for it to be an instance of Monad.<p>3) There are Monad type constructors, such as Maybe, IO, and State. This is where things actually start getting interesting for the practitioner, because each provides a specific abstraction of a concept, such as input/output or partial functions (IO and Maybe, respectively).<p>4) There are Monad types, both abstract and concrete, like Maybe a, IO a, Maybe Int, State MyType and so on. These are the types you actually will program with.<p>5) There are Monad values, which are instances of the Monad types, which are, themselves, instances of the Monad type constructors, which are instances of the Monad typeclass.<p>6) Then just to add a slightly extra confusing layer on top of it all, you have the values <i>inside</i> the Monad you'll actually be doing computations with.<p>7) And finally, it doesn't help when in code examples, type variables and function variables are conflated by name, such as in:<p><pre><code>    get :: State s s
    get s = (s,s)
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, that's much more clear for an expert than a beginner in regards to what's going on there, so if you're reading code samples, likely written by people with expertise, they're going to be confusing.<p>So, yeah. Simple concept of explicit effects. Seriously semantically overloaded stack of terms to actual reason with them about.",1362495500

5324739,comment,5317734,5318547,2,0,oskarpearson,,,"Any ""bandwidth cost"" being a key part of the cost is likely a red herring.<p>It appears the IP address of the host (163.195.16.73) is owned by the SA government, so they are likely paying for bandwidth, not the contractor that developed the site. In my opinion this probably means bandwidth isn't part of the quoted cost. See <a href=""http://www.afrinic.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.afrinic.net</a> and a DNS lookup for <a href=""http://www.freestateonline.fs.gov.za/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freestateonline.fs.gov.za/</a> - which is a CNAME for iproxy1.openet.gov.za. Of course I've not seen any contracts here or similar, so I could be wrong, but it's certainly how I'd expect the contract to be managed.<p>Regarding high bandwidth costs, the SA government has a significant stake in the monopoly telco provider (Telkom SA - <a href=""http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-corporate-governance/pic-calls-governance-change-at-telkom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.moneyweb.co.za/moneyweb-corporate-governance/pic-...</a> says it's 39.8% government owned).<p>My opinion is that bandwidth costs are high in SA because of the monopoly.

There are some good examples in some countries of Africa, as this one in Kenya: <a href=""http://www.sida.se/English/Countries-and-regions/Africa/Kenya/Programmes-and-projects1/New-technologies-promote-democracy-participation-and-accountability/Facts-Mobile-phones-as-a-tool-for-democracy--texting-for-the-MDGs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sida.se/English/Countries-and-regions/Africa/Keny...</a><p>They are low tech (you don't have to own an iPhone to access an iOS app and report a crime, you just send a SMS), which I think is a great advantage.
If you are able to create a good source of data of previously unreported crime through a good system of anonymous reporting, will help a lot the PD.
In example, in my country lots of small crimes ( e.g. pickpocketing) go unreported because the chances are close to zero of recovering your things or find and punish the thieve. Also, lots of serious crimes (e.g. drug dealing, police abuse, murders) go unreported because people are afraid of retaliation.
You see that I used a real case but I am giving my own ideas here, I hope you can have a use for this. But I really think the universal reach that mobile phones (including the simpler ones) have and the anonymity possibilities can be used to create a system that improves your city's criminal maps.",1362494442

5324670,comment,5323990,5324336,1,0,MereInterest,,,"Yup.  Have some sort of error code that is passed back by A1() or A2().<p><pre><code>  bool A1();
  bool A2();

  void A(){
      bool result = A1();
      if (!result){
          A2();
      }
  }
</code></pre>
Instead of your ""if(corner case) raise();"", you would then have a ""if(corner case) return false;"".<p>However, it becomes more difficult if you want a return value.  Suppose that your A() function was as follows.<p><pre><code>  double A(){
      double result;
      try{
          result = A1();
      catch (e) {
          result = A2();
      }
      return result;
  }
</code></pre>
Then, you are already using the return value to indicate something other than success or failure of the operation.  You could have A1 and A2 return some special value that wouldn't return normally.  For example, if it is some distance, negative values could represent invalid responses.<p><pre><code>  double dist(){
      double output = dist1();
      if (output==-1)
          output = dist2();
      return output;
  }
</code></pre>
However, sometimes any value could be a valid value.  Then you need to pass things by pointer or reference in order to have two outputs, one for the value and one for the success/failure.<p><pre><code>  bool A1(double* output);
  bool A2(double* output);

  double A(){
      double output;
      bool success = A1(&output);
      if (!success)
          A2(&output);
      return output;
  }
</code></pre>
It is in this last case when exceptions start being much cleaner, since they provide a clean way to indicate that the operation has failed.",1362494357

Tesla's cars aren't cheap, but they are affordable, and as a new company having the likes of Top Gear behind what they are doing would have gone a long way towards their marketing.

It will contain the facts about a car, and what we think of its looks and so on, but how well the car actually drives is added on the day. If weve driven it ahead of filming, as we do with most cars, we will also have an idea how it feels to drive.

However, when paying double or triple the price for a new version of an existing product, we expect some improvement in the experience, not potentially crippling and extreme inconvenience. If Tesla hadn't done similar tests in their validation programme as the ones done on Top Gear and then said to themselves ""How could this look bad on Top Gear?"" then they are foolish.<p>I'm not really liking Tesla's approach to PR here, they could be engaging in a much more positive way instead of lashing out at the media.

5324476,comment,5323990,5324345,1,0,mcherm,,,"> He claims exceptions are fast enough.<p>This is going to vary across languages. In cPython for instance (since I happen to know it), exceptions are at least as fast as looping through an iterator, since exiting from a loop is done via exceptions. He included a link to an article showing that exceptions are quite fast on the JVM. I am sure there are other languages where the implementation of exceptions is slow -- in these languages this is a valid objection to using exceptions for flow control. And I don't care how fast the code runs under a debugger. Perhaps you do, but really, I don't; we must have very different use cases.<p>> He claims that it's not hard to understand, but provides no support. [...]  I don't see the advantage - he's doing it differently, but what's the point? What's he winning?<p>It ISN'T hard to understand if used in a consistent way... I don't need any further evidence of that than my own observations. But you are absolutely correct that the argument needs evidence of exceptions being clearer. Perhaps it would help to provide an example of a triple-nested loop with numerous boolean condition variables contrasted with the same loop using exceptions for exit. I don't think exceptions for flow control are more clear in all circumstances, or even in most circumstances, but I believe that they are in some circumstances, especially in cases where substantial work needs to be done in order to determine whether one should proceed: doing the work twice is inefficient, and splitting the function into part-A (everything before the decision point) and part-B (everything after it) can be much less readable than using an exception if part-A sets up variables and data structures used in part-B.<p>> All the way back to dijkstra's article on goto such control flow existed, it just wasn't called the same. And exceptions are essentially non-local goto's.<p>No, I think they are fundamentally different. The problem with GOTO, and with programming before structured programming was invented, was a problem with arbitrary ENTRY points; arbitrary EXIT points do not cause this problem. My more detailed thoughts on this can be found at <a href=""http://mcherm.com/permalinks/1/in-defense-of-the-much-maligned-goto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mcherm.com/permalinks/1/in-defense-of-the-much-malign...</a><p>> Finally, he's doing an end run around the type system.<p>This seems to be a completely new argument and one which wasn't addressed. I am very interested, but somewhat confused. How does the use of exceptions undermine the type system? Is it because the type of the function, instead of being ""Returns an Int"" becomes ""Returns an Int or raises an exception""? If that happens for all functions, how is it confusing? Can you give me an example of how things could go wrong?<p>> In a purely functional language with checked exceptions [...] if you use some nice monadic syntax sugar [...] the distinction between this approach and discriminated unions is very small. [...] why not just use discriminated unions in the first place?<p>I agree, as long as the language syntax supports doing it easily that is the better approach.",1362492246

Do you think you can pull it together faster than IBM (and the dozen other competitors that will spring up once IBMs work becomes more widely known)?  Ideas are worth practically nothing--you have no monopoly on your idea, unless it sucks, and even then, you probably aren't the only person working on it.<p>I ran my previous business for nearly seven years, before throwing in the towel.  It was profitable for about six of those seven years, and it kept me in food and houses...but it wasn't a success, by my definition, and I won't twice make the mistake of continuing a business that I don't believe can win in its market...not just get by, but win.  Perhaps you're not making that mistake, but I'd suggest you change your tactics immediately.  Six years is an awful long time to have nothing to show.",1204775775

You have something that you believe is interesting/useful but the market didn't believe you.  IBM looking into it signals a market change in your favor.  Since that's the case, I say do it.<p>However, it sounds like you need two things (er...people).  A star programmer and a star evangelist.  The first can be had (for a price).  The second is harder to find.  Either you need to become one or you need to hire someone that already is one.<p>Reference: <a href=""http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/06/by_the_numbers_.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/06/by_the_numbers_.html</a>",1204775451

Only one of which was remotely relevant, but not experienced enough to take initiative on this.<p>And since I'm not a programmer, I don't have the experience to provide guidance in that department.<p>I don't know why, but NY is not very start-uppity at all.  People here fantasize about going to work for the IT dept. of Morgan Stanley or something.",1204775334

130281,comment,130234,130260,0,0,wheels,,,"The major points that I'd mention, reacting to what you said are:<p>- It's not as open as it looks.  Once projects grow over a certain size, either formally or informally a lot of the decisions are made behind closed doors.<p>- There's a lot of variety here, from open source startups (Ximian, Canonical), to projects that after many years begin playing in the business field (GNOME, KDE).  Open source startups work more or less like normal startups from what I can tell, except for you know, the code part and a little nominal open-ness.  Big open source projects that started open and move to emulate corporate processes go through a lot of the fallout that happens any time there's an attempt to change established processes in an organization, but it's probably even uglier because the contributors have no particular obligation to stay and often the people pushing through the changes are learning how to do it on a several hundred person organization (which rarely happens in business).  That doesn't mean that there's no real progress, but it's not something I'd want to emulate in a business.<p>- Developers getting into a large OSS project usually learn how to be developers in that project.  Most of them start off comparatively mediocre.  This was certainly true for me, though I didn't realize it at the time.  But usually after a project has been running for a few years they've developed a stunningly hard-core development culture which can take a mediocre hacker and turn him into a wunderkind in six months.  When marketing first shows up on the radar, the guys are similarly mediocre, but they're several years behind the curve on developing a marketing culture and have to deal with a couple hundred hackers and their associated hubris to boot.<p>- Eric S. Raymond is a bozo.  Seriously.<p>And just for reference, this isn't all specifically about the KDE project.  I hang out around enough OSS guys that I've seen the same happen in several projects.  There may have been some that have avoided it.  I can't name any off the top of my head.<p>Edit:  I take that last point back.  I can think of an exception.  The guys that ate my lunch.  :-)  Amarok.  From day one they starting building a community, marketing, worked on bringing people of all sorts into the project.  That impressed me.  (And from the get-go, we've been friends and swap a lot of code, so there's no bad blood.)",1204775238

130278,comment,130205,130268,0,0,NSX2,,,"If I could find some programmers who won't dismiss my value after I've transferred my insights, I'd gladly do it.  But judging from the thinking processes of what I see on posts here ...<p>Just to give an example, a few days ago a ""bored developer"" posted a post saying he was looking for good ideas.  Whenever I see MBA/Financial-types posting on Hacker News looking for programmers, the response is usually, ""Why should I partner with you - what value do you offer since you can't code?""<p>So I asked a simple question on this post:  Suppose I share some ideas with you that you wind up developing.  What do you offer in return? I was hoping maybe an arrangement like ""I'll code on the weekends for your idea if you share an idea I like enough to pursue"" or something.  Instead everybody kept downmodding my post; last time I checked it was in the negative something range.<p>So if I can find people willing to go it on equal terms ...",1204774935

Are they hiring you?  If so, how are you going to like that?  I hated it.<p>If they're NOT going to hire you, what are you going to do next?  It doesn't sound like you'll have enough money to retire, which means you get a job or start something new.<p>You have an incredibly unique opportunity RIGHT NOW.  Many entrepreneurs try multiple times and NEVER make something people want-- you may never do it again (there's a helluva lot of luck involved).<p>So, if I were you, I'd keep growing it unless you think it's a short term play or that it's going to quickly plateau.<p>Even if you ARE going to accept the offer, COUNTER.

130272,comment,130205,130265,0,0,NSX2,,,"If I didn't care I think I would have shrugged it off a long time ago.  Not trying to do it until recently has been more the result of massive amount of change in this area which I found I just barely kept up with.  I just barely got to the point a year ago or so where I had time to reflect and think how this can translate into something useful.<p>So it was more like 6 years observation and thinking in a sort of real-world lab experiment, and only the last year or so of ""apply lessons learned"".<p>But since I'm not a programmer, and most programmers I've come across are working on their own projects, I couldn't figure out exactly how to proceed ... and based on the limited feed back I got, whether it was even worth proceeding or if I was just fooling myself and seeing an oasis.<p>Plus regardless of whether I cared enough, now that I found this out I realize it's a valid thing to more than just me.  So now I care more.  It's just been a long, unrewarding (except the intellectual curiosity part), clumsy, guideless trip so far.<p>My ""adult"" self tells me to give up and move on, or perhaps profit from it by working for ""the man"" ... but then again, what if I wind up 10 years ago in a situation where I say, ""Dammit - I should have tried for just one more year - but instead I gave up and <i>now</i> look what happened - it took off right after I gave up and somebody else is doing it.""",1204774211

This is may not seem important, but universal end-to-end connectivity, coupled with lower-layer abstraction and  transparency, is required for further innovation and deployment of new protocols and applications.<p>Think about the trouble that VoIP protocols (SIP, H323) have when traversing NAT. We invented UPnP NAT Traversal, STUN or some equivalent, all patches for the lack of end-to-end connectivity, hoops that NAT makes us jump through, with no benefit (but added complexity) for the end user.<p>Thus, we can see how NAT can slow and discourage innovation by raising starting cost.<p>The alternative, IPv6, is simpler and solves a host of problems in a single shot. Unfortunately, inertia and fear of change will delay its adoption more than necessary.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_connectivity"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_connectivity</a>",1211667652

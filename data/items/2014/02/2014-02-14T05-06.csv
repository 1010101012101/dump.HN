Traffic laws are laws that &quot;prevent free circulation on public roads&quot;.<p>Communities end up getting some control over what goes on with the roads that pass through them in the form of: speed limits, crossing signs, speed bumps, bike lanes, third party bus stops (as in non-city transit, these do exist), parking spots, etc.<p>While there&#x27;s nothing legally binding yet, communities do exert a degree of control over what goes on around them and they could theoretically block the Google busses.

There are many other types of &quot;goods&quot; out there that can&#x27;t be quantified in dollars and cents. How much is, say, human dignity worth? Child labor? Sadly they both have prices, but I&#x27;d like to think we&#x27;re better than treating people only in terms of their economic value today.</i><p>You&#x27;re confusing &quot;price&quot; for &quot;value&quot;, they are very different things.  The libertarian argument is not necessarily predicated on the market (and not just of commodities and goods, of charities and services, of creative expression, of ideas, etc) being efficient, but the market being <i>moral</i>.<p>The corollary argument is that in <i>most</i> cases government is immoral, hypocritical, and in <i>many</i> cases inefficient at managing all sorts of this wide array of goods. (note the careful choice of qualifiers)<p>The distinction between an anarcho-capitalist and a libertarian, is that a libertarian will outline a specific role of government - generally: to manage situations where force or coercion (specifically, the threat of direct force) are used.  Thich covers &quot;child labor&quot; and certain, non-squishy aspects of &quot;human dignity&quot; like chattel slavery, physical torture, etc.  An anarcho-capitalist thinks that these should also not be entrusted to a single monopolizing entity.",1392357378

7237156,comment,7233001,7236635,1,0,ngpio,,,"When I think &quot;optimal language&quot;, I don&#x27;t think &quot;optimal combination of natural languages&quot;. This is partly because I&#x27;ve been experimenting with constructed languages (conlangs) since the age of eight and partly because my ethical and aesthetic desires lead me to different (or at least more elaborated) goals than &quot;better communication between the peoples of the world as they exist today&quot;.<p>There are many conlangs for various purposes. Esperanto and Interlingua are useful for facilitating communication between people, acting as geography-blind APIs. Lojban is useful for communication between humans and computers, as well as fostering a strict logical mindset similar to the effects of working with programming languages, mathematics or symbolic logic. Klingon, Elvish and many other languages of various semantic/syntactic comprehensiveness are created for aesthetic and/or fictional purposes.<p>I&#x27;ve been working through a new conlang idea in my head the past few days. It builds off of Lojban in that its tenets are (1) universality, and (2) ease of I/O by both humans and machines. But it adds onto that (3) an easy-to-use, potentially unconscious system of real-time abstraction.<p>We do this to some extent with all human-human communication, when we inflect or affect or twitch or sigh or use other non-verbal linguistic cues to impart semantic value onto entire complex utterances. The way that a hyperlink imparts the contents of its destination onto the meaning of the information between its opening and closing tags.<p>This could be significantly sped up through use of more standardized multi-sensory linguistic components, either attached directly to individual people or attached as a metadata layer readable by nearby people through an AR technology of some sort (glasses are the obvious choice, but let&#x27;s not limit ourselves).<p>For instance, a speaker could say the word &quot;lu&quot; multiple times in the same monologue. Those around the speaker would grok the intended meaning of &quot;lu&quot; each time due to whatever technological cues were broadcast along with it. The cues could be a string of words on a HUD or a color tinting the image of the speaker or a soft harmony in the listener&#x27;s ear or a distinct pattern of buzzes from piezo elements in an ankle bracelet or even direct electrical stimulus causing a particular mental state.<p>I&#x27;m getting ahead of myself.<p>The point is that this is the sort of thing I imagine &quot;language optimization&quot; to be. And this example is just scratching the surface of potential optimizations, because any optimization that allows for general abstraction opens up all the doors of Turing completeness.<p>Esperanto and Interlingua are patches. They are certainly useful for some things[1], but we can&#x27;t know <i>what</i> they&#x27;re optimal for unless we&#x27;re also experimenting with entirely new systems not based solely on natural languages. We need to be able to treat real-time language as scripting — anything less and we&#x27;ll be limited by the language rather than by our cognition.<p>[1] Try reading this wikipedia page.

No one is actually happy about the rising costs in San Francisco (aside from current owners of real estate), and I&#x27;ve not met anyone who likes that there&#x27;s effectively a purge going on of lower-income people in the city. Similarly, I think very few people want to ban tech commuters from living in San Francisco and eject the start-ups that already exist here.<p>It&#x27;s a perfectly broken system, because it&#x27;s working exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to: more economically productive people get more access to scarce resources. No one is individually at fault, but there&#x27;s an emergent order that is grotesque.<p>The issue is what should someone upset at this do? The people being priced out obviously can&#x27;t be reskilled to make their labor worth the amount a Googler gets, and the city is, as far as I can tell, incapable of addressing the problem--someone is doubtlessly going to chime in something about rezoning, but it&#x27;s simply wishful thinking to think that constructing a couple thousand extra housing units per year would do anything besides maybe slightly slow the increase of housing costs, which are already too high for most people.<p>Lashing out at the buses is a strategy I&#x27;m not particularly impressed with. At best it might incentivize tech companies to figure out how to solve the problem themselves, but that&#x27;s difficult to see happening, both because it&#x27;s simultaneously a very hard problem to solve and a problem that will resolve itself--in a way neither I nor the protesters will like much--in less than a decade (at least in San Francisco--Oakland and Berkeley probably have a bit more than a decade).<p>I&#x27;ve intellectually played around with some fairly radical strategies and solutions--for instance, a high land value tax that&#x27;s used to fund a basic income for residents--but none of them seem like a slam dunk answer, and all of them can be described, at best, as &quot;maybe not impossible.&quot; But I&#x27;m incredibly eager for any ideas.",1392354231

I call myself a libertarian, but as has been discussed elsewhere, lately, that&#x27;s a pretty broad umbrella -- what I&#x27;ve found in lieu of libertarianism is Constitutionalism, and that despite its flaws, as a system of governance, the Constitution does a pretty good job of setting up exactly what you described - a distributed power system where it is held most strongly closest to the people.<p>That said, it is decidedly <i>not</i> what we have now.  (What I believe are) Abuses of the Interstate Commerce Clause, the General Commerce clause, etc., have set up a VERY top-heavy government, where we&#x27;re in an odd situation that simultaneously allows for states to legalize marijuana while the federal government simultaneously considers them felons.<p>Moreover, I think that the real reason we haven&#x27;t seen any real challenges there is because the federal government has backed off on prosecutions, and I (alert, conspiracy theory) personally believe that it&#x27;s not in the interest of justice that they don&#x27;t prosecute, but because the wrong prosecution could lead to the massive outflux of power from the federal government if the Interstate Commerce Clause is returned to its originalist meaning.",1392354170

A quick search shows that although it might not be directly related to Uber, it is certainly in the ride-sharing space to the tune of $30 million [0].  I am sorry, but whenever someone (not the author personally, but still...) has that much money on the table, it&#x27;s hard not to take what they say with a grain of salt.<p>2) What exactly is meant by the &quot;real world&quot;?  Just because the Internet is not a thing we can touch or see, that does not make it &quot;not real&quot; and thus things that apply to the real world equally apply to things that are on the Internet and vis a vice (which is a nice point the author does make).<p>In either case, I do agree that something needs to be changed and there is something obviously foul with some of the things I have read recently such as that NYC had has gone from 10,000 to ~13,500 Taxi medallions over the past 30 years, which is just bupkis.  Throw that in with the fact that American-born taxi drivers are a rare thing, the average taxi driver makes less than minimum wage and the owners of the medallions make a killing imply something is wrong.

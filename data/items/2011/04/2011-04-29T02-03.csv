I hope you weren't mislead by some attorney that you have to be a lawyer to file a patent.<p>I don't know if you read stuff from Nolo press [1] but we are fortunate that you can get the help you need for filing a patent in Sunnyvale [2] The last time I checked the filing fee was like $1500. You do need to put it in the form required for the application, and you need to respond when the patent examiner sends your patent back with questions.<p>Attorneys are nice, they provide a service which takes a lot of worry out of things and some of them are pretty aggressive at getting the patent issued even if the claims whittle down to something fairly obscure but they do charge by the hour.

2496171,comment,2495818,2495818,1,0,Tiomaidh,,,"Misleading title--if nothing else, it should contain the words ""functional programming"".<p>And IMHO, a very misleading analogy (object-oriented programs : cake recipes :: functional programs : equations). Programming paradigms really have no real-world counterparts, but since we're using a recipe analogy, let's strain it a bit more. I like to think of programs as doers, not tellers, so I'll have them actually employ the recipe, not just provide it.<p>An object-oriented recipe-maker (that is, a cook) will ask you what you want to cook. You say cake. It then looks in the pantry and refrigerator, spies cocoa and flour and eggs, decides a chocolate cake can be made, takes your ingredients and mixes them together, takes readings of the temperature, humidity, air pressure, and altitude to create an optimized heating cycle, plops the batter into the oven, bakes it, and gives you a cake. The next morning, your wife wants to make some pancakes, so she heats up the griddle, gets out a mixing bowl, and opens the cupboard to discover that her flour is half gone. To make her feel better, you give her some cake. She loves it, and wants the next batch to be made just like it. You admit that you don't actually know much about how it was made--just that you asked your program for cake.<p>A functional recipe-maker asks you what you want to cook. You say cake. It keeps staring at you. You allow that you actually want chocolate cake, provide the atmospheric conditions (if you choose to--you can also just tell it that 20 minutes at 350 degrees is fine), and give it some money. It goes to the store, buys the ingredients, mixes them up, bakes it as instructed, and gives you a cake. The next morning, your wife wants to make some pancakes, so she heats up the griddle, gets out a mixing bowl, and opens the cupboard to get out the flour. Later, she's feeling a bit peckish, so she has some cake. She loves it, and wants the next batch to be made just like it. You remember what you told your cook, and know that the cook will always make the <i>exact</i> same cake if you give it the same stuff (cake type, cooking specifics, money for ingredients).<p>Clearly, the functional approach can seem more appealing. But maybe detractors will say that it can be a bit expensive to keep giving out money for ingredients like that. However, a good recipe-maker also manages your ingredients for you. And it doesn't buy flour for pancakes until the moment your wife opens the cupboard to get some, nor does it buy any other ingredient until it's absolutely needed--actually being rather thrifty.<p>Now, as I said, it's a strained analogy. But the one from the article is really not ideal. I also resent the connotations of equations and recipes--the casual reader will say, ""Wah, math is hard. FP sucks. Gimme my objects--anyone can cook."" And while math certainly plays a prominent role in CS, and CS certainly plays a prominent role in programming, math is not always required for normal tasks.",1304045724

2496168,comment,2491908,2496105,1,0,beagle3,,,"> I'd bet a fair amount that your Mass General study used self reported calorie intake.<p>99% of nutrition studies are, but this one wasn't. I can't find the reference now, though.<p>Personally, I've been on a ~1200kcal/day diet for years (for some of that time, I did very detailed tracking), and stayed at my 220lbs. Which, of course, makes no sense, and it didn't to my girlfriend at the time who was an MD - so she decided she'd show me how wrong I am by eating the same as me. She lost weight quickly and started blacking out (apparently some form of malnutrition) within a few days, and stopped after a week with a SEP field resolution (""Contradicts everything I know, so I'm just going to ignore it"").<p>Then, 12 month ago, on essentially the same diet, I started gaining weight - slowly but surely. And then I decided to cut away wheat, and lost 30 pounds within a month. (In retrospect, I also noticed that my gain weight coincided with going from pure-egg protein powder to egg-and-wheat protein powder).<p>There are about a thousand more variables than calories, and the body can change its efficiency.<p>Ignore the rat studies if you like, but cabanac has similar experiments with humans -- basically, people fed through a nose tube lose weight almost independently of the amount of calories you put in their stomach. Body just doesn't use the food unless proper signaling (apparently, scent related) happens.",1304045650
2496167,comment,2494725,2494725,1,0,Groxx,,,"Interesting... I was just coming to the conclusion that such a thing would be handy, as so many things use exceptions as a way of, essentially, returning multiple values.  It's rampant - add an item to a set where it already exists, and it throws.  Which costs a <i>lot</i> compared to returning false due to the stack-unwinding, but is more flexible.  Typically though, the stack-unwinding is entirely unnecessary, the class / message is more than enough to determine the source of the problem.  And such a thing would turn try/catch blocks into a loosely-coupled implicit delegate system, which strikes me as fantastically useful.",1304045608

If pg observed a situation like that, isn't it a bad idea to ""sort through the legitimacy of opinions based on their upvotes""?<p>A link and comment in another recent metadiscussion thread largely sums up the back-and-forth about visible comment scores as a signal on comments in active threads:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2465357</a><p>>> Please bring back the comment scores. It helps a lot in parsing the comments and assigning a proportional weight to each when reading them.<p>> I had to think about this a bit, and I disagree so far. I'm finding that I'm not pre-judging comments as much. It's nice to be able to read someone's comment without knowing first that 70 or 80 or 3 other people thought it was worthwhile.<p>Once I had thought about that a bit, I reached the second conclusion. Readers on HN are gaining more quality comments as readers look at comments according to their inherent value and not upvoting or downvoting based on the crowd appeal of what someone else has already voted. Cognitive scientists have done a lot of research on what is called anchoring bias,<p><a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/anchoring.htm</a><p>and I get the impression, after 892 days as a registered user of HN, that comment upvotes and downvotes for the last year or so have not been based on the same careful consideration of comment quality as they were in the early days of HN, but rather have been based too much on what net karma score is already displayed as people vote. I like the new comment score system of not displaying net comment scores on OTHER people's posts (of course I can still see my own comment scores) better than the previous system. In the spirit of pg's statement, I try to help the quality of HN by actively upvoting thoughtful, helpful comments, and being on the lookout for mean comments (which pg hopes will not be upvoted by anyone) and dumb comments (which surely don't help any users relying on comment scores to learn new facts) for downvoting those. A comment that is both mean and dumb ought to be downvoted, not upvoted. We can all do our part to help the quality of the community.<p>In his thread, pg mentioned comments that are mean or dumb ""that (c) get massively upvoted."" With that condition of HN less than a month ago in mind, how do the highest-voted comments visible in the bestcomments list<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>look to all of you recently? Are there fewer mean comments than before? Are there fewer dumb comments than before? Are the comments that are ""massively upvoted"" since the experiment began mostly comments that are reasonably kind and well-informed, helpful comments on the whole? In most of the treads you visit, do helpful, thoughtful comments seem to rise to a position of prominence, while mean or dumb comments gray out?<p>Remember, pg's claim is that recently HN has not been a place where there is an ""easy way for readers to differentiate the noise,"" but rather a place where the noise has had an attached badge of being signal rather than noise. That isn't good for anyone reading HN. As you correctly point out, we STILL have ""the location on the page,"" which is useful at least for comparing multiple comments at the same reply level as a comment thread develops, and the actual sources and reasoning used by one or another user in supporting points made in comments. People who LOOK UP what the facts are can find out a lot about who is taking care to do good research and who is just making stuff up. And that's always the safest path to learning, to check the sources to verify other people's factual claims.",1304043795

About a day after the first mammoth is brought back from extinction Chinese restaurants (the kind that proudly serve up Snow Tiger, Sea Snake, and Dolphin) are going to be offering tens of thousands of dollars per pound for mammoth meat. The first lab that successfully clones a Mammoth will be able to fund itself for a decade on the first mature animal they slaughter, even if they don&#x27;t.<p>It sounds savage, I know, but this guarantees that the species will actually come back in numbers and for good instead of being a temporary curiosity the way cloned sheep were.

The Z&#x27;s overlay is much more stock Android (GS4 version is TouchWiz only). So I&#x27;ll pick it over Samsung because of that.<p>Basically, I really don&#x27;t like TouchWiz.

It&#x27;s really well designed, especially considering how complex some of the ideas it tackles are.<p>Excited to see how things play out.",1375247056

If you hold a sphere of silicon in your hand, is it one object, or is it 10^25 objects?  Science doesn&#x27;t care, it depends on context, it&#x27;s a semantic issue.<p>The mechanism of willpower-actions, the actual <i>choices</i>, is based on neurons firing and chemical shifts and such.  We don&#x27;t fully understand these mechanisms, but we have a rough idea of how the brain works and any specific hypotheses are completely falsifiable.<p>On top of that, it doesn&#x27;t matter if there is explicit willpower circuitry.  I think by most definitions my muscles don&#x27;t have explicit energy circuitry, but it&#x27;ll still become harder to balance if I&#x27;ve been running or lifting weights extensively.  And the reason is that they&#x27;re low on energy.  For any particular definition of an aspect of &#x27;energy&#x27; I can show you the precise biological mechanisms and give you objective measurements.  It doesn&#x27;t matter that the term &#x27;energy&#x27; is overarching.<p>So, in terms of objective science and provable mechanisms:  Bringing up an argument about whether things are predetermined has <i>nothing</i> to do with whether people make willpower-actions.  It&#x27;s a metaphysical question about whether the actions have meaning.  Science does not care about meaning.<p>Basically, I understand you when you say that metaphysical willpower in the sense of free will is not a falsifiable thing.  But that&#x27;s not what these experiments are about!  These experiments are about the objective side, the measurement side, the willpower-as-defined-by-people-with-heads-outside-of-their-navels, about whether people make the hard choice or the bad choice.  As far as I can tell you&#x27;re claiming the entire thing is trash just because they used the word willpower.  These experiments are talking about a real thing, with partially-understood mechanisms, that are falsifiable in every way except for word choice.<p>The word &#x27;willpower&#x27; is not a specific mechanism that&#x27;s claimed to be in the black box.  It&#x27;s just a description of something the box does.",1375246888

If you go by that method than the iPhone can also never win. But in reality the S4 is a horrible phone (in my opinion of course). I&#x27;ve got one here for development along side the Nexus 4 and HTC One. Out of the branded phones the HTC One is definitely the best. It does the things most people want out of a device very well. The S4 is a mishmash of poorly designed applications and features. Full of gimmicks and awful design decisions.",1375246824

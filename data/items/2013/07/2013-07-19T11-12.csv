6069532,comment,6069371,6069371,6,0,shameless_1,,,"> ... and may still be here but undetectable to our current technologies.<p>I recently saw a nature doc where they were raising Panda cubs. Because the species isn&#x27;t doing that well and breeding in captivity is problematic they try to keep them unfamiliar with humans [0]. Keeping them undomesticated, so to speak. The caretakers wear Panda costumes every time they have to interact with the cubs. They do the same when raising endangered birds: hand puppets reduces imprinting with humans [1].<p>In that respect, I think it&#x27;s overkill for alien tech to rely on advanced tech to make themselves undetectable. Look up at the sky. See those Boeing and Airbus planes? That&#x27;s how easy it is. Disguise your spacecraft as a reflective metal tube that leaves a trail of water vapor and you&#x27;re done.<p>Disclaimer: I don&#x27;t actually believe they&#x27;re among us.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fXBRKWmICU"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fXBRKWmICU</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=XNkV02P8Ysc#t=73s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=XNk...</a>",1374235148

Its not like there&#x27;s much we could to stop them. But the moment they make their existence known, we&#x27;re fucked.<p>At that moment, we aren&#x27;t the world-conquering successful species we love and proclaim to be. We&#x27;re the little tribe living on the little island that&#x27;s quietly being protected by the corrupt government of a minor power in the universal state of nations and empires that we just are now learning about. There&#x27;s a lot of euphemisms in my last few sentences. Figure them out.<p>Leave these people alone.<p>This is kind of in response to your second point. Think about the scale of what we&#x27;re talking about. We have a massively global, interconnected society of both economy and knowledge comprising billions of people. Even the poorest person in the most desolate parts of the world can, with some inconvenience, get on to the Internet. The people on this island, 400-1000 souls that they be, don&#x27;t even have the understanding of modern society that the poorest person in the modern world has. Where do you start with that?<p>So suppose your friendly aliens show up and say &quot;Hi!&quot;. What then? We&#x27;re the people that struggle to maintain ONE space station. We have no extra-terrestrial colonies or establishments. Aliens decide to claim Mars? What are we going to do? The Moon? Its theirs. Pretty much anything outside of our little island Earth is open for claim, and not by us necessarily. The fucked up part is that if you traveled tens or hundreds of light years to get here, Earth itself is probably not the main goal. Its just the natural resources of the system. And what happens in a few hundred years when we decide to get off our asses and go into space? Nothing&#x27;s left, because fucking Zork claimed it all.<p>So when you think about all of this together, what options do you present to these people even if they were interested? Medicine, food? Sure. <i>Maybe</i> we can get them vaccinated before the common cold or bird flu wipes them out. Education? Here&#x27;s some books representing external human history from the perspective of the people supplying the money. Oh, check out our religion too! By the way, did you know that your island is one of several others claimed by India? Its a big island (not really) with over 1 billion people. Too many to count? Don&#x27;t worry, once your 100 kids have moved to Bangalore to become tech support reps and within 20 years your entire culture has died they&#x27;ll be able to explain.<p>I know this is a bit rambly, but hopefully you can see where I&#x27;m going.

The people that make it back speak of a strange society, where everybody is essentially a mindless part of a big mainframe, not unlike the Borg in Star Trek.<p>One day, the aliens make contact. We try to fend them off, but our weapons dont seem to harm them. They explain that their intentions are good, and that by assimilating mankind, we no longer have to deal with hunger, poverty, crime, fear or even death.<p>You like?<p>Absurd, right? Yet this is probably not far from how the Sentinelese see us. They have heard from diseases they cannot fight from other tribes, they have witnessed the abductions. Why should things be different all of the sudden?<p>My point is: we have to stop seeing our culture or civilization as superior. In the alien analogy, becoming a Borg-like drone is probably far better in the eyes of the aliens. Why would these savage humans would want to deal with the perils of life? Why cant they see that were just here to help them?<p>Their culture, their world view is so far apart from ours. Do we really think that, when we show them a modern hospital, theyll think its a good idea? Do we really believe that these people would somehow benefit from things like cell phones, cars, education, healthcare? Besides, we cant show them just the good stuff. We cant NOT show them pollution, taxes, budget crises, alcoholism, child pornography or facebook.<p>Im sure the ones that genuinly want to help these people have good intentions. But the road to hell is paved with good intentions. No matter how good our intentions are, making contact is not in the best interest of these people. They dont need our view of what is civilized, and they dont need our vices and virtues. And they make it pretty clear, too.<p>Leave them alone.",1374233881

My mother ran a bookstore and I didn&#x27;t like doing sales and suggesting additional books. I was never pressed to, but I noticed that other employees could suggest an appropriate related book without pushing the sale.<p>It wasn&#x27;t often that the customer would take it, but because it was appropriately related, they wouldn&#x27;t lose out on the experience, and if they did like it, it was higly positive and a win-win situation.

699980,comment,699787,699787,0,0,jacobolus,,,"While this is nice, I think it somewhat misses the point of Pythonâ€™s careful syntax debates & decision-making process. Yes, it is good to have the flexibility to do cool stuff (and I'm sure there were ways of getting somewhat decorator-like behavior hacked into Python before decorators), but it's even better when there's a standard, readable, clear way to accomplish whatever cool thing. Then whenever someone needs to do whatever-it-is, they can, easily, and anyone else who comes along will know just what they're doing, and not have to read through whatever code works behind the scenes to make it happen.<p>IOW, complete flexibility is not the only end goal: adding predictability as well makes the feature twice as nice. There are many possible syntaxes for doing roughly similar things, but if every app uses a different one, life can be hell for whoever has to read the code.",1247387659

699978,comment,699837,699956,0,0,sho,,,"Yeah, and certainly much cheaper than owning a car in the first place. Being able to carry things is half the reason for having a car, and groceries would be the #1 thing most people carry, I would think. For example, I have a friend who rides a motorcycle, and that's fine for him since he gets anything big delivered.<p>You have more supermarket chains in the UK I think - here there's only two really big ones, but their coverage is pretty much universal. Delivery costs start at $5 and get more expensive as the time window narrows - eg, delivery sometime between 3pm-9pm is $5, between 5pm-9pm is $9, or between 7pm and 9pm is $13. We're not advanced enough to have annual ""plans"" yet though : D",1247387479

Hasn't F# definitively won, except for people who prefer Java libraries (Scala), and people who like lazy computation and/or extreme purity (Haskell)?<p>Yes, F# performance in Mono is bad right now.

699968,comment,699837,699916,0,0,cema,,,"Education means students learning, not teachers teaching. The product of the process of educating is what is inside the students' heads, not what has been said by the teachers. So this is more a question of cultural preferences than that of the money thrown this way or that way.<p>If you want to have a well educated population, get the parents love the process of learning and help them pass this love to their children.",1247386455
699967,comment,699837,699953,0,0,cwan,,,"I should have also qualified my response and thinking in saying that I think that in the US and much of the west this holds true.  In developing countries, often the key barrier for the poor to becoming rich is the lack of strong property rights systems.  There are numerous studies that show the education spending is largely useless or rather suboptimal relative to other interventions in developing countries (see William Easterly's books - he was an economist with the World Bank).<p>Unfortunately I think you're right in that most people don't think hard enough about the issue - but the problem is that most people equate caring with blindly spending money instead of delving into some of the more nuanced issues.  That they do so is often because this blind spending also happens to cater to special interests like teachers unions.  The research on charter and voucher schools for instance is quite promising but just look at the spending that teachers unions have done in those districts that have even considered the ideas.  Again, it's the poor who are the worst off given that the wealth(ier) just send their kids to private schools.",1247386378

I like it (in my experience on toy problems).<p>You mentioned performance vs. usability - Not_found is vague for a reason; it's the way you find out if a key is in a hashtable (no null or Maybe return).  Exceptions without payload are apparently very efficient in Ocaml; they're used often in ""non-exceptional"" cases in the library.",1247386373

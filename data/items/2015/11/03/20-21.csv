When discussing wind and solar the author constantly makes assumptions that favor worst cases, and makes questionable comparisons. For example; stating that &quot;more Americans&quot; died from installing rooftop solar than have died from construction or use of nuclear power, cherry picking the most dangerous possible activity related to solar power (some guy up on his roof, which is a dangerous activity with or without solar panels) to the least dangerous thing about nuclear energy (professional contractors constructing the plants and the plants running normally.)<p>He cites figures when they will be favorable for nuclear or impressive for the point he&#x27;s making, and leaves them out when they would undermine it. He cherry picks American nuclear experience in the examples above because we have so far avoided truly terrible disaster here with regards to nuclear energy. (Three Mile Island wasn&#x27;t good but it wasn&#x27;t Chernobyl or Fukushima.)<p>He also cites figures for the amount of space needed for solar and wind to replace all current forms of power without sources. Never mind the fact that actually replacing all of our power with renewables is something that will take a century or more, nobody&#x27;s talking about completely replacing our entire power generation system in the next few decades with renewables or nuclear.<p>The real question is not &quot;what can replace our whole system today.&quot; because the answer to that is nothing. The real question is, as we expand and replace generators that are being decommissioned, what should they be replaced with?<p>The concerns there people have about nuclear are not about whether it&#x27;s more cost effective than renewables (if all we cared about was cost we&#x27;d keep burning coal, we know we can&#x27;t do that), or whether it&#x27;s safer to build, but what is the long term effect and what are the long term dangers. The long term dangers of a solar farm are basically nothing. You cannot get a Fukushima like disaster out of a solar plant.<p>The pro-nuclear side will tell you &quot;Oh the new reactors are totally safe, you could never have a problem like that.&quot; But they&#x27;ve always said that about nuclear plants. &quot;Oh this new design is safe.&quot; Then a disaster happens and they say &quot;Oh well that was the old design, the new design is safe.&quot;",1446583801

Watching the votes go up and then down makes me think that half of the people do not appreciate my comment. In that case, I feel like I should elaborate.<p>If the phone is in your pocket, then reaching in has two options. One is wrapping your hand around the sides and the other is a pinch on the front + back. With OP&#x27;s button pressing issue, I think it&#x27;s more likely to be wrapping.<p>I personally don&#x27;t see how it would be a problem even with wrapping, unless you&#x27;re used to squeezing hard, but it can be remedied easily by putting the phone in so that the home button is oriented top side. That also brings along the benefits of being unable to unlock quickly and allowing you to listen to music without straining your headphone jack as much.<p>If Apple had kept the home button on the top, there would be more complaints. A top button is hard to reach, especially on the new, taller iPhones. It was already a complaint when the iPhone 5 form factor was released. Having to reach up to lock makes your grip on the phone a bit more tenuous. Combined with exerting a downward force cause you&#x27;re pressing the home button, dropping an iPhone becomes more likely.<p>Frankly, this is the first complaint I&#x27;ve seen directed towards a side power button. For right handed users (sorry, lefties), the button is easily accessible to the thumb now. There&#x27;s less balancing required to lock the phone. I&#x27;ve only seen reviews that were upset at top home buttons on big phones (HTC One series), never ones about side power buttons.",1446583790

Here are just a couple quotes that your post made me think of:<p>>Humanity is now experiencing history&#x27;s most difficult evolutionary transformation. We are moving away from a rooted life-style with a 95-percent rate of illiteracy. We are almost unconsciously drifting away from selfidentity with our ages-long, physically-remote-from-one-another existence as 150 separate, sovereign nations. Now the uprooted humans of all nations are spontaneously deploying into their physically integrated highways and airways and satellite-relayed telephone speakways, into a big-city way-stationed, world-around living system. We may soon be atom-bombed into extinction by the preemptive folly of the political puppet administrators fronting for the exclusively-for-money-making, supranational corporations&#x27; weaponry industry of the now hopelessly bankrupt greatest-weapons-manufacturing nation (the U.S.A.). If not bomb-terminated, we are on our ever swifter way to becoming an omni-integrated, majorly literate, unified Spaceship Earth society. The new human networks&#x27; emergence represents the natural evolutionary expansion into the just completed, thirty-years-in - its-buildings world-embracing, physical communications network. The new reorienting of human networking constitutes the heart-and-mind-pumped flow of life and intellect into the world arteries.<p>-Grunch of Giants (1982)<p>>I&#x27;m going to give you an important kind of a picture. I hear a lot of people say &quot;I don&#x27;t like machinery and technology it&#x27;s making a lot of trouble&quot;, so were going to take all the machinery away from all the countries of the world, all machinery, all the tracks and the wires, and the works and were going to dump it all in the ocean. And you discover that within 6 months, 2 billion people will die of starvation having gone through great pain. So we say &quot;that&#x27;s not a very good idea lets put all the machinery back where it was.&quot; Then, were going to take all the politicians from all the countries around the world and we&#x27;re going to send them on a trip around the sun, and you&#x27;ll find we keep right on eating. And the political barriers now... scientists say very clear you could make the world work and take care of 100% of the people at a higher standard of living that anyone has ever known despite the increasing population, but you cant do it with the barriers, any more than you can try run a human organism with a wall between the ear the eye and the stomach.

Everywhere I look it&#x27;s is relatively homogenous groups, irrespective of the generalized identity of those groups, that actually start something and grow it to significance.<p>For small contrived tasks that will required minimal time to complete, I can see diversity and inclusion being more effective, but when a task is daunting, stressful, challenging, etc. the benefits of a strong in-group with a similar identity provides a foundation for sticking together through trying/difficult times that you would not find in a diverse group with few social ties around identity. Inclusion is valuable, but only when it can be achieved while also mitigating the group from becoming its own worst enemy when diversity of individual interests compete against shared interests.<p>Linus imparts a very very strong and visceral distaste for bad code. These strong opinions attract those that agree and repel those that don&#x27;t agree. It&#x27;s decidedly not inclusion of people who would be tolerant of mediocre code and that is generally a good thing for a critical codebase that is the foundation of so much other code in the world. A group of people that place quality of code at a greater importance over pleasant human interactions is going to produce quality code and sometimes create shitty human interactions. The don&#x27;t package up and ship the shitty human interactions, but they do package up an ship the codebase. Feels like appropriate prioritization to me.<p>Anyways, I&#x27;m not saying inclusion is bad.

10502475,comment,10499539,10499539,0,0,Animats,,,"Classical macroeconomics has some real problems.  These include:<p>- Most models of capitalism are based on trading in goods. This was a reasonable model a century ago, but today, services are much larger in the developed world.  This has tax policy implications - sales and import taxes apply only to goods, not services.<p>- Classical models assume that demand is infinite but capital is limited. For most of history, the problem was making enough stuff. In today&#x27;s economies in the developed world, demand is a scarce resource but capital is not.  The US population is essentially maxed out on buying power, with a low savings rate.  Manufacturers could easily up production of just about anything if they could sell it.  There&#x27;s lots of capital around looking for something which will provide even a few percent reliable return, but few investment opportunities.   This is why tweaking the capital supply, which is all the Fed can do, doesn&#x27;t seem to affect much any more.<p>- Technology has brought an asymmetry to recessions.  In a recession, as demand declines, the least efficient producers drop out first and there are layoffs. Productivity increases.  Now, when the recession is over, the most efficient producers scale up, maintaining the productivity level they had, increasing their market share.  This may be the real cause of the &quot;hysteresis&quot; of which Summers writes.  It&#x27;s also a way in which industries become more concentrated.<p>- Classical economics overestimates the effect of capital and underestimates the effect of technology. Recent work indicates that most economic growth is driven by technology, not capital, and has been since the Industrial Revolution two centuries ago. (Economic growth rate pre-industrial revolution: about 1%-2% per <i>century</i>.)<p>- Classical models of the &quot;free market&quot; assume a large number of players.  That&#x27;s rarely the case today.  One big effect of computerization is that it&#x27;s now possible to run very large organizations, like Amazon, quite well.  Business used to have scaling problems - beyond some size, businesses became harder to run, and couldn&#x27;t get out of their own way.  For most consumer-facing industries, that&#x27;s no longer a problem.  There&#x27;s now a tendency to consolidate as far as antitrust enforcement will allow, which in the US, seems to be down to a duopoly. When the number of competitors is very small, they tend not to compete too hard.<p>- Classical economics assumes labor is mostly direct labor, and that output requires labor inputs.  Today, direct labor is way down, and most labor is indirect labor, leading to change, not direct output.  Online businesses are an extreme case - doing what the business did yesterday requires almost no labor.  Economics doesn&#x27;t really have a handle on this yet.",1446583335

Obviously you can look back through history and find isolated examples of things that <i>kind-of</i> look like rule of law, but the English were the first to do it right.<p>A fun thing to do is to go through different countries you&#x27;re interested in and analyze how much of the rule of law each of them actually implements, rather than just professes to have.

It has two numbers: what you earned as income, and how much you already paid for income tax this year.<p>And it sends you your tax form.  If you earned less than the median annual income for this year, you owe zero.  If you paid anything already, you get all of it back with the enclosed check.<p>If you earned more, you see the result of the automatic calculation, such as tax( income ) = max( income - median_income, 0 ) x tax_rate .  That&#x27;s an easily-calculated, slightly-progressive income tax, with only three computation steps.  If you paid more than what you owe, you get a refund.  Otherwise, you could, at that point, file the forms for additional politically-motivated deductions or credits, or just pay the difference and be done.<p>This has the notable advantage, thanks to using the single, easily-determined statistic of median income, of cutting the number of tax filers in half--specifically the half that would otherwise pay the least amount in tax.  And that half can gleefully vote for the reform!  Them along with the median-plus-one person constitute a simple majority in favor.<p>Anyone can sit down and come up with a better way to collect income tax from the perspective of the tax-payers.  Anyone.  Yes, even that guy.  The problem is that the tax-payer perspective is not a factor when it comes to implementation.  At that point, it is the perspective of the tax-<i>collectors</i> that matters.  And from the perspective of the collectors, a system that offloads all the work onto the payers, and where any mistake at all could generate more tax revenue, is simply perfect.

So in the USA, there are large incentives to not exercise your startup stock options, and on top of it, they typically expire 90 days after quitting.<p>In Canada, when you exercise you pay no tax, but when you liquidate you pay tax on the 0.90 &#x27;gain&#x27;. I don&#x27;t know how the long term / short term capital gains interact in this situation. Capital losses can also deduct fully from your income, so the pain of a startup that goes south is significantly less.<p>I don&#x27;t know the details that well, so what is actual reality could be different.

Religious or otherwise, anytime I see a contract that requires I defer to arbitration my instinct is going to be to assume that it&#x27;s to protect the interests of whoever has created the contract.<p>Happens with employment contracts all the time around sexual harassment and workplace disputes. It&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s unreasonable though. Disputes are common and court is expensive while arbitration is usually cheaper and more efficient.<p>Honestly, the bigger concern is contract signing practices more so than arbitration. I&#x27;m 100% for people or businesses being able to sign a contract with an agreement between them for just about anything, from buying a house to getting married.<p>The problem is the way contracts are presented. &quot;The fine print&quot; is meant to be something huge and intimidating enough that you won&#x27;t take the time to read it. Lawyers are expensive and in most situations you&#x27;re not going to have one read every single contract that you&#x27;re presented with.<p>I went to lease a vehicle a couple of years ago. Talked to the sales person, sat at their desk, filled out a bunch of paperwork, sat and waited while he stepped out of the office to do something with it. After I&#x27;d been waiting for about an hour he comes back in with a huge stack of paperwork for me to sign.<p>At this point a few things can happen:<p>A) I spend 2-3 hours pouring over every one of the documents, asking him specific questions about wording, to which he&#x27;ll call his manager to get an answer, etc potentially dragging on for hours before finally reaching an agreement.<p>B) I ask to have my attorney look at the documents, taken them and leave. He will review them when he gets free and in a couple of days send me his concerns. I will then pass them back along to the sales person who will pass it on to a manager who will either approve or escalate it to their own attorney. At the end of this process, assuming everything can be worked out I will PROBABLY lease the vehicle assuming it&#x27;s still on the lot. I will then get a bill from my attorney.<p>C) I will rush through and sign the documents, trusting the business not to screw me, simply because I&#x27;m tired of waiting and want to get out of there.<p>All of these are a problem and the result is usually C &quot;just sign the damn contract&quot;<p>At some point, we need to establish some legal rules around SIZE of contracts and the strength of those agreements. Under scenario B where each party has an attorney involved and gets the details worked out to exactly the terms everyone is happy with a contract should be borderline ironclad.<p>Under scenario A or C where an attorney wasn&#x27;t involved and the signing process was engineered to produce a signature, significantly more leeway needs to be given to the terms of that contracts and/or the penalties for breaking it.<p>That&#x27;s one of the great things about working in Right to Work states because even the most ironclad of noncompete agreements are basically unenforceable in all but the most specific of circumstances.",1446581625

10502209,comment,10494512,10498107,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>That&#x27;s really not how you&#x27;d write a large idiomatic React application.</i><p>That&#x27;s a bit No True Scotsman for me. Just in the replies to my previous comment, there are several quite clear yet apparently contradictory views expressed about how these things are supposed to work. I doubt that anyone, probably including the React developers themselves, yet has enough experience to sensibly determine what is and isn&#x27;t idiomatic or best practice here. In any case, I&#x27;m far more interested in effective results than dogma, which is why we&#x27;ve been doing practical investigations into what really happens when the tools are used in different ways.<p><i>Conceptually, you should be running render() methods on the actual items which have changed, and a very small number of parent components with little-to-no DOM elements. You should also be executing a relatively small number of shouldComponentUpdate() methods which should be extremely fast to execute.</i><p>And this is where the assumptions started breaking down in our experiment.<p>For one thing, we have a somewhat complicated data model and a somewhat complicated UI to present it. Managing the relevant shouldComponentUpdate mechanisms was getting tedious even in our short term experiment. If you&#x27;re rerendering top-down in a heavily nested UI then it seems you need to provide shouldComponentUpdate in quite a lot of places just to deal with the parent-child relationships with acceptable efficiency, and each of those implementations is a potential source of errors because now you have multiple sources of truth.<p>Also, for things that aren&#x27;t extremely fast to execute because they rely on derived data, you wind up with questions of what intermediate results to cache and where. Caching intermediate results goes against the kind of approach much of the React community seems to advocate, hence props in getInitialState being an antipattern and all that.<p>Time will tell, but once the abstraction started leaking in these kinds of ways, it wasn&#x27;t clear to us that trying to follow the pure, declarative approach that a lot of React advocacy promotes was really better than other strategies.<p><i>If you are doing that, then where exactly was the performance bottleneck, and how was your alternative approach avoiding it?</i><p>Bottlenecks were as above, among others.<p>Avoiding them comes down to the simple principle that if each component attaches to listen to events in a modular way and sets its own state accordingly, then the default is essentially not to rerender anything and has zero overhead. As soon as you start making active decisions about what to rerender, you immediately have the overhead of those decisions to worry about, and sometimes that overhead is significant if you&#x27;re, say, responding to every character typed in a text box.<p>If you respond at a more local level, you can choose the granularity of responses to keep the overheads more controlled, which it seems so far is effectively getting the best of both worlds.<p><i>In fact, it sounds like your second approach might be closer to a normal idiomatic React app than your first implementation. Incidentally, are you using some sort of flux architecture?</i><p>In the sense that user interactions send meaningful messages to an internal component, that component is responsible for updating some stored data accordingly, and the internal component then signals changes that other parts of the UI can respond to, yes, it&#x27;s somewhat like Flux in overall architecture.",1446581365

10502200,comment,10499539,10501255,0,0,laotzu,,,"Alan Watts did a great bit back in the day about money as an information network and how basic income is necessary for automation:<p>>And one of the reasons that our technology is impeded and prevented from feeding the world properly is the failure of one of our networks. It&#x27;s an information network and it&#x27;s called money, about which we have the most unbelievable superstitions and psychological blocks...<p>>Now what happens then when you introduce technology into production? You produce enormous quantities of goods by technological methods but at the same time you put people out of work. You can say, &quot;Oh but it always creates more jobs. There will always be more jobs.&quot; Yes, but lots of them will be futile jobs. They will be jobs making every kind of frippery and unnecessary contraption, and one will also at the same time have to beguile the public into feeling that they need and want these completely unnecessary things that aren&#x27;t even beautiful. And therefore an enormous amount of nonsense employment and busy work, bureaucratic and otherwise, has to be created in order to keep people working, because we believe as good Protestants that the devil finds work for idle hands to do. But the basic principle of the whole thing has been completely overlooked, that the purpose of the machine is to make drudgery unnecessary. And if we don&#x27;t allow it to achieve its purpose we live in a constant state of self-frustration.<p>>So then if a given manufacturer automates his plant and dismisses his labor force and they have to operate on a very much diminished income, (say some sort of dole), the manufacturer suddenly finds that the public does not have the wherewithal to buy his products. And therefore he has invested in this expensive automative machinery to no purpose. And therefore obviously the public has to be provided with the means of purchasing what the machines produce.<p>>People say, &quot;That&#x27;s not fair. Where&#x27;s the money going to come from? Who&#x27;s gonna pay for it?&quot; The answer is the machine. The machine pays for it, because the machine works for the manufacturer and for the community. This is not saying you see that a...this is not the statist or communist idea that you expropriate the manufacture and say you can&#x27;t own and run this factory anymore, it is owned by the government. It is only saying that the government or the people have to be responsible for issuing to themselves sufficient credit to circulate the goods they are producing and have to balance the measuring standard of money with the gross national product. That means that taxation is obsolete - completely obsolete. It ought to go the other way.<p>>Theobald points out that every individual should be assured of a minimum income. Now you see that absolutely horrifies most people. “Say all these wastrels, these people who are out of a job because they&#x27;re really lazy see... ah giving them money?” Yeah, because otherwise the machines can&#x27;t work. They come to a blockage.<p>>This was the situation of the Great Depression when here we were still, in a material sense, a very rich country, with plenty of fields and farms and mines and factories...everything going. But suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo about the economy, about the banking, we were all miserable and poor - starving in the midst of plenty. Just because of a psychological hang-up. And that hang-up is that money is real, and that people ought to suffer in order to get it. But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering. It is ingenuity. You see we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th. And here comes the problem.<p>>So what we have to find out how to do is to change the psychological attitude to money and to wealth and further more to pleasure and further more to the nature of work.<p>-Alan Watts, Money Guilt and the Machine<p><a href=""http://www.scribd.com/doc/202207935/Alan-Watts-Money-Guilt-and-the-Machine#scribd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scribd.com/doc/202207935/Alan-Watts-Money-Guilt-a...</a>",1446581298

While it&#x27;s certainly usable on iOS 9, it feels as an old and underpowered device.<p>If you have powerful computer from 2010, it&#x27;ll happily run Windows 10 and almost any application, including almost any game in medium (or even high) mode. I wonder, whether this race on mobile platform will continue or iPhone 6S will be able to run iOS 15 without any lags?<p>On an unrelated note, I really don&#x27;t understand, why iOS 9 (actually iOS 7+) is so slow on iPhone 4S. I was able to run powerful 3D games on that phone. Like a lot of shaders, triangles, special effects, and so on. This phone actually has good enough GPU. Why simple sliding animation could lag? Why opening &quot;Settings&quot; app takes few seconds? That&#x27;s crazy. Probably there are good technical reasons for that, but I just don&#x27;t understand, what they could be. Sometimes I think that there is intentional performance bottlenecks for old phones, so people would want to buy a new ones. I has the chance to compare iOS 6 and iOS 8/9 on the same phone, and difference is huge.",1446581099

I&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think about it. =)<p>Toc is a proof-of-concept distributed messaging app designed from the ground up to support user data synchronization for use across multiple devices. It uses Telehash for its messaging stack, and is built on top of an Om-inspired architecture oriented around a central app state tree, that gets encrypted using a custom encryption layer for persistence locally, and then synchronized seamlessly between devices using remoteStorage.<p>Originally, Toc started as our group&#x27;s fourth year Computer Engineering design project at the University of Waterloo. After we graduated in May, I wanted to polish it up a bit before releasing, but evidently went a bit overboard and ended up working on it for another six months (albeit with a healthy dose of procrastination sprinkled throughout that period).<p>There&#x27;s a more thorough technical overview and project history on the GitHub page if you&#x27;re interested in more details: <a href=""https://github.com/lewisl9029/toc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lewisl9029/toc</a><p>Toc is only a proof-of-concept, and has a list of awful issues that makes it rather unsuitable for long term general use. However, I&#x27;m hoping that by releasing Toc, we can bring more attention to the awesome technologies for building great decentralized applications that Toc uses, and inspire more developers to take another serious look at building distributed apps, as I hope we have demonstrated with Toc that a decentralized app can in fact have great UX if you design your apps with UX in mind from the start.<p>With that said, I am now officially looking for work. If you have any openings for a ClojureScript frontend project, or a React project that makes heavy use of functional techniques and immutable data, I&#x27;d love to hear about it.

Interestingly, neo-Schumpeterianism (as championed by Perez/Andreesen) seems to be making a comeback.<p>For important phenomena that mainstream academic macro-economics has no explanation for:<p>- How do you measure the &quot;substitution effect&quot; of greater quality at lower prices?  Most standard economics metrics assume that value = price; GDP is the total value of all goods manufactured within a company.  That means that when the price of a computer falls from $2000 to $200, GDP falls.  When Google gives away web search, it counts for nothing; when they reduce the number of organic results to show more ads, it increases GDP.  When open-source Linux replaces proprietary Windows, GDP falls.<p>- Inflation is not uniform.  Inflation in classical macroeconomics is treated as the measured price of a basket of goods, and caused by an increase in the money supply.  But when the money supply increases, that increase does not filter down to all goods equally.  It tends to collect at goods with high bargaining power and few substitutes (Warren Buffett was the first person I know of to note this effect).  So we have seen massive inflation in the valuation of unicorns, and in the price of San Francisco real estate.  We&#x27;ve seen high inflation in health care and the price of a college degree.  We&#x27;ve seen steady inflation in home prices elsewhere.  We&#x27;ve seen severe <i>deflation</i> in competitive consumer goods markets, and in non-unionized wages.  The basket of goods used to calculate CPI is largely commodities, and so by definition tends to understate inflation.  That&#x27;s why the Fed is continuing to step on the gas even though the price of education, or health care, or homeownership is rapidly moving beyond the reach of average Americans.<p>- Competition and capitalism are to some degree antonyms (this is the Peter Thiel thesis).  The first goal of most companies is to build a monopoly and keep competitors out.  This is covered in depth in <i>micro</i>economics, but is largely ignored in <i>macro</i>economics.  But monopolies behave very differently from competitive businesses when it comes to the macroeconomics fundamentals of employment, output, and wages.  Monopolies tend to employ people because <i>they have money and want to eliminate competition</i>, not because <i>they need output</i>; this explains a lot of crazy economics results like why people can work 2 hours/day for six-figure salaries while others work 16 hours/day for minimum wage, or why companies buy startups and then immediately kill their products, or why companies would rather sit on cash than hire more people.<p>All of these are mentioned as footnotes in economics textbooks, but they&#x27;re mentioned to say &quot;Yes, we know this is a problem with the model, but nobody has yet found a better way to account for these phenomena.&quot;  Policy response is still very much dependent upon mainstream macroeconomics models, even though the observed effect of that policy response isn&#x27;t working.",1446580822

It&#x27;s OK if they&#x27;re wrong, so long as there seems to be a rational process involved.

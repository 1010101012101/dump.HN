769578,comment,768784,769113,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"Using someone's APIs may not be considered ""filling an obvious hole"", but it's not unreasonable to assume that a website that focuses on extremely short messages is going to be looking into ways to make that limitation less burdensome, and lengthy hyperlinks are an obvious target.<p>Indeed, anyone using Twitter for more than like 4 tweets is going to realize, ""Gee, it's a pain in the ass that the URL in my tweet takes up half the room, I wish I could shorten it"".  In that light, a URL shortener is an obvious feature for Twitter to implement, since it's so simple (like what, 2 SQL tables and 30 lines of code?).  Similarly, something like cut-and-paste was a likely future iPhone feature, so someone spending months designing an app where cut-and-paste was a major feature was all but begging to get steamrollered by Apple.<p>By contrast, someone who does something like a Twitter match-making service (matching Twitter accounts based on the hashtags or links they tweet) isn't fulfilling an obvious future Twitter feature, and thus is probably safe from being squished by Twitter.",1250560678

Food you make yourself certainly <i>tastes</i> better---most prepared food I've tried has been full of rancid oils and musty, stale flavors.<p>Nevertheless, I'm hesitant to blame prepared foods as a genre.

Internet made information a commodity and there is no shortage of informations, so the basic law of economy learns us that if there is greater supply than demand, then the price goes down.<p>Obviously, not all informations are created equal and some, like niche financial comments (eg, Financial Times on China) are unique, thus worth paying for. Otherwise, what is the point of paying for informations about Michael Jackson's death?<p>Might be we are all beating the dead horse; few generations grew up surrounded by the newspapers and convinced that they provide real insights about the world but it turns out that the actual delivered value is less significant than we thought.<p>There is a lot of valuable content created by people who don't get paid. Actually, I hardly recall when I read a groundbreaking insights from the newspaper; blogs seem to serve the community pretty well.<p>It seems to me to be very similar to programming, actually. A lot of awesome code gets written by voluntarees, without any financial backing; the open source serves, though, as an awesome gateway for providing support or convincing the world that you are a worth hiring programmer.<p>To put it more broadly, because the information alone has no inherent value, to make it financially viable, it has to generate sales directly or indirectly, by building brand for example. And because people have a lot of good will and are creative, there will be also a lot of non-profit content always.<p>Just few random chaotic notes before going to sleep.",1250557917

769506,comment,767943,768133,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"> I wish someone would make optional typing for Lua...<p>I've wondered about this, as well. Adding it would probably greatly increase the size of the language/compiler, though (which goes against its major strength of being easily embeddable), and its not clear to me how it would fit with the underlying VM's design[1]. Just having a runtime-checked type system is quite a bit simpler, until programs get to a certain size.<p>I like inferred statically typed languages, but I think it may work better to leave Lua as-is, and instead focus on making an equally clean-but-pragmatic ML-styled language. H-M type inference, Haskell-style typeclasses, and pattern matching in the core language, but with the same tastefully minimalistic design that Lua has. Lua is (IMHO) an <i>excellent</i> scripting language, but it's still stateful/imperative by default. While OCaml and SML aren't purely functional, their design encourages going that way more than Lua's does, and it changes the semantics of the language considerably. (FWIW, I'm studying Prolog, unification, type systems, etc., and would love to work on such after I get a few more immediate projects finished...)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://luaforge.net/docman/view.php/83/98/ANoFrillsIntroToLua51VMInstructions.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://luaforge.net/docman/view.php/83/98/ANoFrillsIntroToLu...</a>",1250557863

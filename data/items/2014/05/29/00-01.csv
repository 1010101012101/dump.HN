Then people can hold you accountable.<p>Google doesn&#x27;t seem to have done any of that. They made a start in choosing what they&#x27;re going to measure, but I don&#x27;t understand it. For example, I don&#x27;t think &quot;Black&quot; is an ethnicity. The differences between a black South African and someone from Egypt is huge, let alone a third generation American.<p>Also, I notice Google didn&#x27;t include anything about gender in their diversity graphs, and I think everyone believes gender and sexual orientation contribute a valuable difference in perspective. I&#x27;m curious as to why they chose to exclude gay, transgendered, straight, and everyone in between and outside those labels from this push.<p>And then, even if they define all the categories of diversity they want, how the hell do they determine what their targets are for all the different demographics?",1401325124

Perhaps most importantly, demographic diversity is strongly correlated with diversity in points of view. You want the people building your products to come from many walks of life. Remember how Google+ had significant uptake in the rich white tech dude demographic? Not a coincidence. If you want the best people working at your company, you should want a group with similar demographics as the customer population, and if you disagree with that, you either believe there is something inherent about certain groups that makes them better or worse at these jobs, which is plainly bigoted, or you believe that there are external social biases which cause the discrepancies. If the latter is your belief, that&#x27;s all the more reason to work to increase diversity as a corrective to those external social biases. Diversity also impacts the way that people see your company, which makes attracting a diverse pool of qualified candidates easier (few people want to be the only member of a certain demographic group) and is good for public relations.",1401324363

7813919,comment,7812347,7813657,3,0,jjoonathan,,,"> The answer is to invest more in education<p>Suppose that you could snap your fingers and give every person in the United States a college education. Not just a degree, but the knowledge that comes with a degree (a high-quality degree for the sake of argument). What do you think would happen?<p>1. Employers would use the increased leverage to play members of the new labor force off one another until none of them were earning more than minimum wage, if that. By &quot;employers&quot; I mean to include venture capitalists because supply and demand still applies in VCistan -- a flood of entrepreneurs fleeing a crummy labor market means that VCs have all the leverage and can impose similarly crummy terms.<p>2. Enough new positions would appear (either through companies growing their staff or through investment in new companies) that everyone could earn a decent salary.<p>I&#x27;m 90% sure the answer is #1 and that your &quot;solution&quot; would have the effect of &quot;bringing everyone down to nothing.&quot;<p>The supply of labor is fixed (everyone needs to eat) but the demand for it is not (and lower every day in aggregate). It&#x27;s that simple. The game is rigged. In low-growth sectors of the economy, capital concentrates no matter how educated the players are (see: non-CS, non-petrol engineers). Just because <i>we</i> can run fast enough to win a slice in <i>our</i> sector (which is high-growth right now but won&#x27;t be forever) doesn&#x27;t mean that teaching others how to run fast is a strategy that leads to asymptotic success in the limit of teaching everyone how to run.<p>You don&#x27;t have to implement a communist system to shut down the mechanism that rigs the game. BI/MI will suffice. So would some kind of total-employment system. But I see no reason to believe that the supply/demand gap for &quot;average&quot; labor would close for <i>any</i> realistic definition of &quot;average&quot; in a &quot;free&quot; market (I put scare quotes around &quot;free&quot; because Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy ensures that no BI/MI-less market system is ever &quot;free&quot;). If it somehow did happen it would certainly go against the historical trend. Do you have a narrative to explain why the post-educational-revolution employment landscape would be fundamentally different from today or is it all wishful thinking?",1401323717

The question we should be asking is: Why should a smart, hard working, and not particularly nerdy woman want to join the software industry?<p>If you are smart enough, and hard working enough, to get a good job at Google then you can do well in accounting, medicine, law, banking, sales, engineering etc.<p>Outside of a few tech hubs like Silicon Valley software development doesn&#x27;t pay as well, or have as good of a career progression, as other top professions. It is also significantly riskier.<p>On risk: In a startup your job is much less secure and to adjust for this your compensation should be roughly 1.5-2.5x higher than at a more stable firm. Startups <i>don&#x27;t</i> usually pay this much higher which is why, outside of a few select areas, startups struggle to find talent. In SV though most of the risk disappears because the market is so hot. In SV it is easier to change companies than it is to change teams.<p>So already you are saying: If you want to do well you have to give up your existing friendships/family/lifestyle etc and move. Other sectors/fields that require the same sacrifices typically compensate you much better e.g. Go to NYC for finance and realistically if you are good your total comp can be > $1million/year.<p>And that is not even getting into lack of time for l&d, the small half-life of knowledge, working in a heavily male environment, etc.",1401323050

7813827,comment,7812185,7812732,1,0,Dewie,,,"> The apps, written by various persons, are running on a computer that belongs to the user. The operating system keeps control of the computer -- the user&#x27;s computer -- in the user&#x27;s hands, and keeps it from being &quot;taken over&quot; by the apps.<p>I wonder if this can be mitigated - at least in some cases - with more disciplined and limited tools/apps.<p>To my knowledge, there are few programming languages that have purposefully restricted their expressiveness in order to increase how much can be proved about them. Given that &quot;all&quot; of them are as expressive as a programming language can be in the physical world (at least according to researchers&#x27; current knowledge), there are no non-trivial properties that can be proven about them, in the general case. In that sense, it inspires a wild-west approach - the OS can not know anything with certainty about an arbitrary app it has not run yet. So its only option - for an arbitrary program - is to try to run it and try to shield itself from whatever mischief it might do at runtime. Given this inherent and general uncertainty, creating heuristics for programming language/machine code analysis might not be high up on the priority list (if at all).<p>But if expressiveness is limited, there are more properties that can be <i>definitely</i> decided before running the program. Maybe it is possible to prove that a program will never try to access memory outside of whatever is assigned to it? This might be too difficult (in practice) to prove for a low-level language. But there certainly are languages that won&#x27;t let you access memory outside of its process - java, for example, will throw an exception when the index is out of bounds. For example, languages like java could provide a proof to the OS that it will never try to access memory that it does not own? Then maybe the OS could eliminate whatever checks for illegal access of memory, since it has a proof that that kind of thing will not happen.",1401321950

When writing lisp, I&#x27;ve found that you are so constrained in the syntax of lisp, that eventually it almost disappears and you start seeing the language of what it is you are doing, instead.)<p>That said, I think the problem comes down to orthogonal changes.  Simply put, when you have a language that is specifically used for one thing, effort can be placed into making sure it does that very well, at the expense of other things it could be used to do.  Contrast with the languages that are designed to do anything, where you quickly find that in order to really get what you want, you have to write in very different idioms for different goals.

Suffice to say that we&#x27;re in this really awkward in between phase, trapped between a history of clear white majority, and a future of clear heterogenerality - and worse, it&#x27;s a transition taking place unevenly in nearly every respect.",1401321665

Most of whom are not living of anything remotely resembling cash flow.<p>The tech eco system itself is one thing, and largely populated by people who can afford a bit of a hit. But nowadays, everything is priced and organized around ever more millionaires being minted in tech every day, and the spending these generate. Take even some of that away, say by making money less artificially cheap, and there is potential for plenty of pain and dislocation across the area.<p>Much like Finance in NYC, the tech boom/bubble is driving costs so high in the Bay Area, that the only remaining jobs are either in tech, or jobs providing highly paid,  localized and personalized services to tech workers able to afford paying thousands to have their toenails clipped, lips kissed and walls decorated with Van Goghs. Leaving those providing the latter, highly vulnerable to any slowdown in the increasingly monocultural spigot from which almost all funds here now flow.",1401321637

That being said, I don&#x27;t believe what happened to the Mozilla CEO was right. The amount of intolerance that was shown towards him was equally as bad as his own intolerance, perhaps worse.<p>I personally once thought that we should ban gay marriage. As I grew up and gained more understanding about homosexuality my view totally changed. I think we definitely have to give people the chance to change. I would guess that most of the people here on HackerNews grew up thinking that homosexuality was a choice and some sort of perversion. However, I would bet that most of us have changed our views as we have either accepted who we are or have had friends that were gay help our understanding grow.<p>As far as Dr Dre, I had never listened to his music or really followed him in the news. I would probably error on the side of a lot of the other comments, that we should give him a break because it appears that he has changed. My two cents.",1401321624

Our goal was to bring the high voltage as close as possible to the load to minimize IR losses. We could do an efficient AC DC conversion in the rack and then distribute DC to the individual servers but that would mean several feet of low voltage conductors which would be made from large copper bars and a would have higher IR losses.""",1302227819

Getting the performance right should and will come later.<p>I'm a big believer in the mantra ""First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast."" In the distributed systems community, there's a lot of experience with ""making it possible"": Hadoop, Dynamo, etc. Bloom/Bud is attempting to figure out the ""make it beautiful"" part by leveraging what we already understand about the problem domain of building distributed systems.<p>Worrying about the kinds of constant-time performance things you mentioned at this stage would be premature optimization. I commend them for building this system in a language that allows them to iterate fast and experiment. I'm sure in the future they'll look at using technology like JRuby to improve the performance of the project.<p>I think what they're doing is very interesting and potentially groundbreaking -- I can't wait to see where this project goes.",1302227740

Just like the iphone, designers are encouraged to provide 2 sets of art assets, for medium and high resolution screens.<p>The real reasons that apps looks worse on Android is that companies don't want to spend the time and money to get the apps polished.

You don't usually want to do this too much, but doing it in one or two places can simplify code tremendously. This also allows you to eliminate boxing and reflection overhead in a lot of places by letting you use generics to bind to reflected types/members at runtime, which is really important if you're trying to build a performant app in C# that's got extensibility support.<p>For example, I use this to create strongly-typed bindings to individual fields/properties of class instances at runtime, which lets me pass around objects of types like 'BoundMember<int>', and generically store into them - essentially the same as 'ref int', except it can outlive function scope. This is really useful when doing asynchronous programming, and it lets you kill duplication when building things like configuration dialogs.",1302226713

2421992,comment,2420325,2420647,5,0,rhizome,,,"I'd say it's more of a refinement than something new. I haven't looked at much more than what they're saying in the video, but it boils down to:<p>- new featureset mobos: stripped down, no parallel ports among other things I'm sure. there looked to be some SATA/Mini-USB type sockets.\n- fancy new power supplies\n- the triple racks don't seem to be anything special at face value, convenient maybe, but with the power features above two of these triple racks are serviced by one battery rack. So, you'd need, oh, 400+ servers to take full advantage at this level.<p>NOW HOW MUCH WOULD YOU PAY?<p>- Fancy power distribution and cabling and stuff, mostly part of the racks, possibly involving wacky connectors on the compute side. For smaller operations this would be like having a 60-outlet power strip.<p>- 95% efficient from plug to party-time. This helps with the bills.<p>- Using the room/building as the cooling mechanism. While this has likely been done before in some manner (at least an intentional use of stack-effect in HVAC), that weird slot that one of the boxes gets pushed into makes me think they have some kind of sealed thingy from floor to ceiling that interfaces with the racks, basically using the building cooling to push in and suck out air forced through the racks. at a basic level it's all about CFMs, after all. This could also be done with forced current from front to back, or vice versa.<p>whatever is going on here, you first have to get to the ""your own server room"" part of business. this can be had at smaller companies, too, but for the room-cool ducting you'd need to cut into walls and stuff in the server room to pipe that stuff in. Spendy.<p>So, this leaves the smalltimer to save $15 on their monthly power bill by using new rack servers that don't need or have an NVidia GeForce 9000+ and 10-drive RAID. Stripped down BIOS and maybe no more IDE support, that kind of thing. Hot Rod rack servers of the skeleton/pure-compute variety, not the AlienWare one.",1302225871

Their views on women (or any group), popular or otherwise, are irrelevant so long as they don't needlessly bring them up, but when they choose to do something that makes some members of the audience less comfortable and less likely to attend in the future (particularly since speakers are often perceived to represent the community), then that's a loss for the entire community, with negligible gain.<p>Even if those who are offended are overreacting, publicizing their views is probably the best way to be sure that both speakers and attendees can make well informed decisions about which conferences to attend.<p>If they want it to be a club for guys (and women who'll deal with it), that's their prerogative. If, on the other hand, they think it's more to their benefit to be inclusive, they should probably make an effort not to be needlessly offensive.

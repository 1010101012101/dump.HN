I've done the online thing, striking up conversations at bars, walking my friend's dog through Dolores park, etc. Even did Date & Dash once. I ended up meeting a cute Chinese girl, and we dated for about 2 months. However, it was <i>really</i> obvious that she was looking for a green card (""I want a baby!"" in bed one night, and a very uncomfortable dinner with her uncle another night.) I definitely want to get married sooner rather than later and have a family, but 2 months is a <i>little</i> quick.<p>Its basically worse than hit or miss. I've had more ""success"" giving a cute girl a cigarette at the bus stop. At least that has led to an ongoing friendship, and in another instance having a good accountant. The last woman that I met of any reasonable quality was when I was having a couple of drinks with my gay roommate at a bar in the Castro. She was out with some of her friends, we got to talking, exchanged numbers etc. Went out on a few dates, then she flaked on me with no explanation.<p>Yeah, SF is a f*cked up place to try and meet anyone.",1268095960

The error always point to the same file and it's never the file with the problem, or even the same type of file. Not helpful.<p>While I agree that the problems could have been worked out with more knowledge of the framework, it doesn't help to gloss over the issues.

1176948,comment,1176619,1176909,0,0,anthonyb,,,"I think it was more that the automated web testing part of Pylons wasn't particularly well integrated with SQLAlchemy. So (eg.) it's basically impossible (AFAICT) to populate the database with preexisting data and then directly call the controllers, since when you commit the data in your controller, you can't access the database afterwards when you get back to your controller. Instead, you get lots of odd tracebacks - things like ""Instance <Foo at 0x103779f90> is not bound to a Session"". It also means that you can't do rollback type testing - you have to stick different data in, or blow it all away and recreate it manually.<p>Django on the other hand, has fixtures, which you can create from your existing database, and use rollbacks, so they're really fast. Combine that with the test client, and I can just write my test cases and forget about setting stuff up. People often go on about Django's admin interface, but I find that the rest of the framework is written to the same sort of standard, so there are lots of hidden gems (like fixtures) just waiting for you to find them.",1268093351

But after all Null is defined by human anyway.<p>""...And you, as a consumer of that method, need to check every time if the return value is Null. If you don’t – you (usually) get a Null pointer exception and your program crashes.""<p>Can't this be handled by the language itself, by default?",1244793597
654322,comment,654273,654313,0,0,davidw,,,"Yes and no.  I think that, given all the money and hard work poured into it, Mono is, relative to other languages and things out there, not as popular as it ""ought"" to be.  Here we have a first-rate JIT compiled language that's completely free (no Java ambiguity), with a team of smart hackers behind it, and yet not that many people use it. I don't, nor do I know anyone who does, besides one of the core developers who lives here in Padova.",1244793585

654320,comment,652877,652877,0,0,billswift,,,"Peer review only helps when the peers have a clue.  By the articles own admissions, no one has any real idea of how to do macroeconomics that predicts the real world.  Without the discipline of reality, peer review becomes group-think.  In macro they develop all sorts of claims and mathematics that have no connection to what actually happens. But with so many different approaches and claims some actually seem to predict what happens, just as some stock pickers seem to predict stock prices, though it is mostly random.",1244793472

Now, if your up against someone that has lots of power, its well understood the legal process can be bought to a certain extent.  That said, there are quite a few cases in China where the ""little guy"" prevails in the courts.<p>The real issue is simply that this new system is not safe for many reasons, without regard to the situation suggested by the parent post.",1244793326

What Mono does is allow those Windows shops with their .Net experienced developers to start experimenting with and hopefully integrating Linux.  Without having to change the language and framework they've standardized on.<p>In that way it gives Linux an inroad it didn't have before Mono.",1244792890

654309,comment,654149,654223,0,0,magv,,,"To be fair, the base language of PLT never claimed to support any relevant standard. Instead implementations of standards are built as libraries on top of the base language. So PLT does provide both R5RS and R6RS, both with mutable pairs.<p>It is when you want to use PLT-specific non-RnRS libraries from RnRS code, you run into pair incompatibilities.",1244792605

I switched to Kubuntu and am happy with it. Now Moonlight is infecting Linux.""<p>There are two parts to the Linux community.  One part sees Linux as a legitimate tool they can use to bring down costs while maintaining stability.

654286,comment,654168,654221,0,0,psygnisfive,,,"While it's true that the potency of LSD is ridiculous (normal doses being a thousandth of what other drugs usually require), the effects are not limited to LSD. Mescaline and other psychedelics produce similar improvements in cognition, and have higher dosage requirements. Mescaline, for instance, requires around 100mg for a light dose, while for LSD it's over 1000 times smaller at about 20-70ug. So if you're concerned that LSD is just too easy to fuck up, in terms of dosage, try Mescaline instead.",1244790885

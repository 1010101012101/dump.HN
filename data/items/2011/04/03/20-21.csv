2403989,comment,2403696,2403696,6,0,tokenadult,,,"<i>The problem has several components: comments that are (a) mean and/or (b) dumb that (c) get massively upvoted.</i><p>a) If a comment is truly mean, a personal attack on another community member, delete the comment and subtract from the user all the karma that the comment gained. That is something that can only be done by someone with curator powers here, but the rest of us can be encouraged to flag such comments more, and reminded not to upvote them.<p>b) If the comment is dumb, make a better comment in the same thread and downvote the dumb comment, especially if the dumb comment already has significant karma accrued. Anyone who has downvoting power (and user who has made many upvoted comments) can do all of that, and anyone who can post a comment can do some of that. Again, the curators can remind users from time to time to maintain those standards.<p>c) All users can browse the bestcomments list<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a><p>to search for massively upvoted comments that are still within the downvoting time limit, and downvote those that are mean or dumb. Curators can delete those comments as needed.<p>Example and reminders go a long way. (By the way, because I, and I suppose most users, don't read this site exhaustively, I'm not fully aware which recent comments may be the most problematic. But definitely feel free at any time to provide me or other users with advice on how to raise the quality of comments here.)<p>After edit: another comment from another user in this thread prompts me to ask whether all new users who sign up see the site guidelines automatically or not.

2403982,comment,2403696,2403776,8,0,Alex3917,,,"I think you're right about mediocre comments being the real problem, and about identifying good users and rewarding them programmatically. I would take this a step further though and apply the same logic to story submissions.<p>For example, bloggers who write insightful stuff on a regular basis should get some sort of bonus when content from their domains is upvoted early on. Maybe each upvote would internally count as 1.5 upvotes for the first 100. Similarly, bloggers who have a reputation for writing linkbait should get some sort of penalty.<p>Right now you can easily spend ten hours writing an amazing blog post and have it not even make the front page. This provides an amazingly strong disincentive for intelligent people to contribute, especially when the front page is dominated by vapid current events gossip. The heart of the problem is that the current system is set up to reward people for submitting garbage from TechCrunch and to punish people who try to make thoughtful contributions of their own.<p>Similarly, content that takes longer to read should stick around on the new page for longer. Otherwise the front page gets dominated by fluff. Again, there are lots of people who would be willing to spend 10+ hours writing a 3,500 word essay designed to benefit the HN community, but they don't because they know that there is essentially zero chance of it hitting the front page. Right now by the time the first few people finish reading, it's no longer on the new page so any upvotes basically count for nothing. This problem gets vastly worse as the amount of content submitted increases, so if nothing changes then we're probably only a couple more iterations away from having the front page be dominated by pictures of cats.<p>On the other hand, I've been ridiculously productive the last few months now that HN is basically unreadable, so maybe the decline in quality isn't such a bad thing after all.",1301864269

There are a lot of variables and few folks have done the really heavy lifting of trying to propose an experiment that eliminates as many as possible.<p>My current setup is two 24"" monitors one above the other in 'landscape' mode. It is more productive (for me) than two monitors that are adjacent. For a while at Google I used one monitor in front of me and one to the right in portrait mode. I find reading code in portrait mode helps.<p>When I'm playing with one of my old VAXes and have a VT420 with its 25 line by 80 column screen it is almost comically painful.<p>However I'm about to embark on a 'new' thing, which is three monitors, a 30"" one in the center and then two 24"" monitors in portrait mode on either side.

I currently have the 10"" MiMo monitor [1] with some not so clever yet custom code to interpret screen touches as non-motion mouse clicks (which is to say I try not to reset the mouse co-ordinates to the Mimo monitor but I do want the 'click' event delivered to the window that is open. If you're digging around for a startup plan with a hardware component you are welcome to make me one of these, happy to give a requirements document to anyone who wants one.<p>As for the mechanism that makes one more productive, its apparently removing the physical action.

The weird thing is that Spaces became MORE useful when I disabled the feature that wraps around from the first and last spaces. (It's not a stock tweak - you'll need to download Tinker Tool to access the option). The very slight discipline this imposed helped me develop a really clear idea about which space I was in. I can now ""see"" them floating on either side of my actual screen.<p>So now I think that ""single"" vs. ""dual"" is overly simplistic. In truth, optimized productivity can also result from the use of virtual screens, without which, a dual arrangement may be more efficient, but with which, the single screen suddenly gets a lot more useful.For the sake of focus, I love knowing where stuff is, and being able to 'push' it out of view until the precise moment I need it. When I do toggle to it, it's one of only one or two things visible. As a result, I always feel like I'm entirely focused on whatever is immediately in front of me. Also, the vague Minority Report sense of big horizontal scrolling never gets old.<p>Of course, how well this works varies depending on the task. Obviously, different people have very different jobs. Also, how well people can imagine and handle virtual spaces is by no means constant. In any case, if you're generally a fan of dual screens, but are not 100% satisfied, and have a good spatial imagination, try one big screen + Spaces, and see if this combination makes a difference.",1301863280

Don't display karma and average scores of users, again, past a certain point: this prevents (subconscious) game incentives which lead to e.g., posting comments that say something stupid or mean but which tend to agree with general tendencies of the site.<p>For example, I can post a comment decrying Blub with a snide remark (e.g., ""You wrote a 1,000 line Blub program? Was it 500 getters and 500 setters?"" in a thread discussing software projects) that is both information free and mean (perhaps Blub wasn't the author's preferred choice, but chosen for him or required in order to build an application for the iBlubber). People on this site generally dislike Blub, so the comment will get upvotes without adding any value to the discussion (an example of adding value would be saying you were able to do this in 100 lines of Flub using its cool new hygienic macros with a link to a paper on hygienic macros in Flub).<p>That's not to say all comment score data should be gone.

Perhaps there should be additional barriers in place, such as this:<p>0 - Ability to comment on threads<p>50 - Ability to upvote comments<p>500 - Ability to downvote comments<p>1000 - Ability to submit articles/stories<p>2000 - Ability to downvote articles/stories<p>etc. While this may reduce the number of incoming stories, perhaps there could be a way for power users to sponsor stories submitted by those who aren't able to submit them to the feed themselves.

That is, everything touches in some way on what's going on in the world and how you feel about it. Maybe I'm applying too broad a brush, but I can see politics and current events in every post on HN -- and always have. About the only exceptions would be the driest of technical articles. If you want a board of Erlang innards, go for it. Other than that, it's always going to be Steve Jobs, EFF, which VC trashes which other, etc -- all gossip. (And gossip is just a broad term for current events and politics)<p>People post, comment, and vote based on <i>emotional response</i>. You can pretend to cut that out by banning, say, any mention of political parties or politicians, perhaps any pending legislation, and past legislation, how economics prevents or helps startup creation, etc -- but I think you'll just trade one monster for another.<p>2) I've been thinking about this for a while, and the key problem here is that the commenting system promotes learning how to fit into a community of hackers, not actually doing anything useful. We think of the system as being some sort of logical function to take all kinds of input and provide the ""best"" stuff for hackers, but it's exactly the opposite: it teaches hackers how to get votes from other hackers. In other words, spend 3 or 4 years on here, like JacquesM did, and if you're lucky you become an expert on what to say and do to make large groups of hackers agree with you. The karma system and large crowds isn't training the material to be more targeted to hackers -- it's training hackers on how to target other hacker's response with their material: how to fit in, what to post to get a rise, how to succeed without really trying, etc.<p>You can blame the topics for being too emotional, but I think it misses the point. We've always had all kinds of issues on here. What we're getting is a larger pool of people actively gaming the system in hundreds of ways: what kinds of snide comments might sneak by, what's the best time to run flame-war submissions, who to praise, what topics to champion or deride. That's a function of forum size, not system parameters. And that's not even getting into the fact that with a large enough audience, somebody is going to get pumped about just about anything that appears on the front page.<p>There's nothing nefarious about this. It's all just people being humans. After all, if you are in a conversation, do you speak in order to provide factual information? Or do you speak based on your current emotional state and to effect the emotional state of others? Why would we expect HN to be any different?<p>Nyah.

Then any upvotes such a comment accrued, count as negative karma for the upvoter.  There might be other, simpler and more visible ways to achieve the same net result.<p>I know good hackers are interested in many things besides hacking, but ""intellectual curiosity"" is being interpreted very broadly.

Good links and discussions stayed around for days, every aspect of startup life was discussed.<p>Sadly that time has long gone. As I write this, on the front page of HN there are maybe 4-5 stories out of the top 30 that relate to startup topics.<p>Articles relevant to startups are being pushed out by generalist tech and programming articles that are better served by the many many subreddits on these topic. While it's open to debate whether these are on-topic on Hacker News or not, HN is far less about startups than it used to be.<p>Many contributors to HN don't even see it as being about startups anymore, even contributors who've been involved in HN for over a year are talking about it as a tech or programming site. The startup stories that reach the frontpage tend to be on technical topics, the non-startup tech audience of HN now means stories focused on the non-technical aspects of startups such as marketing and raising money make it to the front page far more rarely than they once did.<p>I remember complaining at one point about the number of stories about A/B testing on the front page. I wish I could complain about that now.<p>Take a look at Gabriel's Ask YC archive - it was created to address the startup questions that frequently turned up on HN, for many of these topics I can't recall when I last saw them discussed on HN.<p>There are a hundred social networking sites that serve the tech community from proggit to dzone, what differentiated HN was the focus on the startup community. That focus is dying out, and we're becoming just another tech social news site.<p>I don't think we can make HN be more about startups again, the audience has changed too much for that, and it wouldn't be fair to the non-startup tech community that's come to rely upon HN.<p>So instead I'd like propose that HN stays as it is, but pg creates a new HN called Startup News, which has startups at it's heart as HN once did.",1301862059

How about if I displayed the point totals for subtrees, but not for individual leaves?  Would it solve the problem if you could follow other users, and see their comments graphically distinguished in some way?<p>Another problem is that people use point scores as a guide to voting.  It's clear from voting patterns that many if not most users vote not to express approval or disapproval, but to cause the comment to have what they believe is an appropriate number of points.  If I didn't display points, people couldn't do that.  Perhaps that's not a problem.

I think there is a serious disconnect between the state of the art in computer vision and what's used in industry.<p>The demo was cool, but the techniques are not <i>that</i> revolutionary. From a cursory glance through the papers, it is basically AdaBoost (for detection) and Lucas-Kanade (for tracking), with a few extensions.<p>Not to discount the guy's work at all, it's very cool and does a good job of pulling together existing algorithms. But not groundbreaking in the sense of, say, Viola-Jones was for object detection.",1301861031

If that were the case, any big company could legally recreate what twitter or facebook does. Rather, I think the real value of startups is in the user affinity and traffic it experiences regularly. Google won't make twitter, because everyone already goes to twitter (this brings up an interesting point about making people feel like they have ""things"" on your site, which can help create a more secure user base, but that is a different point). Ad sales reflects traffic, sustainability reflects traffic, public influence reflects traffic. It all seems to break down to that, and that's what companies are betting on (or ""mining"") when they buy a start up. So, if a founder decides that he is interested in making a quick buck from the start, they won't work to establish a strong user affinity, or secure traffic levels, or significant public influence, and hence will be selling a low quality product. For an over rated opportunity-price, no less, because their pricing is based on the opportunity image created by older, successful, dedicated startups. This low quality atmosphere is what this writer warns against, for the benefit of buyers, sellers, and users. The markets have always secured demand for companies that create strong, stable foundations, and it was only a matter of time before the internet's companies started following the age old rules of capitalism too. So be warned, VCs and new founders alike. If you're not making a quality product, its only a matter of time before big companies figure out how to weed out the miners and it won't be as easy to make a quick buck with a low quality company.",1301860801

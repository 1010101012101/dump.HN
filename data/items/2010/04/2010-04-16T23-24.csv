That's the entire reason that companies like ACA, who Goldman claimed picked the mortgages, exist: to act as an impartial third party that can analyze and rate the risk of the underlying assets when there are too many for the investor to do it herself.<p>If I sold you <i>one</i> diamond, and you were a shrewd buyer, you'd probably take it somewhere, perhaps to two people, to get it examined and ensure its authenticity. But if I offered to sell you a big ol' bag full of thousands of assorted gemstones, and claimed that everything in the bag was either pure diamond, ruby, emerald or opal, 25% each, you probably wouldn't have the time or money to go through each one and analyze its authenticity. Even if you did, my offer may have expired by the time you do. So instead, I say that the gems were all hand-picked and inspected by the American Gem Trade Association, and that they all checked out to be 100% authentic. If you trust me and the AGTA, you might buy the bag at this point. However, when you get home & find out that they're all rhinestones, I guarantee that you will consider my false assertion that they were picked by the AGTA to be both material and criminal.",1271462240

1272222,comment,1271662,1272121,0,0,bad_user,,,"> <i>Scala is more statically typed then Java.</i><p>Being a contrarian here :)<p>It doesn't matter how static Scala or any other language is, all that matters is how well its type system fits into the target VM, and Java VMs are optimized for Java.<p>When the type-system doesn't fit you have to resort to workarounds, like allocating more objects than you should, or using introspection, or generating bytecode at runtime.<p>The JVM does fine here, but Dalvik is a VM created for a restricted environment.<p>That said, I don't think static languages should have problems ... as long as they don't stray too far from Java ... like being lazy or having type-classes.<p>> <i>Modern ... statically typed languages don't have to the have the verbosity of Java and C++</i><p>They don't have subtype-polymorphism either (basically OOP).<p>Since you mentioned OCaml and F#, you should take notice that the OOP subset doesn't support type inference when you're dealing with interfaces, that's because it is not possible. OOP was designed for dynamic type-systems, and it mixes with static typing like oil and water.<p>Also Scala's type inference is really restrictive and should't be in the same league as any other language with a Hindley-Milner type inference system.<p>The type inference is really useful when you're dealing with parametric polymorphism. Scala doesn't really have that either ... generics only save you from explicit type-casts, nothing else, and are a far cry from Haskell's type-classes or C++'s templates (which are late-bound). The recently introduced Manifests or the implicit conversions save you in many cases, but those are just ugly hacks that only solve certain use-cases.<p>I really don't get why Scala is so popular. It's as if people are so tired of Java that they are looking for a way out, willing to compromise just for some syntactic sugar.<p>It's interesting to note that none of the issues of subtype-polymorphism (tight coupling) or those of parametric polymorphism (hard to get right) are of importance to <i>dynamic languages</i>. In a dynamic language polymorphism is simply implicit.<p>That's why I hope people will invest in VMs that support dynamic languages in the future ... static typing is a bitch to get right, and it would be easier if the VM wouldn't impose a strict type-system on you.",1271459437

The bit about H1-B I think means funded by H1-B fees, not that it has anything to do with the H1B program.

Shit, I think Starfighter just got its A round! ;-) But of course Starfighter is the absolute last thing that would ever emerge from a program like this.<p>What&#x27;s missing from this press release? Two things in particular stand out to me; 1) Not a peep about getting more software development / hacking / coding / scripting / <i>building</i> more firmly into K-12, and 2) Nothing about encouraging and helping support <i>startup</i> hiring, the actual engine of job creation. How about a program which helps fund community Maker Studios across the nation?<p>Basically this whole things reads like $400 million of pilot studies which will go nowhere and do nothing. We&#x27;d probably be much better off running a highly publicized national / crowdsourced business competition to award 5,000 people $10k - $50k grants over the next 5 years. I&#x27;m not saying it would <i>all</i> be money well spent, but probably better than the distinct flushing noise I&#x27;m hearing with this one. That, or please just mail $1 back to every citizen.",1425977958

Was it [would it be] limited to downloadable versions or were DVD software copies affected too?

The threat of chargebacks makes actual chargebacks usually unnecessary. Just like having an army can be very valuable even if you only go to war rarely.<p>> Yes it is possible. Some hosted wallets let you set up recurring payments. This is awesome because unlike credit cards, you don&#x27;t have to give the merchant authorization to debit your money, but you give this authorization only to the wallet hoster.<p>With a bank account you can do this as a &quot;standing order&quot;. It&#x27;s safer than most of the bill-payment methods. And surprisingly useless, because most of the time you want to pay a bill that can vary, so you need to give the merchant authorization to tell them how much you need to pay them.<p>> setting up a recurring payment disclosed in the fine print when you think you are authorizing a one-time payment.<p>Something you can only stop by making setting up payments less convenient. If bitcoin takes off, it will need a system for seamlessly setting up recurring payments from a website that wants to - and the exact same scams will apply.<p>> This scenario covers literally ALL in-person transactions. Hardly a &quot;very special case&quot;.<p>No, it only covers cases where you pay <i>after</i> using the thing you bought.

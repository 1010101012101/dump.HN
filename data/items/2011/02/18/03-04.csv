2234131,comment,2233930,2233930,0,0,nika,,,"I've been in this position many times. I remember when I first heard of Amazon in 1994. I remember when Google went public. I knew google was a great company, because I was in the search industry, but I didn't invest.  I didn't feel it was in my circle of confidence. I remember when Apple was at $13 and had $6 of cash in the bank, and I still passed.<p>I don't regret any of that. Ok, well, I do, it stings a little. I'm greedy, I can't deny it.<p>But when I have invested, after a few years stumbling I ended up making more than a %100 return a year for many years of the last decade. I saw the housing boom before it happened (when Motley fool was recommending real estate) and profited from the boom and the bust (Which really started in 2006, though wasn't in the popular consciousness until 2008.)<p>And then I got out in 2007, after my best year ever.  Why?  The market was not acting the way I believed was rational (or the rational irrationality typical of the market that creates inefficiencies allowing me to profit).<p>It was a tough decision, getting out in 2007.  But I felt great when just the next year it became clear my timing was perfect. (This is not a super power on my part, it was just good timing. I could have made more by waiting 6 months, but  by comparison, I did fantastic.)<p>These hard decisions may look foolish in retrospect or like genius. I don't fault fool.com for being cautious about google.<p>The point of investing is that you have to do it based on rationality and the calculated return given the amount of risk.<p>A high price and a low confidence factor in the underlying business can mean a bad investment.  Consequently a 100 year old company that is ""boring"" and thus unpopular can produce a massive return, because the price and the risk is low.<p>Jumping in to ride up over valued companies (like google was at least for many of those years) is what led to the original dotcom.   I lost money on a couple of my positions there because I fell into that trap... and learned my lesson.<p>So.  Don't look at this as stupidity.  It is wise to pass.  You do better by not taking flyers on things that don't seem like mathematical sure things (risk factored in) within your circle of confidence.   I'm no investing genius, but I am disciplined... and that's all it takes.<p>On fool.com:\nThe motley fool was a great and useful website for investing in the 1990s.  When the dotcom boom was happening they advised caution (though they made their rep in the early days by recommending companies like iomega).  Then around 2000-2001 they seemed to have a change in management, or at least a change in focus.<p>They switched from being prudent contrarian investment advice, to more mainstream and more ""opinion"" oriented.<p>It is kind of impressive to think that I stopped going there a decade ago.  I literally haven't visit that site for 10 years, and I used to spend a lot of time there, to the point where I had quite a following.",1298000435

This is why companies like Google are forced to go public: They have too many employees and investors who own parts of the company, and the SEC's threshold says: ""After 500 people own a portion of your company you have to go public; being private is too much of a risk to the shareholders.""<p>So whether you get preferred (which is usually issued shortly after the investment or founding) or common, you're unlikely to see that piece of the company be worth anything until the company sells, goes public or issues dividends. In the case of a preferred shareholder, you can also get some liquidity in the event of bankruptcy or shutting the company down.<p>To put it simply, when you are given options, you can exercise them by purchasing them at a very low valuation.

The faster a ship goes, the less useful the <i>real</i> wind will be since the apparent wind shifts forward, making the ""sails"" less efficient.  The Wikipedia article had an anecdote that the Flettner rotors worked to 20-30 degrees from dead ahead.  That is pretty good for a sailing ship of 1924 vintage, but still leaves large angles where the wind is not useful.  It also didn't say how efficient the rotor was at 20 degrees apparent wind. :-O<p>Obviously, a Flettner rotor sailing ship is vulnerable to all the problems of a traditional sailing vessel: wind is unreliable (except in the trades) and often comes from a direction that is not useful (astern, forward).  Note that the trade winds are east/west and a ship generally wants to go east or west to cross the ocean.  Square rigger ships like to sail downwind.  Flettner rotors, not at all.",1297999822

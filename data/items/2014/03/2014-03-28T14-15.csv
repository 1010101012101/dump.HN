This top-down decision making is both what causes funding to stagnate (since it&#x27;s up to bureaucratic and political whims) and causes labor issues to fester (since the number of alternate employers is so low).<p>With that in mind, a call to unionization seems rather futile. There is no body to bargain with, just bureaucrats and budgets. What leverage would a union have against that?<p>Fixing loopholes in labor laws is overdue, but why unionize and create yet another special interest group? Workers in all sorts of industries, including tech, are exempted from labor laws. Why not start a broader movement to fix those loopholes?",1396018793

The set of all possible startup ideas is an infinite one, so no matter what your age/position/domain is, you can, at any point in your life find one or more ideas that can be turned into a startup.  \nHow to find them? => Just be a keen observer for a couple of days. Look at the people around you and assess the stuff that you go through on a daily basis and ask yourself whether you can fix something that&#x27;s broken or do something to make it easier. The next question is, how better will your target customers&#x27; lives be when you solve that problem. If the answer is &quot;a lot&quot;, then eureka! you have it.

I humbly submit the coverage of the latest US invasion of Iraq, where the evidence overwhelmingly indicated a dearth of WMDs, and yet US government talking points were rarely disputed, and sometimes printed without critique.<p>So, my hypothesis is that similar issues will definitely not get said coverage if expediency-by-software is valued more highly than analysis.<p>There&#x27;s no real solution to our difference of opinion, but you haven&#x27;t actually refuted my logic, as you claim.<p>We both agree there are different types of breaking news, and that they need to be treated differently.

I&#x27;ve practiced mindful meditation on and off for a year or so.  I&#x27;ve never hit an hour or even half an hour at a time, but I will say it is fairly effective for recalibrating your mental state even with just a few minutes a day.  I find myself much more patient, accepting, and clear-headed when meditating regularly, which was exactly what I was hoping to accomplish.  I occasionally find myself re-centering and focusing on breathing while not meditating - just a reflex that develops with the practice, and even if its effects are strictly physical (eg more oxygen to the brain), it still feels good, mentally, to get that shot of clarity throughout the day.<p>I can&#x27;t speak to its effects on addiction, or other forms of pain, but I would definitely recommend some form of meditation for everyone.",1396018424

Since the battery of the Model S extends all the way to the front axle, there is a greater risk.<p>All that said, there is still the risk of the object striking some critical component in the engine of an ICE which is typically in the front.

7487548,comment,7485673,7487420,15,0,aestra,,,">Alcohol withdrawal can kill late stage addicts<p>This is correct and very very important. Your brain is physically changed. Alcohol&#x27;s primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person&#x27;s nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure.[55][56] Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.[12][57]. Please do it with professional help, in a hospital setting. An addition recovery/psychiatric hospital, not a &quot;normal&quot; hospital. Search online or in the yellow pages. You may have to travel some to get there. I&#x27;ve seen many addicts withdraw and some have no problem, but some have life threatening seizures and other absolutely terrible physical symptoms. I heard one person say &quot;this is the worst pain I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my life!&quot; Also, not being able to leave prevents you from drinking to stop the symptoms, they are locked facilities, when you sign yourself in you agree to be there for at least 3 days. The hospital will provide you with proper aftercare as well, tailored to your needs. They will also control your symptoms with medication, depending on what the symptoms are. You get checked up on constantly. Getting the psychiatric care from the hospital (and followup) will help you get to the root of the problem - why you drink - and you can treat that, instead of just treating the addition itself.<p>All this care is generally covered by insurance.<p>If you aren&#x27;t very religious, please skip AA and all the twelve step programs. They are really offensive to atheists and non believers. (I have read part of the AA &quot;big book&quot; and had to stop because I couldn&#x27;t take any more. The section on &quot;what if I don&#x27;t believe in God&quot; was especially offensive) Seek CBT or other non-twelve step treatments. Again, the hospital will help with finding a program for you and referring you there, often taking care of the paperwork for you.<p>You have acknowledged you have a problem and wish to get help. This is the most important step. Please note: this will not be an easy journey, this will be difficult. You will have to work for it. You probably will have to change many things about yourself, including your thinking.<p>Good luck and I truly wish you the best. I am always happy when addicts get better, I grew up with an addict parent, and I know what it can do to yourself and others around you.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcoholism</a>",1396017875

There was a period of my life when I was also hopeless.  I thought that I had lost everything. In a sense, it was true. (Rather, I destroyed most of what I had and subsequently lost the remaining pieces.)<p>Despite all of that, it <i>does</i> get better. It took me far too long to accept that.<p>The fact that you are posting here tells me that on some level you are ready to get better. Recognition of the problem begets hope.<p>Maintaining an attitude of &quot;it doesn&#x27;t get better&quot; turns out to be a recursive function. Since lives are finite, the base case turns out to be total self-destruction.<p>At each time step, each recursive call, sustained hopelessness only begets <i>more hopelessness</i>.<p>Not only do the effects of addiction and hopelessness compound, but you get a first row seat. You watch the function expand, you see every call. You literally destroy yourself in a slow, humiliating, dangerous, and deliberate fashion.<p>A friend of mine liked to quote a man named Albert J. LaChance, he wrote: &quot;Addiction is a slow form of suicide- suicide on the installment plan.&quot;<p>Whichever metaphor you choose, one thing is clear: changing your attitude is a necessary (but not sufficient) prerequisite for recovery.<p>You are obviously intelligent, so it should go without saying, there is no avoiding the fact a chemical addiction is a uniquely difficult problem to solve. Fortunately, it is a problem that a great deal of science is expended upon. And there are many ways to receive medical treatment.<p>Tedious self-help meetings and hollow platitudes are <i>NO</i> substitute for scientifically validated medical treatment. In your case, it is essential that you have medical intervention while you detox.<p>(Self-help is very helpful to some, and it <i>does</i> have a reported effectiveness of (last I heard) 10 - 50% (surely, a study carried out with utmost statistical rigor!)<p>Self-help meetings aren&#x27;t right for me, but I will vouch for their occasional effectiveness.<p>Should you choose to follow the self-help branch of your recovery timeline, be aware that the self-help phase comes <i>after</i> the detox branch. All future recovery branches of your recovery timeline form after the <i>medical detox</i> node.)<p>You need medicine and science <i>right now</i>!<p>Alcohol withdrawal can kill late stage addicts. You wrote six months ago that you attempted a cold turkey solo-detox and experienced DTs. Those suck. They are also a sign that you need to be extra cautious in your recovery.<p>When you go to detox, go to a licensed recovery center where a doctor can monitor you. Usually this means a hospital equipped with mental health facilities. An ER will suffice if you are out of other options or are having seizures. You can also go to a rehabilitation center (with a competent medical staff)! The last option might start your detox and then segue into a 28 day (or longer) program.<p>Alcohol is perhaps the most dangerous drug to detox from. (Perhaps surprising to some, you won&#x27;t die from heroin withdrawals.)<p>You can (and should) get medical leave from your employer for treatment. I&#x27;m fairly certain it&#x27;s illegal for them to deny that. (Since you are a competent developer, I&#x27;m assuming you work at a company with benefits.)<p>If you do not have health insurance, please contact your local medicaid office.<p>Please do this. For your the mother of your child, for your kids. For the person in the future who you will come across who needs help with their addiction. But most of all, for you.<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>This last part is my favorite aspect of hacker news. I get to tell someone that they are wrong.<p>I used to have your attitude. I even attempted suicide. By the grace of faulty nylon, I&#x27;m still here.<p>&quot;It doesn&#x27;t get better.&quot; <- That quote is factually incorrect. I&#x27;m just one instance of its disproof.<p>Now, to break Hacker News guidelines with extreme prejudice:<p>IT DOES GET BETTER. PLEASE, PLEASE SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT. IT DOES WORK. YOU ARE WRONG.

One economist was a woman who was very highly credentialed -- multiple Ivy Leagues, quant-heavy background, extremely knowledgeable in her particular field. He tendered her an offer, expecting her to take over a fairly critical position within a week.<p>He immediately got a memo from the governor&#x27;s office tersely informing him that he would need to submit to them <i>her husband&#x27;s notarized approval in writing</i> before they would allow him to hire a woman.<p>To contextualize, this was a few years after a flurry of state ratifications of the Equal Rights Amendment. A kind of proto-&quot;Mens&#x27; Rights Movement&quot; had, by the mid-1970s, coalesced against the ERA and legal protections for women in the workplace.<p>In this state, a fairly prominent state politician had publicly taken the lead in trying to roll back protections for women (in part by arguing that the ERA would require public swimming pools to be topless!), and the liberal(ish) governor was fighting a conservative cultural backlash from constituents. As a result, political agencies were deluged with a series of <i>ad hoc</i> restrictions that basically made it impossible to hire or promote women unless they were in &quot;traditional&quot; roles such as the typing pool. (To his credit, my father fought through the strictures, using the same kind of cussedness that led him to take long road trips with African-American fellow military officers through the Deep South of the 1960s, in which they found out that, black or white, a military uniform didn&#x27;t protect you from redneck sheriffs.)<p>If you think about the sweep of history, four or five decades ago is a <i>very</i> short time, and even though gains for women and minorities have been very real and tangible, it&#x27;s all too easy to see how fragile they are. Today, racism and sexism are generally more tacit than explicit (and often supported by decent people who simply aren&#x27;t aware of, but <i>can</i> be educated about, the superstructural biases of their organizations), but the results are just as pernicious for those operating on life&#x27;s higher difficulty settings.",1396016515

Often the issue is that when you have different groups with different conceptions of what this scale entails, that is when you have hilariously &quot;bad&quot; interactions, and can result in ridiculous drives to the extremes of the &quot;platonic&quot; scale.<p>Another common pitfall (I think anyways) is that some of these drives to extremes are driven at least partly out of a sense of the current &#x27;threshold&#x27; being placed far too far away from where they &#x27;should&#x27; be. Large disparities create large pressures. Coupled with wanting to see things change soon (obviously), and that people have an intuitive motion that if you try to push against something to reach X, you&#x27;ll probably end up with X-1 or something, you can at least kind of understand some of the drive to extremes.",1396016340

7487321,comment,7480094,7483974,1,0,tgb,,,"No, I believe that you are still mis-interpretting the push broom scanners. A greyscale push broom scanner would have a single row of pixels that are lined up perpendicularly to the direction of travel and whose rays are in the plane perpendicular to the direction of travel. So yes, these rays would span many kilometers, but only in one direction. In order to image a 2D area of the planet the entire satellite would need to traverse down it linearly - which is something that satellites happen to be quite good at given how fast they are moving. This is almost like how a document scanner works - it translates a line of sensors across a document to construct a full 2D image.<p>For a full color image, three linear sensors are used, each displaced some distance along the direction of motion. So the fact that the rays are spreading out in the perpendicular doesn&#x27;t change the distance the satellite must travel to image the next part.<p>For example, your second paragraph doesn&#x27;t hold. The large separation of rays only occurs in the direction perpendicular to that of travelling. Note how your method would be imaging the same place multiple times on each pass whereas a push broom scanner would capture each one just one.<p>For your third paragraph, I agree that this could be done but that&#x27;s simply not how the sensors are aligned and that difference is important. In particular, it&#x27;s the very difference that I&#x27;m trying to point out.",1396015877

There would need to be some further incentive for schools to try it.<p>For the school the costs are probably greater in producing the letter - if any printing is required then the personnel costs are going to be approximately equal up to the point of direct distribution. Instead of sending 32 letters to each class (all classes are <32 in my kids school) then they will need to count the letters in to bundles and label for the class they are to be received by. The teacher/assistant will then need to consult a list to ensure the right students receive the letter, a potentially changing list, rather than simply give all students a letter to take.<p>Initially up take is likely to be low IMO. There will also be a lot of issues with parents not reading all letters or having technical problems. The letter-in-bag is very hard not to deliver for primary-age children and the school can look in the bag to see if it&#x27;s gone - getting notice of email letters having been seen is possible but less robust IMO.<p>Currently my kid&#x27;s school don&#x27;t de-duplicate for siblings. They could do that and, I estimate, save may be ~10% of material costs immediately. I think the administration of that is similar to how you&#x27;d have to administer who isn&#x27;t receiving letters by email.<p>Schools face another option - allow advertising on letters (which I generally disprove of FWIW). That way income is likely to dwarf the theoretical savings via reduced toner use.",1396015265

If you want to put it on the web, you&#x27;re going to have to create logins, passwords, make sure that it is up to security standards, and deal with parents who can&#x27;t reset their password.<p>When I was going to primary school (over a decade ago!) the &quot;IT facilities&quot; were beyond outdated, poorly maintained, and just not up to par in any respect. We were still using floppy disks, which were an old technology even then. Are we going to update every school with the latest equipment? At taxpayers cost. Train the staff and teachers to use a new system? Maintain the infrastructure?<p>Not everyone lives their life online.

She gave her reasons as she is now older, thus much wiser. She has way way more money now then my siblings and I ever had growing up, so money issues wouldn&#x27;t be a problem like it was when we were growing up.

To print one page tended to need three sheets as the print head was some inches below the tractor wheels. To print that one page would require a form feed to get to the start of a page, another to get to the end of the printed page and a third form feed to make sure some paper was in the rollers.

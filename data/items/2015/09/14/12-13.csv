In the first place, demand will focus more and more on the services sector (which already accounts for over 70% of GDP in many developed countries), with new forms of\nproduction playing a more important part. The measurement of “intangible” activities will take on increased importance and this should bring about greater integration of economic statistics with social statistics: concepts such as those of human and social capital are already generating interest and becoming the subject of quantification, albeit still in embryonic form.</i>",1442235552

But I don&#x27;t have the time, nor the priority to go into full detail. The main points are: different community, different goals, almost zero code sharing, different technical solutions, different literature, ... The differences are technical and social. Each of the points would need more explanation, for which I don&#x27;t have the time.<p>For me &#x27;Lisp&#x27; is something practical. I have a bunch of non-trivial code -> can I compile/load it? Can I port it easily? Are there people who would be interested to share? What are they using? Can I work with them?<p>Example:<p>Macsyma is an old Lisp program. New Lisp dialects appeared. Macsyma was ported to them: Maclisp, Franz Lisp, NIL (New Implementation of Lisp), Lisp Machine Lisp, VaxLisp, Common Lisp...<p>This software can&#x27;t be ported to Clojure or Racket, without fully re-architecting the software, and I&#x27;m only thinking about the basic Macsyma, without GUI or other system dependent parts.<p>> that the &#x27;vague&#x27; definition serves a much more practical purpose<p>which one? to confuse people?

PACER isn&#x27;t just (or even primarily), a public-facing interface to these documents. It&#x27;s the system lawyers and courts themselves use to access these documents. There&#x27;s a substantial DoS risk there that warranted investigation.<p>> But, if you&#x27;re in the first world and the 21st century, reading about a court case at home in your online newspaper, why shouldn&#x27;t you be able to instantly and freely consult the actual public court documents online?<p>Absolutely nothing stops whoever wrote the article from hosting the relevant documents at his or her own expense.<p>> Even if they don&#x27;t give completely free access, the huge surplus is proof that it costs less than 8 cents per page/$3 per document! (It&#x27;s so astoundingly huge, I&#x27;m willing to hear why it&#x27;s incorrect, but I&#x27;m doubting the NY Times got it wrong.)<p>PACER subsidizes the rest of the judiciary&#x27;s IT. The idea is that the people who use court services (litigants) should be the ones to pay for its upkeep, through user fees. So PACER fees aren&#x27;t the government making &quot;huge revenues off of public documents.&quot; The primary purpose of PACER, again, is as a tool for litigants, so it makes sense for it to be a revenue source for the judiciary.<p>The idea of the government distributing hashes and letting people host documents P2P style is cool, but what&#x27;s the point? What are people going to do with that information? It&#x27;s just information for information&#x27;s sake. The idea scratches a techno-futurist itch, but I think there is very little tangible benefit to making these documents more easily available to people who don&#x27;t care enough about them to pay a couple of bucks for them on PACER.",1442234726

10214768,comment,10212959,10213612,0,0,mike_hearn,,,"If you read the paper, ManagedC is doing something very different to Managed C++, despite the similarities in name. C++/CLI is a different language where you have to define garbage collected pointers manually. ManagedC is basically the same as C99, albeit a whole lot more strict about things that might work on other compilers whilst being technically undefined.<p>To be more specific, in ManagedC the C code is interpreted, profiled and then JIT compiled just like in Java, where the JIT compiler (Graal) can then do very aggressive profile guided optimisations like inlining huge amounts of code, and using the resulting compile graphs to eliminate the overheads introduced by the sanity checking. It can also do things like eliminate dispatch costs when using function pointers and the like, in the same way it&#x27;s done for Java.<p>What&#x27;s also super interesting about this approach is the language interop you get. ManagedC is based on a project called TruffleC, which doesn&#x27;t have any of the security/safety checks. TruffleC was built to enable Ruby code that&#x27;s also being compiled by the same compiler to call into Ruby C extensions intended for the MRI interpreter. What&#x27;s really crazy about this work is, the compiler can merge the C and Ruby code together incredibly tightly, to the extent that running a mix of Ruby and C on this experimental JVM can be much faster than running the Ruby and C together on the original implementation. The JVM can actually optimise out all the interop costs of moving between the Ruby and C worlds, just using compiler optimisations.",1442234468

I have yet to see BLE work consistently. Which brings me to my next point. This &quot;could&quot; be due to the fact that products I&#x27;ve seen implementing BLE are not pushing past the data transfer limits.<p>In the write up, they are claiming you can push past the standard 23 byte limit through &quot;...a procedure called “Read/Write Long Characteristic Values” that allows you to go over the limit with a series of messages. In practice this means that you’d be able to have a transfer ratio of around 125 kbps (133 connections per second * 6 packets * 20 bytes in each packet – see “Getting started with BLE”).&quot;<p>Would be very interested in seeing what sort of consistency an app could get out of this bump in bytes.",1442234461

Further energy is not the only dependency modern civilization has on oil.<p>You can&#x27;t glibly dismiss Goodstein&#x27;s analysis. He addresses this belief (canard) that we have hundreds of years of coal in the ground, or that the resource limitations which restrict the future of oil do not also apply to coal. To replace the energy, fuel, industrial and agricultural uses of oil, coal consumption would have to increase by at least 5x, with catastrophic environmental consequences. Goodstein also points out the unreliability of estimated reserves, which in many cases are political rather than scientific.",1442232049

I believe we&#x27;re in for a push-back against overly-intrusive computer monitoring, which should slow down AI development. I also believe that &quot;intelligent&quot;, &quot;kind&quot;, &quot;moral&quot;, and &quot;useful&quot; may also be much more mutually orthogonal than currently believed. Finally, mankind really needs to work through the period where mid-level AI could either exterminate us or love us into extinction. That&#x27;s going to take some time to work out.<p>But it&#x27;s all just guesses, of course.",1442232042

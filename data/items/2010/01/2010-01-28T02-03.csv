And I'm sort of ok with that; I'm not ok with them actively trying to stop you from removing those limitations on your own device, and calling you a criminal if you do.

Jobs has stated many times in the past that he prefers to ""control the end-to-end user experience"" which is code for ""prefers to control the margins on Apple products, from hardware to software"".<p>Everything in the iPhone ecosystem allows Apple to control the end to end margins retrievable from the consumer. The Mac ecosystem lost this message a long time ago and this seems to me like a soft-shoe effort to turn the Apple consumer onto a new computing platform that's on the Steve Jobs ""margin controlled"" message.<p>It also cleanly gets the moved away from the Wintel style computing and back into proprietary and incompatible land. Within two years, people will be using these things for general computing, with mice and keyboards and webcams and all kinds of specialized docks and iPad 2nd monitors and such. Within 5 years they'll offer a complete out of the box computer running in this constrained ecosystem and traditional Macs will be relegated to some type of ""Pro"" offering targeting writers and artists.<p>Already it's principle release feature is the presence of 140k apps, ready to roll with it that you can purchase only from the Apple controlled online store. And there's discussion on porting more traditional productivity apps (iWorks) to the platform.<p>Effectively, this puts the iPod/Phone/Pad derivative products into direct competition with Apple's own products, which already have plenty of competition from traditional Wintel boxes, Netbooks of all varieties, other tablets, the upcoming Chrome OS machines, and Android computing platforms. But because it's so tightly controlled the intersection in the primary computing ecosystem is minimal.",1264646974

1082813,comment,1081519,1082087,0,0,MrFoof,,,">The iPad is barely more portable than a laptop, and much less functional.<p>How many users actually use all the functionality?<p>My sister bought a 15"" MacBook Pro for Xmas.  She checks work e-mail via Outlook Web Access, occasionally works with MS Office documents for the office, uses an IM client, YouTube, browses the web for vacation ideas/planning, iTunes, iPhoto and... that's it.  Not a luddite.  Quite savvy and bright.  Only 30.  Yet that's all she does with a $1700 laptop.<p>Granted, you could do the same with a netbook, however, the iPad has nothing to really ""mess up"".  There's not much to configure.  There's not much updating.  It's instant on.  It has better battery life.  For her intents and purposes, it does 95% of what she wants.  I can say this for my parents, and either most of my friends, or their spouses.<p>For these types of users the <i>lack</i> of a full-blown OS is actually an advantage.  There's nothing ""to mess up"".  There's very few things to configure.  No boot times.  Longer battery life.  Easier to carry around.  Cheaper than a conventional laptop or desktop.  Can be always online (WiFi or 3G).  Presumably a very simple ""restore"" or factory default reset process.  I would also assume you could get a MobileMe account and have all your data backed up in a data center somewhere for easy restore.<p>I, personally, am not sold on the device.  I already have an iPhone, and I have different computing needs as a developer.  However I won't ignore the fact that it'll cut the mustard for a large number of users as an ""occasional"" computer, if not a primary computing device.",1264646468

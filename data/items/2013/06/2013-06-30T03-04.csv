5964653,comment,5963891,5964454,2,0,vertex-four,,,"They are toiling for this money. Specifically, the mining system exists in order to verify transactions, put them together into a block, and distribute that block to be added to every client&#x27;s copy of the blockchain. The reward for performing this very important task is a certain number of Bitcoins &quot;generated&quot; at present, along with transaction fees that the miner can collect from any transaction which includes them.<p>The reason for centralising the Bitcoin network on the miners (and for each block, one particular miner) this way is simple - consensus. It&#x27;s of paramount importance that every client on the network has exactly the same copy of the blockchain, otherwise double-spending can occur - causing one half of the network to believe that some Bitcoins were transferred to one address, and the other half to believe they were transferred to another.<p>The easiest way to do this is to build the network in such a way that one node holds an authoritative copy of the blockchain, and distributes that out to everyone else. But that goes against the concept of a decentralised network. So instead, what Bitcoin has done is built a system where every mining node races to solve a computationally hard problem, that they can prove they found the answer to, in order to become authoritative in order to add a single block to the blockchain. The incentive to do so is the &quot;mined&quot; Bitcoins, along with the transaction fees for every transaction included in that block.<p>Without this system, Bitcoin could not exist.<p>For the record - even though the miner is authoritative in adding a block to the blockchain, it cannot forge transactions. It can however refuse to add a transaction to the block, which sometimes happens if the offered transaction fee is too low. The transaction might be added to future blocks if other miners are OK with the transaction fee.",1372564758

There are other other photo editing programs (gimp has actually gotten pretty good at this point), however there is a significant cost to re-learn how to use the new program. This cost to learn effectivly creates a lock-in effect, where the cost of Photoshop is cheaper than the cost of learning something different.<p>Additionally, Photoshop does not have ongoing costs with pirates. Whereas a web service needs to maintain the servers for the free users. And because Photoshop is pirated, the do not have an expectation of customer support.",1372564629

It seems very likely that the companies listed are unaware of the surveillance, and the dates listed are when the NSA was able to tap and decode their data streams. I would really like to see evidence that companies are knowingly participating, otherwise this may be defamation by the Post.<p>Tech: All the companies listed have multiple sites/datacenters. While they use SSL/TLS to encrypt client-server connections, they may not be using encryption to protect server-server connections. Most of the database replication systems don&#x27;t use encryption by default. Companies use circuit switched connections between sites, they don&#x27;t own the fiber between two datacenters. That fiber is owned by the big telco providers, and passes through equipment owned by the telco providers.<p>We know big telco providers like AT&T and Verizon are very willing to give the NSA access to <i>everything</i> without putting up a fight. It seems very possible to me that the NSA is surveilling these companies without their knowledge.<p>For example it was reported that Dropbox was &quot;coming soon&quot; to PRISM. I don&#x27;t believe for a second that Dropbox is knowingly giving access to the NSA. &quot;Coming soon&quot; may mean that the NSA has tapped Dropbox&#x27;s communication, and they are working on decoding it, and converting it into a usable format for PRISM.",1372562173

Suddenly this grandiose talk we&#x27;ve heard regarding Ecuador&#x27;s &quot;principals&quot; is gone, and now it&#x27;s about what the US can do for Ecuador. It&#x27;s almost as if Ecuador doesn&#x27;t really give a shit about human rights.",1372561397

Are you serious?</i><p>Deadly serious:<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;Looking only at the core measure of economic performance  GDP growth  Thatcher&#x27;s performance was slightly better than that of her predecessor, James Callaghan, but slightly worse than under Tony Blair, with average growth over her tenure standing at around 2.3% a year.<p>(...)<p>Perhaps the best look at what Thatcherism meant for British families comes from a series of measures calculated by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which calculated household incomes after tax (and any income from benefits), and put them into monetary amounts relative to 2010-11 prices, stripping out the effects of inflation. These figures show families got richer. The median household  the household right in the middle, where half are richer, half are poorer  earned the equivalent of 270.74 a week in 1979. By 1990, this had increased by 26% to 341.58. But, as you would expect, these gains were nowhere near evenly distributed, and the poorest got the least. A family in the bottom 10% had a weekly income of 151.58 as Thatcher came into power. Eleven years later as she left Downing Street, the family had just 158.57  a mere 4.6% more. The richest families  the top 10%  did far better, with their incomes increasing from the equivalent of 472.98 in 1979 to 694.83 in 1990.<p>(...)<p>Still, the poverty figures don&#x27;t look good: the number of children in poverty almost doubled under Thatcher, from 1.7 million in 1979 to 3.3 million in 1990. Pensioner poverty in the same period increased too, from 3.1 million to 4.1 million. Those numbers rise still further if housing costs are factored in.<p>(...)<p>By the World Bank&#x27;s measures, industry (including manufacturing) fell from contributing 40% of the UK&#x27;s GDP in 1979 to just 34% in 1990  and has since fallen more dramatically still to just under 22%. The consequences of deindustrialisation hit huge swaths of the UK, particularly Wales and northern England, hard. Unemployment soared from 5.3% in 1979  a level high enough for the Conservatives&#x27; &quot;Labour isn&#x27;t Working&quot; poster to go down in the annals of great election adverts  to peak at 11.9% in 1984. In 1990, the year of Thatcher&#x27;s departure, it stood slightly higher than when her era began, at 6.9%.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p>><i>The successful welfare state you are talking about is already considered a failed model, because of the numerous people taking advantage of the system. I am quite sure you don&#x27;t live in Europe...</i><p>I very much live in Europe. And it&#x27;s only considered a &quot;failed model&quot; by neo-liberals and private interests that want to demolish it. The people are very much for it.<p>In fact, the countries in Europe that are the most successful financially and socially, from Germany to the Skandinavian countries, are the ones with the best welfare states.",1372561341

6171774,comment,6169999,6169999,4,0,larsonf,,,"I read this and kept thinking whether the hotel lobby is really the reason why Airbnb runs into trouble. Or, for that matter, even whether the Taxi Lobby is what is really hitting Uber.<p>Yes, hotel owners and taxi drivers are not exactly pleased about the disruption. And, yes, they have lobbyists to further their causes. But don&#x27;t think for one second that these people wanted the regulation to begin with. Absolutely not. The regulators wanted to protect the public and put in zoning, licensing, etc. The initial regulation had very little, if anything, to do with turn-of-the-century lobbyists.<p>For the most part it seems these new companies are facing not some nuanced part of the law, but like basic, prehistoric regulation that is practically universal in the Western world, designed to protect people from surpassingly likely horrible practices--like getting kidnapped by an unlicensed driver. Something not that unimaginable -- at least according to London public service posters everywhere. Some laws have very murky reasoning, I&#x27;ll give you that. But zoning and licensing in these cases do not. So to say that Cities are stifling innovation by enforcing some of the most basic laws of the modern state, then it&#x27;s a bit glib.<p>Incumbents are mad because they are following the rules and some of these new firms are clearly not. But the incumbents aren&#x27;t the biggest problem, which the article more or less hints as the culprit. No, the problem for &#x27;innovation&#x27; is convincing people why they should let the other half of their duplex run a youth hostel without a license. And no, saying your K-nearest neighbor algorithm&#x27;s got it covered is not going to be enough.<p>Some might compare this to copyright. And this is where they&#x27;d be right. It&#x27;s not very obvious who copyright protects. No one has ever had a GB of songs cause them to wonder whether their neighborhood is safe anymore. You might even make the same case for fin services. Why regulate those? Well, I&#x27;d grant you there too. How many people died from the fin crisis again? Perhaps we are pushing it. Either way, in the land of the physical universe, the universe where Uber and Airbnb are so clearly inhabiting, the reasoning behind the laws is remarkably obvious.",1375869265

6171761,comment,6170117,6171715,8,0,harrytuttle,,,"Rather than slate me, some constructive discussion would be nice. I&#x27;ll go from my side:<p>1. Static type compiler verification saves tonnes of problems. Try managing a 2MLOC dynamically typed solution and you&#x27;ll get what I mean.<p>2. Static typed languages are way easier to refactor as more metadata is available to the tooling.<p>3. Static typed code is easier to test. The type contract is available over the boundary between the implementation and the test cases.<p>4. Defined interfaces without leaky abstractions are easier to produce when you have static types.<p>5. Static types allow the compiler to infer more information about how to compiler your code resulting in faster, more efficient code and lower memory usage plus you don&#x27;t have to compile an instance of a function with every possible type consideration at runtime.<p>6. Statically typed data serialises more reliably i.e. goes over the wire easier without behemoth contracts and parsers at each end.<p>7. Statically typed languages tend to have better numeric accuracy as differences between decimal, floats and integers are always deterministic and there are defined casts and conversions between each during operations.<p>I could go on...",1375868840

6171689,comment,6168144,6168644,5,0,vidarh,,,"Last I heard (it&#x27;s been about a year since I looked into numbers), Power/PPC chips appeared to be outselling x86 chips by a substantial margin with the caveat that it&#x27;s hard to come by numbers from the &quot;smaller&quot; x86 vendors (like Via) that might very well be selling larger numbers than expected of the low end alternatives but at much lower prices and margins and so fly under the radar.<p>x86 is likely something like the 4th or 5th largest chip architecture by volume shipped today. Last estimate I&#x27;ve seen was in the 360 million range per year, maybe as high as 400 million.<p>That&#x27;s after ARM, likely to ship 3 billion this year, MIPS and PPC probably in the 500+ million range each unless there&#x27;s been massive unexpected changes over the last year.<p>X86 gets all the attention because it&#x27;s on desktops and in laptops and because Intel is disproportionally important because their <i>revenue</i> is several times that of any other CPU manufacturer because nobody else ships nearly as many high end chips (e.g this puts Intel at 7 times Qualcomm, at second place, in revenue from CPU/MPU&#x27;s last year: <a href=""http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20130521205843_Intel_Dominates_Microprocessor_Sales_as_AMD_s_Shipments_Drop_Below_Qualcomm_and_Samsung.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xbitlabs.com/news/cpu/display/20130521205843_Inte...</a> )<p>And for the surprise contender, it is unclear where the 6502 architecture falls: It ships in &quot;hundreds of millions&quot; a year according to Western Design Centre). Note that this might very well largely be in the form of licenses for embedding the cores in custom ASICs or in FPGAs, so whether you&#x27;d want to count that is another matter (as an example, some Amiga&#x27;s had keyboards with an embedded 6502 core + PROM and a tiny amount of RAM). It&#x27;s possible that some of the other extremely low end 8-bit CPU cores that are still being used as micro-controllers might also ship volumes like that.<p>I&#x27;ve seen no indication that Sparc is anywhere in the running",1375867197

I would expect the same would also be true of C#.  You really want something that you can use to get a site out quickly and revise just as quickly.<p>If you go at it from a desktop C# point of view, you are probably going to make a number of fatal mistakes.  I did some job hunting recently in CA and I came away with the feeling that the companies developing in that environment are really not doing anything interesting.   think there is a mindset in that world that will hold you back.<p>My best advice is to pick Django or Pylons or Rails and do a 2 week code sprint to implement a  prototype of your idea.

This approach likely pentuples bandwidth, and that's optimistic.<p>2. If you've never posted to Craigslist, don't try to redesign it. Anyone who's posted with an image knows that no such ""product zoom"" would be possible because of how CL transforms uploaded images to a suitably small file size.<p>Craigslist is a paragon of usable design, and you don't want someone who's critical of it for aesthetic reasons to be touching your website.<p>I got started in this industry as a web designer and I'm considering a move back. There are so many clowns who don't know a thing about usability and think that too much whitespace plus an anorexic serif equals quality.",1252278211

Was there a specific business objective? If so, was it a success? Or was it a more general statement on the company's values?<p>As hackers with an entrepreneurial mindset, we might face the question of whether or not to open-source some of our work. The question is: when we make that decision, which hat are we wearing?",1252278138

I've only seen people mistake it for personals and use it for advertising crap.<p>I agree that the New York Times designer's version is a big improvement.  A few things that really bug me about the current version that are fixed with this design include the left aligned headers / fixed page flow, more obvious search box, and fixed colors.  In my opinion if you're going to use default browser link colors you should be using the default browser background color.  Maybe that just bothers me though, who knows, I'm weird.  Also, why do we need to see a list of countries / states / anything besides local cities?  How is that not just more useless clutter?",1252278137

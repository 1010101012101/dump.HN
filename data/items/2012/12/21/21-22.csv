4954731,comment,4954449,4954449,2,0,mtgx,,,"I for one hope they also let manufacturers create many more ""Nexus"" devices, if they are going to pursue this with Motorola anyway. They need to create a Nexus program with <i>much stricter</i> guidelines than the typical Android phone (no skins, no extra crapware, lag-free, and which gets at least two dot-oh upgrades - like 5.0 and 6.0), and also allow them to make $100 (unlocked) Nexus devices, too.<p>I wouldn't buy the cheap one for myself, but I could recommend them to people who just want a cheap smartphone. I'd much rather recommend them a clean Nexus device, than a skinned custom-software one, with an unpredictable user experience, that also doesn't get upgrades.<p>All of these Nexus devices also need to have all of their upgrades handled by Google alone - just like the Chromebooks. In fact, this Nexus program should be handled almost like the Chromebook program. Nobody gets to touch the Chrome OS but Google.<p>I think these devices would become increasingly more popular thanks to the word of mouth of the people who actually know what they are and recommending them to all their friends. This would clean up the Android ecosystem a bit by having exactly one user experience across Android devices, and having a major portion of the Android ecosystem be upgraded on time and for a longer period.<p>As for this X-devices strategy from Motorola, they could use it as ""iPhone-killers"" - as hero devices of their ecosystem, like Nexus has been until now. But they need to be devices of highest quality, and they shouldn't try to also compromise on price, like they did with Nexus 4. I'm not saying that Nexus 4 suffered from it, but to be honest that strategy started to worry me a little because Google might want to get to lower and lower price points in the future, and forget about making the very best devices in the market. And I think that would be a very bad idea. Google needs to excite ""influencers"" in the tech world, and they can't do that with sub-par cheaper devices.<p>But with the X strategy, they can deliver these hero ""best in the market"" devices, while the Nexus program would allow for a sub-group of the Android market, to have devices from $100-$600, from different manufacturers, but under very strict guidelines, and with Google handling all the upgrades. Basically the Nexus program should become what Android should've been if Google could restart Android today.<p>tl;dr - Nexus = Windows/ChromeOS strategy, with one UX and all upgrades from Google for at least 2 years. X-phone - iPhone strategy; Google's hero device for the year, the one that's made to excite the tech-insiders, and push the ecosystem further, and the one that always comes with the dot-oh versions, not dot-one (e.g. 5.0, not 5.1).",1356127165

That's simply not sustainable when it comes to the new market that is forming for tablets. $300 is more than the whole BOM for your typical $500 tablet. I doubt you'll see that chip in anything cheaper than $800, at a time when you get ""good enough"" tablets for $200 whole. Intel's competitor to ARM simply isn't the Core line-up. It's Atom, for better or for worse.<p>In terms of OS for an x86 tablet, you're looking at Windows 8, or Linux with a custom shell, and that's it.  There's an unofficial x86 port of Android, but I wouldn't stake any real product on that without any support from Google.<p>Since MS has already established the baseline price for the Win8 tablet around $800, and they're marketing it more as a tablet PC that can do everything you do with a normal desktop or laptop than an iPad, is this really that much of an issue?",1356127107

The tech press just could not understand why Apple was so hesitant to join in the screen size war and go from 3.5"" to 4.0"" to 4.3"" to 4.7"" phones. The tech press is, of course, almost entirely male. Meanwhile, more than half of the potential customer base for these phones is female, and disproportionately young females at that. Females have substantially smaller hands than males. My wife, who has no exposure to the tech press debate over screen size, lamented to me that her new iPhone 5 was great except she didn't like how the screen was bigger and harder for her to use one handed.<p>Apple gets it. Apple understands that teenager girls are a bigger market than male geeks and designs its products accordingly.

It's the dirty little secret of ""free"" cloud services: you're using somebody else's resources to store your own (intellectual) property, relying on vague TOS clauses that can change from one minute to the next. This is exactly why this brouhaha took off: all of a sudden people ""felt"" those clauses were now abusive; they realised they were relying purely on Instagram's benevolence, and they ""felt"" that benevolence was now gone.<p>This is the case for <i>any</i> cloud service, including Dropbox, iCloud etc; there are probably a few exceptions (I'd expect Salesforce to have tighter TOS), but the overwhelming majority of consumer-oriented cloud services are in the same boat. Last I checked, Dropbox reserved the right to go through your files -- for troubleshooting purposes only, no doubt, but again we have to take their word for it. How many times did you actually read those TOS? For what I know, they might now state that Dropbox can sell your data to China.<p>The hard truth is that the garage is not yours and it will never be yours; in the best scenario, you are renting it with a tight contract , but in most cases you just had a chat with the owner once and he sorta promised not to resell your boxes full of comic books.

Nobody sold this guy his guns, Congress <i>never had the opportunity</i> to come between him and his weapon of choice.<p>If we're going to talk about further legislating guns to prevent this specific type of crime, we've only got one single option available: you go out to every gun owner in America and tell them to give up their guns, so that there is no chance at all that some crazy person can steal it and go on a rampage.<p>And that is the reason this argument is so old, and why it feels so tired.  Because you can blame guns and gun owners all you like, but that will never solve the problem.",1356126456

4954667,comment,4954449,4954585,19,0,DavidAdams,,,"People always bring up this ""marketing"" canard. Apple has been doing the same kind of (pretty good) marketing for almost its entire existence, even during its darkest days when its marketshare was small and shrinking. Marketing didn't compel people to buy Macs in the mid 90s, and it's not compelling people to buy iPhones now.<p>It's actually quite simple, and any student of the tech industry should be able to follow along. When the iPhone was initially released, it was unambiguously, head and shoulders above any other smartphone. Just way better. And in contrast to Apple tradition, they priced the iPhone at a level that made it impossible for new entrants to compete on price in a meaningful way, due to the nature of carrier subsidies.<p>So people flocked to it, even people who wouldn't buy a Mac in a million years. The software and hardware of the iPhone had great integration and typical, good Apple build quality. So in other words, a great head start on a very hot industry segment. Then they started a robust developer ecosystem, and a lot of small developers made an unexpectedly large amount of money selling cheap apps that iPhone users snapped up because they were cheap, and the economy of scale made it work, and made Apple an unexpectedly huge amount of money from its app store take.  Suddenly, just like Microsoft before them, Apple was in control of a bonanza platform.<p>Quality product + good price + industry head start + robust and lucrative developer platform = dominant market position.<p>And like Microsoft before them, Apple has let the power go to its head. And of course Apple has a long history of control-freakiness and closed platform tendencies anyway. But just as decades of Windows being just unimaginably shitty didn't knock Microsoft off its PC perch, even as alternatives to the iPhone flourish, Apple keeps a strong lead because of natural inertial and platform lock-in forces. In my opinion, Apple's doing a good job of shooting themselves in the foot at every opportunity, but just like hapless Microsoft, it will take years for them to successfully piss away their lead.",1356126333

My point is that at some point Moore's ""Law"" has to breakdown since nothing real can double forever but perhaps you don't find philosophical/metaphysical arguments compelling.<p>As way of analogy, look at electric power generation based on a heat engine cycle.  Ultimately you run into theoretical limits based on the Second Law of thermodynamics. On top of these physical constraints are Economic Law such as marginal utility which determine if it is really economically efficient to spend x dollars to gain y increase in efficiency or to stop short of the theoretical limit due to diminishing returns on investment in efficiency gains. These are real laws that computer chips will eventually run into.<p>My understanding of computer chips is that they are running into thermal limits and also bumping into quantum tunneling effects that are interfering with the deterministic nature of logic gates.  I am sure people are working on ways around these limits and they may very well may find new and brilliant ways to continue the increase in processing power. It may even be true that theoretical limits to computation are far far away from where we are now and Moore's ""Law"" will continue to apply for decades but it still would not make it a actual physical law in the proper sense of the term.",1356125697

May not apply to people for whom a gallon of kerosine is a significant fraction of their monthly income.<p>I have a hard time seeing myself using something like this, except as task lighting. I'd be fine to have to lift a weight if I was only going to be using the kitchen for 30 minutes (it could even serve as a useful timer), or similar. But getting up every 30 minutes rules out using it anywhere I need longer duration light for eg, reading.<p>Also, anywhere I could use this, I could use any of the many inexpensive crank LED lamps available everywhere, which run for similar amounts of time.<p>The pity is that, with the right design, this could support a longer cord for a further lift distance, so it'd run an hour. Or multiple weights used in sequence or parallel so it can be primed for even longer (iirc that's how my grandparent's cuckoo clock worked). From what I can see, it's not designed to be very hackable, and something like this needs hackability.<p>The LED light is the other problem with it; I'd much rather have a well ventilated kerosine light than blue tinged LED for almost any task. (I'm curious to see studies about kerosine health risks however.) Since this light cannot be moved, it has to illuminate the whole area, and its light doesn't seem up to it, so I'd be doubtful about eg, reading by it either.",1356123694

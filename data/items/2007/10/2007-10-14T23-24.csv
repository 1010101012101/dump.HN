The father is supposedly in Germany. I'm supposed to take payment for an entire month, and then wire the money to a nanny who's taking care of the kid.<p>Neat variation on the classic overpayment scheme. <p><a href=""http://www.scambusters.org/overpayment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scambusters.org/overpayment.html</a><p>But I want to catch this thief. I haven't lost any money, but since I was counting on the funds until I received more of an indication of this fraud (it's taken a while), I'm kind of in a hard place.<p>Has anyone ever had any luck counter scamming, or catching the scam artist?

67796,comment,67766,67766,0,0,mhartl,,,"I've used LaTeX for basically everything: reports, letters, papers, course handouts, Ph.D. thesis, book.  Typesetting is superior to word processing in so many ways, but unfortunately LaTeX seems to be going out of fashion.  Except for physics and math journals, even technical publishers seem to prefer Word (!) to LaTeX nowadays.",1192406014

67792,comment,67596,67596,0,0,bents,,,"Couchurfing is great. I have been using it for few years already. Its completely different way to travel. Most people take you straight into their lives - take you out with their friends, show local pubs, shops, parks or concerts that other way wouldn't get int tourist route. Its more of a view into local culture and life not just visiting landmarks and talking with other travelers in hostel. Hostel are also fun. Hostels are like going to meet with other travelers. Couchsurfing is like visiting a distant friend. And you can also have both of them. Just because you stay in hostel doesn't mean that couchsurfers don't welcome you. You can still meet for a drink or party or walk around city. Its more of a network for meeting local friendly people than just crashing their couch.",1192405142

67790,comment,67766,67766,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My book was written using Docbook SGML with a LaTeX based processing chain and custom style sheets.  The publisher ended up importing from the HTML version (the least pleasant of all of the output formats) into Word documents with their custom tags, so it kind of lost some of the magic.<p>Eventually I ported it to Docbook XML and moving to RenderX XEP for processing, in order to get better (by some definition of better--mainly just better maintained stylesheets, and the tools seemed to handle the length of my book better) PDF output.<p>Now it's in a wiki at <a href=""http://doxfer.com/Webmin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doxfer.com/Webmin</a> and I probably won't be back to LaTeX for that particular project.<p>I do keep coming back to it, though, out of curiosity, every time I read Knuth.",1192405005

I'm sure he would get a kick out of it.<p>It's not obvious what the hell Zombo.com <i>is</i>. Visual design is clean and uncluttered on the splash page, the voice over is a little freaky makes me think of some African dictator, perhaps Idi Amin.   I cant say anything about the rest of the site because I cant get past the splash page.   Kudos for the candy colored ""hypno"" throbber, I'm sure it will be a hit with the Mary Jane and Dancing Bears crowds.

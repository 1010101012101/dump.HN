But it could also be true that writing good PHP requires far more skill and time. Skill I might not have.

4050315,comment,4049764,4049965,14,0,jjcm,,,"Disagree. It will be the biggest investment in research Microsoft has placed in the mainstream market to date. Windows 8 is effectively a research project. Microsoft wants to know and understand how people will be using different modalities in their everyday work. Windows 8 will have huge issues, no doubt, but Microsoft will learn enormous amounts from it. Metro is a smart move - window chrome is unnecessary, and takes up more space than it should. Moving to a tighter and more relevant UI will prove beneficial in the long run. It will also test out some of the more tablet friendly interfaces, and most importantly Microsoft will learn how and why those fail in the desktop settings (and how to fix that). These are unknowns right now; Microsoft is going all in so they can discover them.<p>That said, Metro dashboard aside, it's a nice OS. If you stay in the desktop mode it's really just a faster and more stable version of windows 7. I've been using it as my primary OS for the last few months. The lack of a start menu will confuse people at first, but the keyboard driven execution of programs should be a welcomed change for many power users. There will certainly be a backlash from users, much like there was from Vista. Down the road though, I can see Windows 9 learning a ton from 8. That's where I see the true value of Windows 8.<p>Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft.",1338497759

That is, while we analyze a Turing machine, the actual machine is rather arbitrary.<p>Paraphrasing from Sipser[1], the class of decidable and undecideable languages is the same for <i>any</i> ""reasonable"" model of computation where ""reasonable"" involves some basic things like not being able to do an infinite amount of work in a single step. So while any particular model (e.g. a Turing machine) is arbitrary, the class of languages is actually natural.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www-math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-math.mit.edu/~sipser/book.html</a><p>This makes sense--any model of computation containing a countable number of instances will not be able to decide or even recognize every language.

First, it's a strong deterrent against interference, from either the Soviets, proxy forces, terrorists, or some independent 3rd party (pirates?).<p>Second, it's handy to have 1st world medical care available immediately just in case. If a bad landing caused severe trauma, burns, or what-have-you, or if an emergency appendectomy was needed then care would be right at hand.<p>Third, speed of recovery was important, which meant big ol' helicopters, which means aircraft carriers.<p>Fourth, a worst case scenario survivable landing could involve the capsule landing significantly out of the drop zone, causing injury to the crew (partial chute failure, very hard landing), and sinking forcing the crew to evacuate the capsule. Potentially all without radio contact. In that scenario you'd want to be able to mount a robust search and rescue operation, which is just the sort of thing that a carrier battle group excels at.<p>With more experience, less geopolitical pressure, and more capable spacecraft we can ratchet that response way down, but it wasn't entirely unjustified at the time.<p>Edit: Case in point, the 2nd ever manned flight in the US (sub-orbital even) Liberty Bell 7 had the capsule sink and the astronaut, Gus Grissom, swimming without much assistance in the open ocean. If recovery had taken much longer (even by minutes) it's likely he would have drowned. That set the tone for the later recovery operations.",1338497216

4050224,comment,4040379,4040379,1,0,burrisj,,,"One thing you're wrong about- RE brokerage is under heavy fire right now and is being attacked by many, many startups.<p>The strongest moat thats defended residential RE brokerage from disruption is the interdependent nature of the business. Because both the buyer and seller are represented by agents in most transactions, brokers must collaborate to close deals at the same time as they compete for listings. Buyers agents have an incentive only to show their clients homes whose sellers offer them a standard 3% commission. To attract more listings and still retain interest, sometimes sellers agents offer to cut their own fees while still offering the full price to the buying agent. The reason that this approach hasnt become widespread and significantly whittled down commission standards is that the vast majority of sellers agents are also buyers agents, meaning that both parties have a vested interest in preserving the commissions on either side of the table.<p>Because of this solidarity among buyers and sellers agents, the only way for the brokerage business to be hacked and rendered truly competitive is for one half of the equation to vanish. Either FSBO listings will have to become so widespread that sellers agents largely disappear from the picture or property search, negotiations, and closings have to be made so simple that buyers agents fade to irrelevance. But when one side crumbles, both sides do.<p>IMO, it's far easier to hack the buying-side process than the selling process. RealDirect and DotLoop are interesting in that they try to essentially automate the process of selling a property yourself (RealDirect by providing appraisal services, submitting listings to MLSes, and curating marketing channels etc. and DotLoop by standardizing legal docs/paperwork), but these companies face an uphill battle in convincing sellers that they are every bit as talented at receiving top dollar for their home.<p>IMO, the best way to hack the industry is to streamline combine a Trulia/Zillow/StreetEasy proprietary MLS with DotLoop's standardized legal/paperwork management system. The one missing piece is data-driven appraisals accurate enough to convince buyers of their worthiness. Nobody's quite got this down yet, but Kwelia seems to be closest. The trouble is that not enough sales data is available to accurately correlate prices to location/amenities/property info. Although most US cities maintain public data mines that contain title documents, many buyers mask their purchase prices with evasive chicanery that reads along the lines of ""sold for $10 and other goods of significant consideration"".<p>All that being said, your model of offering perks is an interesting way of convincing attracting clients to an existing brokerage. Partner with some furniture suppliers/local businesses to offer some exclusive discounts and I think you're onto something.",1338496714

In Python, you have much more advanced metaprogramming facilities, depending on what kind of effort you wish to go to. You have the normal introspection, magic methods and metaclasses as you mentioned (which, IMHO, are in themselves already much more powerful than what you can do with the C preprocessor). But you also have access to exec and eval which lets you do all kinds of crazy stuff that isn't possible with C macros. Using operator overloading and classes, you can even create a lot of new syntax which isn't possible in C[1].<p>Finally, if you are really determined, you can even hack semantics of existing Python constructs by instrumenting the bytecode. For example, I saw a hack which adds tail-call optimization to Python functions this way (iirc as a decorator).<p>[1] One example is python-pipeline: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/python-pipeline/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/python-pipeline/</a>",1338496524

Right or wrong, for many people, liking and not liking translates to ""good"" and ""bad"". For example, ""Comic Sans is bad because it's ugly"".<p>The craft - the technical parts (i.e., kerning, spacing, scaling) are much more objective and have more to do with quality, so it's easier to classify stuff as good or bad. For example, ""Comic Sans is bad because its kerning is broken"".<p>I usually ignore aesthetic commentary - everyone's different.

Everybody--even the theory people--gets a thorough background going all the way from high-level programming through assembly and even a bunch of EE (it's technically an ""EECS"" program). Then everybody who isn't specializing in EE or <i>very</i> interested in CS theory does a lot of programming in more advanced courses. On top of this, most people work on some research which also tends to involve a significant amount of programming.<p>Really, it's not like saying an Art History major could easily learn to paint as much as saying an ""Art Practice"" major could.<p>Also, I've found that more CS-oriented people often have a good grasp of software engineering--designing programs, keeping them maintainable, ensuring correctness and so on. On the other hand, non-CS people tend to lack knowledge of theory unless they go out of their way to learn it (and most, unfortunately, don't seem to). It's much easier to get by programming at some company without knowing any theory than it is to learn CS without knowing how to program.<p>Now, there are obviously CS people who spend very little time programming. But, in my experience, they're relatively rare and tend to stick to academia. Really, they're more like math major who happen to like CS than anything else.

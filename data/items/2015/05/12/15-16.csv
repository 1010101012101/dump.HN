This was used, even though the CIA warned the administration that the intelligence wasn&#x27;t actionable, as some of the key evidence used to justify the war in Iraq that the Administration wanted to engage in anyway.<p>But from what I can tell and have read, torture is quite effective when there is a means of verifying specifics (location of hideouts, numbers of people, names of those in certain roles, dates of events), which our intelligence apparatus does have in some capacity. No intelligence information is without bias/counterintelligence/deception and in fact all HUMINT (even honest and helpful ones) - intelligence agencies know this most of all and have mechanisms to counter them.<p>I agree we should be skeptical of torture for a number of reasons.

It is very popular in a population heavily weighted by CS graduates, but popularity doesn&#x27;t imply correctness.<p>As a thesis statement it is wildly out of sync with all but a few of the bullet items, most of which have almost no relation to &quot;CS fundamentals&quot;. Working on projects outside of class/work is broadly applicable to any field, as is contributing to large projects as part of a team or group; neither of these requires &quot;CS fundamentals.&quot; OO programming and learning specific languages are likewise disconnected. Some of the points aren&#x27;t bad with respect to being required in order to be a good software engineer, but even those are too scant on detail (even for a bullet list).<p>Most of the &quot;learn about&quot; points are vague. In particular, as an example, the point about DS/algorithms is awful. What does &quot;learn about&quot; mean? Satellite engineers &quot;learn about&quot; materials, orbital mechanics, radiation and E&M, but they aren&#x27;t in general expected to know the fundamentals (as a physicist would understand the term) of the theories of particle physics or gravitation for example.<p>The bullet points read like a survey of random computing related topics. There is no focus or cohesion connecting them to being a good software engineer. It reads like somebody&#x27;s random meanderings when contemplating something they might find interesting within the field of computing. It&#x27;s not a guide; it&#x27;s a disconnected hodgepodge.<p>Remove everything that isn&#x27;t related to being a good engineer (that would be almost all the points about sub-discipline-specific items, like machine learning), elaborate on the DS/Algorithms points, and provide something in the guide to actually support the opening statement (good luck).<p>That specific enough for you?",1431445642

While it&#x27;s always nice to say &quot;and yes, also learn history and literature&quot;, truth is, eventually you have to not learn something in order to learn these things.<p>This may be a case where where the extreme rigor of the interview process and tolerance of false negatives may hurt large companies and create an opportunity for small startups and individuals.  Here&#x27;s why - a candidate who is very very talented at CS but also learned history and literature might come in at 90%ile, but let&#x27;s say it&#x27;s nearly impossible to come in higher than that without neglecting those other topics.  However, the interviewers are all demanding a 95%ile+ performance.  As a result, they pass on the more well rounded candidate.<p>It&#x27;s even more insidious than this - because they select for the 95%ile, and it is very very rare to be able to achieve this feat without a single minded focus on CS, the people doing the interviewing will be <i>at best faintly aware, and possibly completely unaware, of what they are missing</i>.<p>Before getting too irritated, though, remember that any blind spot on the part of a large company is an opportunity for a small, nimble one.  This is largely what is going on, I think, when you read those stories about talented programmers getting rejected by google and Facebook and coming back 5 years later to sell them a company for 100 times what their salary would have been.  Of course, it&#x27;s a much higher risk path that requires being broke for a while, and may just not be an option for people with other substantial life obligations.<p>There&#x27;s this story I really liked about Andre 3000 (sorry, no link, just something I read, may be apocryphal).  During an interview, he was asked how he chose the three chords for the song, and his answer was that he was learning guitar and those were the three chords he knew so far.  So he took just the slightest bit of knowledge and turned into something great.<p>I read this at a time when I went to a music store and saw an incredible guitarist doing such impressive things with his instrument that he drew a small crowd.  He wasn&#x27;t just showing off, he was the local instructor.  I believe he was also available for small gigs, weddings, parties, that sort of thing.<p>A lot of companies would pass on Andre 3000[1], and hire the awesome guitar playing dude, because Andre 3000 wouldn&#x27;t be able to play a Bflat scale on demand or explain the circle of fifths or sight read a medium complexity piece of music at at least 150bpm.  And I&#x27;m not knocking those skills, if you&#x27;re a musician, by all means, yes, learn those things.  But if that&#x27;s all you focus on, to the exclusion of more creative things (and there&#x27;s enough complexity that you could easily do so), you will starve other important things.<p>[1] prior to the hit.  eventually, accomplishments do speak for themselves.",1431445112

The culture back then was such that if you changed jobs every single year, &quot;there must have been something really wrong with you, since you couldn&#x27;t hold a job down.&quot; Fast forward to the late 2000&#x27;s and IBM had kind of been turned on it&#x27;s head; Dad was real close to retirement and hoping to get out with a pension while he still could but got cut a year before he could retire, when IBM moved a huge swath of it&#x27;s big iron resources to Indian firms, which is a hell of a shame. I&#x27;ve met a lot of these guys, and while it&#x27;s unfortunate that many of them can&#x27;t adapt, I think there&#x27;s a serious lesson to be learned here, as they got pretty screwed by their employer.

Emotions drive all, even &quot;logic&quot; and &quot;reasoning&quot;.<p>But, the issue is not that we act selfishly, for that will always be, as that is how we can be autonomous; selflessness though, facilitates us acting as a group instead. It is pro-social to improve things for others, and so there must naturally be internal mechanisms that drive that behavior, and dopamine is pretty good at getting behavioral responses.<p>But to say &#x27;selflessness&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist is like saying there is no sun.

JRuby, with efforts by him and sepearate work by others, has shown that jokes aside, porting successful languages or language styles to Java (JRuby, Clojure, Scala, and others) has real benefits.  I mean even if you hate Java/JVM stuff, you can use paradigms and tools, partially or completely, on a stack you hate.  For some of us that is a godsend, and I think it shows how cool open source programming is, where people are porting whole runtimes and languages to mix-match for their pleasure.<p>Now, with that in mind, I heard a long time ago, and it might be utter BS that Jython is way behind JRuby in terms of community, and very fairly, not as performant or robust bc there are only so many eyes for shallow bugs.  Is this true?  I see geovizer and others are making use of it, but others using it to good effect and it is worth their while?<p>I am now studying Java academically, and played with Python for years.

The 500MHz CPU can get away with smaller cache or less cache levels. 3.4GHz CPU cannot - there is not enough computation volume available to mask delay of several dozens of clock cycles. There is not enough computation available in 8 SPARC Tx Niagara threads for one 1.8GHz core, even with their scout thread tech (to reduce stalling thread does resolve future addresses and prefetching data when stalled). What to say about 3.4GHz CPU with only two threads per core? It certainly will stall during cache misses for random memory access with (relatively) slow DDR interface.<p>In short, if you reduce clock count for Intel i7 to 500 MHz, you will have: reduced pipeline length from 15-20 cycles to 5-6, proportionally to clock frequency reduction, and reduced stalling penalty for cache misses. Shorter pipeline does not do much harm in case of mispredicted branches. Shorter pipeline also means quicker computation and less stalling in Read-After-Write command chains. To sum, you will have more performance per clock cycle than in higher frequencies.<p>(this is why mobile processors are mostly much slower than desktop counterparts)<p>So, on 7Zip problem hypothetical 500MHz i7 will be faster than just 3.4GHz i7 scaled down by 34/5 factor. I think difference will be two-three fold in favor of 500MHz i7 (mostly due to shorter pipeline, partly due to less severe penalties).<p>This gives that hypothetical 500MHz i7 a speed of 2.5-3MIPS/MHz.<p>PS\nReduction of pipeline from N stages to N-1 stage gives speed boost of about 1/N. E.g., I observed in simulation speed boosts of about 15%-20% when pipeline length went from 5 to 4 stages. This was in &quot;real&quot; clock-accurate simulation, with proper simulation of DDR memory and controller, cache and their delays. The tests were also real, like string and graphics handling/processing.",1431443435

Each page features a different programming language, from A to Z, and has a ‘Hello World’ program in each of those languages. For the kids, there are brightly colored illustrations of the book’s mascot, The Computer Bug, getting into trouble on each page. While, for the older readers each language comes with some trivia and an easter egg pun hidden in each illustration.\nParents and programmers, Michael and Martine Dowden conceived of the book early last year, and have since partnered with Inedo, a small software firm, to help make their idea a reality.<p>Last summer, Inedo enjoyed an unexpected success by working on something a little outside their day to day jobs. They started a Kickstarter hoping to make a small print run of a card game, Release!. This game was themed around, you guessed it, software and coding. To their surprise the project went viral exceeded their funding goal by more than 10x their goal. This opened their eyes to just how prevalent and developer culture was, how fun it was to actually contribute to it. When they were approached by the author illustrator couple they knew they had their next project.<p>As it turns out, toddlers won’t learn to code from this book, but education starts with engagement. When a subject catches one’s interest it becomes a pleasure to learn, rather than a chore. Programming languages ABC++ might be the book that inspires a child to want to be a programmer when they grow up.",1431443026

The Project leader felt extremely bypassed and pissed. In Holland, if you would be pissed you would be considered a dick. Surely if your project members can&#x27;t be trusted to know things about their project and to be positive about you, you should be fired.<p>In my company our group leader is judged by all employees every year and we openly discuss what we don&#x27;t like about his management style. He earns a lot of respect by listening and changing or defending why he doesn&#x27;t change.<p>The best managers find a perfect balance between competitive behavior, ego, humbleness and the ability to delegate and trust employees. Yes, the silicon valley eagerness is rewarded and encouraged but you really won&#x27;t get anywhere if you are a dick. Guess that would make a dutch Steve Jobs impossible.

9532237,comment,9528698,9529299,0,0,mikeash,,,"You&#x27;re largely correct, but there are some pretty substantial differences in the experience.<p>First, Tesla does actually have some cars you can just buy and go. They&#x27;re (currently?) the minority, but they&#x27;re there. They&#x27;re starting to sell used Teslas, and they also have &quot;inventory cars&quot; which are showroom, test drive, and loaner cars which have finished their corporate service and are ready to be sold.<p>Second, test drives are pretty key to the whole process (even if you can&#x27;t test drive the specific car you buy, most people want to test the model) and even that gets caught up in this whole nonsense. Until recently, you couldn&#x27;t even get a test drive in Virginia. I had to go into Maryland to try one out. Tesla had a showroom in Virginia but they couldn&#x27;t even let you drive one, let alone sell you one.<p>Third, in states where they are allowed to sell, you can configure and purchase on site rather than online. The effect is the same, and they&#x27;re basically just punching the order into the computer for you, but for people who prefer buying from a real person it can matter.<p>Fourth, taxes and registration are different depending on how you bought it. When I bought mine in Virginia, I had to take delivery in Maryland, and the sale was actually processed in DC. I had DC temporary tags, and I had to handle Virginia registration and pay Virginia sales tax on my own at the DMV. Now that they can sell directly in Virginia, they can handle registration and sales tax themselves, which saves a decent amount of hassle.<p>Finally, it can affect the post-sales experience in extreme cases. For example, New Mexico is so strict about this stuff that they won&#x27;t even let Tesla open a service center. You can buy one there, but you&#x27;ll have to go extremely out of your way to get it serviced.",1431442942

One of the main reasons is what I alluded to before, the people interested in &quot;interesting&quot; tech stacks are fadish, even if the tech isn&#x27;t.

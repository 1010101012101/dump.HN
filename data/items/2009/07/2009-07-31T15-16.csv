Whoever wrote this review is not experiencing the phone the way I would, or the way any typical user would.  Does he really need to tell us that the calculator has ""a very limited set of functions"" but that ""Luckily, you can find third-party alternatives?""  What kind of readers does this guy have that he's not afraid of losing them to boredom at this point?<p>Another case in point:  I found the section about the web browser buried on page six underneath a larger section devoted to audio quality, which includes frequency response graphs and a table of audio measurements.  And when it comes to the web browser, it says it ""would have used somewhat more user-friendly interface"" and ""could certainly use a bit of fine tuning.""  It describes how to bypass the ""unresponsive"" and ""slow"" zoom feature by tapping a text section to zoom it but notes that it ""is sometimes a hit and miss thing as the web browser fails to fit the text on screen.""  If you ask me, you don't want to use this review to illustrate that Apple is ""behind"" on cell phone technology.",1249055896

During nuclear tests they've found that a tiny amount of matter actually disappears (which may SOUND like it violates the Law of Conservation of Matter), but it's actually believed that that tiny amount of matter was converted into an enormous amount of electromagnetic energy (hence e=mc^2) (i.e. light, for all intents and purposes).<p>If that's true, then this experiment is probably just reversing the process. The light is converted into a tiny amount of matter that's barely detectable (that 'fingerprint' - possibly just a tiny amount of matter that's slightly different from the matter around it), and can be converted back into energy easily.<p>Personally, my theory is that once we get down to more and more subatomic particles, we're going to start seeing that it has more and more properties in common with electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation itself consists of a magnetic 'part' and an electro 'part', and if you coiled enough of it together millions and millions of times in a certain state, maybe you'd have an atomic particle that contained a phenomenal amount of energy, and a tiny amount of mass.",1249054926

Based on what evidence?<p>I have studied (in chronological order)<p>German (school study, beginning in elementary school)<p>Russian ("" "", begun in secondary school)<p>Esperanto (self study, begun in secondary school with a friend from my Russian class)<p>Modern Standard Chinese (school study, begun in university)<p>Cantonese ("" "", begun in university)<p>Biblical Hebrew ("" "", begun in university)<p>Literary Chinese ("" "", begun in university)<p>Attic Greek ("" "", begun in university)<p>Biblical Greek ("" "", begun in university)<p>Taiwanese (self study sometimes with Mandarin-speaking tutor, begun after university)<p>Japanese (self study with Mandarin-speaking tutor, begun after university)<p>Hakka (self study with Mandarin-speaking tutor, begun after university)<p>and some sporadic self-study of Latin, French, Spanish, Indonesian, Mongolian, Aramaic, and other languages, begun and resumed here and there in the above time span. I have been employed for years as a Chinese-English interpreter and translator and read German comfortably.<p>There is nothing particularly easy to learn about Esperanto. In particular, there is nothing particularly easy to learn about Esperanto for native speakers of non-Indo-European languages. One participant on the sci.lang Usenet newsgroup showed, more than a decade ago, that the percentage of Esperanto speakers on the continent of Asia has to be strictly less than 1 person in 1,000. He wasn't axe-grinding for English--he himself was a Han Chinese from Hong Kong, a native speaker of Cantonese, who usually took a kind of pan-Chinese view of linguistic issues. Esperanto's lack of network effects--the paucity of people who speak it or write in it--means a learner who tries to learn it in natural settings by direct exposure finds Esperanto much more difficult to learn than many other languages. It's easy to encounter conversations in French or Spanish (I encountered them frequently when I lived in Taiwan) or German (the same) or even Russian (that was more rare in Taiwan when I first lived there, but is easy here in the United States). It is exceedingly difficult to find live conversation in Esperanto anywhere but in an Esperanto club meeting.<p>Here are some informational questions, for anyone with knowledge of the subject to answer:<p>1) What consumer product, produced anywhere in the world, has product labeling or assembly directions or instructions for use printed in Esperanto?<p>2) What terrestrial broadcast TV station, anywhere in the world, has a regular news program in Esperanto? How about the same for a broadcast radio station?<p>3) What weekly news magazine anywhere in the world with professional journalists on staff publishes in Esperanto?<p>4) What international scientific meetings are conducted regularly with Esperanto as the working language?<p>5) What scientific journal, anywhere in the world, expects articles to be submitted with an Esperanto abstract?<p>6) What hotel, restaurant, or travel agency, anywhere in the world, advertises for new employees who are expected to be fluent in Esperanto?<p>Esperanto's fussiness in grammar and difficulty in learning killed its network effects, and its lack of network effects kills its future prospects for growth. Esperanto's peak number of speakers at a given moment across all time is less than the number of speakers English and Chinese (and probably other languages) each add each year simply by natural increase and voluntary second-language learning.",1249054163

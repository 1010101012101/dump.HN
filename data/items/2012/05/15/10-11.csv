This whole ""how would Michael Bloomberg learning to code help him do is job?"" is a strawman of the most epic proportions.  Of course if you are an executive with a limitless staff to fulfill every possible mundane detail that needs to be taken care of then coding is of no use for you.  Hell, even if it is <i>you have people to take care of the coding</i>.<p>Coding is for the rest of us who don't have our own personal staff.  Coding allows anyone to magnify their own productivity.  And this idea that non-professionals shouldn't write code is ludicrous.  Of course they will write bad code, but it won't be any worse then them taking 100 times as long to do things by hand and probably make harder-to-trace mistakes in the process.  It's pointlessly elitist to suggest that code should only be written by professionals; it's like saying you better hire an architect and structural engineer before you build your own doghouse.",1337079388

Rubinius 2.0, which is in development, will also lack the GIL.<p>You're also very confused about how threading on Ruby MRI 1.9 works. First of all, pure Ruby code in 1.9 can and does execute on multiple OS threads, in parallel.<p>Also, the problem that the Ruby VM still has is that while executing native code, it does not allow a context switch unless that code explicitly informs the VM that it can do a context switch. This is in effect how the global interpreter lock works. The gotcha here is that native extensions that are well behaved, can inform the VM that a context switch is possible. For instance, the older ""mysql"" gem was NOT well behaved, blocking context switches between threads, but the newer mysql2 gem does behave well and works correctly in multi-threading.<p>Right now, if you start a new Rails 3 app, it will work in a multi-threading environment correctly and modern Rails servers are taking advantage of that, unless you install some older gems that haven't been fixed. The biggest problem is that you can't know what libraries are well behaved, but if that's too much of a burden, JRuby is a fully supported platform for Rails and doesn't share the same issue.<p>So like, seriously dude, do some reading.",1337078559

The point is that the world is such that most of the time this is not the case.<p>It does not assume that coding is the goal.  It assumes that there are always various goals that have not been met by existing interfaces or infrastructure.  (i.e. that the ideal in the first point can never be achieved in reality)<p>It doesn't necessarily put the method before the problem.  It's just assuming that the many of the problems faced by a majority of people (or everyone) in western society can be solved with code.<p>His next point speak to professionalism in coding.  In large software projects - you absolutely need professionalism.  But many problems people face don't require large software projects to solve.  I give an example in the linked piece above of a problem I solved with code that certainly didn't need a large software project.<p>His final point - it does not imply this thin membrane between professionalism and being an amateur coder.  In fact - I advocate the complete opposite, yet still think everyone should code.  I'm not sure why he thinks it does imply this - so its hard to argue against him here.  To me it's prima facie not the case.",1337078176

First, 20 minutes is way to short. I have had hour long sessions with several experts since my original blog post and I truly believe that you can only get value from an expert in under 60 minutes if you already have a prior relationship with them and they already understand the basic problem you are trying to solve.  If not, it is going to take 10 - 15 minutes just to get on the same page with them.<p>Look, talking to an expert is not magic. I don't care how good someone is, they aren't going to solve your problem at the drop of a hat even if it is a simple problem just because of the time it takes for context switching and getting up to speed with your background.<p>One last thing. There is a big difference between getting expert advice for higher level strategical or design questions vs. solving an actual coding problem. I think if you are just using an expert for strategical/design issues, you can get a lot of value in an hour. If you are trying to solve a coding problem, you run a serious risk of not getting any value at all for your short time period. How many times have you debugged an issue that you thought was easy, but then ended up taking you 6 hours. There is little chance you would even ask an expert in the first place for a simple problem (i.e. it wouldn't be worth it), so there is likely a pretty good chance that if you are looking for an expert to solve a specific technical problem it is going to take more than 20 minutes.<p>In summary, an hour of expert time is awesome for higher level design and strategy but short periods of time to solve difficult specific technical problems will never work.",1337077990

A farmer these days absolutely needs to read and write. But a bronze age farmer? Not so much.<p>I personally think that one day it will be impossible to function in society without the ability to manipulate and query data. To use Jeff's example, as Mayor of a large city there must be mountains of data that might be relevant to every single decision that is made, and the mayors who can query and gain insight into that data quickly (without having to write a spec and get someone else to do it for them) will eventually be more successful, to the point where all mayors will be expected to be able to manipulate data.<p>There are a number of things that need to happen before that though:<p>Firstly, the tools need to get a LOT better.

The first professions will be the kind of things where Excel is used heavily at the moment (you could argue that Excel is a programming environment). Professions like Marketing, Manufacturing (which will become predominately robot driven at some point) and Medicine (which will become heavily influenced by generic programming) will probably be early adopters. But one day, I think ""programming"" in the sense of giving a ""machine"" a series of logical instructions to follow, will be universal and it will simply be impossible to live a normal life without that skill.<p>EDIT: Fixed ironic typo ;)",1337077464

You should think about teaching kids to paint, rather than teaching them to read. It's not because we want more painters or because painting makes you better at the job you do, but painting helps you to see things from a different (artistic) perspective, to appreciate certain joys and certain other techniques.<p>Sussman has gone on record with a talk titled, ""Why Programming is a Good Medium For Expressing Poorly Understood and Sloppily Formulated Ideas."" That's probably an everyday use of programming which I've not seen, and it's part of what people learn as one of these ""background skills"" in college: how to think of things precisely.<p>I still get a lot of people who are shocked when I teach them relativity. You mean it's <i>not</i> a bunch of mysticism about ""mass is squared light energy""?  You mean you can <i>prove</i> that this Lorentz transformation doesn't lead to paradoxes? You mean you can derive it with high-school geometry plus some simple axioms that I can clearly understand? The only part which is hard to get across is  the causal structure of ""light cones"", because people don't think in intersecting cones. (I have had some success with calling them ""expanding light bubbles,"" with some reference to supernova explosions.)<p>Coming back to clarity, and finding it, programming is a good way to pick up that habit, even if you don't code on a day-to-day basis.<p>There is of course one well-known disadvantage which goes unmentioned in this Coding Horror post: coders are disproportionately more likely to think of legal systems as made of immutable and strict laws. The idea that a judge is supposed to, y'know, <i>judge</i> the human costs of competing legal priorities, and make a decision which is both fair and in keeping with the laws as written -- this discretion seems to be missing. You see this as well with how coders approach pharmacists: it's as if pharmacy was no longer a <i>medical discipline</i> and was somehow relegated to counting pills. No, that's what we code the robots for. Stop equating people with robots.<p>But if we remain sensitive to the humanity of others, then being able to code probably functions to a net benefit, much like Jeff's example of plumbing does. I mean, there are still occasions where you need a professional, but everyone should have disassembled the pipes to their sink at some point in their life, just for the experience.",1337077092

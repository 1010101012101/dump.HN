7319920,comment,7319558,7319558,3,0,batoure,,,"I worked remotely for a US based software company on the island of Guadeloupe in the Caribbean for most of 2010 while my girlfriend taught there. It was pretty fantastic, The major challenge was as you might expect... connection speed and stability. As you can see from the map most of the islands have fiber jump offs:<p><a href=""http://www.connectinghaiti.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.connectinghaiti.com/</a><p>but the challenge is in how local governments regulate them. At the time that I was working there the very best internet money could buy as a consumer on our island was only about 4 MB which made certain types of things challenging. luckily I worked with a company that was in love with the idea of distributed teams, so they maintained virtual desktops in the United States that people could connect to do things where the slow bandwidth might mess with something important. Mainly things like executing code with our main data warehouse.<p>Another thing that you run into is access to a good consumer electronics market. If I am trying to get setup to work from home in the US it is easy to solve little problems, I can order things online and get them the next day or if I am impatient I can go directly to the store and buy usually exactly what I want to solve the problem. This won&#x27;t be the case when you live on a small island, stores hit the general notes but if you are looking for something specific that you will know will solve a problem you may be disappointed. This can also be a risk if your primary machine goes down. I am not saying you should pack for the trip like a survivalist, but its important to think about things that could go wrong ahead of time so that you can plan for contingencies. Again my work being more than accommodating direct shipped me several items that I needed and pulled my ass out of the fire.<p>As to quality of life it can really be amazing. My company generally operated on Pacific time since all of the senior managers lived in California, as a result I would usually get up in the morning go to my surfing lessons lounge a bit then come home at around noon and start working.<p>As I sit typing this I am really starting to wonder why I ever came back to the US..... ::opens new tab to look at plane tickets::",1393606667

It&#x27;s actually the seizure itself which is therapeutic, which should give you an idea of the severity of the conditions it&#x27;s used to treat: ECT is a last-resort treatment which can be lifesaving for severe depression, schizophrenia, or catatonia which are unresponsive to medication. There are less extreme alternatives being studied, but as of today ECT is still the magic bullet in some severe cases.<p>Anyway, this article is not about ECT, but transcranial direct current stimulation. tCDS is a completely different concept that uses much lower voltage, applied continuously in the direction of neuron activation, to promote activity and possibly growth.

But I&#x27;m okay with recommendations by friends - sure they may have been influenced by advertising, but it was good enough for them to recommend it to me. I&#x27;m okay with them filtering all the noise out for me.<p>My argument is not that advertising is all around bad and nobody likes it - in fact I know plenty of people enjoy clever advertising, and probably many people are fine with using advertising as a deciding factor when making purchases.<p>But I don&#x27;t. I&#x27;d rather no advertising influence me consciously or especially unconsciously. I regard most ads as an attempt by a marketing agent to subvert my rationality when I&#x27;m buying a product or service. Of course there&#x27;s no way to get away from it altogether, and nobody is an entirely rational actor to start with. But I&#x27;d like to keep things as best as I can.<p>Additionally, I find even unobtrusive ads distracting. I&#x27;ve found that even seemingly small changes in day-to-day tasks can have an impact on my ability to sustain concentration, think clearly, and keep going to the end of the day. As another example of this, try going one week without listening to the radio on the way to work. That made a large noticeable difference in my workday. I&#x27;ve also found that watching TV, any TV, tends to disrupt my focus a little even hours after watching. So based on my personal experience, I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that ads also have an effect on my concentration throughout the day, albeit a relatively smaller one.<p>Of course YMMV and they really might not influence you at all.",1393606240

Luck of the draw and early adoption are really key to being a mod in r/news or elsewhere. This also leads to abuses that exist likely due to their inability to exert such control elsewhere.<p>>Part of the reason why I like HN&#x27;s moderation is you do not know who is generally doing the moderation work--same goes for places like 4chan if I might say.

Since those variables are often only rough guesses, they can be wrong, and cause misallocation of funds.<p>When you print an additional 2% of the money supply, you are essentially taking about 2% of the entire economy and assigning it to yourself.<p>Back when money was gold, and gold was money, in order to increase the money supply by 2%, you had to mine 2% of all gold already in the marketplace, which required a lot of labor and capital.  If the price of gold was high, you worked more expensive mines.  If it was low, you idled them as temporarily unprofitable.  The effect of the increase on the money supply was diffused throughout the economy by virtue of the sheer amount of work required to accomplish it.<p>With paper money, all that is required is a press and anti-counterfeiting measures.  The transfer of value into the new money is far more concentrated, both in terms of actors and time.  The buying power of the new money is higher, because people don&#x27;t necessarily know how much you printed until you start spending it.<p>It is a great virtue for Bitcoin to make public the exact amount of new money added to the economy.  Monetary inflation can therefore be predicted exactly.  It&#x27;s still inflationary, and does not account for changes in demand to achieve a stable money price.

The explanation of cache seemed a bit too plain and didn&#x27;t give enough context in the article.

Suppose you had a system that was hooked up to a thermometer and reading the temperature from this thermometer takes 1 second.<p>Without caching, every time you asked the system what the temperature was, it would do a new reading from the thermometer. If 1000 people asked the system what the temperature was, it would do 1000 readings, which would take 1000 seconds collectively.<p>With caching, the first time the system was asked, it would do a reading and it would save the reading somewhere it could get it much faster than 1 second, let&#x27;s say 0.01 seconds. For all subsequent readings, it would use the saved reading, until enough time had pasted to do warrant doing a new reading.<p>----<p>Obviously, my version is 3 paragraphs long so it&#x27;s not ideal either :D",1393605457

The goal of the union is to enable the teachers to perform as professional teachers rather than merely supporting them as wage earners.

You can&#x27;t say &quot;Bitcoin #AE472b was stolen&quot; and then trace it through its life, or blacklist it.<p>Instead Bitcoin is a ledger that details wallets and accounts. The origin of balances came from mining, and then people made transactions that, on the official ledger, transferred some or all of those amounts to other wallets. And on, and on, and on.<p>Hypothetically, if the community were foolhardy enough to trust someone&#x27;s list of &quot;recipients of mislaid money&quot; wallet ids, you could blacklist those wallets, or even, through group agreement, force transfers back. But that&#x27;s where tumblers come in: Tumblers are group wallets that take transactions in from all sorts, and then distribute them anonymously to new wallets you control (after a service fee, of course). Anyone hiding their tracks will of course have used a tumbler, often anonymously run on the Tor network. Do you blacklist or reclaim from every wallet that took an output from a tumbler?<p>Bitcoin would be toast. Tumblers are something that legitimate users of the currency make use of. You won&#x27;t get the cooperation of tumbler operators because they are themselves engaged in a very serious crime.<p>So the trace-ability claim repeatedly being made just doesn&#x27;t hold when you have legitimate and illegitimate transactions by the millions all intermixed.

The difference is that Chrome shows a dropdown list while with Firefox you have to sort of remember the values as it does an autocomplete. I see no reason Firefox couldn&#x27;t offer the dropdown since it clearly knows the possible values.<p>By the way, I tried the same font thing in Chrome and it responded the same way, no font list.

Most people haven&#x27;t the slightest clue what they do.<p>I guess that makes &quot;math teacher&quot; the most misunderstood of all :)",1393603249

Conceivably you could sync browsers with someone afar, and then communicate securely by adding bookmarks containing messages and waiting for the browser to sync them. :P",1393603234

He says, &quot;It can only output to intermediate Xamarin libraries, not native ones.&quot;<p>On iOS Xamarin does compile down to native code and on Android is compiled to dex format. They are not interpreted on those platforms.<p>Xamarin can utilize PCL assemblies, so non-ui code could be written once and used multiple places without recompilation. This is actually very handy since those libraries can be built on Windows, where the toolchain is better (IMO VS is better than XS) and the system is more powerful.",1393603220

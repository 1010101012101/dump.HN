Being young isn't the prerequisite to success. Everyone harps and focuses on it because of that trait is unique (remember, likelihood is small) in an otherwise older folks dominated field (remember, likelihood is bigger). ",1190750126

59525,comment,59482,59482,0,0,alaskamiller,,,"I can see his point, there's no incentive for mobile operators to improve when they offer all you can eat service for a singular price. <p>That said, I think it's wrong. Prior to the broadband revolution, people on dial-up were extremely stingy with their attention span and time. Back in the day I had to save up and count down the number of minutes SimCityDemo.zip would download off AOL so that I can time it correctly. <p>But the surge in popularity for this fueled the subsequent revolution. More people saw value in being online and to compete, the service providers gave away more hours. Then more free days. Then more free months. Then faster speed. And now ubiquity.<p>And the consumer interest has only surged. Now people are free to experiment, free to tinker, because of the abundance and availability of access. I may not use any of the stuff shown at TechCrunch40 but I'll at least give it a shot. What do I have to lose? I pay $14.99 for unlimited DSL and $19.99 for unlimited EVDO. <p>Similarly, what's going to cause the mobile revolution to explode in America is more than skin deep. It's not just the pricing, it all has to do with technology and government regulations. Japan's mobile revolution happened years ago, not because their operators competed on tiered services and billing practices, but because they competed on technology and was relatively free of government regulations.",1190749660

59514,comment,59510,59510,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I always considered being ""founder"" status to indicate you have NO salary. At least in the early stages. You pay your bills, then every dime you have left you put back into the company. Basically, the startup is your life, with all of your financial incentives being driven by your equity ownership.<p>But maybe you are referring to early startup employees? I can see what you say being the case in that type of situation, where salary is typically low in exchange for more equity.\n",1190748253

59511,comment,59444,59444,0,0,Goladus,,,"One of the main differences between the facebook platform and the windows platform is that on the web, it costs very little cash for users to leave for something new.  When desktop hardware and OS installations were involved, people stuck with their first choice (which was in large part determined by what was available in local retail stores).<p>It looks like people do the same thing for social networks, because they do invest time into their profiles and connections and such; but it's still far less of an investment than someone typically would have made in a PC back when Microsoft became the dominant desktop platform.  It takes all of 5 minutes and zero dollars to switch from Facebook to Myspace, or Orkut, or whatever.  Even if you had a desktop that could run all of the other competing desktop OS platforms(which wasn't possible for most people) it took a lot of work to switch between them.  If you were already using windows, you didn't even think about using anything else.",1190747928
59510,story,,,17,23,johnrob,"Another reason many startup founders are young - salary",,"A 22 year old founder can take a low salary, and not be too far from the market rate.  What if the market rate for the founder is 300k?  There is no way anyone would take anything near that much salary at a startup.  The older you get, the bigger the sacrifice becomes.  Now, maybe the older founder gets more equity, but any significant amount of equity is still pretty much an all or nothing payout.  The younger founder gets a better deal - salary closer to market, same all-or-nothing equity.",1190747780

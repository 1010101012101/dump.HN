574342,comment,574117,574117,0,0,derefr,,,"The author's postscript was the most interesting part of the article for me. If there were some extra kind of document (defined in JSON, perhaps) that could be attached to an HTML document to supply definitions that would be entered into the DOM, it could be accessed natively from Javascript, and also inserted into the HTML and CSS standards with much less tweaking than a whole separate variable standard just for CSS. For example, it would be possible to simply extend the concept of HTML entities into ""DOM entities"", which could then be copied wholesale by CSS for a nice symmetry: you'd be able to use &(document.variables.foo); in both mark-up languages and have be replaced with the value of the DOM node document.variables.foo. (Actually, you could extend this even further, and just allow arbitrary inline JS in these DOM entities, which gets parsed as the value after their evaluation: &(document.variables.foo + 1). You could also avoid document.variables altogether, if you wish, and just set use &(1 + 1); or &(document.body.style.background-color); or anything else you like. Let's, therefore, call them <i>JS Entities</i>.)<p>The only big design decision would be whether to allow writing to document.variables from JS (or, to rephrase, whether to parse the JS entities permanently upon recognition into their textual values before parsing can continue, or to have them continue to exist as a special kind of DOM node—though rendered as their current textual equivalent—that will reflow the document if their dependent values are altered.)<p>If JS entities aren't parsed away, it would change the way we interact with the DOM entirely—we probably wouldn't bother defining any constants in CSS itself any more; we'd just inject them. It would reverse the data-flow between Javascript and mark-up, even beyond how much AJAX already has: we wouldn't need to set specific things in the DOM, but instead just have those DOM nodes be an observer of our actual, working value. For example, ""document.body.styles.background-color = document.createVariableElement(spinner.color);"" as a line of Javascript would make the background-color of the page ""watch"" the current value of the spinner. In fact, if this method were used, you technically wouldn't <i>need</i> a separate variables.json document, because you could just dynamically create all the JS entities <i>in</i> JS (which is probably how it should be.) However, you could create one on top of JS entities, if you wished, using a library.",1240426649

PBP and the Camel are horribly outdated, and most of PBP's advice was crap when it first came out.  You are going to hate Perl if you follow its advice to the letter.  PBP Perl is the worst of Java mixed with the worst of Perl.  Yeah, that's going to suck.<p>Anyway, as someone who probably writes and maintains as much Perl code as you (just see my 100+ Perl projects on Github), I've found Perl to be significantly simpler to write and maintain than other languages, and I would recommend it over nearly every other language that I have used.  (Cases that I wouldn't recommend it for?  For apps that need to be faster, I would use CL; and for apps that need to be massively concurrent I would recommend Haskell.

It's strongly typed and yes, if you do too much C style stuff it may be a bit harder to navigate but if you stay in a clean OO world it should be very, very similar to Java. Microsoft put out a competent C++ IDE well over a decade ago and Borland has done so as well... It's my personal opinion that IDEs are in general superior to text editors because this integration reduces the cognitive load of solving particular programming problems. People that say eclipse doesn't have a good text editor are being a bit ridiculous - out of the box it is not that great, but there are many 3rd party editor plugins, you could configure shortcut keys however you want and of course extend eclipse... now I am somewhat biased in that I work daily on an eclipse RCP project, so I am already spun up on extending eclipse.

When a car pulls up the capacitor would dump enough juice in it to split the water in minutes.

Although we have a lot of local friends, our family is distributed in San Diego, San Francisco, and Rhode Island. I really enjoy keeping in touch with my family by emailing pictures while I am hiking, etc. in real time as I am experiencing life. I probably send at least two pictures a day. Later, on the phone, the previously sent pictures are something to talk about. Using video Skype or iChat video also helps keep in touch.<p>If I lived in a small town with almost all of my family and friends nearby, then I might agree more with a limited technology lifestyle, but that is not the way it is.",1370797186

5849526,comment,5848113,5849454,2,0,pron,,,"> What you are attributing to superstition (e.g. consuming more leafy greens) is in fact more often than not rational decision making based on admittedly limited information.<p>Perhaps I have not made my case clearly. Magical thinking has two parts: the first is being wrong (although that&#x27;s not essential for magical thinking; it can be accidentally true); the second -- and this is what distinguishes magical thinking and superstition from mere false belief -- is its motivation to action. People believe many things that are wrong, but superstition is the false belief that changes their behavior.<p>My claim is that healthy food falls under the category of superstition, or magical thinking, because people so readily turn what you call limited information into action. What we may think of as &quot;classical superstition&quot;, say fear of black cats, was also based on limited information. I&#x27;m sure there was plenty of evidence to suggest black cats are harbingers of bad luck. So, fearing black cats could be classified as rational action.<p>But fear of black cats, same as the healthy-food religion, is superstition precisely because it is a belief people accept based on lower standards of evidence than they would in other aspects of their lives, and at the same time motivates them to take action. Why? Because they want to believe it. It makes them either afraid or hopeful.",1370796276

It&#x27;s certainly in dispute [1]<p>Either way, it seems your central point has a number of flaws. What you are attributing to superstition (e.g. consuming more leafy greens) is in fact more often than not rational decision making based on admittedly limited information.<p>Will the consumption of vegetables ultimately improve ones health? I don&#x27;t know, let&#x27;s take a more specific example. For instance, take someone interested in positively affecting their likelihood of developing diabetes. A quick google search turns up a study that notes a correlation between increased vegetable intake and a reduced risk of diabetes[2].<p>Of course, increasing intake of green vegetables may mean a decrease in some other substance. Another quick search turns up a research study documenting a link between increased fructose consumption and insulin resistance [3]. Thus, if I were hypothetically interested in positively affecting my insulin response, it would be quite logical to increase my consumption of green vegetables while decreasing my intake of sugar.<p>Is this course of action wrong? Possibly. However, it&#x27;s certainly rational and not exactly &quot;superstitious&quot;. You&#x27;ve defined the term so loosely as to encapsulate even such things as <i>making rational decisions based on limited information</i>. That is certainly <i>not</i> what superstitious really means.

What it&#x27;s about is a conflict of interest at the cellular level. Some cells become individually fit at the expense of the highly specialized civilization called an organism. It&#x27;s not just &quot;growth&quot; (mass effect) that makes them so dangerous, because if it were only that, the cancer would just displace stuff (like a benign tumor which, contrary to the name, can kill you-- especially in the brain, where displacement can be fatal because location/connection matters). In addition to reproduction, cancers steal resources from (and starve) or invade healthy cells and cause organs to fail.<p>The underlying theme isn&#x27;t just &quot;cell growth&quot;. It&#x27;s about cells that override the body&#x27;s mechanisms for coupling individual fitness with the body&#x27;s needs. Much of what makes the disease hard to treat is that cancer cells become increasingly fit (individually speaking) over time, and while systemically damaging the environment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation) works great if it kills all of them, if it doesn&#x27;t, it leaves an even more fit subset alive.",1370795226

Cancer isn&#x27;t one undesirable mutation; a typical cancer cell has at least 5 detectable mutations. It&#x27;s a process.<p>The perversity is that cancer treatments are themselves carcinogenic (of different cancers) because the stress on the body (exposure to cellular toxics) causes faster mutation and creates more opportunities for mutant cells (that thrive amid the toxin, at least differentially) to take over.<p>This is also why cancer can stop responding to treatment. It&#x27;s like antibiotic resistance.<p>People are working on more targeted treatments (including minimally invasive ones like radiofrequency ablation) than the typical systemic chemotherapy.

This gets even better if you use puppet or chef (or even the shell) for provisioning of infrastructure in concert with vagrant.<p>Doing the same thing with snapshots and VM clones with VirtualBox alone is similar to zipping your project periodically as a backup strategy. Yeah,, it works, but it has no granularity.<p>Bottom line though, it feels very liberating at any point to be able to flip the fuckit bit, do a vagrant destroy and vagrant up and just start over. It makes for painless experimentation on your VM, among other things. Once you&#x27;ve got what you want, you can formalize it in your Vagrantfile, puppet manifests or other versioned artifacts of development.<p>Is good.",1370794158

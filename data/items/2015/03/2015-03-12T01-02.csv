Yes, guns are taken from minorities when an authoritarian regime decides to turn a ghetto into a death camp. And you know why? Because they have zero power already. The system is very thoroughly rigged against them. Those guns aren&#x27;t going to help them. What could a handful of rioters do? If they fight, they might win a few days reprieve. And then the army rolls right over them.<p>You can&#x27;t solve that kind of problem by escalating firepower.

- already knowing partial application and that you can use backticks to take advantage of it in Haskell
- just knowing what pointfree means
- knowing about hoogle
- knowing how to search hoogle and what type of function you needed
- having an interest in the asthetics of your code leading to experimentation that seems pointless but teaches you a lot
- having confidence/knowledge of being able to just plugin functions/types.<p>As far as conclusions, I&#x27;m mostly commenting on the conclusions you simply made from the types... what people sometimes call &quot;type tetris&quot;.

To me, this seems to break a fundamental aspect of the language.

Do I quit?",,"This is a throwaway account.<p>About 6 months ago, my startup I co-founded received $1M in seed funding. We raised the money on hype and a smooth talking co-founder. Previous to the funding, we had a bit of traction selling some tech to some large enterprises.<p>Fast forward to today, we&#x27;ve only had 1 more sale over the last 6 months, and the way our pricing is set up, we&#x27;re making pennies per day. We have 2 total clients, and their contracts run out in May. These 2 clients net us about 30 users per week. We&#x27;ve considered pivots, but we can&#x27;t agree on which pivot to go with. We are slated to make about $5,000 this entire year. Our runway gives us until December until the $1M runs out. We&#x27;re not at each other&#x27;s throats, but we know we are failing.<p>Over Christmas, I built a small side project on my own and launched it just to see if it would be a hit. 9 weeks have gone by, and it&#x27;s shown steady growth. It&#x27;s got 1500 active users, people who are logging in every day and spending about 7 minutes on the site per day. It&#x27;s got well over 40k page views per week, growing about 20-40 users per day. Each user performs about 6 events per visit (event = upload a file, make a comment, upvote someone&#x27;s file, make a listing, save for later).  There&#x27;s 1000+ listings with 100,000k+ uploaded files. It doesn&#x27;t make any money, mostly because I have a moral issue with making money on the side while my main startup is doing so poorly. But I could very easily start adding subscriptions or premium features.<p>My dilemma: is this side project good enough to quit my own funded startup? I&#x27;ve already asked my co-founder if he would be interested in this pivot, and he said he wouldn&#x27;t. Do I ride out my main startup while letting the side project grow on its own?<p>Does anyone have any experience or advice on how to quit your own startup?<p>I&#x27;m so damn confused.",1426124314

It&#x27;s a culture I&#x27;m very proud to have been a part of and it produced some great people in many different fields. In contrast, in my programming niche, I frequently feel uncomfortable with the level of aggression and exclusion on display - every comment on a forum seems like you are exposing yourself to ridicule and judgement. Conversely, in pure maths forums, which I also participate in, the atmosphere is far more welcoming, open, patient and respectful of good work. I think the problem is that in computing it is far easier to be a dilettante and much harder to tell the difference. Yes, all communities will have their dicks, but responding with aggression and elitism pollutes the community for everyone and encourages hostile and collective responses from others: be sure that the dicks are a lot better at playing hardball and ganging up together than we are.

If you&#x27;re, like me, bored by all the media sharing rails/django/express webapps out there and want to solve complex problems, like horizontally scaling a highly available backend service, shoot me an email at santi at saucelabs. We&#x27;re looking for SENIOR engineers with experience and interest in distributed systems. DevOps is a smaller part of what we do, but experience is a plus.<p>About Sauce:
Sauce Labs is a SAAS+E2E series C startup in the bay area. We provide an automated testing cloud service so other companies don&#x27;t have to build their own Selenium or Appium grids. We pride ourselves about our values and transparency (<a href=""https://saucelabs.com/our-values"" rel=""nofollow"">https://saucelabs.com/our-values</a>). Oh, and a nice to have these days: we have a real business model!<p>About the Team:
Our CORE team is currently 8 people and we plan to grow in a controlled fashion this year, hiring only excellent people who are excited about what we do. Most of the team is in SF, with some members in EU working on a re-location. We build a highly available service that runs thousands of customer Selenium tests in real time using VMs hosted in our own infrastructure. We own all our hardware and we collaborate tightly with our Ops team to manage it.<p>About our Stack:
Sauce Labs runs on a Python + Twisted stack and we&#x27;re currently discussing technology changes to take it to the next level (Go is a clear option). We use KVM, LXC and VMWare for virtualization, MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ and other fine tools.",1426122666

But mostly it&#x27;s like this, the Natrona Heights, PA steel mill just got a very expensive reinvestment and retooling.  It now employs about 600 when it used to employ 4,000.<p>And of those 600, most of those now require fairly technical training while the vast majority of the previous 4,000 jobs could be filled with a basic level of training.<p>So, you need <i>at least</i> 3,400 jobs to materialize out of thin air.<p>Even if I assume that you could magically turn all those people into engineers, until you show me where those 3,400 jobs are, the rest of your arguments are moot.<p>The only retort I ever get is: &quot;Well, they should move.&quot;  Move where?  I can repeat that job-loss ratio for cites all over the US from big to small--Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Allentown, Poughkeepsie, Burlington, etc.  So, you can&#x27;t just move <i>ALL</i> of those city&#x27;s population to Silicon Valley, Boston, and Austin (although the tech folks are trying very hard to disprove that statement with their actions by flooding those areas with people).<p><i>NOBODY</i> has been able to tell me where those jobs that people should move to are.  That&#x27;s because <i>they don&#x27;t exist</i>.<p>> People can still get into a trade..and make good money without going to college..yet all of the stats I&#x27;ve seen show this is not happening. Why?<p>Companies say they want more tradesmen.  What they really want are <i>cheaper</i> tradesmen.  I don&#x27;t see salaries rising in the US, at least, so the job rate is at rough balance.<p>> So you push for open source and new technology, which reduces jobs, and now expect a bailout from the middle class?<p>I certainly don&#x27;t wish to reverse automation--especially in things like steel mills where it replaces very dangerous jobs.<p>However, you can&#x27;t just hang people out to dry either.  Education doesn&#x27;t magically make a job appear (just ask the non-technical PhD&#x27;s about that).",1426122663

However Google maps only considers the city-center subwayswhich form about 25% of the entire systemto be ""rapid transit"", although from a user's point of view there's very little difference between subways and most other rail lines in Tokyo (they generally use similar scheduling, rolling stock, stations, and even station spacing in many cases).  So enabling the transit option in Tokyo highlights subways, but it actually <i>de-emphasizes</i> many other (essentially equivalent) rail lines!<p>The only thing I can think of is that the design of this feature was based on the  particular city (e.g. NYC), and then sort of slapped onto other locations without a whole lot of actual thought... :(",1355395915

4915155,comment,4914344,4914708,7,0,omegant,,,"Airbus pilot here. Electronic interference in take off and landing is real. It is pretty common and can indeed be pretty dangerous. The fact is that a tablet or smartphone in flight mode is not an issue as arent devices that are not transmitting.\nThe biggest problem (maybe the only one) is that when you approach the airport and reduce your speed and altitude, the cell phones begin to receive the signals from ground antennas and start trying to connect again with the maximum power(the airplane body dampens the signals), imagine this taking place with dozens of mobile phones at the same time. Also there is people who tries to call or send a message while in approach, making it worst.<p>While on cruise there is no signal with modern 3g, also you go too fast to lock any tower so you dont get the interferences. With old analog cell phones it was pretty usual to maintain signal and talk even at 30k feet (they affected flux sensor of the compass though).<p>This heavy transmission from tens of phones at the same time may or may not cause radio communication interferences (the same one you hear when your phone is close to the car radio annoying but not lethal), system computers reboots or complete loss of flight computers (and this can be very scary in bad weather, heavy traffic airport and close to the ground).\nThis has happened to me while in a landing in Paris, not something that I would recommend. Also a friend of mine had all the flight computers, alarms and lights going wild while trying to land at Madrid too. Usually is less dramatic than that, and only a computer or system resets, but you dont know when or how you are going to face it and how bad will become.<p>The problem with flight modes is that a significant portion of passengers dont know how to set it. Some of them dont even know how to power off their phones, with the stewardess having do it  2 or 3 times each flight(improving lately, it seems people begin to know their devices).<p>Maybe with an 3g antenna inside the plane, all the signals could be kept at low levels and this way be able to avoid interferences to the flight equipment.",1355393866

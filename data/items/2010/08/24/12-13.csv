1629611,comment,1626305,1627408,0,0,Ayjay,,,"I really haven't seen this problem, like, ever. All coder's are vastly more likely to preoptimise the hell out of everything, and we end up with the opposite problem - thousands of hours of wasted programmer time won't even reach 1 saved hour of user time. Bear in mind as well that the actual speed of execution isn't always the main cause of perceived slowness - if something runs 10 times as slowly, but runs in the background and never causes the user to wait, it's actually running infinitely faster, from the users perspective.<p>A much better solution is to write things in the easiest way for coders to change - that way, when something is found to be the actual cause of slowness, anyone can easily go in and optimise it or move it to a background thread. Optimising EVERYTHING in the hopes of obtaining speed is a fool's errand - due to the 90/10 rule, 90% of the code you optimise will never be the bottleneck.<p>--\nAyjay on Fedang/coding",1282654729

1629608,comment,1629212,1629540,0,0,ramit,,,"Let's be careful here. Patrick, you and I both know how the conversion models in this area work, and while the info-marketing world is filled with scammy sleazebags, there are also some very credible ones.<p>For example, I sell information products as well as a New York Times best-selling book. My students do very well, whether it's learning how to automate their finances or earn more via freelancing. If they don't, they request a refund and I eat any costs of my online products.<p>Virtually every info-marketer offers generous guarantees and has to live up to their product's hype...or they go out of business. This is an extremely competitive area.<p>Vaksel, let me also offer some feedback on your numbers. You're analyzing them without knowing how the field works, and frankly every Web2.0 company could learn a LOT from studying the direct-response field. Want to know how to increase your AOV by 200% or 300%? How about finding undiscovered 6-figure revenue sources in your business (like I did 2 months ago)? Why not look to the people who have been doing this for decades?<p>You assume that most of the money is made from the sale of the ebook itself. That's not correct. Most of the revenue is actually made from the ""back end,"" or other products that are either cross-sold, upsold, or repeatedly sold. Every direct marketer knows that you profit more from having a dedicated group of customers who buys from you time after time...which is why the very best ones take INSANE care of their customers. I'll speak for myself, but I continue to send lots of free material to both my free users and my customers. I email them free stuff. I call them. I write them hand-written cards (seriously).<p>As a result, on the rare occasion when I sell something, I can sell it for premium prices (often 100x more than my competitors charge for their products) and people happily pay it because they trust me and they know it's the best.<p>Here's another example. I know an info marketer who pays a 200% commission for any affiliate who sells his book. So if you sell his $27 ebook, you get $54. How does he afford that? Because he's systematically built a funnel that offers his customers more products <i>that they want and are willing to pay for,</i> making it a simple no-brainer customer-acquisition cost -- even at 200%.<p>A skilled direct-response marketer could take a $27 ebook and turn it into $500 of LTV...and the customer would be DELIGHTED to pay it if the material is of outstanding quality.<p>IMHO, a lot of Web2.0 companies should stop poo-poohing marketing and learn how it really works. Virtually every Web2.0 company should be doing upsells, cross-sells, and partnerships...and as a guy who co-founded a venture-backed startup and know a lot of other startup CEOs/marketers, I know that very, very few do.<p>I've put together several bookmarks that might be interesting:<p>* <a href=""http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/emarketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/emarketing</a> (direct-response stuff)<p>* <a href=""http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/marketing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/marketing</a> (general marketing)<p>* <a href=""http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/monetization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://delicious.com/ramitsethi/monetization</a><p>Hope this helps.",1282654652

1629605,comment,1629270,1629270,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"I don't think there's a bubble at all.  The original tech bubble happened because companies IPO'd really early, and Joe Average Investor took equity out of his home or took cash advances on his credit cards and invested it in high tech stocks.  This inflated the value of those stocks, causing more Joe Average Investors to pour money into high tech stocks.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat until mid-2000 when that cycle collapsed.<p>There are precious few IPO's right now.  And, the people investing in startups right now are accredited investors i.e angels and VC's.  There isn't money rushing in from Joe Average Investor in the US, because by law they can't invest in a non-publicly traded company.<p>Angels and VC's plan on a bunch of companies in their portfolio failing.  They typically expect to lose money on %40-70 of their investments, break even on %30 of their investments and hopefully make a 2X to GoogleX return on their money on the %10-30 of the companies that ""succeed"".<p>There are around 250,000 millionaires in the San Francisco Bay Area and 600,000 millionaires in NYC.[1]  That's a huge pool of people that can afford to write a check for $25-50k without really hurting if they lose that money.  A lot of those people are also increasingly willing to write a check to a couple of entrepreneurs with a promising product and a bit of traction.  Why?  Because they would rather do that with some of their wealth rather than pay a professional money manager %3 of their investment a year to manage their money for them.<p>ref [1]: <a href=""http://www.us.capgemini.com/news/current_news.asp?ID=840"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.us.capgemini.com/news/current_news.asp?ID=840</a>",1282654567

Either (1) absorbing his good information, or (2) trying to figure out how the bad stuff could be marketed so well. (2) is more meta-learning, but I start asking questions like, ""Who does this appeal to? Why is this worded/marketed like this?"" Etc. Sometimes I learn more from bad information, because it forces me to reconsider the level of complexity writing should be if you want to sell in volume (very, very low - dumb it down 10x... okay, now make it dumber) and things of that nature.",1282651980

I strongly believe it is google's job to ensure that their work is of good quality. This is similar to Wikipedia errors that find their way into newspapers and even research. The difference is that wikipedia isn't claiming to be a reliable source. Google is trying to build an exhaustive catalogue and they are the only one allowed to distribute a large amount of text due to a court settlement. Good metadata should be part of that deal.<p>And like the article mentioned, there already exist much better catalogues (or whatever they are called) such as the library of congress one.

Hardcovers (perceived as high value items) come out first, then are superseded by successively cheaper/smaller paperback editions after early-adopter demand is saturated by the high priced product. Unfortunately the pricing model is conflated with the physical product's format, and with the distribution channel (trade vs. mass market), which muddies the water enormously. (I'd love to do an ebook edition that launched at, say, $20, then dropped in price by 5% per month until hitting a floor of $4. It'd be interesting to graph sales against time ... but unfortunately the accounting procedures in place in the publishing business, and locked in via contract, seem to make this impossible without either (a) self-publishing or (b) protracted negotiations with a legal department that are not dissimilar to kicking a dead sperm whale up a beach.

Working at a corporate job is so darn easy that I have plenty of brain power to work on my entrepreneurial ideas after dinner through the night.<p>Of the start-ups that have approached me my biggest issue has  always been that I did not believe in their idea.

189936,comment,189830,189916,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Frugality is just a basic life skill.  It serves you well in anything.<p>However, I'm beginning to notice now that our customer base has grown and our revenues have doubled a couple of times over since our time in YC that what used to seem extravagant (paying people to do things for us) is now becoming the smartest way to make problems go away.  I just paid Google $500 yesterday to handle search on our site, because it is a problem that has effected me on a couple of occasions, and I decided that even one more day of me fighting with full text search in MySQL and PHP (which is not a comfortable language for me to work in, as I use Perl mostly) was one day too many--the opportunity cost was just too high, when that one day spent talking to customers could close a deal worth many times the $500/year that I pay for Google Custom Search.<p>But, that's frugality of another kind (one that considers the value of both time and money), of course, so it doesn't invalidate the idea that frugality is pretty much always a net win.  I just thought it worth mentioning since I've seen plenty of entrepreneurs take frugality too far.  Colocating their own box instead of renting a server in order to save $10/month, for example...if you have a single hardware problem during the 18-36 months that the server is in service you end up with a raw deal (because you either have to go to the colo and deal with it, or hire the colo service folks at $100/hour to deal with it).  If it's not the focus of your business, try to find someone else who does have that as their focus to do it for you.  Work on your differentiating factors, not the day-to-day crap that every business has to have.",1210794929

Rarely does the debate rise to the level where it is acknowledged that sometimes good laws have unintended absurd consequences, and that just because a law prevents <i>you</i> from doing something you want to do, doesn't mean that the law is invalid (or an inappropriate intrusion of government into daily life).",1210794608
189923,comment,189830,189893,0,0,xlnt,,,"Maybe this is because excessive spending is caused by not thinking carefully and precisely about all the factors relevant to the startup, whereas frugality comes from trying to maximize everything to one's benefit.

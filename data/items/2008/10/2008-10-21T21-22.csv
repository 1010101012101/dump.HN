339429,comment,339081,339154,0,0,jmatt,,,"Maybe it's just me but I would recommend that he start with a classic CS book and work back to python and the like. Something like ""The C Programming Language"". I learned more with a book like this than any modern ruby or python book. Plus the world will need C programmers for a long time. Knowing C is one of those skills that will be useful anywhere. If you know C you arguably can learn C++, C# or Java quickly and easily. And you'll have a respectable fundamental understanding of how computers work. Though I do agree that this is specific to this case. If it were a kid in high school in Northern California... it may be a different story.<p>The C Programming Language, Second Edition

339423,comment,339127,339409,0,0,unalone,,,"<i>Are you somehow saying that a band is in some way equivalent to a book?</i><p>A songwriter and a novelist are both instances of artists. Such is my point: there are more levels of entry for writers nowadays.<p><i>Songs are just emotional, they don't transfer any information.</i><p>Several bands I listen to weave complex narratives into their music. Similarly, several novelists I read transfer very little information through their novels. Your statement is not entirely accurate.<p><i>You can absorb ideas by reading that you cannot by watching movies.</i><p>Of course! But you must remember that <i>the opposite is true as well</i>. Movies can convey things that books can't possibly attempt to show. The same with music, for that matter.<p><i>Movies run at their own pace, books run at your pace.</i><p>Of course. But that's irrelevant to my argument, which is that the book is no longer the only place to which writers flock. If you're young and want to write, a novel isn't the only thing you can write anymore. Just as people with ideas for scenes sometimes write movie scripts now rather than plays. A friend of mine is like that: I write play scripts, he writes movie scripts. If movies didn't exist, he might have become a playwright instead. Similarly, somebody who would have been a blogger 5 years ago might subsist entirely on Twitter or even Facebook Notes now.<p>I would also mention the TV show as a counterpoint to what you said, wherein episodes become almost chapters. You can either watch slowly, once a week, or you can watch it in massive doses when the DVD comes out. I just watched Twin Peaks like that last week.<p><i>It's NOT easier to make a movie. A movie is a masive logistical effort</i><p>I never said it was <i>easier</i>, I said it was <i>an option</i>. And it's easier for movies to convey certain types of information.<p><i>Forming bands is just a trendy thing, but most bands I know produce silly music. They say banal things.</i><p>Look at Stephin Merritt of the Magnetic Fields as a perfect example of somebody who uses the lyric to greatest advantage. But either way, <i>that's not my point.</i> People who want to write nowadays very often write lyrics. I'd say more write lyrics nowadays than write novels, or poetry. That means that the pool of poets and novelists is less, because people have more venues to follow through.<p><i>Writing is still the backbone of human thought. In whatever form it comes - the well thought out written word will always accompany human civilisation.</i><p>Of course. I never said it wasn't, or that it wouldn't. But words appear in multiple mediums. David Foster Wallace said in interviews that he thought the best-written thing of this last decade was The Wire. I think the best-written thing I've read was either Achewood, which is a comic, or House of Leaves, which borders on visual art. Things branch out, and that's the point I wanted to make.",1224626027

339413,comment,339127,339396,0,0,unalone,,,"I self-published a book in my senior year of high school, so yes. That's possible.<p>However, I referred to the set of genres overall. The book certainly is not dead. However, it takes up less of the ""fine arts"" market proportionally than it did a hundred years ago, and that's because other genres exist that allow people certain other freedoms.<p>It is easier to form a band now than it was a hundred years ago. A hundred years ago, it would have been extremely difficult, and there was less of a popular focus. There wasn't the insane level of attention to rock stars back then. And motion pictures didn't exist at all. Neither did animated pictures or video games.<p>This is applicable to the blogging situation as follows: 5 years ago, if you wanted to write online, a blog was the best way to go. Now? Not necessarily. Now you can Tweet if that serves your purpose, or you can maintain a videolog or a tumblelog. Many friends of mine abandoned their blogs for Tumblr for precisely that reason: it fits their needs. And yes, that's still technically a blog, but the format has changed. There are different rules and there is focus on different things. It's entirely different from maintaining a blog on Wordpress or Movable Type.<p>Nowadays, I don't see very many interesting posts from personal blogs. The blog posts I DO find interesting come from only a few places. The attention has changed to a variety of different mediums. Look at r/bestof/ on Reddit: suddenly, there are people who come to attention entirely through metaposting. Or, to take my example, I now link to my HN threads on my site and I've abandoned my blog for essays. It lets me build up a better relation between content that I write on the fly and content that builds up, that I slowly formulate and revise.<p>Of course the book isn't dead, or even dying, though in my opinion it's been 50 years since the last truly revolutionary piece of pure literature (Beckett). However, now if you've got a mind for expression there are more writing-based venues available. 100 years ago, you either wrote poetry, wrote novels, or wrote plays. Now you have lyric writing, film-writing, and game writing available. That fits what people want much more.<p>Look at the invention of science fiction: when movies first appeared, literature stopped dealing with sci-fi largely for several decades, because the minds that were attracted to sci-fi were attracted to cinema. The same thing is happening with video games right now: not all but many writers are joining on the science fiction game bandwagon. And so, if I were a game designer looking at a bunch of college students interested in science fiction, I might very well advise the students that novel writing might NOT be the best way to go on with sci-fi. Some people would ignore that and go on and try, but with so many other venues available, there's less of a pressure for books. That's how I see this article: it's an argument that a blog isn't necessary anymore. That doesn't mean people won't like it, and use it, but it means that blogging is no longer the primary source of content on the Internet.",1224625496

Even if you only use mobile extensions it's trivial to write an extensions.conf script to play ""Press 1 for sales, 2 for support"" and have it ring different queues depending on keypress. If your company has any telephone needs at all this should be on your short list. IVRs, Conference rooms, automated phone status updates, queues, voicemail via email, and on and on. If you have two offices that would communicate by long distance (even/especially international), you can set up an IAX trunk and connect the sites for free.<p>The company I work for scaled from two people on the queues to 15+ desks+cells and counting -- 50 employees to 1500+ with only the most minor tweaking. For a while we also had IAX trunk links to major vendors and other companies that we spent a lot of phone time with.<p>I can't recommend it enough.",1224623085

(I like to think I wasn't trolling(!) because what I said was my honest opinion). Also I think for a forum discussion not to quickly disappear down the toilet you have to assume the best of people.<p>Regarding what you actually said, I'll have to do some more investigating/thinking. I will concede you seem more knowledgeable than myself on this matter however the INTP in me won't concede defeat until my spidey senses stop tingling! I'll let you know if it does.<p>(I do like the evolutionary analogy. I think they're extremely apt).",1224623064

I didn't like the old big keyboard: the new ones feel wonderfully responsive to me. The heat is a problem, but I guess I'm biased, because I rarely have my computer on my lap. I keep it on my desk or in my bed. And I use a fan program to speed up my fans when I need to, and it usually works.<p>The proprietary formats are a pain, yes, but that doesn't affect me very often. With iTunes, I get most of my music from other sources. I have perhaps 10 CDs that I got from iTunes, and that's mostly from Plus, so it's open enough to send to other people. Everything else is MP3 and MP4, which means - among other things - I can click and drag songs to iChat and it works.<p>The mail import took me a long time, for Gmail. But it imported my other emails first, and with Gmail it imported mostly the archived email, so I could use it right out of the box. I don't use Maildir, so mail works pretty much beautifully for me.<p>What does that optimization do for the fonts? Do you have an example? And either way, I'd take the Apple default fonts over anything else I've seen to date. I'd kill to keep Zapfino.",1224622970

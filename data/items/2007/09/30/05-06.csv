The catchy slogan (front page of the web) was pure PG.  But how the actual site would function came about while Steve and I toiled in our Medford apartment.  Perhaps the biggest inspiration was actually del.icio.us/popular -- we thought that site (albeit a byproduct of the actual site) was on to something.<p>We really had never heard of digg until we'd already been online for a month and change, but by then reddit had already developed a unique identity.  I believe that ignorance turned out to be quite an advantage.  <p>We just tried to build the best site we could.",1191131988
61231,comment,60228,60409,0,0,kn0thing,,,"Yep.  Our original startup (based on Steve's idea from a trip to a gas station in central VA) was mobile-based and 100% rejected by YC.  Heh.<p>We left that meeting with PG (Steve and I still have the notes in our notebooks) aiming to build a ""front page of the web.""  And we didn't have a clue as to what it'd look like.

61229,comment,61071,61071,0,0,herdrick,,,"Wikipedia uses the wrong criterion.  Instead of asking of an article, ""Is this notable?"" they should ask ""Is this useful?"" If so, let it remain.  This is much more elegant than their  already large body of law  (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_guidelines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Wikipedia_notability_g...</a>) and precedent (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log/delete</a>).  It works for edits too; you just ask, ""Does this edit add or subtract utility?""  <p>The usefulness criterion would allow promotional articles and edits.  Automated spam should still be deleted, but promotional handwritten stuff that contains some facts is better than nothing.  Subsequent edits can remove the spamminess.  <p>Of course, this means an article on any topic is OK.  In a web encyclopedia, that's the right thing.  ",1191129847

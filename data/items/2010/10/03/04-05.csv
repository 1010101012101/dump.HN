The issue I see, is that what you are asking in wanting companies to engage in philanthropy, is to have the companies live at your behalf.

People that want the rich to be more involved in philanthropy are not necessarily doing so just to get a ""warm and fuzzy feeling because they had a part in it"" or some such nonsense. Simply wanting rich people to, say, I don't know, help people doesn't mean that the ""wanter"" actually believes he has a part in the philanthropy. The idea that just selling beverages and storing up billions of dollars helps people more than selling beverages and giving some of those billions away to actually help people is naive.

Out of 10 new geniuses 8 will go to Facebook, one to Google, one to Apple. Facebook is smaller (you can get a bigger project immediately), at Facebook your commits go live at the second day on the job (""Move fast and break things""), Facebook options are much more attractive, and also working for Facebook can get you laid (seriously, working there has much more sex appeal than working at other tech companies).<p>Because Facebook can snap the cream of the next generation of talent, it will be in ideal position to take on any big opportunity over the next 5 years.",1286078850

As an essayist, his prose is about as far from PG's style as possible... which is exactly why I'm suggesting it.<p>Off the top of my head, he goes into extensive, gratuitous quasi-intellectual breakdowns of everything from MTV's The Real World to G'n'R cover bands.<p>In the chapter on sugary breakfast cereals, Chuck notes that ""an inordinate number of cereal commercials are based on the premise that a given cereal is so delicious that a fictional creature would want to steal it."" Have truer words ever been written? He continues:<p>""Being cool is mostly ridiculous, and so is sugared cereal. That's why we like it.""<p>""I eat sugared cereal almost exclusively. This is because I'm the opposite of a 'no-nonsense' guy. I'm an 'all-nonsense' guy. When a button falls off my shirt, I immediately throw it away and buy a new one. I can't swim; to me, twelve feet of water is no different than twelve feet of hydrochloric acid. However, I <i>can</i> stay awake for 72 straight hours. When flipping channels during commercial breaks, I <i>can</i> innately sense the perfect moment to return to watch I was watching. So the rub is that I have all these semicritical flaws and I have these weirdly specific gifts, and it seems like most Americans are similarly polarized by what the can (and cannot) do. There are no-nonsense people, and there are nonsense people. And it's my experience that nonsense people tend to consume Cocoa Krispies and Lucky Charms and Cap'n Crunch (nonsense food, if you will). Consequently, we nonsense types spend hours and hours staring at cardboard creatures like the Trix Rabbit and absorbing his ethos, slowly ingesting the principles of exclusionary coolness while rapidly ingesting sugar-saturated spoonfuls of Vitamin B-12.""<p>If you're still reading... kudos!

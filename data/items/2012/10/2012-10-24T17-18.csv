4694132,comment,4693655,4693655,3,0,graue,,,"This post is pretty overboard with its exaggeration. But one thing I find interesting is the concept that Facebook is a paid publishing platform. They'll deliver your posts to 15% of your followers as a freebie, but to reach 100%, you pay. And I hadn't thought of it that way before.<p>That perspective actually gives me increased hope for Tent (<a href=""https://tent.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tent.io</a>), the decentralized social networking protocol that could one day be a Facebook alternative. When Tent was announced here on HN, a common criticism was that if you're popular, and you host your Tent server yourself, you end up paying a lot for the bandwidth cost of sending each post to thousands or millions of followers. Whereas the perception is that on a centralized social network you can send a post to millions of followers for free.<p>For now, that's still the case on Twitter, but on Facebook, apparently not. If you really want significant reach, you pay to publish even to people who already (by liking) signed up to follow you. So the situations aren't actually that different. I guess there really is no free lunch.",1351101492

Performance is about time-based metrics such a requests-per-second.  Scalability is about the question of whether I can add more hardware proportionately to my request load and continue to perform.  WPEngine's marketing claims are about scalability, not performance.<p>This guy's WPEngine code was apparently doing a 189k row sort when serving certain requests, which is not going to perform well on any hosting platform, including DIY.",1351101440

example: adobe> pays versioning costs every 24 months<p>Provided you shrink the window of analysis, you can say ""already paid for inventory, just amortizing it"".  But in that case, you <i>don't have unlimited supply</i>, you just have whatever you paid for.<p>In the case of adobe, despite having ""unlimited copies"" of CS5, they would (eventually) run out of supply of salable product if they did not version into CS6.  So while its trivially true they could make unlimited copies of CS5, its not a great idea to perceive this as unlimited supply.  The supply that matters is the part people are willing to pay for--this is the marginal information content-- not the marginal bit content of what is delivered.<p>In some ways I don't think we're disagreeing, just focusing on different elements of the analysis.  My larger point was exactly that -- keep in mind the broader elements that are considered as relevant by CxO.<p>THe CEO of adobe makes decisions, for examople, about how often to incur the marginal cost of versioning the next Creative Suite, how rapidly and how much to budget, etc. COO of facebook looks at the marginal cost of data centers for the next 200 million users, etc, in part because s/he is looking at timeframes and scales which are not the same at the level of a project team, etc.",1351101388

4694117,comment,4684505,4689524,3,0,lotharbot,,,"While the Bible definitely shows a pattern of preaching to specific groups, as soon as there's an organized religious system, there's a method for outsiders to receive full benefits.  Moses allowed foreigners to participate in passover (Ex 12:48) and other sacrificial ordinances (Ex 22:18).  While certain rites were only performed by priests, who were from a particular family, the benefits of those rites applied to everyone in the nation (see Num 15:25-26).  Likewise, immediately after Jesus' resurrection, both Jewish and non-Jewish believers received the same spiritual gifts (Acts 10:45) and the same salvation (Rom 1:16, Gal 3:28).<p>Interestingly, the early LDS allowed blacks full membership with no limitations (for example, Elijah Abel was a black LDS priest in 1832.)  The Book of Mormon describes blacks as cursed (2 Nephi 5:21) but allowed to come to the Lord just like anyone else (2 Nephi 26:33).  And it makes the anti-racism statement ""revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins"" (Jacob 3:8-9).  Joseph Smith himself was an abolitionist (D&C 101:79).<p>But Brigham Young declared that if Utah received statehood, it wouldn't be Congress' business whether or not they had slaves or how they treated them (Journal of Discourses 4:39-40).  He also stated that the penalty for mixed marriage is death on the spot (JoD 10:110), and that blacks couldn't hold the priesthood until after all of the whites did, at which point they would actually turn white (JoD 7:290, 337).  Wilford Woodruff (4th LDS prophet) said that the only way someone in a mixed marriage could have salvation was to be beheaded, and for all of his children to be killed as well; there's no ""proxy baptism"" option present here.<p>By the 1950s, the common view was that blacks were cursed because they had not behaved valiantly in the pre-mortal existence, but that they would eventually receive full blessings.  Then in 1978 a ""revelation"" allowed blacks to hold the priesthood.  There are still some vestiges of the 1950s view, though; a friend told me of someone else in his mission who, after visiting a non-committal black family, complained that ""n___ers were fence-sitters in the pre-existence and they're fence-sitters now"".<p>So, as you say, it's complex.  Official LDS doctrine (specifically coming from ""prophets"") regarding blacks went from a little racist to extremely racist to kinda racist to not racist.  Individual LDS attitudes have always had some variability.",1351101278

4694112,comment,4692456,4693585,10,0,davesims,,,"""From a customer service perspective, this comment leaves a really bad taste in my mouth.<p>You guys say right on your home page that you're ""infinitely scalable."" [...] The (strong) implication being that any WordPress configuration will perform better on WPEngine than on an alternative hosting platform.""<p>I agree with your general point that, from the standpoint of the entrepreneur, ""the customer is always right"" should be words to live by. On the other hand, in the paas industry, it should be axiomatic, i.e., understood by all competent parties, that horizontal scaling (the ""infinitely scalable"" bit) manifestly will NOT address problematic architectures, n+1 queries, full table scans, poorly/non-indexed schemas, etc.<p>This, to me, is not blaming the customer, it's laying out in reasonable terms assumptions any competent developer or software entrepreneur should understand long before they employ a paas.<p>Your larger point, though, is valid: even after bracketing the given assumptions of what the responsibility of a paas truly is, better communication up front could temper expectations as to what ""infinitely scalable"" (a bold phrase, to be sure) really means to the individual customer. It doesn't mean a paas can fix a application that locks the datbase for a full second per query, etc. It does likely mean (I'm assuming here, I have no experience with WPEngine) spinning up new instances and handling increased loads should be Heroku-simple.<p>In this case, I think WPEngine is taking the hit for what they should (bad communication on the support side) and explaining in real terms what paas's can and can't do. There's a difference between ""blaming the customer"" and simply being honest about what the bottom-line issue is. NOT addressing this side of it may have long-term implications if another customer comes along with similar expectations. Being clear about what the client's responsibility is doesn't necessarily equate to ""blame.""",1351101217

How many rows are we talking about here ? I'm sure it's under a billion rows - right ? Partitioning it may help but I think there's something significantly wrong with the way the lookup is going through.<p>The recent comments widget is probably doing things the wrong way around. Is it caching the returned values ? Does it matter if the recent comments widget is based on data that is.. say 2 minutes old ?<p>I really don't agree with your performance bottlenecks. I run several sites much larger (at-least 20x traffic per day) and granted that they do not all run Wordpress, I know from experience that your system should not be grinding to a halt with just 50k daily uniques.<p>Even imagining that the comments lookup is like ""get all comments for post ID, 2966 --"" - that can't possibly be slow enough to destroy your entire server setup. Maybe you just need more RAM ?<p>Get a dedicated box and get someone to optimize it. If your entire database can be in RAM (Get a box with 16GB of RAM ?), that should work well. That won't cost you $250/month even.<p>EDIT: I see from another post:
<i>As Sean, my head SysAdmin wrote on a ticket to you, some of your pages were performing a sort on 188590 rows in memory each time.</i><p>Was that the recent comments widget doing that ? Well, that can be fixed with some clever caching or even a clever fetch technique!<p>Is that necessary for every load ? Do you have a particular blog post with that many comments ? The right way to go about that would be to pick out comments for a particular post and then sort them - query-wise. Again, your WP install probably needs some (much needed) tuning.<p>I understand your desire to have someone else worry about your servers, but someone also (apparently) has to worry about your code, and as I understand right now - that person is you.

You don't want your engineers attending to one person's problem. That's called consulting. You want them building product. Building perfect software is bad from a business point of view. In WPEngine's case, the takeaway from all this is to add a line to the customer requirements list on their website (useful for filtering out the undesirable bottom 5% of customers) that says they will not accept any of the few potential customers that use the native WP commenting system because it's poorly built.<p>I'm not sure if it's true, but based on the poster's description of WPEngine's customer support experience, it sounds like their customer service is the typical poorly structured (from the customer's point of view) customer service experience I've encountered and/or witnessed many times from companies both large and small.<p>Some startups don't provide phone support. It's nice to see WPEngine does. Sometimes you just have to talk with someone to beat it into their heads that you have a complicated problem. They can't email email you back a link to some topic-related doc page and move on. They're on the phone with you and they have to make meaningful progress before hanging up.<p>In the case of email support, 95% of the tickets are answered with a link to a doc page and that's the end of the case. The metrics are excellent and every pats themselves on the back. 95%! And the volume was soooo high! Acknowledging positives is necessary, but measuring failure requires different metrics and 95% success does not necessarily imply 5% failure because each one uses different metrics. You think the the metrics on their dashboard will take into account this thread, for example?<p>The system breaks down when the customer has a more serious problem. It takes support a few emails back and forth to realize it. The case is handled by random folks based on availability, further degrading the experience. The person who'll pick up your latest reply to the thread isn't going to thoroughly read the whole thread, and by this point you've interacted with five support staff already. Finally, they realize it's outside their control and pass it off to Engineering, where it languishes for a month. Creating a system where the engineer is not allowed to reply directly to the customer but instead has to reply to support who then replies to the customer only removes the stress off the engineer, so they can care less and not solve the problem. Meanwhile, the support staff learn to drop lines like ""Sorry for the delay. We appreciate your patience. The engineers are still looking into it."" without any second thoughts.",1351100544

They weren't always responsive (sometimes we wouldn't get a response for a day, or we would be waiting on hold for a long time), and we ran into the problem of different support people telling us different things about how their system was setup.

WPEngine claimed that other customers of theirs used the same membership plugin without any issues.

Unfortunately, WPEngine refused to refund us fully for the 2 months we wasted trying to get our site setup because we went past the 60 day money-back period. (We had paid for the 3rd month already, and they gave us a partial refund of that month only.) It was a relatively small amount of money, but after all the trouble we had with them it would have left a much better impression if they would have refunded the entire cost we paid.<p>I'm sure that WPEngine has thousands of happy customers, and our experience was largely unique, but there are many things I felt they could have done a better job of.",1351099317

You can look to the Openwall GPU password cracking project for illustration of how. It is easier to speed up SHA2 on a GPU than it is to speed up bcrypt. Scrypt is markedly different from SHA2; it's designed specifically to be difficult to optimize with GPUs (a property bcrypt has only accidentally at present).<p>Moreover: the best practice for using SHA2 as a password hash is to use PBKDF2, which is <i>not</i> simply iterating SHA2 (you can learn more about PBKDF2 on Wikipedia).

However this requires twice the memory usage during a restart.<p>* There are ways to script Unicorn to make it restart process-by-process, but this requires some effort.<p>* Phusion Passenger Enterprise implements rolling restarts with a single config option (PassengerRollingRestarts on), and it performs process-by-process restarting so that you don't need twice the memory usage. It automates <i>everything</i> for you.<p>* The ""deployment error resistance"" feature, which can be used in combination with rolling restarting, ensures that in case your new app version doesn't start, it keeps the old processes around until an administrator manually tells it to restart again.<p>There are many other features in Phusion Passenger Enterprise which Unicorn does not implement (e.g. live IRB console), or that we implement better. Take a look, you may like it.<p>We are flattered that you like Unicorn. Being Unicorn contributors ourselves, it's always good to see people contend with technology that we've contributed to. :) Phusion Passenger 4 is the combination of all the experience that we've built up in the past few years, in both Phusion Passenger and Unicorn.",1351099106

4693924,comment,4692456,4692456,10,0,brokentone,,,"I run one of the largest WP installs outside of WP.com, and we've seriously struggled with performance issues. Sounds like a lot of this complaint is a WP design/performance issue. If you're looking to be create a WP serving platform, it will require a huge amount of custom configuration, a huge amount of hardware (even with the best caching), regular DB maintenance and reconfiguration, and core hacks. Automattic redirects the core dev when they need something, generally only enough to add their hooks, then they write a plugin, release it to the community, but always keep it a few versions back (HyperDB support for 3.4 anyone?)<p>The WP core team doesn't write code with performance, scalability, orthogonal design, good standards or any such thing in mind and you regularly hit gotchas. However... if you sign up to be a WP platform, you're kinda asking for it.<p>Obligatory performance tips:
1. Cache the heck out of it. CDN, varnish, optcode (APC), query caching on MySQL.
2. As has been noted, file stat'ing is massive. You have to have an exclusive install as close to each serving node as possible, even with optcode caching.
3. Core hack - Modify admin comment searching. Does 5 column wildcard lookups across the entire table. Not scalable. (<a href=""http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20487"" rel=""nofollow"">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20487</a>)
4. Core hack - Remove content reallocation on user delete. With large user tables, you lose the ability to delete users (core fix pending: <a href=""http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19867"" rel=""nofollow"">http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19867</a>)
5. Clean and optimize your DB regularly - Old post revisions are a huge gain
6. Add indexes intelligently - WP doesn't include all the indexes you need
7. Horizontally scale your DB (whether through MySQL clustering, or HyperDB + DBs with roles)
8. Tune everything. I've found that NGINX/Apache and Percona/MySQL make little difference, but setting the right config for each daemon makes huge difference.",1351099016

Bcrypt is not demonstrably any more secure than SHA-512 for example - the difference is in computation time (the Blowfish key schedule is _slow_ by nature).  With enough iterations (1 million? 10 million? It depends on your CPU/GPU architecture targets), the same effect of slowing down the attacker is achieved.  Increasing the number of iterations (and using the output as the next input) is similar to increasing the BCrypt cost factor.  You just have to know your target threshold and pick a number accordingly.<p>Your summary of Level 5 is not quite right - Level 5 is about storing separate chunks of ciphertext - not chunks of the hash's MCF text (MCF = Modular Crypt Format).  You can't even start to brute force a hash if you can't decrypt the ciphertext to begin with.<p>Finally, Stormpath doesn't do anything 'secret' and we go through diligence on these matters with our larger customers.  We're happy to divulge all of our techniques (e.g. how we use multi-factor authentication, how we secure firewalls, etc).

The only downside I can think of is that flushes down the tree when internal buffers get large may cause lower-level pages to become overfull, but if you allow more than one flush operations at each level you can avoid this problem. Of course, that's only important if you are paranoid about internal nodes actually fitting in a page; if you don't care about that, then the worst-case analysis picture looks much better since a flush operation causes at most one flush in the pages immediately below it in the tree structure.",1351098825

The question is: Do you have to pay those costs for each customer, or can you pay them once and amortize the cost over many sales?<p>For example, Adobe Photoshop probably costs a lot to design. It has really high fixed costs, because you need to hire good developers and implement a bunch of advanced operations. However, once Adobe pays the fixed costs, the marginal cost of Photoshop is pretty minimal: packaging, printing a DVD, maybe some marketing. It still costs a lot because the fixed costs are so high, and there's not much competition.<p>Conversely, a plumber has relatively low fixed costs: a truck, some tools, and some training. But plumbers also cost a lot, and this is because they have really high marginal costs: they have to spend an hour at the house of each and every customer.<p>So I agree with you, there may be high costs in acquiring email addresses to sell.

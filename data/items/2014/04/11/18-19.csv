Even with competition, assuming fixed price cabs eventually get driven to extinction, then what? There would be nothing to stop the collusion of existing market competitors (Uber, Sidecar, and Lyft) in order to drive up pricing or perform market division (customer allocation) - that is assuming that monopolies don&#x27;t begin to form in the market as they are liable to do. There is tremendous incentive and pressure from investors for them to both divide markets and fix prices (eg, maximize profit). New firms may enter the market in an attempt to undercut these forces, but they will likely be unable to compete with monopolized pricing by the large companies and thus be driven out of business before reaching any sort of reasonable scale. These kinds of phenomena, far from being anomalies, are the traditional way in which really existing markets work [1][2][3][4][5]. Ultimately, the resolution of such problems occurs not through the markets - which instead create such problems - but instead through the mobilization of state forces (eg. lawsuits and monopoly busting).<p>This article just highlights the strong potential for these problems and more to form in the developing taxi service market some time in the near future and the algorithmic obfuscation used to give these forces the appearance of neutrality and legitimacy.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2013/september/guilty-pleas-show-high-cost-of-price-fixing-in-auto-industry"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2013/september/guilty-pleas-...</a><p>[2]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act</a><p>[3]: <a href=""http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/1/5368098/apple-hit-with-840-million-damages-claim-in-ebooks-lawsuit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/1/5368098/apple-hit-with-840-...</a><p>[4]: <a href=""http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-office-price-fixing,7533.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tomshardware.com/news/microsoft-office-price-fixi...</a><p>[5]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing_cases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_fixing_cases</a>",1397242490

I can&#x27;t see this &quot;simple&quot; solution.<p>Testing is utterly hard. It means that you need creativity, something that many lack or are to lazy to. Many programmers are to lazy to think about testing, I fear. That is the reason, there exist some very limited number of really good software testers in the world.<p>When you want to find that bug in testing (taken, you even have the super-malloc), you first have to come up with the idea, to send a falsified message length for exactly this message type. Without this idea, even the super-hero-malloc would have no chance at all to give any indication of a bug.<p>AND when you have such an idea, you would find the bug, even without any super-hero-malloc ... any malloc or any freelist would suffice, because the result would show you, that something bad is going on.<p>So the focus on the self-written allocator seems to get a little biased in this discussion.<p>Yes, when writing security relevant libraries, you should be really, really careful and you should take any chance you get to make it more save. And it might have in some cases increased the chance of finding the bug <i>in production</i>, when just using the standard malloc (with security mitigation active) -- but I really doubt, that it would have increased the chance in testing.<p>I also must say, that really many successful software products use their own specialized allocators -- the reason is simple: Because malloc is so unspecific, it is not the fastest beast around -- and many specialized allocators have their own security mitigation build in.<p>A last point: Google also wants (or wanted) to switch to OpenSSL. The reason: Speed. So to blame the OpenSSL guys that they want to make their library really fast, has a little bad taste. Everybody wants speed -- even those that claim other <i>after</i> something has happened. My thought for you: What would be the benefit, if OpenSSL would fail because of bad speed, nobody would use it but an other product -- and exactly that product would have the trouble we found now in OpenSSL (or worse?)  .....<p>Computer Industry can sometimes be unforgiving.

The fact that they&#x27;ve circumvented the regulations is because the regulations don&#x27;t necessarily make sense:  They don&#x27;t &quot;cruise&quot; like taxis do, so they cause less traffic congestion.  They don&#x27;t use taximeters, so you don&#x27;t have a device which needs to be calibrated and checked by the state.  In the case of UberX, they own their own cars, so they&#x27;re less likely to be reckless drivers.  They don&#x27;t require queues like taxis do outside of bars, or even worse, at the airport, where a queue attendant has to be paid to make sure passengers don&#x27;t accidentally jump the queue.  By having a rating system, there is less of a need for enforcement of a &#x27;taxicab bill of rights&#x27; which shifts costs of monitoring and handling misbehaving cabbies onto the state, etc.",1397241046

With IndexedDB one has to reinvent the wheel to just get basic query features.<p>WebSQL is not deprecation, the W3C Working Group Note actually says:<p><pre><code>  &#x27;This specification is no longer in active maintenance \n  and the Web Applications Working Group does not intend to \n  maintain it further&#x27;.\n</code></pre>\nWebSQL is only available in Webkit based Browsers (Safari, Chrome) which means most mobile browsers.<p>As SQLite is in public domain, no company would &quot;loose their face&quot; if they choose to use it. They could fork off SQLite and change the SQL query syntax (parser) to whatever the W3C finds suitable. <a href=""https://www.sqlite.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sqlite.org</a><p>Mozilla Firefox and FirefoxOS both already ship SQLite for years and can be accessed by its internal JavaScript API. And several Microsoft products already use it anyway (e.g. Forza Xbox games). Microsoft has of course also various other SQL database libraries like MS Access JetRed (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine</a> ), MS Outlook JetBlue (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensible_Storage_Engine</a> ) and MS SQL Server Express (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_Server_Express</a> ) the SQL backend originally forked off for WinFS for Longhorn (Vista beta). It would be trivial for Microsoft to choose one of its many SQL engines and add it to IE 12. The same goes for Mozilla (just expose the API of SQLite).<p>For some reason Oracle and Mozilla pushed IndexedDB. Oracle has conflicting interests, as it owns OracleDB(SQL), MySQL (SQL) and BerkeleyDB (NoSQL and now also SQL support, based on SQLite). Oracle is an official &quot;sponsor&quot; of SQLite development and even ships it as part of it&#x27;s BerkeleyDB package: <a href=""http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/berkeleydb/overview/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technolo...</a> and <a href=""https://www.sqlite.org/index.html#consortium_members"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sqlite.org/index.html#consortium_members</a><p>Mozilla tried to explain why they prefer IndexedDB over WebSQL: <a href=""http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-and-the-road-to-indexeddb/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/06/beyond-html5-database-apis-...</a> and by an Mozilla dev <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20130723044210/http://blog.vlad1.com/2009/04/06/html5-web-storage-and-sql"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20130723044210/http://blog.vlad1...</a> (I generally like Firefox and FirefoxOS but not implementing WebSQL is one of the worst actions that of Mozilla org, IMHO).<p>One can speculate that a less powerful HTML5 API translates in the long run to more SQL server licenses for Oracle and Microsoft. If the web app devs cannot do the processing & storage on the client side, one has to do it on the server side.<p>Anyway, I hope that we get an SQL API for HTML 5.x that also Mozilla and/or Microsoft implements. As of now WebSQL works fine in Webkit based browser which includes Safari, Chrome, Opera and includes also 95% of all smart phones.",1397240482

If you&#x27;re trying to write an IPOS interface that abstracts all that pain away for the client that&#x27;s interacting w/ the system, it can lead to weird situations. Some POS systems will let you open a check w/ nothing on it (Aloha) but some won&#x27;t (Micros).

There are a ton of edge cases that you have to test, and the way two POS systems work in similar conditions are never the same.<p>Getting menu data out of a POS is a nightmare, as there&#x27;s usually a ton of unused junk that you don&#x27;t need. Often there are many duplicates, so the Onion topping you add to a taco is different from the Onion topping you add to nachos, and both are different from the Onion topping you&#x27;d put on a burrito.

Sometimes, menu items that are on sale for happy hour or something aren&#x27;t different items, but they get modified with &quot;happy hour&quot;. You don&#x27;t want your users seeing that junk, so you have to do a bunch of magic behind the scenes to submit the normal item AND the happy hour mod when the user orders it.<p>I could go on, there&#x27;s a LOT of this weirdness when working with POS systems and most of the time you don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;ll be until you&#x27;ve sat there banging your head against your desk because when you order a Sandwich + fries it works, but a Sandwich + garlic fries will only add the fries to the cart. Feels good when you&#x27;re finally done with the integration, but it&#x27;s hell getting there.<p>Oh, and a lot of the time there is no real API, you&#x27;re changing database files or doing some sort of dark voodoo magic to get the thing to work.

7574449,comment,7573906,7573906,7,0,dmunoz,,,"> What’s more, there are recent developments in quantum gravity that seem to support the opposite conclusion: that is, they hint that a standard quantum computer could efficiently simulate even quantum-gravitational processes, like the formation and evaporation of black holes. Most notably, the AdS/CFT correspondence, which emerged from string theory, posits a “duality” between two extremely different-looking kinds of theories. On one side of the duality is AdS (Anti de Sitter): a theory of quantum gravity for a hypothetical universe that has a negative cosmological constant, effectively causing the whole universe to be surrounded by a reflecting boundary. On the other side is a CFT (Conformal Field Theory): an “ordinary” quantum field theory, without gravity, that lives only on the boundary of the AdS space. The AdS/CFT correspondence, for which there’s now overwhelming evidence (though not yet a proof), says that any question about what happens in the AdS space can be translated into an “equivalent” question about the CFT, and vice versa.<p>If you would like to read more about this, the author of this article has another blog post [0] that discusses the Susskind paper &quot;Computational Complexity and Black Hole Horizons&quot; [1] in its first half.<p>They key point, for those who don&#x27;t have time to read the post:<p>> On one side of the ring is AdS (Anti de Sitter), a quantum-gravitational theory in D spacetime dimensions—one where black holes can form and evaporate, etc., but on the other hand, the entire universe is surrounded by a reflecting boundary a finite distance away, to help keep everything nice and unitary.  On the other side is CFT (Conformal Field Theory): an “ordinary” quantum field theory, with no gravity, that lives only on the (D-1)-dimensional “boundary” of the AdS space, and not in its interior “bulk.”  The claim of AdS/CFT is that despite how different they look, these two theories are “equivalent,” in the sense that any calculation in one theory can be transformed to a calculation in the other theory that yields the same answer.  Moreover, we get mileage this way, since a calculation that’s hard on the AdS side is often easy on the CFT side and vice versa.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1697"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=1697</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5674"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5674</a>",1397239613

Relational databases exist in a sweet spot of efficiency, widespread availability, and fairly decent ability to represent directed graphs.<p>But you need to know the shape of your graph first. The document-store model tends towards giving up the graph entirely and just going with a tree. Us programmers love tree structures. They make things nice and tidy and can be traversed in finite time.<p>But I&#x27;ve never worked on a project that could easily be modeled as a tree. Unfortunately, this was often realized after I had been working on the project for a year. You know how phenomenally fucked you are having a tree-like data structure when what you really need is a directed graph? You&#x27;re basically all the fuckeds.<p>Directed graphs generalize trees, so trying to shoehorn a tree where a directed graph is needed is basically bringing a Fischer Price tool set with you to Habitat for Humanity.<p>Thus, from experience, I never start with a tree now. I always start with a directed graph. If I learn that the data is a tree after a year and not actually a directed graph, oh well, look at all this flexibility we didn&#x27;t need.",1397239241

Simplistic networks are good for learning certain things in isolation but some phenomena might only be the result of complex systems and studying small networks may never lead us towards understanding these complex phenomena. The obvious one is &quot;consciousness&quot; but even things like sensory perception which in part is the result of complex, distributed calculations would difficult if not impossible to understand from studying simple networks.",1409803108

For example, having a userStatus.getUserCall() is a step in the right direction. Now have the service check the response code and use the user data to create a single user object that can be returned/resolved. So your controller becomes userStatus.getUserCall().then(function(user) { $scope.user = user; }) or since angular templates are promise aware, you can reduce it to $scope.user = userStatus.getUserCall().

Banks can raise funds cheaply through deposits (and many other sources like wholesale funding which may be at a higher cost), which they lend out at slightly higher interest rates than they pay their depositors. Given that LC is not a depository institution, the only way I see them providing lower interest rates is they have figured out a cheaper source of funding - or burning investor money to do this which is not sustainable and the big banks will defeat them eventually. The moment you start taking deposits, you will be regulated like any other institution and they need to compete with other banks on the same terms. Another aspect is that banks are in the business of risk management, so it is probable that LC has figured out a better way to manage their risks than existing institutions - again, this is something where existing institutions have enough resources to catch up easily.",1409801866

And if a lot of loans go bad, that will hurt the investors in those notes, but Lending Club as an entity won&#x27;t be insolvent or even have any losses at all.<p>This is true, but one should recognize that for Lending Club to sustain itself over time, it must be able to acquire borrowers and sell notes. There are a number of events that could put a dent in both supply and demand.<p>On the demand side, if and when there is a recession, defaults will almost certainly rise and it&#x27;s likely fewer investors (retail and institutional) will be eager to take on new credit risk. If and when interest rates rise, funding these loans may become a lot less appealing. One must also assume that at least some borrowers, particularly those who are heavily indebted, are themselves vulnerable to interest rate increases, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see rising rates negatively affect the repayment performance of certain types of portfolios.<p>> There&#x27;s another point that&#x27;s a flip side of this one, which is: Equity-funded banks are great at lending.

Martinis is very good, and I already thought it was interesting when I saw earlier today that Google had picked him up. That he will be trying to improve D-Wave style designs (by dropping in transmons, from the sound of this article) is not at all what I would have guessed.<p>I think that will be fairly tough. It&#x27;s been a while since I looked at D-Wave, but aside from the whole &quot;is it quantum&quot; question about their stuff, their fabrication always seemed like a real strength. They had tons of on-chip circuits for addressing all of the qubits, and building devices with that many Josephson junctions that work is not easy. The comment that some of their material choices are probably limiting coherence is almost certainly true (this was one of Martinis&#x27;s big contributions from ~10 years ago). But translating processes of that complexity to cleaner setups seems like it&#x27;s going to require some real fabrication fu. I certainly wouldn&#x27;t put it past Martinis, but it&#x27;s ambitious for sure.",1409799789

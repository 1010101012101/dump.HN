You simply forget about the Javascript and just write Java.<p>The big benefit of using GWT over writing 'native' javascript is that you get the same behaviour on all browsers.<p>The big benefit of using GWT over using other java based web frameworks is that GWT moves the client's state down to the client, where it belongs.<p>If you look at most other Java web frameworks like that (e.g. Struts and it's direct competitors), they expend enormous effort porting data to and from the client, and trying to hack around the limitations of the HTML post operation - namely that blank values aren't returned (checkboxes!!) and that everything is passed as text (numbers!!).  So what these other frameworks do is they end up making you write all these model objects, and then try to simulate the client state.  JSF is the worst of these as it takes it the furthest, they're not just emulating the model, but also the  view as well with their overly-complex de-hydration and re-hydration of components.<p>If you tell the client state to bugger off back to the client where it belongs, you save a good 30-40% of your typical web framework effort right there.<p>Eliminating Javascript browser/version idiosyncrasies saves you another 20-30% of your effort (more if the UI is very dynamic, less if it isn't).<p>-----<p>I think you're posting on the basis of assumptions you've made based on what you've heard about GWT, rather than experience with it.",1309164535

If suburbia is a bubble, it'll come down crashing eventually.<p>If there's something to change with regard to the suburbs is that we should distribute the costs of living in a suburbs vs cities fairly. That is suburbanites should be paying much larger portion of the costs of public infrastructure and roads that stretch dozens of miles out to the countryside and are of no use except for suburbanites themselves.<p>However, there's a much more serious problem related to the effects of suburbia.<p>The fundamentals of current city planning and urban design, largely borrowed from the Garden City utopia, for the suburbia are so detached from the reality of urban development in cities that the greatest danger is in blindly applying these incompatible principles to the urban environment and, in effect of doing so, crippling the <i>real fundamentals</i> that actually govern a vibrant city life. We are killing the whatever health our cities might still possess by making them more fit for automobiles, segregating different uses into different zones, and doing huge disruptive redevelopment projects that wipe out and reset to zero big parts of city neighbourhoods.<p>The result from this is be the devastation of cities by applying governance and design principles incompatible with city development--which has already been going on for decades--which effectively leaves people only the suburbia.<p>Such a monotonous development is bad for the survival in general as is anything that lacks diversity. Think of Windows viruses versus virii for other platforms. Such a big disruption that could wipe out suburbia for anybody but the richest of the people is the rising of the price of oil.

But, I've never been that type of person. I landed the job I have now by rejecting that belief entirely, and I'm in a position to achieve more success than those same people who hounded me to embrace it and I'm only 19. That being said, it obviously informs me in the business realm. I guess I'd see myself as a hypocrite if on one hand I have this belief that you should do what you love to do and not be forced into a job you hate because you have to make ends meet, or because it is what is expected of you, while on the other hand, I'm forcing the people I hire to do exactly what I reject.<p>I admit that I may have an immature view on things. I don't know everything, nor do I have any intent to come off as knowing everything. Hence, this thread! I've only been doing this for a couple months, but the nature of the industry I work in requires that I adapt quickly and assume roles that requires more experience than I have currently. To make up for that, I am reaching out to those who know more so they can help inform my ultimate decisions.<p>I am leaning towards being 100% business-minded, and suppressing my feelings of hypocrisy, because in the end what will matter is that I got the job done and put the infrastructure in place that catapulted the business into greater profitability. Not whether I preserved my life philosophies. Nonetheless, I think a good discussion could arise out of the whole preserve philosophical pureness for the sake of money, or not dilemma.<p>Anyways, going forward I will for sure write out a report for the partner. It may take me a bit to put together, as I will need to brief him on the history of what exactly we're doing, but I think I can sway him to see my side.<p>And, I never thought about hiring a dev to create a script to alter the designs programatically. I will definitely look into that.

Once securitization made it easy to take a cut up front but sell them off onto someone else's books before they blew up, brokers and banks (including mortgage banks unaffected by the CRA) were <i>eager</i> to push through as many bad deals as they possibly could, with basically any buyer who could fog a mirror. Wall St. was so desperate for stuff to bet on that when the supply of borrowers ran low, they resorted to making new side bets on the outcomes of old loans (through synthetic CDOs made up of credit default swaps).<p>Blame the credit rating cartel for declaring large tranches of the whole mess to be ""AAA investment grade"" and thus marketable to huge institutions that had no business being involved, because they didn't think homebuyer defaults would be strongly correlated due to underlying forces.",1309162943

I use a strong passphrase and two-factor authentication for a reason, and this defeats it. I already disable the ""secret questions"", since I don't want cracking the account to be much easier than cracking the passphrase.<p>I would like Google to give me an option to disable the ""last chance form"" for my account. Or, if they inisist, I'd like the ""last chance"" to be to fly to Mountain View and show Google my passport or a court order.<p>EDIT: and for extra bogusness, it seems that the information needed for the ""last chance form"" can't be changed if it's compromised.

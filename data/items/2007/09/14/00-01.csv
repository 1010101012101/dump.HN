Check out the area around 2nd to 4th Avenue, and B Street to El Camino.  Got a movie theater, a Japanese Tea Garden and Central Park that hosts Free Concerts and Outdoor Shakespeare events, Caltrain station, and Ramen shops galore.  Not to mention there are/were a bunch of techs that made it big time here.  Youtube and Napster to name a few.<p><a href=""http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=E+3rd+Ave+and+B+Street,+San+Mateo,+California+94401,+United+States&sll=37.566708,-122.322958&sspn=0.017553,0.027852&ie=UTF8&ll=37.566113,-122.322421&spn=0.017553,0.027852&z=15&iwloc=addr&om=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q...</a>",1189730205

This is some of the best information I've gotten yet.  <p>We've seen a bunch of places in Palo Alto and Mountain View that we could see ourselves living in.  We've walked around Castro and University Ave's to get a feel for those city centers. <p>Thanks particularly descriptions of those other areas I've haven't heard about but now see popping up in the craigslist ings.

54448,comment,54034,54034,0,0,majimojo,,,"Used to work in Sunnyvale and I have friends who live in San Jose and Mountain View.  Have lived in SF, Foster City, Burlingame, and San Mateo now.<p>Sunnyvale got its wide variety of low cost rent places and decent Indian and Cheap and good Asian food places. El Camino Real is basically a mobius loop of America e.g. McDonalds, Starbucks, Ethnic Zone, repeat.  Sister used to live in Mountain View off 85 by the Albertsons.  Personally, if you're gonna live in Mountain View, somewhere close to downtown Castro Street would be cool to get food and beers and that kind of stuff.  A bunch of startups (Meebo?) are around that area too.<p>Foster City is quiet.  They have a bunch of golf courses and a Costco going for it.  San Mateo is just about in the middle of everything, I like it because of the laid back downtown and being 5 min from the airport, 15 min from SV, 20 min (no traffic) from the city.  That being said, San Mateo dies after 9pm.  So if you're one of those party types lookin for a midnight saturnalia, the city is your only hope.\n",1189728378

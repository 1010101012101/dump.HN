1973625,comment,1973291,1973291,0,0,danilocampos,,,"Justin, I couldn't help noticing you're following <i>4,873</i> people.<p>That's... a lot of people. I can't keep up with more than 400 follows, much less four thousand (I follow about 100 these days). My kneejerk reaction here is that you've leveraged Twitter effectively but that it's pretty one-sided. That is – you're getting plenty out of the deal, but since you can't really keep up with the people you follow, your Twitter presence ends up 99% self-promotional.<p>Which is okay, if your goals are strictly promotional.<p>It's worth pointing out, though, that you can derive a lot of value from Twitter by following <i>only those people who say things that are interesting to you</i>. That's the route I choose. As a result, my steam is filled with chatter about subjects I enjoy, people I like, articles that will interest me. I have conversations with people whose tweets catch my attention. I can count on it to serve as useful data pipe, which in the end, I value more than self-promotion. Of course, YMMV.<p>Hybrid approach for Twitter outsiders: Do Justin's thing for awhile, then after you hit your follower goal, start unfollowing every single person whose contributions don't improve your stream. If they're interesting but not useful on a regular basis, add them to lists. Keep culling your follows until you get under 200, then enjoy your new, always-on chatroom filled with cool people who say useful things.",1291603947

It's much better than leaving work to go to fedex, ups, what have you.<p>Most large companies already have shipping departments, so the only additional fixed cost is the ability to take money from employees.<p>And, if fed ex/ups/etc have minimums, this helps meet them, so it may even reduce some company costs.",1291603936

I think that open access journals are net cheaper than their print counterparts, but it will always cost money to produce a good journal.  Look at the PLoS group.  They are the closest we have to a top-tier online-only journal and they produce a high quality journal with an excellent impact score.  However, it still costs $2900 to get an article published (if it's accepted) in PLoS Biology.  Why?  Because that's their costs.<p>You are also severely over estimating the ability of most academics to produce a good, publication ready, PDF.  If you're publishing in a journal, there is a set look and feel that must be applied.  No matter how good the work is, someone still has to apply the right layouts.  I've published in a conference before where what you submit is a camera-ready document, but somehow no one seems to set things up the same way.  And good luck getting a biologist to figure out LaTex... that isn't going to happen.<p>What you're describing seems to be closer to a distributed combination of arXiv and PLoS One, which is where I think we'll end up moving in the future.  However, for now, the hosting costs of the organization is not trivial.  Even arXiv has started seeking external funding for support.<p>I'm scared to think of the state of science if open journals are going to do to existing journals what craigslist did to newspapers.  Now newspapers are struggling to figure out a way to pay for high-quality reporting in a world without a sustainable revenue model.  The result is poorer quality news or news dominated by a few big players.<p>In science, the journal system has long served as a filter for information.  Sure, a purely open access environment would let more people publish quicker, but it would also fill up the scientific record with a lot more noise.  And there will always be costs to filtering signal from noise.",1291601602

Tumblr is mostly amazing, extremely valuable, and actually trying to do something interesting + valuable for its users.  (From the outside it's hard to see. But as with Twitter, the inside view of using it reveals all sorts of interactions and relationships that make it awesome + addictive.)<p>Main point? You should use tumblr. It's not just a blog platform. It's a place to discover awesome content, connect with interesting folks, and get your stuff heard really easily.<p>But... those of us who have used tumblr for a while have different conversations amongst ourselves.<p>Aside from performance, Tumblr has been buggy for an extremely long time. Since before its recent spike in popularity and sharp growth.
In fact, I almost get bummed when the topic of performance issues come up because i fear that attention to broken things like Dashboard search, saved tags, group blogs, etc... will get overlooked.<p>Their API is also a bit stagnant, which even if you're not a dev, means less cool stuff you can do w/all the amazing content + people in Tumblr.<p>As kylebragger wrote above, it's surreal how Tumblr does not mention a thing. They don't have a status blog. They don't have a user forum where we can talk about Tumblr best practices. (There is an abandoned Get Satisfaction presence). They don't have a place to suggest features for users, or developers. No Uservoice. No mailing list. They have a blog which is about 80% recommending fun Tumblrs to follow. They also announce apps. They have a couple of times addressed bugginess around a feature, queues, but only after they felt they fixed it.<p>This makes me think they are probably working on some giant code bomb that will fix everything, and don't want talk about stuff until they have good news. I understand that, but don't agree with it. It's literally been years. It's just more acute now than it's been before.<p>Anyway, I don't hate Tumblr, I LOVE tumblr. I recommend it to tons of people. Even if it's down 2 hours every day, i'll still recommend it.<p>But it is not cool how they never talk about stuff. I get that transparency is not the only style of community and product management. (Something something Steve Jobs Apple.)<p>But I think it's a bad fit here.

(Secured debts and bills on active accounts (like current utilities that could get shut off) have to be paid first.)  Then do what you can to whittle away the debt.  Read up on debt collection tactics and law so you can tell who can really hurt you and who is just bluffing.<p>Then just hang on for a long ride.  Eventually you will have deals with all the creditors and hopefully no new surprises will show up. [The possibility of new surprises showing up was a lingering fear for me - one extra unknown ""debt"" showed up almost a year later, but fortunately I was able to convince them that I was no longer guaranteeing the account when the charges were made. Which was true.]<p>As a backup, I had looked into bankruptcy options and positioned myself to protect myself (as much as is possible) while going through it.<p>IMPORTANT: set up an extra bank account at a different bank and use it to pay debts.  You do not want the creditors to know where your money is. When you are negotiating a deal and/or a payment plan and then following it, you do not want them to be able to see if you have more money (even though it is not legal, it is still easy to find out how much money someone has in their bank account.)
If the creditors have already been paid from your current accounts, then open new accounts at a new bank for your personal use and use the old one for debt paying.
Only load the debt paying account with what is needed.<p>[Important - make sure the account does not have ANY overdraft protection - any overdraft should be rejected.  Many creditors will accelerate the payments (and claim you agreed to it) to try to grab more before other creditors get it - this happened to a friend of mine; they agreed to a series of payments and the creditor simply submitted the whole batch each month to see how many would clear.]<p>When negotiating, make your starting ""debt"" for negotiation the actual amount owed.  The creditors will use an inflated amount (including a LOT of interest and penalties) as the starting point so you will have to get 25 to 50% reduction just to get the the original debt amount.",1291601490

The Swedish prosecution obviously have done a terrible job, but ""who did what and when"" is pure gossip.<p>On the other hand this is the one of the biggest technology related stories of the year. Of the Swedish cables only 1% have been released publicly and newspapers have been running ""front page"" stories about the leaks for a week [1]. A majority of which is about the actual content of the leaks and not meta. Swedish national television also ran a program about the content of the leaks earlier tonight. I would imagine it's the same in many other countries. In short: This story is huge.<p>What I don't get is why you have to post so many comments on a subject you don't like or are interested in.

But guess what, I just ignore those stories and read the other ones instead.

The screen is just the right size - I <i>almost</i> feel it is too big but it sits comfortably in the hand.

The scansearch feels like it could be useful when travelling but so far I haven't had any need for it.<p>Oh, and the voice quality is better than any phone I've had before including the BlackBerry Bold and Storm.

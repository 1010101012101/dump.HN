2) It&#x27;s a solid retention strategy.

Cassandra clusters tend to carry higher production loads per machine when powered by Zing (compared to OpenJDK or HotSpot on the same hardware). All while dramatically improving their latency behavior and consistency.<p>Specifically, on similarly sized heaps and workloads, the C4 collector&#x27;s throughout is better than CMS&#x27;s and close to ParallelGC&#x27;s. And since it&#x27;s throughput scales linearly with the amount of empty heap configured and since (unlike OpenJDK/Hotspot) Zing places no practical pause-related caps on how much memory can be applied, it tends to beat both on efficiency in actual configurations.<p>The notion that good latency behavior has to come at the expense of throughput is just a silly myth. There are plenty of examples that disprove it. Zing/C4 is just one of many.",1441140560

It does have a legit discoverability problem, which most folks in UX acknowledge but don&#x27;t know how to fix, given other constraints of the media.<p>Some of the most effective solutions to this I&#x27;ve seen require solutions beyond visual representation. They address the problem through dimensions independent of viewport size and space.<p>For example, LukeW&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Divert the Train&quot; <a href=""http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1798"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1798</a> moves content from behind navigation and into the user&#x27;s already-occurring action stream. The button is removed entirely, as is the designer&#x27;s need to consider how communicative icons are for representing actions.<p>This requires a broader view of how features relate to each other through a design process that discovers other paths to successful behavior. Approaches like the hamburger menu, in addition to the usability issues you note, solve functional goals but have fallen out of vogue for their ineffectiveness at encouraging specific actions. Label-less icons, while attractive and convenient, suffer similar problems.  As getting users successful quickly is generally an important goal (before they&#x27;ve internalized your app&#x27;s unique visual language), the current trend of putting core functionality behind opaque symbols seems counterproductive.",1441140059

I&#x27;m a white guy that spent much of my life in areas that were controlled by Blacks and one controlled by Hispanics. Whites in those areas experienced everything Blacks describe in areas with white racists: job discrimination; government discrimination; different police treatment; being served second or not at all at a food place; unprovoked beatdowns by black mobs (esp in schools); different punishment in schools; banned from certain &quot;hoods&quot; always or certain times. Ran into one or two places controlled by women that discriminated against men for key positions but most women-run places were more fair.<p>Anyway, the point is this stuff is an aspect of human nature and group dynamics. It happens any time a majority is in control of an area or situation with minorities pushing into their turf. We need to eliminate it across the board for all parties. The Navy example was a great one. I also once attended a diversity class that suggested methods of trying to eliminate bias. Another time a HR person suggested Topgrading methodology that was results-focused and said it helped her. Each of these apparently reduced the effect of discrimination in hiring, promotion, and firing.<p>So, I think we should put a bunch of effort into further R&D on such methods. Not to mention, collect a bunch of what&#x27;s proven to work (partly or fully) into one resource. I see lots of interesting, data-driven methods posted on HN. Add them, too. Maybe keep a forum or blog network going where results of experiments can be posted over time to see where success is trending.

10155469,comment,10153802,10153802,0,0,dpc_pw,,,"Once in my careerer I was already tasked with stripping a C project from a Python based building system (SCons, IIRC)  because it was damn slow, buggy, and problems with Python and SCons were more severe than with a C codebase itself. I replaced it with kbuild, and it still works nicely in production even today.<p>I&#x27;m hesitant getting anything Python-related next to my C codebase, and IMO, C-people are generally not very enthusiastic about Python. Once the time comes, that something custom needs to be done in the building system, dealing with Python syntax, completely new abstractions, etc. is just more pain than using established solutions that everyone are familiar with (make, autotools, CMake).<p>Maybe Python 3 ecosystem (things like packaging etc.) does not suck as much as Python 2 (though I&#x27;d bet it still does), and maybe Meson is really great, but on top of my Python-implementation reservations, I also don&#x27;t see much of a point: the billions of C legacy code will not be ported to a new building system, a there should be not that much new projects in raw C anyway, with languages like Go, Rust, D showing clear road ahead, baking their own solutions for common building system issues. Projects like &quot;tup&quot; have much more appeal to my C-developer nature, but then again, I didn&#x27;t have opportunity to employ tup anywhere, as nowadays I write every new project in Rust.<p>Than again, it&#x27;s just my personal opinion, and I guess somewhere, some people could find it really fitting their needs.",1441139676

I have no idea where to look for that option - or if that option exists.  There&#x27;s a burger menu, so I tap that. There&#x27;s a list of options. Satellite is in that list, and is highlighted. The option I want, and I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s called, doesn&#x27;t appear to be in that list of menu items.  I tap the map to collapse the burger menu. I hold the screen then release. A pin is dropped. I don&#x27;t think I want a pin, but I have no idea how I dismiss the pin. When the pin is placed a small thing pops up at the bottom of the window. None of that looks relevant. I, completely accidentally, pull it, and a bit more appears.  None of that is relevant either (but now I&#x27;ve accidentally discovered how to get street view). I pull it again because something happened the first time and yet more stuff appears, but nothing relevant.  I realise that it can&#x27;t be this hard, so I go back to the burger menu and unintuitively click &quot;satellite&quot;. I don&#x27;t want satellite, and this menu item is already highlighted, and it never occurs to me that someone would put a toggleable item in a list of menu entries without any indication that it&#x27;s a toggle. But bamn there it is.<p>So, how would I change Maps?  Just put a few more affordances in there. Maybe watch how people unfamiliar with the app try to do stuff.<p>There are lots of things I like about maps. There&#x27;s some churn in businesses on my street and maps always seems happy to change info.<p>In the past there was a ton of research into user interaction with UI.

Books are no different than media in general: there was an article posted earlier today on HN about how there are simply too many TV shows right now, and at the same time new shows have to compete with every other great TV show that people might not have watched yet.<p>Media has finally evolved to the point where the long tail is starting to become the market. This has interesting implications on consumption patterns, though what we&#x27;re seeing is that the long tail is increasingly served by a single company: YouTube for video (excluding &quot;head&quot; or &quot;neck&quot; content on cable/Netflix/etc), Amazon for books, Steam for games, etc. This points to discovery and market access being a problem: people don&#x27;t look for the long tail elsewhere because the draw of the long tail is selection, and only one store/site can boast the best selection of obscure content.<p>Where does this go? I have no idea, honestly. Media is incredibly interesting right now because of that. I don&#x27;t know if the long tail effect is good or bad for society, but we&#x27;re seeing it play out in a lot of weird ways right now (Trump&#x27;s campaign, the awakening that the police may shoot a lot more innocent people than we realized, etc).

I assume it&#x27;s the use of icons and drawers to trigger functionality rather than labels and links?<p>That&#x27;s driven by screen size - there&#x27;s simply not enough screen real estate on a phone to label every button with words.  It does have a legit discoverability problem, which most folks in UX acknowledge but don&#x27;t know how to fix, given other constraints of the media.  I&#x27;ve seen a bunch of mobile apps with help overlays or tour videos the first time you run them, which can help a lot.  It gets back-ported to desktop apps because once people <i>do</i> learn the functionality, it leads to a cleaner, less cluttered UI.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that early PCs had the same problem.  A typical PC from the early 1980s had 320x200 resolution, a little less than a smartwatch does today.  For most of the 80s and early 90s, the standard was VGA (640x480), slightly smaller than most smartphones today.  Icons were really common back then as well, they weren&#x27;t all that discoverable, but at least people read manuals occasionally.  Most folks don&#x27;t bother now.  Menus were another response to that problem, but they don&#x27;t really work on mobile because the tap target is too small to efficiently hit it (the navigation drawer & hamburger menu is the modern-day equivalent of the menu).<p>The web - with its inherent discoverability and all of its space for explanatory text - didn&#x27;t really become popular until 1280x1024 displays became widespread.  I remember designing webapps for 800x600 screens; it was painful, and they had discoverability problems too.",1441138289

10155296,comment,10141546,10141611,0,0,ericelliott,,,"> Unit tests are usually too low-level to give feedback into the API design. My experience is that functional tests, based on use case scenarios, give much better feedback.<p>I was talking about the API of the unit under test. In JavaScript terms, this typically means the public API of the module being tested. APIs are developer UX, and providing a good developer UX is great for code quality.<p>> Standard TDD-based design doesn&#x27;t really have a way to specify which is part of the &quot;public&quot; API vs. the testing API.<p>You should only test the module&#x27;s public API. If there are functions used internally by that module that also need testing, those bits should be in their own modules with their own unit tests.<p>> Unit tests rarely encode performance requirements.<p>Correct, but mostly because the biggest perf problems don&#x27;t happen at the unit level. They happen at integration levels where things like network communications and disk access happen. Unit tests document the unit&#x27;s requirements, not the app&#x27;s requirements. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s also important to have functional tests, and depending on needs, integration tests as well, but even those usually don&#x27;t measure perf. That&#x27;s where load testing and app profiling come into play.<p>All of that is important, and I&#x27;m not trying to downplay any of that. However, none of those things can replace unit tests, and the benefits of documenting unit functionality in code.<p>> Manual QA is a skill in it own right. This is why you have QA staff<p>Agreed, but it would be extremely inefficient for a developer to ask the QA team for help testing every time they make a change to a unit under development. Automating unit-level QA can solve time by automatically checking the full behavior suite of the unit under test every time the developer saves a file. Studies have shown that far fewer errors make it into the released product when developers use a TDD process, which saves developer time, saves QA time, and improves the user experience, because there are fewer product defects.<p>> You’ll probably get better return on your investment by automating integration tests, bug regression tests, and system tests than by automating unit tests.<p>That&#x27;s one person&#x27;s opinion. The empirical evidence linked to in the article says otherwise.<p>In the article you refer to, James Coplien betrays his misunderstanding about the ideal role and use of unit tests by talking about refactoring already existing functions into smaller, more testable functions. Using the TDD process (test first), you write the assertions before you implement the functions, so no such refactoring is necessary.<p>He also talks about the futility of large code coverage from the perspective of somebody going back over code and adding tests later, which can indeed be quite challenging, but if you&#x27;re following TDD, you don&#x27;t write code paths that do not satisfy a test assertion, which guarantees 100% code coverage.<p>It would be silly to throw out a process that has been tried and proven because of the opinion of somebody who doesn&#x27;t even understand the process to begin with. =)",1441137848

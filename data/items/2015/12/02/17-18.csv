That is a very unsolved problem and a very under funded one.<p>A lot of current extraction techniques use liquid water (not available on an asteroid), all extraction techniques depend on the raw ore being transportable by buckets or belts with gravity keeping things in place (also not available on asteroids). And many refinement techniques are very energy expensive (challenging to ship to an asteroid). So if you can figure out how to solve even one of those problems and asteroid mining company that hires you will be ahead of the game.",1449078606

The original iPhone didn&#x27;t have many options in this regard whereas many others did.  Later, they added more options to customize these things more thoroughly (though never to the extent of homescreen widgets).<p>On the watch side, I don&#x27;t have an Apple Watch but I picked up a Moto 360 for around $150 last year.  Not gonna get into the eternal Apple vs. The Rest debate but one things I&#x27;ve noticed (aside from agreeing with your thoughts on the adequacy of using it as a simple phone extension) is that my other most common activity is changing the face of the watch.<p>It seems like such a simple thing but honestly, if someone offered me a $150-250 watch that simply told me the time and mirrored notifications from my phone, I might not be too enthusiastic.  But if the proposition was just $150-250 for a watch where you could change the face to look any way you want, I think I&#x27;d still be tempted even without much in the way of other &quot;smart&quot; features.<p>There&#x27;s a huge range of watch faces I can download and there are simple tools that allow me to make my own.  I can easily swap from something minimalist to something that looks like a luxury watch to something that looks like a Fallout Pipboy to something that looks like a neon sign with a couple of taps on my phone or watch.<p>It&#x27;s something I didn&#x27;t expect to care much about but the sheer flexibility of a programmable and customizable watch face has made it one of those head-slappingly obvious features I should&#x27;ve seen a mile away.<p>I wonder when/if the Apple Watch will give more options in this regard.  Because no matter how cool the apps are, a watch is still a personal piece of jewelry as well.  When that piece of jewelry is also a computer with a display, there&#x27;s a lot of room for customization and personalization, even if they want to keep the core interface the same for consistency.  A user-defined or even user-created default face for when your watch is just sitting on your arm would be great to have, even if tapping or interacting brought up the standard Apple Watch interface.",1449078602

Yeah, it&#x27;s not exactly difficult to locate a powerful dish, but it&#x27;s also not glaringly obvious so you can usually pay someone to look the other way.

That same power can also be used for anti-nullification, to convict when the jury thinks the defendant should be punished despite the evidence and law saying not guilty. Historically, this too has tended to be used for racist reasons.<p>The typical counter to this from nullification advocates is that the judge or an appeals court can overturn a conviction when a jury uses anti-nullification to convict.<p>The problem with that is simple: the judge or appeals court generally has no way of knowing that it happened. In most cases, the prosecution does present witnesses and evidence and a somewhat plausible case. The judge cannot tell that the conviction was from anti-nullification rather than from the jury believing the prosecution&#x27;s case.<p>An important aspect of a good justice system is that similarly situated defendants are treated equally. Routine nullification instructions would severely undermine that. If we require a unanimous jury of 12 to convict, then it only takes about 5% of the jury pool to believe that a given law should be nullified to result in 50% of juries having a member who will nullify.<p>Nullification should only be a last resort, for use after the normal political process for changing bad laws has failed. It needs checks and balances to prevent its massive misuse--and the only method anyone has been able to come up with is the hack of not telling people about it. The theory is that in the kind of breakdown of the system where it is appropriate the jury will discover it on their own.",1449077720

Details if anyone cares (and if other people who were there show up and want to correct any details I get wrong, go for it, this was ~20 years ago):<p>It was a hardware/software startup, linux on a mips chip, building a low power personal webserver with an admin interface for naive users.  I joined in 1998, I was hired to run the software side of it.  I was not a co-founder, they were up to about 11 people if I remember correctly, but I was told that I&#x27;d be treated as one.  They gave me 3% of the company which seemed high enough that they were serious so I believed them.<p>Things were a mess when I got there, no version control, no nightly builds, no backups, everything was ad hoc.  Fixing this stuff was easy, it&#x27;s software dev 101.<p>So I got the basics sorted and started working on a schedule.  The founders were headed towards a board meeting and wanted to tell the board that the software would be ready in 3 months.  I protested and said that was nuts, we are doing a kernel bring up (Linux on MIPs was barely a thing at that point). They pushed hard for their 3 months deadline.<p>I went and talked to Bill Earl who has done more OS bringups on MIPS than anyone else I knew (and probably anyone else period).  He asked how far we were, how stable was the compiler, did the kernel boot, did we have anything working in userland, etc.  Standard stuff that anyone would ask trying to get a handle on it.<p>He was actually pretty positive, we were fairly far along, userland was mostly working.  He said &quot;well, it&#x27;s possible that you could get there in 3 months&quot;.  I asked &quot;would you bet your kids college fund on it?&quot;  He said &quot;hell no, 3 months is if everything goes perfectly.  One compiler bug will double that time, so would one kernel bug&quot; (obviously he meant a nasty bug, not something trivial, and he&#x27;s right, I&#x27;ve seen 3 month slips because of something that was hard to find, I&#x27;ve seen much longer as well).<p>So I go back to the founders and say 3 months is a pipe dream, it&#x27;s possible but extremely unlikely.  And I asked to be at the board meeting, I was the director of software, there was no software VP, so the buck stopped with me.<p>They said no.  I resigned as soon as I could put together a resignation letter.<p>Plot twist: I should have stayed (if money was the point).  Sun later bought them for $2B in stock in the doc com hey day.  On paper, assuming there had been no dilution (which I&#x27;m sure there was) I would have been worth $60M.  Oh, well, shoulda coulda woulda.",1449077661

The FPGA&#x27;s have LUTS that represent other logic gates in weird ways for flexibility. They also have traditionally, software-programmed macro-cells like DSP&#x27;s and MAC&#x27;s which are logic programmed. And there&#x27;s an interconnect and power-saving tricks on top of that. Different enough that properly synthesizing to FPGA&#x27;s is a different subfield with different techniques and sometimes 5 to 6-digit software to do it well on heterogenous tiles. I got simpler, free ones that can synthesize or optimize logic with primitive gates.<p>&quot;The lower the power and space efficiency of the interconnect, the larger the incentive is to put ASIC-style interconnected gates into little islands in the FPGA fabric - hence the various complex tiles like MACs that you mention.&quot;<p>&quot;At that point there&#x27;s no real advantage to having those complex tiles, because the equivalent configured FPGA circuit is just as efficient, so you might as well take advantage of the flexiblity of a completely uniform fabric.&quot;<p>You seem to be looking at the technical aspect for the simplest and most elegant solution. Bets on that usually fail because what drives these markets is consumer demand and what&#x27;s good for business. Consumer demand wants things faster, cheaper, optimized for their use case, and so on. <i>That</i>, not interconnects or whatever, prompted the creation of complex tiles that could accelerate their workload. SOC, HPC, and cloud server markets have been going in same direction with offload engines for same reason.<p>The other end of the problem are the suppliers. They know that they need to differentiate to sell more chips. So, they create chips with different specs, new types of LUTS, onboard I.P., accelerators, and so on. They, academics, and startups then create tools to try to utilize them effectively. Consumer demand for this sort of things isn&#x27;t going away and neither is the need to differentiate with them. So, this pattern will remain regardless of technical arguments as it always has in every part of computing industry.<p>So, we get to nanoscale memory, nanowires, nano-FPGA&#x27;s... whatever fictional, better tech you want. So, they get created. Now, everyone has super-fast, low-power chips with tons of logic. Parkinson&#x27;s Law and the above pattern kick in: companies need to differentiate, solution providers start using exponentially more resources for their competitiveness, and users want ways to run these cheaper/faster/whatever. So, they start adding I.P., using different types of nano-blocks, getting clever with interconnects, and so on.<p>In other words, you&#x27;ve swapped out the physical components but changed nothing that drove them to complexity in the first place. The drivers will still be there in age of nano-FPGA&#x27;s. So, they&#x27;ll still be complex, consumers appetites will still be insatiable, and EDA runtimes will be higher than ever. This outcome is always the safe bet.",1449077356

But it was well worth it.<p>I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll see a big benefit for a current 10-second run because of fixed cost of startup is some of that. But running tests in parallel may reveal some bad testing practices: leaving data behind or improper mocking that cause tests to fail in parallel. Fixing all that once you get to a massive set of tests is really painful and slow becuase you have to fix them ALL before switching your testing config. So that might be a benefit to turning it on soon and growing your tests already in an parallel environment.",1449077231

10664325,comment,10661997,10663905,0,0,dragonwriter,,,"> I believe the DBMS&#x27;s model shouldn&#x27;t be conflated with the application&#x27;s model. Sometimes the row is an entity in the domain; however consider a normalised data structure, where the entity as the application understands it may span a couple of tables.<p>If the right DB structure spans a couple of tables, then it probably shouldn&#x27;t be one monolithic object in an application model (there might be a &quot;central&quot; object of sorts, with other related objects of which it is composed; that doesn&#x27;t mean the models are <i>identical</i>, or even exactly 1:1, as, e.g., aggregates are sensibly single objects in an OO design, but multiple rows with some common attribute in a relational design for the same domain model, but Active Record generally accommodates that.)<p>> DataMappers also shine when working against a legacy database or one that cannot be changed.<p>I generally prefer Data Mapper as a pattern for a variety of reasons (just not the particular ones that were raised as problems with AR upthread, or, at least, for reasons that seem different to me than how those were phrased) -- even though I find that there is a usually a close correspondence between the natural relational model for a domain and the natural OO model, with divergences in models usually indicating a violation of good design principles on one side or the other (often the SRP on the OO side), I find AR <i>itself</i> is a violation of the SRP principle; the description of the pattern in PofEAA should raise a big red warning flag about this: &quot;Each <i>Active Record</i> is responsible for saving and loading to the database and also for any domain logic that acts on the data&quot; --&quot;saving and loading to the database&quot; can credibly seen as one responsibility (more succinctly, persistence) but that &quot;and also&quot; introduces a completely separate responsibility.<p>I also don&#x27;t like that the simplicity of most AR implementations -- the main benefit they seem to offer for that compromise of the SRP -- tends to rest on making additional compromises, mostly in DB design and use, but sometimes on the OO side. If you avoid those compromises, you end up with something that isn&#x27;t any simpler to set up and maintain than a Data Mapper, and Data Mapper gives you more freedom to evolve the persistence implementation independently (even if the <i>model</i> is still usually closely parallel to the application model), and even use different types of datastores.<p>(On a note that <i>does</i> approach one of the issues raised upthread, its also a fact that real world DBs and OOPLs both often require pragmatic compromises to the natural abstract relational or OO models for a domain to optimally address real problems; while it would be ideal to choose better tools -- or improve the tools -- to avoid these problems, that&#x27;s often not a practical option, and tightly coupling application and relational models means that that compromise you choose on one side gets reflected on the other side, where it may not be necessary, and may be counterproductive.)",1449077205

I used to play console-based roguelikes, and while they were a bit slow to interact with, RLs were a refreshing tactical change from text-based IF.<p>Reading lots of DF stories would suggest that there&#x27;s some sort of internal eventbus-style system by which the characters themselves interpret their surroundings, and if you could hook into that, you could describe the world textually to some extent. You might even add audio cues for certain events to increase the non-visual fidelity of the UI.<p>I see in some of the below comments that there&#x27;s a text-based mode.

Some of the questions are hard to know without knowing details of the libraries - JSON, as you point out, for instance (it&#x27;s also one I got wrong, expecting better throughput).  But since each question lists the actual performance numbers after you answer, you can get a feel for how big the overhead is in trivial pure python.<p>But yeah, some of the questions were poorly chosen.  For example, on my machine, using gcc -O2 as the author specifies, the first program always executes instantly, since gcc optmizes that loop to nothing.  <i>That</i> leads me to believe he may be running a mac (IIRC those come with absurdly out of date gcc versions as a result of the GPLv3 dispute?) or something else fishy is going on.<p>One interesting thing to note is that the memory access latency on his machine is almost an order of magnitude faster than you might expect based on &quot;Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know&quot; (<a href=""https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832</a>) - and that&#x27;s not a coincidence; those 100ns have always been a bit conservative, and the latency number <i>has</i> slightly improved in the past two decades.",1445777773
10446764,comment,10446067,10446067,0,0,epalmer,,,"I&#x27;m a parent of a recent college grad and high school senior. Both of my girls went to a “good” public school in an semi-affluent neighborhood.  They take standardized tests for two weeks each year. Or at least the calendar is blocked from real work those two weeks. And once done the rest of the school year is time wasting.  So lots of wasted time just for the administration and post test taking.  Teachers routinely complain (in private) about teaching to the tests.<p>And yet there are glimmers of hope:<p>Project based learning in school and after school can make a difference. While not exactly the same thing, challenge based learning, is making a difference in a few school districts across the county as well <a href=""https://www.challengebasedlearning.org/pages/welcome"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.challengebasedlearning.org/pages/welcome</a>.  My girls participated in FIRST Robotics <a href=""http://www.usfirst.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usfirst.org/</a> starting with First Lego League (FLL) and advancing through First Tech Challenge (FTC) and then to First Robotics Competition (FRC).  The best part of these programs is that it is so much more than STEM. They learn how to solve real world like problems, do marketing, run the business of the team, work in teams, learn about robot design, programming and more.  As a volunteer in FIRST for now ten (10) plus years, I have witnessed it transform the lives of more than a hundred kids.<p>There are other similar programs like VEX, which I know little about, but support in concept.  <a href=""http://www.vexrobotics.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vexrobotics.com/</a><p>The biggest challenge with these programs is funding and penetrating the underserved schools.  Of course in the underserved school if kids are hungry then not much else matters. The same could be said for kids that can’t get to after school programs for the many reasons that exist like both parents working, the need to take care of siblings and more.<p>In my state (Virginia), state legislators and the head of the department of education are starting to take notice of the impact of FIRST robotics on outcomes and are talking about funding underserved school programs.  Many robotics team has been lobbying at the state and federal level for just this cause including my daughter’s team.  So maybe next year some funding will be allocated.  In my hometown, Richmond, VA. there seems to be enough passion among adults that volunteers can be found to staff more programs for project based learning.<p>We are also starting to see interest and some action for building and staffing makerspaces in schools and libraries.  This is very exciting since small projects are also valuable for learning and more affordable.  We need makerspaces across k12 and into colleges and universities.<p>While none of the above fixes the teach to the test problem, or the socioeconomic gradient issues,  they at least help in some little ways.",1445777733
10446762,comment,10446067,10446200,0,0,jostylr,,,"I have tutored in private schools (rich, not religious) and have heard of how they structure their day. One prominent thing is that of more freedom. They have more time in between classes, more freedom to socialize, and more choice in their life. This is huge.<p>Additionally, they can get tutored as I just mentioned. Related to that are all the test preps and extra-curricular activities that can be supported with money, etc. These additional resources enrich what students can bring to the classroom.<p>It is hard, however, to ascertain whether their outcomes are better because of anything to do with the school. They have more resources, family connections, and connecting to each other who also have other resources.<p>Fundamentally, my belief is that one should focus on grooming intelligence, not knowledge. The question then becomes how does one help a person become more intelligent? Programming them with knowledge does not help; it just creates miserable robots.<p>Instead, allowing them to be free, moving, interacting, socializing, making a mess out of exploring reality, this is what grows the brain, IMO.<p>I work for a Sudbury school and this is what we focus on making happen. Demonstrative anecdote: we had a student who was with us from age 5 to age 12. He never had any formal instruction. He wanted to go to a different school to join their baseball team. It is a highly respected private school in the area. They interviewed him and were impressed and let him in. In his first weeks of school, he did not know about parts of speech or that a dot meant multiplication of numbers. He quickly learned all of that (pretty simple, after all) and got 90&#x27;s on his first tests. Intelligence is hard to acquire and it requires freedom to explore, freedom to move, freedom to socialize. Knowledge is relatively straightforward to acquire when the brain is ready for it.",1445777694

All your difficulty resides in reducing and/or handling state between functions (well, and any other shortcomings in the actual implementation of the service); again, a software problem.<p>Basically, Amazon, at least (what I have the most experience with) seems to be looking to remove the need for devops by creating standard workflows and mechanisms to bind services together with arbitrary code, and to be able to inherently scale out. The remaining devops burden is sufficiently small, and so tightly integrated with the nature of the software involved, that it&#x27;s oftentimes more effective to just have the devs handle it. While sufficient amounts of code might turn that into a devops role, what I meant by scaling out is a particular app handling a given amount of load. In a classical datacenter environment, moving from an app on one box to an app that spans many is something both the software devs and devops have to concern themselves with, but in the cloud it&#x27;s mostly just a dev consideration; if the app is written to handle multiple copies of itself, spinning up those extra copies should be close to if not actually trivial. That was all that I was saying; the move from one to many doesn&#x27;t require devops any longer, as &quot;how do I make sure all of these boxes are set up properly, get deployed onto, are kept in sync, load is shared between them, etc&quot; are problems that cloud providers have provided tools to solve, and what they leave out doesn&#x27;t require dedicated devops to address.",1445777261

For non-streaming/caching the results, I&#x27;m not sure how primesieve does, but my own primal[0] (which is heavily inspired by primesieve) can find the primes below 5 billion and store everything in memory in 1 second using ~170 MiB of RAM on my laptop (and it doesn&#x27;t support any parallelism, at the moment), and the primes below 500 million in ~0.75 seconds on a Nexus 5, and ~1 second on a Nexus S (although both devices give very inconsistent timings).<p>[0]: <a href=""https://github.com/huonw/primal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/huonw/primal</a>",1445775252

To all intents and purposes, egg is an entirely utilitarian ingredient in mayonnaise, as an emulsifier for the oil and water. In the past, this would be our only emulsifier readily available for such a dish, and now we have many more alternatives. This product (supposedly, I don&#x27;t live in the US so have never tried it) tastes and feels exactly like a good mayonnaise, and shares the two largest parts of the ingredients, why shouldn&#x27;t it be referred to as a mayonnaise?<p>I think the American &quot;cheese&quot; thing is a bit of red herring too. What people are actually referring to is the fact that it&#x27;s actually a cheap, heavily processed product that doesn&#x27;t really bare any resemblance to cheese as we have known it before. This complaint about American cheeses is not usually dished out to, say, Treeline&#x27;s nut cheese brand — presumably because it looks like &quot;real cheese&quot;.<p>It seems incredibly arbitrary to just pick one ingredient and say &quot;hey, this is what makes this a real version of [x]&quot;, especially when that ingredient is apparently so unimportant to the actual consistency and flavour of the product. It&#x27;s as if we&#x27;d arbitrarily decided that something would stop being mayo if the type of oil wasn&#x27;t canola or something.",1445775097

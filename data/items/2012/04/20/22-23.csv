3870168,comment,3869276,3870108,2,0,skore,,,"Agreed - the big difference to the nerdier bits of minecraft here is that it seems, in comparison, absolutely trivial to copy complex concepts in 0x10c.<p>In minecraft, you might be able to load the map for yourself or, if you're already very knowledgeable, copy parts of it into your own map. But building your own x-bit-CPU in minecraft is a herculean task where even the block-by-block copying takes a lot of skill, while in 0x10c, you basically only need to know Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.<p>I guess the biggest change will be when Notch introduces interface to those DCPU-16's. Because that's when you have to start adapting code <i>to your own situation in the galaxy</i>. Still, however, that will provide for a reasonably soft learning curve.<p>What will drive adoption and innovation is the competition of ""I can do X"" and ""I want to do X"" in the marketplace of ideas. It's very solid in minecraft, but if Notch sets the right incentives in 0x10c, I could see this getting a surprisingly broad userbase as well.",1334962771

I guess a good analogy is the impact faster CPU's/more memory has had on programming---when they stop being the limiting factor, we start using languages adapted to us, rather than them.  Similarly, as memorization has become ""cheaper"" to me, I find myself making choices that involve more memorization.  A few days ago I made a deck specifically for all the gmail keyboard shortcuts.

3870125,comment,3869918,3870070,13,0,jessriedel,,,">In the US, the police can take anything they want from you without compensation.<p>I think you are mostly wrong here, and WALoeIII 2 is mostly right, but I wanted to add some detail.<p>Certainly, if the police destroy your property inadvertently while pursuing a criminal, they are under no obligation to compensate you.  It's considered tantamount to the criminal having destroyed it (and so you might be able to seek redress from <i>him</i>).  But, it looks like if the police commandeer your property, they <i>do</i> in fact have a responsibility to compensate you, a la eminent domain.  The Straight Dope article has good details.  Choice quote:<p>> In United States v. Russell the Supreme Court was faced with a claim for three steamers commandeered by military authorities during the Civil War. The Russell court found it obvious that ""the taking of such property under such circumstances creates an obligation on the part of the government to reimburse the owner to the full value of the service."" The court continued, ""private rights, under such extreme and imperious circumstances, must give way for the time to the public good, but the government must make full restitution for the sacrifice."" The court concluded that the obligation to make full restitution was based on an implied promise ""on the part of the United States to reimburse the owner for the use of the steamboats and for his own services and expenses, and for the services of the crews during the period the steamboats were employed in transporting government freight pursuant to those orders.""<p>That said, things aren't always so clear:<p>>The Supreme Court hasn't said what happens if equipment is borrowed and returned damaged, but lower courts have been reluctant to award compensation in such cases. In Blackman v. City of Cincinnati, for instance, the Ohio Supreme Court refused to compensate a vehicle owner for a crash that occurred when police ordered him to chase a fleeing suspect. Other courts have followed suit.<p><a href=""http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2247/can-cops-really-commandeer-cars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2247/can-cops-reall...</a>",1334961739

3870020,comment,3869302,3869966,6,0,jsyedidia,,,"My previous comment was an attempt at humor, but actually, the notion of ""smartest person"" is too ill-defined to be very useful. People are smart at different things. For example, one person might be smarter at playing chess than another, while the second might be smarter at writing computer programs.<p>So let's replace the notion of ""smartest person"" with something better defined, like ""most successful at playing chess, as measured by their chess rating."" In that case, we know who the best in the world is, it's Magnus Carlsen. It would indeed be a waste of time for him to seek chess matches where there was somebody better than him, but it is in fact good advice for everybody else to seek to play against better opponents.<p>However, the strongest players all find that inevitably, they are nearly always stronger than their opponents. For example, the #2 in the world, Levon Aronian, is stronger unless he plays Carlsen. Every grandmaster finds that the large majority of his games are against weaker opponents.<p>So if you're really ""smart,"" it's good advice to try to surround yourself with ""smarter"" people, but don't beat yourself up if you find it hard to do--it's an inevitable consequence of mathematics that the ""smartest"" people will tend to surround themselves with less ""smart"" people, at least if you're only measuring ""smartness"" in one way.",1334959864

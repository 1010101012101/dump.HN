That is what Facebook offers to any company that wants, and that is why 2/3rds of websites now have a Like and Facebook Connect button on them, it is very easy for any service to attempt the social route by tapping into the thing that only Facebook so far has, the social network.<p>Google cant engineer a social network using code, a social network requires specific steps to be carried out in perfect order, it cant  be done overnight, you need to build smaller networks and connect them to larger networks as time progresses. It takes a long time, years even.<p>Reddit is social, hackernews is social. None of them have what Facebook has, real world information about living people and their relationships. Here on HN I could have 5 or 6 accounts and no-one would notice, HN, reddit and any other ""social"" product does not have relationships between humans. Google mail is close to a social network, except the fact that email is mostly used for business and so is most suited for something like LinkedIn, I personally have more companies mailing me than my friends. If I tomorrow made a new google mail account and began using it instead of my old one, would google be able to tell? Facebook for sure would.",1309647487

Traffic has been growing well since we launched and we install 1,000,000 apps every week now.<p>The real problem is that there's not really a term for what we do. The key part in all these stories is that even searching for us is hard. We're doing something totally new so we might as well call it something totally new.<p>I'm also just aesthetically opposed to descriptive names.<p>The other part of this is that we made the product so lightweight that it goes away after you use it. This is one of the reasons people love it, but it does hurt retention.<p>I think we got this choice right though. It's way more important for people to love your product than awkwardly hook them somehow.

With that said you did not have a exim failure, you had a dns failure that broke the delivery of mail because exim could not map host names to ip addresses.<p>The best way to fix that is with a monitoring setup to check that dns is working.  use something like monit or nagios(much heavier) to do a local dns look up on the server box every so often, once every 5 minutes, and get an alert form a different box that does the checking.  Another way is to setup a cron job that send you email and filter to a folder put a time stamp in the subject and look at it every so often to see new stuff is there, run job once an hour and filter into a folder",1309647035

It's always been a goal of mine to work in technology but my career is taking me in the opposite direction.  After teaching myself HTML and CSS, I've started learning Rails so I can begin contributing code.  The problem is that with my job, progress is slower than I'd like it to be and it will probably be a few months before I achieve basic competency and can do anything useful.<p>I'm 25 and have a fair amount of cash saved up, no debt, mortgage, or family I'm beholden to.  My idea is to take a load of cash, move to Thailand, and live very cheaply as I teach myself to code.  Hopefully, after a year, I can come out the other side armed with the knowledge to build whatever I want whenever I want.  It'd also be one hell of an adventure; I just got back from a trip to Beijing a few weeks ago and loved it so I'm at least a little familiar with how things work in Asia.<p>Has anybody in the HN community done anything like this?

I found this old Ask HN (http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=240713), but the responses were less than helpful.<p>I was recently bitten by a supposedly-simple Exim configuration that hasn't been changed in years.  My VPS host recently made some datacenter changes, but failed to mention the requirement to change the name servers in /etc/resolv.conf.  Since Exim couldn't deliver mail in the face of total DNS failure, and the web server continued to function, I didn't find out about the problem for quite a while.  Exim was intended to be using an external SMTP server strictly as a relay for external mail, but instead was sending <i>all</i> mail, including local mail to root and postmaster, through the external server.<p>The result?  Messages from my sites' contact forms (and the resulting delivery failure messages) were discarded rather than winding up in /var/spool/mail/.  How did I find out?  Google Analytics was showing hits to my contact forms, but I wasn't getting any e-mail.<p>I've fixed the DNS problem for now, but I don't want to keep using this fail-deadly setup.  All I need is something that will forward mail from PHP and Ruby scripts to an external SMTP server, and deliver mail for local users into /var/spool/mail/ or similar.  I don't need to receive SMTP, I don't need any custom routing, etc.  I don't want to have to manage a full-blown e-mail server.  Is there nothing simpler than Postfix, Exim, and Qmail?",1309646271

2722543,comment,2722476,2722476,2,0,tirrellp,,,"A question that I would pose to you is 'Do you already have an internal PR campaign started'?<p>In other words, how are you keeping your 'targets' up to date with company progress and milestones?  By targets I mean prospective investors, board members, and advisors.<p>Getting into the groove of keeping these people up to date is good practice for understanding what might be relevant from the perspective of an investor.  It also puts you on their radar so that when you do get that big TC coverage, that could be the thing that compels them to say 'I'm in'.<p>On the other hand, skipping the internal pr and going straight for big coverage leads investors to say something like 'You're on my radar now... lets talk' and at that point you are going to have to keep them up to date with your progress anyway as part of the 'dance' that leads to funding.<p>So my opinion is to start an internal PR campaign keeping prospective stakeholders up to date with progress and milestones and keeping them warm and socialized, then when you get the TC/VB press, it serves to pump up the social proof aspect of how cool your company is.<p>Then your prospective angels can say 'Oh yea, I've been watching those guys since before the TC spread came out, I knew they were something'.  People like to be ahead of the curve.<p>Hopefully this helps, or hopefully this gives you more questions than answers.  Either way, I would like to see this thread not get buried.",1309644549

They entered a market where there was already market saturation and everyone thought they were going to be crushed ""who needs another search engine"". Everyone got complacent and as a result google managed to grow and make a better product. Eventually they move into other areas which then allowed them to dominate the web.<p>Coming from those roots you know full well that its better to crush/compete or acquire companies that can do to you what you did to others many years ago, its safer then thinking your to big for anyone to catchup and become complacent (and far cheaper if you nip it in the bud).<p>If i was the CEO at google i could name a few companies that would make it hard for me to sleep at night and facebook is high on that list. Look at the trend, buzz - (because they couldn't acquire twitter), originally orkut ( friendster fell through and to atleast have some form of social networking product), google offers (either cause groupon's model wasnt to their liking or groupon reject the offer. Irrespective of this groupon still perceived as a threat) along with countless other startups that made cool things that could have potentially competed with googles flagship products.<p>I think its simply cause google knows the web game well, they know that any of these startups (and other hot web properties) can bring them down if they are not careful and its better to acquire or if not keep building competing products so they still stay the dominate power.<p>Now trying to compete with a product such as google+ that could in time be comparable to the currently dominating player is I guess just good for future business :)",1309644466

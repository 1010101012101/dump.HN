3539608,comment,3538585,3539469,5,0,parasubvert,,,"The reality is that both are true - there was an ""HTTP Object Model"" that TBL and Roy Fielding had in mind in the 90s, but it was never formalized until Roy's thesis.   Not everyone on the various IETF and W3C committees understood or agreed with it, clearly, and there are a lot of hacks in practice.  There were attempts like HTTP-NG to supplant HTTP with CORBA-like Object RPC, but the arguments against this were basically informal arguments in favour of the uniform interface of URI + HTTP + MIME.   Even today, the current HTML5 leads don't particularly seem to have much appreciation for the style.<p>That said, starting with the Apache web server, Roy had a lot of control with its architecture and approach to supporting particular HTTP features, using his mental model of the ""Web's architectural style"" to guide it.  After 2000 and the thesis, there are many people that started implementing their clients and servers with the style as a philosophical guide.<p>The style also tends to be widely misunderstood and buzzword-ified, which is scammy.",1328126294

Logging sensitive info is an issue.  Not requesting info that could be logged if you were using default settings.  You will get dinged for logging sensitive info, you can either not have the info in the query, or not log the query.  Either is fine.<p>>The bit about how ""if someone can see your logs you're already boned"" is also message-board-logic more than reality.<p>No it isn't.  If you can read the logs, you are already either the httpd user or root.  Hence you don't need application usernames and passwords anymore, you can just go right ahead and do whatever you like.<p>>Logs are shipped all over the place.<p>Wait, I thought we weren't doing things that a security audit will catch?  Why did you change your mind now that is convenient?  Rather than considering theoretical ""what if they are absolutely retarded and send my username and password in the logs in plain text to internet accessible log storage servers?"", why not consider the reality that if they are that stupid, they will be compromised anyways.  So what is the concern here?  As a user of their system, I know they are either doing things right and I am fine, or doing things wrong I and I am boned.  So, exactly what we knew before the whole GET vs POST debate.  Very helpful.  If they are idiots, then there is nothing I can do to secure my account with them, this is why we don't use the same password for multiple services.<p>>If you have more questions about this stuff, my contact info is in my profile --- just click my username above this comment<p>I would suggest that you read the posting guidelines.",1328125337

3539535,comment,3537976,3539258,1,0,Silhouette,,,"> How can customers expect publishers to refund for games when they (publisher) have no guarantee it didn't work?<p>Well, under UK consumer protection law, goods normally have to meet certain basic guarantees, such as fitness for purpose. Moreover, the presumption is that if they fail within the first few months after the purchase, it's the vendor's problem unless the vendor can show why it shouldn't be. It might seem harsh, but that <i>is</i> what the consumer protection laws here say, and it's a cost of doing business here.<p>I don't see why the same principle should not apply at least as strongly to software, particularly given that software is often relatively expensive, very often of poor quality/compatibility in ways that aren't clear to the purchaser up-front, and usually issuing a refund in such cases will cause very little actual damage to the vendor beyond losing the price of the sale. Surely this all goes at least double for a service where the vendor is providing the software entirely on-line, so their actual damage from issuing a refund is nothing but the admin overhead, and where the vendor can see whether the user has actually been able to run the software effectively as a defence against fraudulent refund claims.",1328125278

3539412,comment,3538585,3539011,3,0,noblethrasher,,,"> For instance, I once saw a Silverlight app that took 20 minutes to initialize because it traversed a tree of relationships using REST. It started out O.K. but as the app grew more complicated it took tens of thousands of requests and an incredible amount of latency.<p>Not that I agree with that particular architecture, but my first question is: why did the Silverlight app discard the knowledge that it had worked hard to discover? If a technician spent 20 minutes figuring out how a thing worked, would he just willfully forget it?<p>> People who are building toy applications can blubber about ""the decoupling of the client from the server"" but the #1 delusion in distributed systems is that you can compose distributed operations the same way you compose function calls in a normal program.<p>The whole idea behind object oriented programming is that you don't compose functions, you let objects pass and respond to messages and record their observations (state).<p>> All of the great distributed algorithms such as Jacobsen's heuristic for TCP and Bittorrent have <i>holistic properties</i> possesed by the system as a whole that are responsible for their success.<p>Meaning that the ""objects"" observe and record information about the world and respond appropriately based on their (recorded) observations. Interetingly enough, Alan Kay said that TCP was one of the few things that was designed well from the start. (Or maybe it was IP, I'm trying to find a source.)<p>>Security is another problem with REST. Security rules are usually about state transitions, not about states. To ensure that security (and integrity) constraints are met, REST applications need to contain error prone code that compares the before and after states to check if the transition is legal. This is in contrast to POX/RPC applications in which it is straightforward to analyse the security impacts of individual RPC calls.<p>That's a good point about  security rules and state transitions but I don't understand the problem, objects are supposed to be responsible for some kind of state and we should let them  worry about their state transitions. Can you provide and example of error prone code that needs to compare the before and after state?<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>REST isn't a scam but the tooling (programming languages and frameworks) just aren't there. Our languages, even the so-called object-oriented ones are still based around the idea of calling procedures. REST works when you're dealing with objects that respond to messages, not imperatives.<p>Alan Kay made the case for something like REST in his 1997 OOPSLA keynote[1] (preceding Fielding's dissertation by 3 years). The idea is that in really big systems (distributed over space and time), the individual components need to be smart enough to learn how to interact with the other components because the system is simply too big to accomodate static knowledge (and I say this as a fan of statically typed languages).<p>[1]<a href=""http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2950949730059754521</a> at 43:00",1328123443

3539379,story,,,8,0,iamjonlee,"After I was frustrated and felt pretty useless- What I've Learned",,"The last post I made on HN was an upset rant about my cofounder and I being disappointed over our second startup. Had I known that I would receive so many replies, I probably would have considered not posting it. However, doing so was probably the best thing Ive ever done so far as a startup entrepreneur. I was strongly encouraged by many others who understood my situation and was given advice by others while being yelled at and criticized by most. It was precisely the combination of all the criticism and encouragement that really totally reevaluate my situation. There was so much wisdom and intelligence embedded within those comments that it really struck a chord with me.<p>(Link to previous rant: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3439277)<p>Ive read every single response and while I didnt get a chance to respond to them (I began working on another startup due to the motivation received), I wanted to leave feedback now and talk about how I feel now, or rather stuff Ive learned now having two unsuccessful startups. Thank you for all the support youve given a fellow HNer.<p>37signals talks about building a product that solves a problem of your own because theres bound to be others like you trying to find the same solution. Like many mentioned, it wasnt so much creating only products that wouldve solve a problem of your own. Given that feedback, I still think that its solid advice. By it being a product that can solve a problem of your own, you know exactly what youd want and create an awesome product for it. But thats where it gets pretty confusing. What you want isnt necessarily a necessity for others, especially when it comes to features. Because youre choosing a product that you want to solve so much, you blind yourself with what you think are core features that MUST be within the app  making the app extremely bloated with no focus. Another point to make is not to begin a startup with biased emotions. Most of the ideas Ive had were simply created to make some fast cash, but wasnt really going to solve a problem of mine. By doing so, I cheated myself because I wasnt as motived nor would I believe in the project as much as I would have if it were a real problem. I understand that in the last post, many were upset because I was still dreaming of making it big and making a lot of money. While I understand that it could be seen as a destructive attitude towards a startup, I disagree. I find that for me personally, the best motivation is to aim for just that. My motivation for making money comes from spending money. Because I have expensive wants, I naturally have a higher goal of how much money Id like to make. I entered the startup community because I desired the opportunity no matter how farfetched to improve my overall financial wellbeing before getting married and being committed to a family. I had a quite well paying stable job previously, but I quit to pursue exactly those kinds of get rich quick dreams. Thank you though for voicing your concerns on this matter though, it truly means a lot.<p>In a way, looking back at this post as suggested, I am glad that things happened with Grooovy the way it did. I knew that what really counted was the knowledge and experience youve gained whenever you actually do mess up on a startup (from having already failed another one prior to Grooovy), but it still didnt help with the feelings of disappointment. I think its only natural that you feel terrible after something doesnt work out for you but its important to snap out of it and decide on your next step because otherwise youd just be wasting time being depressed over something that already happened. (In other words, no use crying over spilt milk.)<p>We had spent so long on Grooovy that we forgot to enjoy ourselves and do what we really wanted to. Right after reading this post, we got the idea to put together a list of all the apps that we had wanted to work on for our own fun but couldnt because of Grooovy. The way we see it now is that well launch an app every 3-6 weeks, so keeping it short while enjoying what we do. We just finished our 1st app on that list, Flux  an app that provides you with a different conversation topic each week, designed to stimulate engaging conversations to questions that have no right answer. Were extremely thankful for Grooovy because Flux would have never been possible without what we learned along the way. It took us less than 12 days to fully design, develop and test the app and it turned out more beautiful and easier to program than we had ever expected. In fact, most important of all, it felt great to finish something we really looked forward to doing, it was extremely fun. This was what we had been looking for and missing this entire time. This is who we are and what we want to do, making apps that mean something to us and not wasting time making assumptions of what others might want or require in the app.<p>(For those interested, feedback is always appreciated: http://www.grooovy.me/flux). In case you google flux, please note that Grooovy has three OOOs in it. Weve worked on the copy a bit to get to the point and get rid of the marketing gibberish as most of you have suggested.<p>The last point I wanted to make was a quote by @maro: A true friend points out your mistakes, even at the risk of losing your friendship. This is extremely important because most of the beta testers we had for Grooovy were acquaintances and people who we werent extremely close to. They all spoke well of our app probably because they didnt want to insult us in any way. The few close friends and family that did test it were a little hesitant, but we chose to ignore it, given that they probably didnt understand what the app was about. That was merely a lie to appease our conscience. Had we listened, we would have put more thought about the core or the focus of the app instead of features that we thought was going to be important for scaling. (Another lesson, dont waste time building your app for scaling in the future. Think about it, but dont overuse precious time on it.)<p>I wanted to also take some time to clarify what Grooovy had been about. Were different from meetup, eventbrite, and grubwithus because we wanted a commitment-free hangout. Ive used all of them but it never solved the problem I had. I didnt want to commit to groups of activities that I need to go back to every week (I dont have time for it.) It sucks that everytime I do show up, people ask where Ive been or why I didnt show up the last week. I wanted a quick casual, lets grab a quick bite or a drink whenever I have time (even if its 12AM midnight at a local milk tea hangout in town), not having to need an plan events far into the future. The vision I had for it was a spontaneous, very casual but fun way of meeting people without needing to overpay for a meal (I personally dont have that kind of money.)<p>I have a lot more to say, but I realize that itll be more appropriate to actually blog about it. Im glad I spoke out because Im sure there are others like me out there, depressed and angry at themselves for having failed a startup. It is because of the amazing support that I got from HN thats made me find my focus again. Thank you to each and every one of you who took the time to read my post, and especially those who went above and beyond to reply to my post and offer to talk with me in case I needed someone to talk to (@nate) and taking the time to proof and offer suggestions for the copy on the website (@thhaar)- Im really grateful for it. Thank you.",1328122972

At the company where I work we have the exact same proces for making a website and making a mobile app. Depending on type of customer we use a waterfall or an agile approach.<p>Fair enough, that you mention the loose points. From your article I got the impression that you think app development can be only be done as a waterfall project because of the toolset. And the point I was trying to make in my post is that my experience tells me otherwise.<p>Maybe my text was not clear on this. I will check it again.<p>To answer your questions: a RESTful API to be used by my app only and not to be consumed by the rest of the world is not such a big deal. Using the mock-up as input I'll create a working prototype in xcode in 2-5 days. After that I'll send it to the customer as soon as possible. The visual designer will design the app. I will implement the design.<p>As software engineers we are hired by our clients because we have knowledge and skills that they don't have.

That being said, I would look at you as a senior developer (assuming that we walked through your MICO project, and I liked what I saw and that I did not see any huge coding no-no's). I would offer you 100k knowing full well that I would be willing to go to 120k if I think you are one of the best developers that I have seen AKA a 10xer.<p>Here are the facts:<p>You have skills in an extremely hot market.<p>Most JS developers know jQuery which != JS. Ext is a larger framework for building large JS apps, it is on par with Dojo. Dojo developers can command 140k. I could retool you to Dojo or a jQuery/Backbone/Require stack in a few weeks. Especially if I have an existing team there to support your transition.<p>You have an open code base that I can review. You built it on your own initiative, this is a strong indicator of passion, which is important.<p>Based on that, if you receive an offer under 90k anywhere on the western or eastern seaboard your are getting low balled. If you are in the midwest I would expect it to be at lest 90k but it may be a little lower.",1328122906

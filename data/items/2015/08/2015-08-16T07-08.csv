10068272,comment,10064914,10066517,0,0,niekb,,,"> [ Hope I am not coming across as too negative, but since you put it in a paper and published it I think it is fair to do some peer review ]<p>No, not at all, your feedback is highly appreciated!
BTW, the paper is a preprint, it is currently under review.<p>- I fully agree with the O(N) vs O(1) issue in the evalPartialDerivative. Also, an optimization possibility I considered is to replace string-valued variable names like &quot;Y&quot; by integers, but this adds some bookkeeping-burden for a creator of a message that works in a programming language other than c++ (for which we do not provide convenience methods for building messages)<p>- I agree with the auto vs (const) auto& point you raised. However, some cap&#x27;n proto types (readers / builders) are copyable types (&quot;handles&quot;), hence they should be using with auto. (And, sometimes, the compiler can do better optimizations when you&#x27;ve passed objects (of small size) by value rather than ref, but this might be different for each specific case; one would have to benchmark.)<p>Regarding expression: &quot;P-10+q^2&quot;:
The string encoding is much shorter indeed, and is an alternative way. 
However, 
 - double values potentially lose precision in a string representation (btw, also this &quot;JSON bridge&quot; I mentioned earlier suffers from this problem) and possibly take up more space than 8 bytes.
- the schema also serves as the grammar of the message format; is a compact &quot;manual&quot;, in that (almost) everything that can be expressed using the schema will be &quot;valid&quot; and accepted by the interpreter.
If one encodes a string, one has to define this grammar separately (one has to define what is a &#x27;valid&#x27; string and what not). Adopting this schema-based solution saved us work.  
- there are typically more objects in a message (&quot;advertisement&quot;), so the string would have to be augmented with information about what it represents in the message.
- also: having a schema-based solution helped us in designing the message format (the types defined in the schema let you think in a more abstract way about the message format), and provides evolvability.<p>Hence, there were certain motivations for choosing this approach that are unrelated to space (bytesize) or runtime performance.",1439711340
10068271,comment,10067860,10068076,0,0,superuser2,,,"The FCC requires that RF transmitters behave cooperatively - using the correct parts of the spectrum, not producing interference on other parts. Verifying this behavior is a relatively sophisticated task of electrical engineering, requiring specialized knowledge, expensive calibrated measurement equipment, RF-isolated test facilities, etc. Naturally, the cost burden for this testing falls on the manufacturer, not the taxpayer.  So... we do allow &quot;just anyone&quot; to sell radio equipment, as long as they can pay to prove it behaves within the limits of the law. But big players like Motorola are in a much better position to do this than a dude in his basement.<p>Carriers have paid big bucks for exclusive licenses to useful swaths of the spectrum, and in return they get enforcement to make sure only devices they control can transmit on their spectrum. The FCC would not license a radio capable of transmitting on Verizon spectrum not approved by Verizon.<p>But this is specific to the radio - the FCC doesn&#x27;t care about the rest of the phone (or whatever device it is). You can buy a cellular radio chip for your Arduino because <i>it</i> is FCC certified and you can only provide inputs like SMS and audio, not an arbitrary signal to transmit.",1439711225

After trying an older now unsupoorted variant from the ETH site which segfaulted, I downloaded Oberon Linux Revival (<a href=""http://oberon.wikidot.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oberon.wikidot.com/</a>), and it worked for me. All files are kept in a single directory, and this includes the complete source (.Mod files), so you can browse these from Linux after dealing with the line endings (e.g. convert \r to \n using tr). There&#x27;s no native Linux source, everything is written in Oberon. X11 is surprisingly accessed using the wire protocol directly.<p>Actually, about half of the Oberon system must even be compiled first (using the &quot;recipe&quot; in OLR.Gadgets.Tool) before these programs can be used in Oberon. There&#x27;s also documentation in form of a &quot;book&quot; (Desktops.OpenDoc Book.Tool) which explains the system on various levels, including the Oberon language.<p>The font size turned out to be too small on my screen (because the bitmapped screen fonts where made for different hardware), and the fonts are hardlinked from the documents, so I shuffled the *.Scr.Fnt files about two sizes down and everything was readable. I also replaced Default.Pal with Light.Pal for better contrast. You can use the OWEIGHT and OHEIGHT environment variables to set the window size.<p>All in all, the &quot;TUI&quot; (textual user interface) is really nice.

If you have evidence that Soylent contains dangerous levels of lead or cadmium you can present it to the FDA who will then intervene on your behalf - they have the power to remove Soylent from the market, to force Soylent to recall product, impose fines etc.<p>The sticker tells you that the product contains some amount of something. It doesn&#x27;t tell you what it contains, nor how much it contains. All you know is that at least one of a list of several hundred chemicals is present in more than (for some examples) trace amounts.<p>For example, the California safe harbor level of lead is 15ug per day. The WHO has a provisional tolerable weekly intake of 25ug per kg of bodyweight, or about 1.5 mg per week.<p>The California safe harbor levels work out to be 15 ug * 7 which is 105 ug, or 0.105 mg per week.  That 0.105 mg per week is very much lower than WHO&#x27;s 1.5 mg per week.<p>Note that there are penalties for not including the note if you need it, but not for including the note if you don&#x27;t need it.  Your product could be totally free of anything and still carry the warning because you want to avoid the risk of sticker non-compliance.",1439709046

What it actually is is a way to get candidates to talk about specific situations they&#x27;ve encountered in their careers and how they handled them. Different interviewers have different principles to focus on, so it prevents them from covering the same territory.<p>Amazon has its problems, but the interview process has always felt pretty fair to me, and I&#x27;ve been on both sides of it.<p>That said: I would never, ever, ask a candidate to tell me about their biggest failure.

Linus Tolvards is definitely not the Ruby-type.<p>And his arguments are sound ... for system programming, C is a much better language because it's simpler, lacks magic, making the pieces of code easier to understand without the bigger context, and it's more portable.<p>And for application-level programming, why would you chose a language without a garbage-collector?",1279267192

The staticity gets in the way, it means the language has a hard time bridging before the ""everything is a String"" world of the wider web and the internal ""everything is such and such type"". These languages are hard (especially with generics) where the web is soft. In Python or Ruby, you can just deserialize JSON to native types, drill down your dicts and lists as needed and call it a day.<p>In C# or Java, you'll have to define exactly how your dicts nest and everything (or give up type safety), and that means you have a much lower flexibility.<p>Finally, C-inherited Java are <i>dreadful</i> at string munging.

As btilly points out, companies in the U.S. are almost required to <i>not</i> say what you did wrong, for fear of lawsuits.

His 'const' example is jibberish and the line about adding two integers with templates doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I guess the response to this would be that these points were exaggerations, mere literary style figures, which is fine. But it does take away from the quality of it as a serious post.<p>And finally it's not a critique. A critique implies some level of sophistication, an honest attempt to understand something and providing well thought-out arguments against the trade offs that were made in the design, or different viewpoints on fundamental issues. This is just a rant, touching on some of the more superficial shortcomings of C++ that are easily worked around and that for the most part haven't hampered tens of thousands of C++ programmers to use the language successfully for 20 years. A rant, yes. Venting, OK. But a critique, this is not.",1279264540

1520527,comment,1519944,1519944,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"I agree with most of what he says but not with his memory management argument. In C++ you could do something like this:<p><pre><code>  f() {\n    LinkedList list;\n    populate(list);\n    use(list);\n    //forget\n  }\n</code></pre>\nFreeing the list elements is done in one place only, in the destructor of LinkedList. In C, you have to call some kind of free function in every single place a LinkedList is used. The burden of managing memory is on the user of a library, not on its creator. I don't think this is enough to justify using C++ though.",1279264291

In fact, you can probably improve how well you do so much that even a mediocre developer can come out looking very good.<p>So why is that bad? Well, for one thing, the questions asked usually aren't directly to being good at your job. Consider the classic ""How can you detect loops in a singly-linked list without modifying nodes / keeping accounting information around?"" Very, very few people are going to come up with the correct answer to that question without having seen it before especially in a high pressure interview environment. Yet people ask it all the time in interviews. Why? You're just selecting for people who have had to interview a lot (got rejected a lot).<p>A newer style of interview that I quite like is to ask someone to write a moderate chunk of code with a laptop, access to the internet, and a few hours. At least you're measuring something that's directly related to software development.",1279264038

Actually my code (unreleased but working prototype for a year) is an nginx server with a CMS module using V8 for scripting and templating web pages. Code is C (nginx  module + w/ nginx-api) and C++/JS for the CMS. So I cross 3 languages. Works like a charm: ~6K req/s for complex queries (cached disk access with 1+ lstat() call every second.) Memory usage contained very well (always <20MB.) It's so good I don't touch the GC. Also since its security model for Chrome is among the best the ""workers"" can be recycled very fast if you create a good context.<p>The problem with V8, as with almost anything, is it doesn't support well threading and its GC can be a bit unpredictable like any other automagic memory management interpreter. But even so, there are ways to control it.<p>I certainly relate to what you wrote because I used to be a C++ dev in mid-90s (wintel, shivers.) But if you have some time, have a look at V8 for developers. It rocks. Also the newsgroup has a great community.",1279263915

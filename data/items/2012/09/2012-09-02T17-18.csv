The journalists, subs and everyone else involved in producing a quality product were at their wits end as the management tried to take us ever closer to the minimal viable product they could put advertising around. A team of 14 running five weekly papers was fired and replaced by existing labour cut'n'pasting articles from the main daily paper produced at the site.<p>Believe me, journalists know that their once respected profession is going to hell in a handcart. But it's not their fault, and largely there's not much they can do about it.<p>It's also hard for normal folk to see this because a very, very few writers get larded with resources, oodles of time to investigate stories, and big salaries, and these are the ones that are talked about.

4467610,comment,4465956,4466916,2,0,lotharbot,,,"> <i>""The data based approach to cheating detection.""</i><p>I've been really impressed by this recently.  Even in areas where it doesn't seem like it should be hard to plausibly fake, it turns out there's a lot of subtlety that might be missed.<p>Here, it was the checkpoint-by-checkpoint splits and the photographs.  In a fake Minecraft game [0] it's the number of blocks that have been mined versus the materials available for building tools (if sticks are rare, you're not going to waste them making pickaxes to strip mine plain stone) and the number of structures that have been built (millions of blocks got mined, but not used?)  I've thought about building a ""wall transparency"" detector for another video game that would track a player's orientation in relation to players behind a wall from them, profile the average player, and then show that certain players are able to track others through walls.<p>There is an incredible amount of technical knowledge even in seemingly mundane pursuits like running.  That's what makes it possible to spot cheats even without spotting the exact cheating mechanism.<p>[0] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413499"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4413499</a>",1346608224

I click in the middle of the path and then shift-end the cursor. What should I see in the content pane?<p>Second thing to consider is how it's going to work on the file systems with lag. Anything over-the-network. Not only moving the cursor left and right would generate a lot of traffic, it would also fail to provide feedback comparable to that of local drives.<p>Third, take a step back and think who would actually use this. For example, the only time I use Location field is to <i>copy</i> current path to be pasted elsewhere. I tried remembering when I actually typed anything except for c:\temp in there and I can't. I'm sure there are people who <i>do</i> type in long paths, but the question here how many of them are there and if the UI should be optimized for their usage. If they comprise a percentage point, then clearly all this optimization is pointless -- it may very well still exist, but it should be off by default. In other words, as nice as this exercise is, it jumps to the design phase without first defining the problems it is trying to solve nor its target audience.<p>--<p>As others have noted W7 has something similar in Windows Explorer, but the field switches between the breadcrumb and text input modes.

The problem with the article is it frames the issue as one of ""bias"" but , as you point out, that is a strawman, and this is not your normal case of Bias.  Its not the reporting of some true things at the omission of others. Its not asking questions that lead to a similar result.<p>(1) Fabrication vs Bias.  The ""journalist"" has no data to support his suggestion.  It is malicious in intent. It isn't that it is a ""bias"" to one side or the other.  Its the tactical depoloyment of that.

Make jokes about rape and you will end up  in court for creating a <i>hostile work environment</i>.

Do these people also look foolish now?  Probably, a bit.  We should expect some articles coming forth to protect the subjects reputation a bit.  By doing this, the authors are of course acting in their own self interest.

The bias was anti one party.  Thus, implicitly, it was pro the other. Even if this remark was in your favour, would you want to be associated with manipulative, fabricating, bull-baiter employee?

The ""Antennagate"" (which one might argue wasn't a ""-gate"" at all) is the only ""flop"" from Apple (product-wise) in the past few years. iPhones, iPads and Macs are selling like hot cakes, and as much as many nerds disagree with Apple's legal actions, no word can be said about them being ""flops"". They're all incredible machines (Mac is incredible for developers and nave users alike, but iOS is probably more suited to the users rather than most developers - however only a fraction of a percent of population are developers).",1346607445

Journalists still need to report the facts, and in that sense, we <i>should</i> expect them to be objective.<p>Unfortunately, reporting the news is usually not like reading a clock.  Composing any article involves making a variety of decisions in a variety of circumstances -- where to be, who to quote, which connections to prior events to draw, how much background to report -- that all affect what goes into an article and what does not, and which give it an inherent perspective.  Two journalists might write articles which consist entirely of reporting objective facts, yet provide quite different narratives about the same events.<p>The demand for ""objectivity"" becomes unreasonable when it asks for even this curational perspective to be eliminated.  There is plenty of room for a greater number of independent perspectives in our news sources, even <i>within</i> journalists' obligations to objectivity and ""straight reporting.""",1346606134

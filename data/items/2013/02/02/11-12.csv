Assertions stop the program flow if their condition is not met (an exception is thrown) and normally a code block upstream should handle this case.<p>I can only speculate, but either the assertion was left in the code despite being only intended for debugging/testing (ie. it was meant to be there only temporarily) or the upstream code has a bug that causes it not to catch the exception.<p>Either way, it is not handled and therefore bubbles up the whole code chain until some monitor in OS X or Objective C terminates the program because it sees a program error.<p>Someone at Apple forgot a test case feeding text with File:/// to DataDetectors.",1359804839

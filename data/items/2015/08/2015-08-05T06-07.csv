Comparing to SVN&#x27;s ability to checkout portions of a repo instead of the whole repo doesn&#x27;t do much good in systems that aren&#x27;t designed to handle that sort of workflow.<p>Whether or not one should go monolithic or project-based depends on how tightly integrated those projects are.  Folks like Google and Facebook and OpenBSD&#x27;s dev team develop all their things under a single source tree because those things are pretty tightly integrated and designed to interoperate.  Other folks develop each of their things in a separate repo because they expect those things to be independently useful (OpenBSD&#x27;s subprojects <i>do</i> happen to be independently useful, but AFAIK the priority is generally &quot;OpenBSD first, everyone else second&quot;).<p>Multi-repository environments can also be very manageable depending on the language, runtime, etc.  Dividing things into do-one-thing-and-do-it-well chunks (perhaps gems in Ruby land, or crates in Rust land, or packages in Perl land, or whatever) goes a long way toward alleviating the typical non-atomicity of multi-repo setups.  Of course, this tends to be easier for open-source projects than closed-source projects (though the closed-source camp can have some of this fun, too; using Ruby as an example, one can run a private gem server just by running the &quot;gem server&quot; command, or - if using Bundler - can even install dependencies directly from Git repos), but it&#x27;s still a possibility.<p>Plus, the whole &quot;well Google says it&#x27;s more productive for them, so we should take it as a general rule&quot; vibe doesn&#x27;t really sit well with me.",1438754649

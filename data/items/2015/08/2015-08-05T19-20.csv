There&#x27;s angel investing. There&#x27;s IPOs, naturally. There&#x27;s no magic spell to get you into a startup and get you equity.

They&#x27;re primitives used in the construction of other cryptographic tools. Some cases where you might use a fast collision-resistant hash:<p>* Timing-attack-resistant string comparison: if you&#x27;re comparing API keys, you should hash them both first to prevent an attacker from guessing the keys a character at a time.<p>* HMAC (look it up).<p>* One can implement key stretching functions by applying fast collision-resistant hashes multiple times.<p>* Signing (one can hash a message and sign the hash, which provides as much security as signing the message itself).<p>* Fingerprinting (a fast hash of a public key can be used as shorthand to verify public key ownership without having to read off the entire key).<p>* Addressing (Bitcoin uses a fast hash of a public key as an address).",1438804489

The numbers are entirely typical across a wide range of such comparisons.<p>With an interpreter or JIT, you need to load all your code at startup and process it. Generally, _all_ of your dependencies need to be loaded and parsed upfront, either converted to some internal in-memory representation or JIT&#x27;d directly to machine code. This will allocate a bunch of heap structures during the processing, and the end result is a bunch of data that needs to stay resident and can&#x27;t easily be shared with other processes.<p>With AOT, you mmap() in a file. The OS only pages in the code you execute, and can page it back out as needed. Pages are shared between all processes running the same executable.<p>At sandstorm.io our rule of thumb is that an app written in Node, Ruby, Python, PHP, etc. will take 100MB of RAM while an app written in C++, Rust, or Go will take 2MB. Since Sandstorm runs per-user (and even per-document) app instances, this is a pretty big deal.<p>The good news is that <a href=""https://github.com/google/snappy-start"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/google/snappy-start</a> <i>should</i> fix this problem: by checkpointing the process after it finishes its parsing/JITing but before it starts handling requests, we can get an mmap-able starting state that is very much like an AOT-compiled binary. At least, in theory -- there&#x27;s still a bunch of work to do for this to actually work in practice.<p>> The resulting docker image shrunk from 668MB to 4.3MB<p>While I would expect the Go image to be smaller (since Go builds static binaries, so literally all you need in the image is the binary), I suspect that the 668MB Java image was at least 90% unnecessary garbage that was not actually needed at runtime. Unfortunately the package managers we all use are not optimized for containers; instead they evolved targeting systems with dedicated disks that can easily absorb gigabytes of bloat.<p>In Debian, for example, every package implicitly depends on coreutils. That&#x27;s perfectly reasonable when installing an OS on a machine: you almost certainly need a working shell to boot and administer your machine. But a <i>container</i> can get by just fine without coreutils, and a typical web server probably (hopefully) doesn&#x27;t need to call out to a shell. Even if a shell is needed, busybox/toybox is probably sufficient and will take a lot less space.<p>Packages also often contain things like documentation, unit tests, etc. which obviously aren&#x27;t needed in a container.<p>For Sandstorm.io we deal with this problem by running the app in a mode where we trace all the files it actually uses, and then we build a package containing only those. It mostly works and manages to keep packages reasonably-sized, but it does lead to bugs of the form: &quot;I forgot to test this feature while tracing, so the assets it requires didn&#x27;t make it into the package.&quot; We&#x27;re looking for better options.",1438804104

It&#x27;s the best computing experience since my C64 days.<p>But when it comes to services I tend to avoid them as much as I can. Latest example: Apple music.<p>I was a little annoyed by Spotify&#x27;s continuously disappearing music tracks so I was eager to try out iTunes Music. But the problems started when I tried to get into the trial: You need a valid* credit card.<p>Now valid is a pretty interesting definition because I&#x27;m from Germany, currently living in Germany but my banking is done via a Dutch bank (back from when I lived there). So my credit card is dutch. And I live in Germany. But it&#x27;s the EU so it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, right?<p>Right. And no one has ever raised an eyebrow when I used a credit card that has been issued by a Dutch bank with my German address (not even the online poker websites I frequent from time to time). Not even once I had any problems with that. I&#x27;m paying my taxes in Germany via my Dutch bank account. The German tax office accepts it (they even issue transfers to that account). So if the German tax office (which still hasn&#x27;t completely switched to electronic tax filing) can deal with that case then everyone on this planet should be able to. Well, expect for Apple. I just can not use that credit card with anything iTunes related. I get always an &quot;invalid country error&quot;.<p>Now I&#x27;m in Germany, I&#x27;m from Germany, my iTunes account is a German iTunes account. But the fact that my credit card has been issued by a bank in a country that&#x27;s just 20km from my current residence makes it invalid for Apple. A country that is part of the EU. It&#x27;s like I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use a credit card from California when I were living in Washington.<p>So I have to buy those pre-paid iTunes cards to top up my account. And so I had to add three months of pre-paid money to my iTunes account just to start the 3 months free trial.<p>Everything OK? Nope! I was too bold and I opted for a &quot;family account&quot;. Now the most funny thing: Even though I am in the free trial period for the &quot;family account&quot; and I have enough money in my iTunes account to pay for the service I can&#x27;t use the family sharing feature because for that I would need a valid credit card. iTunes just aborts with an &quot;add a valid credit card&quot; error when I try to configure family sharing.<p>It&#x27;s like Kafka has risen from his grave and started a music streaming service.<p>/rant",1438803771

Because CL has good tools for doing non-local control flow that aren&#x27;t bound up in its condition/exception system it winds up strictly more expressive (IMHO) than languages that conflate these.<p>What I&#x27;ve noticed from languages that have traditional try/catch exception handling (especially when that&#x27;s the only non-local control flow available) is that the mechanism of error handling is seen as DEEP MAGIC by their users.  If you separate it out into non-local control flow and a protocol for communicating exception handlers as CL does, the &quot;magical&quot; properties go away since it can be seen how the condition system could be implemented.<p>Or at least that&#x27;s how it worked for me.",1438803622

Because we accept the power structure of feudalism.<p>But many doubt there is any power structure in capitalism.<p>Landless wage labourers? Yes.  Debt based economies? Yes.  Taxes given as handouts to the owners? Yes.<p>The differences between the structure of two are far more subtle than most people like to believe.<p>We are at a point on political democracy, that&#x27;s great - but economically we are still kinda stuck in the 1700s ... We could try to democratize that too.<p>Part of the problem is that neoliberalism suggests that everyone should act like an entrepreneur, a CEO if you will.  This is actually as silly as implying that if everyone acted like a prince or princess in feudalism, it would have been a fair system.<p>But you point to the &quot;self made man&quot;. Statistically speaking, those are about as rare as someone marrying into royalty in classical feudalism.  Pointing to that fact of course, didn&#x27;t make feudalism fair either.<p>There&#x27;s a real, leaky (they all are), power structure imposed by the system that can&#x27;t be undone by the power of magical thinking.",1438801445

These are true for me at least.<p>1) Context switching is expensive. Know your tools/language well, avoid interruptions.<p>2) You probably only have something like 4-5 hours max per day where your brain can effectively handle hard thinking tasks. Accept this and try to plan your day to get the most out of this time. For a lot of people this tends to be early in the morning, others late at night.<p>3) Plan all of your low cognitive tasks outside of this time. Bug reports, user support, whatever. I&#x27;m also a sysadmin so I have a whole bunch of these tasks.<p>4) If you have a lot of those low-cognitive cost tasks, make sure that they&#x27;re well documented so you can have a wiki open on one monitor and a shell/web page/whatever in the other so you can get through lots of these quickly and without invoking many brain cells.<p>5) related to 2 - you probably only have a maximum of 50 hours a week where you can work effectively. The odd 70 week is probably fine, but do this on a regular/continual basis and your cognitive ability starts to decline, depression/burn-out/resentment and other things start to creep in.<p>6) related to 5 - keep some semblance of a work/life balance. Eat well, do regular strenuous excersize, see your friends/family, get away from work for a few days, etc.<p>7) enjoy what you do.",1438801444

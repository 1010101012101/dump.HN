They have, fairly recently, drawn people in from Yahoo and Google's networking teams - so that's really encouraging, but I wonder if there were any architectural choices that were made earlier that might need some major overhaul to provide the resiliency they need.<p>Further, as they scale out their infrastructure by expanding their datacenter footprint in California, and ultimately bring up other sites, I am sure they will stabilize greatly.",1301521906

The python way is a little bit easier to read but the clojure way makes the library simpler.<p><pre><code>   line = '+'.join(['-'*(width*3)]*3)\n   line (join \+ (repeat 3 (join (repeat (* 3 width) \-))))\n   </code></pre>\nThe thing that makes python shorter here is that they alow math on non number. I don't think that a good idea in general but that up to the language designers taste. The diffrence between the code is basiclly that in clojure you have to use repeat two times instead of * and one more join.<p>So only real diffrences are on the first line clojure uses apply and on the second repeat instead of join.<p>I think is just a matter of training.

He's not upset he can buy fewer baseball teams, he's upset that his status was being lowered and he was being disrespected and treated as prey/<p>As far as the former partners go, Cringely claims Allen has been dissociated financially for a long time:<p>> Maybe thats just the sort of fiduciary discussion board members have to have, but it didnt go over well with Paul Allen, who never returned to Microsoft, and over the next eight years, made huge efforts to secure his wealth from the fate of Microsoft. He sold large blocks of shares on a regular basis no matter whether the price was high or low. Then in October and November of 2000, just as he was finally leaving the Microsoft board, Allen did a series of financial transactions involving derivative securities called collars, that are a combination of a right to buy and a right to sell the stock at different prices such that both his upside and downside financial potential are limited. By the end of 2000, though Allen technically still owned 136 million Microsoft shares, his wealth was for practical purposes separate from that of Gates, Ballmer, and the rest of Microsoft.<p>Inasmuch as Cringely reported essentially the same anecdote as in the _Vanity Fair_ excerpts, I'm inclined to take him at his word when he writes about Allen's finances.",1301520156

Never mind the stuff it does behind the scenes, most people think if they click a ""like"" button, their friends will know they like it.  It promotes self-reinforcing behaviour.<p>+1 doesn't do that.  It's not immediately apparent what it's for, and it offers no incentive for use without knowing what it is.  The icon itself doesn't tell you anything.  ""What is it, some kind of movie?""  A simple thumbs up would have been much simpler, much more intuitive, and likely to gain greater traction.  A simple note under the search bar saying, ""Find what you were looking for?  Give it the thumbs up and help us deliver better results"" would likely have led to much higher usage.  The average user doesn't need to know what it's being used for.  Calling it ""social"" doesn't help in this context, because nobody thinks of social when they think of Google.

Accountability to others helps.\n- Take time off and travel. If you're doing fine in college and getting decent grades etc., and can afford to skip a semester - do it! College is the last time you will have a chance to do completely new things.

10578152,comment,10570444,10577789,0,0,theseoafs,,,"> Is manual resource management with linear types a must? Because that&#x27;s a big bummer.<p>Manual resource management is generally a given in functional languages with linear types. Since your types are linear, you need functions which can destroy your linear types, and generally those functions are called manually. There are certain other approaches you could adopt in a new language -- e.g. you could use C++-like &quot;destructors&quot; where if you don&#x27;t do anything with a value and it falls out of scope, a function to dispose of the value automatically gets called.  I haven&#x27;t seen that implemented in a functional language with linear types, though.  I don&#x27;t know how well it would play with type inference.  Generally, though, linearly typed languages don&#x27;t worry about this.<p>> Also how is that compare to Rust?<p>Rust doesn&#x27;t have linear types -- Rust has unique/affine types. An affine value can be used 0 or 1 times (unlike linear values which can only be used exactly 1 time).  So in Rust it&#x27;s possible to &quot;lose&quot; a value by throwing it away or by creating an RC cycle and leaking it.  A linear type system wouldn&#x27;t let you do that.  However, Rust does have those automatic destructors which keep you from having to destroy everything manually.<p>> If it&#x27;s not, is it possible to incorporate it into an existing language with e.g. HM types?<p>HM in and of itself knows nothing about linearity and so you need additional support from the typechecker to implement it.  Plenty of languages have extended HM to include linearity, though.",1447716898

We nerds (and I am among this bunch) don&#x27;t really like the fact that popularity, &quot;emotional IQ&quot;, and social influence are not quantifiable, but we are judged on them, anyway. When someone wants to be judged on very clear metrics, being told there is a mysterious &quot;other&quot; metric that seems to reside in the head of one person, is uncomfortable, maybe even frightening.<p>The thing is, however, that <i>everything</i> you do will also have this metric applied to it, by everyone you interact with, and it is a metric that impacts success. Any sales interaction you have, any hiring process you implement, any investor meeting you have, etc. All human interactions will be judged with this metric in addition to the other metrics. Is it &quot;fair&quot;? I don&#x27;t know. But, it is reality. Given that, having someone who is good at it, on a team that is otherwise <i>not</i> good at it (and having read pg on nerds and popularity, I can surmise he considers himself not terribly good at it; nerds in general are famously socially inept), is worthwhile.<p>Which raises the concern that the social ineptitude of a technically brilliant founder might prevent them from getting into YC (and I think that is the fear being expressed in this thread). I can say that most YC founders I know are charming people; nerdy, mostly, but still charming and socially adept, at least when interacting with similarly nerdy peers. Is this a prerequisite for startup success? And, is it actually what is being selected for when we talk about this &quot;social radar&quot;? I don&#x27;t know. I don&#x27;t think I have this particular skill strongly enough to recognize a hit and a miss on these metrics, though I can spot technical fakery a mile away (and there&#x27;s a surprisingly high number of applicants who are technically incompetent trying to pass for competent; I suspect few make it past the application process).",1447716852

It often is driven by a desire to feel superior to another and comes from a place of insecurity.<p>Being a good judge of someone is being observant and weighing the complexities of what someone presents of themselves. Think lady justice with the scales - taking a whole picture before making judgment, and avoiding bringing in one&#x27;s own motivations, emotions, or concerns in the process. Lady justice&#x27;s blindfold is the symbol for this objectivity.<p>As you can see they&#x27;re totally different in how they filter data, when they make judgment, and their relationship to the other.<p>You&#x27;re right, the criteria used doesn&#x27;t seem to be visible. While feedback on particular aspects of an interview NOT related to social cues would be helpful, feedback for social cues & character is just <i>not something anyone owes you</i> - no matter how emotionally difficult an interaction may be to participate in.<p>There are likely ways you can get feedback on these kinds of things - friends or coaches - but ultimately its not the kind of thing that one studies directly for.

You can try all you want to study how to project the right microexpressions and whatever but that&#x27;s endlessly complex and you&#x27;ll lack sufficient data to optimize, not least of which is because every person and situation is unique. This may go against some notions of fairness but lack of visibility and feedback is just part of the domain of social interactions.<p>Fundamentally the character & social cues you give off are an output of what you do with other inputs - how you view and treat people, what you&#x27;re motivated by, the time you take to strengthen your own observational skills (such as through mindfulness practice) and how well you know yourself, etc. If you&#x27;re concerned about giving off good social cues, you&#x27;ll get a heck of a lot farther focusing on building an awareness of whats going on in your mind, in the conversation, and with the other person that is triggering those cues.

A big part of this is preventing management from giving a sweetheart deal on something worth a lot, to their friend/relative/whoever (e.g. selling the customer list for $1 to their friend&#x27;s company), vs. making sure everyone who has a claim on said assets can get the most back as possible. A lot of arguments happen here, this is the main point of the rdio situation, whether the sale to Pandora is the best possible outcome for everyone.<p>(3) The company&#x27;s assets get distributed as follows:<p>Employees -- most states give employees&#x27; unpaid wages preferential treatment in bankruptcy, under the same legal doctrine of why employees can&#x27;t be held civilly liable (sued) doing something under control of their employer -- employers have a general duty to care for/protect their employees. (Note that neither the high priority bankruptcy payment, nor the liability protection, applies to contractors. Keep this in mind next time you think contractors are &quot;overpaid&quot; earning 2x as much as a W2, on top of the fact that they get no benefits and have to pay both sides of FICA)<p>Secured creditors -- any creditor whose claim is &quot;secured&quot; or &quot;backed up&quot; by some kind of asset, e.g. mortgage lenders.<p>Unsecured creditors -- 1099 contractors, lessors, all vendors, debenture (bond) holders, basically anyone who claims they&#x27;re &quot;owed&quot; by the company.<p>And finally, lastly, equity holders (stockholders). They don&#x27;t necessary have to get zero, but often do, because they&#x27;re so far down the list of who gets paid (what investment bankers call &quot;capital structure seniority&quot; -- they&#x27;re very junior).<p>So yes, it might be more or less ratable within each class, but there&#x27;s no guarantee that &quot;shareholders will get nothing&quot;, nor is it strictly proportional.<p>This is the garbage collection of capitalism and I find it fascinating.",1447715498

I failed to catch that, as that&#x27;s not how larger chains like Best Buy and Wal-Mart work (you tend to just deal with them directly, and they can demand that by being large), and for my kind of business they are whom I care about ;P.<p>FWIW, I thereby will argue that Facebook is acting more like a &quot;retailer&quot; than either a landlord or a distributor ;P. You are trying to get space on their shelves so people &quot;browsing&quot; see the things you are selling. You technically can create your own store somewhere, but people don&#x27;t randomly browse there.<p>One of my favorite stories of the relationship between a retailer and a supplier is that of Wal-Mart dealing with record labels in the mid-2000s. Wal-Mart, Target, and Best Buy represented over half of all music sales, but from the perspective of those stores music was, at best, a loss-leader for stereo systems.<p><a href=""http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wal-mart-wants-10-cds-20041012"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/wal-mart-wants-10-cds...</a><p>> &quot;This wasn&#x27;t framed as a gentle negotiation,&quot; says one label rep. &quot;It&#x27;s a line in the sand -- you don&#x27;t do this, then the threat is this.&quot; (Wal-Mart denies these claims.) ... &quot;We&#x27;re in such a competitive world, and you can&#x27;t reach consumers if you&#x27;re not in Wal-Mart,&quot; admits another label executive.<p>> While Wal-Mart represents nearly twenty percent of major-label music sales, music represents only about two percent of Wal-Mart&#x27;s total sales. &quot;If they got out of selling music, it would mean nothing to them,&quot; says another label executive. &quot;This keeps me awake at night.&quot;<p>> For the music industry, having such a dominant retailer is like being stuck in a bad marriage. Whereas traditional music retailers took advertising money from the labels to push new releases in Sunday newspaper circulars, Wal-Mart barely advertises locally. It relies on national campaigns, where it promotes its own low-price policy. &quot;Wal-Mart has no long-term care for an individual artist or marketing plan, unlike the specialty stores, which were a real business partner,&quot; says one former distribution executive. &quot;At Wal-Mart, we&#x27;re a commodity and have to fight for shelf space like Colgate fights for shelf space.&quot;",1447715211

On the other hand, both are better with respect to discovery, and mixcloud has something similar to user stations in that mixes are curated and tracklists are available (albeit in a silly manner[1]).

There&#x27;s also a difference in store design that makes it really easy to find things on steam you didn&#x27;t know before and are relevant to you, even if they&#x27;re really old; while the stores on consoles are utterly useless if you are not buying the newest games or know which game you&#x27;re looking for.<p>As for the freemium comment, you didn&#x27;t understand him correctly. There&#x27;s different ways to do freemium. One way is to sell cheats, and design the game so it becomes progressively more unfun to play without cheats. (mobile games) The other is to make the game free to play and offer either cosmetics (tf2) or pieces of the gameplay (warthunder) for cash. The latter is really nice, and seems to happen exclusively on PC.",1447714936

As in, most of the work is already done with process shrinks easy too. On top of that, platform ASIC&#x27;s or S-ASIC&#x27;s with mapping to FPGA&#x27;s. Anyone that used the fabs would get the I.P. free or dirt cheap with that used to make more. All the stuff that isn&#x27;t a competitive advantage is gratis.<p>The other one that would kick ass is heavy investment into EDA tooling. China itself may or may not need it with the rampant piracy. However, driving the prices of EDA synthesis, verification, etc tools down to four to five digits might make the market really interesting. Especially with lots of reference I.P. and flows. That plus inexpensive, maskless prototyping like eASIC does.<p>Someone might steal my idea with me posting it all over the place but I don&#x27;t have the capital to pull it off. So, steal away and get me EDA that&#x27;s as cheap as Windows. :)",1447714806

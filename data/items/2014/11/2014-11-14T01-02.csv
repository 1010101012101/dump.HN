This is a recipe for anything on the application processor being pwned beyond recognition.<p>The last time I played with Qualcomm/CDMA (around 2007), I used proprietary software (QPST) to do undocumented incantations to clone an ESN from one phone to another. When I called the number, both rang. Picking both up led to hearing the conversation in both. This tells you <i>precisely</i> how good their idea of &quot;encryption&quot; is.<p>The entire Qualcomm ecosystem is a black box, and is there even a remote chance they don&#x27;t have a partnership with the NSA? I&#x27;m sure San Diego is seen as a key national security interest - if it weren&#x27;t &quot;secured&quot; by the NSA, then China/Russia intelligence would do so (or an uppity colony looking for a leg up).<p>I&#x27;ll happily eat these words when there&#x27;s an open source GSM or CDMA stack, portable hardware to run it, and the ability to pay for network access anonymously.

8605435,comment,8605186,8605281,0,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> It was not accompanied by increased investment into the actual wires that ran into peoples&#x27; homes. Indeed, it eliminated any incentive to invest in those wires--why pour billions of dollars into infrastructure you&#x27;ll have to lease out at cost to your competitors?<p>The trouble is without competition they have exactly the same lack of incentive. Why invest in those wires when you can charge customers the same amount whether you make the internet faster or not, and the customers don&#x27;t have any better alternative?<p>There are two valid ways out of this. The first is to somehow create competition at the wire level, but that seems rather implausible. Running new fiber to every American household is so expensive that nobody wants to do it unless they can have a monopoly. Creating competition would require some plurality of companies to do it even though the competition, if effective, would eat all of their margins. If anyone can describe a way to make that happen it would probably be worthy of a Nobel prize.<p>Which leaves the second alternative, which is writing the incentives into the regulations. Set it up so that the nationwide average ISP speed is regularly measured and the ISPs with above average network performance are allowed to charge more by an amount that justifies making regular upgrades.<p>Or just require the last mile provider to install fiber everywhere once and then let the competing ISPs who lease it provide their own terminating equipment, since the terminating equipment is the thing that needs to be upgraded but isn&#x27;t the thing that constitutes a natural monopoly.<p>> People mention the &quot;unbundling&quot; requirement as if its a panacea, comparing it to what has been done in Europe, but ignore what makes that policy work in places like the U.K.--the company that owns the wires is a sanctioned monopoly, protected from competition, that is guaranteed return on investment through statutory means.<p>Your criticism seems to be that we aren&#x27;t doing exactly the same thing they&#x27;re doing. Is there a reason we can&#x27;t just do exactly the same thing they&#x27;re doing?",1415930330

Dietary Supplements and Cancer Prevention: Balancing Potential Benefits Against Proven Harms
 Authors
Abstract<p>Nutritional supplementation is now a multibillion-dollar industry, and about half of all US adults take supplements. Supplement use is fueled in part by the belief that nutritional supplements can ward off chronic disease, including cancer, although several expert committees and organizations have concluded that there is little to no scientific evidence that supplements reduce cancer risk. To the contrary, there is now evidence that high doses of some supplements increase cancer risk. Despite this evidence, marketing claims by the supplement industry continue to imply anticancer benefits. Insufficient government regulation of the marketing of dietary supplement products may continue to result in unsound advice to consumers. Both the scientific community and government regulators need to provide clear guidance to the public about the use of dietary supplements to lower cancer risk.

I expect strongly that at least <i>some</i> amount of actual shooting-war will be required to correct this situation.<p>What I&#x27;m suggesting that a necessary step in the basic concept of having a police force. The nature of the job by necessity requires us to grant some extra powers and exceptions in law to the people we hire to enforce it. Unfortunately, history shows that not only can we not trust that those powers will not be abused, we also cannot trust that the usual check against abuses of power will be implemented (or even attempted at all). Various types of regulatory capture, institutional corruption, and far too many people choosing to look the other way have demonstrated very clearly a list of methods that do <i>not</i> work.<p>The key problem in all of that tends to center around someone being able to abuse their powers freely while retaining a very high level of trust. Tying police powers to the camera separates these issues, and <i>might</i> be the <i>start</i> of a much-larger plan to fix this mess we&#x27;re in. I don&#x27;t expect that the people currently benefiting from the situation will like it. In fact, as they are (by definition) violent criminals, I expect the people committing the worst abuses will fight back. Hard.<p>I suggest we start solving that problem <i>now</i>, regardless of the difficulty. Power accumulates, so this will only be harder in the future. I don&#x27;t have a miracle solution for how to <i>enact</i> these ideas - that is going to be hard regardless..",1415929427

What a mess.<p>- Comments on pull requests are sent as soon as they are created. Gerrit allows you to make many comments on a change, as drafts, and then send them all in one go, sending just a single email. This is much easier to manage for a large project.<p>- Gerrit has the notion of multiple &#x27;patch sets&#x27; for a particular change, and you can see diffs between patch sets, so it&#x27;s much easier to progressively review large changes.<p>And there are many other small issues with the GitHub pull request process that make it untenable for the Go project.",1415928885

Someone posted this the other day: <a href=""http://www.louisvilleco.gov/SERVICES/CityManagersOffice/FranchiseAgreements/CableFranchiseInformation/2013ComcastCableFranchiseRenewal/tabid/766/Default.aspx#faq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.louisvilleco.gov/SERVICES/CityManagersOffice/Fran...</a>. That page describes the cable franchise negotiations for Louisville, CO, population 4,500. The page notes: &quot;Should another cable provider want to offer cable service in Louisville the City would offer that company the same franchise opportunity that Comcast now has. <i>To date, no other service providers have asked for a franshise</i>.&quot;<p>The only reason phone infrastructure got built in rural America at all is that the Telecom Act&#x27;s Universal Service Fund diverted billions of dollars a year from long-distance customers to paying to subsidize service for rural customers. What will the free market do when you take that away?<p>> But in 2004, the FCC took steps to limit competition, turning away from key provisions of the 1996 Telecom Act. They set aside unbundling requirements which serve as a key bridge for competitive carriers. By circumventing Congress this way, the Bush-appointed Chairman of the FCC was able to turn back a competitive tide, creating an intentional duopoly on Internet access in the US.<p>The &quot;competitive tide&quot; under unbundling is a fiction. In the early 1990&#x27;s, you could order DSL from a large number of ISP&#x27;s . . . all of which used the same copper wire the AT&T monopoly had put in the ground decades before. It was not accompanied by increased investment into the actual wires that ran into peoples&#x27; homes. Indeed, it eliminated any incentive to invest in those wires--why pour billions of dollars into infrastructure you&#x27;ll have to lease out at cost to your competitors?<p>People mention the &quot;unbundling&quot; requirement as if its a panacea, comparing it to what has been done in Europe, but ignore what makes that policy work in places like the U.K.--the company that owns the wires is a sanctioned monopoly, <i>protected from competition</i>, that is <i>guaranteed</i> return on investment through statutory means.<p>It&#x27;s illustrative to look at places in the U.S. where the market for telecom is working pretty well. In Chicago, there is cable via Comcast, and both AT&T and RCN building FTTP networks. In a place like Baltimore, RCN wouldn&#x27;t be <i>allowed</i> to build its network, because they only serve the wealthier neighborhoods from the Loop northward. When local governments intervene in the market and make such deployments impossible, rational market participants do not respond by building a bunch of unprofitable infrastructure. They do it by not building infrastructure at all.",1415927637

A nuclear bomb (such as a fission bomb) can be thought of a bit like a light-bulb, only an extremely bright one that is so hot it shines mainly in the x-ray spectrum. A multi-stage thermonuclear bomb takes the light from a fission bomb and traps it inside of a &quot;hohlraum&quot; which is a fancy german word for a box or chamber that happens to be made out of very heavy metals (often depleted Uranium) that is reasonably opaque to the soft x-rays emitted by the nuclear explosion.<p>Of course, no mere metal container is going to contain the energy of a nuclear explosion for long, the inside surface layers of the hohlraum will absorb some fraction of the x-rays and be vaporized (this is called ablation). This ablation of surface material is so energetic it creates a thrust, like a rocket exhaust coming off the surface of the material it pushes the material away, blowing up the hohlraum like a balloon. The same forces play out on the other occupant of the hohlraum, a capsule containing fusion fuel (often lithium deuteride paste) with a shell made out of similar &quot;high-z&quot; x-ray opaque material. The ablation of the surface of the fusion fuel capsule creates incredible forces, powered as it is by the energy of a nuclear explosion. This causes the fusion fuel capsule to implode, creating conditions of extraordinarily high matter density, pressure, and temperature (due to adiabatic heating). At the center of the fusion fuel capsule there is a fission bomb core, a chunk of Plutonium or Uranium. Because of the speed and strength of the &quot;radiation implosion&quot; (though strictly speaking it&#x27;s a radiation powered ablation implosion) the amount of fissile material can be small compared to a chemically powered implosion design (keeping in mind that critical mass goes down as density goes up). This &quot;spark plug&quot; then kicks off a super critical fission chain reaction which starts releasing energy that heats up the fusion fuel and kicks off a fusion chain reaction. The fusion reaction then releases a metric crap-ton of very high energy neutrons which facilitate fission reactions including fissioning of depleted Uranium (U-238) in the bomb components (such as the hohlraum, the tamper around the fission primary, the fusion fuel capsule casing, etc.)<p>In principle, much is the same. The main difference is that the explosive force to implode the main bomb (or the &quot;secondary&quot;) comes from a nuclear explosion.",1415927525

Perhaps we should make this clearer on the supported stores page.<p>All in due time.

</code></pre>
From the thread, it seems like the concern was just that lxc-exec wasn&#x27;t well maintained and the lxc interfaces weren&#x27;t stable since it was undergoing heavy development. I think that&#x27;s changed recently with both lxc and docker now post 1.0 release and &#x27;production-ready&#x27;.<p>Docker still uses LXC if you want it to via the lxc-exec driver and the --lxc-conf option. It&#x27;s just not the default, which probably makes sense since the lxc options mainly apply for advanced users.<p>So by default, Docker uses libcontainer for a simpler installation experience. But for advanced users, using the lxc driver is an option to look into.<p>IMO, Docker wins if it continues to play nicely with the other open-source projects people use with Docker, and also give credit where due.",1415926948

L’importance d’être seul<p>Quand j’ai finalement pris contact avec le monde mathématique à Paris, un ou deux ans plus tard, j’ai fini par y apprendre, entre beaucoup d’autres choses, que le travail que j’avais fait dans mon coin avec les moyens du bord, était (à peu de choses près) ce qui était bien connu de &quot;tout le monde&quot;, sous le nom de théorie de la mesure et de l’intégrale de Lebesgue&quot;. Aux yeux des deux ou trois aînés à qui j’ai parlé de ce travail (voire même, montré un manuscrit), c’était un peu comme si j’avais simplement perdu mon temps, à refaire du &quot;déjà connu&quot;. Je ne me rappelle pas avoir été déçu, d’ailleurs. A ce moment-là, l’idée de recueillir un &quot;crédit&quot;, ou ne serait-ce qu’une approbation ou simplement l’intérêt d’autrui, pour le travail que je faisais, devait être encore étrangère à mon esprit. Sans compter que mon énergie était bien assez accaparée à me familiariser avec un milieu complètement différent, et surtout, à apprendre ce qui était considéré à Paris comme le B.A.BA du mathématicien2.<p>Pourtant, en repensant maintenant à ces trois années, je me rends compte qu’elles n’étaient nullement gas- pillées. Sans même le savoir, j’ai appris alors dans la solitude ce qui fait l’essentiel du métier de mathématicien - ce qu’aucun maître ne peut véritablement enseigner. Sans avoir eu jamais à me le dire, sans avoir eu a ren- contrer quelqu’un avec qui partager ma soif de comprendre, je savais pourtant, &quot;par mes tripes&quot; je dirais, que j’étais un mathématicien : quelqu’un qui &quot;fait&quot; des maths, au plein sens du terme - comme on &quot;fait&quot; l’amour. La mathématique était devenue pour moi une maîtresse toujours accueillante à mon désir. Ces années de so- litude ont posé le fondement d’une confiance qui n’a jamais été ébranlée - ni par la découverte (débarquant à Paris à l’âge de vingt ans) de toute l’étendue de mon ignorance et de l’immensité de ce qu’il me fallait apprendre : ni (plus de vingt ans plus tard) par les épisodes mouvementés de mon départ sans retour du monde mathématique ; ni, en ces dernières années, par les épisodes souvent assez dingues d’un certain &quot;Enterrement&quot; (anticipé et sans bavures) de ma personne et de mon oeuvre, orchestré par mes plus proches compagnons d’antan. . .<p>Pour le dire autrement : j’ai appris, en ces années cruciales, à être seul3. J’entends par là : aborder par mes propres lumières les choses que je veux connaître, plutôt que de me fier aux idées et aux consensus, exprimés ou tacites, qui me viendraient d’un groupe plus ou moins étendu dont je me sentirais un membre, ou qui pour toute autre raison serait investi pour moi d’autorité. Des consensus muets m’avaient dit, au lycée comme à l’université, qu’il n’y avait pas lieu de se poser de question sur la notion même de &quot;volume&quot;, présentée comme &quot;bien connue&quot;, &quot;évidente&quot;, &quot;sans problème&quot;. J’avais passé outre, comme chose allant de soi - tout comme Lebesgue, quelques décennies plus tôt, avait dû passer outre. C’est dans cet acte de &quot;passer outre&quot;, d’être soi-même en somme et non pas simplement l’expression des consensus qui font loi, de ne pas rester enfermé à l’intérieur du cercle impératif qu’ils nous fixent - c’est avant tout dans cet acte solitaire que se trouve &quot;la création&quot;. Tout le reste vient par surcroît.<p>Par la suite, j’ai eu l’occasion, dans ce monde des mathématiciens qui m’accueillait, de rencontrer bien des gens, aussi bien des aînés que des jeunes gens plus ou moins de mon âge, qui visiblement étaient beaucoup plus brillants, beaucoup plus &quot;doués&quot; que moi. Je les admirais pour la facilité avec laquelle ils apprenaient, comme en se jouant, des notions nouvelles, et jonglaient avec comme s’ils les connaissaient depuis leur berceau - alors que je me sentais lourd et pataud, me frayant un chemin péniblement, comme une taupe, à travers une montagne informe de choses qu’il était important (m’assurait-on) que j’apprenne, et dont je me sentais incapable de saisir les tenants et les aboutissants. En fait, je n’avais rien de l’étudiant brillant, passant haut la main les concours prestigieux, assimilant en un tournemain des programmes prohibitifs.<p>La plupart de mes camarades plus brillants sont d’ailleurs devenus des mathématiciens compétents et ré-

Ils sont restés prisonniers sans le savoir de ces cercles invisibles et impérieux, qui délimitent un Univers dans un milieu et à une époque donnée. Pour les franchir, il aurait fallu qu’ils retrouvent en eux cette capacité qui était leur à leur naissance, tout comme elle était mienne : la capacité d’être seul.<p>Le petit enfant, lui, n’a aucune difficulté à être seul. Il est solitaire par nature, même si la compagnie occasionnelle ne lui déplaît pas et qu’il sait réclamer la totosse de maman, quand c’est l’heure de boire. Et il sait bien, sans avoir eu à se le dire, que la totosse est pour lui, et qu’il sait boire. Mais souvent, nous avons perdu le contact avec cet enfant en nous.

C’est quand, au delà de toutes les différences de culture et de destin, ce que je dis de ma personne et de ma vie trouve en toi écho et résonance ; quand tu y retrouves aussi ta propre vie, ta propre expérience de toi-même, sous un jour peut-être auquel tu n’avais pas accordé attention jusque là. Il ne s’agit pas d’une &quot;identification&quot;, à quelque chose ou à quelqu’un d’éloigné de toi.

8605233,comment,8604814,8604814,0,0,joaorico,,,"Here&#x27;s one of his staggering quotes [1], worth reading through:<p>&quot;In those critical years I learned how to be alone. [But even] this formulation doesn&#x27;t really capture my meaning. I didn&#x27;t, in any literal sense learn to be alone, for the simple reason that this knowledge had never been unlearned during my childhood. It is a basic capacity in all of us from the day of our birth. However these three years of work in isolation [1945–1948], when I was thrown onto my own resources, following guidelines which I myself had spontaneously invented, instilled in me a strong degree of confidence, unassuming yet enduring, in my ability to do mathematics, which owes nothing to any consensus or to the fashions which pass as law....By this I mean to say: to reach out in my own way to the things I wished to learn, rather than relying on the notions of the consensus, overt or tacit, coming from a more or less extended clan of which I found myself a member, or which for any other reason laid claim to be taken as an authority. This silent consensus had informed me, both at the lycée and at the university, that one shouldn&#x27;t bother worrying about what was really meant when using a term like &quot;volume,&quot; which was &quot;obviously self-evident,&quot; &quot;generally known,&quot; &quot;unproblematic,&quot; etc....It is in this gesture of &quot;going beyond,&quot; to be something in oneself rather than the pawn of a consensus, the refusal to stay within a rigid circle that others have drawn around one—it is in this solitary act that one finds true creativity. All others things follow as a matter of course.<p>Since then I&#x27;ve had the chance, in the world of mathematics that bid me welcome, to meet quite a number of people, both among my &quot;elders&quot; and among young people in my general age group, who were much more brilliant, much more &quot;gifted&quot; than I was. I admired the facility with which they picked up, as if at play, new ideas, juggling them as if familiar with them from the cradle—while for myself I felt clumsy, even oafish, wandering painfully up an arduous track, like a dumb ox faced with an amorphous mountain of things that I had to learn (so I was assured), things I felt incapable of understanding the essentials or following through to the end. Indeed, there was little about me that identified the kind of bright student who wins at prestigious competitions or assimilates, almost by sleight of hand, the most forbidding subjects.<p>In fact, most of these comrades who I gauged to be more brilliant than I have gone on to become distinguished mathematicians. Still, from the perspective of thirty or thirty-five years, I can state that their imprint upon the mathematics of our time has not been very profound. They&#x27;ve all done things, often beautiful things, in a context that was already set out before them, which they had no inclination to disturb. Without being aware of it, they&#x27;ve remained prisoners of those invisible and despotic circles which delimit the universe of a certain milieu in a given era. To have broken these bounds they would have had to rediscover in themselves that capability which was their birthright, as it was mine: the capacity to be alone.&quot;<p>[1] Quote translation found in [2] from Alexander Grothendieck, Récoltes et Semailles, 1986, English translation by Roy Lisker, www.grothendieck-circle.org, chapter 2.<p>[2] Smolin, Lee - The Trouble with Physics",1415926875

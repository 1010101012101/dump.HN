Comparing crime between blacks and non-blacks may seem like it&#x27;s useful data, the rates are pretty significantly different. But it&#x27;s not, because the majority of people, white, black, whatever, aren&#x27;t criminals. So if you use that &quot;data&quot; to treat people differently you&#x27;ll be making an error far more often than being right.

It makes far more sense for MS&#x27;s mobile strategy than adding Android compatibility to WP. Instead, encourage devs to create a single .NET app that can be deployed to Android, iOS, and OSX, in addition to first-class support on WP and W8. You&#x27;d lose out on the current hot apps, but for the future it makes sense. For instance, several Nokia X Android apps were ported from their WP counterparts using Xamarin - <a href=""http://blog.xamarin.com/nokia-x-for-csharp/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.xamarin.com/nokia-x-for-csharp/</a> .<p>My only concerns if this were to happen are,<p>* What happens to Mono on Linux, BSD & OSX? Does Mono simply become a deployment target for mobile devices?<p>* What happens to MonoDevelop?  Will VS be the only way to develop such apps?<p>* What about the web? I&#x27;d love to see a Mono port to pNACL or asm.js.

I&#x27;m sure that more than 99% of all software is developed without unit tests. This includes the linux kernel and the rest of the OS, the other big OS-es, databases and other commercial software. Even most of the Java code doesn&#x27;t have detailed unit tests. To base your evaluation entirely on how well the candidate uses those technical seems not very objective to me. I&#x27;ve seen people who are very good at working with very messy code which is impossible to refactor in a reasonable time and they do a very good job without any unit tests. This skill is sometimes much more important than knowing how to run you tests and few refactoring tricks.<p>TDD is a methodology - not an ability.

7420817,comment,7420349,7420539,31,0,muuh-gnu,,,"The main issue with Guile is the same issue as with any other Scheme, and that issue is that it is a Scheme. No single Scheme is widely adopted and the main reason for that is extreme balkanization. You dont write code in Scheme, you write Guile, Racket, Chicken, etc.<p>The Scheme philosophy, which was developed in opposition to batteries-included aka &quot;bloated&quot; Common Lisp, was to have a small core and emphasize simplicity, purity, etc. For years proponents of Scheme have emphasized how beautiful and simple the small standard of 50 pages is, compared with Common Lisps &quot;bloated&quot; 1000+ pages standard.<p>This had two consequences:<p>1. It was extremely easy to write a scheme implementation, soinstead of writing code _in_ scheme, people wrote _schemes_. Hundreds of them. And while other people spent the last 20 years writing thousands of useful libraries in C, python, java, scheme implementors spent reinventing the wheel, over and over and over and over again. Today there are more implementations of scheme than libraries in scheme.<p>2. The emphasis on &quot;small core&quot; might be cute for teaching SICP, but in order to be able to do anything useful with the implementation, it forced the implementors to reinvent the wheels for everything else. And each implementation did it their own way because standardization was considered &quot;selling out&quot; and aping the nemesis Common Lisp. This led to _extreme_ code unportability.<p>Nowadays they are somehow trying to standardize, but with the consequence that they are realizing that by doing that, they are becoming indistinguishable from their old nemesis Common Lisp, which went through the same balkanization phase 20 years ago, so the point of splitting off Scheme from Lisp is becoming questionable. Instead of wasting precious time writing 1001 scheme implementations, they could have spent the last 20 years writing useful common lisp libraries and competing with other batteries-included languages like java and python.<p>In short: Besides the social problems that every Scheme suffers from and the Lisp world suffered during the 80s, Guile on its own is doing quite well. Once it is integrated into Emacs, Emacs will become Guile&#x27;s killer app, boost its popularity and set it apart from other schemes.",1395132378

This should be a 1-year visa, which should just require a few letters of recommendation, qualification in the field (academic degree or equivalent work experience from any country), and function like an OPT.

You vendor all dependencies.</i><p>No, I&#x27;m saying imagine you have an app, which depends on pkgs a and b. a depends on c1.1, b depends on c1.5, but this is documented nowhere in the code because the import statements simply say import &quot;c&quot;. This is the default and encouraged behaviour currently with golang and go get. go get a fetches the latest of c.<p>You then vendor a,b,c and happily compile your app, which doesn&#x27;t work because the version of c you got when you vendored was 2.1, which neither a nor b was written against. Maybe your app will fail to build and you fix it, maybe your app will build but be wrong in subtle ways (say an enum value changed), without explicit versioning you have no idea really.<p>If a and b had a vendored c, you have an even more messy situation as security bugs exist in c1.1 and c1.5, but you don&#x27;t even know which version you have if you pull in the ac and bc and compile against them, or if you can safely use two versions of c at once, your code uses c2.1 too, etc, etc.<p>Being explicit about versions is helpful for resolving dependency conflicts because it makes it explicit which version was expected at the time of writing, it doesn&#x27;t magically solve all conflicts, no-one has this completely worked out, but it helps to be as explicit as possible when including other projects, and it is helpful in keeping up to date libraries whilst easily including them, even if you vendor.<p>If you have a large, open ecosystem of constantly evolving libraries, which I think golang should aspire to, it is useful to version them (just as golang itself is versioned).",1395130663

It was the internet hate machine (on both sides), his employer, and her employer, who took any actions. You can&#x27;t really blame the policy for what happened; as far as I can tell, the conference did everything right, it&#x27;s everyone else who overreacted.<p>> As for threatening language online -- that&#x27;s not being codified as a cultural ideal.<p>I have no idea what you&#x27;re talking about. What are you saying is being &quot;codified as a cultural ideal&quot;? What are you saying isn&#x27;t?<p>> Also, trigger warnings? Really? The amount of coddling of easily bruised egos here is mindboggling.<p>And yet you&#x27;re so afraid that someone might accuse you of mansplaining? I can&#x27;t imagine how you can complain about a thin skin while in the same breath complaining about that term. If your mind boggles at coddling, maybe you should complain about such terms being used as rhetorical baseball bats; because all you&#x27;re really doing there is asking for the same coddling in return.<p>By the way, I had added the trigger warning when I had originally planned on actually including some of the rape and death threats in my post; I then decided against it, and to only mention them, but neglected to remove the warning.<p>> Every race, creed, gender, and nation has members who have seen events that are a burden on the psyche and could &quot;trigger&quot; on any number of imaginable things. You, however, are focused on first world, tech industry, mostly white women.<p>Um, we&#x27;re talking about first world tech industry stuff, among a first world tech industry audience, about topics that are more likely to be sensitive for such an audience as they involve rape and death threats against members of the first world tech industry. I don&#x27;t know why the fact that other groups have other triggers has anything to do with this; it&#x27;s something that&#x27;s generally considered polite to do in these kinds of discussions, as someone following the discussion may be someone fairly directly affected by the topics discussed.<p>The comments I was considering quoting are not things that I would likely repeat in person to a group of people without knowing who was around and listening, as there are some people who are more sensitive to such things than others (I&#x27;ve had a friend faint at a graphic description of a medical procedure before; you never know when someone will be more affected by your words than you had expected). On the internet, you can never know who will be listening, so it&#x27;s polite to provide at least a warning so those people who may be affected can skip over it or prepare themselves if necessary.<p>> This sort of disproportionate nonsense is exactly why I can&#x27;t feel safe or comfortable around your segment of the tech industry.<p>Exactly what makes you feel unsafe? That I&#x27;m trying to show a certain amount of respect for other people? Or that you&#x27;re being asked by the code of conduct to act in a polite and professional manner? I&#x27;m not really sure how that&#x27;s supposed to make you feel unsafe.",1395130539

I don&#x27;t mind Objective-C, but compared to C#/F# (yep F#! Nice!) it&#x27;s not very nice for my taste. Xamarin fixes that with 2 very nice languages and a solidly written small layer on the native API.<p>I have produced apps for iOS and Android with it after having written many native apps for both, so the transition was very easy as you use the same API&#x27;s. You just reuse a lot of non-UI code.<p>Note that I don&#x27;t use visual tools for either platforms; not in Xamarin nor native; all UI is handcoded which, for me, has been proven to be a lot faster indeed. Reuse, refactoring and reasoning with UI code are easy that way while these visual aids don&#x27;t really do anything beyond &quot;Hello World&quot;.<p>QT Creator is nice but when I tried it 6 months ago it was not ready for prime time mobile wise and it is an abstraction over the gui/api meaning it is farther away from the API/device than you would sometimes want.<p>Intel XDK to me was a horrible experience, but after making so many HTML5 mobile / hybrid apps, I learned to hate the process. It&#x27;s not ready; just forget about it for now. Make web stuff (responsive, web apps) in HTML5, make apps in something else.<p>I would suggest learning native (Java/Objective-C) first, getting some good experience with that in, then moving away from the visual tooling like storyboards etc (It&#x27;s a matter of taste but > 100 apps later I would never use it again unless it improves a lot somehow... and I don&#x27;t see that happening) and then maybe use something like Xamarin  if you don&#x27;t like the original native languages or want to reuse a lot of code. A more painful way of reuse which is used in games a lot is to write the common code in C++ and only the UI in the native tech. This is not a nice process at the moment IMHO esp as Android requires you to do that via the NDK and I have had issues with that.",1395130331

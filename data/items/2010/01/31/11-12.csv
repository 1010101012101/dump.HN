1090405,comment,1089092,1089443,0,0,trezor,,,"I have to disagree on this one. Everyone I know with a Xbox 360 has them in their livingroom, hooked up to a big-ass HDTV.<p>Ofcourse you can attribute that to my age, and the fact that I don't know too many teenagers, but for the teens in my family, if they are gamers at all, what they have is a PC in their bedroom. Console-gaming is if not exclusively at least largely a social thing, and thus makes more sense to have in a room made for socializing.<p>While my argument isn't backed by solid data and mostly relies on my own experiences, you can't really claim yours is any better either.<p>As for as the Xbox 360 goes <i>right now</i> it is a massive success. It is one of the top three consoles in a market where there used to only be two. That's big achievement in itself.",1264939127

1090403,comment,1090383,1090383,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"I have a hard time believing that Amazon is not greatly in the wrong here. Perhaps there are details yet to be revealed, but to me it looks very much like Amazon is abusing its power trying to make a point. Regardless of its goals, that's just not kosher. If I go into a bookstore and find that suddenly a huge swath of books have been removed from the shelves due to some retarded corporate back room strategery that will almost certainly be the last time I visit that bookstore. Amazon is treading dangerous ground here in its seeming wanton disrespect for both books and its customers.<p>I hope I am mistaken or that they will remedy the situation in a way that alleviates my concerns but I fear that I may be forced to stop giving Amazon my business in order to maintain a clear conscience.",1264938928

Want to trial someone for a week or two first. (Unpaid) which then may move to part/full time paid.

If you're looking for any kind of work where you can push your skill set and get a good reference, just email me at khuram@xs-pro.co.uk -- we're based in the UK but <i>you</i> can be based <i>anywhere</i> as we're do everything remotely.<p>PS.

Lots of people write raw HTML (in some contexts).<p>But <i>I</i> certainly wouldn't want to write an entire book in HTML - it forces you to type a <i>lot</i> of brackets and tags. I'm sure your editor could take a lot of work off your shoulders, but even at that you end up typing a ton of macros (I would think). In any case, it seems easier to me to type the bulk of it in Markdown (or the like) and only occasionally drop down to raw HTML. To each, his or her own though.",1264937404

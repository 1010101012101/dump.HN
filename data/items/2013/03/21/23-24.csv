5420313,comment,5415585,5417351,2,0,alaskamiller,,,"You're talking about 2011 storylines.<p>There were plenty of discussions about HTML5 vs native mobile apps. Big companies like Google and Facebook extolled HTML5, partly because they needed leverage against Apple's stronghold over the dominate ecosystem. So yes, the decision was a business one to begin with.<p>Then when reality didn't fit their agenda they've all since switched positions in 2012. Facebook rebuilding their iOS app with Obj-C, for example, to be as fast as possible. So then the decision ultimately became a technical one.<p>Maybe it'll flip flopped around soon. We did go through a period in the 90's when CD drives came out and everyone rushed in to deliver as much multimedia content on CDs as possible before that industry died and gave way to the ubiquity of the Internet.<p>In the future, smart phones are the CDs.",1363910385
5420312,comment,5419610,5420011,1,0,14113,,,"I agree that those offering the threats would be to <i>blame</i> but what we were discussing was the <i>cause</i>, who in this case is Adria.<p>Ethics are tricky, and I don't think there are blanket wrong or right answers here. I agree that simply placating a baying mob by tossing someone (metaphorically) to the wolves is not necessarily ethically right from all perspectives, but therein lies the problem: it's about perspective. Were it about a university defending an author from religious nutjobs then it's ethically right for them to support him. However, when it comes to companies, there are certain other perspectives on ethics that need to be taken into account. For example, <i>ethically</i> a company has to do everything it can for it's shareholders. It's legally required to do this, and has an ethical responsibility to. This might be in contrast to yours or my ethics, but for the company the ethical thing to do would be to fire someone who's losing them money.<p>Anyway, like I said, it's tricky. <i>Personally</i> I think SendGrid is justified in firing Adria: as a PR employee her job is to promote the company, which is difficult when the community she's trying to promote the product to has taken umbrage with her. If their sole reason was because of the DDoS attack I think that wouldn't be justified, but given the fiasco it's damaging to their reputation to continue to have her on their staff.<p>As an aside (and to hopefully help explain my viewpoint) in the Dawkins matter: I don't think it would be ethically irresponsible for a <i>publisher</i> to drop him. Publisher's are there to make money, and having that and the lives of employees threatened is a reasonable reason to drop him. I don't think they should drop him, but in my opinion it's ethically reasonable for them to do it. Were it a university, I think they under no circumstance should drop him. The purpose of a university (at least in the UK) is to teach and generate research. By censoring someone at a university you're essentially censoring science and scientific enquiry which holds much greater ethical ramifications than at a publisher.",1363910382

5420309,story,,,2,1,samiur1204,"Ask HN: What can a potential startup founder do living in the US on an H1-B?",,"[Sorry, this is a repost, but I had no responses for the first one]<p>Hey guys,\nI figured HN would be a good place to ask this, as some of you may have encountered similar situations. I've been living in the US since I was 14, and studied Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering at Cooper Union in New York. My mother was a diplomat, and until I got a job, I was staying in the US through her with the A1 visa. Once I got my job at Amazon, I switched over to an H1B visa, and have been on that since.<p>I've also been working on my startup idea with a few others for the past 7-8 months, and we're getting to the point that we will soon be pitching investors for funding. I've been working on this for most of my available free time, but I really think it's shaping up, and would love to quit and concentrate on it full-time. And even if that's not possible, if somehow we're able to make this happen while I'm working full-time at the job that allows me to stay in the US legally, I'd certainly want to stop working my job and concentrate on making my startup succeed. However, I'm not aware of any options for an immigrant to legally reside in the US without an employer sponsoring him for the H1B (unless I get married of course, but I'd rather not explore that route right now ;D). And since I'd be a stakeholder in the company, I don't think I can sponsor myself.<p>Do you have any advice for my situation? I'd be incredibly bummed if I had to give up my baby to foster care.",1363910332

But there remains one other thing. To build wealth, you'll have to keep your money somewhere. That somewhere is going to be some form of investment. Hence, to build wealth, you must make more on your investments than you lose. Now ask yourself: had I kept my money under the mattress instead of investing it, would I have more now, or would I have less? How much more or less? Funny thing is, most people don't know.

5420303,comment,5419915,5419915,43,0,Lazare,,,"Good to hear.  I have quite a lot of respect for Kerr; he's one of the foremost experts in this area (the intersection of the 4th ammendment with computers and networks), and I think Weev's case is a serious injustice.<p>As an aside, I actually think it's clear that Weev's case is a vastly larger injustice than Aaron Swartz's case.<p>Swartz clearly violated the law in an act of willing and knowing civil disobedience.  The law restricts people from unauthorized access to a network; Swartz and the MIT network admins played a game of cat and mouse as they kept banning him, and he kept finding new ways of gaining access to the network.  There's no way to argue Swartz didn't realize that he was gaining unauthorized access to a network.  At one point he was hiding his face from security cameras; there's no way to spin that as ""oh, he thought he was doing something perfectly allowable!""  And once caught, he was offered a reasonable plea deal.<p>In contrast, Weev...fairly clearly did <i>not</i> gain unauthorized access to a network.  It was a publicly available website, and no one ever tried to stop him.  His actions were at worse borderline, and yet he ended up with a sentence MUCH higher than Swartz.<p>I have a lot of sympathy for Swartz (not least because of his tragic suicide), but at the end of the day he knowingly and wilfully violated the law in an act of civil disobedience, and was offered a plea deal of less than a year.  Weev probably did not violate the law, and was sentenced to years in prison.<p>Weev needs and deserves help.  I had to cheer a bit when I saw Kerr was going to be helping him.",1363910296

But in public, I think it's different.  You don't know the people who will hear the joke, and you don't know they'll be comfortable with sexual references being made.  A lot of people still associate sexuality with a male/female power imbalance; to force your joke on them -- which is exactly what you're doing when you say it loudly -- echoes that imbalance.  If you give yourself permission, as a man, to behave in a manner that is insensitive and disrespectful to women, that reflects a certain sense of male privilege -- and that's sexist.<p>To his credit, the guy was remorseful once confronted.

Who knows what the true figure is. As your female friends, or indeed, if you are female, have you yourself been assaulted? Now, imagine for a moment sitting in a conference, which is a <i>known space</i> where all kinds of offensive remarks and behaviour toward women occur, which <i>absolutely</i> puts women off going to conferences, or speaking at them. Then the guys next to you make jokes which are sexist, provocative... Potentially nasty... With absolutely no awareness or maturity. Nothing in them thinks 'Well maybe some of the women who are sitting around me might not just be offended by my sexist banter, but might actively be reminded of awful examples of trust abuse'. Of course not! Why would any guy think that? I mean come on, deal with it women, if you have issues! You can listen to us talking about women in an offensive way in public, surely?

With the benefit of hindsight, she should have reported the inappropriate behavior to the conference staff more discretely.  Or, even, turned around and told them to show some respect.  (And, if they didn't cut the crap, THEN get them kicked from the conference.)<p>I don't believe that what she did was inappropriate/unacceptable in any kind of moral sense, and I would gladly hire Adria if I was hiring for that kind of role.  If a person is making jokes with sexual innuendoes during a talk, they shouldn't be at that conference, and shouldn't be surprised that there are consequences, no matter <i>how</i> many kids they have.  Behavior in public is <i>already</i> public; putting it on the internet may make it more so, but it's not as if they had any expectation of privacy in the first place.<p>At the root, I'm glad she stuck up for herself <i>somehow</i>, rather than just kept quiet.  She did so in a clumsy way, and has been castigated for it far more harshly than is useful.<p>Furthermore, this is a clear incident of sexism in our community.  If I had done the exact same thing, there's no way that /r/mensrights would DDoS Joyent into firing me.  This is why women feel unsafe and mistreated in our communities: <i>because they are.</i>  If they stick up for themselves, they're going to face an onslaught of trolling, and even the ostensible ""good guys"" are quick to point out that yes, yes, we don't condone this sort of thing, but come on, She Was Asking For It.<p>As I said, her reaction was a tactical misstep.  At a higher level, there's a strategic point about preventing these sorts of things from happening in the first place.  How do we ensure that the next Adria feels empowered enough to tell the boys behind her to cut it out, where they realize their inappropriateness for the environment and apologize and the world moves on with dignity?

Sexually exclusive language is the starting point for harassment and assault that have been the status quo for the tech industry for decades. (tech isn't alone here, of course)<p>A woman trying to report these offenses often went completely unheard. The crimes were completely silenced by a community that protected itself with homogeny, and the results are strikingly obvious in the number of women working, participating, and attending conferences in technology.<p>This deeply-rooted problem is finally beginning to surface, and we're starting to talk about solutions in a productive way. PyCon was at the forefront of that as they worked incredibly hard to make women feel accepted. Their no-harassment policy and work to get more women speaking and attending represent a huge amount of progress.<p>It has been a very public effort by the conference, and the results were impressive. A huge number of women showed up to a space they thought would be more welcoming.<p>Of course, it wasn't perfect. Though we've made a lot of progress, there's still a long way to go before we'll get rid of exclusive attitudes towards women.<p>What's really disappointing, though, is that when a woman at this conference felt uncomfortable and made her discomfort public, she lost her job.<p>Her peers, our technology community, responded to her statement with incredible hostility. Threats of rape and murder were abundant yesterday, and we attacked a woman for expressing her discomfort publicly.<p>Some people, like yourself, said that it would be okay for her to express her discomfort privately, but that the publicity is what made it a problem. But in doing so, you're asking her to give up her voice. You're asking her to stay silent about an incredibly serious problem.<p>All she did was report factual discomfort publicly. She didn't lie or slander.<p>And now she's lost her job for it. The message is obvious: women aren't allowed to report misconduct like this. We don't want to hear about the sexual misconduct in our community. A woman's discomfort is her own problem, not ours.<p>That's the wrong message.",1363908489

And the buyer of the physical medium had after that property of a thing, and could do what he wanted ( in reasonable limits). Most importantly, as long as CDs were copied by cassettes, the buyer could supply his friends with low quality copies.<p>So it seems to me, that the entire idea of intellectual property revolved around the inability of most people to produce a high quality copy of the medium. In contrast, nowadays everybody could easily produce and distribute a high quality copy. So I think that with the internet the physical medium vanished and with it the part of an immaterial good which made it possible to speak about 'ownership' and 'property' in the first place. So it is certainly the case that we need a consensus, what reasonable behaviour of creators and consumers is. But I think that talk about 'ownership' is just muddinging the water. And personally I find it quite frustrating that we have all these fascinating technology which create abundance of all digitial works. And we are not allowed to actually use them, because we can not figure out how to pay creators (which has not necessarily anything to do with copying in the first place).",1363908226

They aren't as good at second amendment litigation (although they've been successful in litigating against bad gun laws using other constitutional amendments as well as the state constitutions -- which usually have stronger provisions for the right to bear arms than the US constitution).<p>EFF and ACLU, on the other hand, work through litigation. They are not nearly as well funded. NRA is not just a political organization, they are also effectively a AAA for firearm owners: they provide safety training (they're famous for having coined the ""3 rules of gun safety""), sell targets, provide discounts on everything from wine to hotels, etc...<p>As much as it hurts for me to say, most people don't care about civil liberties. They want civil liberties <i>for them</i>: they want to carry a gun, they want to be able choose when to have or not to have a child, etc... Yet when it comes to more core liberties -- and despite being a strong 2A supporter and a gun owner, I think 1A and 4A are far more crucial than 2A <i>today</i> -- there's very little personal motive. People are very willing to give away their privacy to receive a discount at Safeway:<p><a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2010/02/23/judge-alex-kozinski-the-fourth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/blog/2010/02/23/judge-alex-kozinski-the-fo...</a><p>Is there a silver lining? Actually, yes! I think the rise of Internet will make privacy a more paramount concern that everyone will take to heart. Consider, for example this email subject from ACLU (about CISSPA) that I received and that literally (and likely deliberately and by design) made me quickly jump out of my seat:<p><pre><code>  68359   + Mar 06 Anthony D. Rome ( 270) Your last Amazon.com order\n</code></pre>\nIn short, people who are _not_ civil libertarians (unlike myself, who is an ACLU and EFF member -- along with a donor to NRA-ILA and SAF) need a personal stake in core civil liberties in order to care about them. Fortunately, the Internet will give them just that stake.",1363908105

Nobody in Spain thinks that chairs are 'where women belong' or anything like that.",1363907673

I do agree there could be a causal link: Dawkins's university or publisher might receive threats as a result of his atheist advocacy. But who is really to <i>blame</i> for these threats? I would argue it is the people who would make threats in response to atheist advocacy who are to blame, and all effort should be put towards shutting such people down.<p>And does it mean I would support, as an ethical matter, Dawkins's publisher or university choosing to drop him, on the grounds that he has caused them difficulties, and they are therefore right in firing him to solve them? Obviously not: I would blame those making threats, and would consider his publisher and university spineless cowards if they dropped him as an author or fired him as an employee in response to the threats. I would expect them, rather, to expend their efforts tracking down the people who made the threats.",1363907670

In other words, how does one qualify that lawyers are less hurt by language that berates them vs language which damages women, on an individual level.<p>>about whether someone might assault or sexually harass them soon.<p>I think that's a big leap. This line of argument could be used to sweep up the loiters and homeless people who act like they might attack someone due to their language and behavior.<p>> We already have a problem with women feeling excluded and unwelcome<p>I think the best way to approach that is to start young.  In school, drive students of either sex to the possibilities in technology.  This will make the eventual males in tech familiar and receptive to eventual women in tech.  they should both feel they're both a natural fit, given their disposition.<p>>Making sex jokes at a tech conference can encourage the objectifying idea that women are there for their sex appeal<p>I don't agree.  The jokes are not the objectifiers.  It's the people, both the doers and the receivers.  They both have to agree that jokes in question are a manner of objectification for that to have effect.<p>If you told a lawyer joke in an audience of drug dealers, there is little effect.  If it's told by someone who hates lawyers, it takes significance, in American law.  A lawyer joke among an audience of Chinese lawyers might fall flat.<p>>Following a code of conduct that you'd previously agreed to follow seems exactly like what living in a society is to me.<p>I agree there are basic parameters, but I feel that some people will always be more crude than others and I'm not comfortable saying crudeness is categorically unacceptable.",1363906931

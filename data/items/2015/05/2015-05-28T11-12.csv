9617444,comment,9616101,9616101,0,0,sharmi,,,"Hi, I am the author here.  I am kind of overwhelmed that my post got onto HN and there are so many comments :)<p>This post was not meant to be a comprehensive social commentary.  The post was triggered in response to a question from one of my friends at a local meetup on how to improve the gender imbalance.  So the post tended to be more in tune with how to address that particular issue.<p>This post is also not meant to decry or judge the women who voice out their opinions and experiences at work.  It takes a lot of courage to talk about sexism at work as it can potentially affect the relationships with colleagues and also their future employment. Besides, it is impossible for me judge something based on just news reports.<p>Women in India too have issues to tackle.  The disproportional work for women at home in general which affects their participation outside.  The inability to take off from work post-pregnancy for more than the prescribed period even if she wanted to. Cultural restrictions on what a woman can do or cannot do.  These need to be addressed. But I believe these are more social issues than issues in tech.  I respect the women who speak out regarding these and the men who acknowledge and support them. Without them progress would not be made.<p>Unfortunately the proportion of the polarity of reports turn out to be more like product reviews.  Say 10% of negative issues are reported. Not even 0.1% of the positive aspects are reported. (I am pulling numbers from the air, but I hope you get the picture ;) )  Thats because, when things go right, we often fail to notice.  This often results in a skewed negative image. I have mostly been surrounded by men (father, brother, hubby, friends, colleagues, professors, teachers) who were most supportive of what I did and I believe they deserve credit too.  Also, there must more such men and women out there in tech, who can/do inspire more girls into this interesting field.  I believe as individuals, we can make a difference.<p>Also, again, my experience is not definitive. Others might have had a different experience.",1432814113

Since that time I&#x27;ve never seen any 64-core boards or eLink interconnected 16-core clusters for sale.<p>As far as major promises did the Parallella campaign NOT live up to (excluding the 64-core version), as far as I know it&#x27;s still possible to connect multiple Parallella boards together using the Epiphany eLink interfaces. That novel interconnect was to me a key feature of the Epiphany architecture.  Without it interfacing multiple Parallella boards together is forced to go through the Ethernet provided by the Zynq... which (assuming the eLink architecture performs as well as is claimed) is impediment & disappointment.<p>Without fully exploiting the eLink interconnect I think it&#x27;s really difficult to get a full and accurate understanding of the capabilities and weaknesses of the Epiphany architecture.<p>Please don&#x27;t take this in a personal or highly negative way.

When lines are too long, it becomes taxing to move your eyes from the end of one to the start of the next. We read more efficiently when text is arranged in a single column rather than multiple columns or sections. The font, color, and size of text can all act in tandem to make our reading experience easier or more difficult. And while these variables surely exist on paper just as they do on-screen, the range of formats and layouts online is far greater than it is in print. Online, you can find yourself transitioning to entirely new layouts from moment to moment, and, each time you do so, your eyes and your reading approach need to adjust. Each adjustment, in turn, takes mental and physical energy.&quot;</i><p>Huh, I never thought of considering changing typography a context switch[0], but it makes perfect sense.

590548,comment,589709,589709,0,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"We all* know about bars/clubs/etc. that went from being THE place on X night to closing up in a matter of three or four years.  The local paper (Cleveland) featured an interview with a club owner who was closing up a location that, only three years earlier, was a favorite spot of LeBron James and was packed several nights a week.  Instead of complaining about his change in fortune, he proposed that this is the natural cycle of the club scene.  As places get more popular, they become less exclusive and convey less social status on their patrons. So, those people with the most social status are courted elsewhere, and the masses again follow.  The cycle repeats.<p>Freakonomics noted that baby names are usually introduced by wealthier folks and later adopted by poorer people. At that point, they are shunned by the wealthy.<p>Is there a reason that social networking sites should not exhibit similar patterns?  Quite a few articles have been written about how the cool kids went to FB first.  Are we simply witnessing the expected?<p>* Even if you hate going to these places, you probably are still aware of them.",1241325987

I'm not saying it isn't true...but, do a ""lot of people"" really feel that way about Yahoo?  I may have missed the nerd bulletin that went out saying I'm not supposed to trust them.  All the people I know at Yahoo are good folks (likewise all the people I know at Google).<p>That's not to say there aren't troubling events in both companies histories...but I'm not really thinking people actively mistrust Yahoo.

590546,comment,590374,590538,0,0,xenophanes,,,"No one has any anecdote which disproves ""all gender role is social"". For example, parents saying they didn't treat their opposite-gender kids different is useless. They did treat the kids different: different names, different clothes, and many other things. What they really mean is they didn't treat the kids different in any <i>relevant</i> way. But how do they know that? Now they are making a philosophical and non-evidence-based claim. Hardly a courter example.",1241325892

However, this project looks way better, since it allows you evaluate C expressions and statements, and not just top-level definitions.<p>C makes of an awful interactive language. S-Lang looks like a cleaned up C, but still, nothing that comes close to a full expression language with good introspection and reflection capabilities to make a repl sing.",1241325524

590540,comment,590460,590460,0,0,spoondan,,,"Focus on being efficient rather than quick. Charging off in the wrong direction will slow you down. Paralyzing yourself by over-complicating decisions will slow you down. <i>Move forward at a steady rate and you will get things done faster.</i><p>Of course, there is an element of experience and practice. To mitigate this, select good tools and <i>learn them well</i>. You should not need to consult php.net because you should have an editor that provides inline help. You should not frequently need Google because you should have a smattering of algorithms and idioms that can be re-applied. (For example, a large class of text validation and processing problems can be solved trivially with regular expressions.) ""Recipe"" style books can assist in developing go-to approaches for common classes of problems. Knowing the important bits of the standard library will help you avoid writing unnecessary code.<p>Last, but not least, avoid writing code that you don't need right now. This can be big stuff like features you haven't thought through very well. Or it can be small stuff. For example, there's an unfortunate tendency for people trying to do object-oriented programming to define getters and setters for everything. There's no reason to do this (in fact, there are plenty of reasons to not do this, but that's for another discussion) and these little wastes of time start to add up fast.",1241325403

590538,comment,590374,590476,0,0,jerf,,,"A lot of people have the wrong idea about anecdotal evidence. There's the people who thinks it substitutes for proof... but there's also the people who think it's worthless.<p><i>Both</i> are wrong.<p>A universal claim can be disproven with a single counterexample. A nearly universal claim like ""Almost all gender role is social"" can be disproven with nearly a single counterexample. (Or, if you want to get technical, rendered so improbably as to no longer be worth considering.)<p>I don't need to convince myself. I never bought into the transparently-false idea in the first place. Having kids just made it more transparently false.<p>Don't buy into the ""anecdotes aren't data"" line so hard that you go around living life with your eyes closed. That's no more rational than ignoring science entirely.",1241325193
590537,comment,590479,590479,0,0,makecheck,,,"The best way to design an error message is to figure out why you need it in the first place, and eliminate that ""need"" (i.e. you don't display any message).  If the proverbial house isn't burning down, the user doesn't need to know. Most messages can be non-modal, tucked away in a conspicuous spot but not immediately stopping whatever the user is doing.  Even <i>those</i> can often close themselves, not requiring acknowledgment, ever.<p>Somewhere along the line, people forgot that computers are supposed to be tools, and decided it was okay to put up with constant interruptions to their work.

Presumably mapping the problem on to the various existing bits of hardware in the brain.<p>If this is true multiple lecture streams would seem best.

590524,comment,590329,590329,0,0,Sidnicious,,,"I would go with Tomato unless you want customizability.<p>Last time I checked, DD-WRT was just a set of packages on top of OpenWRT, so going with straight OpenWRT lets you add only the functionality you need and customize everything to your heart's content. I would choose that route over DD-WRT. However, I did run into some reliability issues, (wireless connections would drop spontaneously every few weeks) which show up in DD-WRT as well. In OpenWRT, many basic settings (all settings unless you install a web interface) are only accessible via config files. That can get tiring.<p>Tomato is rock-solid and dead-easy to configure, but startlingly light on functionality compared to *WRT.<p>If you have the time, try them both!",1241324197

Up until then you'll get faster, look stuff up less, and churn out code faster.<p>Unrelated to that is the domain-specific knowledge, which has a different effect - you don't get faster, you learn what code to write, and more importantly, what code not to write. In the long run, it probably has more effect on productivity than being comfortable with a language. How long this takes really depends on the domain.<p>My experience with 10x programmers (I don't count myself in that group) is that it's the second area where the big productivity gains lie.",1241324167

No one cares.

Tinkering together hardware is one small part of robotics, but even if you're interested mainly in other aspects you are forced into it.<p>I'm very interested in the autonomy and programming aspects of robotics rather than in soldering. A ready-to-roll platform that allows me to write my own code is <i>exactly</i> what I want. I've learned enough to design and build my own robot (motor drivers and the rest of it) and have done so, and I realize that this part is something I could hand over to pretty much anyone with an EE degree, or better yet just buy the hardware platform pre-assembled. I can do it but I'd rather not, because this isn't where I personally can do anything truly interesting.<p>There's room for hardware tinkerers and software people, and people in between.

""x = 10"" in Ruby creates a local variable. By default, ""$x = 10"" in Perl is creating a global package variable which, in most day to day cases, isn't particularly desirable.<p>Perl's ""my"" really patches over a dangerous default. Perl gives you the global by default. Ruby gives you a local by default. I'd much rather have my defaults be sane than be forced to make declarations to fix things up. Which is why Ruby became my primary language after 8 years of Perl..",1318084017

3087945,comment,3087461,3087461,1,0,sandroyong,,,"Social or social network simply means individuals tied by one or more specific types of interdependencies (ie, friendships, common interests, groups etc).  At its basic element, such online networks are repositories of who I know and this is what I want them to know about me.  But as a network for socializing, does the average user use these networks to really socialize?  Yes (and no), but at the very minimum, it generally entails posting updates on ones life, sharing family/vacation photos, making announcements, all with the intention that the friends/people that we have allowed to share this information will click on your bookpage to read about it (note: strangers can visit but not share some info).<p>This is a one-way socialization process.  So are (technical/introvert) people who are not sociable in real life (as you put it) less qualified to produce a social network than their counterparts?  Alternatively, you could argue that the people that actively use such social networks are vain, narcissist, an with an underlying desire to measure their self-worth by the number of friends they have (this is stretching it a little, so no disrespect to those who actively use such social networks).  So, the techies/introverts may merely be cautious about posting their info online; it does not entirely disqualify them from making social apps.<p>As I see it, the medium of social networking should be less one-way socialization and more like being in the same room with all these people.  Facebook, for example, seems more like a room full of people who walk around with a whiteboard obscuring their faces and posting all of their personal info on these whiteboards, ie, we really dont know if they are who they say they are.  Google+ is no more different  it is the same room, minus the whiteboards (because youve invited friends to join your circle and, thus, share your info).  However, the Google+ room is filled specific/private circles, ie, the cool/popular kids circle, the nerdy/geeky kids circle, the rebellious kids circle  to use a high school analogy =).<p>I think there are two arguments here: 1) current online social mediums are not conducive to traditional (two-way) socializing and 2) given a medium that supports two-way socializing, everyone can and will be sociable.",1318082942

Take this post with a pinch of salt.<p>It's trendy to pick holes at Ruby in various, inaccurate ways lately, but a quote from Matz about that POLS business:<p><i>Everyone has an individual background. Someone may come from Python, someone else may come from Perl, and they may be surprised by different aspects of the language. Then they come up to me and say, ""I was surprised by this feature of the language, so therefore Ruby violates the principle of least surprise."" Wait. Wait. The principle of least surprise is not for you only. The principle of least surprise means principle of least my surprise. And it means the principle of least surprise after you learn Ruby very well. For example, I was a C++ programmer before I started designing Ruby. I programmed in C++ exclusively for two or three years. And after two years of C++ programming, it still surprised me.</i><p>You can pick up almost any programming language, not learn it properly, and then pick holes in its various inconsistencies or flaws (my own is over Python's ambiguities over methods vs functions for various things - but I know I'm not a Python developer!) That doesn't make it interesting or insightful. Every language has dark corners and Matz has been more than forthcoming about Ruby's.<p>This article has numerous curious assumptions and sloppy practices. Local variables called the same as method names? And very few Rubyists, in my experience, would be confused by the key example in the memoization section. Who really thinks || checks for whether a variable is bound rather than doing a logical or? How is it a ""what's worse"" that instance_eval changes <i>self</i> to instance_eval's receiver? That's its entire reason for existing! The second example under ""Local Variables Strike Yet Again"" is flat out wrong, even by the author's own admission..

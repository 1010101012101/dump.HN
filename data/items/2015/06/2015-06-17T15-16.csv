9732710,comment,9729971,9729971,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"Interesting enough, Tcl was one of the past&#x27;s most versatile tools. We used it in agent-oriented programming in 90&#x27;s where code could move from place to place to cut data bill. Sandboxes were built for it. Tcl was also used in AOLserver and a related web framework before that became a fad. So, the author&#x27;s point that Tcl is an <i>option</i> for high-performance event driven apps was proven when the highest traffic site in the world ran on it. I think we have something better today in about every area due to inherent properties of Tcl and labor invested in other solutions. Yet, Tcl delivered plenty in the past, apparently still can, and has potential for people using that sort of thing.<p>The main potential, though, is portability and future-proofing. Tcl is so ridiculously simple that it&#x27;s been implemented on about every OS and architecture. That&#x27;s batteries included due to all the existing code and ActiveState&#x27;s development tools. People can extend live apps, run shell scripts, configure networks, and so on all using the same (or a similar) language. Any change in underlying platform just requires porting the (simple) lower layers. Makes Tcl a powerful future-proofing option if used judiciously.",1434556488

Using Clojure (and watching Rich Hickey&#x27;s amazing talks) made me a much better developer, and especially a better JS developer.<p>Somewhat relatedly, one thing I personally like about CoffeeScript is that it really lets the functional, Lisp-y side of Javascript shine through by melting away all the crufty syntax.

Drivers are consensually agreeing to drive because the pay they receive values their time.<p>People undervalue their labor in order to get the gigs they need to make money. Laborers consensually agreed to unsafe, 18 hour factory work back in the day, and indentured servants consensually agreed to years-long contracts of, effectively, their life.<p>If the only reason uber competes is due to price difference gained by eschewing labor laws and benefits, then of course drivers are agreeing to drive with them -- there is no other option for their labor when the competitors that provide benefits have to shrink operations due to demand shifting to illegally-sourced labor. That said, I don&#x27;t think Uber is used due to their price so much as their technology.<p>>How are they not equipped?<p>I doubt many will afford commercial vehicle insurance, health insurance, 401Ks, in addition to substantially increased maintenance costs covered out of their own pocket. It will certainly make driving for uber undesirable. Of course, Uber covering these costs is far cheaper overall, and the price change would likely be negligible.<p>>What society needs is less people forcing them to do what others think is best.<p>This is just a stupid talking point.",1434556296

The world of Machiavellian Realpolitik is much more nuanced and complex than that, and I mostly chalk it up to our tendency as humans seek to simplify things.<p>First, I would like to point out that I consider Hanlon&#x27;s razor a logical fallacy that should be relegated to the dustbin of debate. It is far too often used in the discussion of this matter.<p>Now to your original question of who &quot;they&quot; is. In short, my conclusion is that it is primarily but not restricted to the supranational aristocratic elite, in particular the ones who desire global governance (at least on the surface). The most obvious example of this is the kinds of people who are C-level or board level who have positions across the world. A good primary jumping point for this would be the analysis of control networks in this very good paper: <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.5728.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.5728.pdf</a><p>All that paper does though is show the level of interconnectedness, but what it doesn&#x27;t show is intent. That wasn&#x27;t your question though and is best left for another discussion.<p>The bottom line to me is that &quot;they&quot; is the uber-wealthy, and that class-warfare and return of a type of neo-feudalism is right around the corner if not already here.<p>If you want to know where the collusion happens, look to the round table groups; eg. the council on foreign relations, the bilderberg group, the trilateral commision, and various think-tanks, superpacs, and tax-exempt foundations, and yes, even secret societies. The main mistake though is to think they are all in on it or even understand it. That&#x27;s not how control at a high level works.<p>Imagine how control of a secretive org such as the CIA/NSA works. It&#x27;s so wrapped up in compartmentalization that it&#x27;s easy to take people who mean well and task them with something they don&#x27;t understand the bigger picture implications of, and combine many of them to accomplish a big thing that none of them understand but a few key people at the top.<p>I propose that the majority of &quot;the key people at the top&quot; are comprimised in some form or fashion, so even they are pawns in a game they don&#x27;t fully understand... many simply want to make money or protect their reputations, though some are most definitely being blackmailed or threatened with much, much worse.",1434555900

Although we are a marketplace, and we align with the on demand economy, the uber reference doesn&#x27;t necessarily fit since it assumes the supply (drivers) are all created equal. With UpCounsel our supply (lawyers) are carefully curated, and we match you with a set of lawyers who meet your specific needs. Similar to uber, our lawyers must maintain a high rating while on the platform. Unlike Uber, once you find a lawyer who meets your needs you can continue to work with them on the platform, easily and on-going. Please email me with any questions, or if we can help you with your legal needs. My email is brad [at] UpCounsel.com",1434555469

unique feature of monadic errors: in Java, you are required to explicitly list
exceptions that a function can throw (checked exceptions), and you must handle
every exception when calling the function.<p>The real feature of monadic error handling is that error handling become
<i>composable</i>.<p>Imagine that you want to write a function that accepts three character-encoded
integers and that you want this function to return the first integer it
successfully parsed.<p>With exceptions, you will probably use a <i>parseInt</i> function with a type similar
to:<p><pre><code>    fun parseInt(String) -> Int throws ParseException
</code></pre>
And you will write the function like this:<p><pre><code>    fun getFirstInt(String a, String b, String c) -> Int throws ParseException:
        try: 
            return parseInt(a)
        catch e1:
            try:
                return parseInt(b)
            catch e2:
                return parseInt(c)
</code></pre>
Now take a language supports algebric data types (like Haskell, Rust, Scala or
OCaml). The <i>parseInt</i> function will probably have a type similar to:<p><pre><code>    fun parseInt(String) -> Result<Int, ParseException>
</code></pre>
You will probably define a simple operator to manage the pattern <i>if it fails,
try that instead</i> before implementing the <i>getFirstInt</i> function. Lets call this
operator <i><|></i> (it&#x27;s its name in Haskell):<p><pre><code>    fun operator <|>(Result<r, e> left, Result<r, e> right) -> Result<r, e>:
        match left:
            Ok(r)    -> return Ok(r)
            Error(e) -> return right
</code></pre>
With this operator, <i>getFirstInt</i> could be implemented as simply as<p><pre><code>    fun getFirstInt(String a, String b, String c) -> Result<Int, ParseException>:
        return parseInt(a) <|> parseInt(b) <|> parseInt(c)
 </code></pre>
I think that the fact that you can write you own error handling operator is the
killer feature of monadic error handling (and monadic programming in general).
It makes the enforced handling of errors really painless (while it&#x27;s like hell
in Java where every exception must be handled).<p>It&#x27;s almost impossible to create this kind of operators with exceptions because
they are not a return value, and thus can&#x27;t be handled in expression. With
monadic error, handling operators are just plain old functions.",1434554875

And not just as something to live with, but something to (eventually) <i>cherish</i> (for intermediate coders, this manifests itself in the realization that dynamic languages pay a price for their flexibility over statically-typed languages).<p>Is it a pain in the ass that missing a closing quotation mark will cause your program to outright crash, at best, or silently and inexplicably carry on, at worst? Sure. But it&#x27;s not <i>illogical</i>. Computers are dumb. The explicitness of code is the compromise we humans make to translate our intellectual desire to deterministic, wide-scale operations. It cannot be overemphasized how dumb computers are, especially if you&#x27;re going to be dealing with them at the programmatic level...and this is an inextricable facet of working with them. It&#x27;s also an <i>advantage</i>...predictable and deterministic is better than fuzziness, when it comes down to doing things exactly right, in an automated fashion.<p>I think grokking the exactness of code will provide insight to the human condition. While using the wrong word in a program will cause it to fail...we perceive human communication as being much more forgiving with not-quite-right phrasing and word choices? But is that true? How do you know, really? How many times have you done something, like forget to say &quot;Please&quot;, and the other person silently regards you as an asshole...and your perception is that the transaction went just fine? Or what if you <i>say</i> the right thing but your body (or attire) says another? Fuzziness in human communication is fun and exciting, but I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s ultimately more <i>forgiving</i> than human-to-computer communication. At least with the latter, you have a chance to audit it at the most granular level...and this ability to <i>debug</i> is also inherent to the practice of coding, and a direct consequence of the structure of programming languages.",1434554626

No more banning 2-door cars or 11 year old cars, no more banning tips, no more auto-filtering out all less than perfect records, drivers would have to negotiate fares not uber, no more background checks.  Basically uber does a traditional hiring process without actually hiring, whereas they&#x27;d have to move to a traditional contracting relationship.  Uber forbids contracting relationships in their ToS, its specifically forbidden to hire a subcontractor.  Clauses like that really set off labor boards and the IRS about &quot;fake&quot; contracting.<p>Specifically, uber would have to let the end user decide not to accept a ride in my new 2-door Yaris or my wife&#x27;s 2004 Prius rather than denying for me.  Also if riders consistently give me 1 star because of my HN posting habits or whatever, they&#x27;d have to let the riders decide to not accept me rather than autofiltering out all sub 4.6 or whatever grade-inflated score they use.  They couldn&#x27;t run a background check on me to join the service, MAYBE they could get away with running it and putting the result semi-anonymously online for the rider to make a judgement.  They would have to let me set the minimum fare I&#x27;d demand, which actually sounds pretty nice for drivers rather than existing &quot;yes/no&quot; take it or leave it, and tips would have to be permitted.<p>Possibly they could spawn off a &quot;union&quot; or professional organization that only allows members to join that passed a background check and then only allow members to advertise themselves as part of the union.  Like my roofing contractor or my unionized electrician.<p>There&#x27;s a widely held belief, that is completely wrong, that a contractor is just an employee who is treated like dirt in exchange for more money than an employee gets; essentially a gambling relationship.

I had a big problem with the C# type system/management. I&#x27;d been reading guides that were in the first category the author mentions, eg. &quot;not really a beginner, but new to this language&quot;.<p>I was trying to retrieve the bytes that a certain string represented. I was looking for ages and everywhere everyone mentioned that &quot;this shouldn&#x27;t be done&quot;, &quot;just use the string&quot;, etc. A stack overflow answer mentions a way to use an &#x27;encoding&#x27; to get the bytes and this seemed to be the only way.<p>How strange I thought, I just want access to a pointer to that value, why do I have to jump through all these hoops. None of the guides I was reading provided an answer, until I found a _real_ beginners book. This book, helpfully starting at the real beginning of every language: the type system, finally gave me the answer I was looking for:<p>.net stores/handles all strings by encoding them with a default encoding. It turned out that the whole notion of &#x27;strings are only bytes&#x27; that I carried over from C++ does not work in C#. All those other helpful guides gleefully glossed over this, and started right in at lambdas and integration with various core libraries. Instead of focusing at the basics first.",1434553422

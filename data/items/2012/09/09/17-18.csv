People downloading music can be an indication of opportunism as much as of market failure.<p>Think about how much smaller the music industry would be, and I'm just talking about the number of people making music themselves, if there were no sales of recordings. No more buying a CD on your way out of a local or touring band's show, no more iTunes Music Store or Amazon MP3 or CD store, no more labels; you're talking about taking away a majority of these artists' revenue. If musicians can't ever hope to get paid enough to put food on their table and a roof over their head, how many will put in the energy needed to bring their music to fruition? How many will put in the effort to make good recordings for you to enjoy? Making a good recording is difficult and expensive, and we benefit greatly from it. There is value there for us that we should have the courtesy of recognizing if we hope to enjoy a wide selection good music recordings in the future.",1347213525

Someone found him on the registry, and he was subsequently banned from several organizations he was previously considered a valuable member of. By this time he was in his late 20s and talking to some of the shriller voices against them, I realized they didn't understand the difference between something he did at 19 and something he wouldn't do at 28. They just assumed he was after their 13 year old daughters and nothing else. Ruined a lot of his ability to participate in society.<p>Similarly, there are many, many employers who will dismiss any chance for job based on mere presence on the list. No questions, no mitigating circumstance. This is a punishment that is life-long, goes far beyond the crime, and honestly, leaves little recourse for the offender to become a drain on society, or turn to further crimes just to get by.

4496397,comment,4490591,4493985,1,0,jkestner,,,"This speaks to some of the low(-ish) hanging fruit in manufacturing that software can help with. I think we're closer to having the LaserWriter of 3D printing than the Pagemaker.\nIt's a huge understatement to say that CAD/CAM software sucks. Start by chipping away at small, solvable but labor-intensive parts, in the vein of Stripe.<p>Make tools that provide constraints that reflect the real world, in the hands of the designer. How often do you see beautiful design concepts that have zero draft or unmoldable overhangs? If those are things that are irrelevant with additive printing, then render the preview in no greater resolution than what the printer can produce, and identify the grain along which your part will break.<p>This will lead us to what my partner calls augmented fabrication. He prototyped Part Preview, a ""Print Preview"" for milling machines, projecting toolpaths onto your material or using a Kinect to intersect the blank with the model (unfortunately, no documentation except for <a href=""http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20111010/lab-report-2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20111010/lab-report-2</a> and a thesis paper).<p>We need tighter integration between the software used to design objects and the hardware that manufactures them. Protomold is a step in the right direction. Because they control much of the process, they can tell you how your uploaded design needs to change to be manufacturable. That's an API for manufacturing - it digitizes something about the physical process. And it's a great educational tool. It's all about reducing the length of the feedback loop so that we can make mistakes and learn faster.",1347213377
4496396,comment,4489211,4496366,2,0,shmerl,,,"<i>Jordan and Egypt have recsinded any claims to those territories</i><p>That's exactly my point why those territories aren't occupied. The only way to call them occupied if Egypt or Jordan would still claim their authority over them. But as you said - they don't. Therefore while their status isn't clear, they aren't occupied. I.e. they are not more occupied by ""Israeli Civil Authority"", as they are occupied by the ""Palestinian Authority"" (i.e. Fatah and Hamas). At least that's how I view it.<p>Oslo agreements weren't supported by Arabs (de facto), therefore they are morally void for a long time already.

4496394,comment,4494739,4496227,1,0,Tycho,,,"From what I can tell, the ability of 3/4ths of the band to sing well was a lot less remarkable for the time period. Nowadays it would really set a band apart but back then guitar bands with vocal harmonies was trending. Most such bands just didn't have any songwriting power. Plus when you consider that McCartney was the only really gifted vocalist, it's not that remarkable. Their perceived charisma and attractiveness stems from their status, which was earned through superior songwriting/record-making.<p>It's hardly suprising that two genius songwriters managed to develop good instrumental abilities, attract other talent (a great drummer, a great producer, a great guitarist), put out records with great vocal arrangements, and bring out the best in covers. And be worshipped by the public. Those things are almost inevitable. The only surprising thing was that they ended up in the same band.",1347213333

We once received a complaint about an Egyptian forum that was supposedly hosting child pornography.  The site was not hosted with us, but we were the domain registrar.<p>The complainant said that the forum had a secret board where users swapped child porn.  They sent several links that did indeed show that child pornography was on the site and domain.  However, since we only provided the domain registration, our response to the complainant was to contact the web host.<p>The complainant replied back with more links.  That is when my boss became involved.  She had very little experience with dealing with abuse issues, however, she was very vocal about the fact that our company was 'allowing' child pornography.  She had us put the domain on ""Client hold"", which effectively disables the domain, removing the name servers from the registry.  Afterwards, she scolded me and my two other colleagues for not taking the correct action (even though we were following our SOP based on our terms of service).

But it makes sense to pull some of these ideas out together just to think about.<p>To start, take a look at this image:  <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/Rhein_II.jpg/300px-Rhein_II.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/aa/Rhein_II...</a><p>This is <i>Rhein II, an image by [Andreas] Gursky, [which] fetched $4.3m (2.7m) at Christie's, New York on November 8, 2011, becoming the most expensive photograph ever sold.</i> [According to wikipedia.]<p>So, why look at this? Well, it adresses a couple of things.  If you think you know what does and ""does not look like photoshop"" this will expand your data set.  In particular, its not high contrast, or brightly colored or really in any way showing ""photoshop"".  In fact, its not even a digital capture, its film.  But the reason why this is the most expensive photograph in the world?  Its a tour de-force of photoshop. Its so good, its invisible.  Its full of mind-tricks. The space is completely unnatural, yet it looks perfectly normal.  Etc.<p>But to a trained eye, this very much ""looks like photoshop"".<p>And it looks like alot of other images. Not all of which are so mind-bending, but in subtle and not so subtle ways may distort reality. Lots of PJ work has this color pallete and tonal range, but of course they aren't allowed all the fun that Gursky gets to have. And so often they just take their ""visual look"" and overall style from this school of Art.<p>The visual signature is very, very difficult if not impossible to pull off [in color] using modern analogue methods, not to mention more primitive.  But MFA kids and the like can pull it off all the time, from just about and image input.

I tend to go on my other accounts on my iPad and iPhone more because of the Twitter app so good point.<p>I wonder though if Twitter really wants to encourage people to have multiple accounts? I mean, they don't do much to stop it but they also don't encourage it. So two questions:<p>1. Does or would It make sense for Twitter to frown upon multiple accounts per user? Honestly asking, I can see both good and bad in it and I wonder, if you (the collective ""you"", that is) were Twitter, would you want this, not like it, or not care either way?<p>2. If the Twitter site had an easy way to switch between accounts like the iOS apps do, would this encourage more people to create multiple accounts? Or would only the portion of users who already seek out multiple accounts use it while those who don't have them simply not use the feature? To put it another way (sorry to repeat myself but I just want to be really clear) does having that feature encourage people only have one account to use the ability to switch between accounts just because they can?",1347212557

Because I've seen so many black and white or sepia photos of the past I have this weird image in my head that everything back before color photos was dark and dreary and even people living in that time, in color, saw everything as washed out and bleak. After seeing these in color, ""true"" color (as in not added after the fact), one thing stays the same. If you pay attention you'll notice that every shot with people in it feels dreary. No one is smiling. Everyone has the same almost depressed, somewhat emotionless expression on their faces. So while I have a hard time dealing with the fact that the world was in color back then the one thing I don't have to reconcile with my preconceived notions of the past is how gloomy the people all seem. I wonder why everyone in old photos states blankly like that. Is it because they're genuinely living a hard life? Could it be that smiling for photos wasn't customary back then? Both?<p>Also, photos from the 60's through the early 80's also seem to have a unique feel to them. I live in Chicago where some of the buildings have been around since just after the Chicago Fire and to see pictures taken of such places through the 20th century is so strange. I know intellectually that people saw the area in full color like I see it today but somehow older photos of the same streets and places I walk by feel like they're just not the same place. In an old photo a certain building or park will seem, well, old yet when I walk by it, it seems modern as ever even though the place hasnt physically changed much if it all since the early 1900's.<p>It's weird and I'm glad to know other people have that same sort of relation to older photos.

Excel doesn't let you define functions (i.e. it doesn't let you lay out formulas in cells and then call them repeatedly with different data) or types (i.e. it doesn't let you make multiple instances of a common model). It has variables, but the naming mechanism is primitive and not well integrated, so most people just work with raw cell addresses. And it arguably does have mutable data, because you can change what's in any cell at any time. I say ""arguably"" because one can argue the opposite: a spreadsheet defines one big pure function and if you change a cell then you're really just calling that function with a different input or changing the definition of the function. But I don't think anybody ""feels"" (or, for that matter, implements) spreadsheets that way. The cell contents feel like state and editing them feels like altering a machine as it runs.<p>To some extent it's a matter of how you frame it. If one expanded the identity of, say, a Haskell program to include both its code as it changes over time in the editor and the data that it gets applied to over time, it would seem mutable. No one looks at a Haskell program that way because we draw sharp lines between editing it, compiling it, and running it. But in spreadsheets those lines don't really exist.

Do searches on Google News for topics or companies you compete with.  See who has covered them and create a spreadsheet with their names, contact info, etc -- This tells you they might be interested in what you have<p>2.  Reach out and personalize -- Show them you've seen and taken time to understand their perspective on the industry or competitor.  In a nice way, suggest an angle that you feel is more interesting or which often gets overlooked which hopefully dovetails with your product and piques their interest.  This helps the blogger/journalist think about the storyline and whether readers would find it interesting quickly and not your X, Y, Z feature which only you care about.<p>3.  The angle should ideally be something you have unique insight into.  It might be directly related to your product or just something you have data on because of your product.<p>4.  Use data as possible.  There are lots of unsubstantiated claims out there so journalists/data appreciate useful facts supported by data.  Warning:  Don't make data/facts up or don't try to draw inane trends from 2 data points as smart journalists/bloggers will see through that.  Yes, hack doesn't mean being dishonest.  You're trying to build a relationship based on trust so don't be short-term greedy and try to kickstart things on a lie.<p>There are some downsides to this.  The biggest being that your data might get featured and not your company.  This may not be what you want.  But, at the same time, you may become a resource for the journalist which means mentions over time, they may come back to you for additional data and you get mentions.  This has happened for us.  We're a data company so we might not be apples to apples for you, but we're a go to resource for journos/bloggers and see mentions 1-2 per week in a slow week in major media because of early legwork we did (note: our press page is hopelessly outdated so don't judge us based on that)<p>Hope this helps.

If your answer is ""no"", you should not work in engineering.<p>And if you spend hours of your personal time to scout message boards only to post a bunch crap that boils down to ""use the search, ha-ha"", the Internet will be a better place without you.<p>Nobody owes you anything just because you think of yourself as some kind of guru. Not even people who ask questions or request easily digestible solutions. This is not academia. You're not a professor, who can ask his students to demonstrate ""effort"".<p>You don't want to answer basic question? Don't answer them. Ignore them. It's easy. It takes much less time than whining about this imaginary problem.",1347210177

I am completely at ease with the idea of promoting free speech whilst going against free speech in the event of something which is harmful (I am referring to real child pornography not what the law currently classifies) and with no merit, not even the wildest interpretations of educational or artistic merit can redeem the need for child pornography to exist.",1347210035

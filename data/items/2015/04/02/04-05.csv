If any individual, organization, government, etc. were intending to MITM someone, we could (in theory) track them down and fire them, blacklist their root, or otherwise expel them from the internet community.

It&#x27;s terrifying that a series of honest mistakes (extremely grievous mistakes, but honest ones nonetheless) could lead to a valid cert for Google and Twitter in the hands of someone who didn&#x27;t even want them.<p>I think a very tiny bit of blame should impute to Palo Alto Networks here. How have they built a device where it&#x27;s easy to start MITMing certificates by accident? I&#x27;m all for usable crypto UI, but this seems excessive. (And should it be built with safeguards that warn you loudly when the MITM intermediate chains to a publicly-valid CA, instead of an in-house one?)<p>Regarding why I think it&#x27;s perfectly believable that CNNIC was the easiest CA that would chain them an intermediate: everyone that runs an actual intermediate program sells (as required by the Baseline Requirements) a hardware security module, or better yet, a web interface to a cert that remains in the physical possession of the parent CA. There&#x27;s an arduous audit process and key ceremony required for the intermediate CA, almost as arduous as required of the root CA. CNNIC, meanwhile, had no intermediate program, and wrote in their Certification Practices Statement that they don&#x27;t intend to issue such things. So MCS was able to talk them into doing something irresponsible and handing them a CSR and no further details.",1427949402

9308679,comment,9307934,9307934,0,0,fivedogit,,,"Wrong. Tesla is a <i>distribution</i> company. Cars and batteries are commodities, more or less. Corporations are now extremely efficient at copying and commoditizing their competitors&#x27; innovations - just look at how fast the android ecosystem popped up alongside iPhone - so technological advancements are not the real source of long term value but merely the temporary advantage needed to be first to a market and set up <i>network effects</i>.<p>EBay, for instance, was there at the right time to take recent technology advancements, set up a network-effect marketplace and milk it for, oh, 2 decades. They stopped being a technology company a long time ago.<p>So how does this relate to Tesla? Answer: The supercharging stations. If Tesla owns the most charging stations then EV buyers have a good reason to buy Tesla over a hypothetical Ford or Toyota EV, putting Tesla at a major advantage. Eventually it&#x27;ll be on Ford and Toyota to bet the farm on a massive supercharger network of their own and launch an EV to compete against Tesla&#x27;s entrenched domination of the marketplace. Right now, Tesla is in a fleeting moment of technological and branding advantage which they are correctly leveraging to quickly set up their charging network.<p>It&#x27;s a lot like telcos bragging about their coverage networks. Eventually all the (surviving) car companies will be doing something similar, running TV ads about their charging station maps.<p>Companies are either A) marketing companies or B) distribution companies or a blend of both.<p>Nike is a marketing company that happens to sell shoes. Ditto Taco Bell and cheap Mexican food.<p>Amazon, Akamai, Google and Facebook are distribution companies --- they own the network or marketplace.<p>Disney (mostly distribution), American Airlines (mostly distributiom) Walmart (mostly distribution) and Apple (mostly marketing/branding, but appstore and itunes are distribution powerhouses) are a little of both.<p>Edit: Nielsen, Google are distribution comapnies. They have prohibitively large or complicated information ingestion systems set up to and then resell the results.<p>Newspapers and TV are too, but their distribution monopolies are crumbling.<p>Interesting. That means solar advancements are very bad for Tesla. If people don&#x27;t need to stop and charge, then the distribution network is worthless.",1427948989

Conversely, compare this: (yum|apt-get|port) install (postgresql|mysql|apache|nginx).\n> Come on. No one who has ever installed any of those things in production would pretend it&#x27;s so simple. You&#x27;re going to spend so much time on configuration that the difference between apt-get and running an .msi is negligible.<p>Actually, no. This discussion is about development and configuration of a workstation for development and the necessity to have the developers run the same unit tests that also need to run the same on the integration servers (not Windows). For the vast majority of cases, actually yes, all one needs is a apt-get/yum/port install of the package dependencies and that&#x27;s it -- most if not all &quot;out of the box&quot; configuration for most developers will work just fine for the development environment (ie, the developer&#x27;s workstation). Additionally, those system package managers provide a much simpler and easier way for a developer to manage system updates (have you ever used Windows update? it&#x27;s unbelievably slow).<p>And, to your above reference, re: Ubuntu, while I&#x27;ve personally never had any issues with using Ubuntu as a production server, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing that (and do not use it where I have direct authority/control or choice), because for production one would want &#x27;debian stable&#x27; (and is what I have recommended for years). One would not want a headless server environment to use Ubuntu, as the differences that make &#x27;Ubuntu&#x27; vs &#x27;debian testing&#x27; are primarily downstream additions that are only good/applicable to the desktop and do nothing to help the underlying stability of the system.<p>To emphasize here, I am not discussing simple one-off Wordpress deployments for your hobbyist blog that likely no one reads, and that you most likely don&#x27;t even need xcache for. I highly doubt you have the traffic volumes wherein xcache would actually show significant improvement/performance over nothing at all (do you even understand what xcache does?). And if you did, you should likely move on to HHVM (which, btw, is production ready, and works out of the box for the most popular distributions).<p>Quite frankly, the fact that you are discussing compiling a .so for xcache on Ubuntu shows just how far behind the time you are on the state of Ubuntu and PHP as there are working xcache apt repositories that you can use quite simply, please see: <a href=""https://www.dotdeb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dotdeb.org/</a> . Your anecdotal failure of having a problem building a single .so (which you shouldn&#x27;t have been wasting time compiling yourself anyways), is only representative of your particular issues and is not at all representative of how software is actually used, developed, tested, and deployed in large, significant (monetarily, culturally, politically, etc) systems.<p>Additionally, the most basic &quot;best practices&quot; for system administration would call for the use of packages wherever possible. Manually compiling extensions (or other dependencies) that you did not write (xcache), directly, on your production linode instance, really shows that you are likely treating your server instances as pets and not as cattle, which doesn&#x27;t really work in the cloud / server &#x27;farm&#x27; paradigm. It also shows that you&#x27;re likely not working in a large, audited secure environment wherein all commands/actions/configuration changes need to be signed off / logged. I&#x27;m also going to guess you do not understand the intricacies of continuous integration/deployment, security, and many other basic aspects/tenets of system administration, and, thus, do not fully grasp why what you did -- manually compiling a .so on a server -- is such a no-no.<p>Please understand, I am coming from a background of building large, mission-critical software projects with large, geographically diverse teams who have varied skillset levels (from newbie to guru), and that the necessity to conform to corporate and governmental regulations (audit or otherwise) is non-negotiable, and thus certain things must be done (automated testing, etc) which in turn limits the scope of what can be done with minimal resources/time. Bringing this back to relevancy and &#x27;Spartan&#x27;, this is why without working ports that fit into existing toolchains (unit testing on Unix-likes), it will never be a relevant (nor in my book, &quot;modern&quot;) browser unless it magically gains significant market share overnight. I find that highly unlikely since Windows is a dying platform, and the majority of users have shifted to mobile. I also find it highly unlikely that Windows will start to outpace Android or iOS anytime soon as a mobile platform. While I welcome the new browser, Microsoft is unlikely to gain the needed marketshare unless they give developers the features/tools they need to integrate into existing, well-developed workflows/infrastructure. That isn&#x27;t going to happen without a Unix port.",1427948631

Suggesting ideas, finding great sources, and the overall experience of the IA are all better if coming from someone who really wants to improve searches for that topic.  <a href=""https://duck.co/help/community/contributing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duck.co/help/community/contributing</a><p>Let me know if you&#x27;re interested in getting involved--any time :)",1427948490

They designed their operational structures without the convenience of modern technology, and therefore relied on expanding work forces to grow their company. Labor was cheap, and necessary for growth at the time because humans had to do so much more than they do now.<p>Facebook is a multinational company with only a few thousand fulltime employees. If GE or Microsoft developed in the same technological context as facebook, they would likely employ far fewer people than they do now.

Once the exponent gets involved, everything that influences the left of the decimal point is an integer.  That&#x27;s why you use the same base for the mantissa and the exponent.

My peak use of social media was while I was attending university on the other side of the world.<p>But since a couple of years ago, almost everyone I care about is only a local call away from me. Over the last couple of years, I have drastically reduced my social media usage, and it wasn&#x27;t because of the Snowden revelations. I just don&#x27;t feel the need to ping someone on <insert your favorite social network here> when I can just call them up or, even better, meet them IRL.<p>Having lived for a decade in the second-largest country in the world, my sense of distance also seems to have become a little weird compared to those of others in my home country. Oh, Granny is only a five-hour drive away from me? Why even bother talking on the phone then? I&#x27;ll just drive there and see her in person this weekend.

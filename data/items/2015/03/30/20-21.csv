9292579,comment,9291215,9292497,0,0,aaronbrethorst,,,"Sorry, I was more vague on that initially than I should&#x27;ve been. I&#x27;ve answered this elsewhere, but: what I was referring to was delivering value on behalf of someone else vs. using a given problem as an opportunity to learn something new. Delivering value (e.g. adding a new feature to your product, fixing a bug in a shipping product, identifying and attacking a market opportunity) shouldn&#x27;t be seen as an excuse to learn a new technology unless you have absolutely no pressure to ship that work on any sort of schedule at any presumed level of acceptable quality.<p>I&#x27;m the same way: I need a real problem to work whether I&#x27;m applying skills I know or skills I want to learn. I just don&#x27;t ever promise anyone (except myself) anything when I&#x27;m applying technologies I don&#x27;t yet know to the problem.",1427749177

I also leave later than most people, often work overtime, and sometimes I&#x27;ll work on the weekends, all on my own accord and without getting paid extra.<p>Now, in many places, I could just /see/ the discomfort this causes in people, especially those who feel like they&#x27;re obligated to show up at 8, and leave at 5. Lip service is paid to the usual &quot;as long as you get your work done&quot;, but more than a few times I&#x27;ve been pulled aside to be asked &quot;could you please come in earlier&quot; - or I can sense tension when I walk in and some coworkers have been in for an hour already.<p>It&#x27;s all really frustrating.

Certainty in an extrinsic reward causes overjustification.<p>An uncertain extrinsic reward seems to mute the overjustification effect increasing the intrinsic motivation within the process, while still affording some of the incentives that you&#x27;re looking for.<p>When we are outside of the process we weight the certain reward more highly than the uncertain reward.  But a certainty in the reward means we lose our intrinsic motivation within the process and replace it with direct motivation towards the goal, for instance you might stop doing something because it&#x27;s not worth the 2 dollars you&#x27;ll get.  An uncertain reward lets us stay motivated within the process. For instance, something might not be worth the 1 or 2 dollars you will get, but you might be motivated to stick it out till the end just to see whether you&#x27;ll get 1 or 2, or because it&#x27;s fun, and you&#x27;re not necessarily going to get 2 anyways.<p>When you can abstract a process down to &quot;Do x, get y&quot; your enjoyment of x can get caught up in your value of y.  When it is &quot;Do x, get y or get z&quot; then your enjoyment of x might stand alone, because you can&#x27;t relate it specifically to y or z.<p>If it&#x27;s worth it to do x for y, and z is more, then you might be interested to see if you get z, so you be excited to do x to see if you will win z, and be satisfied with y if you don&#x27;t.<p>If it&#x27;s only worth it to do x for z, then you have to take into account that you might get y.  If you might get y, and it&#x27;s not worth it, then there&#x27;s some cognitive dissonance, one way for you to resolve that is to say that you just enjoy x even if you do get the lesser prize.<p>Either way, you&#x27;re not thinking about abstracting the whole process into a routine to get y.  It&#x27;s either y with occasional exciting bonuses, or it&#x27;s doing x because it&#x27;s enjoyable and sometimes getting fair compensation for your time.<p>Think of it this way.  Think of an employee paid hourly, $20/hr.  They can come to work for as long as they want, and they have a budget of $400/week. They work 20 hours a week, except on the odd occasion when they want to save a bit more or splurge.<p>Then consider an employee paid hourly $15/hr.  They can also come to work for as long as they want and have a budget of $400/week.  The difference is there&#x27;s a 25% chance every hour that they will get an extra $20.  They&#x27;re going to feel differently, If they get $400 in their first 15 hours, they might be excited.  They might keep working and make themselves a bit of extra cash, or they might go home early.  If they don&#x27;t make the bonus at all, they know that&#x27;s a possibility and they will work the 27 hours they need to make ends meet.<p>On average both employees need to work the same amount to reach their budget.  The second employee is more likely going to work more than 20 hours per week on average. They&#x27;ve already resigned to the fact that 27 hour weeks might happen, but that will rarely happen.  They will justify that $15/hr is OK. The rest is gravy.  They&#x27;re lucky to get it.  The job&#x27;s not so bad at $15/hr.  The bonus is nice but not something you have to live off of, 27 hours isn&#x27;t a bad work week in the worst case.<p>Both employees have the same average wage, but I think the second is more likely to work more hours over the course of a year.  If the budget of the first person were to shrink or grow, they would more directly adjust their schedule than the second employee would.  If the second employee were to actually like their job, they would be more motivated to go to it just to see if they could get more bonus regardless of what was needed.<p>In some ways you ironically feel more in control of the latter scenario.  I don&#x27;t need to go into work this week (because I earned a lot of bonus) but I want to because I choose to see if I can earn more bonus, if not, the job&#x27;s not so bad anyways.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s easier to sell someone on the idea of a job that&#x27;s $20/hr than a job that&#x27;s $15/hr and randomly $35/hr.",1427748897

And to force banks to lend, by adding a cost to their cash holdings.<p>Something the parent comment doesn&#x27;t seem to realize, is that having negative interest rates is a sign your economy is not functioning properly. If you have to resort to negative interest rates to keep assets from falling in value, and to drive consumer spending or bank loans, then you&#x27;re already in deep trouble. Sweden&#x27;s negative interest rates are likely an indication that a storm is coming for them; were they to raise interest rates it would cause a recession; and if they don&#x27;t raise interest rates, their real estate bubble will continue to inflate until it explodes.

Microsoft borrowed our idea and did their whole &quot;bing and decide&quot; campaign.<p>Many people realize that if you put Google ads on Bing&#x27;s results and Bing&#x27;s ads on Google results the profitability would switch (not that I am entirely sure what that says other than having a credible search engine <i>and</i> top end Ad inventory is required to make excess money in search)<p>It will be interesting to see if Marissa gets back into the game with Yahoo when their agreement to use Bing results for Yahoo searches expires.<p>The interesting linkage is that you can&#x27;t sell search advertising unless people send the search request to you, and if you&#x27;re not the most common place that people search, you&#x27;re unlikely to get first shot at advertising. You can &quot;buy&quot; traffic (that is called Paid Distribution) by putting your search box on people&#x27;s web site, or causing someone&#x27;s browser to send you search queries first, or paying a phone maker to send you all their search queries, but you have to make enough money from the ads to offset what you pay. And as I mentioned over the last 8 years Google has been paying more and more for their traffic (up to $968M last <i>quarter</i>) and very few entrants into the business are going to compete with that. If you already have a platform (like Mozilla has Firefox, Apple has the iPhone, Facebook has pretty much everyone&#x27;s Facebook page) so you &quot;own&quot; the ingress point, you can leverage that with a good search engine to make a lot of revenue. But if you need to pay for access to the ingress point, and pay a big chunk to the ad provider, it is really hard to support a lot of infrastructure (which is proportionally expensive to index size). That is the constraint box of search today.<p>The interesting thing for me is that every quarter, of the last 16, Bing has been making more money per click and Google less, that cost equation is balancing out. That is going to put a lot of pressure on the non-core parts of Google.<p>To answer your question, Google <i>succeeded</i> well when capturing the value of linkage data to extract page relevance (the original Page Rank patent), they created an advertising incentive which made their algorithm break (you want a billion in-links to your page, no problem! say the black hat SEO folks). Google is still making tons of money on search but you can look at their performance over the last 4 years to see the air is coming out of the balloon. What comes next is still an open question.",1427748315

While seeds\n  pitched by long winds onto newborn fields\n  burst open and rooted, perhaps some thistle\n  flourished on the quagga&#x27;s discarded innards.\n  The fractured island greened and hummed again;\n  handsome zebras tossed their heads\n  in zoos, on hired safari plains.\n  Who needs to hear a quagga&#x27;s voice?\n  Or see the warm hide twitch away a fly,\n\n  see the neck turn, curving its cream and chestnut stripes\n  that run down to plain dark haunches and plain white legs?\n  A kind of horse. Less picturesque than a dodo.

Of special note \n  are sections regarding faith \n  healing, self-loathing, abstract hobbies \n  like theoretical spelunking and extreme atrophy, \n  and what to say to loved ones \n  who won’t stop shrieking \n  at Christmas dinner. New to this edition \n  is an index of important terms \n  such as catheter, pain, blackout, \n  pathological deltoid obsession, escort service, \n  magnetic resonance imaging, \n  loss of friends due to superstitious fear, \n  and, of course, amputation \n  above the knee due to pernicious gangrene. \n  It is our hope that this guide \n  will be a valuable resource \n  during this long stretch of boredom and dread \n  and that it may be of some help, \n  however small, to cope with your new life \n  and the gradual, bittersweet loss \n  of every God damned thing you ever loved.</code></pre>",1427747671

Now of course there might be prosecutors intending to charge them as accessories, but it might be as simple as wanting to compel testimony about the admins.<p>For example, Suppose you sell servers, and someone calls you up one day wanting 30 of them. You hit it off with this client, a friendship develops, and 6 months later that person, in an unguarded moment, says &#x27;heh, I bet you never thought those 30 servers would end up as part of the &#x27;Drugz, maaan&#x27; empire.&#x27; Now, unless you&#x27;re a mandated reporter nothing criminal has occurred so far - you gained knowledge of criminal activity, but your friend hasn&#x27;t ordered any more servers from you and so you&#x27;re not taking part in any conspiracy, plus you were paid long before you learned this information (let&#x27;s assume you can prove all this). However, if you bragged to someone else that you knew who the boss of &#x27;Drugz, maan&#x27; is, then prosecutors would be able to subpoena your testimony whether you wanted to give it or not.<p>This is just a made-up example; I just want to point out that it&#x27;s not necessarily a question of criminality <i>or</i> free speech. The government (ie the US government, following common law principles)has always been able to compel testimony except from a defendant or a small class of other people who have an intimate relationship with a defendant (doctor/attorney/clergy person). Even though a witness may object to being called and not want to help the prosecution at all (ie a hostile witness), there&#x27;s still an obligation to testify truthfully.

As a5seo pointed out, we did pay certain users for reviews (much like Yelp in its early days) and offer other incentives (e.g. donations to local charities). Our average cost per review was around $1-3 when you factored in all the incentives (note that +50% of our reviews came from unpaid reviewers). The average number of reviews per user was 8 - much less than the &quot;hundreds&quot; claimed above. There were a few users that wrote +100 reviews, but they all worked in real estate (e.g. agents/brokers).<p>The major problem with &quot;apartment reviews&quot; is that the average person has only lived in 3-4 places and doesn&#x27;t typically want to write about places they&#x27;ve visited, which significantly limits the # of potential reviews per user. As a rule of them, only ~1% of users contribute content, so you really need that 1% to contribute a lot of content. This works for Yelp because that 1% can contribute hundreds or thousands of reviews (e.g. they may try a new restaurant every week). But this isn&#x27;t the case for housing given the low turnover.<p>Brokers can write significantly more reviews but some users found their reviews to be biased (e.g. only giving positive reviews to apartment communities that they represent). The brokers were also very motivated by money, so unless you have an established audience that will help them secure new business, it&#x27;s a tough sell.<p>Overall, I learned quite a bit from the experience and definitely think there are numerous ways that startups could bring greater transparency to the rental market. But if you&#x27;re trying to do &quot;apartment reviews,&quot; just understand that this will likely take you many years and many VCs are unwilling to be that patient.<p>If you want to know anything else about my experience with Swapt, just ask or hit me up on LinkedIn.

(i.e. to automatically play what is statistically the optimum response to any given hand.) I never saw that feature offered anywhere else, presumably because players playing imperfect games means more take for the house - but even so, a thousand perfect hands of basic stategy will almost always still leave the house having had the better side of the deal, purely due to the house edge that&#x27;s built into the game.<p>(What caused me to give up was an extremely expensive blackjack hand that started with betting $HOUSE_MAX on a hand, and getting a pair of aces. The best move is to split aces, resulting in two hands, at double the bet. And in this case, both those hands were then facing a dealer hand where basic strategy demands that you double down - so an already significant bet ended up being doubled, then doubled again. It was absolutely the right move, statistically, but didn&#x27;t go my way in the end, and although I still walked away in profit, that hand is what made me think that Blackjack was something that could one day cause me a real problem if I didn&#x27;t find something better to do with my time.)",1427746942

I look down\n\n  Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds   \n  Bends low, comes up twenty years away   \n  Stooping in rhythm through potato drills   \n  Where he was digging.\n\n  The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft   \n  Against the inside knee was levered firmly.\n  He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep\n  To scatter new potatoes that we picked,\n  Loving their cool hardness in our hands.\n\n  By God, the old man could handle a spade.   \n  Just like his old man.\n\n  My grandfather cut more turf in a day\n  Than any other man on Toner’s bog.\n  Once I carried him milk in a bottle\n  Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up\n  To drink it, then fell to right away\n  Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods\n  Over his shoulder, going down and down\n  For the good turf. Digging.\n\n  The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap\n  Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge\n  Through living roots awaken in my head.\n  But I’ve no spade to follow men like them.\n\n  Between my finger and my thumb\n  The squat pen rests.\n  I’ll dig with it.</code></pre>",1427746560

The computer I&#x27;m typing this on is definitely &quot;underwater&quot; in that it&#x27;s worth less than I paid. Almost every investment transaction (stocks, etc) are underwater the moment you make them because of transaction fees. If your ability to pay is unchanged and you don&#x27;t need the liquidity (ie, you don&#x27;t need to move today), I don&#x27;t see the problem. You got the short end of the stick, sure, but it was your deal to make or not make in the first place.<p>Further, if you&#x27;re considering a home purchase in financial/investment terms, you&#x27;ve got to consider the time scale - real estate operates in terms of decades. A lot of people got used to multi-digit yearly appreciation and to this day think anything else is a bad deal, when it&#x27;s actually more on-par with other investment vehicles after the adjustment.<p>> <i>Negative equity is decidedly here to stay, and will impact the market for years to come.</i><p>I wonder how much of this is because low-money-down lending (FHA, VA) has opened back up, with down payments barely (if at all) covering transaction costs. It could actually be a good indicator for affordability.<p>Anyway, I assume you&#x27;re at peace with your decision and I&#x27;m not trying to convince you otherwise.

We&#x27;re hoping to get away with making the entire thing an SPA as there&#x27;s a lot of real-time, interactive user data the user sees even outside of the mini-apps as they&#x27;re browsing the marketplace. One thing that&#x27;s a bit of an issue is, of course, SEO. All of the marketplace content comes from a RESTful service completely separate from the web service providing the main SPA. I&#x27;ve been playing a bit with the este.js stack (https://github.com/Steida/este) and that seems like a very solid combo of technologies. One thing that&#x27;s a slight concern to me is the volume of calls the SPA server would be making to the REST API server if we were to succeed with the isomorphism, especially if a crawler hits and scrapes all of the pages. Another thing I&#x27;m a bit unsure of is how the socket.io content will work when we&#x27;re getting crawled. How does socket.io behave in an isomorphic setting?\nI&#x27;ve written SPAs before, but never had to worry about SEO (they were internal products sold directly to customers - the contents of the SPA never needed crawling).

Cavafy is a Greek poet who lived in Alexandria in the beginning of the century. He was very shy, he never sold any of his poets. He made copies and distributed his poetry to friends only. He was a perfectionists. Reports say that he would literally work up to 20 years to a single poem, changing words, syllables or entire lines accordingly. His poetry greatly improved as he grew older. Personally, I enjoyed this version[1] by Sir Sean Connery.<p>Then I also admire deeply Shakespeare. To me Shakespeare is like a crossroad between, poetry, philosophy, love, wisdom. An unbelievably refreshing, well-made cocktail of thought and art.<p>Those two poets are the ones that touch my spirit the most :-)<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n3n2Ox4Yfk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n3n2Ox4Yfk</a>",1427745891

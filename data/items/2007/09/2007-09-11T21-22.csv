After earlier decades of no-growth politics, San Francisco is having multiple towers, both residential and office, built now.  Its exciting to see, and it may be one of the keys making SF extremely attractive for up and coming technology companies in the future.  Why be in the burbs when you can work and live in a world class city?",1189547926

He was also supposed to sell the accounts and we would split the money coming in 50/50.<p>That system was www.profolios.com which I am very proud of, I made it in about 2003 and it works pretty good (although the html design is dated the backend code is excellent).  <p>We parted ways, I left him with the code and I have the code too.  I have not decided to do anything with it yet but one day I might.<p>This was the most equitable solution because I didn't want to leave him hanging.  He did try on his part to contribute but things just didn't work out.  Life is like that but now he is happy and I am perfectly happy too.  I eventually found a domain modelcoach.com on tdnam.com and picked it up.  One day I might revamp the model system code and put it back out there as a service.  I just have been focusing in on other things.<p>",1189547150

53555,comment,53414,53414,0,0,uuilly,,,"I use Mail.app for mac.  I have an IMAP account that has squirrel mail access and essentially infinite storage.  The squirrel mail was a pain and I went to gmail while I was in the corporate world.  Now that I have a startup I am mostly on my machine and the webmail is just a backup that I seldom use if I'm on another machine.<p>-I like drag and drop attachments.
-I like the OS integration.  Click on an email link from the browser, send something from iPhoto etc...
-I hate that when I hit tab on gmail it focuses on the send button.  
-I like having email offline.
-I like to be able to fast-seach AND THEN sort.
-I like realtime spellcheck.<p>Gmail is the best web interface by far but in my opinion it is inferior to mail.app.  I think the tipping point comes when you're spending more time on a machine w/o your client, gmail is the way to go.",1189546426
53554,comment,53414,53445,0,0,tx,,,"Gmail is my choice <i>only</i> because it is relatively ad-free. Lack of folders, down-my-throat ""conversations"" instead of individual messages and pathetic editor are a pain in the back. Gmail sucks when you're managing 4-5 simultaneous email threads daily with various random incoming messages.<p>I use 3 different computers running two OS'es - that is the <i>only</i> reason I use web-based mail. Back in the day when everything was on my laptop, I liked ""TheBat!"" and ThunderBird.

Maybe Markham's non-participation gnaws at PG, but I'm guessing that it doesn't.<p>BTW - The vast majority of YC particpants are foregoing significant income and the lifestyle that goes with it, a lifestyle not unlike Markham's.  Why is only the latter worthy of consideration?<p>However, we have established that Markham can easily self-fund at the level that he requested from YC.  I look forward to seeing the result.<p>",1189545200

53542,comment,53535,53535,0,0,karzeem,,,"Obviously, Silicon Valley is the capital of the startup world.  But would a startup that's successful there fail in New York?<p>My wariness about the Bay Area is mainly related to groupthink.  Being surrounded by people who are all in the same industry, thinking about the same issues, talking about the same things, has obvious benefits.  At the same time, it seems that the only companies that succeed, whether they're based in the Bay Area or not, are the ones that ignore an important piece of conventional wisdom.  And that seems like it would be harder to do when you're immersed in it.  If you don't want to drink the Kool-Aid, you should have some hesitation about moving to the factory.<p>The upside of New York specifically, and Boston too (besides the fact that they're beautiful, vibrant cities), is the cross-pollination you get by being in touch with different cultures and industries.  In the right circumstances, that benefit could greatly outweigh the value of being in a place that has bigger-name VCs and contacts.<p>And lastly, Google's second-biggest office is in New York, so that may be the beginning of something very important there.",1189544719

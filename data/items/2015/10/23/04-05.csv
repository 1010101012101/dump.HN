Politicians are mostly addicted to power and support keeping power, even if that means screwing the ideals they supposedly espouse. And keeping power in a democratic republic involves keeping funding for the next election cycle.

Most male teachers just roll with it until they have to make a sarcastic, embarrassing remark which short circuits it (never heckle a teacher or a stand-up comic--they&#x27;ve seen it all before).  Female teachers tend to react more strongly.  I suspect its a physical thing--boys start getting problematically large for most women about 7th or 8th grade and if, as a female, you don&#x27;t nip it in the bud hard and fast, you can lose control over the situation.<p>3) Boys need male role models just as women need female role models.<p>4) Male teachers don&#x27;t tend to view approval by their students as something useful or desirable (in the case of approval by the female students--it&#x27;s downright dangerous).  The better female teachers are in the same boat, but there are a <i>LOT</i> of female teachers that actively try to gain their student&#x27;s approval.<p>If we stew all that together with an absence of male teachers, I suspect that you have more than enough unconscious bias to account for everything.",1445575340

However, I think I have experienced some similar feelings lately.  I&#x27;ve been trying to write some literate coffeescript and one of the problems I was running into is that it is just a PITA to edit.  You&#x27;ve got this huge block of text that you have to jump around every time you want to edit anything.<p>So, I got the idea to factor it, like the program that it is, and add links all over the place.  That way, if you want to view the explanation you can, but you don&#x27;t have to.  Also, I don&#x27;t have to wade through the documentation every time I&#x27;m looking to make a change.<p>And then I started to think, &quot;How are people going to read this?&quot;  One of the ideas of literate programming is that you &quot;weave&quot; the human representation in a way that is best for the human to understand.  But now I have a hypertext document, which allows the reader to &quot;weave&quot; their own path through the code/explanation.<p>Furthermore, because I realized that not everyone will take the same path through the code, I started to reuse links in many different places.  You can&#x27;t assume that someone has seen something, since there is no narrative any more.  You have to make a network that is sensible from any &quot;angle&quot;.<p>I think this is very similar to the &quot;garden&quot; he describes.<p>Interestingly, because some of my colleagues are very opinionated I started worrying about some of the code.  I really thought that some of the things I was doing were &quot;good ideas&quot; (tm), but I was aware that there were some smart people with whom I work who would undoubtedly disagree.  Without the narrative, how do I invite discussion?<p>We have a culture of code reviews on our team and one of the things we value are small pull requests very frequently.  Especially if you have something potentially controversial, the idea is to post a quick PR and get feedback right away.  Personally, I also invite people to submit counter PRs that describe their ideas in code.<p>Now, this literate project of mine is a personal project, so I don&#x27;t have the luxury of a captive audience.  How do I attract people?  I actually sent around tweet sized emails to a few people with links to my code and said, &quot;What do you think about this?  Do you agree with the explanation?  Do you have other ideas?&quot;<p>This seems to me to be very similar to the &quot;stream&quot; concept that the author has.  However, all of this activity is really time consuming and labour intensive (especially making all the links and keeping them up to date!!!).  I think there is definitely some value to these ideas, but I need better tools ;-)",1445575340

Instead, this article is basically whining about &quot;programming is hard&quot; which is true but also something anyone trying to solve serious problems got over somewhere between high school and getting a real job.<p>OAuth is hard because it&#x27;s <i>pretending to solve</i> a hard technical problem (logging in and sharing some private data securely) while <i>actually solving</i> an easy business problem (how do we (a big company) get smaller companies to outsource as much of their user data as possible to us). It <i>kind of</i> solves the hard technical problem (because bigger companies are better at hiding the data you give them from other companies who don&#x27;t pay for it, and have all your data anyway). But if that half-assed solution to the hard problem is good enough for you, you aren&#x27;t actually trying to solve it, you&#x27;re just to persuade uneducated users you&#x27;ve solved it. In short, OAuth For Dummies would be a tautological title for a book.<p>I&#x27;ve heard it said that it&#x27;s okay and even desirable to outsource everything in your business to other companies <i>except</i> your core service.

The elephant seemed distressed, so Peter approached it very carefully. He got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. As carefully and as gently as he could, Peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.<p>The elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. Peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. Eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. Peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.<p>Twenty years later, Peter was walking through the Chicago Zoo with his teenaged son. As they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Peter and his son Cameron were standing. The large bull elephant stared at Peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. The elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.<p>Remembering the encounter in 1986, Peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. Peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. The elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of Peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.<p>Probably wasn&#x27;t the same fucking elephant.<p>I absolutely loved &quot;Fishing with John&quot; - that doesn&#x27;t make the cancer-detecting dolphin a true story, though.",1445574957

However, <i>advantaged</i> males are way more successful than <i>advantaged</i> females. This leads to the somewhat paradoxical situation where males in high positions positing that men have an advantage because of their gender (because in the already advantaged group, they have seen the additional advantages of being male), and calling for more opportunities for females.<p>To give a practical example – as an Asian male who is not that good at coding, if I ask someone to explain some code to me, I am met with way less enthusiasm than if a female coder asks the same question. On the other hand, the guy giving the talk at the event has already written 10 libraries used by thousands of users, and codes kernel exploits in his spare time. He <i>is already at a high position in life</i> (in geek terms anyway), and tells me, &quot;Hey, you have male privilege and weren&#x27;t told to not code at elementary school. So we&#x27;re going to focus on helping women more at this event.&quot;<p>I wonder how we can solve this conundrum and give disadvantaged women at the top, and disadvantaged men at the bottom access to opportunities. One thing that would definitely lead to progress (in my opinion) is a recognition and broader understanding that &quot;male privilege&quot; is often (but not always) confined to the top 1-2% of males in a given broad category.

The same thing exists for races, ethnicities, etc. Basically, rather than looking at the background of a person these people tend to blindly make assumptions about exactly who and what they are. I think that this is one of the reasons affirmative action is especially broken -- a poor Asian student is basically doomed for failure whereas a rich Black student is going to have a huge advantage (over both White students at their socioeconomic level and poorer Black students). Rather than fixing the problem that people get unequal opportunities it sort of decides what the opportunities should be for every single person regardless of their actual situation, and that creates really skewed edge cases.<p>>Whats the deal with gender issues anyway in North America...<p>I think that the root of this issue is that there are basically two ways to fix inequalities: flattening out the entire system or raising those below up to the same level as everyone else. The technique that has proven most successful was really the type of communist philosophy that was used by lots of these Eastern European states, and that essentially comes out to be leveling the playing system by putting everyone below where they could possibly be.

On the other hand, the whole idea of authenticating through a third-party provider such as Google just centralizes identity with what ends up being a very small pool of select providers, because nobody wants to show 42 different &quot;login in with...&quot; buttons.<p>But all we really want is that browser can prove (cryptographically) to foo.com that I&#x27;m &quot;user #2048203&quot;, and foo.com can prove that it is privy to that information. foo.com shouldn&#x27;t get anything but a opaque identifier, and anything else it wants (my email, my name, my address) can be divulged through an API dedicated to this purpose.<p>The whole login problem was derailed because of <i>authorization</i> (&quot;site foo.com wants to access your contacts&quot;), which OAuth was originally designed for, was abused for authentication. But authorization is a completely orthogonal use case, and it&#x27;s a fairly limited compared to login; I authorize an app maybe once a month, but I login every day.<p>We don&#x27;t need or want Google or Twitter or any third-party authority to manage our identities.

This is a fine goal but...<p>I hate the imperative syntax. The Razor based Imperative syntax for creating Kendo components is god awful.

Until you start needing some of the edge cases and you will start to find missing documentation that exists in the imperative syntax documentation but not declarative. There are countless subtle differences just enough so that you may spend hours trying to fix a damn kendo grid.<p>MVVM Kendo: Kendo has a half baked solution for MVVM which does not compare to other open source solutions. You are better off with using a more standard open source solution where there is an actual community surrounding the development.<p>I used to keep a list of all of the bugs I had found upon using declarative MVVM kendo, but it&#x27;s been a long time and I will absolutely never work anywhere that uses Kendo again so I brain dumped all of my specific kendo knowledge.<p>When all things are considered, KendoUI trys to hold your hand very tightly, and it does a great job and spinning up complicated grids. When you want something that isn&#x27;t explicitly accounted for, or combine things in novel ways - you are going to be in a world of hurt.<p>UI Kits I like better:<p>I think you will be better off with any widely used UI kit.

History shows out that the more government spending and distribution of goods and services there is, the better the economic outlook.  Even amongst most developed countries today, the government accounts for around half of GDP <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_percentage_of_GDP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_spending#As_a_perce...</a>.<p>&#x27;Small government&#x27; is nice as a political philosophy, however it hasn&#x27;t been shown historically to be a great economic policy.<p>Not to mention, while right-wing politicians and economists argue for private enterprise, lower taxes, smaller government, less spending, etc..., they simultaneously use state institutions to their advantage.  In most economies governments fund research, education, they are responsible for building most infrastructure, funding transit, etc...  These things benefit us as a society, yet the same people who reap these benefits every single day argue against paying for them (ie. paying taxes).<p>The problem with left-wing economics is that they aren&#x27;t intuitive.  Right-wing economics is - it&#x27;s simple, and reminds people of budgeting at home.  The only problem is that when you study macroeconomics, you realize that it&#x27;s more about behaviour than about finance.  Government spending increases GDP, in most cases by more than the dollar amount spent.  Social nets increase entrepreneurial behaviour, and reducing poverty always yields social benefits.<p>> So yes, that does mean that it shouldn&#x27;t redistribute wealth, at least on the federal level.<p>No one would argue that the government should only build roads in rich cities.  Or only build hospitals in rich cities.  Yet creating infrastructure is a redistribution of wealth.  When the US government creates a new military base, they&#x27;re redistributing wealth.  When they give money to schools, they&#x27;re distributing wealth.<p>Yet for some reason we have it in our heads that &#x27;taking&#x27; taxes and then giving &#x27;cash&#x27; to others is wrong, but it&#x27;s OK when the government uses other means to redistribute wealth.<p>Anyhow, the point is, we see it as &#x27;fair&#x27; that we work hard and get paid.  That we &#x27;deserve&#x27; what we make.  That we did it &#x27;alone&#x27;.  The fact is, wealth cannot be created in a vacuum.  Whatever we do, we do because others helped us.  We&#x27;re more than happy to use the institutions created for us, but don&#x27;t want to share the rewards.  We see &#x27;fairness&#x27; as more important than prosperity.",1445572982

But those that do make it, even though they are fewer, tend to do better than their female counterparts in later life.<p>Kindergarten activities and society&#x27;s ideas of self discipline aren&#x27;t really the conditions human life evolved under. Maybe fighting and looking for action/excitement are the same qualities that make boys successful later (if it doesn&#x27;t kill or otherwise ruin them first).<p>Here is my theory (after hours of watching the discovery channel). You don&#x27;t need many males biologically speaking. So for males, it&#x27;s do or die from day one. Mostly it&#x27;s die, but there are a few winners that pass their genes on. Women, as long as they are fertile, don&#x27;t necessarily enter the same competition... they are the prizes.<p>Of course civilization doesn&#x27;t work very well with all the males running around trying to kill each other and breed all the women, so we have laws and religions and kindergartens and diversity training classes. Which kind of puts males (and females maybe to an extent) in a biologically uncomfortable position. Those that succeed in this unnatural environment are those that channel their natural impulses into the pathways society has set up. The poor disadvantaged souls that aren&#x27;t ready for kindergarten and wind up in prison for violent crimes? Well... they might have been leading the pack 20,000 years ago.",1445572803

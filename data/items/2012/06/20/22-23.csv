However, you are obviously right that the bigger the conference, the less constructive the overall discussion. This in a way corresponds to the aforementioned amount of readers targeted.

I think she doesnt give enough evidence for her conclusion that people dont provide satisfaction and relaxation  she only mentioned one story, and didnt describe any times when people were good  but at least she tries to base her decisions on evidence. And then at the end she says <i>perhaps</i> our solitude is just saving up energy for companionship  and then stops there, assuming that that first hypothesis is right (and concluding based on that assumption that being around people is worth it, after all). Where did all her logic go? She has given no evidence of any kind for that, unlike everything else she discussed before.

4139591,comment,4138143,4138143,5,0,DigitalSea,,,"Who cares if this is a PR stunt? It answers the question quite truthfully, they aren't hiding the fact they have a food stylist who cooks the ingredients in a different way, tactfully places the meat, condiments and salads for a good picture. It's a known fact that in every industry involving photography; clothes, food, beverages, cars, electronic products is altered via Photoshop. Perfect lighting and a great photographer are about 90% of the work and the last 10% is usually minor alterations as seen in the video.<p>Another reason that explains why the burgers look amazing in the advertising is because the food stylist has access to where ingredients are placed and what ingredients he uses. In McDonald's stores they just use whatever ingredients they have on hand and if you've ever worked at McDonald's or know someone else who has or does, then you'd probably know a lot of their salads are frozen/refrigerated compared to a food stylist who would have access to the freshest ingredients that haven't been frozen.<p>You could quite clearly see the food stylist laying out several pieces of cheese on a plate, several pickles and carefully placing where the sauces went. The meat looks bigger because it was lightly seared in a pan and most likely not ingestible. Everyone knows meat shrinks when you cook it and you can see the stylist cooking the patty in a pan, and then holding it on a George Foreman looking grill, making sure it browned evenly.<p>The bottom line is: nothing ever looks the same as it does in an advertisement and the fact that people still complain and bring this up amazes me.

Or rather, they do exist, but nearly one hundred percent of them are crackpots. I don't think this kind of project can change that, because I don't think lack of funding is what's holding these people back.<p>What's the problem? Well, doing real scientific research is <i>hard</i> and time-consuming. Just trying to catch up with what's already known in your field of choice takes a lot of time and effort, especially if you're unplugged from the community, and then taking it to the next level by actually discovering something new is far harder. The average PhD student works for several years, full time, before they do their first piece of truly worthwhile work, and in 99 percent of cases we're still not talking about anything significant enough to satisfy your average hobbyist with dreams of scientific glory. Also the average PhD student has access to a zillion things which a hobbyist doesn't, most importantly an advisor who understands the field and knows what approaches are likely to be worthwhile. So for a hobbyist-scientist, we're talking four to five years of <i>all your spare time</i> spent trying to produce one or two papers that probably won't make a big impact. Doesn't sound enticing.<p>Crackpots, of course, get to take a short cut. Crackpots get the thrill of being a Great Scientist Who Discovered Something Important without the tedious mess involved with actually learning the field and doing science.

There are a million ways of killing onself, and suicide occurred in India long before agricultural ""chemicals"" had been invented.<p>It's a common misconception that Indian farmer suicides are a result of the presence of multinational agricultural giants like Monsanto. However, if you look at the data (which I can't find right now, but it's probably available online), you'll see that Indian farmer suicides occur in spurts, usually when something happens that kills their crop (drought, bug infestation, etc.). The use of agricultural chemicals is just a misguided attempt on the part of the farmers to show the ""cause"" of their misfortunes. The real problem is the temperamental nature of Indian agriculture, which is unfortunately a much more complex target than big bad multinationals and thus conveniently ignored.<p>Another common misconception is that the sales of genetically modified crops have driven Indian farmer suicides. However, the last spike in suicides was in the late 90s, several years before Monsanto began selling GM crops in India.",1340231937

Look at the most basic  monopolies 101 example, Standard Oil: they kept gas prices uncompetitively high, harming customers. When a competitor opened a gas station they'd temporarily lower prices in neighbouring standard oil stations (subsidised by profits from the rest of the country), until that competitor went out of business.<p>You can argue that people should have paid more and bought from these competitors, but that undermines the whole economic argument for a free market (that it allows selfish actors who are interested only in their own profits to still allocate resources optimally). And no doubt you can pick some examples of standard oil being involved with government (any sufficiently large company in America does that one way or another), but there's no reason to believe they wouldn't have attained their monopoly position in a completely unregulated market.",1340231909

With that said, our visualization suite consists of both graphs made by cutting edge third party charting libraries as well as in-house custom plots.<p>On interactivity, three of our most interesting features are drill-down, dynamic real-time highlights and filtering, and global view synchronization.<p>Drill-down, or click-through, refers to the ability to look into any given presented data point to see where it came from. For instance, if you are plotting the number of medications taken by site, you can right-click on any point or bar in the chart and see exactly which patients make up that data point, what the medications were, and even what symptoms those patients were experiencing. The backing data may come from different tables, different databases, or even a different type of data store all together (such as a flat file or SAS data set).<p>Comprehend also supports dragging a highlight or filter onto any active report or visualization. Highlights can be generated by the user on the fly; anything from ""males over 60 years old"" to a custom R function is fair game. Filters are functionally equivalent except instead of highlighting data which matches the predicate, we eliminate data that does not.<p>The product also supports global applied state, which consists of highlights and filters, which is automatically applied to all active views. This makes it easy to look at the same subset of data in different views to help answer questions and identify trends. We provide other interactive features, such as intelligent tooltips, various exporting options and view transformations, but in my opinion these are the most interesting.<p>It's easy to confuse Comprehend as a general BI or visualization tool. Although we provide this functionality, the hard tech problem we solve is answering questions where the data lies in disparate data sources.<p>This high level of interactivity and ground-up support for multiple data stores provide value beyond default Excel charting.",1340231298

Both of them were introducing their own HTML extensions left and right. Each was free to implement the extensions the other introduced.<p>> They first tried to create a monopoly on browser market share. By bundling IE with Windows 98 as the default browser, they succeeded in gaining 90%+ of marketshare just by default, which pretty much destroyed Netscape overnight.<p>That's not correct. What destroyed Netscape was the fact that IE was a better browser. IE did a better job of implementing standard HTML, and it did a good job of implementing Netscape's non-standard HTML extensions, and it performed better.<p>It's easy to say Microsoft won by bundling, but if you look at sales numbers from before bundling, when the competition between IE and Netscape boxes on the shelves at Egghead and CompUSA and the like, you'll find that IE dominated. I don't remember the exact numbers, but I remember them being massively in IE's favor. (My employer had retail software for sale, so we subscribed to a report from a company that had an arrangement with all the major software retailers to get sales numbers, and they produced a nifty monthly report showing pretty much ever item available at those stores and how many units were sold every month.

However this is used for motion/action/movie recording. Unless Kuka improved the servoes and gears, I doubt it will produce much usable material. \nMy friend tried it with Kukas first and ended up using Stublis with modified gears.\n<a href=""http://www.rtleaders.com/de/broadcasting-automation/robokam-7/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rtleaders.com/de/broadcasting-automation/robokam-...</a><p>Nevertheless safety is still an issue.

So they use similar reasoning not just for cigarettes (and masturbating and TV for that matter), but all desire, all attachment.  And they are intellectually thorough about this: once you commit to this course, and look forward to the ceasing of all wants, you must release that desire also.<p>Does this work?  A Buddhist monk was measured to be the ""happiest person in the world"".  Though, even if you can measure happiness, it may be more due to meditation, rather than Buddhist philosophy. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Ricard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthieu_Ricard</a><p>But, to be clear, they don't actually advocate giving up things - just giving up the <i>desire</i>/attachment to things.  That's their ""middle way"", neither compulsive nor abstinent. (If I've misrepresented any of these, feel free to correct).",1340229670

Admittedly, there is always some gray area when it comes to Intellectual Property, but, in this case, the intern's behavior was just disgraceful.  Stealing is stealing.  Ever since reasonably priced alternatives (iTunes and Amazon) of non-drm content in flexible packaging (per song purchasing) became available - music listeners have no excuse for stealing music.<p>I.E. This might have been excusable behavior in 1997-2009, but starting January 6, 2009 (The day Apple removed DRM from iTunes), the rationale for stealing music effectively disappeared.<p>Now, Game of Thrones torrentors on the other hand....",1340229646

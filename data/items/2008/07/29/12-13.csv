That's why it's not a waste of time to watch TV, read forums, and play video games.  The number of ""brain hours"" per day is less than the number of hours your're going to be awake.  You have to fill that time with something; Twitter is just as good as anything.<p>Now if you're feeling creative, productive, and wide-awake, it would be a shame to waste those hours on something not creative.  Which is why I am closing this window right now.  There are a few libraries I want to write before the end of today :)",1217336391

I guess they could argue that some of the runtime performance moves to instantiation in the decorator approach.<p>Still, warn the new coders against it, but don't stone the guy. Let people explore. I'm probably one of the few people who didn't want decorators added at all (I think they're ugly and feel less pythonic than decorating after declaration), but I like seeing people experiment.",1217336342

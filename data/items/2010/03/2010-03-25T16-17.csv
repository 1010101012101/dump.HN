I <i>used</i> to believe it, mostly because it seems to be common wisdom.

1218797,comment,1218443,1218570,0,0,isleyaardvark,,,"Few of the examples you listed are arbitrary, in fact Crockford describes precisely why he chose them as conventions. In nearly all cases he came up with these conventions to help coders avoid common pitfalls due to unfortunate aspects of the JavaScript language.<p><pre><code>    function foo(){
       myGlobal = ""foo"";
    }

    var myGlobal;
</code></pre>
This is clear if you only have this one function, but with a large js file I know I'd rather not be searching through the code for global variables. That's also why ""Inner functions should follow the var statement"", it's an easy way to keep track of scope.<p><i>""Do not use _ (underbar) as the first character of a name. It is sometimes used to indicate privacy, but it does not actually provide privacy. ""</i>
<i>It's private because you weren't invited to use it, not because I have a bomb waiting for you.</i><p>No, it's private because it throws an error if you try to use it outside of the proper scope. From what I can tell about Python, for example, adding underbars enforces privacy, JavaScript doesn't.<p><i>""Global variables should be in all caps.""</i>
<i>umm, no. That convention is reserved for constants.</i><p>That convention <i>in other languages</i> is for constants. Crockford points out that js doesn't have constants. He also constantly points out the dangers of global variables, how you should minimize their use. The purpose of all caps is to give a visual cue that they're global, the purpose of all caps in other languages is to give a visual cue that they're constants.<p><i>""Each group of statements (except the default) should end with break, return, or throw. Do not fall through.""</i>
<i>Arbitrary. I think DRY is preferable when it's warranted.</i><p>Crockford used to think the same. He tells the story of a user who suggested fall-through should be flagged by JSLint. Crockford gave him a detailed response explaining that there was nothing wrong with fall-through. The user agreed, and included a bug report for JSLint in his response. Crockford found the bug in JSLint and it was caused by... fall-through.<p><i>""Avoid doing assignments in the condition part of if and while statements. ""</i>
<i>It's a legitimate convention if wrapped with an extra pair of parenthesis. Note that Mozilla's strict mode will honor this convention.</i><p>Crockford points out the problems you can run into doing that:<p>Is<p><pre><code>    if (a = b) {
</code></pre>
a correct statement? Or was<p><pre><code>    if (a == b) {
</code></pre>
intended?<p>It's easy enough to tell if you're the one who wrote it, but what happens to the poor sorry schlub who's trying to debug the code later on (especially if that schlub is you 6 months later)?",1269535593

In particular there is this paragraph:<p><i>One principle duct tape programmers understand well is that any kind of coding technique that’s even slightly complicated is going to doom your project. Duct tape programmers tend to avoid C++, templates, multiple inheritance, multithreading, COM, CORBA, and a host of other technologies that are all totally reasonable, when you think long and hard about them, but are, honestly, just a little bit too hard for the human brain.</i><p>Added: Spolsky is not claiming that these techniques take too much time. He is claiming that it is very hard to use these techniques to make a product that is reliable and robust.<p>My reading of Spolsky is that he is making the claim that is it a good idea to have programmers on your team who are very focussed on shipping product, and don't really care whether the technology being used is particularly advanced or popular. They just want to do whatever it takes to ship.<p>I think he's right; it's good to have these people around. Programmers love learning about new technologies and programming techniques, and when we learn about them we want to apply them. Our enthusiasm can push us to use technology that isn't really required for the problem at hand, and when that technology is difficult to use correctly, this can cause big problems. Having someone around keep you focussed on what matters - shipping a working product - is very helpful.",1269535114

I was in the closed beta for a computer game (friend was a dev), and one of the goals of the developers was to lower the barriers to entry for new players to get into the genre. Nearly universally, the self-described 'hardcore' players decried the changes as dumbing down the game and removing the skill barriers between new and old players. In fact, some of those changes were UI upgrades, like making the item shop easier to navigate. While that one was more generally accepted, there was still a vocal minority that thought that noobs being able to easily purchase the items they had earned would lower the competitive aspect of the game.<p>While there's often an initial loud and forceful resistance to change, it dies down as people get used to the new system, except for a few die-hards. In the example above, it took about two months for the community to come around and realize that removing some obvious pain points let the players focus more on strategy and whatnot. Of course, it helps that the new system is clearly superior to the old system. Microsoft Office's Ribbon, on the other hand, is not clearly superior, so people still bitch about it years after it was introduced.

Getting $10K for an in-the-flesh internship at a development shop is easily better value than $5K from the GSOC program for most people.<p>People who are good for open source are attracted to it naturally. They care about more than money. That's my whole point really.. that the best people in open source <i>aren't</i> motivated by cash, so why attract people who are?",1269533801

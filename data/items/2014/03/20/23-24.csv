I said that other models typically provide superior solutions if you can work it out right.<p>Original reply:<p>Yes, I have a lot of criticisms of it. I was talking to my son the other day about something and he gave me the supporting example that a charity in Africa found that if it gave away mosquito netting to poor moms to protect their babies from diseases carried by mosquitoes, they typically sold it. But if they sold the netting for 50 cents, which was half a day&#x27;s wages for these women, then proper use of the netting shot up from something like 10% to something like 80%.<p>Giving away things for free tends to undermine self esteem and self determination, tends to come with a lot of controlling conditions, and tends to be very poor quality. I left the soup kitchens as soon as I could in part because the food is terrible and it exposed me to concentrations of people who were often ill and actively smoking cigarettes next to me. Staying away from sick people and cigarette smoke and eating good quality food is part of how I stay out of the ER.<p>I could go on but I don&#x27;t really see much reason to. I have a lot of very practical reasons. It is not merely some kind of negative psychological reaction. It is a very well reasoned position, based in part on having done a lot of volunteer work when I was younger and a lot of reading about such topics.<p>I don&#x27;t think we should eliminate all charities but I do think that the more we can find other ways to solve problems, the better those solutions are likely to be. Charity tends to produce pretty bad solutions which keep people limping along and generally does not have a good track record of lifting people out of poverty.",1395359713

7439732,comment,7437493,7439271,4,0,ivansmf,,,"Hi - I figured you know what you&#x27;re doing based on the details you picked on. I suspect you&#x27;d have way more fun reading the raw logs, but that would make for a post that is incredibly hard to parse. I will try to figure out a venue for them.<p>It was 100M keys per loader, so 30x100M for the low latency cluster and 45x100M for the high latency cluster. I sized to keep running long enough to go over half dozen major compactions, not necessarily to eat storage space.<p>Most of the IO is sequential, which really makes no difference for our backend (sorry, I have to leave it at that). Read performance ends up affecting the performance when the system reaches its limits of pending compactions, which I limited in the config. I could probably get a higher number without it, but it looked more realistic to set limits and I&#x27;d not deploy a server without the limits.<p>I had to make the fsyncs more frequent, not less, to reduce the odds of an operation sitting behind a long flush. This was a counter-intuitive finding for me, but it makes sense considering Persistent Disks throttle both IO sizes and IOPS. We do that to make sure a noisy neighbouring VM won&#x27;t affect yours. So I turned on trickle_fsync and tuned the size of the maximum syncs to never have a slow flush, but a lot of smaller flushes.<p>Tuning the Java GC was for the same reason - I did not want long GC cycles. The settings I used were based on the guidance from Java memory ergonomics. The DataStax distribution has tips and hints in the cassandra-env.sh file itself, which I read it and followed through. I also read more about Java memory than I ever want to read again from various vendors. As the joke goes &quot;I did even the things that contradicted the other things&quot; before getting to the settings you saw.<p>I hope you appreciate the fact I set limits on some of the most dangerous knobs, for instance limiting the RPC server and using HSHA as opposed to unbounded sync.<p>I understand the limitations of the benchmark I used, and the limitations of the post. I tried to stay within recommended settings for all subsystems, have safe limits for everything I found dangerous, and I picked the workload because that is what our customers do. I don&#x27;t advocate one storage solution over another, we love everyone that buys our solutions :)<p>BTW, while we do not sell Cassandra as a service, we do sell Cloud SQL (<a href=""https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.google.com/cloud-sql/</a>). Maybe the sales guys will give me a cut :)<p>Sharing the config was more work, but I suspected I was going to learn something by doing it. Thank you for the feedback!<p>PS: sorry for the delay replying - Y Combinator says I am posting too much. I am not quite sure at what point I will hit my daily quota of replies.",1395359402

7439632,comment,7437940,7438681,11,0,Mz,,,"<i>I think the best solution is to make charity cool again... \nIt doesn&#x27;t matter if big problems are solved for profit or solved for charity. What matters is that they get solved.</i><p>I think a lot of problems can be solved using a for profit model. I think, overall, it tends to be for the best if you can find a for profit model that is viable for the problem in question. I think the problem is not that it is for profit, I think the problem is that some for profit models are just not well suited to solving certain problems.<p>This is an idea I have thought a great deal about. I have a serious medical condition. I have spent the last 13 years getting myself well when doctors claim it cannot be done. I have come to believe that one of the problems is that doctors make their money off of treating illness. They do not actually make their money off of keeping you well. The more your treatment drags out, the more money they make.<p>I have heard that in China, they put a doctor on retainer and only pay him when they are well. So doctors in China only make money if you are well. I do not know how accurate this is or how effective, but, as someone who is getting well in part by avoiding the medical establishment, I feel very strongly that our current &quot;health care system&quot; is very broken and one of the things wrong with it is not that it is monetized but how it is monetized.<p>I have thought long and hard about how to try to share information about what worked for me. Given the negative reception my story gets almost everywhere I go, it may not be possible to help anyone else. But one thing I am clear about: I do not want to be &quot;a consultant&quot; and monetize the information much the way doctors get paid. Doctors in the U.S. mostly trade short term gains for long term costs. I got well by trading long term gains for short term costs as much as I could. When doctors put people like me on strong drugs, the drugs have a long handout listing the horrible side effects. But then as people like me get sicker and sicker, it is blamed on our disorder, not on the drug side effects. I have no desire to join doctors in following this model that allows them to charge big bucks and claim credit for the short term improvements while blaming long term deterioration on my condition. I believe that is a failed system and I believe the way it is monetized is part of why it goes down like that.<p>I think charity also tends to fail. Think of the very negative connotation for the phrase &quot;charity case.&quot; I don&#x27;t think we help people that much when we first have to write them off as losers before we do anything for them. Given that I have been homeless for over two years and left the soup kitchens and most other homeless services as soon as I could, yeah, I think my opinion on that is informed and not merely pontification of an unclued privileged person trying to justify not giving money away.<p>I don&#x27;t have an answer. I mostly cannot get people to even engage me in discussion on the topic (of how I got well). But I agree much more with your statement about solving big problems and not caring if it is for profit or for charity than I do with your idea of making charity cool again. I do not really want charity. Charity has helped keep me alive but it is not going to get me off the street or restore me to a middle class lifestyle. I need to be taken seriously as a competent professional to achieve that. Being viewed as &quot;a charity case&quot; is the opposite of the professional respect and business connections I would prefer to achieve.",1395358215

3016740,comment,3016618,3016618,8,0,socratic,,,"What is the goal of startups attending these sorts of conferences (e.g., Disrupt, Demo, Launch)?<p>It seems like the answers could be publicity, funding, sales, networking, or hype.  <i>Publicity</i> doesn't make much sense because articles only usually discuss a few of the (hundreds of?) startups.  <i>Funding</i> doesn't make sense because if you're unfunded, why spend money to go to an expensive conference?  <i>Sales</i> doesn't make much sense because it's not a specific conference for the specific industry of the startup.  (Unless the startup sells services or software to other startups.)  For similar reasons, it's not clear to me why it is useful to <i>network</i> with other startups from arbitrary other areas.  (Incubators and advisors seem like they would give much better advice than other startups, for example.)  Is the goal just to get the startup's name in a list so that investors think things are going well (<i>hype</i>)?<p>Whenever one of these things happens, it feels like I'm missing out on something by not being part of it.

3016731,comment,3016618,3016618,46,0,spolsky,,,"Were you a battlefield company (presenting on stage) or just a ""startup alley"" company (presenting from a small table in the lobby)?<p>There's a huge difference. The battlefield companies DO get a lot of attention and, imho, it's a great way to launch (but I'm repeating myself - see <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/09/15.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2011/09/15.html</a>).<p>The startup alley companies have a lot of things going AGAINST them. Most importantly, they're not battlefield companies. That means that in most cases they were NOT chosen by the TechCrunch editors to present on stage. Now, I'm not saying that the TechCrunch editors are 100% great at picking interesting startups, but the bottom line is that it may be that you didn't get value out of Disrupt because your startup isn't the kind of startup that VCs and the press are interested in hearing about.<p>The one thing about these conferences that kind of sucks is that there will always be a bunch of startups that are desperate enough to get some attention that they'll go to the conference and pay for a table even if they can't present on stage, and these companies collectively form a kind of low-rent district with a faint whiff of despair, so that even if you have the greatest startup in the world, you'll almost be tainted by association with them.<p>There are some redeeming features:<p>* Buying a table is a cheap way to get into the conference... much cheaper than attending as  normal full-priced attendee.<p>* If you have a great idea there's still some chance of getting noticed. At Disrupt ONE of the Startup Alley companies is chosen to be a finalist in the competition.<p>* Some of the VCs who are at the conference looking for investment ideas WILL at least stop by your booth for a minute to see what you have to offer, so if you are really convinced that you have a great startup IF ONLY PEOPLE WOULD LOOK AT IT, this is your chance.<p>That said if you keep showing up at conferences and finding that nobody actually wants to hear about your startup, it may be time for a different idea.<p>Most people didn't let the Arringtongate crap distract them too much. Yes, it is incredibly obnoxious when the press decides that their petty dramas ARE the news, but for the most part the staff of TechCrunch up to and including Arrington did a good job of keeping the conference 95% focused on startups. They seemed to suck in a lot of attention with their soap opera bullshit, and then take all the negative part of that attention for themselves, leaving the startups with some positive attention. I certainly can say that none of the political stupidity in any way harmed us as a startup. (It may have helped... the fact that the winners of the show were all Arrington investments made it much easier to swallow the fact that we didn't win!)<p>FINALLY - it sounds like you went to the conference to ""absorb insight, meet visionaries and explore the highs and lows of startup culture, funding and innovation."" That's not a good reason to go to ANY conference, least of all Disrupt. As a startup, you can't afford the time or the money to hang around absorbing culture. Don't do ANYTHING without a GOAL. The goal of a conference like Disrupt (for startups) is to meet VCs and press. Nothing else. If that is not why you're there you are at the wrong place.",1316505003

Did I mention I love writing code?<p>I am going solo on my current project, so I'm having to do all the non-tech stuff (marketing, financing, sales, operations, customer support).  I <i>like</i> doing it, but I'd rather not.  My time is much better spent solving technical problems.<p>The non-tech stuff is equally hard and equally important.  I might not be the best BizDev guy, but I'm definitely not going to trust it to just anybody.<p>Based on my experience, you have to be the best BizDev person I've ever met.  That's actually not that high of a bar; most ""BizDev"" folks have no idea what hustle looks like.<p>Here's how I'd define that...<p>1) How well defined is your product?  How have you evaluated the product/market fit?  If you aren't regularly engaging with customers, you haven't even started yet.  I want to see significant customer-facing interaction on a regular basis.<p>2) How well have you thought out the marketing plan?  What distribution channels have you identified?  Have you created marketing collateral for those channels yet?  If not, get busy.<p>3) Where's your business plan?  Don't laugh; I'm serious.  Anybody that scoffs at a business plan is a fool (and they've probably never done one before, which is a very bad sign).  It's a litmus test that shows you have gone through the business planning process.  And it's actually quite informative for me to better understand how thoroughly you have thought through your idea.<p>4) Show me your financial projections.  These had better be rock solid.  If my accountant laughs when reading your financials, not good.<p>5) Tell me where you personally want to be in 3 years.  What are your life goals, your financial goals, etc?<p>6) Show me your mock-ups, prototypes, wireframes, etc.  You should already have these (sourced via crowdsourcing/outsourcing) and are actively iterating them as part of your conversation with customers.<p>7) You should have spent at least $5k of your own money on this project.  I don't care what you spent it on (conference fees, outsourcing, travel, etc).  I want to see you with some skin in the game.<p>I think that's a reasonable first draft list of things I'm looking for in a BizDev person.

That's about as big of a misunderstanding as thinking being able to predict the weather will allow you to force a sunny day tomorrow. Eric Ries has never claimed to be able to do the latter, and I was just pointing that out. But right up there with misunderstanding #1 about Lean (i.e., ""Lean means bootstrapped cheap right?"") has got to be this particular misunderstanding.<p>What I meant by jury is still out, is that we might find that the framework suggested in The Lean Startup actually increases success rates amongst startups in addition to being a model for revealing truth. Revealing truth faster will allow startups to extend their runway and if we find that most successful businesses only require X pivots on average before they start to profitable, we very well might see startups be able to accomplish these X pivots succeed where they may have followed a more traditional launch and pray model and achieved fewer than X pivots, running out of runway.<p>If it sounds like I'm trying to be negative about the book, I'm not.

Karl Marx himself acknowledges the importance of capitalism generating wealth like no system before it. The left has an issue with the unjust creation of wealth. In the case of <i>financial capital</i>, the right and the left have a great deal in common - both right and left agree these financial methods by which people became wealthy during the housing bubble at the cost of others was unjust. The left would go a step further and say that there are some forms of <i>productive capital</i> that result in the unjust creation of wealth, such as businesses that are heavily reliant on manual labor for ultra low wages.<p>For this reason, I think #OccupyWallStreet as a movement against unjust investment of financial capital really does have the capacity to unite elements of the left and right.",1316503455

There would be no large projects, no investment in future demand or longer term infrastructure, it would all be hand to mouth.<p>Also, in many cases that cash flow would eventually outgrow what a company or individual can productively deploy.

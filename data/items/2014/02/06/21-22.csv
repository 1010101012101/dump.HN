7193215,comment,7191958,7193192,1,0,oneeyedpigeon,,,"First of all, that&#x27;s a pretty big accusation to level at someone on public record: are you 100% certain that the graphic assets have been lifted pixel-for-pixel? Second, I agree with you on the legal point: it&#x27;s much easier to &#x27;protect&#x27; visual assets than it is a game mechanic. However, I dispute the fact that ripping off someone&#x27;s game mechanics is, somehow, more ethical; in both cases, you&#x27;re simply copying someone else&#x27;s work and passing it off as your own. Just because one is easier to define, and therefore protect, in law, doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not both pretty nasty ways of operating.",1391723983

7193198,comment,7183977,7186890,1,0,ackydoodles,,,"The problem with your reasoning is that you neglect the fact, as do almost all humans in technological societies, that easily 90% of the energy we consume is wasted. You are not to blame; when you have no firsthand experience of a thing, it is normal for one to be oblivious to its existence.<p>I have lived for many years within the energy budget provided by photovoltaics and the wind. It is possible to live well under such circumstances, and to be as technological as a city dweller, but first you have to eliminate the waste.<p>Take, for example, your houses and apartment buildings. They are so poorly constructed that the planet would be considerably better off, despite the waste, if we tore down every single last one of them and rebuilt them for longevity and energy efficiency.<p>A few buildings (maybe three in a city of 5 million people) are constructed well. They use (at the moment) ICF techniques and they are so well insulated that, even in the coldest days of January, the heating system can fail completely for over three days BEFORE ANYONE NOTICES that it is broken. They can use geothermal heating exclusively both winter and summer and provide complete comfort for 10% of the normal cost.<p>But you do not build your stuctures like this because energy efficiency is not a priority; money is the priority. The scumbag builders build shit buildings to maximize their profits; the scumbag realtors sell units to the ignorant masses for a fortune, and nothing changes.<p>What is wrong with humanity is that we are just too fucking stupid and far too much in love with ourselves to do the reasonable thing. We are crazy for money and it has become the arbiter of all success. Instead of killing off 90% of the species, we could begin by simply eliminating the 90% of our activity that is wilfully wasted and continue to live well, so long as the reduction in resource usage was not simply an excuse to increase our already ridiculous numbers.<p>So that is my alternative: stop being monsters. Otherwise I cast my vote for us all to die of a virus incubated in the backstreets of Shenzhen, and good riddance.",1391723785

Often, there are even multiple wireless routers in the same building, which can&#x27;t talk to each other except through the ISPs, which I find quite ridiculous.<p>So, in urban areas of the US at least, it really is just a matter of software.<p>Of course, a large scale wireless mesh network would probably be somewhat lacking in terms of performance, but we also still have wired connections to ISPs and could start setting up wired connections to each other. Peering with your neighbor (wirelessly or not) to share idle bandwidth shouldn&#x27;t make things any slower than they already are...<p>The problem of course is that everyone would have to use a compatible mesh protocol. There are several options for a mesh network protocol now, but I don&#x27;t know of any that scales well while remaining decentralized. Even if someone did come up with a good protocol now, considering how long the switch to IPv6 has been taking, I wouldn&#x27;t expect any switch away from IPv4 to happen very soon.",1391723511

While all of the i7 processors that contain IRIS graphics are very fast from a compute perspective, that&#x27;s not likely the reason they chose Intel&#x27;s premium line.<p>That is to say, the i7 is still a compromise in performance, but has the great advantage of having pretty good graphics (which they need for high def video streaming) without requiring a huge discreet GPU, which in turn allows for a very small overall package. I&#x27;m not saying that it&#x27;s a bad tradeoff, actually I recently bought a laptop that makes this exact tradeoff, but I think that it&#x27;s a little bit intentionally disingenuous to tout its top end CPU performance when it&#x27;s likely that this was only a secondary or tertiary factor for choosing this CPU.<p>I know it&#x27;s marketing, and of course they&#x27;re going to put i7 on the front of the tin because it&#x27;s associated with premium-ness. Just pointing out why in this case it&#x27;s kinda BS.<p>[1] Apple managed to convince Intel to integrate IRIS graphics into i5 branded processors for the late-2013 Macbook Pros, but it&#x27;s the only place that I&#x27;ve seen non i7 line processors with IRIS.",1391722558

I haven&#x27;t seen the high end price, but according to the spec sheet[2], the only difference is the CPU. The price difference here is $820. I couldn&#x27;t imagine the cost difference between a celeron and a mid-range i7 to be much more than $300. That same camera is $75 on amazon, and a similar looking speaker is $90, and I don&#x27;t imagine a RF remote is more than $15. That gets us to about $600, and leaves $220 for the management and support fee.<p>So the hardware cost checks out, but the question is if their support and software is worth $250 a year. They don&#x27;t do a good job explaining what goes into that though. Is the software a proprietary version of Chrome OS? Do you get to use priority servers instead of the normal hangout ones? Does that support fee cover all your chromeboxes, or is that per box? I feel a lot of the value proposition isn&#x27;t being well explained. If it&#x27;s amazing quality, and a great meeting experience, it can easily be worth it, but I&#x27;m not getting the sense of how the experience is better than if you bought the components yourself.

Similarly, there is often commonalities in dealing with the various Vs which may just be of different scale.<p>Would they argue that one shouldn&#x27;t be looking at using chef/ansible/salt, etc. as long as you&#x27;re dealing with a handful of machines?

When her joint 2001 tax return was filed in April 2002, she knew that on April 4, 2001, she had not yet told Mercury what options she was exercising. She also knew that on April 4, 2001, there had not yet been a written action by the Mercury Board of Directors that formally approved the executive loan to pay for the options. Abrams was aware that Mercury’s Stock Option Plan required notice of exercise and payment before a stock option could be considered exercised. She also knew that on April 4,\n2001, her stock option exercises had not met those requirements. By failing to meet the requirements of the Plan, Abrams endeavored to claim an exercise date on which the company’s stock price was lower than on later dates. This caused her to file a tax return and amended tax return that understated her wages and caused the IRS to assess an\nincorrect amount of tax for 2001, thereby obtaining a tax benefit for which she was not entitled.&quot;)<p>Basically, she said on her tax return that she had exercised her options on April 4, 2001, when not only had she not done that, but she hadn&#x27;t yet met the requirements for being able to exercise her options at that time. This is not being burned by some esoteric rule where she checked Box A when she should&#x27;ve checked Box B.

That was the problem with backdating: while the process itself was legal from an accounting standpoint, the fact that it was built on a fiction made it easy to cross the line into outright deception. The wikipedia article actually has a great sentence that captures the whole situation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_backdating"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Options_backdating</a> (&quot;To be legal, backdating must be clearly communicated to the company shareholders, properly reflected in earnings, and properly reflected in tax calculations.&quot;)",1391721832

I&#x27;ve got Evernote to index stuff and 1dollarscan to convert things that I can&#x27;t purchase in a compatible format. I&#x27;ve got a few thousand hours of music I like which I can stream to headphones to keep the noise of the world out.<p>That is the stuff tablets are really good at.

That became less useful when information was available on the network, but it has become useful again as the network information has become polluted and sometimes vanishes inexplicably.

JavaScript? Java? (Again: not a standard.)</i><p>I agree. I called out ActiveX and VBScript as <i>not</i> being examples of this because I thought somebody might bring them up if I didn&#x27;t. I don&#x27;t think those really contributed much to IE&#x27;s poor reputation on standards. You list some of the examples I was thinking of later on.<p>> <i>You also claim that Microsoft stopped working on IE6 when they obtained dominance: I directly touch on that in my expanded comments, pointing out that it makes more sense that Microsoft stopped working on IE when they ran into legal opposition and the project became demoralizing and dangerous. Microsoft does not have a history of simply not releasing updates to products they have dominated: their updates are at times problematic to others and sometimes even self-defeating, but something really weird happened with IE6--where there was only a single service pack release during a nearly five year hiatus from any form of update--that simply isn&#x27;t well-explained by their dominance.</i><p>I&#x27;m not sure if you think I claimed otherwise, but I didn&#x27;t. The reason for Microsoft&#x27;s stagnation wasn&#x27;t relevant to my point, so I didn&#x27;t address it. Remember: The purpose of my comment was not to slag Microsoft. The purpose of my comment was just to illustrate that making progress was not what got Microsoft its bad reputation for web standards.<p><i>Why</i> Microsoft did things is interesting (and I think you&#x27;re probably right), but it&#x27;s beside the point when we&#x27;re just asking &quot;What did Microsoft do?&quot;<p>> <i>Finally, now in this comment you talk about &quot;broke the standards&quot;: I would appreciate some citations and examples; the primary things I know that people like to argue about are issues with CSS and XSL/T that are entirely explained by &quot;pushing proto-standard&quot;... the IE box model being the prototypical example.</i><p>CSS was still newly finalized when IE released support, but I don&#x27;t believe there was ever a draft specifying the behavior IE used. Here&#x27;s a draft from a year before IE 3 that specifies the standard box model: <a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html#horiz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html#horiz</a><p>I can&#x27;t find any evidence that Microsoft had reason to believe the behavior they implemented was what would be in CSS. As far as I can determine, they simply diverged from the spec. Maybe they misread the spec, maybe they liked their model better and chose to ignore the CSS standard they had available to them — and I mean, hey, I liked their version better too — but the fact is that they just created a competing standard and were reluctant to adopt the real standard, and this caused people to feel that Microsoft had poor support for standards.",1391721692

What&#x27;s &quot;containerization&quot;? The name comes the LXC technology (Linux Containers), and the technique is also known as &quot;Lightweight Virtualization&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s why we recently launched Docker (<a href=""http://www.docker.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.docker.io/</a>), an Open Source tool enabling anyone to run those Linux Containers very easily. Containers boot 1000x faster than virtual machines; their disk and memory footprint are also much lower; and they work on virtually all current platforms (from physical servers to public cloud instances). We think that they are the future of virtualization, and will soon become ubiquitous.<p>Convinced? Then fork the repo on github (<a href=""https://github.com/dotcloud/docker"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dotcloud/docker</a>) and have a look at the code. Not convinced?

295013,comment,294896,294993,0,0,tstegart,,,"But a lot of the problems you mention, like ""cluttering"" and ""impossible to find anything"" are really problems with the App Store, not the apps. iTunes, after all, has millions of songs, and there doesn't seem to be a clutter problem there. Apple doesn't tell musicians, ""don't make crappy music,"" or ""you song is of limited musical appeal.""<p>The nefarious apps argument is not really valid, because the number of apps on the Apps Store has, or will very soon, exceed the number of things humans can keep track of anyways, so even if crap apps are eliminated, there will still be too many apps to keep track of.<p>This is really a problem of taste, and Apple has messed up here. Some people like silly apps, just like some people like really bad music. The solution is not to insert yourself into the middle and become an arbiter of taste, the solution is to make it easier for the crowd to sort the good from the bad and let each app appeal to its niche while not eliminating innovation or silliness.",1220551118

294993,comment,294896,294896,0,0,geuis,,,"I know its a contrary opinion to what most commenters will have, but I'm glad this app didn't get approved. Apple is apparently responding to the very frequent complaints of useless apps filling up the App Store. What we are seeing is a pendulum, where they swing back and forth with the policies for app acceptance until they settle somewhere in the middle that works best for everyone.<p>Like many other people, I kept my 1st gen iPhone jailbroken from the day I bought it. I absolutely loved Installer.app and the huge community of developers and their applications that I had access to. A lot of the apps in Installer.app were pretty worthless though, or had little utility. They frequently cluttered up the categories of things that I really wanted to review.<p>However, it was much harder for developers to create jailbroken apps than it is now with the official SDK. This caused the overall number of available apps to be much smaller than what we have available through the official channel. If Apple were to not attempt to manage all of the apps that people are submitting, it would quickly become nearly impossible to find anything useful. That would also open up the possibility of nefarious apps that are trying to get your personal info, etc.<p>However, so that I don't sound like a complete Apple flunky, I also admit the App Store on iTunes and on the iPhone itself has a lot to be desired. There are interface issues which annoy me (like navigating into an app description, going back to the category but being at the freaking top of the list instead of where the app appears in the list). They need to improve the App Store application itself. It would be really great if someone could write a <i>new</i> App Store as a 3rd party app that would interface and manage all of the apps you have access to. This most certainly could be done on the old jailbroken systems using something like Summerboard.",1220550135

However, I've been bitten in the past by quite a few restrictions in Make, but every time I look into the alternatives, I see very few similarities with which to make a comparison judgment, and it seems more practical to just stick with what I know and work around the flaws than to start from scratch with something else that may have just as many limitations as Make...",1220550010

The prediction for the roadmap is that we will see hundreds or even thousands of precessors integrated within the next ten ... fifteen years, e.g., 424 precessing elements per chip in 2017. The trend can be confirmed by looking at some ambitious high-end projects in multi-core and multi-processor development. For example, Rapport Inc. is shipping a chip with 256 processing elements on board and is developing a 1,024-core processor, however these are only 8-bit elements [281].<p>...<p>My bet is that we will see more specialized processors for different specific tasks.

294939,comment,294448,294448,0,0,RobGR,,,"I agree with ojbyrne's analysis of the numbers, that they seem less than advertised - although keep in mind that you can bill more than 8760 hours a year, especially on the internet where no one knows if you are a dog, or working on a project versus asleep, and you can bill the same hour multiple times if you get jobs that are similar.  I agree with bdr that this sounds like an ad for eLance.<p>But I think the idea of this article is a good one.  Someone who isn't weeks behind on all their deadlines (i.e., not me) should do a ""Freakonomics"" style analysis of some of these outsourcing sites.  If you sign up as a buyer, you can usually see some type of statistics about past jobs that sellers did.  If you could work with the people running the site you could probably get access to even more detailed analysis.<p>It would be interesting to know the average and median, as well as the top, monthly earnings for individuals on some of these sites.  The sites differ in volume and nature of work, and some may be more suited to different skills.<p>Is it possible to pull off a North American level salary via internet outsourcing ?  Does it require a secretary or wife to handle all the jobs and customer communications ?<p>I think this type of analysis has been done on ebay, but it would also be interesting to know the numbers for etsy.com.",1220547672

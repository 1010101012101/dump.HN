4088359,comment,4087116,4087844,3,0,rscale,,,"I don't have any special knowledge about Sortfolio or 37Signals, but it seems like Sortfolio is really inconvenient to divest.<p>It's big enough that shooting it in the head seems wasteful (and potentially disappointing to existing customers).  It's small enough that the opportunity cost of dealing with a sale quickly exceed the proceeds, and that sell-side advisors aren't going to be clamoring for the opportunity to help.  And on top of that it's an unusual business, so traditional small business brokers don't know what to do with it.<p>The demand side has similar size issues, where it's big enough to be a large purchase for a random individual, small enough that it's unlikely to attract attention from strategic buyers with an eye out for acquisition targets, and unusual enough that a purely financial acquisition is unlikely.<p>I feel like you're on the right track, but again it goes back to value.  The expected value from finding somebody to take over sortfolio, spin it into a separate entity, and then get 37s out of their ownership position probably isn't that much higher than the value they'd get from spending the time working on and marketing their key products and simply shooting sortfolio in the head at some pre-determined date.",1339257501

4088357,comment,4087811,4087811,11,0,vbtemp,,,"Interesting article, overall. Something occurred to me though:<p>> ""Dave expressed his enthusiasm for the material by asking a lot of very technical questions to the instructor. Largely, these questions seemed designed to show off his own knowledge, or to challenge the instructor. In other words, Dave was the jerk at the conference.""<p>This isn't a male-only phenomenon. Whether it's philosophy classes, psychology classes, or other courses with a significant female composition, this type of behavior is not entirely absent among females either (I have distinct memories of this in college). Granted it may be less common or less confrontational, but it exists, and let's also not forget most women will acknowledge that they can be quite vicious toward one another in office settings as well.<p>Think about the amount of women in law and medicine (I believe they are the majority at this point). Do you think hot-shot male lawyers or med students behave in significantly different ways than hot-shot male hackers? I doubt it. Men are men; I'm sure in the courtroom, at university, or at the medical conferences, or tech workshops, a minority of us men will exhibit this same ""jerk"" behavior (i.e., challenging the lecturer, asking questions to show off, etc...).  In summary, jerk behavior does not sufficiently or completely explain the lack of women in tech. It exists in most if not all professional fields, even ones in which women are coming to dominate (which, hey, I think is great).",1339257404

A client may pay 5000 USD for small modifications -- often only applicable to his own setup -- to a program that may only have cost 100 USD to buy in the first place or that he even downloaded free of charge.

4088332,comment,4087631,4088104,12,0,ovi256,,,"While there is internal debate among Orthodox leaders about evolution, with both for and against camps, the Eastern Orthodox Churches have never published official opinions on scientific matters, including evolution, implying such matters are of no concern. To understand the above statement, one must know several facts about the Eastern Orthodox (from now on EO) faith:<p>- In a phrase, the EO world is peer-to-peer. There is no leader, similar to the Pope. Each country's Church is autonomous (they use the term autocephalous), including in theological matters. When they meet, they meet as peers, and the Patriarch of Constantinople is recognized as the chairman of such meetings (primo inter pares, the first among peers or equals). The different Churches recognize each others' Orthodoxy, which stems from following the same theological principles, agreed some time ago during several Ecumenical Councils. Instead of EO Church, I should use EO Churches everywhere, and if I do not, it's a mistake.<p>- The EO are very conservative on issuing theological statements. This stems from the conflict and fragmentation that rash statements have caused in the past, which have included millenia-long strife with the Catholic Church and various groups regarded as sects or heretical splinter churches. It does not help that the last Ecumenical Council to be recognized as valid by all EO was the Council of Nicaea of 787. Yes, that is not a typo.<p>- The EO Churches regards material welfare with indifference, if not suspicion. They have strong ascetic traditions, at the extreme end ressembling nihilism, that underpin the faith and the recommended lifestyle. This attitude flows towards science as well. That is why we have not seen something similar to Islamic banking discussed among the EO. These concerns are so foreign, the EO faithful I've asked about similar things have been surprised I've thought faith could influence such a metter at all.<p>- In stark contrast with American Evangelicals, the EO rarely, if ever, seek to influence state law or to seek enforcement of religious principles. AFAIK, the EO opinion is that a sinful action stopped by another still is a sin commited.<p>- Evolution is not a hot issue in the EO countries. It looks to me like it's a hot issue only among the American Evangelicals, and the foreigners that share their faith.<p>TL;DR\nSo the Romanians that you have met were probably followers of dualism [1]: science can be incompatible with faith, and they exist in separate planes, which is a more complicated position than it looks, not dissimilar with doublethink. It would be wrong though to say this is the official EO position. For that to be true, dualism would have to be universal (or almost) among the EO faithful in all EO countries, and the next Council would have to ratify that position. That will not happen, IMO, before the heat death of this universe. Dualism is, AFAIK, popular among a minority, mostly the elderly faithful.<p>FWIW, You would have to search hard for a dualist EO scientist or engineer.<p>As for me, I'm a secular, not-very-observant, born EO, but I understand that Christian principles are foundational for European cultures, even in secular countries. My, was this a long reply. I felt the first statement would be hard to understand without its peculiar context.<p>Edits: lots of typos, improvements.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution#Eastern_Orthodox_Church"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theistic_evolution#Eastern_Orth...</a>",1339256796

These systems were bad at the sort of semantic ambiguities that you describe. Also they tended to give too literal translations.<p>The new generation like Google Translate are statistical systems. Semantic ambiguities actually are fairly easy to resolve using statistics. The basic idea is this: Google can use the entire Internet to check if ""Knives were ethical"" or ""Knives were efficient"" is a more common thing to say. Also Google tries to translate the largest possible phrase, so if there is already a translation of ""Knives were good"" in their corpus then the problem will never occur.<p>Of cause there will always cases where this fails, but you'd be surprised how well it works. At least that is not the main concern at the moment. Maybe ultimately you could have a UI where a human selects the best translation.

The few clients you worked with may have extremely focused needs, and what you've built for them has limited value outside of those handful of orgs.  <i>Finding</i> the other orgs that could also benefit from a similar service/product may simply be too much work (and it's not guaranteed to find anyone at all).<p>On top of that, some of what you've built may have been predicated on confidential information/processes which you can't replicate.

If the main point of salting is to make rainbow tables ineffective, a single DB-wide hash still does that. Presumably if a hacker gets a copy of your entire database, they still don't have a copy of your hashing function with that salt. So then they're reduced to brute force.<p>Something else that I just thought of is, if you're salting per user, where does that salt get stored? A secondary database?<p>..And then come to find out it's been discussed down thread. Oops.",1339254241

Toy Story 3 was an amazing success and pulled off being a very emotional film while being a comedy/adventure. I know many people who cried or nearly cried toward the end who are parents with kids leaving their childhood behind. The first several minutes of UP are amazingly melancholy. The ""dance"" in space from Wall-E is downright beautiful and Wall-E's devotion to the girl robot when she is broken is rather heartwarming.<p>Incidentally according to BoxOffice Mojo Wall-E made 521 Million dollars.",1339254208

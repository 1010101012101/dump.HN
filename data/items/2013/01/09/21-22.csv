My premiums go up by double digit percentages every year because ""costs"" keep increasing, but at the same time, insurers' profits go up by double digit percentages every year. It seems like this is simply a money transfer to health care executives.""<p>If they could compete across state lines, this would be different.  You also seem to leave out the government regulations in place, which many times hurts the consumer rather than helps (see: Obama care).<p>""The more private companies run our lives (especially something like healthcare), the more they will be able to dictate our choices (what we eat, risky behavior etc). Oh wait... corporations already do dictate what we eat, what sort of medicine we use, where we work, how we communicate, how we move around, what we wear...The only difference between corporate control and government control is that we actually have some say in how the government controls us because at the end of the day we control the government.""<p>So you are saying because all of the people here on HN and in the US that want MJ legalized, it's magically legalized?

5033796,comment,5030803,5033341,2,0,andolanra,,,"Type systems are, in essence, automated mathematical theorem provers designed to prevent certain classes of bugs.[1] The functional style is also a bug-reducer in that you can reason more accurately about the state of your program, because you have limited state-changing code to particular places. Certain language features like Lisp's restarts or garbage collection are bug-reducing because they give you concise ways of expressing features you might otherwise have had to implement by hand, and every line of code you write is another line for a bug to hide in.<p>Yes, testing is invaluable and should not be omitted. No, none of these are silver bullets that eliminate the need for testing. But it is false to say that ""...the <i>only</i> economically practical way to reduce bugs is to test thoroughly."" There are many ways to reduce bugs that can help alongside testing.<p>[1]: If you've only ever used C++ or Java, this sounds hilariously weak, but in languages like the ML, the type system prevents null pointer exceptions, and in Haskell, the type system goes further and separates effectful and non-effectful code to ensure you don't cause side effects where you don't expect. Even more powerful are languages like ATS, which give you compile-time type errors when you've forgotten to allocate space for a null terminator for strings.",1357768556

That, in and of itself, is a real problem. Ralph Lauren started his multibillion-dollar clothing empire as a door to door tie salesman. He built his business one store sale at a time. Why can't today's entrepreneurs in the clothing space start small and grow organically? Is a startup in the bra market <i>really</i> in need of tens of millions of dollars in order to hit necessary traction? Is rapid, overnight growth <i>really</i> the best way to build a clothing brand? All very reasonable inquiries.<p>That said -- and I say this as respectfully as possible -- you're applying 20/20 hindsight in many of your examples. Fact: many women in this country, perhaps even a majority, have bras that don't fit correctly. Fact: women's boobs are highly variable, and do not actually fit into the standard cup size / chest size system that we've been using for the last 50 years. (An algorithm may be an over-engineered way to approach this problem, but the current model is far from perfect). Fact: men's razors are ridiculously expensive, and the razor & blades model is ripe for disruption. Theory (perhaps more viable than you might think): curated boxes of goods may, indeed, drive lead-generation and discovery, opening up new markets for apparel and home furnishings businesses.<p>I don't think it's remotely fair to look at the present-day struggles of companies like Dollar Shave Club or Trunk Club and declare, ipso facto, that their business models are fundamentally unsound. Perhaps their business <i>operations</i> are unsound. Perhaps their business <i>strategies</i> are unsound. Perhaps even wildly so. But the addressable markets seem reasonable in both cases.<p>Finally, I think you're cherry picking some examples and using them to draw a larger condemnation of the whole system. If we're going to declare that the system is rotten, then we need to begin with a macro-level evaluation of the system.",1357767577

The real data woes are from high-throughput biological data such as gene expression and now sequencing, and that's a field that's crowded with tiny startups (and though my startup has great tools for this, surviving on pharma does not seem like a sustainable business model).<p>This other side of information management, clinical trials, is typically handled by Oracle's offerings in the area. However, I haven't heard many complaints about the data side of clinical trials, it's the actual patient accrual and patient handling that's typically expensive on clinical trials. That's not to say that Oracle has solved all the issues. As there are more trials with a bent towards personalized medicine, accruing the patients with the desired traits is going to get more difficult, and will require the participation and coordination of many many more different trial sites. Having additional trial sites is the real cost, as all the sites have to use exactly the same treatment and data collection protocols, and these protocols almost certainly differ from the hospital's or office's standard protocols. And trials also require the doctors to attend training sessions fro their particular data collection routines, even if they have previously learned similar techniques, which is extremely wasteful, but necessary without proper certification schemes. <i>These</i> are the areas that a forward thinking startup can really get ahead of Oracle, so even though I don't see much indication in this PR about it, hopefully Comprehend is thinking in that direction.<p>That said, typical Silicon Valley startups are woefully naive about healthcare (not necessarily a bad thing!!), and typical startups here underestimate the difficulty of working their way into long-standing relationships, and of changing practices in a field that is change-averse without proper evidence.  Additionally it can be extremely difficult to see the areas that can use improvement unless you've studied the terrain carefully, and by the time you've found pain points that you can address, you may have lost the helpful parts of naivete that let you look past all the myriad hurdles in the way of making progress.",1357766887

For example, if someone lives in a smaller town than there most likely will not be "" tech related meet ups"" or coworking spaces. For those people who live in a smaller area, finding freelance work will be quite a bit harder at the start. Because of this, I would suggest going directly to small/medium sized businesses and offering your services to them directly.<p>Do your homework first. Get online and find out what businesses don't have a website or have an old outdated website. Then put together a few pages of information that explains how a website can directly impact their business and how you are the person to get that done. You could also include additional services such as setting up social media accounts or getting Google Analytics set up etc. etc. Those wouldn't take too much time for you to do but they would add an increase in the value to what you can offer a business. Be sure to present your services as something that can help them sell more of their product.<p>After you finish a site ask the client to fill out a short customer satisfaction survey and ask if it's ok to use quotes from it on your personal website/portfolio. Also, ask your clients to refer you to other businesses if they think you did a good job.

(1: The existence of police harms private security; the existence of public schools harms private schools; the existence of the US army harms private mercenaries. 2: I should not be forced to pay for protecting someone who does not make an effort to protect themselves; I shouldn't be forced to subsidize teaching to anyone; I shouldn't pay for a war I didn't ask for).<p>I'm not sure why health care, which is sometimes (literally) a matter of life and death, and about which one has much less control than anything else, would not get a public option when schools do.

As such, it is more than just a way to configure an FPGA. It also provides integral operating system supports for FPGA designs, such as the ability for an FPGA design to read/write to the standard Linux file system.\n</code></pre>\nIf it supports partial-reconfiguration (which it looks like it does), then it could be a very handy tool. Why? Hardware is significantly faster than software. While Linux is running, the ability to spawn hardware at will would be great for many applications.<p>At UCSB, some of the research I did related to this very problem. What I was trying to do was have a Linux web server running on an FPGA that could dynamically reconfigure itself for different experiments. I ended up choosing a board that has an FPGA that communicates with a ARM processor. Decent size FPGAs were (and still are) expensive. For all the Linux overhead and my budget, a hybrid FPGA-processor platform turned out to be the better solution.

CPUs are massive ensembles of these which then run your program majorly sequentially.  GPUs/GPGPUs are smaller ensembles that can be configured better for specific tasks, resulting in better performance/power ratio.  At the other end of the scale is using HDLs to program the gates directly for the specific task at hand, which would offer best performance/power ratio.  The development process is however more involved.  In-between the last two is reconfigurable computing.<p>A MicroBlaze is just a regular CPU instantiated on an FPGA, most likely controlling other logic around it designed using HDLs -- HDLs portions taking over compute-intensive tasks while the CPU takes over (relatively) low-speed control logic.  A reconfigurable computing environment would try to make this more symmetric.<p>In my opinion, there is a continuum between more complex units (CPUs) that have a large number of logic gates and offer lots of features, and between less complex units (logic gates directly) offering very small functionality.  At the end of the day, it is all about finding the right architecture for this ""unit"", which may vary from application to application.<p>There is a lot of development going around these days for using OpenCL to program FPGAs directly.

It is a form of insurance that can be offered to all people aligned to an entity (employer, trust, association, etc) that removes the requirement for personal health questionnaires and medical assessments. The coverage you are offered by your employer as ""mandatory"" is guaranteed to you so long as you remain connected to the entity in question. There is a huge advantage to this and this is the reason it has become the de-facto standard for private insurance in Canada.<p>Of course the trade off is that the entity qualifying as a ""group"" needs to have an overwhelming percentage (often 100% if it is small) participating in the plan to mitigate the risk. Insurance breaks down if the only people buying it are high users.<p>That said, Private Insurance (i.e. not Group) is most certainly available and affordable in Canada. With private insurance however your rate is going to be based on your own individual heath assessment and life situation. That means that while your Extended Health rates might be lower, as a single 30 year old male your Life Insurance rates will be higher than a Female's, for instance.<p>Overall, for a majority of people Group Insurance has the benefit of spreading the fluctuating lifetime rates out so that they are predictable and more equitable. You aren't going to be 30 forever, after all.<p>People can and do waive their employer sponsored insurance all the time (with the exception of participation minimums). In addition, employers have started to introduce ""flexible"" group insurance that allows limited plan choices, based on fixed credits.<p>Not much beyond that is fixed in these group plans, so the variance in plans, costs, and overall benefit to the employee from one employer to the next can be huge. It is an effective enticement to have a good benefit plan, hence the interview question. There is also nothing at all forcing an employer to offer any extended coverage.<p>Personally, I think Canada is right on the money with regards to how we handle private health care services and insurance. Keep in mind that self management also presents a fair amount of improperly covered people. People are simply too ignorant of the situation. At least under an employer sponsored plan a trained professional is designing a plan that meets as many of the needs of the employer's workplace as they feel is required.",1357765718

Often they are of a lifestyle/why we didn't go big and why we are actually better than all the big IPOs changing the world nature. I mean this post boils down to ""I love my company (that I own, not that I work for)"". I think even if PG posted a blog so vapid, ""I love Ycombinator, I can picture working here for years"", even he would get a bit of fire. I certainly hope we aren't going to be seeing these vapid posts for a decade or more from 37S. You could randomly select a book from the self-help or business section of a bookstore, select a random page, and have a good chance of getting something more insightful than a standard weekly 37s post.<p>I seriously have nothing against them, I wish them more success even: just not success getting to the front page here because frankly they don't talk about interesting algorithms, technologies or business strategies. They are incredibly boring. No mobile, no Google glasses, no new computer game, no crafty actionable patio11 strategy, no raspberry pi hack, no programming language hack, no excellent presentation, no struggling story of success, no rejection and comeback, no scaling of servers, no clever command lines, no new SSH shell, no browser plugin, no investment philosophy, just ""I love my business"".<p>75% of their posts are simply not HN-worthy and there isn't a voting ring but there is probably a bunch of social contacts who are up voting this. Please just subscribe to their twitter or RSS because their weekly show here is frankly tragic and they should cut down to 1/4th as much and spend more time with their family.<p>Edit. Just to note I own a DHH book, so I will pay for the writing of this guy when it's actually worth it. I'm just saying this blog stuff isn't even worth free.",1357765317

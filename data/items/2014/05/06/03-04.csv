Many people end up self-managing their mood via drugs / alcohol (including depressants) even if they don&#x27;t have jobs that require heightened energy. I would think that self-medication is a better explanation for why so many, eg, politicians have drinking problems, than that the booze is necessary for them to be able to politick for 18 hours a day.",1399348708

It would be a lot easier to have cool demos on git if I had some kind of CS related &quot;solution&quot; there to show. I&#x27;m becoming flustered of only being able to do CRUD solutions etc. I want to be working with people of higher calibre and I feel I cannot gain that entry (eg. Google as the prime example) without CS or some kind of micro-focus of CS. I&#x27;m afraid of tackling some topic (eg. linear algebra) then being shut down because there are 100 other topics, or that half of linear doesn&#x27;t do me any good anyway, or I should be working on a meteor.js demo for practicality. Part of the frustration is that I don&#x27;t work around CS people and so I&#x27;m stagnating in an area I feel is important to me. I first got my job (co-op and stayed on) and worked under a great engineer and had a great time but he left about 8 months after-ward and ever since then it hasn&#x27;t been the same. I struggled since HS without a calculus/vectors course (and without foresight taht it would limit my entry into programs). I&#x27;ve since done some calculus but do not have credit. Should I just do it online, get the HS credit, and apply for CS at a uni? I think I will be taking too much of a step backward but I don&#x27;t see how else I can shake this limitation.",1399348633

If you read Rakesh&#x27;s Twitter recently, it&#x27;s pretty clear that something has gone dramatically and completely wrong -- and that is something that David alludes to in his blog post.<p>Obviously there can be no real clinical diagnosis of anything at all from a tweet stream, but what he&#x27;s been posting really does scream &quot;psychotic break&quot; or &quot;manic episode&quot;; when people say things in those kinds of states, they might not be grounded on any real beliefs of theirs at all.<p>In an ideal world, it would be nice if the next thing that happened to him was for him to be placed on medical leave, surrounded by a community that supports his recovery; upon his return, a statement like &quot;I&#x27;d lost my mind briefly, and obviously didn&#x27;t mean anything that I said&quot; could patch things up.  This might not be that world today: as a society, we&#x27;re remarkably bad at recognizing mental illness when it comes along, and we&#x27;re not so good at dealing with it even when we figure it out.<p>So, PayPal did what it had to.  A public firing is never a pretty thing, and maybe that was a little excessive, but I can certainly see where it comes from.  Either way, I hope that this guy gets the help he needs -- and preferably sooner, rather than later.",1399348531

My primary language is russian and I&#x27;m absolutely sure we should defragment the world. And I&#x27;m completely fine with using english as the only language for computing-related stuff. No, we haven&#x27;t &quot;defragmented enough already&quot;. Not even close.<p>You may not know that, but there already exist programming languages &quot;in russian&quot;. One is called 1С[1] and although probably unknown outside of russia, it&#x27;s very much used for bookkeeping apps (because of being part of quite useful proprietary app, not because it&#x27;s good). It&#x27;s basically VB with &quot;если&quot; instead of &quot;if&quot;. It proved to be totally useless and horrible. And there&#x27;re more examples like that.<p>Translating docs and such to other languages is always good, but not crucial. The reason is: you need to know english anyway, because there is and always will be useful stuff written in english, so people who are crying over absence of russian docs instead of learning english (unfortunately there are plenty of them) aren&#x27;t really worth paying attention, because they aren&#x27;t really in trouble, they are just lazy.<p>One more example of fragmentation on language basis might be Ruby community. Even now there&#x27;re two &quot;main&quot; mailing lists, one is japanese-only. Now it&#x27;s not really a problem, because all important stuff is doubled in english, but a while ago it was not so easy for people that don&#x27;t know japanese.<p>Why english and not chinese? Because english is fairly simple. Simple compared to russian, simple compared to chinese and japanese, simple compared to finnish. (Seriously, the only problem with it is the &quot;correct&quot; spelling is sometimes very far from how the word is pronounced). It might be not as expressive sometimes, but that&#x27;s a matter to reflect about for language-lovers, not a real problem.<p>Hieroglyphic writing systems are complicated. I don&#x27;t know chinese, but I do know japanese for some extent and the funny thing is even many native speakers cannot write properly in japanese… well, I know, many native english speakers cannot write properly as well, but for japanese it&#x27;s even worse, seriously. And to be fair: I absolutely love japanese typography. Phone entries and posters look so much better in japanese than in latin/cyrillics. But it <i>is</i> complicated.<p>Why not spanish? I don&#x27;t know. It would be fine to use spanish as &quot;the&quot; language, I guess. It just happened so the main language for computing is english. Let it be english. Fine.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D1%8F%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA_%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_1%D0%A1:%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B5"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%...</a>  (sorry, russian only)",1399347957

Focus on the target-rich environments like EC2 space, hosting providers, enterprises, etc.  You also can not scan any unassigned v4 space (admittedly getting smaller), multicast addresses, RFC1918, etc.  The usable pool of v4 is actually quite a bit smaller than 32 bits, and the interesting parts are even less.

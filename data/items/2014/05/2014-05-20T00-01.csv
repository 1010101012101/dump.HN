Sony uses the Zeiss lens as a selling point, but still can&#x27;t do the 4K resolution of the GoPro.<p>GoPro&#x27;s image quality is good enough for it not to be something that counts against it in almost any case. A quick look at some of the clips produced by GoPros will give enough evidence to convince most doubters.<p>GoPro usually wins because of a combination of things.<p>Firstly there is the form factor. Usually it is seen as a downside, but then you discover that the &quot;wide & short&quot; GoPro factor is the only one you can chest mount safely, and the only one you can helmet mount in the middle of a helmet. That&#x27;s usually enough to counter any &quot;form factor&quot; arguments (although I&#x27;d like to see a &quot;long narrow&quot; GoPro - there are some cases where it is better too).<p>Then there is the ecosystem. You can get GoPro mounts for <i>anything</i>. Most competing cameras sell adaptors, but then you often run into the form factor problem - the more common &quot;long narrow&quot; form factor doesn&#x27;t fit into the same space as &quot;wide short&quot;.<p>Then there&#x27;s the software. GoPro&#x27;s software isn&#x27;t fantastic, but it&#x27;s mostly ok. Most of the competitors have pretty bad software.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.digitalrev.com/article/gopro-hero-3-vs-sony/Njk3MDQ3MDg_A"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalrev.com/article/gopro-hero-3-vs-sony/Njk3M...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/08/31/personal-camcorder-pov-camera/2724163/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/personal/2013/08/31/perso...</a>",1400547229

What if these ships were designed so that nothing too awful would happen if they floated around in the middle of the ocean for awhile awaiting another ship with a human crew to perform repairs.  Or, maybe another drone ship or two to tow a broken one back to land?<p>My understanding of container shipping is that customers make SLA choices much akin to us Americans choosing between UPS Ground/2nd Day Air/Next Day, etc.  UPS uses these varied SLAs to smooth out its use of fleet capacity and for price discrimination.  Shippers operate transshipment ports as part of distribution networks much like the hub & spoke designs of the major airlines.  These ports have a bunch of shipping containers sitting around awaiting capacity.<p>Consider the needs of companies that must transport low-value, high weight/bulk cargo.  These companies likely already choose the &quot;UPS Ground&quot; equivalent for container shipping.  Due to low product value, inventory costs are low (in transit goods are inventory), so it&#x27;s probably less expensive to have buffers of goods in the supply chain than it is to pay for tight shipping SLAs.  Why should these companies care if the variance they experience in shipping duration is due to capacity constraints of manned-ships or that it took an extra two weeks to fix the ship upon which their cargo was in transit?",1400546764

I&#x27;ve used Ubuntu also and find Arch mostly an improvent.  One thing I miss from Ubuntu is the installation of (most) games under /usr/games, so when I want to play a game I can just ls /usr/games to see what is available, although I prefer that games go in a games directory in my home directory (I should just symlink stuff there, which is what I do for anything installed under wine).  I&#x27;ve also just kept a text file of applications that I&#x27;ve installed and am likely to forget about since I tend to install stuff that sounds cool to try it out from some casual mention on the web somewhere.  I prefer that my OS be as simple and understandable as possible and Arch makes that much easier (other than systemd, which is the source of most of the problems I&#x27;ve had with Arch).<p>More important to me than the OS is the details of my desktop setup, which is the same under any of the above: I run GNU screen in urxvt and ratpoison from screen.  That way, any output from applications launched from ratpoison goes to screen 0.  I make various aliases for things I use regularly, so e.g. e starts an editor in a new screen window.  I can use screen or ratpoison window splitting if I need to see multiple windows at once.  This is by far the least annoyance setup I have found on any OS.  There are menu apps that work with ratpoison, but I find the text file + command line + aliases method to be much less annoying than any app launcher I&#x27;ve used on any OS.",1400546398

SaaS is a bit different... this is just my opinion.)<p>I&#x27;d guess <i>most</i> of the time you <i>do</i> want to list at least some prices. My point was just that, while annoying, it&#x27;s not always wrong to make people call/email.<p>Sometimes the price indeed will vary and you want to make sure you understand what the client wants and that they understand what you&#x27;re offering them. And, either way, you want to start a dialogue. Enterprise products don&#x27;t generally sell themselves. If you have a product that will save a company hundreds of thousands of dollars, the challenge isn&#x27;t going to be whether it&#x27;s $199 or $299. It&#x27;s going to be, Do I believe it will work for me? Is my data safe? Is there an SLA? It&#x27;s likely a human will be needed to navigate the sales process. The point at which they&#x27;re asking, &quot;What&#x27;s it cost?&quot; might be the best place to insert someone. And if your product costs $10,000 a month, that&#x27;s probably doubly true. Not many people are just going to pop a credit card number into a Stripe form for a $10,000 buy.<p>Put another way, it&#x27;s entirely possible that the people you lose by not listing a price are easily outweighed by the deals you close by encouraging people to contact you. People shopping for products based mostly on price are probably not great candidates for your &quot;expensive&quot; enterprise product anyway.<p>EDIT: patio11 has a post about enterprise sales that, as usual, is very insightful: <a href=""https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterprise_sales"" rel=""nofollow"">https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/enterpris...</a>",1400545867

There&#x27;s no provision for voting among subscribers or moderators in the event of perceived abuse.<p>• The generally recognized remedy is to create an alternate subreddit with different mods.

If you tell someone how to shine their shoes, be prepared to tell them how to shine their shoes <i>every single day</i>.<p>Again, this is an a military context where orders flow downhill, but the same applies in other areas of business. An experienced manager knows where they need to set the boundaries within which their staff operate, with as much autonomy and initiative as possible. An inexperienced manager doesn&#x27;t understand how to balance this equation.<p>PS if anyone has a better formulation of the above, please share =D",1400544172

Because &quot;managers&quot; tend to ask this when neither scope nor current state of the project are visible, and are then getting offended when one points out to them that it&#x27;s an impossible question. They then usually proceed to ask you to just make something, clearly demonstrating that they don&#x27;t want to improve the disaster state of the project or care for your opinion in any shape or form, but instead prefer some randomly made up number.<p>So whenever I hear this question in that very particular tone, I already plan my exit strategy because I know it&#x27;s going to be a train wreck.",1400544159

7770551,comment,7770547,7770547,1,0,decimusphostle,,,"Example/Fabricated scenarios below<p>A simplistic view of the old scenario:\nAssume something like Google Analytics that tracks different websites traffic data. Previously a user could filter various website stats(unique users, time spent by users on a site, number of pageviews by user et al), by gender, by age, by device. So for example, interact with the data using a filter that picks all males(3), that are in an age bucket(assume 5 different age buckets) and that use a specific device category(assume 15 different device catgories). Here the cartesian product becomes 3(gender) X 5(age buckets) X 15 which would make it a maximum of 225 data-points per day, per website that is tracked.<p>And now the new scenario:\nBesides the number of dimensions going up i.e. more multipliers in the cartesian product above, the way a filter works is being tweaked as well. So previously where it was an AND across different dimensions(eg. all males AND 25-34 AND Windows Tablet users), now it is an AND between dimensions and an OR within a dimension(eg. all males AND [25-34 OR 35-44 OR 45-54] AND [Windows Tablet OR Windows Desktop] AND [Some fourth dimension option 1 OR Some fourth dimension option 2]... ). This makes it a combinatorial explosion i.e. its roughly 3! * 5! * 15! (even for the old scheme).",1400544040

Parents will therefore observe and learn from other parents and their own research for healthier foods, better education tracks, both leadership and teamwork development activities, and whatever else we are convinced will help.<p>That drive then gets co-mingled with the need for acceptance and competitiveness (also evolution-based). The soccer mom satisfies all those drives concurrently: Improved survival rate for offspring, need for acceptance by a group, competitiveness for resources.<p>Thanks to evolution, we are pretty much spring-loaded to drive ourselves crazy busy in our 21st century world.",1400544029

Any idiot, or even a dumb lump of wood, can float through the water.<p>Not all that long ago:  rowing through a local harbor (a transport mode in which one faces sternwards and periodically checks over the shoulder for hazards) I managed to spot a large timber likely broken from a pier.  Perhaps 0.3-0.6 meters across and 7-8 meters long, with an iron spike or bolt some 30 cm long protruding from one end.  I passed only 3-4 meters from it.  A week or so later another boat in our fleet struck a piece of driftwood and suffered a hull puncture (fortunately just above waterline).<p>Timber, lumber, telephone poles, and other hazards are frequent in water.

7770547,story,,,3,2,decimusphostle,"Ask HN: designing for interactive querying of large-scale high dimensional data",,"Hello Folks,<p>I am looking to get some inputs on architectural design on data storage and processing for something new I am working on.<p>I have large scale datasets (read a few hundred TB) which are used to generate data to power analytics. For the most part the analytics are usually data aggregations along different dimensions which are computed in an offline fashion (think Hive/Pig/Hadoop) and then fed-into/stored in an RDBMS or an in-memory data-store. This allows for fairly low-latency/highly responsive &#x27;online interactions&#x27; either via a web-page or an API.<p>However the new features that are being contemplated involves allowing users to slice and dice the data along various new dimensions. Previously since the dimensionality was low, the batch jobs would compute rollups of the cartesian products of various combinations of these dimensions. The &#x27;online interactions&#x27; could then be reduced to a mere lookup operation. This no longer seems viable with increased dimensionality and high cardinality.<p>So to get to the question, does anyone have any suggestions on new/interesting data architectures/data models/solutions that would be suited for slicing and dicing large-scale datasets along different dimensions while keep interactivity high/latencies low.<p>Looking forward to hearing from the resident data gurus. TIA.<p>PS:<p>1) HN n00b here. Apologies if I am doing anything wrong.\n2) In the comments, there is an example provided (here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7770551).",1400544014

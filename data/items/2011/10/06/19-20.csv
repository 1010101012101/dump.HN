Suppose that you are somewhere between the center of the Earth and the Earth's surface, say at x meters from the center. Then you can divide the Earth into two pieces: one smaller ball of radius x below you, and a shell with inner radius x and outer radius R ""above you"".<p>If you are inside or at the inner surface of a spherical shell, then the gravity from all the atoms in the shell is pulling at you in all directions. Now it so happens that all these little pulls exactly cancel each other out. This can be shown with Gauss' law. [Does anybody know an intuitive proof of this?]<p>So effectively only the inner ball of radius x counts. Now the question is whether this ball has bigger or smaller gravity than standing on the Earth's surface. It's not completely clear that the gravity is smaller because the density of the smaller ball could be different. If we assume that the density of the Earth is roughly uniform however, then it is clear that the gravity inside the Earth is lower than on its surface.<p>The precise condition for the gravity being lower at height x is that x/R < a/b where a is the average density of the of the Earth and b is the average density of the inner ball.",1317930864

3081375,comment,3079943,3080907,7,0,saurik,,,"Well, then you are wrong. @JZdziarski, aka Jonathan Zdziarski, aka NerveGas, is a former member of the ""iPhone Dev Team"", a group (which I am currently part of) that focuses on ""jailbreaking"" the iPhone (removing the restrictions on its usage and allowing third party software to run on it).<p>Let's put it this way: it is absurd to believe that the iPhone's filesystem is encrypted with the PIN number. When the phone turns on, it is already booted up, and applications like MobileMail, Skype, and Latitude are already in the background running with your data. You can receive text messages and phone calls, which are stored as notifications and in the appropriate databases: you don't need to unlock it first.<p>Meanwhile, none of the jailbreaking tools (which often operate while the phone is in ""DFU"" mode, after it has been rebooted and without any other human interaction) require you to type in your PIN, yet make tons of filesystem modifications to both partitions (the system one with the firmware from Apple, and the user partition with the data for each user), which should be a pretty obvious clue that you don't need anything from the user to get access to any of that data.<p>Instead, all of the data is simply encrypted with a key derived from the device, which therefore means that all you need is ""virtually any exploit"" on the device, whether it be userland (send a fancy SMS message to the device which crashes CommCenter or SpringBoard) or bootloader (attacking it over USB in DFU mode, stealing the keys directly; something we currently can do for all Apple devies but the iPad 2), in order to get access to the personal data (even stuff you recently deleted, of course, due to how filesystems work) which is on it.",1317930743

And the potential is definitely the lowest at the center of the Earth. Otherwise clocks would run the slowest far out in intergalactic space where there's practically no gravity, but that's not the case.",1317930722

3081188,comment,3080068,3080990,3,0,mahyarm,,,"When your trying to loose weight, finding if there is anything else that might be making it hard can be helpful. Taking a blood test and finding out you have iron problems could literally save your life.  4 Hour Body kind of drills regular testing to see how your body is doing, and those accurate tests can be a wake up call. Seeing 30% body fat from a DXA scan surprised me a bit, since I estimated I was around 25%  At the very least do it once or twice if you've never had a comprehensive blood test and a DXA scan to see where you are now and possibly catch things you've never tested for even once.<p>If your the typical fat american too, pre-diabetes and heart attacks happen to 20-somethings too.  It's estimated in about a decade from now, %50 of the US population will be diabetic/pre-diabetic.  Cancer can occur also, I know people who've died of cancer in their 30s, and pretty much the only way to somewhat avoid/'cure' cancer is the earliest possible detection, and that's no where near foolproof even then.<p>Weight gain can sneak up on you too even if your not doing too much that's different in your diet and exercise.  I'm 25 and I'm starting to thin out in my hair region.  Aging can catch up to you quicker than you think and if you have health insurance and an income, taking your health seriously and spending money on things like these can really reap benefits in the future.",1317927856

He's taken each of the things we all think about Steve Jobs and presented a different perspective. I don't agree with the absolute manner in which they're stated, but that's sometimes the nature of writing. No one likes to read writing that is as firm as pudding. It's boring and doesn't challenge the reader.<p>If you didn't walk away from that list wondering whether you could do things Steve Jobs did, then Horace failed in his intention, which was, I think, to inspire.",1317927724

While there are some (rare) natural sources of hydrogen, it's usually made artificially, which takes energy. The energy cost in production is therefore more than the gain in burning it.""<p>That is, however, moot, since hydrogen fusion turns hydrogen into helium. (Note that there was nothing in the article showing a detectable trace of helium trace; that being a key data point in the Fleischmann and Pons paper which was eventually tracked down to coming from another lab in the same building.)<p>Fusion consumes hydrogen, and gives off a lot more energy than needed to disassociate hydrogen from water. This hydrogen can then be used as feed for the fusion step.",1317927665

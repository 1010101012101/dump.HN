There is at most an order of magnitude difference between RoR and reasonable alternatives (php, python, etc.), and realistacally the difference is closer to a factor of 3.  This might sound important, but there is bigger fish to fry  when talking about performance.  All of the above are dead slow, 3-4 orders of magnitude slower than optimal C implementation.<p>In a typical web app, HTTP optimization and doing O(1) queries rather O(n^2) per page is where performance lies.  You can develop web apps quickly these days, and the code can be clean, but you end up going from Palo Alto to Menlo Park through Paris.  Sure, a supersonic plane can do that route quicker than a handicapped turtle, but the trick is not going through Paris altogether.  RoR makes rewring the code to avoid the Paris trip easy, fast and resulting code remains reasonably readable.  And that's the holy grail.<p>Having said that, that 3x performance boost to RoR would sure be nice, and would put more areas of our application into ""Roundtrip through Paris OK"" category.",1182988534

In other words if you can get a few climbers using the site (and they like it) they should pass the info about your site to other climbers.  Or think of how most climbers use the internet - what sites do they use - that's another source of marketing ideas (think cross promotions). Have you tried to post information about your site on relevant blog/forum sites?",1182988292

The point is making money, and when you're that small, the whims of investors can wipe you right out.  Another reason Google doesn't split its stock.",1182986376

People give up their family and friends to move to Silicon Valley, and it would mean people here would have to move to Paris or Stockholm or London. Instead of one Silicon Valley, Europe will have pockets of excellence in different cities.""

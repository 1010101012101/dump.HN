That may or may not be true, but it's helpful to avoid spending way too much time on any particular game. Aim for the ending credits<p>While I agree that side quests usually are waste, what is the purpose of your playing? Is it because it's fun or because you have to finish? One could argue that the main quest is also a form of side quest and only for losers without better things to do...",1318679809

Our economic system of moving capital and wealth creation is now dependent on being convinced to want things we don't need, and shuffling around the systems of credit we created for that system. It used to be about creating value- mostly having to do with real things that fulfilled basic human needs, and now that the market's power isn't based on that, credit default swaps are what we come up with. It's a logical conclusion of a system that only has the principal of growth behind it.<p>Obviously our market-based capitalistic system is the only viable way to efficiently move capital around right now, but you can't blame someone for being unhappy with the underlying message that growth is the only way forward, forever. Some people would argue that we've already reached the peak of the curve in the first world.",1318678720

It might be me scapegoating, but many times I find that it is because there is a lack of documentation that I spend hours on hours trying to figure something out.<p>Debugging on Windows, is a prime example. If you take someone from the normal Visual Studio give give them a PDB file, the compiled executable, limited / no source code, a crash report and a minidump, they're going to be stumped looking on the internet for some resources and instructions on how to debug the program.<p>Others include debugging in general, making the switch to and working in a *NIX environment (ie. sans IDE) from Windows, adding functionality to a large enterprise application that doesn't have comments or documentation (so essentially you're stuck for 3 hours trying to find this interface to that will execute a command), and so on.",1318678628

But, for trust to exist, both sides need to be transparent and upfront throughout the development process.<p>2. One area that's always a little tricky is scope management. Make sure both sides agree what exactly is included in the scope of work, and what is not.<p>3. Working iteratively helps. Set specific milestones and sub-goals and move along towards the final product. This way, both sides will clearly know the progress, and can make tweaks and changes along the way depending on how things change. Software always evolves.<p>4. As for money - I would personally avoid a flat fee based project unless the scope is literally set-in stone (i.e. outcome is clearly quantifiable). Hourly billing rate coupled with these milestones should work well for both sides.<p>5. Post development support - this is again a tricky area. Be clear on what kind of post development support is needed - and its associated cost (e.g. dealing with bugs, minor feature tweaks).<p>My two cents!",1318678292

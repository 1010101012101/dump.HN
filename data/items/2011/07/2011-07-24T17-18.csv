If i tag someone in a picture, then clearly they should be able to see that picture (i mean they were there when it was taken so there should be no problem with that).  Extending this to the album level makes some sense because presumably everything in an album is related to a particular event (so that person who was tagged would have been there for all of that).<p>That being said there probably just needs to be better messaging on this so that users understand what exactly it means to tag someone.",1311530302

The USSR banned lobotomies in 1950, while in the USA it was banned... never (though some states individually did). In fact the USSR was the first major country to ban lobotomies. Lobotomies legally happen even today in the USA, though there's no longer the epidemic of wanton misuse.<p>I just say this because it's easy to get into the rut where anything the Soviet Union did was bad and everything the USA did was good. There's no reason per se to expect Soviet doctors to be particularly evil compared to American ones. Which isn't to justify the many many evil things the Soviet state did perpetrate.",1311528800

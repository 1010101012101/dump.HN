Hell, even I've done some of that talking as I've been there recently too.<p>The part at the end where he says they will listen is huge. Never underestimate how much someone simply listening can really help. Also, talking to a sympathetic stranger is often more helpful or even easier than talking to someone you know.<p>I always wondered why so many people around here get to feeling this way and I've narrowed it down to a few things. First, startups are hard, they're often lonely, and burnout can creep up on you without you noticing. Burnout can really make you feel worthless. Then there are those who feel inadequate because they're reading all these stories about successful and smart people solving hard problems and making it big while they feel small, stupid, and inconsequential. There's a strong success bias in the submissions here and other places people like us peruse which can lead to strong feelings of worthlessness and self doubt.<p>I've been there and I understand so well all of these things. I often wish I had a clone that just repeated what I tell myself whenever my negative voice starts nagging: Baby steps, you can't know it all or be it all and you certainly can't conquer the world in a week. No matter what anyone else is saying or doing out there, in the end we're all human, we're all going through the same things and we all feel the same way at one point or another.

3349111,comment,3337851,3338488,1,0,forgotusername,,,"My apologies, I intentionally try to make terse replies to keep S/N as high as possible, often people will attempt to highlight the same problem they have from multiple angles. In any case, my reply above was unsatisfactory, and that was most likely due to my alcohol intake at the time (on a revelry weekend with a friend in the middle of the Baltic). :-)<p>I'll attempt to reply again, and address each of your points. The initial 'suspicion' is largely based on how heavily NaCl has been getting pushed in recent times, it is of strategic importance to the company somehow, and that is what interests me. Whether or not my opinion turns out to be correct or not, largely to me is immaterial, it's just sufficient that it is possible for some strategy involving NaCl to result in an endgame where vendors competing in the platforms space suddenly find themselves with a fundamentally compelling competitor that they can't easily fight against.<p>As for why there is a conspiratorial tone to the article, well, that's simply because I do not trust the company in the long term (as stated somewhere in the comments).<p>On to your specific replies:<p>> How is that related to VP8?<p>NaCl may well be a vaguely open platform for the time being, but in the long term, and crucially, as it gathers mass acceptance, it is also a platform on which the better resourced players in various ongoing wars can easily be victorious, and that is where the video connection appears.<p>Video decoding is a natural use case for NaCl (fast graphics output, fast network input, efficient on CPU), I'd be dearly surprised if within 2 years of its mass deployment, <i>some</i> video vendor, <i>somewhere</i>, decided to tie their tweaked h.264-alike together with some crypto code and market it as a ""secure content delivery platform"", in a similar vein to the kind of capabilities (much loved by content providers) available in Flash today (RTMPE).<p>It's not a question of fear mongering, it is a question of whether or not it is technically possible, and if so, whether some company, somewhere would be willing to pay for it. In the DRM'd video case, I believe the answer here is an unquestionable yes.<p>For another perspective, BBC.co.uk only recently switched to Flash for the majority of their content, not because it is somehow technically superior to RealPlayer (their previous choice), but most likely owing to whatever commercial agreements between the two companies finally expired. Faced with a well resourced salesman and a proprietary video technology, guaranteed agreements like this will appear in the future given a suitable platform for the technology implementation.<p>The (not too far fetched, I believe, and certainly not ""fantastically unsupported"") conclusion is that if a fast platform for networking/graphics powered by binary blobs becomes widely deployed, it will likely be used to close up or at least occlude the openness of content on at least a few of the larger sites.<p>> Here you are again implying that somehow the introduction of NaCl will block us from ""our data"".<p>This follows in a similar vein to the previous answer: given a technology, you can be assured someone will make use of it in some arbitrarily stupid/inconvenient way. Banks already proved their ridiculous approaches to security in the 00's by wrapping their login processes up in ActiveX controls. I will happily put large sums of money on this reappearing if NaCl or a similar technology gains widespread deployment (many banks to this day still insist on Java).<p>> What is the difference between writing [...] that runs in NaCl.<p>> What platform easily runs on all devices? How does NaCl remove the ability to use any others?<p>I actually did write the answer to this previously. Once a platform gains critical mass and gets deployed everywhere (especially because the controlling company has easy access to a huge audience to which to sell it), and that platform is controlled by a single vendor, you may suddenly find yourself in the undesirable situation of being forced to use that vendor in order to reach your customers (or even before your customers will buy from you!). Given the privileged position of that vendor, you can only pray to your deities the vendor never chooses to compete in your problem space, as inevitably they are in a much better position to extend the platform as they desire to make it much more compelling or economical for 3rd parties to use their solution, rather than yours.<p>This has happened repeatedly in a million different fields, not least there still exists a huge number of corporations who won't touch anything that doesn't run on Microsoft, or at least talk to Active Directory. Is it so far fetched to imagine a world where a company won't touch your small company's solution because it doesn't speak Google Authentication or Google Contacts API?<p>There are a million Microsoft comparisons to be made here. Already, in the right light, you could consider Google's approach to advertising their products as abusive. By dropping a single link (at a cost of near zero) on their front page, over half the Internet is likely to see that advertisement at least once a day.<p>It bares little effort to make comparisons to a time when Microsoft had a dominant technology base and range of products that allowed them to almost force Netscape off the market. A little word in the ears of their sales channel guys (Google home page) a little bundling here (""get Chrome with Google Earth today!""), and a little integration there (""now seemlessly switch to Earth view via maps API.. no code changes required!""), and competing browsers might find themselves increasingly impotent.   [Note, I used as an example here Google Earth as being the thing promoted unfairly, at the disadvantage of other mapping providers, however the text speaks about browsers.. just make up some example of your own, it's not hard]<p>--<p>To claim this is ""just another technology"" is as if to claim around the time NT was shipping that Win32 was ""just another bundle of APIs"". You totally ignore the positioning of the company behind those APIs, the company's long term goals, and totally ignore the company survival instincts, as the profits of each market they enter slowly reaches plateau, and their need to expand yet more in the name of maintaining shareholder yields.<p>If you'd like, I am happy to reply further to your other comment, but already this one has taken nearly half an hour.",1323808186

Large organizations can put something in place because the person who has to fend off the anger (front line) is far removed from the person at 50k feet who thought up the policy.<p>There is also a lack of empathy. In a previous business I owned I did all the jobs (ran equipment, worked sales, counter work the whole thing). So I had empathy for the people doing those jobs. I knew what it was like to stand and deal with an angry customer. But the people that I hired had never done any of those jobs in many cases (they had only managed). As a result they didn't have empathy and made all sorts of jobsian ""just do it"" policies and rules.<p>Some things people do though make you laugh and there is no ""information ... in some policy book"" for every situation.

The issue of checking in code comes when you want to add an ""Enter Fullscreen"" menu item, which requires a tiny bit of code to make sure you don't call ""toggleFullscreen:"" on a window that doesn't know about it (or display the menu item on an OS where it will do nothing).<p>Still. It's pretty basic.<p>(As for the window manager supporting it, some apps really shouldn't be fullscreen - Address Book, I'm looking at you - so having an easy opt-in/out mechanism seems pretty necessary on the application side.)",1323807599

It will change. It might <i>feel</i> like things are never going to get better, but they will. It might <i>feel</i> like you're never going to feel better, but you will. You just have to hold tight to that fact, and trust it, even if it seems impossible. Then, six months or a year or three years from now, you'll be so glad that you hung on.<p>I recently learned that a former student of mine committed suicide, and I think about him all the time. I wish I could have told him all this while he was alive.<p>Thanks again for this post.",1323806783

The business would put up its stock as collateral. If the business defaulted on the loan, the bank could seize the stock and the escrow account (but only after pursuing all possible avenues to recover from the debtor business). If the loan was paid back, the stock would be disbursed to the investors. This arrangement wouldn't prevent the possibility of a loss, but by introducing the bank as an intermediary (with the attendant requirements for a loan application), it should help weed out complete scams.",1323806750

3348980,comment,3348671,3348671,5,0,richardburton,,,"I think that manic-depression is extremely common among startup entrepreneurs. The emotional roller-coaster one goes through when trying to create a company exacerbates any bipolar tendencies that might already be there. The great news is that when one is in the state of hypomania they are often at your most creative and productive. Read this description from a well-known, UK-based charity in the UK:<p>""When I'm in a manic phase, I feel as though I am capable of anything and everything. This can be an amazing feeling, but I sometimes get frustrated and angry with people. Ideas flow constantly and quickly, as if my brain is on fast-forward. Everything happening in the world has significance in my life. But when I'm depressed, it's as if I'm completely crushed and living in slow motion. I feel capable of nothing.

3348977,comment,3347720,3347720,1,0,ja27,,,"What about instead using a little base 2 to memorize?
So 'b' can follow 'a' or 'o' and be followed by 'a', 'e', 'i' or 'o'. Take a as 16, e as 8, i as 4, o as 2 and u as 1. So if you memorized '18b30' you could decode that in your mind to the right combinations for 'b'. Obviously this doesn't work for the combinations with two consonants and the words ending in 'y', but it's a start. I think you'd pretty quickly learn common values like 30 is 'aeio'.",1323806613

Just adding data to an Intent (similar to the way you'd add arguments on URL params) can require several extra lines, plus, again the fact that you still haven't accounted for setting up the event handlers, the View object that responds to the click, etc.<p>I'm not knocking Android -- I'm an Android dev. The point I'm trying to make is that building out an ecosystem of interconnected links is hard. The web accomplished this by making the markup for those links very very simple. The total amount of code and setup for one Android application to launch another is far more complex than writing one anchor tag. This is at least a barrier to more widespread adoption of something like Open Intents, etc.",1323806604

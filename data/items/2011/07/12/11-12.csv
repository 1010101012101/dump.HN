I watch mostly ""foreign"" films (i.e. films in a language I don't speak or understand).  If the subtitles aren't included it can be a nightmare to find some (I won't watch dubbed movies).  Sometimes you can't find any subtitles at all (I once had a movie sitting on my HD for over a year waiting for subtitles to show up for it), often when you do find them they're out of sync [1] or awful translations written by people who don't speak one (or both!) languages very well.  Often whole chunks of the movie will be left out or have one word explanations.<p>So for me, the quality is not remotely better via torrents, that's just literally the only option for what I want to watch.<p>[1]  Apparently different formats actually run at different speeds, causing the subtitles to drift if they were made for a different format.

Relational databases are optimized for selects.<p>Easy use cases:<p>Tagging systems where you're tagging million of items.<p>Social graphs, and ""friending"" people are an easy slam dumk for a graph database.<p>I'm convinced that a graph database is the secret to Linked In's success.  Their ability to quickly identify first, second and third order connections are a graph problem, and become a lot easier when you're built on top of a graph database.<p>Commenting systems like HN's commenting system, where a threaded comment ordering is based on frequently changing scores is a giant pain in the ass trying to model in a relational database.  That's why most commenting systems are date based.  That only requires a single SELECT statement in a RDMS.  I know because I built my own, and it was a giant pain, and required modeling a tree structure in a RDMS.  HN's commenting system works well because comments on HN are modeled as an S expression tree, and kept in memory.  Only occasionally are they serialized and written to disk for permanent storage.  I'm convinced that the underlying tree structure is the reason that there hasn't been much innovation in commenting systems for the last decade.<p>Real time recommender systems can be modeled easier in graph structures.<p>Anything semantic web related will probably be modeled in a Graph database easier than in a Relational Database.<p>Also, for further reference, look at Dydra[1] and Directed Edge[2].<p>If you're interested, ping me and I can probably put you in contact with the Neo4j team.

2754361,comment,2753471,2753586,1,0,silencio,,,"One of my criteria for a good registrar measures how much effort it takes to transfer a domain away from the registrar.<p>I love godaddy's customer support even though I am no longer a customer, don't get me wrong. I loved that I could just call them at 4 in the morning with a random problem. What I didn't love was that I had to call them up and live through upsells and boredom in the process of trying to initiate a domain transfer. I unlocked my domain in question, verified the email address, but then I couldn't send an auth code to a known-working admin email and...yeah.<p>I've also moved clients' names away from Network Solutions, since those support people were just beyond unbelievable. One particular support person was telling me that there was a chance I was going to lose the domain if I initiated a transfer and that there would be nothing they could do about it if that happened. I almost lost my cool at that point.<p>No company is perfect and sometimes they have really aggressive retention policies for their support people to follow. I get that. So I'm willing to pay extra for registrars that make it braindead easy for me to do what it takes to get <i>away</i> from them should the need arise.

(developers are the clients in this case)<p>Starting from the ground up with no clients and trying to build a client base on this model would be difficult.  If you can't show results, I'm not going to give you 10% (or any other percentage), mostly because so far I've been DIYing it and doing decent.  But if I already had a ""relationship"" with a recruiter, maybe one who's actually good at technical placement and they found something good for me along with offering to be a long term career guide / mentor / agent, I'd be interested in listening to them much more than if someone just calls me out of the blue.  And if the pay was more than I get now, even with the 10% cut taken out, and involved interesting projects, that would get my attention.<p>I think the long term career guide and mentoring part would have to be a big part of it.  I know my skills but I don't necessarily know who out there wants them, maybe there's people out there who need my skills but also don't know it.  The agent comes into play here and matches up two people who don't know they really need each other in order to make great things.  This takes a lot of work on the part of the agent.<p>If you have this business model, managing 10 to 20 developers and taking 10% cut of salary, that's enough to make a nice living on and you'd have time to be personal with all of them.",1310470822

2754346,comment,2752483,2752483,10,0,asymptotic,,,"There are several important threads that Joe Armstrong brings up that people are completely missing.<p>1) Typing in code directly into a shell necessarily implies you ignore all the tools and IDEs that many beginners clamour for.  In fact, in my experience, coding into Notepad is a far superior learning experience than using an IDE.  Nothing stands between you and your gaping ignorance, and you're forced to grapple with all the hideous details without pretty colours or intelligent auto-completion.<p>2) Typing in code offers you the chance to _deliberately type it in incorrectly and see what happens_.  This is my favourite method of learning.  Take a known good example, and say ""Hmm, if I just do...that...to that line, what happens?"".  And then stare at the error output, immerse yourself in it.  Just as with people, there is no better way of learning about a language, a tool, or an idea than when it is put under stress or unusual circumstances.<p>3) Tools necessarily abstract away some process, whereas when you're learning a new concept or idea the last thing you want is to shy away from the details of a process.  This point reminds me of learning about long division in Year 7 at secondary school, and being forced to draw all these long arrows making clear which digits were going where.  My maths teacher explained the rationale as ""You have to go through all the motions, regardless of how silly or tedious they may seem now.  Eventually you'll just naturally drop them to one side and not need them any more.""",1310470769

I'm not sure <i>developers</i> would go for it, since many tend to have a 'DIY' attitude about everything.<p>What I see in the agent model is that someone follows you and your career for the long haul, and finds you work that helps advance your careers (gets you better parts in projects, better gigs for the band, etc).  I've never met a recruiter that has kept in touch with me for more than a month or so after a successful placement.  They're only working for the employer, because that's who pays them.<p>Would developers be willing to fork over 10% of their pay to an agent who negotiated better pay and benefits for them, helped get better gigs, etc?

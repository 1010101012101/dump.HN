539758,comment,539638,539738,0,0,TimothyFitz,,,"Two options to deal with the ""scary"" part of big integrations in continuous deployment:<p>Don't. Commit early, often and in small chunks. Just search for Continuous Integration, more than enough has been said on it already.<p>When you must, roll out features independently of the code being live in production. This means things like using control logic to roll out the code to portions of users, intelligently. We roll out via: on/off switches (mitigate total failure), A/B tests (mitigate poor performance in front of customers), QA-rollout (mitigate bad experiences for customers), etc. Lots of flexibility here, including hidden rollouts: running the code without showing the results to users, so you can figure out scalability impacts.",1238482047
539757,comment,539694,539694,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"Firstly, as always, congrats for making this happen so far. Two things pop out for me:<p>1) The brand, url etc is all about Phones and nothing about Books. Do you plan to expand the service into other areas? Because right now it sounds like it will cut your phone bill in half, not your next Malcolm Gladwell purchase.<p>2) As phones evolve, will your target market be dwindling. Can I go online with my current phone and look up Amazon while I'm in the bookstore? If I can, why would I call you? If I can't, surely it won't be long before I can - and then, why would I call you?<p>But hey, you've got a revenue model, so who am I to question the niche you seem to be servicing.",1238481839
539755,comment,539694,539694,0,0,tesseract,,,"I like the idea. I am probably a member of your exact target market: I often wander into a bookstore or library to kill time, but don't always have a notepad with me to jot down titles that look interesting. If I had an iPhone I'd use Amazon's app, but I don't.<p>I could barely understand the synthesized voice (there was a lot of hissing and other artifacts when I called; I'm nearly certain they weren't on my end of the connection).<p>I tried a few ISBN's of books I recently purchased on Amazon and fonefu found all 3 titles, but it only gave a price on the one that was available directly from Amazon. I don't know if this is intentional on your part, or a limitation of whatever Amazon API you are using, or what. At any rate perhaps you could make the limitation more clear?<p>When I went back to the website, I typed my phone number in the 555-555-5555 format like the example. However my login attempt was rejected a few times before I thought to try 5555555555 instead.<p>As a non-Friendfeed user I am left wondering why Amazon wishlists aren't also supported as an export target. Maybe another API limitation (not your fault)?<p>I'm going to add the 877 number to my phonebook - if the voice becomes easier to understand I may become a regular user.",1238481764

The robot voice is a bit hard to understand, but I doubt there's much you can do about it.<p>I signed on at the website and tried to enter the phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX and it failed to log me in. When I removed the dashes it worked fine. Weird?<p>Also, on Firefox 3/Ubuntu, the 'add to cart' link goes onto the second line (overlapping 'delete') and didn't seem to do anything when I clicked it.<p>When I deleted an item, it was gone and there's no obvious way to get it back.<p>You might want to allow people to add items to their cart from the web interface somehow (paste link to Amazon page?)<p>The website's favicon is very weird.<p>Cool idea!",1238481504

Although, if I had to speculate, I think Google is doing this because it needs to diversify its business outside of generating cash through advertising.  By investing in ventures, Google should be able to supplement its income nicely, keep its stock price high, and not have in increase operating expenses too much should anything that they invest in takes off.",1238481077

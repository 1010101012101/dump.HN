My proposed solution (that would probably work): teach basic cs in middle schools so it becomes as normal as chemistry, biology, physics, math, social studies, and english- that way, kids wouldn't denote the subject as a particularly male or female oriented path and would simply see it as a stepping stone to another possible career.

5350207,comment,5349626,5349853,25,0,davidmr,,,"As you read this, keep my background in mind: I'm a large-scale linux HPC admin/architect/etc., whose previous experience is in gov't supercomputing labs and whose current company is running many, many thousands of ubuntu LTS servers. I can't speak much about Debian since I haven't used it, so keep in mind that I'm really talking about Ubuntu, not debian-derived distros in general. I've been pretty much stuck to RedHat-derived distributions since the mid to late 90s.<p>The short answer: the choice to use Ubuntu in particular was an incredibly bad decision, and we're ripping it out, but it's going to take forever.<p>A lot of the anti-ubuntu bias you hear (and my own strong anti-ubuntu feelings) are developed from trying to make these things work at scale and in an automated fashion. I'll be the first to admit that you can find lots of smart people (particularly here) who have made this work, but at quite a bit of effort. Woe be unto you if you try to do anything they didn't foresee.<p>* Their packaging guidelines and standards are quite poor--some packages start the daemons on installation (bad), and some don't, but you'll never know which do and which don't until you install them or inspect the debs, and the universe/multiverse repos are even worse. Additionally, some packages require interactive use on installation (NIS, I'm looking in your direction). Yes, you can preseed these questions away, but I find it astoundingly irritating.<p>* Their work on user experience is to the detriment of everything else you'll need to get a stable, predictable system, and they admit this. They half-finish major system changes, and don't give a shit if it works or is documented. Here's a rich one: <a href=""http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/mountall.8.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/en/man8/mountall...</a>. That's one of the most critical pieces of software on the system, and that man page has been unchanged for over 2 years. It does different things depending on what signals it traps, and the only way to find that out was to look through the source. I'd say I generally find something stupid like that every month or so.<p>* Canonical support is a complete and utter joke. The support contract we signed would have been more useful as toilet paper. My company also has quite a few kernel hackers on staff, and we damn well needed them while we waited for canonical to get off their asses and patch serious issues we had (that were, by the way, fixed in the upstream kernel). On two such occasions, I sent in bug reports pointing to lkml posts that pointed out the issues, I backported the patch directly to the Ubuntu release kernel, and still waited months for any movement on the issues.<p>* This is not Canonical/Ubuntu/Debian's fault, but it's still an issue. Any third party software that is sufficiently complicated is rarely tested on debian-based distros before it is released. In some cases, this is fine; in other cases, it's a disaster. There are subtle differences in kernel versions, libraries, etc. that will make some software just plain not work. Other software (Infiniband in particular) is a huge hassle to get working just because nobody who packaged it ever cared to make it work on ubuntu. This is less of an issue in the startup/web app world since a lot of that software really is developed and tested on multiple operating systems. My background is in HPC and research/academic computing, and quite a bit of that software is only used on Scientific Linux or some other RHEL derivative. This is changing a bit with the OpenNebula stuff, but not fast enough for my taste.",1362876943

If you require a full spec to define a very specific format, type annotations, and special designators to actually take advantage of it in any meaningful way, it's not an ""implementation detail"", because as the user, I have to care about it.<p>First of all, it doesn't require a spec. We could have just done some heuristical optimizations like all JS engines have been doing since 2008, finding more cases where we can optimize and so forth - in fact, this was my initial idea for how to do this, as I mentioned earlier.<p>But we did decide to write a spec because (1) we want to be 100% open about this, and a spec makes it easier for others to learn about it, and (2) it helps us check we didn't miss anything because we have a formal type system.<p>>> So asm.js does not expose any implementation details, no more than say CrankShaft and TraceMonkey do in the documents written about ""how to write fast JS for modern JS engines"" (which often say explicit things about ""don't mix types"" and so forth).<p>> That's exposing implementation details, too, and demonstrates a failing of JS.<p>If so, then that exposes a failing of all JITs, including the JVM. All optimizing implementations expose details. People have optimized for the JVM for years.<p>If you can't stand anything between you and the underlying CPU, then nothing portable (like JavaScript, C#, Java, etc.) will satisfy you. Actually even a CPU might not, because CPUs also optimize in unpredictable ways, these same issues are dealt with on that level too.<p>Again, there is room for native apps. But there is also room for portable, standards-based apps. The web is the latter.<p>> Apple and NeXT navigated these waters successfully for multiple decades via Mach-O and CFM fat binaries, and toolchains built around easily and efficiently supporting multiple architectures<p>I do see your point, but that isn't quite the same. Apple fat binaries were of a platform Apple controlled. We are talking about the web, which no one controls. But again, yes, to some degree it is possible as you say to overcome such issues.<p>> The web is competing with native applications. Now you're trying to compete with native operating systems, yet you're not willing to take the steps necessary to actually compete.<p>I disagree. If we have 2x slower than native now, and 1.5x slower than native later on, we're competitive with native on that front. And we have some advantages over native, like portability, which can have long-term performance advantages (for example, we can easily switch to a different underlying CPU if a faster arch shows up). There are also short-term performance advantages to things like Firefox OS that only run web apps, like their graphics stack being much simpler than Android's or Linux's (you don't need another layer underneath the browser compositor, and can go right into GL).",1362876086

I have come to appreciate this a lot in my years working as a sysadmin.<p>Also a note on people's praising the ""smooth"" upgrades between Debian major releases and the less than smooth upgrades between RHEL/Centos major releases:<p>1 - please do keep in mind that RHEL releases are very long lived in the meanwhile technology changes a lot; transitioning from kernel 2.4 to 2.6 has been very tricky for example, or from SysVinit to Upstart (and to Systemd in RHEL 7). It's dificult to foolproof such migrations so the task is left to the sysadmins - plus you always have a LOT of time to plan and do this. And ...<p>2 - Also, while the upgrade process itself has been successful and I get a booting OS with Debian, after a dist-upgrade, there are APIs, ABIs, major versions of software etc that have changed in the new OS and potentially breaking a lot of stuff in very ugly ways.<p>Having said that both platforms have their place and their strengths and I think they complement each other very well to the point that through them we now have a server market massively dominated by Linux.

Although I see how it is great for a high availability strategy as a side-effect, I wonder why you did not want to make use of location information on the phone. 
I mean having the user send his coordinates with his first request would be the obvious choice, but privacy considerations could speak against it.
But if your returned list of available servers for a region would include coordinates, the app would not have to establish connections to all the servers, but maybe just the closest X. That could improve the whole process and save a tiny bit of traffic if you had a lot of servers in every region.
And what about having a list of all your available servers cached with their coordinates in an encrypted sqlite database then? Firewalls that filter the single domain that is queried for server information would not be as successful. On the other hand, old or compromised servers would have to get revoked regularily.
Or Have you had more problems with the idea of phone locations and local server lists?",1362874901

On one machine I was surprised that my assembler code ran, whatever it was, 5-8 times faster than Fortran.  Why?  Because I made better use of the registers.  Of course, that Fortran compiler was not very 'smart', and smarter compilers are quite good at 'optimizing' register usage.  I will write some assembler again if I need it, e.g., for<p>R(n+1) = (A*R(n) + B) mod C<p>where A = 5^15, B = 1, and C = 2^47.  Why that calculation?  For random number generation.  Why in assembler?  Because basically want to take two 64 
bit integers, accumulate in two registers the 128 
bit product, then divide the contents of the two
registers by a 64 bit integer and keep the 64 
bit remainder.  Due to the explicit usage of
registers, usually need to do this in assembler.<p>But at one point I read a comment:  For significantly
long pieces of code, the code from a good compiler tends
to be faster than the code from hand coded assembler.
The explanation went:  For longer pieces of code, good compilers do good things for
reducing execution time that are mostly too difficult
to program by hand which means that the assembler code
tends to be using some inefficient techniques.",1362874142

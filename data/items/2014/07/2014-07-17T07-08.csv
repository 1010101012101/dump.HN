The former is fine and a proud part of France&#x27;s cultural heritage while the later is, unfortunately, illegal: it&#x27;s considered to be active steps to hurt a business or person.<p>So while, technically, she did get sued because her article was highly ranked on Google, what really happened was that the article&#x27;s high google rank allowed her illegal article to be spotted.<p>Whether or not it should have been illegal in the first place is entirely debatable, but given current french laws, the fact that she was sued and lost is perfectly logical.<p>And before the whole &quot;but but... freedom of expression!&quot; crowd comes in: that is not a thing in France. There are some subjects that are illegal to talk about - you could, for example, go to jail for denying the existence of concentration camps (Gayssot law of 2005, I believe).",1405583995

But all of this without the drama and the suffering everybody is mentioning here.<p>So I can&#x27;t understand when some say &quot;that&#x27;s life&quot;, because that&#x27;s not life and saying so stops everybody from looking for an alternative.<p>When I was a kid and later a teenager everybody used to tell me &quot;enjoy your time in school (and later in college), cause once you are out of college your happiest days are behind&quot;.

Shareholder value / the net worth of a company is traditionally defined as the value of future cash distributions.<p>It&#x27;s not a matter of taxing once or twice, it&#x27;s simply a matter of how much taxes have to be paid before the owner(s) get the proceeds. A company&#x27;s tax rate is effectively the percentage of the company owned by the government. Since corporate structure dramatically impacts the tax rate, founders are forced into playing the game, paying for more complex structures that legally reduce the tax rate, in order to retain a greater share of what we build.<p>Keep in mind, of the 6 million companies which have employees in the US, 5.9m of them have less than 100 employees, with total sales/receipts of $7.7 trillion, in 2008. That&#x27;s just shy of a quarter of total U.S sales/receipts. [1]<p>It&#x27;s a bit better now that dividends are taxed the same as capital gains, but unfortunately what should be the simplest / easiest / gold standard way of doing it -- the C Corp -- is still highly tax disadvantaged to other more complex forms, for the vast majority of businesses.<p>The tax code as it stands is a massive drag on productivity and growth.

There are likely hardware-only approaches but they may be prohibitively expensive for a feature no customer wants to pay for.<p>That&#x27;s the big difference between designing a light for the owner&#x27;s protection (who probably won&#x27;t disable the light and will notice if it breaks) versus a light for the protection of others (who might not know to look for a light in the first place, especially once Glass evolves to look like regular glasses).<p>There&#x27;s a laptop accessory market for physically blocking camera switches with state determined at glance. Wearable cameras may need to adopt a similar mechanical approach for today&#x27;s social expectations, but putting switches on your face is somewhat at odds with designing away from the Glasshole Borg look.",1405581672

8046367,comment,8046122,8046204,3,0,boyaka,,,"The reason Moore&#x27;s law worked so well is largely because of this. When we began creating transistors on integrated circuits, the only thing preventing us from making them exactly as small as they are today were things like cost and the capabilities of fabs to make them reliable and stable. So ever since we started making them we&#x27;ve stepped down the size by about half, rather than something smaller that would be more difficult and expensive to make. The entire manufacturing industry gradually became more efficient, increasing reliability and reducing the cost of fabricating the integrated circuits.<p>The history of performance speedup hasn&#x27;t been solely due to doubling the transistors. Other types of architectural improvements in memory, buses, parallelism, multiple cores/threads have yielded performance doubling or more. Memory access has always been a huge latency and there are lots of ways to improve that without just making the transistors smaller.<p>We have a lot of work to do still! The majority of our computing has been on the x86 architecture, which basically stems from the 8080 which was designed in the mid 70s. We can still discover new and better architectures and materials. It&#x27;s just the standard shrinkage of IC&#x27;s that was the basis of Moore&#x27;s Law originally has reached its limits.",1405580450

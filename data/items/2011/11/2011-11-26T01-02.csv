3278853,story,3277219,,1,0,Codayus,,,"My experience is that Python is everywhere, but Ruby is a tiny niche.  I know lots of Python developers, but I don't know a SINGLE Ruby developer.  There was recently a Python conference in my (fairly small) city, but I don't think there's ever been a Ruby conference.  I attend a monthly meetup of Python devs in my (fairly small) city, but there's no Ruby meetup.  I could go on...<p>In fact, I've seriously wondered before why Ruby gets as much notice and buzz as it does.  Lots of talk, but it seems like nobody is actually using it (especially commercially) outside a couple of very high profile projects.  :)<p>Of course, my experience is by no means typical (any more than yours is).  However, do keep in mind that Python is VERY widely used throughout the animation, 3D, VFX, and CGI industries.  Most packages have Python APIs or use Python as their scripting language; as far as I know none use Ruby.  You also see a lot of Python in the game industry (and little or no Ruby).<p>(Also, you're making the common mistake of conflating Python and Django.  Coming from a Rails background this isn't surprising, but Django isn't even the only Python web framework.  Searching for ""ruby + rails"" captures most potential Ruby results, and essentially all potential Ruby web development results.  Search for ""python + django"" results in a much smaller fraction of the total Python or even Python web development results.  It's not an apples to apples comparison.)",1322272789

I had five interviews two Fridays ago, and I offered the second candidate the job - starting on Monday, 20% higher pay than she asked for in her resume, and interesting roles. But I had to know right away, because I had to know what to do with the next set of candidates.<p>Also worth noting is that she didn't have a job currently - her previous company pulled out of China, so there was no risk to her of joining. I was more careful when I recruited a woman who was working at the U.S. Embassy, which was a fantastic stable position with solid pay - I asked her to start here part time for a week or two to make sure there was a fit before quitting a very good job.<p>Anyways, point is, people want decisions fast for many reasons. Look to see if it's in your best interest to decide fast, and decide fast if so. If it's not, push back. Not all fast paces are petty bargaining moves though.",1322272228

This is a very different matter from the gargantuan frameworks (Cocoa, AppKit, UIKit) which Apple has built atop Objective-C.

They have very little incentive to do so: the gulf between what an academic produces and something that is widely useful is usually huge, and academics are not evaluated on patents. Most universities would probably prefer that professors and graduate students patent their work, since it's the university that's more likely to benefit. But professor and grad students rarely bother because, again, they have no incentive.<p>I brought up professor work habits because I felt your impression of their work burden is wrong. I also got the impression that your mistaken impression was feeding your contempt.<p>Let me put it this way: I am unaware of any academic who meets your description. All that I know and know of disseminate their work freely.",1248843594

Here in Australia, Google search seems to account for more then 10X Microsoft + Yahoo.<p>Yahoo (the number 2 at around 5%-10%) doesn't justify logging in to optimise. It also doesn't justify getting good at working with the platform to get the most out of it with less effort. The platforms are also just not as good as adwords. On top of that, the conversion rates seem to always be lower. I'm not sure if this is a reflection on Microhoo users or the ability of the system to optimise the ads themselves. It might even be that having less 'stock' (ads) to run, they are left with poorer choices and run my ads in less then optimal scenarios where google would see the low ctr and run some other ad.<p>It all ads up to Yahoo & Bing being ignored.<p>*Ideally, I would like to run everything from a central console that links to Google, yahoo & whatever else.",1248843478

If Apple wants to approve apps and 'manage' the market, centrally plan away. If Google wants to direct an open system, go ahead. The approaches can compete, that way whatever works lasts and we might have several open or several closed platforms. If they both make it, it probably means they serve different markets.

Honestly, we believe it is better or equal to the best collob apps available out there both in cloud and desktop. It will also allow you to sync your files across computers: work or home.<p>Tonido webshare allows you to share files easily from your computer. You don't need to pay any subscription costs for a cloud storage. Yes there are other free apps available. But not in a one single package as Tonido.<p>If you have lot of high resolution photos, Tonido photos is a perfect fit. It uses p2p overlay to transfer photos. you don't need to wait for lengthy uploads.<p>Tonido jukebox allows you to listen to your music collection from any device with a browser. So you can have a single music server that streams music to multiple devices.<p>Tonido Torrent is a web based bit torrent client - If you want to start and stop torrents remotely - good option.<p>Tonido thots is a simple journal to capture your thoughts - like your personal wordpress.<p>TonidoPlug runs on 1/10 of your desktop or laptop power. That saves electricity costs.<p>There are number of other apps are also in pipeline: screenshare, openid, backup-sync,  backpack clone.<p>In short, it really offers benefits other than not being cloud. It is quite possible one might not need any of these apps or the features that Tonido provides.It is not perfect. There are rough edges.

You can seamlessly combine projectors to create a display as big as you want.

729431,comment,728975,728975,0,0,olliesaunders,,,"For me test-first-developed-code is a big factor in what I consider to be good code, which is I think what you mean when you say ""elegant code"". Elegance is a funny sort of word that people struggle to define, and, not necessarily, a huge player in what good code is (for which there are some relatively precise definitions).<p>Ideally, I like to write everything with good tests first. However, this requires a small amount of up-front design, usually done in your head (the stuff you do in order to know what your first test is). Most of the time that small amount of up-front design is small enough to cope with but when you're working with someone else's API that you don't know, or you're doing something very experimental, small isn't small enough. Here \nare some possible ways you might solve that problem:<p>1. Prototype.<p>Write something to try out a design. ""Hammer out"", by all means. At this stage you want to ascertain whether your design is a good idea or not and you don't want to waste any time on code quality in case it's a bad one. Ruthlessly dispense with all unnecessary complexities, prove the concepts and nothing more.<p>If this doesn't work or you think you can do better with a different design you can throw this away. Suggestion: Commit it in your version control and then delete the file; it's around in version control if you need it again.<p>Sometimes your prototype will work in which case you should absolutely put in retrograde tests (the tests that you would have written if you were writing it test-first). Then, as others have suggested, refactor and refine.<p>2. Model<p>I still occasionally get out the ol' pen and paper and scribble some a loose UML class diagram showing the concepts I've identified and how they might link together. In my experience it's not worth spending much more than 30 minutes doing this and I never expect the design to work without alteration. Sometimes it deviates substantially when I start coding but it helped me get started so that's fine.<p>Other times you may find writing use cases or user stories more appropriate and there are number ways to do them.<p>This short blog post discusses the differences between types of modelling that I found very enlightening when I read: <a href=""http://www.benjaminbooth.com/tableorbooth/2008/05/summary-dialogue-concerning-the-two-chief-modeling-systems.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.benjaminbooth.com/tableorbooth/2008/05/summary-di...</a><p>In the end it's whatever works for you to get a better idea of the problem. Mind mapping even! (Disclaimer: Never tried one that for code)<p>3. Pseudo-code<p>I rejected pseudo-code as one of those out of date techniques that has no place in the post-mainframe generation. But actually in select situations it's a nice compromise between a user story and a prototype. Typically the time you'll want to write pseudo-code is when you're working with something requiring a large number of procedural-like operations to be done to it in order to get a result. Stuff like data mungeing or gluing together a large number of systems or languages to achieve something.<p>I had a situation where I had to parse a file full of inconsistencies.  Psuedo-code was excellent for that because it helped me identify the strategies I needed to deal with those inconsistencies. It ended up being a big-design-up-fronty sort of project but that was necessary because whenever I just dived into code I'd end up writing things that would work for one bit and then fall over on others; although a couple of those prototype components ended up being useful later on.<p>Possible Anti-pattern: The snowball prototype<p>If you are prototyping look out for the tendency to add to your prototype with increasingly more ambitious functionality. Once you prove one thing works it's very tempting to add the next idea you have to see if that works and so on. At some point you're going to have to stop and refactor otherwise you'll be programming spaghetti by the next day.<p>Alternatively create separate prototypes for each idea, refactoring out common components from the others where you need them. This should provide some reasonable designs (even without tests) whilst simultaneously maintaining a great deal of that speed that's so desirable in this experimental phase of development.<p>Hope this helps.",1248840580

It's mediocre at best and a waste of time at worst; it really does nothing to help the whole learning process aside from acting like a clumsy file locker that is best provided by something else like, maybe, a directory listing.<p>That said, given that Blackboard has also had control of WebCT for some time now, they run pretty much a straight-up monopoly in this market, and it's actually nice to see them get yanked of at least one of their toys even if they were allowed to cause severe damage to another company in the process.  It's a shame, but this company really needs to get with the program and understand that this abuse of intellectual property law won't be tolerated.<p>Nevertheless, yes, why was this patent awarded in the first place?  I'm curious since my tax payment somehow went into making this whole mess happen, and that fact alone is making me somewhat angry.",1248840109

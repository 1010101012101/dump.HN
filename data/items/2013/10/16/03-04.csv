If I could get a $100K salary on my own, I would expect you to find me similar positions for $120K to justify taking a 10% finders fee from me and not from the company.<p>Also this would need to have contingencies built in for a poor fit.

We were pretty good at our jobs, but the company was experiencing some really nasty growing pains, and the product was pretty bad as a result.<p>One of the big pains in the webhosting world is maintaining legacy systems...we had about 15,000 clients on ancient servers running RHEL4, under a proprietary VPS platform. (And as far as I know, a big chunk of them are still there.) Needless to say, this resulted in a really crappy service for the clients on those servers, and there never seemed to be a big push to get everybody migrated off of them and onto our newer servers running cPanel. We were working towards it, but it was a big endeavor that would leave a lot of clients extremely upset when things invariably went awry. So rather then putting some good development time towards automating the process as much as possible and hiring more support for those accounts that didn&#x27;t migrate properly, the problem just sat there for years.",1381895791

I suppose one way to deal with the externalities of everybody always going up for promo is to make the process easier on people who don&#x27;t.<p>BTW, there are regular performance reviews at Google - you can (and should) get your peers&#x27; feedback without actually going up for promotion.

That claim is simply false.  There are boatloads of experienced Java developers.  The people who tend to write &quot;strongly typed languages compiling to JS&quot; tend to write those languages, and not JS.<p>To be clear: the web would not be what it is without JS, and Node is a fascinating and innovative thing.  I disagree that there are loads of people who are experienced in C/C++ are champing at the bit to go write Node.  The Java/C# talent pool is massively larger than the non-frontend JS talent pool at this time, and the C/C++ talent pool is largely otherwise occupied.

I&#x27;ll be keeping a close eye on this.<p>I think the tagline &quot;Grow your church community and increase giving&quot; doesn&#x27;t feel quite right. Specifically, &quot;increase giving&quot; sounds a little bit ... greedy, maybe?

The pain-point isn&#x27;t that churches want more money, it&#x27;s that they want to be able do more, help more, serve more.",1381894567

Unambiguously.  Otherwise it&#x27;s difficult to tell who sent what, since you might be sending any number of pieces of coins that all make up &quot;your&quot; transaction, which is complex / nigh-impossible to solve without other ways of verifying (such as including a message in the transaction).  This is made even more complex if you receive many transactions from many people with a single address.<p>Second is anonymity.  If you reuse &quot;your&quot; wallet and it&#x27;s ever connected to you, so is <i>every</i> transaction out of it, forever.  If you value the anonymity side of Bitcoin, it&#x27;s <i>very important</i>, but not <i>sufficient</i>.  If you don&#x27;t care about anonymity, the only other downside is that someone who gets your private key can wait until your wallet is bigger before stealing the bitcoins.  If you constantly change addresses, the old private key is essentially worthless as soon as you make any transaction.  Honestly that&#x27;s pretty unlikely, and if they have your private key it&#x27;s game over anyway, they can steal it all at any time they want.",1381894012

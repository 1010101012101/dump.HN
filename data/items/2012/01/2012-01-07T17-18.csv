But then again aren't you  confusing the concepts of ""free market economy"" and capitalism with the former just being one possible form of the latter. Another possible form being a ""social market"" which should allow for some kind of state intervention on a lot of the issues being raised here.<p>PS A genuine thank you for engaging in discussion as opposed to hit and run downvoting",1325959137

It takes a little while to get settled (back) into a job. If the employee on maternity leave has been taking correspondence courses, good for her, but her replacement has spent that time working at the actual job. If the replacement has been doing good work, I would rather keep him/her rather than hire back the original worker, who might be ""out of the groove"" after a long maternity leave.",1325959132

Some of those people are 50+. Some of them are 25. Some 20-somethings code for 2 years, write an O'Reilly book, and then reposition themselves as ""architects"". So many young people did this with the title ""CTO"" that the term ""CTO"" got tainted.<p>This is something I was taught in 3rd grade, but apparently hasn't percolated into the public school system, so we're having to teach it to adults at great expense: <i>one needs to be vigilant about prejudice</i>.<p>Or, in some cases not, because one of the subtexts behind ageism is that talent is getting more and more expensive, and firms want to avoid engaging with that reality. At least 21 year olds come bundled with the pretense of inexperience, so you can pay them 40% of scale.<p>If I sound self-righteous about this, I apologize; I'm really not upset by it, because it is one of the more easily exploitable market inefficiencies our industry cultivates.

3437517,comment,3433377,3433377,3,0,tripzilch,,,"I think this is mainly a USA thing. I've practiced Yoga for years in the Netherlands, and if anything, it is about <i>not</i> straining yourself, or if you do stretch something, to only stretch it when you can be completely feeling and aware of the thing you're stretching. You need that awareness <i>first and foremost</i>, and then the posture.<p>It's incredibly hard, nearly impossible, to feel and be aware in a body part when it's in pain from overstretching or tension. Consciousness doesn't like to go there, as long as the nerves are occupied with sending pain signals, they're not doing much feeling. If you ignore or block the pain you're not being aware, but if you do, the pain is ""louder"" than anything else, so you're still not getting much.<p>It's stupid and useless. The goal should be the awareness, so you're <i>much</i> better off doing simple postures, or simplified versions of complex postures, or just see how far you can go while still being comfortable and <i>aware</i>.<p>If you practice it this way, you'll know when you're going too far, because your awareness will fade (you'll often just realize it in hindsight, though, in the moment, you're not aware that you're not aware, just like Dunning-Kruger) and if you don't, that's what the teacher is for. S/he will pay attention to the students and notice when they're more involved with doing a posture than with paying attention to what all there is to feel inside their bodies.<p>I just can't get my head around this, to get all the benefits of Yoga, you can just stick to the simplest postures <i>and do them a lot</i> (unless you're injured in which case you do them even simpler, the Sawasana is just lying down flat on your back, so there's always that one). If you try postures that are too complicated or straining for your body-flexibility, you'll get nothing! Except injury! It's just stupid, these supposed ""experienced"" Yoga practitioners, ""advancing"" to more and more complicated postures, I suppose every time they feel ""comfortable"" in some posture they move on to something new! They're missing the whole point! Feeling comfortable? <i>Good.</i> Everything you did before was not Yoga, but warming-up and stretch exercises. It's Yoga when you can relax in a posture, without strain, without pain. And if there's some posture for which that seems impossible to you, do a different one. It's okay, they're not ""better"" than the ones you're comfortable in.",1325958242

Startups are not the best option for 50 year olds.<p>Most 50 year olds demand high salaries, aren't willing to work long hours (let alone nights and weekends), are far less familiar with new technologies and less willing to learn, and are much more cynical than 20 somethings. The risk, uncertainty, and low structure environment of a startup is just a bad fit for the age group in general.<p>Our society hasn't yet adapted to the fact that as people get older in technology, they get less competent but demand higher and higher salaries due to their increasing fixed costs (mortgage, etc.).<p>Those who will argue with you about the above facts want to eat their cake and keep it too, like the women who want to have kids and pregnancy and a social life but also want to make it big at a high tech startup. People do not want to acknowledge that tradeoffs exist: that women with young children can't put in long hours or that old folks just aren't as plastic and supple.<p>Some engineers age like Ken Ritchie, and stay sharp. Some go into management or do consulting on legacy systems. Those are all legit options. A 50 something should have enough savings to bankroll his own startup; that too is a legit option.

Burnout! If you choose to go full-time and a startup you're going to hit a wall. Naturally if you do more than one startup you just hit it faster...<p>So the issue is commitment. My advise would be to divide your week into blocks of commitment for each project. In my case Mon,Wed,Fri,Sun using 4 hour blocks per dsy for startup A. Tues, Thurs of 4 hour blocks on startup B (Saturday is a much needed recovery day, normally resulting in a much deserved hangover).<p>Another consideration is how you work...<p>For example I am an 80/80 person. I work 80% and play 80%, the important part is that i'm never 100% at one time so have that buffer to avoid burnout... you have to find a balance between the minimum required effort to have a successful company and your own personal space (even work-a-holics sleep, generally on the keyboard)<p>As you have experience with startups i'm surprised you've so easily embraced another two projects. However that intimates that you know how to divide you time between them...

This insurances are calculated on base up to 1000 euro - so your insurance taxes are max 30% of 1000 euro even if you get more than this level. Over the rest of the money you have 20% flat state tax. On every purchase you have 20% VAT.",1325956693

The majority owner has slowly purchased units, stripped them of utilities and let them lie fallow without renting them.<p>The subdivision has well-written deed restrictions limiting the land to residential-only use. Commercial entities are specifically disallowed (churches and private schools are commercial entities in Texas). The deed restrictions can be changed only by majority subdivision vote once every 10 years (2020 next vote). The church/school does not own a majority of the land in the subdivision.<p>Through these shell corporations, the church/school has quietly purchased properties at residential rates in this deed-restricted residential-only subdivision and then converted the land to commercial use (IMO a clear violation of the deed restrictions). Commercial land in the same neighborhood is _very_ expensive. The city is allowed to enforce deed restrictions but is reluctant to do so.<p>The condo regime requires that units be kept for the welfare of the owners and residents but soon the majority owner will take over the condominium board. Minority owners fear that the majority owner will use the condominium association's powers to drive them out..<p>To me there appears to be a legal conflict of interest: all condo owners sign an agreement to support the condo regime and the welfare of all owners in perpetuity, yet this particular majority owner seeks to liquidate the condo regime.<p>Anyone have expertise in handling this type of case in Texas? Or who can direct me to someone familiar with this type of takeover?<p>What does this have to do with conspiracy? The ties of the church/school to the city government, the local legal community and real estate developers are deep and intricate. Most real estate attorneys we have spoken to have some affiliation with the church/school (which is a very large and very wealthy organization) and cannot or will not sell their services to us. For years the companies that were acquiring units in the condo used multiple shell corporations to do so. It was not clear what was happening until fairly recently.",1325956685

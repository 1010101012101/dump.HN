As I&#x27;m reading it, your approach doesn&#x27;t make sense to me.    If you want to distinguish between two treatments (placebo=treated and do-nothing=untreated) you need to measure outcomes for both treated and untreated individuals, and these individuals need to be &quot;exchangeable&quot; to some degree.<p>Perhaps when you say in the first post &quot;give people placebo&quot;, you mean &quot;give the placebo to some subset of the individuals leaving the remainder untreated&quot;?  I agree that you can often draw useful conclusions from an observational study as long as some comparable individuals receive each treatment, and as long as you can control for the initial differences between the treated and untreated.  But if you are saying that you don&#x27;t need to look at the results for the untreated group at all, then I think you are mistaken.",1450227545

It seems it has been tweeked a lot since then, but those problems have not been fixed. I don&#x27;t think next version of angular is usable for me.<p>Typescript&#x27;s audience is far less than Angular&#x27;s audience, there should be no reason to use typescript as the official example.

There&#x27;s a lot of people who don&#x27;t work; whether they collect disability/welfare, live off relatives, or make money through the grey/black markets I don&#x27;t think the job market has really recovered nearly as much as a lot of people think. And a lot of those jobs are part-time or low wage. Perhaps that&#x27;s anecdotal from the impression I get, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like their model takes any of that into account.<p>Even without inflation it doesn&#x27;t seem like the people I&#x27;m around (mostly middle to lower class) have all that much extra spending money laying around these days.

With the shift from US to China in manufacturing and hardware, we reflected on why it will be increasingly difficult for US to build their own consumer products and the future of consumer hardware will belong to the Chinese in the next two decades.

I can only guess this is because all agree: it goes without saying that this sweeping generalisation is patently untrue.<p>Still, allow me to humor you and give just one (of the many) reason(s) why: async I/O.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s possible in Java. Yes, Java has futures that make it not just possible, but also a reality in this universe.<p>Unfortunately, Java has made the inconvenient decision to retain backwards compatibility and keep all its synchronous I/O operations available. Perhaps not a complete folly. For all of the good that decision has brought, there is one downside: any code (any lib) can still lock up an entire OS thread. Result: all libs actually do this. No matter how Future-istic your codebase; use <i>any</i> lib and you&#x27;re back to sync I/O.[1] This is absolutely killing for high concurrency, I/O bound servers, who now lock up not just an FD or two per conn, but also an entire OS thread.<p>Javascript&#x27;s threading model, on the other hand, is so shit that it came out the other side. By being inherently single threaded, all blocking I/O must be done through callbacks. Result: <i>you can&#x27;t block an OS level thread in javascript!</i> So all libraries are inherently async (from the OS level).<p>There are, of course, many more reasons why Java is not &quot;much better suitable for the server side than node&quot;, but this is just one of them (libraries, existing knowledge in your org, community, ...). In reality, both have their uses. Node has proven itself by now.<p>Disclaimer: I actually hate Javascript. And Java. Including Java 8 (for all the shit it, wisely, keeps around).<p>[1] E.g. Amazon&#x27;s official AWS SDK, which is sync IO. Want async IO for S3 (or anything there)? Write it yourself. Which you won&#x27;t. Because there&#x27;s already a lib. &quot;But it&#x27;s not async!&quot; // TODO.",1450226424

The estimate was originally somewhere around early 2016, so this is a huge deal for them to get this out before the year was up. Unfortunately, Angular 2 launched into beta too late. In the amount of time that Angular 2 has taken to get to beta, ReactJS has slaughtered the front-end market share (in a good way) and completely taken developers by storm with its simplistic component based approach.<p>Unlike React, Google does not really treat Angular as a first-class citizen because they have such split focus and conflicting React like library for web components called Polymer. They provide some resources, but nowhere near the amount of resources that Facebook throws behind React and React Native.<p>Now lets talk about the fact that the Angular 2 project got off to a shaky start and I know they actually rewrote various parts from scratch more than once (hence why it took so long to reach beta, approximately 2 years). That horrible templating syntax needs to be mentioned, the decision to use square and rounded brackets for binding events/data and using things like asterisks in my opinion makes Angular 2 fall into the same trap that Angular 1 did in regards to developer accessibility.<p>I am really loving TypeScript these days and I think the decision to support it as a first-class citizen out-of-the-box was a good one (the partnership with Microsoft definitely paid off). But with that said, I think Rob Eisenberg (of Durandal fame) beat the Angular 2 team to the punch in the small space of a year in releasing his framework Aurelia (<a href=""http://aurelia.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aurelia.io</a>).

Right now though it isn&#x27;t enough.<p>It&#x27;s too slow or too inconvenient for most things you&#x27;d want in a PK. Creating files isn&#x27;t fast or easy. Usually you need to open some other app to do it, even if it&#x27;s just a terminal. Linking one file to another and showing the connection with metadata like the direction of the link is possible, but not easy, especially if you want multiple links to and from a file. You can sync with things like Dropbox, but search is painfully slow and viewing/editing files means opening a different app. It&#x27;s just cumbersome.<p>The reason I like TheBrain is actually because it&#x27;s good for much more than todos and project data. I have one &quot;file&quot; that has over 10 thousand notes in it. It&#x27;s organized arbitrarily by my preference, but definitely structured, searchable and &quot;infinitely&quot; expandable. The best part though is that it&#x27;s really easy to visualize related data in TheBrain. In fact, as I&#x27;ve read comments today, I&#x27;ve come to realize that that is the one crucial thing most PK&#x27;s are missing. There aren&#x27;t good visualizations for Evernote, OneNote, most filesystems, org mode, etc.<p>I&quot;m with you, there&#x27;s no reason the filesystem can&#x27;t become the best PK, but it&#x27;s far from that now.",1450224271

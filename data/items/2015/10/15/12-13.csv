I don&#x27;t believe that darts were thrown at a wall with words written on them and they landed on &quot;Coffee Shops&quot; and &quot;Fried Chicken&quot;.  I think the analysis started with the assumption that Coffee shops would be found in nicer areas and Fried Chicken would be found in rougher areas.  Then the analysis was started to evaluate that hypothesis.  It&#x27;s OK that areas of with different economic conditions may have different types of businesses.

You have to recognize every company is dysfunctional at some level, and that doesn&#x27;t necessarily make it bad.  The grass is really not always greener on the other side, it just feels that way sometimes.<p>A note on compensation, you must negotiate that up front and not expect it to change during the first year at least.  It isn&#x27;t that you won&#x27;t get raises but get what you feel is fair up front so 6 months in you aren&#x27;t feeling neglected.  Also, be cautious about giving up salary for bonuses unless you can truly control the factors for the bonus.  I have seen many companies claim that while they are paying you less in salary you&#x27;ll make more in their bonus program. But then they tie that bonus program to increased sales when you are an engineer.  That isn&#x27;t a fair or valid bonus program unless you can directly impact sales, otherwise it is like saying, if Bob & Sally do their job you can see a bonus. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they hit it 10 times prior, don&#x27;t fall for that crap.  BTW -- this is more typical to see in a SMB that is non-tech focused but it can happen anywhere.",1444913631

I remember 40 years ago it was possible that rather obvious facts (such as &quot;you need to queue a long time to get basic consumer goods in the USRR&quot;) were dismissed simply because they could be labeled &quot;CIA propaganda&quot;.</i><p>This was even scarier before that. Check out the following biography review[0]; it&#x27;s worth the time to read. Some quotes:<p>&quot;although it is clear to him that the Soviet economy is struggling, every dispatch they are given to send home declares that things are better than ever, that the Workers’ Paradise is even more paradisiacal than previously believed, that the evidence is in and Stalinism is the winner. It doesn’t matter what he makes of this, because anything he writes which deviates from the script is rejected by the censors, who ban him from sending it home. He is reduced to sending secret messages at the bottoms of people’s suitcases, only to find to his horror that even when they successfully reach the Guardian offices back in Britain, his bosses have no interest in publishing them because they offend the prejudices of its progressive readership.<p>(...)<p>His final break with the rest of the enlightened progressive world comes when he decides to do something that perhaps no other journalist in the entire Soviet Union had dared – to go off the reservation, so to speak, leave Moscow undercover, and see if he can actually get into the regions where rumors say some kind of famine might be happening. The plan goes without a hitch, he passes himself off as a generic middle-class Soviet, and he ends up in Ukraine right in the middle of Stalin’s Great Famine. He describes the scene – famished skeletons begging for crumbs, secret police herding entire towns into railway cars never to be seen again. At great risk to himself, he smuggles notes about the genocide out of the country, only to be met – once again – with total lack of interest. Guardian readers don’t look at the newspapers to hear bad things about the Soviet Union! Guardian readers want to hear about how the Glorious Future is already on its way! He is quickly sidelined in favor of the true stars of Soviet journalism, people like Walter Duranty, the New York Times‘s Russia correspondent, who wrote story after story about how prosperous and happy and well-fed the Soviets were under Stalin, and who later won the Pulitzer Prize for his troubles.&quot;<p>Guessing from the review, the book paints a scary picture of how West intellectualists basically fooled themselves and self-spun propaganda about the Soviet Union for decades.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/11/book-review-chronicles-of-wasted-time/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/08/11/book-review-chronicles-...</a>",1444912369

The only thing that holds the corporations back, is the fear of lawsuits and the corresponding economical hit they might take.<p>But in any case, you how can you trust software and firmware? The programmer is only one amongst the earliest steps in chain of creation of the software or firmware. While in small shops, it&#x27;s often the programmer who will produce the binaries for distribution, in bigger shops and notably when the software is enclosed in firmware, the original programmer is several steps removed from the actual production of the firmware or distribution media (eg. signing and uploading on AppStore), and at each of those steps, the software could be tampered with, if it wasn&#x27;t defective at the origin. This is not to exonerate programmers (eg. in the case of the Toyota firmware, it was the programmers who produced the awful and fatal firmware), but to mention that a lot of parties, both inside and outside the corporation selling the software can introduce bugs or malware.<p>Therefore you need 4 things:<p>- you need to trust the hardware itself. If you&#x27;ve not built your microchips yourself from sand, can you trust Intel? Can you trust a Chinese chip? Can you trust a Russian chip? A couple of years ago, there was some scare from a paper describing some Chinese spying chip (it might have been a fake, but it&#x27;s perfectly possible).<p>- you need to trust the OS (BIOS, system, tools), and the compiler. (cf. Ken Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Trusting Trust&quot; and &quot;Reflections on Trusting Trust&quot;, and Schneier&#x27;s &quot;Countering &#x27;Trusting Trust&#x27;&quot;). The point here, is that you have to have the sources to all those software components, and you have to compile them yourself, using a trusted compiler (and how do you get a trusted compiler? It&#x27;s not entirely trivial, even if Scheneier gives a solution).<p>- now you need all the sources of the software and firmware of the concerned devices, so that you may audit them (otherwise, you might be using for decades software with obvious bugs, backdoors or other malware, cf. recent examples as the bash shell bug, the openssl bugs, the toyota firmware problems, and indeed, the VW hack, etc),<p>- and you need to compile and integrate/install it intot he device yourself, using the trusted OS and compiler obtained at step 2.<p>Now, of course, it&#x27;s not the final user who can do all that. But as the countries have administrations to test and check the properties of drugs (eg. the FDA in the USA), and allow the drugs to be on the market only after strict checks and validations, countries could forbid the sale of any hardware containing software or firmware, and of any software, that:<p>1- is not provided in source form with all the required instructions and dependencies to compile and install it in the devices they want to sell, and<p>2- has not passed a full, precise and exhaustive &quot;code review&quot; mandated by a FSA (Federal Software Administration), and received thus an authorisation of sale, along with a FSA distribution of that software.<p>Now, for the state it would be ok to use that FSA distribution, but how a final customer (persons or corporations), could trust the FSA of their country. After all, their NSA could have introduced new backdoors, or the FSA could be corrupted by lobbies too! Therefore the alerted user or the concious corporation will want to have the sources and compile and install them themselves too, after an audit (which would be lighter, including eg. only a comparison of those sources with the one from the original company).<p>In conclusion, what you want is a law that forbid the sale of non-free(dom) software or firmware (because, if anybody introduced a backdoor in the sources, you want to be able to remove it for your own usage, or that of your friends or customers).<p>Forbid the sale of any non-free(dom) software or firmware!",1444911474

You literally can never stop learning.<p>The usual excuses are &quot;i&#x27;m too old&quot;, &quot;i don&#x27;t have enough time&quot;, &quot;i&#x27;m not talented&quot;... Well you&#x27;re never too old to learn something new, and as for time at first you only need an hour a day to get into coding, i don&#x27;t recommend throwing yourself into it, at first just start slow. And trust me its true that some people are talented in coding, but the people that make it are the ones that love it and work at it everyday until they master it.<p>Now comes the part &quot;What should i learn?&quot; Well it really depends on you, coding has multiple domains, but i always divide it into 3 big categories Software development, Web development and mobile development. All of them are good domains, and you can start in anyone of them and then specialize. For example if you choose web development you can either continue as a frontend, backend or a fullstack developer...<p>Learn to code. It will change your life for the better.",1444911024

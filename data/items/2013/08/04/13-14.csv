There&#x27;s public outrage which they can use for their own benefit and they could easily frame this as defending the American citizens while covering their own asses, but they&#x27;re not doing that either. In fact, the amendment that was proposed to defund the NSA phone surveillance didn&#x27;t pass, so what&#x27;s going on?<p>Also, blackmail isn&#x27;t that easy. If something embarrassing is revealed about a politician who seemed to be critical of the NSA, you think people wouldn&#x27;t start pointing fingers to the NSA and accusing them of blackmail?",1375624716

Therefore the going rate will be whatever maximizes profits, which doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean providing services to everyone (at least in backwards countries) but usually means providing service to &quot;most of the community&quot;, more or less.<p>That&#x27;s why when very few people are tourists, its profitable for the tourists.  Obviously this doesn&#x27;t scale because if you can outsource basically all non-emergency medical care, prices will rise for tourism because the served group now earns 5x as much so &quot;why not&quot; charge 5x as much if the locals don&#x27;t go there anymore.<p>Its no different than &quot;tourist-y&quot; restaurants and stores.  Once the locals are chased away, prices explode to what the tourists can pay, what the locals pay doesn&#x27;t matter, they&#x27;re kicked out of the market.<p>Once the real economic value disappears, all thats left are scammers.  So &quot;everybody knows&quot; that going to .mx for raw vanilla, tequila, and jewelry is a losing proposition because so many crooks are involved.  You&#x27;ll hear accusations of this for medical tourism, but its just not there yet.

Absolutely should be prosecuted.  Paying for CP (and thereby directly contributing, economically, to its production)?  Definitely.  But just downloading and viewing an image?  I&#x27;m no fan of the idea of CP, nor a radical libertarian, but I just can&#x27;t grok this idea.<p>I&#x27;ve heard many justifications for it.  The most substantial of these seek to establish some connection between demand for this content (by non-paying/free viewers) and the economic motive to create it.  I think many people in this thread--and numerous investigations--have found this link to be tenuous/nonexistent.  What, are child porn producers running a charity or something?  They&#x27;re in it for the money.  If you download pirated/free CP, they don&#x27;t get paid, and they&#x27;ll never get paid.<p>The more ridiculous explanations, frequently deployed by Jesus politicians and law enforcement lobbies, have to do with a link between consumption of CP and real-life sexual abuse/assault/molestation/rape of minors.  Even if we assume, for a moment, that there is some connection and that the causality is intelligible[1], how is that compatible with the spirit of hundreds of years of Anglo-American liberal intellectual history and legal theory?  Since when is it okay (or constitutional, etc.) to prosecute someone for something they <i>might</i> do, but haven&#x27;t actually done?  Is this possible in any other area of law, or is CP that special?  Why&#x27;s it so special?<p>[1] Does CP cause sexual abusers of children to go do that?

6155529,comment,6154493,6155438,7,0,derefr,,,"No: &quot;many of the non-producing &#x27;pirate&#x27; distributors are driven out of the distribution market by law enforcement&quot; is exactly the opposite of the case. Law-enforcement has the <i>smallest</i> impact on the secondary-market distributors.<p><i>Producers</i>, whose content get leaked to the secondary market, get caught by law-enforcement, because each video available to law-enforcement is one more piece of evidence that can be used to track and trap them.<p>The consumers in the primary market will get in trouble <i>with the producers</i> for their leaking to the secondary market--much in the same way that Microsoft will get mad at you for leaking your company&#x27;s Windows/Office MAK key. If a producer has only given copies of a video to five primary-market consumers, it&#x27;s quite easy to figure out which of those consumers is responsible for the leak. The law doesn&#x27;t have a good way to catch these people; but the producers do. (In a lot of cases, this amounts to literally being &quot;in trouble with the mob.&quot;) Note that this knocks a consumer out of the <i>primary</i> market--but <i>increases</i> the amount of free content available in the secondary market. Since producers and consumers are taken out of the primary market in equal numbers when this happens, supply/demand stays constant.<p>The &quot;pirate&quot; re-distributors in the secondary market--the people these primary consumers leak <i>to</i>--don&#x27;t care about any of this. They have no personal relationships with the primary market, and are not personally involved in it, other than in consuming and sharing the content produced there. They also don&#x27;t have to share any personally-identifying details about themselves to participate in the secondary market (they can just be a TORified IP address, unlike the primary market which operates more through established contacts.)<p>However, by and large, the secondary market is overwhelmingly larger than the primary market--and so, when a Best Buy repair tech finds exploitative pornography on someone&#x27;s hard disk, that person will likely be a member of the secondary market. Catching anyone from the primary market requires these social-engineering-based busts that you hear about--where someone infiltrates a primary market--precisely because there&#x27;s no social &quot;path&quot; from the secondary market back into the primary market.",1375621962

6155524,comment,6155030,6155467,6,0,rayiner,,,"I&#x27;m not sure what the solution might be. I think its an excellent feature of the system that a judge, who can see the whole situation in front of him, is empowered to set sentences instead of a legislature that must necessarily speak in general terms. My preferred solution would be to get rid of statutory sentences and sentencing guidelines and instead just have a couple of maximums (20 years for a non-homicide crime, life/death for homicide). But that wouldn&#x27;t stop prosecutors from bullying a defendant into accepting a plea deal by arguing &quot;the judge could sentence you to up to 20 years!&quot;<p>The other solution, less discretion in the hands of the judge is, I think, worse. Americans are not a compassionate people to criminals. It&#x27;s easy for a voter and a legislator to call for 20 years or 30 years for a crime. Much harder for a judge sitting in front of a real human being to do that. So if you move discretion more to the statutory process, I think you&#x27;ll get the opposite of the desired result.",1375621854

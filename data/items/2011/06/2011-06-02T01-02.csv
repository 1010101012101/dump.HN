2610255,comment,2609674,2609674,10,0,pewpewlasergun,,,"I feel like this article is an example of how a lot of charity and social businesses are half-baked at best.<p>First is the idea, mostly held by people at places like Dartmouth, that because these problems exist it must mean that nobody is trying to solve them. In reality, plenty of people are trying to solve them, its just difficult.  This leads people to start their own charities that end up competing with each other for donations and thus it is difficult to develop the economies of scale that makes this stuff efficient.<p>The article mostly talks about the lack of market research.  Its not difficult to ask someone 'What do you need' or 'Why don't you have running water' or 'Do you need your house to double as a workshop' and this would have helped guide the designs.  A simple walk through and critical thinking would have shown designers that many people lived in apartments, and perhaps a 3000 dollar apartment building would get more use.<p>The article brings up putting local laborers out of business.  I'm not sure I buy this argument against charity.  The authors had spent previous paragraphs explaining the need for customization.  The builders would not automatically be out of work if people bought prefab houses.<p>I guess in conclusion I think a lot of people who go into charity have the 'saving the world' attitude that makes them arrogant.  This leads to people trying the same thing over and over again, and while competition is great in a market economy, when non-profits are competing for donations it leads to the non-profits viewing the donators as their customers and the most important people to please rather than the people they claim to help.",1306979131

But most commonly used fingerprint scanners are incredibly easy to fool (even including so called ""high-security"" sensors that happily accept photocopy of fingerprint as valid finger). Bypassing the sensor is often even easier, but on the other hand I've seen systems (for example BIOS level fingerprint authentication on ThinkPads) that are explicitly designed as to make that very expensive (in the ThinkPad case you would have to actually decapsulate the sensor chip from it's package).",1306977557

So there's no reason to believe that the only hardware that can run it is HP's,"" Leo said.  ""By the way, they don't have to be 'hardware makers' in the classical IT sense.  There are many people who make all kinds of control devices, why wouldn't they want to use webOS for that?  Appliance makers can use webOS to create connectivity between their appliances and the Web.""<p>""There are all kinds of other people who want to make whatever device or piece of hardware they make connected to the Internet,"" he continued.  ""And therefore, we'd like to make webOS available to these people, as we are going to make webOS available to enterprises, or indeed to SMB's who want to create whatever kind of environment within their own firewall.""<p>""So from that perspective, yes, webOS will be more than just running inside or on top of a particular piece of hardware that HP will make.""",1306976501

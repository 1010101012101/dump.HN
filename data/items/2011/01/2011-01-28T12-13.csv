You?<p>> Google and other major websites are massively multihomed: they peer with tens or hundreds or perhaps thousands of other ISPs and backbones in as many different peering points around the world.<p>Yes, that was the point, the hosts are still up but you can't reach them. Kill port 53 and the net <i>might</i> as well be dead for 99.9% of all hosts. Most links in google point to other websites, not to google.<p>> 8.8.8.8 is an easy enough number to memorize. So is 8.8.4.4.<p>Yep, those would be first to go. Technically those are under the control of the US military anyway, they're on US soil and within 100 miles of an army base. Or did you think there would be a stand-off between a bunch of nerds and a bunch of military long enough to make a difference?<p>Take out a few key peering locations and the net is dark.<p>In North America I would say Mae-East, Mae-West and Front 151 in Toronto and that would be 70% of the work done, you can mop up after that.<p>> How long do you think it would DNS admins there or anywhere else to fix their servers not to flush their caches?<p>Ironically restarting bind with a new config clears the cache. I'm sure you could find a work-around for that but it might actually be an advantage to start thinking about this ahead of time and making sure that you can survive in 'island' mode without access to DNS.<p>Those DHS seizures targeted the domans for a good reason, people do not access the net through IP addresses conceptually, they use the DNS, the rest of the magic gets hidden under the hood. The HN crowd may be at an advantage in such a situation (it's just another challenge) but I think for the majority of the folks out there it would be curtains.<p>> Certainly less time than it would take the US government to shut down thousands of redundant peering points.<p>I think you're vastly underestimating the capabilities of the US army. There are active reserves in/around every major city, it wouldn't take more than a few hours. Extremely well organized guys with guns are a pretty effective means of shutting down technology.<p>How many sys admins do you know that will take a bullet to keep their router up after being commanded to shut it down?<p>That doesn't mean that I didn't wish you were right, but we can safely assume that if a government that (still) had control of its military decided that its citizens should not longer have internet access that they will not within a few hours of that decision being made.",1296216647
2151548,story,,,2,0,raul_moreno,"What mobile app developers can learn from Oprah.",,"This post assumes you know Operah so lets start by defining Cross-promotion. According to Wikipedia, ”cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies work together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both.”<p>A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines,  and website.<p>The Mutual Benefits of Cross Promoting
Cross promotion benefits both companies  promoting a product. 
In the case of Oprah, if she promotes a book (or app) she is giving her audience a product recommendation that adds value to them because without her recommendation many might not have heard of the product. The Oprah approval is important for her audience, and the probability of a purchase is high.<p>The book owner benefits from the promotion by increasing its sales, Oprah benefits by giving her audience a book that they might not discovered otherwise. Oprah now has connected to her audience with a book, she has become a source of what to read. So its beneficial for Oprah to recommend books. The above recommendation is thus beneficial to Oprah, the book writer, and Oprah’s audience.<p>Promote outside your Apps
As for apps, cross promotion works not only for apps in the same category but many different categories. Imagine if Oprah would promote your app. She can promote it in TV episode that targets a female audience but if she is promoting your app you will benefit  from the promotion. Someone in her audience could recommend your app to a friend, and that friend to another, etc. The important thing is to start getting exposure, and cross promotion is a great tool to start getting initial exposure of your product.The Oprah example is also an example that cross promotion works outside the same category but also outside her own brand. If Oprah were only to promote her own books, her audience would know that is promotion. Oprah’s reading list includes other authors and thus her audience is more trustworthy of her recommendations. Our advice to developers from the initial data we’ve gather from our private beta is don’t be afraid to cross promote outside your brand, category, or even industry, cross promotion works.<p>Kinetik is a cross promotion network for mobile applications. We are the only network that enables developers to choose whom to promote with.  Users can register by invitation only. You can sign up at www.thekinetik.com to get an invite when we are ready.<p>happy coding,<p>Raul Moreno",1296216641

I haven't done it as a unit test before, but I don't think I've ever submitted a bug report to a project that has them...<p>It helps both me and the developer, because the developer can run the code and see if he fixed -my- problem, rather than -a- problem, and I can run it afterwards to verify that it's fixed.  I've also had it show that the same code will hit many bugs before it works...  This allows the developer to fix it all the way down.",1296216290

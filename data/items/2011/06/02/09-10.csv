So transparent.<p>I mean, trying to start Windows 7 launch parties around the world?? Posting on reddit to market some product and ask for ""feedback""? Non-chalantly talking about ""cool stuff""?

There was, in fact, a compromise in the works when the South attacked Fort Sumter and, from a larger perspective, a lot of 19th Century American politics prior to the Civil War was an increasingly desperate dance done by the North to placate the South to prevent the inevitable war.<p>> The time was ripe to replace slavery with automation<p>Read the Cornerstone Speech, given by the Vice President of the CSA. It lays out the reasons they wanted to secede and slavery was foremost among them. Slavery, by that point, wasn't just an economic engine, it was a cultural imperative. Preserving slavery was so ingrained in the Southern mindset that I feel fairly certain the plantation owners would have gone through a certain amount of economic dislocation if that meant keeping the slaves and the social system built on slaves.<p>Besides, even if you're right, the CSA still would never have allowed former slaves equal rights. Not without a race war that successfully toppled the post-slavery CSA establishment by force of arms. In the real world, it took the direct threat of Federal force of arms to ensure the reality of Civil Rights in the South nearly a century after the Civil War. (Admittedly, this is at least partially because Reconstruction didn't go on long enough or go nearly far enough.)",1307007075

2611259,comment,2610243,2611086,2,0,DavidMcLaughlin,,,"> One is dotfree and uses braces. One uses a dot. And one is dotfree and uses parens. I feel like it would be a lot better if there were only one way to do this.<p>I don't disagree with the principal of your complaint, coming from working with Perl I know of the potential horrors of having such flexibility.<p>But just to explain why you can have both braces and parens here. In Scala, if you have a single parameter to a function, you can use braces. This is to allow you to create your own DSLs and control structures. The standard example is:<p><pre><code>    def withPrinter(file: File)(op: PrintWriter => Unit) {\n      val writer = new FileWriter(file)\n      try {\n        op(file)\n      } finally {\n        writer.close()\n      }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nWhich for these types of blog posts we could call as:<p><pre><code>    withWriter(new File(""test.txt""))(_.println(""test""))\n\n</code></pre>\nBut in real applications where function bodies might be more complex, then you can have control abstractions like this:<p><pre><code>    withWriter(new File(""test.txt"")) {\n      writer => writer.println(""test"")\n    }\n\n</code></pre>\nSo used in a tasteful and sensible way, it's a really nice feature.",1307006483

I admit I am somewhat of a fanboy but I feel like it's for a good reason. The language is so easy to read, like reading a sentence. I cannot recall who said this (I want to say Steve Jobs) but its something on the lines of ""something is only perfect when there is nothing left to take away"" .. The fact that Python is missing so many of the crazy symbols and reads more like natural language while still being able to do so much gives me reason to believe it's one of tue greatest scripting languages around, and certainly clowns on Scala for these examples. I really wonder why people continue to write web apps in PHP for example.",1307005602

Not even while using a touch interface do I want to pull something in from the left side of the screen without knowing what will pop out from there. To find the app that I want I have to flip through all of them? That seems that the worst possible way of organizing / not organizing different running apps.<p>What makes it even stranger is that they pass by a much better implementation of the same thing in passing while demoing IE 10, where he pulls down to reveal thumbnails of all the open tabs. Something like that in the main interface would have been much better than having to swipe, swipe, swipe, accidentally pausing videos, replacing views and causing all kinds of frustration just to locate the particular app I was looking for.",1307005455

2611226,comment,2610243,2611086,6,0,tommorris,,,"In Scala '||' does mean logical OR.<p>The example given <i>is</i> using the logical OR to fold across booleans.<p>Imagine this expression:<p><pre><code>    (a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h)\n</code></pre>\nIf any of those values are true, the whole expression evaluates as true. It only evaluates as false if all the values are false.<p>Now consider a simple example in Scala:<p><pre><code>    val res1 = List(false, false, false, false, true)\n    res1.foldLeft(false) { _ || _ }\n</code></pre>\nHere the foldLeft function is 'accumulating' the value of the boolean by doing an OR comparison with the starting value (false). For all but the last one, it is doing (false || false -> false), then it hits the last one and does (false || true -> true).<p>It's a neat trick, and useful if you were using a programming language that had foldLeft but not exists.<p>In Scala, you have exists. So you can do this instead:<p><pre><code>    res1.exists(_ == true)\n</code></pre>\nOr for the example given, something like this:<p><pre><code>    words.exists(tweet.contains(_))</code></pre>",1307005203

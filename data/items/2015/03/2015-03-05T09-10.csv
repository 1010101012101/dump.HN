9149962,comment,9149690,9149690,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"This is a great story, but perhaps not for the reasons intended by the author.<p>I applied once to YC. As I recall, my solo founder video included a puppet, so fair warning: I&#x27;m an idiot when it comes to startups. I only repeat what I&#x27;ve heard and read.<p>When they asked you guys all those questions, the proper answer wasn&#x27;t to reply technically, it was to reply with something akin to &quot;social proof&quot;<p>So, for instance, when they asked &quot;Why are you spending so much time developing this application?&quot;<p>One good answer might be something like &quot;Because we&#x27;ve talked to 50 people, and 10 of them tell us that if we can finish in the next six months, they want to  use it. In fact, here&#x27;s the money they deposited so they would be first in line&quot;<p>The takeaway that YC is only interested in money may be at the same time true and misleading. As I understand those guys, they simply want <i>proof</i> from other humans that you are capable of doing something folks will like. Either you already have those humans and proof -- or they believe that you&#x27;re the kind of guys that can go get them and then they&#x27;ll take a flier on your ability. In either case, to say it&#x27;s money is missing the point.<p>A <i>lot</i> of technical folks confuse the kinds of questions they are getting. When the question is along the lines of &quot;Why don&#x27;t I do X?&quot;, they&#x27;re not asking you to argue that X is better than all other choices. Hell, X may be worse. They&#x27;re asking you to explain to them how by talking to other people, you&#x27;ve learned that a significant percentage of them like X better, even if it sounds stupid. (In fact, if it sounds stupid and looks like something other people would not do, yet real people want it? That&#x27;s a plus!)<p>I liked this. Thank you for posting. Sorry about the negative feedback.<p>ADD: There&#x27;s nothing wrong with building something complex with a grand vision that might take months to put together. The trick is to do it in smaller chunks that get customer validation each step of the way.

They spent 80% of time, money and effort on creature designer - a feature that did not make up even 20% of game, closer to 5%. Game had complex and massive functionality for libraries, various downloadable creatures, even tunes for cities, outfits for citizens - all things that were not just unnecessary, but one might say even made game less attractive (because usually you end up not being such great designer and all cities look equally generically bad).

People tend to forget our body&#x27;s limitations and that all the extra years add to the end, not in the middle.
Not to mention the implications it might have on reproduction. People wont want to have children and slowly our numbers will decline.
Also this will bring up an issue depriving ourself&#x27;s of new Isaac Newtons, Einsteins and all the other bright mind and great people who would have been born and now they aren&#x27;t.
We always forget that strength lies in diversity.
And lastly, do we really want to give immortality to people who do not contribute anything to our society?

Sure, backtracking is a rather simple, if not the most simple approach, but for N=NP kind of problems, presumably, it is the only one and heuristics only change the order of the track, but never reduce complexity.<p>That&#x27;s my layman opinion, that seems to agree with the etymology of <i>reason</i>.

And that The Sims division was a major part of EA (one of three main studios), which made a huge amount of money over a long period of time.<p>You&#x27;re correct to say that Maxis and The Sims franchise enjoyed autonomy and protection thanks to Will Wright, while he was at the company. But after he left, he didn&#x27;t have much to do with it, and it was on its own.<p>Many of the people working The Sims and SimCity franchises were the original people from Maxis or the early days of The Sims at EA, and they did a wonderful job of carrying on without Will. The infamous problems of latest SimCity release were actually Origin&#x27;s fault, which the Maxis people unsuccessfully fought against, and had to take the rap for.<p>Lucy Bradshaw managed The Sims and SimCity since EA acquired Maxis, but EA threw her under the bus by insisting that she make public statements that simply and obviously weren&#x27;t true, in an attempt to justify Origin&#x27;s idiotic and non-negotiable mistakes that they pushed on Maxis.<p>Ocean Quigley was the lead artist for SimCity and The Sims at Maxis since before EA acquired us. Ocean invented the beautiful yet practical hybrid z-buffered 2.5D / real time 3D &quot;holodeck&quot; technology that enabled The Sims 1 to run well on non-accelerated low-end PCs in 2000, which enabled it its widespread success and appeal to casual gamers and young kids (who inherit their older sibling&#x27;s low end PCs).<p>Ocean&#x27;s technical and artistic contributions were as important as Will&#x27;s game design contributions, and he stuck around for much longer. He led the ground-up redesign of SimCity (2013), which I think was both true to the original game, and took it into a totally new territory, away from the terrible tiles, and re-oriented around free-form roads.<p>Ocean and other Maxis employees were rightfully frustrated by Origin&#x27;s interference in SimCity (specifically their insistence on online play, and their initial public pretension that offline play was impossible). After the release, Ocean left to pursue his own projects. After working on Will&#x27;s ideas for so many years, he has a lot of his own original ideas that he wanted to work on. He explained how it was time to step out of Will&#x27;s shadow in this article [1], which I empathize with.<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/19/ocean-quigley-steps-out-of-the-shadow-of-will-wright-interview/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2013/07/19/ocean-quigley-steps-out-of...</a><p>Maxis hired me in January 1997 to work on The Sims (before it was given that name), then EA bought Maxis in July 1997, then we shipped The Sims 1 in February 2000, and I left soon after the release.<p>Then I did some contracting for EA to develop user created content tools like The Sims Transmogrifier, and I worked for Will&#x27;s own company, the Stupid Fun Club, while he was still working for EA on The Sims expansion packs and Spore.<p>At the time, SFC was just Will&#x27;s side project for, well, doing stupid fun stuff.

For this reason we start only talking to people who like our product (but aren&#x27;t customers) and get stuck in a positive feedback loop that isolates us from the hard truth that we might move in a wrong direction. Wrong, not because the idea isn&#x27;t good but wrong because without a market the idea won&#x27;t be sustainable.<p>I wish you all the best guys.

For the most part, it seems like you&#x27;re just making the interviewer feel awkward, and you&#x27;re not really learning anything about the company. I agree with asking them about what they&#x27;re working on. As a soon to be new grad, my experience is limited to only like 2 interviews, but I usually try to ask my interviewers questions pertaining to the specific project they&#x27;re working on. Hopefully, you can find something about their work that interests you and ask them about it.<p>Aside from that, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to look at an interview as a power struggle. It&#x27;s not a you vs. them situation, but rather you&#x27;re both kind of gauging if you want to work together. The first part is kind of where they determine if they want to work with you (gauging your skill) while the second part (your questions and beyond) is kind of where you determine if you want to work with them.<p>As far as things go, unless you&#x27;re well proven, people are probably going to need to gauge your skill in some way. Don&#x27;t get too nervous about the algorithmic questions. Just think of them as a type of puzzle just with much higher stakes. For some practice, if you&#x27;re not familiar with this website: oj.leetcode.com.<p>Disclosure: I don&#x27;t have much experience interviewing.

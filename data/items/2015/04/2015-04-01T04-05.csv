Fifty measures on this scale wouldn&#x27;t stave off the inevitable by even an hour. If this was the most efficient use of our legislators&#x27; time for finding a path to make it through this drought, we are well and truly fucked.<p>You say elsewhere that, while we should fix the big stuff, it doesn&#x27;t hurt to try and deal with the small, too. This completely ignores the fact that legislators and regulatory agencies have <i>actually spent time</i> drafting, discussing, voting on, and implementing these measures. This time would have been infinitely better spent on addressing something that might have a chance in hell of affecting statewide water usage.<p>Edit: I can&#x27;t reply to you, so this will have to suffice. In case you&#x27;ve forgotten, this subthread, all of my replies in it, and seemingly all of your replies as well, have been discussing restrictions on restaurants serving water to customers without prompting. While yes, there is <i>some</i> that California residents and businesses can do to reduce their own water footprint, measures like the one we are discussing are completely and unquestionably pointless.<p>That &quot;evidence&quot; you are looking for is precisely the fact that they have wasted valuable and ever-diminishing time pushing forward measures that will have a absolutely zero discernible impact. Do you truly believe that time by the relevant bodies attempting to regulate water usage amounting to less than 0.001% was time well spent?",1427862926

The first story in the article is of a PhD student. Not everyone is like this, and that&#x27;s worth remembering. A simple example is the vaccines-create-autism movement, full of people who aren&#x27;t digging deep into the treatment or research. They see their child is affected, they are upset, and so they look for something to blame and rail against, causing lots of damage for other people.<p>People certainly feel a lot more in control if they can see what the experts are thinking about their condition, but there is some selection bias in the stories that accompany these articles. On the whole I absolutely think medical records should be shared with patients (except in certain cases, eg discussion of certain mental illnesses), but whatever guidelines we come up with should remember we&#x27;re talking about an issue affecting &quot;the general public&quot; not &quot;PhD students and medical scientists&quot;.",1427861863

Other countries are not like that. They have little competition from online shopping and as a result people there usually pay significant premiums. I recently traveled to so-called shopping capital of the world, i.e. Dubai. My expectation was that everything would be cheaper, well, because most of the Dubai is just made for shopping and its even tax free. I was horrified to find things like Syma 107G at $50 and most other stuff at 20%-50% premiums even at &quot;discount&quot; shops. In my foreign travels, I have yet to encounter a place that consistently beats Amazon on prices anywhere close even with best currency conversion rates and even after high sales taxes in US. Most consumers in world have to pay about 30% margins to retailers while people in US gets away with just 3% - thanks to Amazon.",1427861116

Regardless of your thoughts or beliefs, it&#x27;s just plain <i>easier</i> to ask someone on your team a question face to face rather than needing to open up an IM/chat/mail/hangouts/whateverthefuckitis and do it through there. It&#x27;s not only easier, but it&#x27;s far more fluid and will result in both quicker answers and more discussion since you don&#x27;t need to open up a program, draft up a message, then wait for the other person to type up their response. It all happens in real time, quickly. And in an open office, you get this for free, you don&#x27;t even need to move.<p>Meanwhile, you have not provided a single source to back up the pretty bold claim that private offices don&#x27;t impede collaboration and instead decide to straw man that argument.

9301470,comment,9300373,9300525,0,0,siddboots,,,"I agree.<p>One problem is simply that the notation is linear, while lambda calculus is inherently hierarchical. That problem affects all programming languages to some degree, but it is particularly damaging to the comprehension of lambda terms.<p>Another problem is the complications that are introduced by giving names to variables. This has actually been discussed quite a bit in literature.<p>For example, that the term &quot;λx.xx&quot; is alpha equivalent to &quot;λy.yy&quot;, simply means that the language has redundancy. In fact &quot;alpha equivalence&quot;, &quot;unbound variables&quot;, and &quot;capture avoiding substitution&quot;, are all concepts made necessary by the use of names. If you refuse to name terms, the calculus becomes conceptually simpler. This isn&#x27;t a revalation by any means. Church pointed this out. It just happens that naming things is a very useful thing to do when writing proofs. So we kind of just have to deal with it.<p>Point-free reasoning is a good way to avoid some of these complications, which contributes to the popularity of combinator calculi like SKI when teaching untyped lambda calculus.<p>Another way is to use a graphical representation to depict variable binding more explicitly.

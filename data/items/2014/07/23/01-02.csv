They are a public organisation overlooking all that is related to lottery like casinos, raffles, scratch cards, bingo and all that. They must check every contest and that is a lot of work. They ask for 5% of the main prize in a contest, even if it is an international event in which quebecers have a slim chance to win. This policy was not a problem before the internet.",1406080799

I&#x27;m working on a game called Spire (<a href=""http://hitboxteam.tumblr.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hitboxteam.tumblr.com/</a>), which is a mix of Quake and Roguelikes.  Every procedural dungeon creator I&#x27;ve seen so far seems to just use pre-made rooms or chunks of rooms, and shuffles them around.  It never feels like you&#x27;re in a new world each time, it just feels like you&#x27;re in the same world jumbled up.<p>For the past few years, I&#x27;ve been working on an alternate system, which is to use a goal-oriented design based around the player experience.  Each element in the world is placed purposefully, instead of randomly.\nI do this by emulating the traditional level design process.  I think about every action and intention that goes in creating a level manually, and reduce it to rules for my system.  The goal is that the end result feels crafted to guide the player through an experience, rather than to rely on the player to create a experience for themselves.<p>Examples of the generation behavior:<p>- Lights are placed in areas to guide the players attention towards the primary path, or treasures and dangers.<p>- Geometric features are generated based on spatial aesthetic rules (eg. a pleasing amount of symmetry and repetition), as well as gameplay rules (eg. jump distances based on player capabilities, corridor widths based on desired feeling of claustrophobia and combat difficulty).<p>- Unique color palette for each seed.<p>- Parameters of room construction have emotional analogues (high density -> claustrophobia; harsh angles -> tension; high symmetry -> order; sweeping vistas -> a moment to take a break; gradually lowering elevation -> an unsettling descent).<p>- The curve of emotional parameters over time have varying mathematical relationships to other parameters&#x27; curves, so every seed feels like there is a unique consistency to it.",1406080397

There&#x27;s a grain of truth to what you&#x27;re saying, in that Israel wants to hang on to parts of the west bank that are strategically valuable and have large Jewish settlements, however, even the right-wing Israeli government has no interest in a long-term occupation of Gaza or of much of the West Bank.

Having rockets and mortars shot at, teenagers kidnapped and executed and - last but not least - tunnels spanning kilometers that go underneath its borders and allow dozens of Jihadists to emerge in the middle of a neighborhood, contradicts the safety the government is entrusted to provide its citizens (of which 20% are Arabs, by the way - not that it matters).",1406079575

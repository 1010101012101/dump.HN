5363641,comment,5362085,5363046,1,0,newplagiarist,,,"Having a strong social support network is a good foundation for dealing with depression. My best advice to you is just be available for when he wants to talk. Let him know that if he ever needs to talk, be it day or night, you're there for him and that he can call you. Thoughts of suicidal ideation or self-harm can come at any time and he will need someone to talk to during those times.<p>Onto your other questions. The amount of time that he spends hanging out with any individual won't matter too much; having him be in company with people he enjoys several times a week is what is key. What this means is, it doesn't have to be you particularly but if he is hanging-out with others at least 2 or 3 times a week it would be beneficial.<p>The only boundaries that exist are the ones he implements. Generally, you'll just need to ask him how he's doing and not 'remind' him of his depression everyday, but how often you do that should be down to him to decide.<p>The best piece of advice I can give, is to observe him. If there is a drastic change in behavior or energy level, that is when you need to intervene and either try to get him to talk or just get him out of the house.<p>Overall, the above article is a good basis for coping with depression. The author hinted at, but never explicitly said, two key points that I feel the need to reiterate. If your friend is taking medication or is thinking about medication it can take awhile to take effect, on the magnitude of weeks or months, and that not all depression medication is the same - if one pill isn't working move onto others. Second, if your friend is seeing a therapist, again, not all therapist are the same. If he is not connecting with the therapist personally then his treatment is going to be much less effective.<p>I hope that helps.",1363111184

There are reasons why turn-based single player games have at times been very popular, but many newer entrants seem to have forgotten what those are. The turn-based system gets rid of skillshots at the cost of respondability, which can both improve and degrade approachability.<p>I also wouldn't consider the two offered solutions to both be turn-based. I feel the Travian system of ticks is realtime, whereas the Age of Wonders system is mostly turn-based (though exploitable). I'm on the fence about a Planetarion style system, with sparser ticks - it retains some good parts of turn-based, but adds some bad parts from realtime.<p>I'm pretty sure there has been a multiplayer game like Frozen Synapse, which is the third simultaneous option. I feel like this is the only truly turn-based variant, though a very different system from traditional turn-based games.<p>Of course, there is the final, popular method of simply setting time limits on turns and simplifying the game until turns are fast. I dislike this approach as well - maybe turn-based games are better left in single-player mode.",1363110700

By trust I mean two things.<p>One, professionally, can you trust their judgement?<p>Can you work comfortably knowing that they're going to make decisions that will literally determine the growth/death of the company? You don't have to face this when you work in established companies because no one will have that impact. But in startups, a few wrong decision can turn things bad. If you don't have domain knowledge in what they're working on, you need to be sure that the team is capable in identifying the market and executing the biz.<p>Two, personally, can you be friended with them?<p>Are you comfortable to spend days and nights with them? I've only started working with the team 3 weeks ago and I'm now working with them every weekends. On weekdays, I generally work till after 9:30pm. Are they smart to spot the key, proactive to fix stuff, open to challenge, honest in telling the truth? These are all very important elements that you have to look for if you're to spend lots of time with them.<p>You can't get the real answer until you start working with them. Here's what I did: I worked with the team for free, without any talk of equities. Everyday I just find things that I can contribute and no one in the team can do the same. The founder is very open to me. That helps us working out together. I'd say we just ""fall in partnership"" without much ""discussion"". We observe each other in rounds of negotiations, customer meetings and internal discussions. I keep looking for evidences that the project and the people are ""for long term"".<p>Of course, it does't mean you have to do the same. But I'm suggesting that you look for opportunities to get into real work with them before jumping in, even it's a mini-project. It helps a lot in collecting crucial information. Regarding questions to ask, probably it's about their business just to start with. If even the founder couldn't explain how it works, what problem it solves and where's the market, that's the red flag.<p>Feel free to write to me. My blog & contact in profile. Recently I wrote 3 blog posts on deciding between startups and corporate jobs and you might like to see.<p>Hope it helps. :)",1363109977

As someone who served a bit more than a year in just such an army, let me point out how paying taxes in cash is vastly superior a solution to paying in work:<p>I am an application developer with a very narrow set of ""deep"" skills. Working as such, I get to charge rates that reflect those skills' depth. If I pay my taxes, I am taxed for some 260 days of work at what I'll call my ""peak"" rate.<p>If I were to be drafted to do government work, the probability of me working in that very area is extremely small. Even if, every know and then, I'll get that lucky batch of work, I'd still spend a lot of time getting to know the respective code base, the objectives of that project and, after a week or two of acutal work, passing things on.
Much more likely, I'd end up in an office somewhere. I am somewhat able to hackishly use Excel, so that might be what I'd do: I'd hack up a couple of unmaintainable spreadsheets to solve some problems which I wouldn't actually be proficient in. Were I to do that work for a client, I might, at best, charge half of aforementioned ""peak rate"".
If that government work were to be sloppily organized, I might even end up working outside, cleaning up a forest or assisting in building a road. As you may imagine, I'd be a terrible fit: While I consider myself healthy, I'm not used to outdoor work. At best, I might accomplish 2 hours' worth of skilled labour in an 8 hour day, at worst I'd screw more shit up than I'd fix.<p>Paying cash, I get to contribute at peak_rate * tax_level and leave the government work to people actually hired for their skills, not the amount of available draft days.<p>Also, I assume many a startup wouldn't take too kindly to missing each of their employees for another month a year. Some countries already do (e.g. Switzerland: 300 days of mandatory military service, done (as in ""doing time"", rather than ""serving"") in one part of 21 weeks and some 6 annual parts of three weeks), and while co-workers missing another three weeks per year is certainly bearable, it still seems a mostly useless burden.",1363109565

It's like hiring a tour guide rather than wandering around.<p>If you wander around, you have absolute freedom to discover anything and you'll almost certainly find things that a tour guide wouldn't show you.  However, unless you go in with a comprehensive plan (good luck writing one before you know the topic well!), you'll probably also miss things that the tour guide would definitely cover.<p>If you hire a guide, you're out some money, but you have someone who knows the topic showing you all of the parts that they feel are important.  You have structure and a narrative, which makes it easier to see the big picture.  You can still explore on your own - but when you do so you'll have a base to start from and some ideas about where to go.<p>I've found that I learn best with a mixture of the two.  I'll read a couple chapters of a book, then do a small project or write some exploratory code to cement the knowledge.  In the course of doing that, I'll usually end up reading docs, StackOverflow answers, blog posts, other people's code on Github and other online resources.  When I either finish or hit a wall, I read more and repeat.<p>Of course, there are bad books that make for awful travel guides.  There's no point in having a printed copy of the documentation, or a long-winded book that spends 1,000 pages describing the basic syntax of a straightforward programming language.

The excess can be used to give the people more per capita. Providing ""more"" in whatever sense requires greater productive output.<p>That's the first thing, resources.<p>The second is occupation of time. Not all people need to be employed all the time but with an excess of resources one can concentrate on attaining a higher level of education, healthcare, etc.. These things in turn require more focus on training, more intelligent input to push on to give a greater quality of life for everyone.<p>Yes, more people create greater needs. But with resource limitation and wealth being focussed with a small group those needs simply don't get met, there is not so much more employment as is needed to meet those needs with a degree of quality. Instead what happens is resources get stretched - austerity measures and such.<p>There's also the corollary of economies of scale. Greater production requires a decreasing number of additional personnel.

Instead of having a centralised place for photos, I just dragged photos to /sdcard from my computer, and looked at them that way. When I had to put music on my phone in a hurry, I did the same, and navigated to them in the file manager instead of having it in the music app. I had a bunch of Markdown files that were there, too, whenever I synced manually. Now I can do all that without having to worry about where the files are, using iTunes and iCloud.<p>Since then, every time I've seen someone have to open a file manager, it's to do a job an app could have done. That's why Apple doesn't want to include one - it gives users more functionality, but makes app developers lazy. It's the same reason they haven't decided to include a stylus: it's technically more precise, but would just cause developers to think ""don't worry about finger click targets, the user has a stylus"".",1363108852

No of course not, they'll say the name of their cleaning wo/man and trash them, because why should they give a shit? I mean it's ""just"" the cleaner.  The waitress at the bar?

5363167,comment,5359458,5361317,2,0,AnthonyMouse,,,"> If you only have a minimum income, then monopoly/oligopoly providers will raise their prices to absorb the entire minimum income.<p>Uncompetitive markets are a different animal. Even if you had the government making the purchasing decisions, non-competing suppliers could still just charge monopoly prices that increase as additional dollars become available. The only real solution to that is to make the market more competitive, e.g. busting up the cartels and adopting policies that inhibit them from forming.<p>But you're almost onto something. The issue is that when your goal is to increase the number of transactions in a market (e.g. the number of people who can buy a home), increasing the demand by increasing the cash in peoples' pockets is only an indirect method to accomplish that. In order for more people to be able to own a home, there have to actually be more homes. If you give people money then they bid up housing prices, which causes new home construction to be more profitable and so more new homes are constructed. The trouble is that the large bulk of the money doesn't make it to the people constructing new homes, it goes primarily to the sellers of existing homes (who comprise the bulk of the market), and so only a small fraction of the tax dollars expended go toward promoting new home construction and therefore to increasing the number of people who can buy a home. Directly subsidizing supply is a much more effective way to accomplish specific goals like that, e.g. by providing money when a <i>newly constructed</i> home is purchased. Then the subsidy is distributed between the buyers (making the purchase more affordable) and the new home builders (increasing the incentive to build more new homes) and cuts the existing home owners you didn't intend to subsidize out of the subsidy.<p>This is basic supply side economics. The key is to recognize how this sort of thing has been corrupted into not accomplishing its goals in the past: If the market being subsidized is uncompetitive then the suppliers can fix prices so as to take most or all of the subsidy as profit and cause little or no increase in supply at all. In other words, you should never, ever subsidize a cartel. Subsidies for oil exploration come to mind as a good example of this sort of preposterous stupidity. But again, the solution in those cases is to make the market competitive. Either bust them up or, if you can't (e.g. because OPEC is outside your jurisdiction), promote new competition like alternative energy.<p>TL;DR: You don't have to have the government supply the services, you just have to have the government make sure the market stays competitive.",1363108074

Netflix. They're bigger than I will be until such time my company can afford to buy it's own data centers. At that point, I can re-evaluate.
2) Operational overhead. Startup, running hundreds of hosts, thousands of requests per second, 5 developers, 0 sys-engineers.
3) Lock in. We use Cloudwatch, Dynamo, RDS, Beanstalk, S3, EMR and more. We also use Heroku. No one else out there has the full suite of offerings. Not using AWS would require us to stitch together offerings from several vendors, some technology wouldn't be feasible having to hop across the internet (do you want the lag to get to your database from one data center to another?)
4) Billing. We get 1 Bill which we can predict. AWS takes credit cards, will do Net 30 billing, and are generally pretty flexible. 
5) Customer Service. Don't get me wrong, support at AWS is ... not it's strong suit. We also don't spend enough to be a ""big fish"". However, if we used 10 different providers to get our infrastructure together, we'd me a minnow to each one. By consolidating, we're a small-medium sized customer which is enough to get into beta's, info on their roadmap ahead of time, and some personal service. 
6) Excuses for downtime. So many high profile companies are on AWS that if we have an outage directly attributable to AWS, the odds are a lot of the rest of the internet is down, too. Seriously. It sounds stupid, but it's a huge reason. 2 years ago we were raising money. Right in the middle of our final week (when all our investors were visiting our site and making sure they really wanted to sign on the dotted line), we had an outage that lasted several days. This was the AWS outage that took out Heroku for a few days, and ours was one of the last databases to get restored. If we were using almost anyone else, investors might have been like ""oh, this team doesn't really know what they're doing, they're not really that technically competent, I'm not going to invest"". But since Netflix, Foursquare, and dozens of other companies were all offline at the same time, the investors were just like ""they're using AWS, if Netflix can't keep online with hundreds of engineers, then I'm not going to expect that this little startup is going to do better"".
7) Could I really do it better? Is anyone else doing better? AWS is the leader, so we all see the warts ... but at least they keep their certs updated (<i>ahem</i> microsoft)",1363107781

5363116,comment,5362085,5362085,29,0,bpatrianakos,,,"I don't think one can actually <i>beat</i> depression but instead only really cope with the symptoms. I know that sounds awful and kind of defeatist (and I could be wrong) but I think the idea that you can actually conquer this disease sets you up for failure.<p>I first noticed my own depression when I was just a 13 year old kid and first sought help just before the end of high school. I've been through the entire range of emotion from hopelessness to being suicidal and through it all I was always most upset that I couldn't actually beat it. I would try and fight so hard to make it just go away permanently and be like ""normal"" people but it just never happened. I eventually took to self medicating and became a polydrug abusing heroin addict for about 5 years.<p>Five years later I realize that, for me, there is no ""beating"" it. There's just learning to cope with it. Before I realized this my main focus was trying to make the terrible way I felt just go away and to be happy. Now, rather than fight it, I work around it. I realize that a negative mood or feeling of worthlessness is not objectively true but instead just part of the sickness just like the author here says.<p>In addition to most of what this post talked about I would say the most important thing is knowledge of self. To recognize and realize that what you're experiencing at any given time is really a complete distortion of reality is step one to recovering. Then to know what triggers those thoughts and knowing what works best for you in terms of mitigating them is the ultimate goal (with the understanding, of course, that you may not be able to completely defeat the experience but certainly minimize it). I learned these things and now, five years later, I still have depression but it's not debilitating. Whenever it decides to come around I'm able to push it aside completely or mitigate those symptoms and I've been able to do that because I've built the kind of lifestyle where people rely on me and I'm often running from one activity to another. Some might say it sounds like running from the disease but really my busy lifestyle is what keeps it at bay. Rather than having the time to dwell on how awful life is and how worthless of a person I am, at worst I'll have thoughts like ""shit, now I have to go do this thing and I totally suck at it and everyone hates me"" which isn't exactly a great thought but certainly beats being alone thinking of killing yourself and when I finally reach my destination and do whatever I need to do I've proven to myself that whatever I was thinking before was just plain wrong. Again, that's a worst case scenario. I've gotten to a point now where thoughts like that are the minority thankfully.<p>So I'd just hope anyone else struggling with clinical depression is able to take a step back and evaluate their own thinking, understanding their own vulnerabilities and coping mechanisms in addition to seeking out lots of professional help (and yeah, exercising is amazing for this disease).",1363107684

As well as that they also have an interesting team behind them as well for instance their CEO Thejo Kote, was previously a founder of NextDrop[1] which provides <i>real</i> value to people in India by informing them when nearby water is available (In case youre not aware of this, despite having water pipes to them, water in India is only available for a few hours (usually once or twice a week) at a time and they have no way of knowing when that time actually is).<p>The product is useful for some of the reasons listed on their website such as the Crash Alert, Engine Health, Where You Parked etc. Although the biggest interest they will receive is through, external parties such as Rental Companies and Car Insurance providers etc (In otherwords, I predict their market is far bigger on the business than the Consumer side although, in some instances they overlap). The Car Insurance feature may actually become their biggest feature for consumers in the future going forward With Automatic you can get an Engine Health Check, Remember Where You Parked, In The Event of a Crash Inform the Right People and more importantly save $100s on your Car Insurance!<p>For instance, in the UK there are a lot of car insurance providers who give discounts to drivers who get a telematics policy aka install a black box within their car (something similar to Automatic without the additional features). These telematics policies in the UK are offered in 3 categories (the Behaviour-Based is the most common):<p>- Curfew-Based Policies  if you dont drive between 11pm  5am you get a discount<p>- Low Mileage Policies<p>- Behaviour-Based Policies (which Automatic does with their Drive Score  points system) which considers how will you corner, brake and speed etc so the better you drive your insurance becomes cheaper, you drive badly you get penalised with higher rates etc.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nextdrop.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nextdrop.org</a>",1363107628

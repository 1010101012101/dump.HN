94385,comment,93534,93534,0,0,ChrisJ,,,"While the article makes some good points, I can't say I agree with it 100%.  When considering the first sentence, ""As our knowledge and expertise increase, our creativity and ability to innovate tend to taper off."", I think this is very inaccurate when it comes to ""new-growth"" areas like the internet of today.  In fact, to me the opposite is true, the more I learn, the more creative I feel because it's still very possible to do something on the 'Net that hasn't been done before.  adf471587879rzq",1199313659

It was just a text box that echoed on a webpage. Pretty mild effort, and if he actually got ""incredibly positive reviews"" then he's got far too many ass-kissers hanging around him.",1199312422

The last couple of posts have not been so insightful as the first and leave large ""what if""s unanswered. I will keep checking back for sure to see if another gem appears though. Maybe I am too wrapped up in looking for the bridge that takes me from intent and effort to success.",1199311499
